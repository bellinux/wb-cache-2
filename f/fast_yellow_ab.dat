50|$|<b>Fast</b> <b>Yellow</b> <b>AB</b> is an azo dye. It {{used to be}} used as a food dye, {{designated}} in Europe by the E number E105. It is now delisted in both Europe and USA and {{is forbidden}} if used in foods and drinks, as toxicological data has shown it is harmful. E105 has been implicated in non-atopic asthma.|$|E
40|$|Pd-based {{catalytic}} reduction {{has emerged as}} an advanced treatment technology for drinking water decontamination, and a suite of persistent contaminants including oxyanions, N-nitrosoamines, and halogenated compounds are amenable to {{catalytic reduction}}. The primary goal {{of this study is}} to develop novel Pd-based catalysts with enhanced performance (i. e., activity, selectivity, and sustainability) to remove contaminants from drinking water. The effects of water quality (i. e., co-contaminants in water matrix), catalyst support, and catalyst metal were explored, and they provide insights for preparing catalysts with faster kinetics, higher selectivity, and extended lifetime. Azo dyes are wide-spread contaminants, and they are potentially co-exisiting with target contaminants amenable for catalytic removal. The probe azo dye methyl orange (MO) enhanced catalytic reduction kinetics of a suite of oxyanions (i. e., nitrate, nitrite, bromate, chlorate, and perchlorate) and diatrizoate significantly but not N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA) with a variety of Pd-based catalysts. Nitrate was selected as a probe contaminant, and several different azo dyes (i. e., methyl orange, methyl red, <b>fast</b> <b>yellow</b> <b>AB,</b> metanil yellow, acid orange 7, congo red, eriochrome black T, acid red 27, acid yellow 11, and acid yellow 17) were evaluated for their ability to enhance reduction. A hydrogen atom shuttling mechanism was proposed and a kinetic model was proposed based on Brønsted–Evans–Polanyi (BEP) theory, and they suggest sorbed azo dyes and reduced hydrazo dyes shuttle hydrogen atoms to oxyanions or diatrizoate t...|$|E

40|$|Using an {{open air}} flow system, {{differences}} in the yellowing rate of leaves during curing were assessed in relation to ethylene production by shoots of intact seedlings or attached mature leaves of 60 day old tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum L.) plants. The rate of ethylene evolution from {{the leaves of the}} <b>fast</b> <b>yellowing</b> cultivars was significantly higher than in the slow yellowing ones. The same differences were obtained with shoots of intact seedlings. The findings suggest {{that it is possible to}} use ethylene production by seedlings as a selection criterion in screening for genotypic {{differences in the}} rate of yellowing. The ability of carbon dioxide (1 %) to enhance ethylene production by attached leaves was significant in a slow, but not in a <b>fast</b> <b>yellowing</b> cultivar. However, similar amounts of ethylene were produced on administration of 1 -aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid to a slow and a <b>fast</b> <b>yellowing</b> cultivar. Exposure of attached leaves to exogenous ethylene (0. 1 microliter per liter) accelerated the loss of chlorophyll and protein. This treatment was effective only for slightly yellow leaves and not for fully expanded green ones. The significance and possible use of ethylene in the flue-curing process are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{a global}} economy the {{packaging}} industry has explored the usage of thermochromic ink to create a visual impact. The {{purpose of this study}} was to measure the color intensity of Matsui Chromicolor screen printing ink. The appearance of a product has the ability to attract attention from potential consumers. For this study both the scientific method and elite and specialized interviews were used to determine the reliability of Matsui Chromicolor ink. Samples of both Brilliant Green Type 27 and <b>Fast</b> <b>Yellow</b> Type 27 ink were heated in a scientific oven according to Matsui specifications. The results indicate that Matsui has been able to reach a degree of consistency in their ink, which could lead to consistent production, and appearance of color on products printed with thermochromic ink. There are potential areas for improvement within the thermochromic ink industry. However, further research is needed to test the accuracy of thermochromic ink...|$|R
50|$|Milky white, abdomen orange {{with black}} dorsal dots. Forewing more or loss {{sprinkled}} with sharply defined black dots, {{of which there}} are always some at the costa and others arranged in rows in the disc. Hindwing with discal dots and often with anal ones and others. Antennae black. In specimens from northern Scotland the forewing is sandy <b>yellow,</b> <b>ab.</b> ochrea, also found elsewhere as an exception among. The forewing may be darkened to brown; this is the case in ab. brunnea Ober. In ab. luxerii Godt. the forewing is suffused with rose-red distally and brownish proximally. In ab. walkeri Curt, the dots merge to form radial streaks. In Japan it usually occurs in the form sangaica Walk. which is only distinguished from lubricipeda by the sparse dots, especially in the outer area of theforewing. Specimens similar to sangaica occur aberratively also in Europe, bearing the name paucipuncta Fuchs and in contradistinction to it there is the very strongly dotted krieghoffi Pabst. A still further reduction of the dots leads to ab. unipuncta Strand, in which there is only one dot on the hindwing. -punctarium Cr. full species Spilosoma punctarium is distinguished from lubricipeda by the carmine abdomen with sharp transverse spots, and by the wings being rather more spotted.|$|R

The adsorption of <b>fast</b> <b>yellow</b> dye onto dried biomass Padina pavonica was studied in batch experiments. The amount of dye adsorbed (mg/g) was increased {{with the increase in}} initial dye concentration. An equilibrium time of about 90 min was achieved for dye concentrations ranging from 5 to 160 mg/L with maximum removal percentage of 73. 2 %. Pseudo-first and second order kinetic models have been used to analyze the adsorption data. The pseudo second-order kinetic model adequately described the adsorption data with correlation coefficient between 0. 96 and 1. 084. Fourier transform infra-red analysis demonstrated the chelating character of the dye molecule to different functionalities groups of the alga. Stirring speed higher than 50 rpm revealed no significant changes in dye adsorption. Temperature ranging from 15 ˚C to 65 ˚C showed stability followed by a decrease in adsorption. Scanning electron microscopy of adsorbent particles showed a high surface porosity allowing the free passage of dye molecules...|$|R
