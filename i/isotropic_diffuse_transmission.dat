40|$|Data from 105 {{days from}} the High Altitude Water Cherenkov Observatory (HAWC) {{have been used to}} place a new limit on an <b>isotropic</b> <b>diffuse</b> gamma-ray {{population}} above 10 TeV. High- energy <b>isotropic</b> <b>diffuse</b> gamma-ray emission is produced by unresolved extragalactic objects such as active galactic nuclei, with potential contributions from interactions of high-energy cosmic rays with the inter-Galactic medium, or dark matter annihilation. <b>Isotropic</b> <b>diffuse</b> gamma-ray emission has been observed up to nearly 1 TeV. Above this energy, only upper limits have been reported. Observations or limits of the isotropic photon population above these energies are very sensitive to local astrophysical particle production. Of particular note, we expect a photon population to accompany the TeV-PeV astrophysical neutrino detection seen in the IceCube instrument. Observations or limits of a photon population above this energy can point to the origin of these neutrinos, indicating whether they are within the gamma-ray horizon or not. HAWC, with superior sensitivity to gamma rays between 100 GeV and 100 TeV, continuously observes the overhead sky and will measure or constrain isotropic emission above 1 TeV. We present a limit above 10 TeV based on the background rejection achieved in a 105 -day observation of the Crab Nebula with HAWC. The limit will improve substantially with additional data and study.

The expected <b>isotropic</b> <b>diffuse</b> signal from dark matter annihilation has contributions from the local Milky Way (MW) {{as well as from}} extragalactic dark matter. The signal from the MW is very insensitive to the adopted dark matter profile of the halos, and dominates the signal from extragalactic halos, which is sensitive to the low mass cut-off of the halo mass function. We adopt a conservative model for both the low halo mass survival cut-off and the substructure boost factor of the Galactic and extragalactic components, and only consider the primary final state radiation. This provides robust constraints which reach the thermal production cross-section for low mass WIMPs annihilating into hadronic modes. We also reanalyze limits from HESS observations of the Galactic Ridge region using a conservative model for the dark matter halo profile. When combined with the HESS constraint, the <b>isotropic</b> <b>diffuse</b> spectrum rules out all interpretations of the PAMELA positron excess based on dark matter annihilation into two lepton final states. Annihilation into four leptons through new intermediate states, although constrained by the data, is not excluded.

However, the acoustic mismatch model (diffuse mismatch model) is based on the hypothesis of a perfectly smooth (completely disordered) interface.

40|$|<b>Diffuse</b> <b>transmission</b> and diffusing-wave {{spectroscopy}} (DWS) {{can be used}} {{to probe}} the structure and dynamics of opaque materials such as colloids, foams, and sand. A crucial step is to model photon transport as a diffusion process. This approach is acceptable for optically thick samples, far into the limit of strong multiple scattering; however, it becomes increasingly inaccurate for thinner samples for several reasons. Here, we correct for two of these defects. By modeling photon propagation by a telegrapher equation with suitable boundary conditions, we can account for the ballistic transport of photons at finite speed between successive scattering events. By introducing a discontinuity in the photon concentration at the source point, and then averaging over a range of penetration depths, we can account for the fact that photons usually scatter anisotropically into the forward direction, rather than being completely randomized at each event. The accuracy of our approach is tested by comparison both with random walk computer simulations and with experiments on specially designed suspensions of polystyrene spheres. We find that our predictions extend the utility of <b>diffuse</b> <b>transmission</b> to slabs of all thicknesses and of DWS to slabs down to about two transport mean free paths...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the <b>isotropic</b> <b>diffuse</b> gamma-ray background, {{as measured by}} the Fermi gamma ray space telescope, and its implications for indirect detection of dark matter. We describe the measurement of the isotropic background, including also an alternative analysis method besides the one published by the Fermi-LAT collaboration. The measured <b>isotropic</b> <b>diffuse</b> background is compatible with a power law differential energy spectrum with a spectral index of  - 2. 41 ± 0. 05 and - 2. 39 ± 0. 08, for the two analysis methods respectively. This is a softer spectrum than previously reported by the EGRET experiment. This rules out any dominant contribution with a significantly different shape, e. g. from dark matter, in the energy range 20 MeV to 102. 4 GeV. Instead we present upper limits on a signal originating from annihilating dark matter of extragalactic origin. The uncertainty in the dark matter signal is primarily dependent on the cosmological evolution of the dark matter distribution. We use recent N-body simulations of structure formation, as well as a semi-analytical calculation, to assess this uncertainty. We investigate three main annihilation channels and find that in some, but not in all, of our scenarios we can start to probe, and sometimes rule out, interesting parameter spaces of particle physics models beyond the standard model. We also investigate the possibility to use the angular anisotropies of the annihilation signal to separate it from a background originating from conventional sources, e. g. from active galactic nuclei. By carefully modelling the performance of the Fermi gamma-ray space telescope and galactic foregrounds we find that this method could be as sensitive as using information from the energy spectrum only.
