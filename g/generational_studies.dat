The surveys have been conducted in twelve regions: Astrakhan and the Astrakhan region, Groznyy, Ivanovo, Krasnodar, Maikop, Makhachkala, Moscow, Nazran, Nalchik, Pskov and Stavropol. The project focuses on the views and values of the younger generations, on their conflict and tolerance potential. The main goal of the project is to support the younger generations capable of confronting and overcoming life difficulties, of suppressing one’s negative and conflict reactions, of protecting one’s interests and respecting the interests of others, which would lead to the development of culture of tolerance and consent and to preventing xenophobia manifestations. For the study of ethnic-social attitudes, for the identification of conflict potential, for the prevention of conflicts and manifestations of xenophobia and extremism, the researchers developed an ethnic-conflict monitoring in the framework of the international project “Dialogue Partnership as a Factor of Stability and Integration” (“Bridge between East and West”) and the program “Youth of Polyethnic Regions: Views, Attitudes, Values” (the author is the founder {{and the head of the}} project and the program).

Even so, it remains understudied by urban historians of the pre-modern period. This book aims to fill some of this gap, containing twelve studies of generations in late medieval and early modern European towns, ranging from the Mediterranean to the Nordic countries, with a time-span from the fourteenth to the early nineteenth century. Dealing with topics like succession and inheritance, family consciousness, as well as relations and conflicts within and between generations, the articles demonstrate the importance and potential of <b>generational</b> <b>studies</b> on pre-modern towns. The book will appeal to anyone who takes an interest in urban social and cultural history, legal and family history in medieval and early modern times...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} how older people, {{living in}} Spain, use smartphones and smartphone applications. Using a mixed methods approach, we compare quantitative results obtained by tracking mobile app usage amongst different generational samples with qualitative, focus-group discussions with active smartphone users. A sample of Spanish smartphone users were tracked during one {{month in the}} winter of 2014 (238 individuals, aged 20 to 76 years-old). This was followed by three focus group sessions conducted in the spring of 2015, with 24 individuals aged 55 to 81. As we learned, WhatsApp is currently the most popular application used by people of all ages, including older adults. Smartphones increasingly are playing {{a central role in the}} life of older participants, although the frequency of app access is negatively correlated with age. On the other hand, as our data indicates, older adults also use a number of different types of apps that are distinct from that of younger users. Older participants access personal information manager apps (calendar, address book and notes) more often than other age groups. And comparatively, older participants use the smartphone less often in stable locations (home, office, relatives’ home) with Wifi than somewhere else and with mobile data. As we argue, differences in age seem to reflect the evolution in personal interests and communication patterns that change as we grow older. Our study captures new trends in smartphone usage amongst this cohort. It also indicates how a combination of methods may help to assess the validity of the log and qualitative data. We highlight the relevance of conducting careful <b>generational</b> <b>studies</b> in smartphone use and some of the potentials and limitations of making predictive studies of ICT use as we change throughout the life course. Finally, we assert the value of the inclusion of older representatives within research, which ultimately may influence public decisions and the design of new technologies...|$|E

The stress of day to day demands on their lives precluded them the opportunity to reflect on the underlying causes and historical roots of their circumstances.

40|$|Since {{the naming}} of the Chinese Fifth Generation in the 1980 s, <b>generational</b> <b>study</b> became an {{important}} methodology in Chinese film studies. The Chinese directors up to the mid- 1980 s are categorised into five generations. However, the directors emerging after the Fifth Generation do not so far have a certain generational name. Thus, the identification of this “nameless” group, which is called the post-fifth generation in this thesis, is an interesting issue reflecting the political, economical and cultural discourse in contemporary China. This thesis focuses on these directors’ films narrated with female protagonists, probes {{the reason why they}} chose female-centred narratives, and examines how they portrayed women and women’s stories in their filmic representation. In the light of Foucault’s theories of discourse and power, I examine the films as a kind of representation which is generated within discursive formation, and through which the directors identify themselves. The conclusion reached by the discussion is that both the female and the male directors studied in this thesis present very feminine discourse in their films. While the female directors are emphasising, even advertising their identity as women, their male counterparts are trying very hard to simulate and perform a feminine identification. This finding exactly answers the question in the thesis title. Since femininity is something that can be chosen, simulated, used, and played, the word “feminist” can also become a cultural brand from which the directors can benefit...|$|R
40|$|The {{concepts}} of lifelong learning {{and professional development}} have become axiomatic within the teaching profession. Indeed, some authors (Australian Council of Deans of Education, 2001; Sachs 2003) argue that lifelong learning {{is the hallmark of}} the activist teaching professional and should underpin all teaching practice and beliefs. Furthermore, educational reforms, such as Queensland, Australia's "New Basics" (Education Queensland, 2000), assume that practicing and potential teachers are predisposed and amenable to ongoing professional development. However, younger teachers do not necessarily understand these concepts {{in the same way as}} older teachers may do. In this paper I explore how some preservice teachers, who are members of the "Y Generation", understand the concept of lifelong learning and what this might mean for their professional development. "Y Generation" individuals were predominantly born between the years 1979 and 1984. This exploration draws upon new empirical data generated from a larger study where 70 young, aspiring primary school teachers, who reside in the South-East region of Queensland, Australia, were asked to either formulate or critique scenarios of the future. Data were collected using scenario-planning workshops, focus group interviews, and a telephone survey and analysed using Gee's (1999) theoretical {{concepts of}} cultural models and Discourses. It will be seen that these future teachers are a paradox. While they acknowledge and champion the concept of lifelong learning, they have a limited understanding of what it might mean for their future lives and particularly their future teaching careers and their teaching practices. Specifically, these future teachers frame their understanding of and engagement with lifelong learning strictly within a technological context. If the expectation is that teaching professionals continually engage in lifelong learning as a means to professional development, then it is of some concern that this cohort of aspiring teachers will enter into the profession with a restricted and truncated understanding of their future professional roles and responsibilities. This study challenges some of the precepts associated with lifelong learning and contributes to a number of fields of study and current and future practices in policy development and teacher training. Firstly, it makes a significant contribution to the fields of futures studies and <b>generational</b> <b>studies</b> where there has been a paucity of studies that have investigated "Y Generation" pre-service teachers and their understanding of their future roles as teaching professionals. It also contributes to the research areas of educational reform and teacher education by providing an alternative perspective and some important considerations for those currently involved in preparing young people to be future activist teaching professionals.

40|$|Author email: stevendavidhitchcock@gmail. comThe Millennial generation, {{those born}} between 1980 - 2000, have drawn vast, {{sometimes}} fanatical, criticism in popular media. Slated as narcissistic praise hounds, they are cast as demanding graduate divas who {{are about to}} attack the workplace and everything ‘you hold sacred’ (Clark, 2008; Safer, 2007). The abundance of such messages about this generation in formats ‘tailored, targeted, and consumed’ by the public is problematic given that generational constructs are by many perceived as sacrosanct (Myers et al, 2010). The proliferation of such criticism {{is by no means}} innocuous given the very likely impact that they will have on Millennial work opportunities. For many scholars the field of Millennial research suffers from a lack of empirical and cross sectional data to establish more calculated and careful generational constructs, – instead relying on or reacting to popular negative stereotypes. While some Millennial scholarship has begun to move beyond criticisms of popular media, Millennial research is by many considered contradictory at best and confusing at worst (Kowske et al, 2010). Additional difficulties arise when the scramble to publish more research-based work has led to methodologies which are inherently flawed because they reinforce the very same monolithic generational categories they are supposed to assess. This study, undertaken in New Zealand, explores critical approaches as a means of examining the construction of generational messages and the establishment of generational difference. As a starting point, this small-scale examination analyses the very way in which generational messages are constructed and resisted within the workplace through an analysis of interviews undertaken with 26 employees of a Small to Medium Enterprise (SME) in the information technology sector. Unlike many <b>generational</b> <b>studies,</b> this project did not seek to draw conclusions by framing differences and measuring responses across generational lines, but rather took a bottom-up approach to understand how participants themselves constructed and resisted messages about generational difference. The project asked two research questions: First, how are generational messages constructed {{in the context of the}} workplace? And second, how are generational messages resisted in the workplace? Through axial coding this research categorized five themes under which participants constructed generational difference. These five themes are Technology, Voice, Fairness, Informality, and Stimulus. Broadly speaking, these themes were underpinned by a belief that Millennials have a great demand for respect, democratic process, and the reduction of power distances. Given the critical approach, the study also observed resistance as a component of the discursive process. As such this research outlines the partiality of resistance and outlines strategies of resistance employed by employees. In line with the idea that construction and resistance are mutually implicated as negotiation, participants were frequently observed simultaneously constructing and resisting generational difference, both synchronically and diachronically. Through axial coding this study also categorized three strategies of resistance. These three strategies are established as Dismissal, the Third Person Effect, and the Decline Metaphor. This research highlights the usefulness of adopting critical approaches by illustrating the way in which generational meaning is perpetually produced, reproduced, negotiated, and resisted by participants (Murphy, 1998). While there are several factors which are indicative of the Millennial generation, this thesis establishes the hegemonic character of most constructions of generational difference. Given the fragmented and complex state of society, this thesis posits that the usefulness of the monolithic birth-cohort generation has long since passed and we should instead look to understanding generations in terms of their consumption of similar cultural capital...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1996 This was a <b>generational</b> <b>study</b> on Japanese American {{women that}} {{evaluated}} Hill's propositions regarding discontinuity in values and acceleration of achievement in occupational level across generations. The domains examined were 1) elder care, 2) family structure, and 3) employment & occupation. It {{was hypothesized that}} there will be differences between the second and third generations, {{that there will be}} a trend towards greater discontinuity in traditional Japanese values and rules across Japanese American generations in elder care, family structure, and employment. Further, it was hypothesized {{that there will be a}}n advancement in occupational level across these generations. A survey instrument incorporating both close and open-ended questions was used to explore these research statements and hypotheses. Participants for this study included 168 Japanese American women in Northwestern region, mainly Oregon (89 second generation and 79 third generation). Quantitative methodologies were employed to analyze the data obtained from self-administered questionnaires. Results revealed a mixed support to Hill's intergenerational propositions. For example, second generation women lean towards non-traditional attitudes with regard to elder care but were more traditional with regard to women's employment, particularly for mothers of small children. This could reflect a complicated process in which second generation women draw on the traditional value of sacrificial motherhood and extend it throughout the lifecourse by adjusting it through their own caregiving experiences to their elderly parents: an example of how an unique synthesis emerges out of the conflicting old and new ideas. Such finding gives an important indication that generational change is not of linear characteristics as Hill suggests but of non-linear one...|$|R
40|$|Variation in {{transgene}} expression {{levels can}} result from uncontrolled differences in experimental proto-cols. Studies conducted over generations could, by their design, generate additional unwanted variation. To study sources of spurious variation, transgene expression levels were quanti®ed over ®ve homo-zygous generations in two independent transgenic rice lines created by particle bombardment. Both lines contained the same gus expression unit and had been shown to exhibit stable inheritance of transgene structure and expression. All plants were cultured and sampled using previously developed standardized protocols. Plants representative of each generation (T 2, T 3, T 4, T 5, T 6) were grown either all together or across several different growth periods. GUS activity in plants from different generations was quanti®ed either in the same assay or over multiple independent assays. Strategies in which plants were grown and phenotyped independently, signi®cantly increased (up to 3 -fold) extraneous variation in trans-gene expression level quanti®cation, thus reducing the precision of molecular genetic studies and generating artefactual results in transgenic studies conducted over generations. Identi®cation of sources of unwanted variation and quanti®cation of their effect allowed {{the development of new}} strategies designed to control spurious variation. Growth and phenotyping of all plants from all generations together, using standard operating procedures (SOP), led to a reduction in extraneous variation associated with transgene expression level quanti®cation.

Both parents and children view modern social media as having both positive and negative consequences, and largely maintain that face-to-face communication is more desirable than communicating through social media. This study examines social media and parent-child communication in the context of Instructional-Affective Communication Theory and Media Richness theory, and presents findings of an originally conducted survey to examine the trends in social media use among children and their parents and what these trends imply regarding interpersonal communication...|$|R

Such predictions are important if the Asia-Pacific region {{is to reach}} its tourism potential. This study investigates the domestic travel motivations of 632 Australian Baby Boomer, Generation X, and Generation Y travelers to uncover each generational cohort's travel mindset. Specifically, it considers how the sociohistorical environment when its members "came of age" during adolescence (i. e., thus creating a generation), create a unique lifelong perspective that influences both current and future tourist behavior. Although the survey {{results show that the}} travel decision-making process is similar across cohorts, model comparisons reveal <b>generational</b> differences. This <b>study</b> advances the theoretical {{understanding of}} the implications of generational perspectives on future travel behavior and provides foresight into demand factors that will drive future travel growth in the Asia-Pacific region and particularly growth in domestic leisure travel by Australians.

40|$|Contemporary aging {{societies}} are age-graded {{and to a}} large extent age-segregated societies. Their institutions tend to be age-homogeneous (Uhlenberg & Riley, 2000). Relations and transfers between generations are critical for maintaining age integration. This is especially obvious {{at the level of the}} family. Families link lives far beyond the co-residing nuclear unit, most prominently along the <b>generational</b> lineage. The <b>study</b> of family transfers among adult generations is important for at least four main fields of sociological inquiry: • for life course research where it follows the balance of giving and receiving across the life course, and highlights the position of the elderly as net givers; • for research on social security where it complements our understanding of the family as a pillar of the contemporary welfare mix; • for stratification research where it draws attention to the fact that the transfer of social status is not over at the beginning of adulthood but continues by other means...|$|R
40|$|The {{tendency}} to repeat birth weight in successive birth {{was first published}} in 1977. The study was based on 81 400 mothers who had their first and second singleton birth within the study period 1967 - 73, based on information in the Medical Birth Registry of Norway. The paper was presented at a large NICHD (National Center of Child Health and Human Development, NIH) seminar focusing on preterm birth. This meeting started a creative, international long lasting collaboration, a series of papers and book chapters has been published. It seemed like mothers are programmed to give birth to babies of a certain size and age. And if they depart from this norm the baby is at an increased risk of mortality. Also, the {{tendency to}} repeat gestational age and birth weight exists across generations, with the same increased risk if the pattern is departed from. This means that if a mother who herself was of low birth weight give birth to a likewise small baby, then that baby has improved survival compared to a likewise small baby where the mother was relatively heavy. This effect across generations is also present on the paternal in addition to the maternal side. Recently the medical birth registration data set has provided possibilities to examine the effect of changing partners from one pregnancy to the next one. Also, half siblings (maternal and paternal) is another valuable data source to explore. Soon 3 <b>generational</b> repeater <b>studies</b> will become available as the first births in the registry by now become grandmothers and grandfathers...|$|R
40|$|Coauthored {{scholarship}} increased substantially across {{fields of}} science during the twentieth century, {{but it is}} unclear whether this growth reflects change in the behavior of individual scientists (i. e., career aging) or publishing differences between cohorts of researchers (i. e., cohort succession). I examine the publication records of an interdisciplinary sample of university scientists and find evidence of both career-aging and cohort-succession processes, although cohort differences are much more pronounced than individual changes. Specifically, scientists in this sample increased the percentage of their articles with coauthors by 0. 63 percentage points annually. However, compared to those who received their PhDs between 1953 and 1962, scientists who entered the workforce between 1983 and 1991 coauthored approximately one third more of their early career articles (35. 63 percentage points). Additionally, career-aging processes in coauthorship varied by PhD cohort, with earlier trained researchers increasing more rapidly. Overall, this article highlights cohort succession as a source of change in coauthorship, and underscores the importance of accounting for <b>generational</b> differences in <b>studies</b> of scientific careers...|$|R
40|$|We extend recent {{critiques of}} {{research}} on generations in the work context by proposing a differentiated lifespan developmental perspective. We accomplish this through several means: First, we define generations and trace {{the historical development of}} this concept from sociological thought experiments to their contemporary (mis) use for understanding individual-level psychological processes at work. Second, we review core principles of the lifespan developmental perspective, with an emphasis on contextual-dialectical models of human development. Third, we argue that generations are better understood from a contextualized lifespan framework that accounts for time period and history-graded developmental influences that may impact individuals’ attitudes, values, beliefs, motives, and behavior at work. Fourth, we propose a new lifespan model of generations and offer several associated propositions to serve as a theoretical guide as well as an agenda for future research. Finally, we review and critique methodologies typically used to <b>study</b> <b>generational</b> effects, outline methodological recommendations to guide future studies, and offer practical recommendations based on our model. Overall, this article contributes to better theorizing and more rigorous research and practice regarding the idea of generations at work...|$|R
