500|$|In June 2001, Deep Ocean Expeditions, {{partnered with}} Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, {{conducted}} another {{investigation of the}} wreck. The researchers used Russian-built mini-subs. William N. Lange, a Woods Hole expert, stated, [...] "You see {{a large number of}} shell holes in the superstructure and deck, but not that many along the side, and none below the waterline." [...] The expedition found no penetrations in the main armoured belt, above or below the waterline. The examiners noted several long <b>gashes</b> <b>in</b> the hull, but attributed these to impact on the sea floor.|$|E

60|$|It {{was just}} twelve o'clock now and, in five minutes, {{there was a}} roar of cannon along the whole length of both lines. For half an hour the combat {{continued}} a mere artillery duel. The shells fell in all directions; cutting the dry branches from the trees, tearing up the ground, and leaving deep black <b>gashes</b> <b>in</b> the white snow; crashing through a wall or, occasionally, exploding among the troops.|$|E

60|$|Brooke {{laid down}} the letter, and took up the lawyers' schedule. Then he laughed curiously as he {{realized}} that a considerable proportion of his legacy was represented by shares in the Dayspring Consols. One of the mines, he knew, was liable to be jumped at any moment, {{and the other was}} worthless, unless the opinion of his half-crazy companion could be taken seriously. There were one or two more small <b>gashes</b> <b>in</b> the hillside, concerning which the miners he had questioned appeared distinctly dubious.|$|E
60|$|After a time {{he stopped}} to look about. His view {{commanded}} a horizon {{of two or three}} miles, for he seemed to be {{near the center of the}} tableland. Its surface was broken by the hummocks and hollows of the peat, and tufts of white wild cotton relieved the blackness of the <b>gashes</b> <b>in</b> the soil. Sheep fed in the distance, and he heard the harsh cry of a grouse that skimmed the heath. The skyline was clear, and by and by two sharp but distant figures cut against it.|$|E

60|$|He {{came to a}} standstill. At close {{quarters}} his appearance was even more terrible. Although by some means he had gotten into his evening clothes, he was only partly shaven, and there were <b>gashes</b> <b>in</b> his face where the hand which had held his razor had slipped. The pupils of his eyes were distended, and the eyes themselves seemed to have shrunk back into their sockets. His whole frame seemed to have suddenly lost vigour, even substance. He had {{the air of a}} man in clothes too large for him. Even his voice was shriller,--shriller and horrible with the slow and bestial satisfaction of his words.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't let us waste {{more time}} talking about it, boys.--Hold it up, Peterkin. There, lay the hind leg on this block of wood--so;" [...] and he cut it off; with {{a large portion of}} the haunch, at a single blow of the axe. [...] "Now the other--that's it." [...] And having thus cut off the two hind legs, he made several deep <b>gashes</b> <b>in</b> them, thrust a sharp-pointed stick through each, and stuck them up before the blaze to roast. The wood-pigeon was then split open, quite flat, washed clean in salt water, and treated in a similar manner. While these were cooking we scraped a hole in the sand and ashes under the fire, into which we put our {{vegetables}} and covered them up.|$|E
60|$|If {{we are so}} {{fortunate}} as to get sight of him, {{we will find that}} he is no easy game to bag. Very different is he from his tame brethren with which we are acquainted--old grunters, who wallow about the mud-puddles and sleep serenely for hours, with their fat sides baking in the sun. The wild boar is as fast as a horse, and as savage as the crossest bull. He can run so that you can scarcely catch up to him with your nag {{at the top of his}} speed, and when you do reach him he will be very apt, if you are not watchful, to rip up your horse with his tusks and cut some terrible <b>gashes</b> <b>in</b> your own legs, besides.|$|E

60|$|Under his {{direction}} I cut such <b>gashes</b> <b>in</b> {{the sides of}} the trees as would ensure that it should fall as we desired. It had already a strong, natural tilt {{in the direction of the}} plateau, so that the matter was not difficult. Finally I set to work in earnest upon the trunk, taking turn and turn with Lord John. In a little over an hour there was a loud crack, the tree swayed forward, and then crashed over, burying its branches among the bushes on the farther side. The severed trunk rolled to the very edge of our platform, and for one terrible second we all thought it was over. It balanced itself, however, a few inches from the edge, and there was our bridge to the unknown.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} morning Mr. Goodenough and Frank {{were called to}} the door by the noise of a passing crowd, and to their horror saw a man being taken to sacrifice. He was preceded by men beating drums, his hands were pinioned behind him. A sharp thin knife was passed through his cheeks, to which his lips were noozed like the figure 8. One ear was cut off and carried before him, the other hung to his head by {{a small piece of}} skin. There were several <b>gashes</b> <b>in</b> his back, and a knife was thrust under each shoulder blade. He was led by a cord passed through a hole bored in his nose. Frank ran horror stricken back into the house, and sat for a while with his hand over his eyes as if to shut out the ghastly spectacle.|$|E
60|$|In the meanwhile, it {{was growing}} darker, {{and she could}} not quite see what the dim figures across the river were doing. They did not, in fact, appear to be doing {{anything}} in particular, beyond standing in a group, while the rope no longer oscillated. A thin, white mist commenced to drift out of the hollow in filmy wisps, and, in a curious fashion, suggested the vast depth of it. The silence the roar of the river broke through grew more intense as the chill of the distant snow descended, and the stately pines seemed to grow older and greater of girth. They dwarfed the tiny clustering figures into insignificance, and as iron columns and the raw <b>gashes</b> <b>in</b> the side of the gully faded into the gathering night, it seemed to Barbara that here in her primeval fastnesses Nature ignored man's puny handiwork.|$|E

60|$|They {{succeeded in}} getting some {{distance}} above the canoes without being discovered, and were crossing the river to post themselves on the side along which the white men were coasting, when they were fortunately descried. Mr. Stuart and his companions were immediately on the alert. As they drew near {{to the place where}} the savages had crossed, they observed them posted among steep and overhanging rocks, close along which, the canoes would have to pass. Finding that the enemy had the advantage of the ground, the whites stopped short when within five hundred yards of them, and discharged and reloaded their pieces. They then made a fire, and dressed the wounds of Mr. Reed, who had received five severe <b>gashes</b> <b>in</b> the head. This being done, they lashed the canoes together, fastened them to a rock at a small distance from the shore, and there awaited the menaced attack.|$|E
6000|$|... "And in {{token of}} amity I here tear up and burn all the feuds of Adlerstein," [...] said Schlangenwald, {{producing}} from his pouch {{a collection of}} hostile literature, beginning from a crumpled strip of yellow parchment and ending with a coarse paper missive in the clerkly hand of burgher-bred Hugh Sorel, and bearing the crooked signatures {{of the last two}} Eberhards of Adlerstein--all with great seals of the eagle shield appended to them. A similar collection-- which, with one or two other family defiances, and the letters of investiture recently obtained at Ulm, formed the whole archives of Adlerstein--had been prepared within Ebbo's reach; and each of the two, taking up a dagger, made extensive <b>gashes</b> <b>in</b> these documents, and then--with no mercy to the future antiquaries, who would have gloated over them--the whole were hurled into the flames on the hearth, where the odour they emitted, if not grateful to the physical sense, should have been highly agreeable to the moral.|$|E
60|$|It was {{not only}} of his late {{disappointment}} that he was thinking, but of his whole past life. He was conscious of his hobbledehoyhood,--of that backwardness on his part in assuming manhood which had rendered him incapable of making himself acceptable to Lily before she {{had fallen into the}} clutches of Crosbie. As he thought of this he declared to himself that if he could meet Crosbie again he would again thrash him,--that he would so belabour him as to send him out of the world, if such sending might possibly be done by fair beating, regardless whether he himself might be called upon to follow him. Was it not hard that for the two of them,--for Lily and for him also,--there should be such punishment because of the insincerity of that man? When he had thus stood upon the bridge for some quarter of an hour, he took out his knife, and, with deep rough <b>gashes</b> <b>in</b> the wood, cut out Lily's name from the rail.|$|E
