5|$|Evidence for grapheme-color synesthesia comes {{also from}} the finding that colors can be <b>flexibly</b> {{associated}} to graphemes, as new meanings become assigned to those graphemes. In one study synesthetes were presented with Glagolitic letters that they have never seen before, and the meaning was acquired through a short writing exercise. The Glagolitic graphemes inherited {{the colors of the}} corresponding Latin graphemes as soon as the Glagolitic graphemes acquired the new meaning.|$|E
5|$|The mantis thorax {{consists}} of a prothorax, a mesothorax, and a metathorax. In all species apart from the genus Mantoida, the prothorax, which bears the head and forelegs, is much longer {{than the other two}} thoracic segments. The prothorax is also <b>flexibly</b> articulated, allowing {{for a wide range of}} movements of the head and fore limbs while the remainder of the body remains more or less immobile.|$|E
5|$|On {{the facts}} of Lines International, the judge held that the policy {{satisfied}} all four conditions and that {{the adoption of the}} guidelines was valid. On the fourth consideration relating to fettering of discretion, the judge found that the PSA and STPB had not rigidly enforced the guidelines as they had made it clear at the meeting attended by the plaintiff that they would consider representations from cruise operators, and, in fact, a number of such concessions were made. Hence, the guidelines had been <b>flexibly</b> applied and the PSA had not fettered its discretion by rigidly adhering to a policy. The Lines International conditions were approved by the Court of Appeal in JD Ltd. v. Comptroller of Income Tax (2005).|$|E
5|$|The thorax is {{segmented}} {{into the}} two discernible parts, the pro- and pterothorax. The pterothorax is the fused meso- and metathorax, which are commonly separated in other insect species, although <b>flexibly</b> articulate from the prothorax. When viewed from below, the thorax {{is that part}} from which all three pairs of legs and both pairs of wings arise. The abdomen is everything posterior to the thorax. When viewed from above, most beetles appear to have three clear sections, but this is deceptive: on the beetle's upper surface, the middle section is a hard plate called the pronotum, which is only the front part of the thorax; the back part of the thorax is concealed by the beetle's wings. This further segmentation is usually best seen on the abdomen.|$|E
5|$|Although {{they did}} not fix their {{schedules}} to the clock in the modern sense, ancient civilizations adjusted daily schedules to the sun more <b>flexibly</b> than DST does, often dividing daylight into twelve hours regardless of daytime, so that each daylight hour was longer during summer. For example, the Romans kept time with water clocks that had different scales for different months of the year: at Rome's latitude the third hour from sunrise, hora tertia, started by modern standards at 09:02 solar time and lasted 44 minutes at the winter solstice, but at the summer solstice it started at 06:58 and lasted 75 minutes. After ancient times, equal-length civil hours eventually supplanted unequal, so civil time no longer varies by season. Unequal hours are still used in a few traditional settings, such as some monasteries of Mount Athos and all Jewish ceremonies.|$|E
5|$|Researchers {{have argued}} that {{cognitive}} flexibility is also a component of multiple classification, as originally described by psychologist Jean Piaget. In multiple classification tasks, participants (primarily children, who have already developed or {{are in the process}} of developing this skill) must classify objects in several different ways at once - thereby thinking <b>flexibly</b> about them. Similarly, in order to be cognitively flexible they must overcome centration, which is the tendency for young children to solely focus on one aspect of an object or situation. For example, when children are young they may be solely able to focus on one aspect of an object (i.e. color of object), and be unable to focus on both aspects (i.e. both color and kind of object). Thus, research suggests if an individual is centrated in their thinking, then they will be more cognitively inflexible.|$|E
5|$|The costa (C) is {{the leading}} {{marginal}} vein on most insects, although sometimes {{there is a small}} vein above the costa called the precosta, although in almost all extant insects, the precosta is fused with the costa; The costa rarely ever branches because it is at the leading edge, which is associated at its base with the humeral plate. The trachea of the costal vein is perhaps a branch of the subcostal trachea. Located after the costa is the third vein, the subcosta, which branches into two separate veins: the anterior and posterior. The base of the subcosta is associated with the distal end of the neck of the first axillary (see section below). The fourth vein is the radius (R), which is branched into five separate veins. The radius is generally the strongest vein of the wing. Toward the middle of the wing, it forks into a first undivided branch (R1) and a second branch, called the radial sector (Ra), which subdivides dichotomously into four distal branches (R2, R3, R4, R5). Basally, the radius is <b>flexibly</b> united with the anterior end of the second axillary (2Ax).|$|E
5|$|The first {{axillary}} sclerite (lAx) is {{the anterior}} hinge plate {{of the wing}} base. Its anterior part is supported on the anterior notal wing process of the tergum (ANP); its posterior part articulates with the tergal margin. The anterior end of the sclerite is generally produced as a slender arm, the apex of which (e) is always associated with {{the base of the}} subcostal vein (Sc), though it is not united with the latter. The body of the sclerite articulates laterally with the second axillary. The second axillary sclerite (2Ax) is more variable in form than the first axillary, but its mechanical relations are no less definite. It is obliquely hinged to the outer margin of the body of the first axillary, and the radial vein (R) is always <b>flexibly</b> attached to its anterior end (d). The second axillary presents both a dorsal and a ventral sclerotization in the wing base; its ventral surface rests upon the fulcral wing process of the pleuron. The second axillary, therefore, is the pivotal sclerite of the wing base, and it specifically manipulates the radial vein.|$|E

25|$|These {{rules were}} {{sometimes}} interpreted <b>flexibly</b> {{and were more}} formally relaxed from 1997 when records descending the charts were featured more regularly, possibly {{as a response to}} the changing nature of the Top 40 (in the late 1990s and early 2000s climbers in the charts were a rarity, with almost all singles peaking at their debut position).|$|E
25|$|Shostakovich {{admitted}} Rimsky-Korsakov's orchestration {{was more}} colorful {{than his own}} and used brighter timbres. However, he also felt that Rimsky-Korsakov chopped up the melodic lines too much and, by blending melody and subvoices, may have subverted much of Mussorgsky's intent. Shostakovich also felt that Rimsky-Korsakov {{did not use the}} orchestra <b>flexibly</b> enough to follow the characters' mood changes, instead making the orchestra calmer, more balanced.|$|E

25|$|From about 1450, {{with the}} arrival in Italy of the Flemish painter Rogier van der Weyden and {{possibly}} earlier, artists {{were introduced to the}} medium of oil paint. Whereas both tempera and fresco lent themselves to the depiction of pattern, neither presented a successful way to represent natural textures realistically.

This was demonstrated with a variety of cabins that were observation platforms and VIP rooms and one cabin at ground level that became an information booth.|$|E
25|$|Baley {{furthermore}} {{proposes that}} the Solarians {{may one day}} use robots for military purposes. If a spacecraft was built with a positronic brain and carried neither humans nor the life-support systems to sustain them, then the ship's robotic intelligence could naturally assume that all other spacecraft were robotic beings. Such a ship could operate more responsively and <b>flexibly</b> than one crewed by humans, could be armed more heavily and its robotic brain equipped to slaughter humans of whose existence it is totally ignorant. This possibility is referenced in Foundation and Earth where it is discovered that the Solarians possess a strong police force of unspecified size that has been programmed to identify only the Solarian race as human.|$|E
25|$|The airline {{received}} a concession on 12 February 1976 {{to operate a}} taxi route connecting Haugesund to Bergen Airport, Flesland and Stavanger Airport, Sola. This {{had the advantage of}} the airline being allowed to operate more <b>flexibly</b> and could cancel flights with few passengers. On the other hand, it could only operate aircraft with up to ten passengers. The routes commenced on 5 March 1977 with three daily flights to Bergen and two to Stavanger. The regular concession for the route was granted to Braathens SAFE, but they chose not to execute it, allowing for a smaller airline to operate an interim service. For these route as well as charter the airline bought a Beechcraft 99 Queenliner and a Britten-Norman Islander.|$|E
25|$|The {{empty space}} between the pubic bones and the {{intestines}} has by G.S. Paul and David Martill been hypothesised {{to have been the}} location of a large air-sac. Dal Sasso & Maganuco however, rejected this interpretation because with living birds the air-sac of the posterior abdomen does not force the intestines forwards. They considered the space {{more likely to have been}} filled by a large yolk-sac. Air-sacs were nevertheless probable given the pneumatisation of the vertebrae. Vertebrae without pneumatopores would have indicated the boundaries between three air-sac systems: those of the neck base, the lungs, and the abdomen. The double rib heads would indicate a rather stiff thorax, ventilated by the gastralia. A system of hook-like uncinate processes on the ribs as with the Maniraptoriformes, allowing the ribcage to move <b>flexibly,</b> in articulation with an ossified sternum, was absent in Scipionyx.|$|E
25|$|Norwegian {{contributions}} to international crisis management have been generated from {{a system that}} is first and foremost geared towards the rapid activation of mobilization units armed and trained for territorial defence. As a consequence, Norwegian {{contributions to}} international military operations have a high degree of sustainability, as they have a substantial number of reserve units on which to draw. However, without adaptation this force posture is to a lesser extent able to generate forces rapidly and <b>flexibly</b> in response to international crises. Moreover, the contributions that Norway has been able to make to international operations have tended to consist of lightly armoured mechanized infantry, well-suited for more traditional peacekeeping tasks (UNIFIL in southern Lebanon to which Norway contributed a sizable unit for over twenty years) but not sufficiently robust for missions which might entail enforcement tasks.|$|E
25|$|Tange {{organised}} {{the spaces}} of the three firms by function {{to allow them to}} share common facilities. He stacked these functions vertically according to need, for example, the printing plant is on the ground floor to facilitate access to the street for loading and transportation. He then took all the service functions including elevators, toilets and pipes and grouped them into 16 reinforced concrete cylindrical towers, each with an equal 5 metre diameter. These he placed on a grid into which he inserted the functional group facilities and offices. These inserted elements were conceived of as containers that were independent of the structure and could be arranged <b>flexibly</b> as required. This conceived flexibility distinguished Tange's design from other architects' designs with open floor offices and service cores – such as Kahn's Richards Medical Research Laboratories. Tange deliberately finished the cylindrical towers at different heights to imply that there was room for vertical expansion.|$|E
25|$|Like other decapod crustaceans, the {{crayfish}} {{possesses a}} hard, segmented exoskeleton that reflects muscular and neural segmentation. The anterior {{portion of the}} crayfish is the cephalothorax region. The region rostral to the cephalic grove, which separates the head and thorax region, {{is characterized by the}} presence of eyes, antennae and claws while the region caudal contains four pairs of walking legs. This is the crayfish's primary mode of locomotion. The abdominal section of the crayfish is divided into seven segments. These segments are <b>flexibly</b> interconnected, forming the tail. Normally, the tail is held in an extended position to aid in maneuvering and balancing. The first five segments are similar and the two terminal segments are modified into a tail fan, a region with high surface area that acts as the blade of a paddle in the escape response. This region contains the telson. The abdominal segments contain swimmerets, which aid in swimming.|$|E

25|$|In the 1969–72 cycle Fischer caused {{two more}} crises. He refused {{to play in}} the 1969 US Championship, which was a Zonal Tournament.

FIDE President Max Euwe accepted this maneuver and interpreted the rules very <b>flexibly</b> to enable Fischer to play, as he thought it important for the health and reputation of the game that Fischer should have the opportunity to challenge for the title as soon as possible. Fischer crushed all opposition and won the right to challenge reigning champion Boris Spassky. After agreeing to play in Yugoslavia, Fischer raised a series of objections and Iceland was the final venue. Even then Fischer raised difficulties, mainly over money. It took a phone call from United States Secretary of State Henry Kissinger and a doubling of the prize money by financier Jim Slater to persuade him to play. After a few more traumatic moments Fischer won the match 12½–8½.|$|E
25|$|The Handle System {{ensures that}} the DOI name for an object {{is not based on}} any {{changeable}} attributes of the object such as its physical location or ownership, that the attributes of the object are encoded in its metadata rather than in its DOI name, and that no two objects are assigned the same DOI name. Because DOI names are short character strings, they are human-readable, may be copied and pasted as text, and fit into the URI specification. The DOI name-resolution mechanism acts behind the scenes, so that users communicate with it {{in the same way as}} with any other web service; it is built on open architectures, incorporates trust mechanisms, and is engineered to operate reliably and <b>flexibly</b> so that it can be adapted to changing demands and new applications of the DOI system. DOI name-resolution may be used with OpenURL to select the most appropriate among multiple locations for a given object, according to the location of the user making the request. However, despite this ability, the DOI system has drawn criticism from librarians for directing users to non-free copies of documents that would have been available for no additional fee from alternative locations.|$|E
25|$|Physical {{activity}} is body movement that works your muscles and requires {{more energy than}} resting. According to a blog by the American Intercontinental University, college students should make time for exercise to maintain and increase motivation. AIU states that regular exercise has impeccable effects on the brain. With consistent running routines, there are more complex connections between neurons, meaning the brain is able to access its brain cells more <b>flexibly.</b> By performing well physically, motivation will be present in education because of how well the brain is performing. After exercising, the brain can have more desire to obtain knowledge and better retain the information. In addition, exercise can relieve stress. Exercising can ease anxiety and relieve negative effects of stress on the body. Without stress factors, individuals can perform better and more efficiently, since their minds will have a more positive outlook. This positive mood will help keep students motivated and more open and willing to succeed academically. Lastly, exercise increases focus and concentration that could also help students maintain their motivation and focus on their studies. AIU claims that exercise may have improved the students' ability to participate and retain information during the class after they had exercised. Being able to retain information and being willing to participate keeps students motivated and performing well academically.|$|E
25|$|His drawing {{style was}} simple yet bold. It {{captured}} aspects of youth that were innocent and carefree. They reflected the wishful or nostalgic sentiment of the time. Martin excluded the non-essential details (extra people, structures, trees, scenery etc.), which allowed viewers {{to make an}} instant connection. His paintings were often easy to recognize, since their theme and style remained fairly consistent. They sometimes gave the illusion of three-dimensional depth. This was {{through the use of}} various techniques, such as overlapping, color intensity or variation and linear perspective. His cover art never corresponded to anything in particular, but rather had a holiday or seasonal theme or portrayed the magazine's overall image (common practice back then). Martin mostly hired local boys for the photo sessions. His drawings were made directly from those photos, and not real life (which required long sittings). This gave him more options and <b>flexibly,</b> as the final version was based on multiple photos taken during the shoot (along with some improvising). It was also a more practical process, due to active children being involved. He would interact with them, until getting the desired natural or candid expression. His wife assisted in preparing the models for their scenes. Collier's couldn't keep up with the rapidly changing times following WWII, and ceased publication in December 1956.

500|$|According to the CTW's research, {{children}} preferred {{watching and}} listening to other children more than to puppets and adults, so they included children in many scenes. Dave Connell insisted that no child actors be used, so these children were nonprofessionals, unscripted, and spontaneous. Many of their reactions were unpredictable and difficult to control, but the adult cast learned to handle the children's spontaneity <b>flexibly,</b> even when it resulted in departures from the planned script or lesson. CTW research also revealed that the children's hesitations and on-air mistakes served as models for viewers. According to Morrow, this resulted in the show having a [...] "fresh quality", especially in its early years.
