40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was made of}} the performance of nine conical cooling-air ejectors at primary jet pressure ratios from 1 to 10, secondary pressure ratios to 4. 0, and a temperature ratio of unity. This phase of the {{investigation was}} limited to conical <b>ejectors</b> having <b>shroud</b> exit to primary nozzle exit diameter ratios of 1. 06 and 1. 40, with several spacing ratios for each. The experimental results indicated that the pumping range and amount of cooling-air flow obtained with a 1. 06 diameter ratio ejector were relatively small for cooling purposes but that the maximum possible thrust loss, which occurred with no secondary flow, was only 7 percent of convergent nozzle thrust. The 1. 40 diameter ratio ejector produced a large cooling air flow and showed a possible thrust loss of 29. 5 percent with no cooling air flow. Thrust gains were attained with ejectors of both diameter ratios at secondary pressure ratios greater than 1. 0.

Noise suppression was achieved at nozzle pressure ratios of 2. 5 and greater. Maximum lobe jet noise attenuation of 15 db with thrust loss differences of 1. 5 percent compared to the convergent nozzle were obtained at a nozzle pressure ratio of 3. 5 with an <b>ejector</b> <b>shroud</b> two nozzle diameters long. Without the ejector the attenuation was 13 db with thrust loss differences of 11 percent.

40|$|A {{method was}} {{developed}} for calculating the static performance of thrust augmenting ejectors by matching a viscous solution for the flow through the ejector to an inviscid solution for the flow outside the ejector. A two dimensional analysis utilizing a turbulence kinetic energy model {{is used to calculate}} the rate of entrainment by the jets. Vortex panel methods are then used with the requirement that the <b>ejector</b> <b>shroud</b> must be a streamline of the flow induced by the jets to determine the strength of circulation generated around the shroud. In effect, the <b>ejector</b> <b>shroud</b> is considered to be flying in the velocity field of the jets. The solution is converged by iterating between the rate of entrainment and the strength of the circulation. This approach offers the advantage of including external influences on the flow through the ejector. Comparisons with data are presented for an ejector having a single central nozzle and Coanda jet on the walls. The accuracy of the matched solution is found to be especially sensitive to the jet flap effect of the flow just downstream of the ejector exit...|$|E

Predictions of this new theory are compared with the results of classical methods of calculating the augmentation by integration of the stream thrust...|$|E
40|$|In {{the design}} of a jet engine exhaust nozzle for {{civilian}} supersonic cruise vehicles, it is necessary to consider both the supersonic cruise efficiency and the noise generated during terminal area operations. The convergent-divergent geometry necessary for cruise efficiency, will separate when operated at the lower nozzle pressure ratios associated with take-off and initial climb, causing unacceptable noise levels. One proposed solution is to comprise the divergent geometry of two rotatable clamshell bodies. These clamshell components would be rotated open during low nozzle pressure ratio operation, to effectively eliminate the divergent geometry and effect a subsonic ejector nozzle. These clamshells have the added benefit of functioning as thrust reversers and eliminating the need for a separate such system. This work, in general, investigates the effectiveness of a preliminary clamshell ejector design. Specifically, a seven-hole probe mounted on an automated, 2 -axis traverse is used to collect wake survey data in the exhaust plume of the test nozzle in several configurations. This survey data is used to create velocity profiles of the jet plume and calculate thrust coefficients. In addition, several flow visualization techniques are utilized to further explore the flow structure near the geometry surface. Results indicate that the mixing layer between the primary and secondary streams is failing to attach to the <b>ejector</b> <b>shroud,</b> leading to separation and recirculation near the internal <b>ejector</b> <b>shroud</b> surfaces. Separation in these areas is causing streamwise vortices to be shed from the ejector surfaces. Thrust calculations indicate that the ejector configuration provides significant performance benefits reletive to the convergent-divergent cruise geometry, but is causing negative thrust augmentation. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{considering}} {{propulsion systems}} for future supersonic civil transport, {{it is important}} to consider all design conditions for a given system. Not only does the design need to accomplish goals for cruise efficiency, but it also needs to perform in off-design conditions. The typical converging-diverging nozzle design for supersonic flight encounters significant performance issues when operating in the low nozzle pressure ratio regime associated with takeoff, landing, and loiter. The massive separation that occurs during this regime leads to unacceptable noise levels and a significant decline in nozzle performance. As a proposed solution to this problem, a converging-diverging nozzle with rotatable clamshells was implemented and tested in previous investigations. The proposed nozzle incorporated added benefits from its ejector design that provided the possibility for increased thrust, and noise benefits due to flow entrainment and enhanced mixing. As demonstrated in the previous investigations, the ejector nozzle suffered from lower than expected performance. It was determined that reversed flow and separation caused by the failure of the free-mixing layer to attach to the <b>ejector</b> <b>shroud</b> was the root cause of the performance issues. In combating these issues, this investigation explores the addition of forced mixing techniques in order to improve the nozzle performance. Triangular mixing tabs were added to the nozzle throat in order to generate enhanced mixing by means of streamwise vortices formed from the tab geometry. A series of plume velocity surveys were performed in order to determine the effectiveness of the forced mixing mechanisms, and along with flow visualizations, a determination on the mixing tab performance was formed. Results indicated that the shear layer is now attached to the clamshell surface and the separation inside the ejector has primarily disappeared. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{aerospace}} industry is currently investigating {{the effect of}} installing mixer/ejector nozzles on the core flow exhaust of high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines. This effort includes both full-scale engine tests at sea level conditions and subscale tests in static test facilities. Subscale model tests are to be conducted prior to full-scale testing. With this approach, model results can be analyzed and compared with analytical predications. Problem areas can then be identified and design changes made and verified in subscale prior to committing to any final design configurations for engine ground tests. One of the subscale model test programs for the integrated mixer/ejector development was a joint test conducted by the NASA Lewis Research Center and Pratt & Whitney Aircraft. This test was conducted to study various mixer/ejector nozzle configurations installed on the core flow exhaust of advanced, high-bypass-ratio turbofan engines for subsonic, commercial applications. The mixer/ejector concept involves the introduction of largescale, low-loss, streamwise vortices that entrain large amounts of secondary air and rapidly mix it with the primary stream. This results in increased ejector pumping relative to conventional ejectors and in more complete mixing within the <b>ejector</b> <b>shroud.</b> The latter improves thrust performance through the efficient energy exchange between the primary and secondary streams. This experimental program was completed in April 1997 in Lewis' CE- 22 static test facility. Variables tested included the nozzle area ratio (A 9 /A 8), which ranged from 1. 6 to 3. 0. This ratio was varied by increasing or decreasing the nozzle throat area, A 8. Primary nozzles tested included both lobed mixers and conical primaries. These configurations were tested with and without an outer shroud, and the shroud position was varied by inserting spacers in it. In addition, data were acquired with and without secondary flow...|$|E
