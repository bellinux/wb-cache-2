5|$|The {{black mamba}} is {{primarily}} terrestrial, but occasionally arboreal, especially where {{it occurs in}} forest. Typically it inhabits neglected areas of scrub, termite mounds, abandoned burrows and rock crevices. It <b>is</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> terrain ranging from savannah and woodland to rocky slopes and dense forests. The black mamba prefers moderately dry environments such as light woodland and scrub, rocky outcrops, and semi-arid dry savannah, to dense forest or arid desert.|$|E
5|$|The family Hirundinidae <b>is</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> aerial feeding. They have {{a slender}} {{streamlined}} body, long pointed wings {{and a short}} bill with a wide gape.

50|$|Mangroves are salt {{tolerant}} trees, also called halophytes, and <b>are</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> life in harsh coastal conditions.

5|$|All baleen {{whales are}} carnivorous; however a 2015 study {{revealed}} they house gut flora {{similar to that}} of terrestrial herbivores. Different kinds of prey are found in different abundances depending on location, and each type of whale <b>is</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> a specialized way of foraging. There are two types of feeding behaviors: skim-feeding and lunge-feeding, but some species do both depending on the type and amount of food. For example, Antarctic whales mostly feed on euphausiids; however, this is mainly effective for lunge-feeders, whereas skim-feeders, like the right whales, feed primarily on copepods. They feed alone or in small groups. Baleen whales get the water they need from their food, and their kidneys excrete excess salt.|$|E
5|$|Amargasaurus was quadrupedal (moved on four legs), and {{probably}} {{was unable to}} rear on its hind legs. Salgado and Bonaparte (1991) suggested that Amargasaurus was a slow walker, as both the forearms and lower legs were proportionally short, as a feature common to slow-moving animals. This was contradicted by Gerardo Mazzetta and Richard Fariña (1999), who argued that Amargasaurus was capable of rapid locomotion. During locomotion, leg bones are strongly affected by bending moments, representing a limiting factor for the maximum speed of an animal. The leg bones of Amargasaurus were even more sturdy than those of today's white rhinoceros, which <b>is</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> galloping.|$|E
50|$|It {{might have}} no effect, {{due to the}} {{dominance}} of present life on Earth and because it would not <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> infect human or DNA-based life. The contrary, worst-case argument is {{that we would not}} <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to resist it, and that alien life would not <b>be</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> have no harmful effects (pathogens are most lethal when they first migrate to a new host). Also some diseases can leap directly to an animal host, such as Legionnaire's disease, jumped straight to humans, previously a disease of amoeba.|$|R

5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its host on or in which it <b>is</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different host species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate host is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final host is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E
5|$|Found in dry sclerophyll {{forest on}} sandstone-based nutrient-deficient soils, P.linearis <b>is</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> a fire-prone environment; the plants resprout epicormic buds from beneath their thick bark after bushfires. The fruit are {{consumed}} by vertebrates such as kangaroo, possums and currawongs. As {{with other members}} of the genus, P.linearis is rare in cultivation as it is very hard to propagate, either by seed or cuttings. It adapts readily to cultivation, preferring acidic soils with good drainage and at least a partly sunny aspect.|$|E
5|$|In {{the central}} Volcanic Plateau, cabbage trees are tall, with stout, {{relatively}} unbranched stems and large stiff straight leaves. Fine specimens are found along the upper Whanganui River. On old trees, the leaves {{tend to be}} relatively broad. The leaves radiate strongly, suggesting that tī manu <b>is</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> the cold winters of the upland central plateau. It may have originated in the open country created by lava, volcanic ash, and pumice. Trees of the tī manu type are also found in northern Taranaki, the King Country and the Bay of Plenty lowlands.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.attenuata <b>is</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> {{an environment in}} which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. Bearing epicormic buds and a lignotuber, B.attenuata is one of the latter group, with follicles that may open spontaneously or by fire.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, B.oligantha <b>is</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> {{an environment in}} which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.oligantha is a reseeder; it has thin bark, and lacks a lignotuber, so it is killed by fire. However, the species is weakly serotinous: fire triggers seed release, yet seed release still occurs in the absence of fire.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many plants}} in {{south-west}} Western Australia, Banksia caleyi <b>is</b> <b>adapted</b> <b>to</b> {{an environment in}} which bushfire events are relatively frequent. Most Banksia species can be placed in one of two broad groups according to their response to fire: reseeders are killed by fire, but fire also triggers the release of their canopy seed bank, thus promoting recruitment of the next generation; resprouters survive fire, resprouting from a lignotuber or, more rarely, epicormic buds protected by thick bark. B.caleyi belongs to the reseeder group. In the wild, seedlings take at least three to four years to reach flowering after bushfire. Non-patchy fires occurring at intervals of less than seven years may wipe out local populations of reseeders.|$|E
