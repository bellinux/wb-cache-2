It is a quick and convenient method of measuring the size of a deviation and is generally used in association with a number of other tests before a full diagnosis is determined.|$|R
40|$|Patients are {{frequently}} seen who show <b>heterotropias</b> on gaze in opposite directions, {{such as an}} esotropia on looking right and an exotropia on looking left, or a right hypertropia on looking up and a left hypertropia on looking down. These antipodal deviations may occur naturally as a congenital derangement, or may develop {{as a result of}} surgery or trauma (Urist, I 964). Fortunately, in most cases, they balance one another so that the eyes become straight, that is, vertically and horizontally aligned, in some neutral position of gaze. Because of this balancing tendency and the ability to develop straight eyes, I call them "neutralizing pattern deviations". More than half of about 4, 000 cases of strabismus examined over the past 20 years have had at least one type of neutralizing pattern deviation. To mv knowledge there exists no comprehensive report on all types of neutralizing deviations, no classification, and no nomenclature for discussing them.

50|$|The cross-{{cover test}}, or {{alternating}} cover test is usually employed to detect heterophoria. One eye is covered, {{and then the}} cover is moved immediately {{over to the other}} eye. With heterophoria, when the cover is moved to the other eye, the eye that has just been uncovered can be seen to move from a deviated point. The difference between <b>heterotropia</b> and heterophoria can be easily understood as follows. With <b>heterotropia,</b> a correcting movement of the eye can be detected already by the simple cover test; with heterophoria, such correcting movement only takes place in the cross-cover test. The reason is that subjects with heterophoria are able to create and maintain binocular fusion through vergence, and the cross-cover test purposely breaks this fusion, making the latent misaligment visible.|$|E
50|$|Ensure {{to assist}} the patient in {{maintaining}} fixation on accommodative or distance targets at all times- if testing on children or adults, request specific details pertaining to the accommodative target (to assure accommodation is utilized) for near testing. Use of a detailed target for near fixation in both adults and children will identify the effects of accommodation on the deviation. Observing pupillary constriction should also be indicative of accommodation.Cover-Uncover testing and alternate cover testing should be performed on the deviating eye even when a constant <b>heterotropia</b> is observed. This practice ensures the detection of a consistent increase in deviation and DVD isn’t neglected.|$|E
50|$|Strabismus can be {{manifest}} (-tropia) or latent (-phoria). A manifest deviation, or <b>heterotropia</b> (which may be eso-, exo-, hyper-, hypo-, cyclotropia or {{a combination}} of these), is present while the patient views a target binocularly, with no occlusion of either eye. The patient is unable to align the gaze of each eye to achieve fusion. A latent deviation, or heterophoria (eso-, exo-, hyper-, hypo-, cyclophoria {{or a combination}} of these), is only present after binocular vision has been interrupted, typically by covering one eye. This type of patient can typically maintain fusion despite the misalignment that occurs when the positioning system is relaxed. Intermittent strabismus is a combination of both of these types, where the patient can achieve fusion, but occasionally or frequently falters to the point of a manifest deviation.|$|E

5000|$|The method {{consists}} in a measurement of an alleged angular misalignment (referred to as associated phoria or hidden strabismus, also called [...] "" [...] in German language) {{that is different}} from <b>heterotropia</b> or heterophoria, and involves the use of prisms for its correction. In the MKH method, this alleged misalignment is assessed by the Polatest apparatus and subsequently the patient is instructed to use prism glasses in daily life to correct for the alleged misalignment, with the prism glasses made according to the Polatest results. The MKH method claims to reduce eye strain-related symptoms. It has found some application in German-speaking countries and claims to achieve unimpaired binocular vision, however it has received little scientific recognition and is not accepted by mainstream medical practice, neither internationally nor in Germany. The method does not appear to show better results than conventional spectacle prescriptions, and the practice of MKH has been criticized as contravening the rule to first do no harm. The German association of ophthalmologists ( [...] (BVA)) issued a statement warning that the use of the MKH method could in fact lead to use of prisms of increasing strength, ultimately requiring the patient to undergo strabismus surgery that would have otherwise been unnecessary.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND Dissociated Vertical Deviation (DVD) is {{a poorly}} {{understood}} supranuclear strabismic disorder {{in which there}} is slow upward and sometimes temporal movement of one eye with cortical suppression of vision in that eye when it is occluded. In DVD, one eye get dissociated from the fellow eye, so they don’t follow Hering's and Sherrington's laws of innervation. DVD is also a marker of disruption of normal binocular function, which causes unbalanced input to vestibular system resulting in latent nystagmus with a cyclovertical component. To overcome this cyclovertical component, vertical vergence is invoked for which vision is aided in the fixing eye, but unfortunately it also produces DVD of the fellow eye. DVD is most commonly associated with infantile esotropia. AIM  To determine whether age of onset of strabismus is related to the development of dissociated vertical deviation in patients with horizontal concomitant <b>heterotropia</b> (HCH). To find out the occurrence of dissociated vertical deviation among patients with horizontal concomitant <b>heterotropia</b> and also to calculate how many of them is suffering from refractive error.  DESIGN This is a cross-sectional, observational hospital-based study.

40|$|Syfte: Studiens syfte var att undersöka prevalensen av avståndsforier och avståndstropier bland hjälpsökande i Ghana under en resa med hjälporganisationen Vision For All. Metod: Vid behov utfördes en enkel binokulär refraktion för att finna den bästa sfäriska ekvivalenten. Med denna eventuella korrektion på utfördes covertest på 6 m avstånd. Om indikation på att en fori eller tropi var förekommande mättes denna upp med prismastav och prisma covertest. Resultatet jämfördes sedan med liknande prevalensstudier i andra länder. Resultat: Av de personerna som screenades ingick 153 personer i studien. Åldern varierade mellan 5 - 85 år, där medelåldern var 47 ± 19 år. Hos 134 personer (87, 6 %) hittades ingen inställningsrörelse och de noterades som ortofori. Hos resterande var 7, 8 % exofori, 0, 7 % esofori. Exotropi och esotropi var lika förekommande med 2, 0 % vardera. Medelvärdet var 0, 27 ± 1, 21 Δ exofori för hela gruppen, med tropierna borträknade. Vanligast förekommande var 2 Δ exofori. Enbart två utav de sex upptäckta tropierna kunde mätas upp, dessa var 6 Δ esotropi och 10 Δ esotropi. Slutsats: Det vanligaste binokulära tillståndet på avstånd var ortofori. Därefter var den vanligaste binokulära avvikelsen exofori. Vilket ligger i linje med tidigare studier. Förekomsten av tropi var något högre än medelvärdet hos de studier som jämförts med. Denna studie kan ses som en fingervisning om hur prevalensen av avståndstropier och avståndstropier ter sig i Ghana. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the prevalence of distance heterophoria and <b>heterotropia</b> in a sample population of Ghana who attended vision screening camps from the Swedish non-profit organization called Vision For All. Vision For All collects, cleans and measures old spectacles in Sweden. During organized trips to less privileged countries in the world they perform eye examinations and donate spectacles. At first a simple eye examination was performed to find the patients’ best binocular spherical equivalent. Then to determine if a distance phoria or tropia was present, the unilateral and alternating cover test were used. If a heterophoria or <b>heterotropia</b> was found the prism cover test was performed using a prism bar to determine the size. 153 people were included in the study, with an average age of 47 ± 19 years and ranging between 5 - 85 years. The study found that 87, 6 % were orthophoric at distance. 7, 8 % were exophoric and 0, 7 % were esophoric. Exo- and esotropia were 2, 0 % respectively. The average deviation size for the whole group was 0, 27 ± 1, 21 Δ exophoria, where 2 Δ exophoria was the most common. Only two of the six found tropias could be measured, they were 6 Δ esotropia and 10 Δ esotropia. Earlier studies confirm that the most common condition is no deviation at distance and that an exophoric state is the second most common condition. The presence of tropia in this study was more frequent than the mean of other studies presented in this paper. This study only shows a hint of how the prevalence of distance heterophoria and <b>heterotropia</b> is in Ghana.

A thorough orthoptic examination revealed a notable difference between the prism and alternate-cover test and the Hirschberg measurements. Results: The first patient exhibited a bilateral vertical angle kappa into opposite directions due to retinochoroidal scars. Two other patients presented with horizontal angle kappa deviations. In one patient a true accommodative esotropia was exaggerated by a right negative angle kappa. The other patient had a pseudoexotropia due to bilateral positive angle kappa.

We present a series of symptomatic patients with complicated GP who underwent pancreaticoduodenectomy, and review the diagnostic challenges, imaging modalities, pathological features and clinical outcome of this rare condition. Patients and methods. This was a prospective case base study of clinical, radiological and pathological data collected between the years 2000 and 2005 on patients diagnosed with severe GP – confirmed by histopathological examination following pancreaticoduodenectomy. Results. In total 11 patients were included, presenting with chronic abdominal pain (n= 11), gastric outlet obstruction (n= 5) and jaundice (n= 1).

Some of the causes for this failure of contact lens wear were analysed by Gerhard and Bronner (i 965), who found that the failure rate was independent of the type of contact lens fitted. In the patients who are unable to tolerate the contact lens because of irritation or who experience difficulty in its handling, it would be reasonable to expect that a more satis-factory long-term binocular visual result would be obtained by the use of an intraocular acrylic lens implant. Such an implant would have no advantage in patients intolerant of the lens because of <b>heterotropia</b> and, although the difference in retinal image size between the phakic and the correlated aphakic eye is reduced from an average of 6 - 99 per cent. with a contact lens to 1 - 92 per cent. with an intraocular lens (Girard, Friedman, Moore, Blau, Binkhorst, and Gobin, I 962), good binocular vision is usually achieved by either method.

40|$|Background: The ocular motor {{system is}} complex and {{dependent}} on the cooperation of many {{different areas of the}} brain. Ocular motor functions may be disturbed by various factors resulting in strabismus, and abnormal fixational behaviour, which may interfere on a multitude of visual functions. To study binocular functions orthoptic methods may be used and when studying visual fixation eye-trackers may be used. However, previous orthoptic studies often lack precise definitions, and studies of visual fixation behaviour in children are rare. In a multidisciplinary study of children with surgically treated hydrocephalus (HC), a variety of functions, including orthoptic functions were to be studied. Aim: The aim {{of this study was to}} obtain results of commonly used orthoptic tests and visual fixation behaviour in a sample of children, for use as comparison in studies of different patient groups, and to compare these results, with the same variables in a population based group of children with surgically treated HC. We also wished to study the effects of the onset and the aetiology of HC, associated neurological impairments and the ventricular width on orthoptic variables and visual fixation behavior. Materials and methods: Papers I and III: The comparison group consisted of children aged 4 − 15 years from different schools and pre-schools in the area of Göteborg. Papers II and IV: The HC group consisted of a population-based group of children aged 7 - 12 years, with surgically treated HC. All children in both groups were evaluated with the same test battery of orthoptic test commonly used in clinical practice. An infrared eye-tracker (Orbit) was used to evaluate visual fixation behaviour. Results: Paper I: In the comparison group, five children (3. 5 %) had <b>heterotropia,</b> and one child had abnormal ocular motility. Heterophoria was found in 37 children (26 %) and was four times more common at near than at distant fixation. The near point of convergence was ≤ 6 cm in 97 % of the children, and 97 % had stereo acuity of 60 ” or better. The results of the AC/A calculation with the methods used were regarded as unreliable in this age group. No anomalous head postures or nystagmus were observed. Paper II: <b>Heterotropia</b> (69 %), abnormal head posture (41 %), nystagmus (44 %), and motility abnormalities (60 %) were significantly more common in children with HC (p< 0. 001) than in the comparison group. Children with overt HC at birth had a significantly higher frequency of orthoptic abnormalities compared to children developing HC during the first year of life. Paper III: In the comparison group, both fixation time (p= 0. 02) and fixation density around the centre of gravity of fixation (p< 0. 01) increased with increasing age, while number of intruding saccades decreased (p< 0. 01) with increasing age. Blinks and drifts could not be shown to be age dependent. Paper IV: As a group children with HC had shorter fixation time (p< 0. 01) and higher frequency of drifts (p< 0. 01) than the comparison group. However, children with myelomeningocele (MMC), did not differ from the comparison group in these variables, while children with associated neurological impairments, were more affected than those without. Conclusion: We have obtained results from commonly used orthoptic tests and described the fixation behaviour in children. Children with HC have greatly increased risk for orthoptic abnormalities. Fixation stability improves with age in children in general. Children with HC with aetiologies other than MMC, a group with more associated neurological impairments, had more abnormal fixation behaviour than those with MMC. However, regarding orthoptic abnormalities children with MMC were equally affected indicating the vulnerability of the binocular system in children with HC...|$|E

Our aims were to establish the prevalence of distance associated HTF by measuring with polarized Cross test of MKH [measuring and correcting methodology after H-J Haase] method and its association with age and refractive error in clinical population of wide age range. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out with 170 clinical subjects aged 15 – 78  years with an average age of 40. 7 ± 16. 62  years. All the participants had best-corrected visual acuity better than 20 / 25, stereopsis ≤ 60 second of arc, no <b>heterotropia,</b> not undergone vision therapy, and had no eye disease. The distance associated HTF was measured with the Cross test of the MKH methodology. The quantification of associated HTF was acquired by means of Risley rotary prism. Results: The occurrence of distance associated HTF was found in 71. 2 % of participants. Of the total, 36. 5 % of the cases had esophoria (EP), 9. 4 % EP and hyperphoria, 10. 6 % exophoria (XP), 7. 1 % XP and hyperphoria, 7. 6 % hyperphoria, and 28. 8 % orthophoria. The mean distance horizontal associated HTF was + 0. 76 ± 2. 38  ∆. With EP, the mean value was + 2. 47 ± 2. 18  ∆, and with XP, − 2. 1 ± 1. 72  ∆. There was no correlation observed between the amount of distance associated HTF and age. There was no effect of the type and amount of a refractive error on the amount of distance associated HTF.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{identify}} {{the effect of}} infant hypermetropia on residual amblyopia in children remaining after treatment. MATERIALS AND METHODS: 879 strabismic children had cycloplegic retinoscopy {{at the age of}} 6 months and later when strabismus was diagnosed. A total of 26 hypermetropes consistently wore glasses from the age of 6 months, and 305 other hypermetropes had their accommodation periodically assessed by dynamic retinoscopy before strabismus was diagnosed. The relation between the last known visual acuity after treatment and all other clinical findings was analysed using t-tests and regression analysis. RESULTS: Vision less than 6 / 12 in nonfixing eyes was associated with infantile hypermetropia > + 5. 0 D, and in rare instances in excess of - 3. 0 D of myopia. In hypermetropes only, anisometropia was associated with worse amblyopia. Astigmatism was associated with myopia and low levels of hypermetropia but not with worse vision. The vision of fixing eyes that were hypermetropic was significantly worse than that of emmetropic or myopic eyes. Wearing spectacles from the age of 6 months was associated with better vision in the nonfixing eye. Vision in the nonfixing eye of 19 hypermetropic heterotropes who started wearing glasses between 6 and 18 months of age also was better than that of those who started wearing glasses after 18 months of age. Insufficiency of accommodation was related to the degree of infantile hypermetropia, to worse vision and to failure to emmetropise. Difference in amplitude of accommodation between the eyes was largest in hypermetropes with anisometropia > + 1. 50 D and was marginally associated with worse vision in microtropes who became anisometropic after infancy. Hypermetropia decreased more in fixing eyes than in nonfixing eyes, thereby causing anisohypermetropia to increase after infancy. This change was most pronounced in hypermetropic microtropes. Conversely, failure of fixing eyes to emmetropise was associated with an increase in their inability to accommodate and <b>heterotropia.</b> CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of these findings, severe residual amblyopia in children remaining after treatment could be explained by additional vision deprivation. It can be reduced by starting spectacle correction of hypermetropia before the age of 18 months. Anisometropia seemed the result of deficient emmetropisation...|$|E
40|$|Background: Very {{low birth}} weight (VLBW < 1500 g) carries an {{increased}} risk of visual and cognitive deficits. Long term follow-up studies are sparse. The associations between neural structure and visual and cognitive outcome need to be more fully explored. Aims: To describe visual functions in adolescents with VLBW in comparison with a matched control group and to investigate associations with white matter damage of immaturity (WMDI), optic disc measurements and cognitive functions in the VLBW group. Subjects (Papers I-III) : A total of 86 VLBW children survived the neonatal period during a 15 months period in the southeast region of Sweden. Fifty-nine of those, and 55 term control infants, participated in the 15 -year follow-up study. (Paper IV) : A subgroup including 18 VLBW subjects and 29 control subjects participated. Methods: Structural assessments included brain MRI, digital analysis of fundus photographs and cycloplegic refraction. Functional evaluations comprised best corrected visual acuity, stereo acuity, visual fields, ocular alignment, fixation behavior, cognitive visual problems and intellectual level. Results: Twenty-eight percent of the VLBW subjects had WMDI. The mean neural retinal rim area was smaller - in normal sized optic discs - in the VLBW than in the control group (p= 0. 018). The VLBW adolescents had more tortuous retinal arterioles than the controls (p< 0. 001). Astigmatism was more frequent in the VLBW group (19 %; p= 0. 001). Significant differences between the groups were found, to disadvantage of the VLBW subjects, regarding visual acuity, stereo acuity and visual fields. Ocular misalignment, including <b>heterotropia</b> and heterophoria, was more common in the VLBW group (22 %; p= 0. 004). The VLBW subjects had more horizontal vergence instability than the control subjects (p= 0. 035). The structured history revealed higher rates of cognitive visual problems in the VLBW group, in particular within depth, simultaneous, spatial orientation and motion perception. Intelligence quotients including full scale IQ, verbal subtests and performance subtests were significantly lower in the VLBW group. WMDI was significantly associated with visual field sub normality, myopia, ocular misalignment, vergence instability and cognitive visual problems. Subnormal results of performance subtests were associated with decreased visual and stereo acuity, ocular misalignment, vergence instability and cognitive visual problems. Conclusion: This study confirms previous observations that adolescents with VLBW are at a disadvantage regarding visual and cognitive outcome compared with adolescents with normal birth weight. Adolescents with WMDI had more pronounced visual and cognitive dysfunction...|$|E
