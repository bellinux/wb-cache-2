40|$|ABSTRACT To {{determine}} whether feather retention force (FRF) in 6 -wk-old commercial broilers was in-fluenced {{by the presence}} or absence of cutaneous innervation, nerve trunks for the pectoral and sternal feather tracts were severed unilaterally (left side) in Trial 1. In Trial 2, the sternal subcutaneous nerve trunk was severed either unilaterally (left or right side) or bilater-ally. Four days postdenervation, FRF was determined bilaterally either antemortem (immediately prior to stunning) or 2 min after stunning and bleeding (post-mortem). In Trial 1, the pectoral feather tract ante- and postmortem FRF values did not differ significantly for innervated or denervated tracts. In this trial, the sternal feather tract ante- and postmortem FRF values were 13 % higher (44 g) for the denervated (left side) than for the innervated (right side) treatments. Partitioning this difference into the effects of sample side or innervation could not be attained because only the left side was denervated (left-denervation or right-innervated) in Trial 1. In Trial 2, both the left and right sternal feather tracts were represented in equal numbers for the innervated and denervated treatments, and there were no significant differences <b>in</b> <b>FRF</b> related to innervation, left and right side, or ante- and postmortem sample times. The presence or absence of cutaneous nerve innervation does not appear to influence FRF ante- or postmortem.

Broilers (n = 72) were stunned using an electrical saline stunner (35 mA, 7 s) or a shackle-line carbon dioxide gas stunning tunnel (15 to 40 % CO 2 gradient for 90 s). After bleeding for 90 s, the broilers were scalded with a soft scald (53 C for 120 s) or a softer scald (53 C for 90 s). Within 2 min after scalding, feathers from the right femoral feather tract were removed perpendicularly using a force gauge to evaluate FRF.

40|$|The {{fractional}} {{release factor}} (FRF) gives {{information on the}} amount of a halocarbon that is released {{at some point in the}} stratosphere from its source form to the inorganic form, which can harm the ozone layer through catalytic reactions. The quantity is of major importance because it directly affects the calculation of the Ozone Depletion Potential (ODP). To apply FRF in this context, steady-state values are needed, thus representing a molecular property for a given atmospheric situation. In particular, these values should be independent of the tropospheric trends of the respective halogenated trace gases. We analyzed the temporal evolution of FRF from ECHAM/MESSy Atmospheric Chemistry (EMAC) model simulations for several halocarbons and nitrous oxide between 1965 – 2011 on different mean age levels and found that the current formulation of FRF yields highly time-dependent values. We show that this is caused by the way that the tropospheric trend is handled in the current calculation method of FRF. Taking into account chemical loss in the calculation of stratospheric mixing ratios reduces the time-dependence in correlations of different tracers. Therefore we implemented a loss term in the formulation of FRF and applied the parameterization of a "mean arrival time" to our data set. We find that the time-dependence <b>in</b> <b>FRF</b> can almost be compensated by applying a new trend correction in the calculation of FRF.

40|$|Chatter is a {{major problem}} causing poor surface finish, low {{material}} removal rate, machine tool failure, increased tool wear, excessive noise and thus increased cost for machining applications. Chatter vibrations can be avoided using stability diagrams for which tool point frequency response function (FRF) must be determined accurately.

Thirty male ICR mice, aged 6 weeks, were fed an AIN- 93 control diet during the experimental period.

Rates of body weight gain, epididymal fat weight, and serum TG were significantly decreased in the F, FRF 1, FRF 2, and FRF 3 groups, compared to the NF group. LDL-cholesterol was significantly higher in the FRF 3 group than the NF and F groups, but HDL-cholesterol and HDL/TC were significantly lower in the FRF 3 group than in the NF and F groups.

The proposed algorithm is also extended to the uniform circular array (UCA), which realizes the two-dimensional (2 -D) estimation. Using the characteristics of time-frequency rotation and demodulation of FRFT, the observed LFM signals are demodulated into a series of single frequency ones; secondly, operate the beam-space mapping to the single frequency signals <b>in</b> <b>FRF</b> domain, which UCA in array space is changed into the virtual uniform circular array (ULA) in mode space; finally, the DOA estimation can be realized by the traditional spectral estimation method.

40|$|Graduation date: 1994 Greenhouse {{and field}} grown coffee plants {{were used to}} study the {{synchronization}} of flowering and fruiting. The purpose of these studies was to develop methods of improving the selective harvesting of mature coffee fruits by machine. The studies were divided into 4 parts: 1) Synchronization of flowering, 2) Synchronization of fruiting, 3) Determination of fruit detachment and fruit removal force (FRF), and 4) Alteration of the FRF of ripe fruits. Either mist irrigation or water deficit stress followed by sufficient watering were effective in inducing flowering. Gibberellic acid treatment was less effective. Gibberellic acid applied to field grown coffee plants with fruit at different ages up to 40 days after anthesis advanced fruit maturity but did not synchronize fruit maturation. Ethephon sprayed on fruits at 230 days after anthesis resulted in uniform ripening of fruit on greenhouse grown coffee plants. The mechanism of abscission of green and ripe fruits was studied. No abscission layer was found at the sites of detachment in either green or ripe fruits. The detachment of ripe fruits occurred at random, by the breaking of parenchymatous pericarp tissue immediately above the pedicel. In contrast, the detachment of green fruits occurred at random along the pedicel. The FRF of green fruits was greater than the FRF of ripe fruits. The FRF decreased as fruits matured in both the ethephon and control treatments. Indices of fruit maturation were correlated with FRF. Exocarp color change, expressed quantitatively as the degree of lightness (L) and hue angle (θ), was correlated with the FRF. The soluble solids content of the pericarp tissue decreased as fruit matured. There was a strong inverse correlation between FRF and soluble solids content of the pericarp. Further reduction in the FRF of ripe fruits was achieved by mist irrigation. The FRF of green fruits was not affected by the mist irrigation treatment.

30|$|Primarily, {{identification}} of chatter using stability lobe diagram (SLD) is very critical in machining. In machine tools, chatter and non-chatter vibrations separate {{from each other}} using SLD, which {{is a series of}} interconnected lobes in term of axial depth of cut and spindle speed that demarcates the regions of chatter vibrations. Regions below the lobes mean stable chatter vibrations [3]. SLD can be developed in either time or frequency domains. It is much faster to develop SLD in the frequency domain than in time domain. Frequency response function (FRF) [4 – 6], linear time-periodic function [7], and zero order approximation of the characteristics equation [8] are commonly employed to predict chatter vibrations in literature. <b>In</b> <b>FRF,</b> Fast Fourier transform (FFT) can determine the actual machining boundary where unstable cut show high amplitude with high vibration and stable cut show lower vibration with low amplitude [9]. Owing to the above deliberations, two important points, which increased chatter vibration in machining [4 – 6, 10 – 17] were identified as follows: an increase in depth of cut which move up vibration frequency and the effects of high spindle speed on shifting machine dynamic toward unstable cutting vibrations. Dos Santos and Coelho [4] improved the accuracy of chatter prediction in machine tools using the stability lobe diagram. Gagnol et al. [5] develop a spindle dynamic model for rotor equation using Timoshenko beam theory. Eynian [6] used Nyquist contour to predict the stability through dominant poles of the closed loop delay-differential equation for machining systems. Li et al. [10] established a comprehensive dynamic model of milling for stability analysis by considering regeneration, helix angle, and process damping. Solis et al. [11] used nondestructive trials to determine a new transfer function of the milling process for stability analysis. Altintas and Budak [12] and Altintas et al. [13] developed analytical methods for the predictions of chatter in milling. Soliman and Ismail [14] used PD fuzzy controller to limit the chatter indication. Quintana and Ciurana [15] experimentally determined stability lobe by increasing the depth of cut in feed direction. Tsai et al. [16] proposed acoustic signal feedback and spindle speed compensation for intelligent control application to avoid chatter vibration in milling process. Abele and Fiedler [17] created stability lobe of the milling process by considering the dynamic behavior of the system. In the past, efforts have been made by a quite number of researchers to study the problems of machining chatter vibrations [3]. Experimental and finite element (FE) model of machine tool were combined to investigate the vibrations [18, 19]. Kersting et al. [19] highlighted the effects of vibration on the workpiece, which focused on the feedback of workpiece displacement using FE. Dankena et al. [20, 21] related workpiece vibration to the workpiece material and workpiece structure. They pointed out that compound workpiece was a major cause of unfavorable workpiece performance, such as material height deviations, transition deviation at material joint, and surface roughness deviation, as compared to a single workpiece. Ma et al. [22 – 25] attributed vibration of the flexible workpiece to the workpiece fixture, and they improved the stiffness of the workpiece by using magnetorheological (MR) fluid. Ma et al. [22] designed a flexible fixture to investigate the regenerative chatter based on the MR fluids. Ma et al. [23] also proposed a dynamic analytical model by considering fixture constraints and the damping factor. Zeng et al. [24] constructed the dynamic model of the workpiece-fixture-cutter system by using the cutting force and the fixture element as the disturbance input and control input, respectively [24]. Similarly, retrofittable intelligent active fixtures, capable of observing the process in real-time and exert adequate counter-excitations was reported in Ref. [25]. In spindle speed variation, workpiece vibrations are curtailed by selecting suitable spindle speed so that the excitation frequency corresponds to the workpiece resonance [26]. Active control is a process that utilized the actuator force to provide adequate damping force that suppresses chatter vibration [27]. It consumes considerable energy to derive the actuator.|$|E
40|$|Thesis (MScAgric) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2000. ENGLISH ABSTRACT: Postharvest berry {{split and}} abscission are {{prevailing}} physiological disorders that negatively {{impact on the}} quality of table grapes exported from South Africa. Inferior grape quality due to these disorders results in a considerable decline in consumer confidence in the branded product, which leads to a drop in demand, and consequently, lower prices. Since information concerning postharvest factors influencing postharvest berry split and abscission is limited, the search for reliable methods to adequately control these problems remains elusive. In an attempt to obtain the required information, the influence of harvest temperature, harvest maturity, perforated liners, field heat removal prior to packing, delay periods before and after packing, storage duration and the elevation of storage temperature on the development of berry split and abscission in 'Thompson Seedless' (Vitis vinifera Linnaeus) table grapes was investigated. Changes in abscission related factors during berry development, and the influence of pre-and postharvest ethylene inhibitors on the development of berry abscission in 'Waltham Cross' table grapes, was also studied. Berry split was aggravated by packing 'Thompson Seedless' grapes at high pulp temperatures of approximately 30 °C, especially if the grapes were packed in non-perforated bags. The incidence of berry split could be reduced by between 80 and 90 % by packing grapes in perforated instead of non-perforated liners. Perforated bags also reduced levels of S 02 damage. However, due to significantly more moisture loss from grapes in perforated bags, compared to non-perforated bags, the risk of higher fruit and stem desiccation and softer berries existed. Optimum size and density of perforations needs to be determined to reduce berry split without excessive loss of moisture from the grapes, and S 02 gas from the air space surrounding the product. The influence of harvest temperature and liner type on berry abscission was not conclusive. Advanced maturity increased grape resistance to berry split. However, grapes harvested too mature were prone to stem desiccation and the development of Botrytis decay. The occurrence of berry abscission also appeared to increase with advanced harvest maturity. Consequently, to ensure optimal post-storage quality, 'Thompson Seedless' grapes should be harvested as soon as horticultural maturity has been reached, which appears to be at approximately 18 °Brix. Field heat removal for 1. 5 hours at 19 °C prior to packing had no beneficial or adverse effect on berry split and abscission. Delay periods prior to packing aggravated berry abscission, but did not influence berry split significantly. Grapes delayed for 12 hours showed a significant increase in berry abscission and Botrytis decay, compared to grapes delayed for only 3 or 8 hours. Considering that the absence of fungal decay is the most important quality prerequisite in table grapes, it is of vital importance to pack grapes with as short a delay period as possible. Grapes packed in non-perforated liners and delayed for different durations after packing, before the onset of forced-air cooling (FAC), showed significant differences regarding the incidence of berry split. Grapes delayed for 18 hours had significantly higher levels of berry split directly after the delay period, compared to grapes delayed for 6 or 12 hours. No significant difference in berry abscission occurred between grapes delayed for different periods. To minimise the amount of berry split, FAC should be applied as rapidly as possible after the packing of grapes in non-perforated liners. Two storage related factors significantly influenced the incidence of berry split in 'Thompson Seedless' grapes during cold storage significantly, viz. the duration of storage at -O. soC,and the increase in temperature after low temperature storage. Berry split increased almost linearly with prolonged storage at -O. soC. An elevation of storage temperature from -O. soC to 10 °C any time during the cold storage period, further aggravated the split problem. Consequently, the reduction of berry split in 'Thompson Seedless' table grapes during cold storage requires (a) the shortest possible cold storage period, and (b) good temperature management throughout distribution, from initiation of cooling until the final point of sale. The grape berry abscission potential, as quantitatively indexed by the measurement of the fruit removal force (FRF), showed significant changes during berry development of 'Waltham Cross' table grapes, from 27 to 111 days after full bloom (OAFB). This showed that at certain stages of fruit growth, 'Waltham Cross' grapes are more prone to berry abscission. At 27 OAFB, when the berries had an average diameter of 6. 6 mm, the grape bunches showed a significantly higher potential for berry abscission, compared to grapes sampled at a later stage. 'Waltham Cross' has inherently straggly bunches with bare shoulders. Therefore, any abscission during berry development will aggravate the problem. Consequently, it is of vital importance that any adverse factors such as moisture stress be avoided, especially during the period when 'Waltham Cross' grapes appear to be very susceptible to berry abscission. Of all parameters measured, moisture loss showed the best correlation with abscission. Grapes harvested with total soluble solids (TSS) of 12. 3 °Brix, 83 OAFB, had a significantly higher abscission potential than grapes harvested more mature. Therefore, by harvesting 'Waltham Cross' grapes at optimum maturity, at a TSS of approximately 16. 4 °Brix, berry abscission can be reduced to a great extent. It was evident that at veraison, the metabolism of grape berries changes drastically, and additional to the rapid increase in sugars and the rapid decrease in acidity, a decrease <b>in</b> <b>FRF</b> occurs. Preharvest sprays of ReTain™ (a derivative of aminoethoxyvinylglycine), which inhibits ethylene synthesis, showed no promise as a means to reduce postharvest berry abscission. A postharvest treatment with EthylBloc® (1 -methylcyclopropene), which inhibits ethylene action, only reduced berry abscission during one season. AFRIKAANSE OPSOMMING: Die fisiologiese defekte korrelbars en los korrels wat algemeen voorkom tydens opberging van sekere tafeldruif-kultivars, het 'n negatiewe invloed op tafeldruiwe wat uitgevoer word vanaf Suid-Afrika. Minderwaardige kwaliteit as gevolg van hierdie defekte het 'n aansienlike afname in verbruikers-vertroue tot gevolg wat aanleiding gee tot 'n ooreenkomstige afname in aanvraag en prys van die produk. Inligting rakende na-oes faktore wat die voorkoms van korrelbars en los korrels beïnvloed is beperk, en geen gewaarborgde metode bestaan om hierdie twee defekte volkome te beheer nie. In 'n poging om dié gewenste inligting te bekom, is ondersoek ingestel na die effek van oes-temperatuur, oes-rypheid, geperforeerde sakke, veldhitte verwydering voor verpakking, vertragingsperiodes voor en na verpakking, tydsduur van opberging, en die verhoging van die opbergingstemperatuur, op die voorkoms van korrelbars en los korrels by 'Thompson Seedless' (Vitis vinifera Linnaeus) druiwe. Daar is ook ondersoek ingestel na veranderings in afsnoering verwante faktore tydens korrel-ontwikkeling, en die invloed van vooren na-oes toedienings van etileen inhibeerders op die ontwikkeling van los korrels by 'Waltham Cross'tafeldruiwe. Korrelbars is vererger deur 'Thompson Seedless' met hoë pulptemperature van ongeveer 29. 5 °C te verpak, veral indien dit in 'n riie-geperforeerde sak verpak is. Die voorkoms van korrelbars kon tussen 80 en 90 % verminder word deur 'Thompson Seedless' druiwe in geperforeerde sakke te verpak, in plaas van nie-geperforeerde sakke. Geperforeerde sakke het ook S 02 skade op die druiwe verminder. Tog, as gevolg van betekenisvol meer vogverlies vanaf druiwe in geperforeerde sakke as vanaf druiwe in nie-geperforeerde sakke, bestaan die risiko van meer stingel-uitdroging en minder ferm korrels indien druiwe in geperforeerde sakke verpak word. Optimale grootte en digtheid van perforasies moet bepaal word om korrelbars te verminder, maar sonder oormatige vogverlies vanaf die druiwe en oormatige verlies aan S 02. Die invloed van oes-temperatuur en sak-tipe op los korrels was nie oortuigend nie. Gevorderde oes-rypheid het die druif se weerstand teen korrelbars verhoog. Daarteenoor was druiwe wat té ryp geoes is, meer gevoelig vir stingel-uitdroging en Botrytis bederf. Dit wilook voorkom of die voorkoms van los korrels toeneem met gevorderde rypheid. Dus, om optimum kwaliteit na opberging te verseker, moet 'Thompson Seedless' geoes word sodra hortologiese rypheid bereik word, wat blyk om by 'n totale opgeloste vaste stof-inhoud (TOVS) van ongeveer 18 °Brix te wees. Veldhitte verwydering voor verpakking, vir 1. 5 uur by 19 °C, het geen effek gehad op die voorkoms van korrelbars en los korrels nie. 'n Vertragingsperiode voor verpakking het die los korrel-probleem vererger, alhoewel dit geen betekenisvolle invloed op die voorkoms van korrelbars gehad het nie. Druiwe wat vir 12 uur voor verpakking vertraag is, het betekenisvol meer los korrels en Botrytis bederf getoon, in vergelyking met druiwe wat slegs 'n vertragingsperiode van 3 of 8 uur ondergaan het. Aangesien die afwesigheid van bederf die belangrikste kwaliteits-vereiste vir tafeldruiwe is, is dit van kardinale belang om druiwe so gou as moontlik na oes te verpak. Druiwe, verpak in nie-geperforeerde sakke, wat vir verskillende periodes vertraag is voor geforseerde-lug verkoeling, het betekenisvolle verskille getoon betreffende die voorkoms van korrelbars. Druiwe vertraag vir 18 ure voor verkoeling, het betekenisvol meer korrelbars getoon, soos gemeet onmiddellik na die vertragingsperiode, in vergelyking met druiwe wat slegs vir 6 of 12 ure vertraag was. Geen betekenisvolle verskille in los korrels het voorgekom tussen druiwe wat verskillende vertragingsperiodes ondergaan het nie. Om korrelbars te verminder, moet geforseerde-lug verkoeling so gou as moontlik na verpakking van druiwe in nie-geperforeerde sakke toegepas word. Twee opbergings-verwante faktore beïnvloed die voorkoms van korrelbars by 'Thompson Seedless' druiwe tydens koelopberging, naamlik die tydsduur van opberging by -O. soC,asook 'n styging in temperatuur vanaf -O. soC tot 1 DoC. Korrelbars het feitlik liniêr toegeneem met verlengde opberging by -O. soC. 'n Styging in temperatuur vanaf -O. SoCtot 1 DoCop enige tydstip gedurende die koelopbergingsperiode, het korrelbars verder vererger. Dus, om korrelbars by 'Thompson Seedless' tydens opberging tot die minimum te beperk, moet die tydsduur van opberging so kort as moontlik wees, en moet die koue ketting regdeur die distribusie-proses gehandhaaf word, vanaf inisiëring van verkoeling tot en met die uiteindelike verkoop van die produk. Die afsnoerings-potensiaal van druiwe, soos kwantitatief geïndekseer is deur meting van die vrug-verwyderings-vermoë (VVV), het betekenisvol verander gedurende korrel-ontwikkeling van 'Waltham Cross' tafeldruiwe, vanaf 27 tot 111 dae na volblom (DNVB). Dit het getoon dat 'Waltham Cross' druiwe by sekere stadiums van vrug-groei meer gevoelig is vir korrel afsnoering. By 27 DNVB, wanneer die korrels 'n gemiddelde deursnee van 6. 6 mm gehad het, het die druiwe 'n betekenisvolle hoër potensiaal vir afsnoering getoon, in vergelyking met druiwe wat op 'n latere stadium getoets is. 'Waltham Cross' is inherent geneig tot yl trosse met kaal skouers, gevolglik sal enige afsnoering tydens korrel-ontwikkeling die probleem vererger. Dus is dit van kardinale belang dat enige nadelige faktor, soos byvoorbeeld vogstres, vermy moet word, veral gedurende periodes wanneer dit wil voorkom of 'Waltham Cross' baie vatbaar is vir korrel afsnoering. Van al die parameters wat gemeet is, het vogverlies die beste korrelasie met korrel afsnoering getoon. Druiwe wat 83 DNVB, by 'n TOVS van 12. 3 °Brix geoes is, het 'n betekenisvol hoër potensiaal vir korrel afsnoering getoon, in vergelyking met druiwe wat ryper geoes is. Dus, deur 'Waltham Cross' druiwe by optimum rypheid te oes, by 'n TOVS van ongeveer 16. 4 °Brix, kan korrelbars in 'n groot mate verminder word. Tydens verelson, wanneer die metabolisme van die druiwe drasties verander, was daar gepaardgaande met die drastiese toename in TOVS en die drastiese afname in totale titreerbare sure (TSS), ook 'n afname in Voor-oes bespuitings met ReTain™, wat etileen sintese inhibeer, het geen potensiaal getoon om los korrels by 'Waltham Cross' te verminder nie. 'n Na-oes behandeling met EthyIBloc®, wat etileen werking inhibeer, het slegs korrel afsnoering in een van die seisoene effens verminder...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} {{the problem of}} {{estimating}} unknown parameters in nonlinear gray-box models that may be multivariable, nonlinear, unstable, and resonant at the same time. A straightforward use of time-domain predication-error methods {{for this type of}} problem easily ends up in a large and numerically stiff optimization problem. We therefore propose an identification procedure that uses intermediate local models that allow for data compression and a less complex optimization problem. The procedure is based on the estimation of the nonparametric frequency response function (<b>FRF)</b> <b>in</b> a number of operating points. The nonlinear gray-box model is linearized in the same operating points, resulting <b>in</b> parametric <b>FRFs.</b> The optimal parameters are finally obtained by minimizing the discrepancy between the nonparametric and parametric FRFs. The procedure is illustrated by estimating elasticity parameters in a six-axes industrial robot. Different parameter estimators are compared and experimental results show the usefulness of the proposed identification procedure. The weighted logarithmic least squares estimator achieves the best result and the identified model gives a good global description of the dynamics in the frequency range of interest for robot control.

40|$|In modal testing, the {{measured}} frequency response functions (FRFs) are often affected by transducer mass effects.

This paper deals with removing sensors mass effects from {{the measured}} <b>FRFs</b> <b>in</b> hammer impact testing. The proposed method offers some advantages over the available techniques <b>in</b> that extra <b>FRFs</b> measurements with different configurations are not required during the correction process. Firstly, correction method for single accelerometer case is discussed. Further, general correction formulation for multiple accelerometers case is derived. Then, validations of the proposed method are demonstrated using simulated and experimental data. It shows good effectiveness in experimental validation for single accelerometer case. Numerical simulation also demonstrates a good performance for multiple accelerometers case. However, further simulations with noisy-polluted data show that the accuracy of correction results will be affected to some extent by the noise. It is suggested that the measured FRFs be preprocessed using the curve-fitting procedure or noise reduction processing before applying the proposed method...|$|R

40|$|A {{detailed}} nonlinear {{model for}} a hydraulic pitch actuator under healthy and faulty situations is introduced in the FAST/AERODYN wind turbine simulator. Frequency response functions (FRF) are determined by using a random phase multi-sine excitation for different healthy and faulty operating conditions. The major changes observed <b>in</b> the <b>FRF</b> arise significantly above the actuator bandwidth. A linear model of the actuator thus appears to be sufficient to simulate the wind turbine in healthy conditions.

Finally a user friendly graphical interface is presented for the wind turbine simulator. SCOPUS: cp. pSCOPUS: cp. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R

This approximation leads to calculation of the first-order describing functions. By having the experimental describing functions calculated and the system’s responses corresponding to the nonlinear element (measured or interpolated), nonlinear parameter identification can be performed.
