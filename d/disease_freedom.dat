40|$|Demonstrating <b>disease</b> <b>freedom</b> is {{becoming}} important in different fields including animal disease control. Most methods consider sampling {{only from a}} homogeneous population in which each animal has the same probability of becoming infected. In this paper, we propose a new methodology to calculate the probability of detecting the disease if it is present in a heterogeneous population of small size with potentially different risk groups, differences in risk being defined using relative risks. To calculate this probability, for each possible arrangement of the infected animals in the different groups, the probability that all the animals tested are test-negative given this arrangement is multiplied by the probability that this arrangement occurs. The probability formula is developed using the assumption of a perfect test and hypergeometric sampling for finite small size populations. The methodology is applied to scrapie, a disease affecting small ruminants and characterized in sheep by a strong genetic susceptibility defining different risk groups. It illustrates that the genotypes of the tested animals influence heavily the confidence level of detecting scrapie. The results present the statistical power for substantiating <b>disease</b> <b>freedom</b> in a small heterogeneous population {{as a function of}} the design prevalence, the structure of the sample tested, the structure of the herd and the associated relative risks...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The {{public health}} threat {{represented}} by a potential circulation of bovine spongiform encephalopathy agent in sheep population has led European animal health authorities to launch large screening and genetic selection programmes. If demonstrated, such a circulation would have dramatic economic consequences for sheep breeding sector. In this context, {{it is important to}} evaluate the feasibility of qualification procedures that would allow sheep breeders demonstrating their flock is free from scrapie. Classical approaches, based on surveys designed to detect disease presence, do not account for scrapie specificities: the genetic variations of susceptibility and the absence of live diagnostic test routinely available. Adapting these approaches leads to a paradoxical situation in which a greater amount of testing is needed to substantiate <b>disease</b> <b>freedom</b> in genetically resistant flocks than in susceptible flocks, whereas probability of <b>disease</b> <b>freedom</b> is a priori higher in the former than in the latter. The goal {{of this study was to}} propose, evaluate and compare several qualification strategies for demonstrating a flock is free from scrapie. Results A probabilistic framework was defined that accounts for scrapie specificities and allows solving the preceding paradox. Six qualification strategies were defined that combine genotyping data, diagnostic tests results and flock pedigree. These were compared in two types of simulated flocks: resistant and susceptible flocks. Two strategies allowed demonstrating <b>disease</b> <b>freedom</b> in several years, for the majority of simulated flocks: a strategy in which all the flock animals are genotyped, and a strategy in which only founders animals are genotyped, the flock pedigree being known. In both cases, diagnostic tests are performed on culled animals. The less costly strategy varied according to the genetic context (resistant or susceptible) and to the relative costs of a genotyping exam and of a diagnostic test. Conclusion This work demonstrates that combining data sources allows substantiating a flock is free from scrapie within a reasonable time frame.

40|$|Increased {{demand for}} animal disease {{surveillance}} information {{has led to}} the development and refinement of methodologies for qualitative and quantitative surveillance system evaluations to maximize efficiency and efficaciousness. The impetus for this surveillance evaluation project was chronic wasting disease (CWD) and the objectives were to apply both qualitative and quantitative methodologies to examine the components of CWD surveillance in Saskatchewan. A retrospective review of deer pathology and hunter-harvest submissions in Saskatchewan was conducted through the Canadian Cooperative Wildlife Health Centre. Qualitative evaluation methods outlined by Klauke et al (1988) were used and included key stakeholder interviews. A quantitative evaluation, with specific focus on disease detection, was conducted to examine system sensitivity, confidence of <b>disease</b> <b>freedom</b> and to compare system components using methods described by Martin et al (2007). The analysis was conducted using a scenario tree and Monte Carlo simulation. Sampling rates of dead and clinically ill deer were low {{with a high degree of}} variability by season, year, location and nature of submissions. Ultimately, variability of submission patterns likely affected when and where diseases were detected. Poor data quality reduced the amount of available data for analysis but quality dramatically improved over time. The surveillance evaluation demonstrated that the current surveillance system places more emphasis on monitoring trends in CWD-positive areas, at the expense of early detection. This is explained mostly by the coupling of disease control efforts and surveillance, in that harvests are heavily focused in CWD-positive areas. The system is not sufficient to detect disease in new areas where the disease prevalence is low, primarily due to low submission rates. The quantitative evaluation found that overall sensitivity of the surveillance system and confidence of <b>disease</b> <b>freedom</b> was highly dependent on detection prevalence and the ongoing risk of disease introduction. Surveillance in the eastern part of Saskatchewan was not adequate from 1997 - 2006 to detect CWD at 0. 5 - 1 % prevalence. However, if risk of CWD introduction over this time period was assumed to be low, it can be concluded that the prevalence in this region was not 5 % or higher. A detection goal of 0. 5 - 1 % prevalence is an ambitious surveillance goal, especially in areas where the risk of disease introduction is high. The use of more targeted surveillance strategies should be further explored to help better meet surveillance these surveillance objectives...|$|E

Coronary angioplasty is increasingly used in patients with multivessel disease. Methods. The source of data was the clinical data base at Emory University. Patients who had previous coronary revascularization or who underwent angioplasty {{in the setting of}} acute myocardial infarction were excluded. Results. Of 10, 783 patients, 71 % had one-vessel, 24 % two-vessel and 5 % three-vessel disease. Age, male gender, diabetes, hypertension, history of previous myocardial infarction, Canadian Cardiovascular Society class III or IV angina and congestive failure all increased with severity of disease. Complete revascularization was achieved in most patients with one-vessel disease, in a minority with two-vessel disease and rarely in those with three-vessel disease. Emergency coronary bypass surgery increased from 1. 7 % with one-vessel disease to 3. 2 % with three-vessel disease. Q wave myocardial infarctions could not be shown to vary significantly with severity of disease. The mortality rate increased from 0. 2 % with one-vessel disease to 1. 2 % with three-vessel disease. The number of vessels diseased was a multivariate correlate of in-hospital and long-term mortality. The 1 -, 5 - and 10 -year survival was 0. 99, 0. 93 and 0. 86 for one-vessel disease and 0. 97, 0. 89 and 0. 76 for two-vessel disease, respectively.

The last approximately 30 years has witnessed worldwide increasing scientific research, consumer activity, and political response towards housing condition, health and welfare issues of dairy cattle. All buildings and housing systems for dairy cattle should be designed, constructed, maintained and managed to assist in the achievement of the Five Freedoms: freedom from hunger and thirst, freedom from discomfort, freedom from pain, injury and <b>disease,</b> <b>freedom</b> to express normal behaviour and freedom from fear and distress. Whether dairy cows are housed in cubicles, straw yards or cow sheds, in order to maximize their performance and to ensure satisfactory standards of welfare, the accommodation must provide the most basic behavioral and physiological needs. As an absolute minimum, the housing must provide a comfortable, clean, well drained and dry lying area together with shelter from adverse weather. Also, it must allow the cow to move freely around without risk of injury and certain diseases. If the housing system does not provide for these basic needs, then not only will health, welfare and production of dairy cattle be compromised, but it is likely that failure to comply with the welfare codes and the law relating to animal welfare will occur...|$|E
40|$|ObjectiveThe {{present study}} {{assessed}} the clinical and echocardiographic outcomes for 1000 patients undergoing minimally invasive mitral valve surgery. MethodsThe Brigham Cardiac Valve database was reviewed. From August 1996 to November 2011, 1000 patients had undergone minimally invasive mitral valve surgery (median follow-up, 7 years). Data on the surgical approach, complications, reoperations, and late survival were tabulated. Late echocardiographic {{data on the}} recurrence of mitral regurgitation after mitral repair in myxomatous disease were also collected. Survival, freedom from reoperation and recurrent mitral regurgitation (grade ≥  3 +) were evaluated with life tables and Kaplan-Meier analyses. ResultsThe mean patient age was 57 years. Of the 1000 patients, 41 % were women. Myxomatous degenerative disease was the predominant pathologic entity (86 %). A lower hemisternotomy was the predominant surgical approach (75 %). Mitral repair was performed in 923 patients and replacement in 77. Eight operative deaths (0. 8 %) occurred. A total of 44 patients with failed mitral repairs underwent reoperation, with 1 mitral valve replaced again on the same operative day for atrioventricular groove disruption. Nine failed repairs were repaired again (9 / 44 [20 %]). A total of 106 late deaths occurred. The overall survival at 15 years was 79 % ±  3 %. Freedom from reoperation at 15 years was 90 % ±  3 % for repairs and 100 % for replacements. Late echocardiograms were acquired for 615 of 815 eligible mitral repair patients with myxomatous <b>disease</b> (75 %). <b>Freedom</b> from recurrent mitral regurgitation (grade ≥  3 +) at 1, 5, and 10 years was 99 % ±  1 %, 87 % ±  2 %, and 69 % ±  4 %, respectively. ConclusionsMinimally invasive mitral valve surgery is effective, with excellent late results. The durability of minimally invasive mitral valve repair compared favorably with conventional full sternotomy methods at late follow-up...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In {{head and}} neck cancer, {{bilateral}} neck irradiation is the standard approach for many tumor locations and stages. Increasing knowledge on the pattern of nodal invasion leads to more precise targeting and normal tissue sparing. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the morbidity and tumor control for patients with well lateralized squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity and oropharynx treated with ipsilateral radiotherapy. Methods Twenty consecutive patients with lateralized carcinomas of the oral cavity and oropharynx were treated with a prospective management approach using ipsilateral irradiation between 2000 and 2007. This included 8 radical oropharyngeal and 12 postoperative oral cavity carcinomas, with Stage T 1 -T 2, N 0 -N 2 b <b>disease.</b> The actuarial <b>freedom</b> from contralateral nodal recurrence was determined. Late xerostomia was evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer QLQ-H&N 35 questionnaire and the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE), version 3. Results At a median follow-up of 58 months, five-year overall survival and loco-regional control rates were 82. 5 % and 100 %, respectively. No local or contralateral nodal recurrences were observed. Mean dose to the contralateral parotid gland was 4. 72 Gy and to the contralateral submandibular gland was 15. 30 Gy. Mean score for dry mouth was 28. 1 on the 0 - 100 QLQ-H&N 35 scale. According to CTCAE v 3 scale, 87. 5 % of patients had grade 0 - 1 and 12. 5 % grade 2 subjective xerostomia. The unstimulated salivary flow was > 0. 2 ml/min in 81. 2 % of patients and 0. 1 - 0. 2 ml/min in 19 %. None of the patients showed grade 3 xerostomia. Conclusion In selected patients with early and moderate stages, well lateralized oral and oropharyngeal carcinomas, ipsilateral irradiation treatment of the primary site and ipsilateral neck spares salivary gland function without compromising loco-regional control. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives: Although many {{advantages}} of mitral valve reconstruction have been demonstrated, whether specific subgroups of patients exist in whom mechanical valve replacement offers advantages over mitral reconstruction remains undetermined. Methods: This {{study examined the}} late results of mitral valve surgery in patients with mitral insufficiency who received either a St. Jude Medical valve (n = 514) or a mitral valve reconstruction with ring annuloplasty (n = 725) between 1980 and 1996. Results: Overall operative mortality was 7. 2 % in the patients receiving a St. Jude Medical mitral valve and 5. 4 % in those undergoing mitral valve reconstruction (no significant difference); isolated mortality was 2. 5 % in the St. Jude Medical group and 2. 2 % in the valve reconstruction group (no significant difference). The follow-up interval was more than 5 years for 340 patients {{with a mean of}} 39. 8 months (98. 5 % complete). Overall 8 -year freedom from late cardiac death, reoperation, and all valve-related complications was 72. 8 % for the St. Jude Medical group and 64. 8 % for valve reconstruction group (no significant difference). For patients with isolated, nonrheumatic mitral valve <b>disease,</b> 8 -year <b>freedom</b> from late cardiac death and reoperation was better in the mitral valve reconstruction group (88. 3 %) than in the St. Jude Medical valve group (86. 0 %; p = 0. 05). Furthermore, Cox proportional hazards regression revealed that mitral valve reconstruction was independently associated with a lesser incidence of late cardiac death (p = 0. 04), irrespective of preoperative New York Heart Association class. However, the St. Jude Medical valve offered better 8 -year freedom from late cardiac death, reoperation, and all valve-related complications than did mitral valve reconstruction in patients with multiple valve disease (77. 0 % vs 45. 3 %; p < 0. 01). Conclusions: Therefore, mitral valve reconstruction appears to be the procedure of choice for isolated, nonrheumatic disease, whereas insertion of a St. Jude Medical valve should be preferred for patients with multiple valve disease.
