5|$|Following {{his visit}} to Valley Forge, Allen {{traveled}} to Salisbury, arriving on May 25, 1778. There he learned that his brother Heman had died just the previous week, and that his brother Zimri, who had been caring for Allen's family and farm, <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spring following his capture. The death of Heman, with whom Allen had been quite close, hit him quite hard.|$|E
5|$|Having {{departed}} Cadix, the Polish personnel evaded the occupying Italian security {{police and}} German Gestapo {{and sought to}} escape France via Spain.

5|$|Incorrect {{unloading}} sequences and ballasting {{which resulted}} in the buoyancy of the hull becoming uneven and the hull therefore strained: Lack of crew training or knowing malpractice were possible explanations. Total was held largely to blame for this.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{report of}} casualties {{came in a}} special message by President Lyndon B. Johnson sent to Congress on January 30, 1967. In the message, the president said 80 people <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> smog. Johnson did not cite a source of that claim, {{and there is no}} known source concluding that 80 people died, other than those citing Johnson.|$|E
5|$|After a long siege, Andi Guru and Tiku's former {{lieutenant}} Tandi Bunna'– both by {{then working}} for the Dutch– approached Tiku on 26 October and offered a cease fire. Although initially unwilling, Tiku was reportedly convinced by civilians who reminded him that his mother– who <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> siege– needed to be buried. After three days of peaceful intermingling, {{on the night of}} 30 October the Dutch forces took over the fortress, appropriated all weapons, and captured Tiku.

5|$|After the Allies {{landed in}} Sumatra, {{many of the}} Muslim Indian {{soldiers}} brought by the English deserted and joined the native revolutionaries. They planned strategy in the mosque, including the assault on a British barracks. One of these Indian soldiers, who <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> assault, was buried at the mosque. Since 1950, after Indonesia's independence was recognised, the Ganting Grand Mosque has hosted numerous statesmen from both Indonesia and abroad, including Vice President Mohammad Hatta, Minister of Defence Sultan HamengkubuwanaIX, and General Abdul Haris Nasution. Foreign dignitaries who have visited the mosque included people from Malaysia, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.|$|E

Honour rolls in Canada were very popular, particularly immediately {{after the end of the}} war, although the decision on which names to include on them proved contentious: should accidental deaths, for example, be included? Where it was impractical to inscribe names in churches, usually due to the number of casualties and available space, books of names were often recorded instead.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} {{hours of the}} rioting, state media only {{reported}} that three people had been killed. The number rose sharply, though, after the first night's rioting; at midday on Monday, 6 July, Xinhua announced that 129 people <b>had</b> <b>died.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> following days the death toll reported by various government sources (including Xinhua and party officials) gradually grew, with the last official update on 18 July placing the tally at 197 dead, 1,721 injured. The World Uyghur Congress has claimed that the death toll was around 600.|$|E

5|$|Eardwulf {{was evidently}} married {{before he became}} king, as Alcuin reproached him for abandoning his wife for a {{concubine}} soon after his coronation. This strained relations with the new Archbishop Eanbald II—Eanbald I <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> year of Eardwulf's coronation. Alcuin, while condemning secular oppression of the church, affected surprise that while the Archbishop Eanbald was travelling he {{was accompanied by a}} large retinue, including soldiers, and that he received and protected the king's enemies. Eanbald was presumably in conflict with Eardwulf over property, but it is likely that he also supported rivals for Eardwulf's throne.|$|E
5|$|Fort Ridgely {{was built}} in 1853–1854 near the Dakota {{reservation}} in southwestern Minnesota, near modern New Ulm. It was named by U.S. Secretary of War Jefferson Davis in honor of three army officers named Ridgely who <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Mexican-American War. The fort was created to watch over the Minnesota River Valley, {{in addition to the}} larger frontier. It replaced Fort Doge in Iowa, which was decommissioned during the same period. The fort operated as a military post until 1867.|$|E
5|$|Lapensée was {{reputed to}} have scored over 150 goals {{and led her}} team to be unbeaten {{throughout}} 1916 and 1917, when records indicate that they won 45 of their 46 games. However, after demanding {{a share of the}} profits from the games, Lapensée disappeared from the sport in 1918, still aged under 20. There were a number of rumours: that she <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1918 flu pandemic, that she had travelled to New York to undergo a sex-change, or that she had always been a draft dodging man, though none provided any credible evidence. A 1940 profile of her father refuted all those claims, detailing her as living as a woman in New York.|$|E

5|$|On November 24, 1835, Blackburn {{married his}} distant cousin, Ella Gist Boswell. Boswell's father, Dr. Joseph Boswell, <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Lexington cholera {{epidemic}} a year earlier. The couple's only child, son Cary Bell Blackburn, {{was born in}} 1837. Just before Cary's birth, Blackburn invested heavily in the hemp rope and bagging industry and suffered a significant financial loss when the business venture subsequently failed. In 1843, Blackburn was elected as a Whig to the Kentucky House of Representatives and served a single, undistinguished term. He did not seek re-election, and in 1844, he {{and his younger brother}} opened a medical practice in Frankfort, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{aircraft}} had departed from U.S. soil and U.S. nationals <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> incident, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) was legally required to investigate. On {{the morning of}} September 1, the NTSB chief in Alaska, James Michelangelo, received an order from the NTSB in Washington {{at the behest of}} the State Department requiring all documents relating to the NTSB investigation to be sent to Washington, and notifying him that the State Department would now conduct the investigation.|$|E
5|$|The French {{approach}} to funding memorials also relied mainly on voluntary fundraising, but featured {{a greater role}} for the state. A law passed in 1919 provided for a subsidy from central government to local authorities to assist in building memorials; the money was distributed {{in proportion to the}} number of local citizens who <b>had</b> <b>died</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> war. Nonetheless the largest French projects, such as the Ossuary of Douaumont, were still paid for mostly through private fund raising across France and the international community: it could take many years to raise the sums required. The Ossuary cost 15 m francs to build; {{at the other end of}} the scale, more modest urban memorials cost around 300,000 francs.|$|E
