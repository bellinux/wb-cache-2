2500|$|The {{overseas}} {{countries and}} territories (OCT) are dependent territories that have a special relationship with one of the member states of the EU, and have been explicitly invited by the EU treaty to join the EU-OCT Association (OCTA). They were listed in [...] acc. to Article 198 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, which aside from inviting them to join OCTA, also provided them the opportunity to opt into EU provisions on the freedom of movement for workers and <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment.</b> Yet, the <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> is limited by Article 203 TFEU and the respective Council Decision on OCTs (...) [...] Its Article 51(1)(a) prescribes only that [...] "the Union shall accord to natural and legal persons of the OCTs a treatment no less favourable than the most favourable treatment applicable to like natural and legal persons of any third country with whom the Union concludes or has concluded an economic integration agreement." [...] Again this can be, according to Article 51(2)(b) limited. The obligations provided for in paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to treatment granted under measures providing for recognition of qualifications, licences or prudential measures in accordance with Article VII of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) or the GATS Annex on Financial [...] Services.|$|E
2500|$|As well as {{creating}} rights for [...] "workers" [...] who generally lack bargaining {{power in the}} market, the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union also protects the [...] "freedom of establishment" [...] in article 49, and [...] "freedom to provide services" [...] in article 56. In Gebhard v Consiglio dell’Ordine degli Avvocati e Procuratori di Milano the Court of Justice held that to be [...] "established" [...] means to participate in economic life [...] "on a stable and continuous basis", while providing [...] "services" [...] meant pursuing activity more [...] "on a temporary basis". This meant that a lawyer from Stuttgart, who had set up chambers in Milan and was censured by the Milan Bar Council for not having registered, should claim for breach of establishment freedom, rather than service freedom. However, the requirements to be registered in Milan before being able to practice would be allowed if they were non-discriminatory, [...] "justified by imperative requirements in the general interest" [...] and proportionately applied. All people or entities that engage in economic activity, particularly the self-employed, or [...] "undertakings" [...] such as companies or firms, {{have a right to}} set up an enterprise without unjustified restrictions. The Court of Justice has held that both a member state government and a private party can hinder <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment,</b> so article 49 has both [...] "vertical" [...] and [...] "horizontal" [...] direct effect. In Reyners v Belgium the Court of Justice held that a refusal to admit a lawyer to the Belgian bar because he lacked Belgian nationality was unjustified. TFEU article 49 says states are exempt from infringing others' <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> when they exercise [...] "official authority". But regulation of an advocate's work (as opposed to a court's) was not official. By contrast in Commission v Italy the Court of Justice held that a requirement for lawyers in Italy to comply with maximum tariffs unless there was an agreement with a client was not a restriction. The Grand Chamber of the Court of Justice held the Commission had not proven that this had any object or effect of limiting practitioners from entering the market. Therefore, there was no prima facie infringement <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> that needed to be justified.|$|E
2500|$|In {{regard to}} companies, the Court of Justice held in R (Daily Mail and General Trust plc) v HM Treasury that member states could {{restrict}} a company moving its seat of business, without infringing TFEU article 49. This meant the Daily Mail newspaper's parent company could not evade tax by shifting its residence to the Netherlands without first settling its tax {{bills in the}} UK. The UK {{did not need to}} justify its action, as rules on company seats were not yet harmonised. By contrast, in Centros Ltd v Erhversus-og Selkabssyrelsen the Court of Justice found that a UK limited company operating in Denmark could not be required to comply with Denmark's minimum share capital rules. UK law only required £1 of capital to start a company, while Denmark's legislature took the view companies should only be started up if they had 200,000 Danish krone (around €27,000) to protect creditors if the company failed and went insolvent. The Court of Justice held that Denmark's minimum capital law infringed Centros Ltd's <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> and could not be justified, because a company in the UK could admittedly provide services in Denmark without being established there, and there were less restrictive means of achieving the aim of creditor protection. This approach was criticised as potentially opening the EU to unjustified regulatory competition, and a race to the bottom in legal standards, like the US state of Delaware, which is argued to attract companies with the worst standards of accountability, and unreasonably low corporate tax. Appearing to meet the concern, in Überseering BV v Nordic Construction GmbH the Court of Justice held that a German court could not deny a Dutch building company the right to enforce a contract in Germany, simply because it was not validly incorporated in Germany. Restrictions on <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> could be justified by creditor protection, labour rights to participate in work, or the public interest in collecting taxes. But in this case denial of capacity went too far: it was an [...] "outright negation" [...] of the right of establishment. Setting a further limit, in Cartesio Oktató és Szolgáltató bt the Court of Justice held that because corporations are created by law, they must be subject to any rules for formation that a state of incorporation wishes to impose. This meant the Hungarian authorities could prevent a company from shifting its central administration to Italy, while it still operated and was incorporated in Hungary. Thus, the court draws a distinction between the right of establishment for foreign companies (where restrictions must be justified), and the right of the state to determine conditions for companies incorporated in its territory, although it is not entirely clear why.|$|E

40|$|Michael Servetus {{occupies}} a unique {{place in the}} annals of European history. He was a lonely scholar and a bold mind who left two great legacies. 1 In the realm of intellectual inquiry he demanded a radical reevaluation of the entire ideological religious system of assertions and dogmas imposed on Western Europe since the fourth century. Servetus's theological inquiry initiated the study of scriptural tradition in an attempt to uncover the real religious doctrines contained in it. On the moral societal level Servetus demanded <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> intellectual inquiry, thought, conscience, and expression that was denied to millions on doctrinal theological grounds. By his sacrifice Servetus set into motion a process of change in the entire social paradigm and recovery of the right to <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> conscience. <b>Establishment</b> <b>of</b> an ecclesiastical paradigm. Servetus’s role as a central figure in history who initiated the process of recovering the social humanistic paradigm becomes obvious if we put it in a historical perspective.

Other than this, most important standards in a typical company law are left to member state law, so long as they comply with further minimum requirements in the company law directives. Duties owed by the board of directors to the company and its stakeholders, or the right to bring derivative claims to vindicate constitutional rights, are not generally regulated by EU law. Nor are rights of pre-emption to buy shares, nor rights of any party regarding claims by tort, contract or piercing the corporate veil to hold directors and shareholders accountable. However, Directives do require minimum rights on company formation, capital maintenance, accounting and audit, market regulation, board neutrality in a takeover bid, rules on mergers, and management of cross-border insolvency. The omission of minimum standards is important since the Court of Justice held in Centros that <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> requires companies operate in any member state they choose. This has been argued to risk a [...] "race to the bottom" [...] in standards, although the Court of Justice soon affirmed in Inspire Art that companies must still comply with proportionate requirements that are in the [...] "public interest".|$|E
2500|$|Free {{movement}} of capital was traditionally {{seen as the}} fourth freedom, after goods, workers and persons, services and establishment. The original Treaty of Rome required that restrictions on free capital flows only be removed {{to the extent necessary}} for the common market. From the Treaty of Maastricht, now in TFEU article 63, [...] "all restrictions on the {{movement of}} capital between Member States and between Member States and third countries shall be prohibited". This means capital controls of various kinds are prohibited, including limits on buying currency, limits on buying company shares or financial assets, or government approval requirements for foreign investment. By contrast, taxation of capital, including corporate tax, capital gains tax and Financial transaction tax are not affected so long as they do not discriminate by nationality. According to the Capital Movement Directive 1988, Annex I, 13 categories of capital which must move free are covered. In Baars v Inspecteur der Belastingen Particulieren the Court of Justice held that for investments in companies, the capital rules, rather than <b>freedom</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> rules, were engaged if an investment did not enable a [...] "definite influence" [...] through shareholder voting or other rights by the investor. That case held a Dutch Wealth Tax Act 1964 unjustifiably exempted Dutch investments, but not Mr Baars' investments in an Irish company, from the tax: the wealth tax, or exemptions, had to be applied equally. On the other hand, TFEU article 65(1) does not prevent taxes that distinguish taxpayers based on their residence or the location of an investment (as taxes commonly focus on a person's actual source of profit) or any measures to prevent tax evasion. Apart from tax cases, largely following from the opinions of Advocate General Maduro, a series of cases held that government owned golden shares were unlawful. In Commission v Germany the Commission claimed the German Volkswagen Act 1960 violated article 63, in that §2(1) restricted any party having voting rights exceeding 20% of the company, and §4(3) allowed a minority of 20% of shares held by the Lower Saxony government to block any decisions. Although this was not an impediment to actual purchase of shares, or receipt of dividends by any shareholder, the Court of Justice's Grand Chamber agreed that it was disproportionate for the government's stated aim of protecting workers or minority shareholders. Similarly, in Commission v Portugal the Court of Justice held that Portugal infringed free movement of capital by retaining golden shares in Portugal Telecom that enabled disproportionate voting rights, by creating a [...] "deterrent effect on portfolio investments" [...] and reduing [...] "the attractiveness of an investment". This suggested the Court's preference that a government, if it sought public ownership or control, should nationalise in full the desired proportion of a company in line with TFEU article 345.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the legal aspects of aviation {{insurance and reinsurance}} regarding passenger liability, in particular in Europe. The paper identifies and describes four main trends currently affecting the aviation insurance industry: the globalization of aviation insurance and reinsurance undertakings, increased competition in aviation insurance sector, the liberalization of the European insurance market, {{and the evolution of}} the international and European air carriers liability regime. The implications of these trends for premium rates, and for insurance and reinsurance activities in general, are then assessed. This analysis indicates that the liberalization of the European insurance and reinsurance markets remains incomplete, given that certain essential aspects linked to the activities of insurance undertakings are not harmonized. This lack of consistency within the European regulatory regime is found {{to be a source of}} invisible barriers which hamper the effective application <b>of</b> the European <b>freedoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> and <b>of</b> providing services as established in the Treaty of Rome. Furthermore, the author identifies a potential for growing friction between the different international regulatory regimes governing air carriers liability. Looking to the future, the expected effects of the single European currency and the expansion of the WTO services disciplines is also examined. The author concludes that the effectiveness of traditional structures and organizations of insurance and reinsurance markets are being challenged by profound structural changes in the industry. In this context, the European liberalization could serve as a model for adapting to this changing environment on a regional level so as to benefit from the opportunities provided by competition and globalization...|$|R

40|$|Collective Autonomy in the European Union’ {{explores the}} {{question}} of collective autonomy by investigating the relationship between collective bargaining and legal regulation and its current evolution in the national contexts and in the EU internal market. The thesis aims at achieving a comprehensive understanding of the notion, function and exercise of collective autonomy and collective bargaining, and it argues that collective autonomy and collective bargaining in contemporary Europe present challenges that alter their basic features. To this end, the thesis undertakes a multifaceted analysis integrating three perspectives: a theoretical perspective analysing and combining the conceptual elements of collective autonomy and collective bargaining as defined in industrial relations theories, labour law theories, and in the discourses on global labour rights; a comparative perspective analysing how collective autonomy and collective bargaining have found legal regulation in the Italian and Swedish labour law and industrial relations contexts; a cross-border perspective examining how the EU regulation of the internal market <b>freedoms</b> <b>of</b> <b>establishment</b> and to provide services impacts on the features of collective autonomy and collective bargaining. By combining elements of international, European and comparative labour law, EU internal market law, and industrial relations, this thesis explores the unique features of collective autonomy and collective bargaining as socio-economic mechanisms having a normative power, whose functioning is however influenced by legal dynamics. Eventually, it examines the transformation that the foundations of collective autonomy and collective bargaining undergo {{in relation to the}} challenges deriving from both the processes of company-level decentralisation and the dynamics of the cross-border scenarios in the EU internal market. Ultimately, the thesis contributes to advancing the understanding of the foundations of collective autonomy and to exploring its operations beyond national borders...|$|R
