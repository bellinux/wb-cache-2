We investigated {{the effects of the}} rates of pressure application and release on displacement of white spruce lumber during supercritical <b>impregnation</b> <b>with</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide.</b> Displacement was greatest when pressure was rapidly increased {{at the start of the}} process. Conversely, rapid pressure release at the conclusion of the treatment process resulted in the lowest level of permanent displacement. The results suggest that wood displacement during supercritical fluid impregnation can be controlled by altering process variables for a given species...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{activated}} carbon was prepared from kenaf fiber (KF) by using physiochemical activation method consisting of potassium hydroxide (KOH) <b>impregnation</b> <b>with</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> (CO 2) gasification. Pore structure and physical {{characteristics of the}} prepared {{activated carbon}} were determined. Adsorption studies for divalent lead (Pb) were carried out to delineate the effect of contact time, temperature, pH and initial metal ion concentration. About 93. 23 % of Pb (II) was removed from 100 mg/l solution at pH 5. 5. The experimental data followed pseudo second order kinetics which confirms chemisorptions. The linear plots of intra particle diffusion demonstrated that, the adsorption process is mainly governed by pore diffusion. The values of Langmuir dimensionless constant, R L and Freundlich constant, 1 /n were less than 1 representing favorable process for adsorption. Thermodynamic parameters such as ΔG°, ΔH° and ΔS° which are related to Gibbs free energy, enthalpy and entropy were evaluated. The research concluded that activated carbon from kenaf fiber (KFAC) has sufficient porosities and surface area and it has got good potential to remove Pb (II) from waste water. © 2011 Academic Journals...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims to {{find out}} the feasibility of preparing kenaf fiber based carbon for removal of divalent cations of Pb (II) and Cu (II) from waste water. Activated carbon was prepared by using physiochemical activation method which involves two step of potassium hydroxide <b>impregnation</b> (KOH) <b>with</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>dioxide</b> activation of the semi carbonized char. The effects of three preparation variables; temperature (500 - 700 °C), time (1 - 3 h) and Impregnation Ratio (IR) by using KOH (1 - 3) on the removal percentage of Pb (II) and Cu (II) ions were investigated by using Design of Experiment (DOE). Quadratic models were developed to correlate activated carbon preparation variables from kenaf fibers with the two responses by applying Central Composite Design (CCD). Experimental data were analysed by using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and the most influential factor on each experimental design response was identified. Process optimization was done by validating both the model to obtain maximum removal efficiency with possible maximum yield of activated carbon. © Maxwell Scientific Organization, 2012...|$|R
