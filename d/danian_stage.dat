50|$|The Malargüe Group is a {{group of}} {{geologic}} formations found in Argentina. Rocks in the Malargüe Group fall within the late Campanian to <b>Danian</b> <b>stages</b> of the Late Cretaceous Period, about 80 million to 61.7 million years in age. It overlies the older Neuquen Group.|$|R
50|$|The genus is {{predominantly}} found from Late Cretaceous strata of Maastrichtian age, {{such as the}} Hornerstown Formation, New Jersey Greensands, and Laramie Formation. New material has been found from the Rhems and Williamsburg Formations of the Black Mingo Group of the South Carolina coastal plain {{that dates back to}} the <b>Danian</b> and Thanetian <b>stages</b> of the Paleocene epoch, respectively, shows that Bottosaurus had survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event and lived through much of the early Paleogene period in these localities before finally becoming extinct somewhere around the end of the Paleocene.|$|R
40|$|An {{integrated}} magneto-, bio- and cyclostratigraphic {{framework is}} presented for the Mid-Palaeocene interval from the (hemi) pelagic sea-cliff section of Zumaia in the Basque basin. The new ∼ 55 m long studied section expands about 3. 5 Myr {{and closes the}} gap between previously published integrated studies in the section. The occurrence of magnetochron C 26 n is now documented, and its duration (complemented also by data from the Ibaeta section), and that for chrons C 26 r and C 25 r is estimated by counting precession related lithologic couplets assigned to have 21 -kyr duration (C 25 r=∼ 1449 kyr, C 26 n=∼ 231 kyr, C 26 r=∼ 2877 kyr). Consequently, the Zumaia section now provides the first complete Palaeocene astronomically derived chronology, rendering this section a master reference section. Due to limitations in the orbital calculations and uncertainties in the radiometric dating method no robust tuning and absolute ages can be given for the moment. However, the FOs (First Occurrences) of key calcareous plankton species and the Mid Palaeocene Biotic Event (MPBE) are placed within the magnetostratigraphic and cyclostratigraphic template along the studied Mid-Palaeocene interval. In addition, the dataset provides the key elements for a proper settling of the Thanetian and Selandian Global Stratotype Section and Point (GSSPs), {{which is one of}} the primary objectives of the ICS (International Commission of Stratigraphy). We consider the base of chron C 26 n and the criteria associated to the lithostratigraphic change between the Danian Limestone Fm and the Itzurun marl Fm at Zumaia, as the respective delimiting points for the Thanetian and Selandian bases as recently agreed by the Paleocene Working Group of the International Subcommission of the Paleogene Stratigraphy of the ICS. Consequently, the duration of the Thanetian, Selandian and <b>Danian</b> component <b>stages</b> can be estimated at Zumaia to be about ∼ 3129 kyr, ∼ 2163 kyr and ∼ 4324 kyr respectively (see text for error considerations). However, the MPBE located 8 precession cycles below the base of C 26 n in correspondence to a short eccentricity maxima at Zumaia, could also serve as a guiding criteria to approximate or redefine the Thanetian base if this level demonstrated synchronous...|$|R

50|$|The cliff reveals {{sections}} {{from the}} uppermost {{part of the}} Maastrichtian stage (72 to 66 million years ago) and from the lowermost part of the <b>Danian</b> <b>stage</b> (66 to 62 million years ago). A black layer of fish clay, a few centimeters thick, containing iridium clearly marks the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary. The layers {{can also be seen}} deep in the tunnels of Stevnsfortet, a cold-war fortress constructed in 1953. The bryozoa chalk in the cliff is highly shock resistant to both conventional and nuclear weapons.|$|E
50|$|Brachychampsa is an extinct genus of alligatoroid. Specimens {{have been}} found from New Mexico, Colorado, Wyoming, Montana, North and South Dakota, New Jersey, and Saskatchewan. One {{specimen}} has been found from the Darbasa Formation of Kazakhstan, although the species status is indeterminant for the fossil. The genus first appeared during the late Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous (Judithian North American stage) and became extinct during the early <b>Danian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Paleocene (Puercan North American stage), a few million years after the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event. Brachychampsa is distinguished by an enlarged fourth maxillary tooth in the upper jaw.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Ocean Drilling Program Sites 1001 A (Caribbean Sea) and 1050 C (western North Atlantic) display {{obliquity}} and precession cycles throughout polarity zone C 27 of {{the late}} <b>Danian</b> <b>stage</b> (earliest Cenozoic time). Sliding-window spectra analysis and direct cycle counting on downhole logs and high-resolution Fe variations at both sites yield the equivalent of 35 - 36 obliquity cycles. This cycle-tuned duration for polarity chron C 27 of 1. 45 Ma (applying a modern mean obliquity period of 40. 4 ka) is consistent with trends from astronomical tuning of early Danian polarity chron C 29 and 40 Ar/ 39 Ar age calibration of the Campanian-Maastrichtian magnetic polarity time scale. The cycle-tuned <b>Danian</b> <b>stage</b> (sensu Berggren et al. 1995, in SEPM Special Publications, 54, 129 - 212) spans 3. 65 Ma (65. 5 - 61. 85 Ma). Spreading rates on a reference South Atlantic synthetic profile display progressive slowing during the Maastrichtian to Danian stages, then remained relatively constant through late Palaeocene and early Eocene time...|$|E
40|$|The Boltysh {{meteorite}} impact crater {{formed in the}} Ukrainian Shield on {{the margin of the}} Tethys Ocean a few thousand years before the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary and was rapidly filled by a freshwater lake. Sediments filling the lake vary from early lacustrine turbidites and silts to 300 m of fine silts, organic carbon–rich muds, oil shales, and lamenites that record early Danian terrestrial climate signals at high temporal resolution. Combined carbon isotope and palynological data show that the fine-grained organic carbon–rich lacustrine sediments preserve a uniquely complete and detailed negative carbon isotope excursion in an expanded section of several hundred meters. The position of the carbon isotope excursion in the early <b>Danian</b> <b>stage</b> of the Paleogene period, around 200 k. y. above the Cretaceous-Paleogene boundary, leads us to correlate it to the Dan-C 2 carbon isotope excursion recorded in marine sediments of the same age. The more complete Boltysh carbon isotope excursion record indicates a δ 13 C shift of around - 3 ‰, but also a more extended recovery period, strikingly similar in pattern to the highest fidelity carbon isotope excursion records available for the Toarcian and Paleocene-Eocene hyperthermal events. Changes in floral communities through the carbon isotope excursion recorded at Boltysh reflect changing biomes caused by rapidly warming climate, followed by recovery, indicating that this early Danian hyperthermal event had a similar duration to the Toarcian and Paleocene-Eocene events. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceLocated in the French Vexin to the NW of Paris, the Vigny quarry is a geosite of {{international}} relevance, recently {{classified as a}} Regional Nature Reserve (RNR) of geological interest (in 2009). Exposing reefal and peri-reefal limestones of Palaeocene age, the site was considered by E. Desor (1846) as the co-stratotype – together with the Danish series of the Fakse quarries – of the <b>Danian</b> <b>stage.</b> Furthermore, the Vigny limestones contain the richest Danian molluscan fauna in Europe and are the only known reefal complex of Tertiary age from the Paris Basin. As a whole, the Vigny quarry exhibits various aspects of geoheritage of great scientific and educative value: stratigraphy, palaeontology, sedimentology, tectonics… Geomorphological heritage {{is one of the}} major interests of the geological nature reserve. The site is a veritable open-air museum of palaeolandforms of various types, including palaeo-fault scarps with well-conserved tectoglyphs (striation features, coatings), palaeo-submarine landslides (slumping with olistoliths of reefal limestones, debris- and mud-flows of fluidized chalk), Pleistocene palaeosols with cryoturbation features, etc. The development of lookouts and scenic vantage points along a “geomorphological” trail still increases the interest of the site for geomorphology. Protection of geomorphological heritage and other geological features was made possible by 2003 with the land acquisition by the Val d’Oise Departemental Council, which developed an exemplary strategy of conservation, management and valorization of the geoheritage (security setting, pedagogic facilities and tools, information panels, website for school education, museography, mainstream publications…). With its recent classification as a Regional Nature Reserve, this reinforces the protection status of the Vigny quarry and extends the program of conservation, management and valorization of this unique geoheritage of the Paris Basin...|$|E
