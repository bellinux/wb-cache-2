40|$|The planned new {{railway station}} in Holmestrand whose {{location}} will be inside a basalt plateau poses challenges concerning the grouting {{and water and}} frost protection. Based on <b>grouting</b> <b>works</b> in adjacent tunnels Snekkestad and Sj&# 248;skogen {{as well as the}} entrance tunnels of the station hall, a loosely attempt to predict the grouting sitatuation for the station hall will be made. Pre-construction investigations including CPTU, oedometer, piezometers and ERT tomography have hardly revealed any signs of inflows. The precipiation pattern causes seasonal fluctuations in the groundwater. Hydrologically, the Holmestrand plateau is naturally drained by the existing Holmestrand road tunnel. The Holmestrand plateau consists of column basalt and various soil masses cover its top. There exists a weakness zone that may cause problems for the station hall, meaning that grouting will have to be extensive to maintain the inflow criterion. By the aid of a formula of calculating the expected inflow for the station hall, a strict requirement emerges when comparing this to a standard double-lane railway. <b>Grouting</b> <b>works</b> will take place at an inflow criterion of 5 L/(min/(100 m)) by pre-grouting fans. Should difficult geological conditions occur, control fans, extra fans and post-grouting fans may be applied. Measuring water loss and inflow may happen, both by construction of dams in the tunnel and directly measuring the inflow from boreholes. Alternatives to grouting include concrete lining, etc. Likely water and frost protection solutions are PE foam plates, concrete elements, sprayable membranes such as the BASF masterseal 345, etc. The latter has been tested in a frost laboratory and the Geving&# 229;sen tunnel, where the most important conclusions are that the freezing index has no effect of how deep the zero-degree isotherm penetrates into the rock mass and that the temperature pattern is not cumulative. The tunnel results show no significant leakages. Also, the BASF masterseal 345 shows high deformation load capacities. Results from the grouting show highly varying trends according to the difference in geology, both when studying the distribution of grout amounts and the pressure per borehole per grouting fan and the total amounts of grout mass and the average pressure per grouting fan. In areas of the cross-section with low-quality rock the pressure seems to decrease and the amounts of grout mass increase. Also, the inflow criterion does not always control the amounts of injected mass, as the overburden and surface installations, as well as the rock mass and joint system situation play an important role. 3 D measurements giving the rock stress distribution may also serve as guidelines for the <b>grouting</b> <b>works,</b> as will the vertical joint situation of the station hall. The water and frost protection solution is likely to be either the PE foam plates or the concrete elements. The author argues that the BASF masterseal 345 shows decent qualities but requires more testing before being applied at such a project. </p...|$|R

40|$|Silica sol is a {{material}} {{that seems to}} fulfill the non-hazardous requirement of final repository and capable of penetrating into narrow fractures. The rock grouting strategy with silica sol has been studied and applied for some recent projects in Sweden. The design methodology {{is based on the}} determination of the distribution of fracture transmissivity and the theoretical penetration length. In 2008, grouting with silica sol was applied in the construction of a short tunnel at 450 m depth in the Äspö Hard Rock Laboratory (Äspö HRL), the TASS-tunnel. In 2010, a grouting experiment with silica sol was performed at a niche of 300 m depth in the Mizunami Underground Research Laboratory, the MIU- 300 -niche. Despite the fact that silica sol has been used for a couple of decades for soil consolidation or sealing of fractures, it has seldom been applied as {{a material}} for rock grouting during tunneling. The purposes of this study are: • Comparing the <b>grouting</b> <b>work</b> with silica sol in TASS-tunnel and MIU- 300 m-niche. • Investigating the applicability of the design method used in TASS-tunnel to the grouting experiment performed in MIU- 300 m-niche. • Suggesting further development of grouting techniques. It was found that although there was quite a difference in the geological conditions and grouting methods, both sites had good sealing quality results. In addition, the Swedish design method seems to be applicable to MIU- 300 m-niche even with the difference in the fracture aperture distribution in each site. Furthermore, the water inflow in a borehole at MIU- 300 m-niche has gradually decreased during the three years. One explanation for this good durability of silica sol can be that the grout penetration created a larger overlap between the boreholes than that achieved in TASS-tunnel. A large penetration length of grout minimizes the risk of erosion and/or dilution of grout, thus creating a durable sealing. It can be suggested that the Swedish method {{can be applied to the}} design and evaluation of the grouting works in Japanese rock with high intensity of fractures. Moreover, the use of Japanese silica sol or an additional overlap and pumping time might improve the grouting quality in Sweden...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: This study {{examined}} nervous system effects {{and other health}} effects in tunnel workers exposed to acrylamide and N-methylolacrylamide during tunnel work. METHODS: Symptoms and nerve conduction properties were recorded in 25 tunnel workers exposed to acrylamide and N-methylolacrylamide during grouting operations, four and 16 months after the cessation of exposure. Visual evoked response (VEP) and electroretinography (ERG) were performed 16 months post exposure. Hemoglobin adducts of acrylamide were measured and qualitative exposure indices were developed. Fifty unexposed tunnel workers served as referents. Chromosome aberrations {{and the distribution of}} Glutathion S transferase (GST) genotypes (M and T) were also examined in the 25 exposed workers, and were compared to 25 age and smoking matched referents. RESULTS: The exposed workers reported an increased prevalence of symptoms during <b>grouting</b> <b>work</b> compared to the examination after 16 months. A statistically significant reduction in mean sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) in the ulnar nerve was observed 4 months post exposure when compared to the reference group (52. 3 vs. 58. 9 m/s, p= 0. 001), and mean ulnar distal delay was prolonged (3. 1 vs 2. 5 ms, p= 0. 001). Both measures were significantly improved when measured one year later. By correlating outcome measurements with the qualitative exposure indices of the individual workers, exposure-related improvements from four to 16 months post exposure were observed both in the median nerve (motor and sensory NCV and F-response) and the ulnar nerve (sensory NCV, F-response). A significant reversible reduction in the mean sensory amplitude in the median nerve was also observed, while sensory amplitudes in the sural nerve were significantly reduced after 16 months. The amplitudes in the electroretinography on photoptic (30 Hz) stimulation were significantly lower in the exposed subjects compared to the referents. There were no clear differences in the neurophysiological outcome parameters related to GST genotypes M and T. Chromosome examinations showed {{no significant differences between the}} 25 exposed subjects and 25 of the referents for chromosome aberrations, chromatid breaks, chromosome breaks and chromosome gaps. A significant increase in chromatid gaps was observed in the exposed subjects, but no exposureresponse relationship could be found. Subjects with GSTM 1 -/GSTT 1 genotype had slightly higher frequencies of all effect parameters compared to referents with the same genotype. CONCLUSION: The results indicate slight effects on the peripheral nervous system in tunnel workers related to exposure to N-methylolacrylamide and acrylamide during grouting operations. Apart from a 3 possible delayed axonal effect on sensory fibres in the sural nerve, the effects seemed largely to have been reversible, with normalisation 16 months post exposure. A possible slight change in the ERG suggests subclinical effects on photoreceptors (cones) in the central part of the retina. The pattern of the chromosome results may indicate a possible slight genotoxic effect...|$|E
40|$|As {{concrete}} dams age, {{the need}} for remedial grouting to reduce the seepage and uplift pressure in the rock foundations under them increases. Based on {{a case study of}} a Swedish dam with very low calculated safety against sliding, this paper discusses the application of the observational method (as defined in Eurocode 7) to manage safety aspects during remedial grouting. The studied case was complex in that <b>grouting</b> <b>works</b> posed the risk of causing increased uplift pressure, which could have induced sliding failure along a shallow, persistent, horizontal rock joint in the foundation. The approach applied in the studied case mainly followed the principles of the observational method, except in some highly significant safety aspects for which alternative procedures are suggested and discussed. Implementing these procedures along with the observational method offers a coherent framework to manage the safety aspects of the remedial grouting of concrete dam foundations that is in line with modern risk-informed dam safety policies.

Due to the {{complication}} of grouting process in soil, design of fracture <b>grouting</b> <b>works</b> is still mainly based on empirical considerations and experiences from past projects.

Combined with above study, the process of fracture grouting in soil is simulated with particle flow code (PFC 2 D) from micro-viewpoint under coupling environment. In addition, the emergence and development of crack and grouting pressure in soil is analyzed under different grouting pressure and soil properties. The research results show that pressure {{plays a key role}} in consolidating the soil by fracture grouting, but in fact it should be kept in a reasonable value in order to forming grouting slurry net entirely.

40|$|The {{permeability}} of the rockmass is {{an important}} parameter for a dam. Mostly, an underground sealing is required to reduce seepage, which originates from a high permeability to an admissible amount. Further purposes of an underground sealing are to obtain sufficient stability against piping and to limit the uplift under the downstream located shell. The success of an underground sealing depends on geological conditions and technical parameters. These relations were investigated for the Bigge dam which presents an excellently documented example. The data of Lugeon tests and groutings are correlated by means of statistical measures with the geological conditions. Furthermore the long-term stability of the grout curtain is checked by {{an evaluation of the}} seepage records since impounding. At the Bigg dam, completed in 1965, the underground sealing consists of a concrete sealing up to 10 - 15 m depth in the upper weathering and disintegrated zone of the rockmass. At the bottom of the concrete sealing the accessible control gallery is integrated. From this gallery the grout curtain was drilled into the bedrock up to a maximum depth of 85 m below ground level. The results of the investigations can be summarised as follows: - By the concrete sealing in the upper section the total <b>grouting</b> <b>work</b> was considerably reduced and an optimum sealing in the critical weathering and disintegration zone was obtained. - According to the concrete sealing of the upper weathering and disintegrated zone of the rockmass the solid take of the grout curtain came to an average values of only 30 kg per running meter of borehole with extreme variations between the different sections of the grout curtain (max. in the A-row about 3800 kg/m). The water take in the Lugeon tests decreased from 4 Lugeon in the A-row (max. about 60 Lugeon), before grouting, up to 0. 45 Lugeon in the control borings, after grouting. This means a reduction of 89 %. - The average seepage through the grout curtain comes only to 4. 28 l/s. - The hydrostatic pressure in the foundation was completely lowered below the downstream shell, or it was reduced to 6 % of the upstream head, respectively. - The results indicate that effectiveness of the grout curtain was completely preserved during the 30 years of operation. The seepage is about 16 % lower than at the time of impounding in 1965. Due to these favourable results of the inspection, longer intervals of monitoring and a {{reduction in the number of}} measuring points of the current extensive monitoring system can be recommended. In addition, supplementary sealing is not necessary. (orig.)

40|$|For {{around two}} decades of {{research}} and development in the field of grouting in hard jointed rock, the design process has taken some leaps forward. Stille and Gustafson, 2005 and Funehag and Gustafson 2008, shows how a grouting design can be computed. A grouting design in hard rock can based on the penetration length of grout in rock fractures. The design comprises considerations of the fracture apertures in the rock mass, the type of grout and its rheological properties and how the grout is injected i. e pressure and grouting times. When knowing these parameters an optimized geometry fitting the design is made. Thörn, et al, 2014 describes a fundamental analysis with a comprehensive tool to retrieve the fracture distribution and aperture distribution of the fractures crossing a cored borehole. The data needed about the core is geological mapping and hydraulic section tests. In Gustafson, Claesson and Fransson, (2013) a full derivation of a radial Bingham flow in a slit is described for constant pressure. By optimizing with a specific pressure and an efficient grouting time (efficient time means the time when the pressure has reached the designed pressure) a prognosis a more realistic time consumption for grouting can be computed. However, {{the time it takes to}} reach a certain pressure is dependent on the capacity of the pump and the how large the fractures widths are. For poorly chosen pumps together with large fractures the time to reach the design pressure can be significant. The overall objective for this new formulation was to involve the grouting pressure as a variable rather than constant. A pressure build-up mimic more a realistic pumping scenario which enables better prognosis of <b>grouting</b> <b>works.</b> This paper brings up this new formulation of the radial Bingham flow with variable injection pressure in slit. The benefits of this new formulation is that it can easily be integrated in other computer programs. One program that uses this new formulation is a grouting simulator owned and developed by Edvirt AB. The simulator has been used to pedagogically demonstrate how a variable pressure and restrictions in grout flow (the pump capacity) affect the penetration length. Further, the results show that it can be used to predict suitable pump capacity to fit the coming <b>grouting</b> <b>works...</b>|$|R

Since the grouting platform was located on the mat foundation {{in the basement of}} underground parking and was under the groundwater table, a series of dewatering wells were installed before the 177 columns were constructed to prevent intrusion of the groundwater flowing upward from sandy soil to basement through grouting hole during wash boring and grouting stages from happening. Several quality control measures were undertaken prior to quality assurance testing. Two measurements of spoil return and spoil flow rate for each column were implemented. From a back analysis from the mean values of spoil density and spoil flow rate, the column diameter was estimated at around 1. 56 m, slightly smaller than the design diameter by 2. 5 %. In addition, a control chart with upper and lower control limits, established from a large dataset of flow rate of spoil return, was a means to recognize the likelihood of sand boiling and to serve as an early warning indicator of abnormal conditions for the jet <b>grouting</b> <b>works</b> below the groundwater table.

Therefore, prior to the excavation through the Lya Zone within the West Tunnel, special pre-treatment was designed to avoid time and cost consuming <b>grouting</b> <b>works</b> from the TBM. This pre-treatment concerned long-hole grouting, performed from Cross Tunnels no. 5 and 6, sealing the rock masses within specified pattern. This dissertation aims evaluation of two drilling methods used during the pre-treatment works in Lya Zone: Mudmotor and Wassara Hammer. The practical experience was gained during training period in the Hallandsås Project from September 2012 until February 2013. This knowledge was completed with studies about theoretical applying of the rock drilling methods. Two parameters were used in order to compare these two rock drilling methods: drilling time and deviation of the boreholes. Drilling time was presented from two perspectives. Firstly, the evaluation of the rate of penetration assigned to the specified sections pointed that Wassara Hammer provides much higher rate than Mudmotor. Moreover comparison of drilling time within each borehole show significant increase of drilling speed during Wassara Hammer application. The rate of performance was calculated to be almost 4 time higher for Wassara. Deviation was introduced in two different approaches as well. On the one hand, deviated boreholes were shown within particular sections, significant tendency in horizontal deviation towards left was shown. Deviation average values have been decreasing while advancing the steering proccess, however, some significant correction was observed only in case of horizontal deviation. On another hand, evaluation of the deviation within borehole GH 11 brought the assumption that the borehole’s steering did not performed exactly during Mudmotor application. Mudmotor gave a direction for further drilling, and due to this, correction of the borehole was observed during Wassara drilling. It was originally assumed that the use of these two rock drilling methods together may result in effective performance. This research attempted to evaluate Mudmotor and Wassara Hammer technologies and show the efficiency of such combination. Wassara Hammer provided fast drilling proccess while minimal deviation was possible due to the use of Mudmotor...|$|R
40|$|AbstractJinping I {{hydropower}} {{station is}} one of the most challenging projects in China due to its highest arch dam and complex geological conditions for construction. After geological investigation into the dam foundation, a few large-scale weak discontinuities are observed. The rock masses in the left dam foundation are intensively unloaded, approximately to the depth of 150 – 300 m. These serious geological defects lead to a geological asymmetry on the left and right banks, and thus some major difficulties of dam construction are encountered. In this paper, the influences of geological defects on the project are analyzed, followed by the concepts and methods of treatment design. Based on the analysis, the treatment methods of the weak rock masses and discontinuities are carefully determined, including the concrete cushion, concrete replacement grids, and consolidation <b>grouting.</b> They <b>work</b> together to enhance the strength and integrity of the dam foundation. Evaluations and calibrations through geo-mechanical model tests in combination with field monitoring results in early impoundment period show that the arch dam and its foundation are roughly stable, suggesting that the treatment designs are reasonable and effective. The proposed treatment methods and concepts in the context can be helpful for similar complex rock projects...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} I have been {{following}} 5 grouting rounds at Cyberport shaft and 4 grouting rounds at Sandy Bay shaft. There were some communication problems between the grouting team and the geologists, resulting in missing water inflow measurements. The rock quality was very poor (Q-value 0. 1 – 1), with coarse ash tuff as the most common rock mass in Cyberport, and rhyolitic tuff as the most common rock mass in Sandy Bay. The Q-values were below 1, with Cyberport just a bit higher than Sandy Bay. The rock mass was highly fractured, which was indicated by a low RQD value. Sand and silty infill was found in both shafts. Sandy bay hit a fault zone at grouting 3, with a very jointed rock at various orientations, often clay infill on joints. Micro cement with super plasticizer was the primary grouting material. Water to cement ratio 1 was mostly used. The ratio was sometimes dropped down to 0. 8 and 0. 6 after {{a certain amount of}} micro cement w/c 1 had been pumped. Polyurethane was used to block leakages. Pressure at 40 bar was mostly used as stop criteria. 5 out of 5 grouting rounds in Sandy Bay were with 40 bar as stop criteria, and 6 out of 9 in Cyberport. 60 bar pressure as stop criteria was only used twice, in round 3 a and 5 c at Cyberport. Grouting was normally stopped by overpressure, which means that the pressure exceeded 40 bar. If the stop criteria had been 60 bar, higher amounts of micro cement would most likely have been pumped into the rock mass. The drilling pattern followed a standard description mentioned in the method statement. Every contour hole was placed 1 m from each other, forming the outer circle. Ten holes were placed {{in the middle of the}} shaft. 5 m overlap between the different grouting screens was set as minimum. The water level sometimes fell to alarm level, measured from the piezometer. When this happened, grouting was immediately started to increase the water level, and it worked. Water level started increasing just hours after grouting was started. Material costs were low for both shafts. This is directly related to the small amount of material that was pumped into the rock mass. Infill of sand and silt might be the reason to this. Labour costs are roughly estimated to around 308 000 NOK per day. Delay and deviation from the planned time usage, when it comes to <b>grouting</b> <b>works,</b> will cost the project around 1 130 000 NOK, for the grouting rounds mentioned in this thesis. Sandy Bay only needed one extra grouting round, this at grouting number 2. Cyberport on the other hand, needed four extra grouting rounds, this at grouting number 3, 4 and 5. </p...|$|R
40|$|These days {{ground water}} {{lowering}} is rarely applied {{in urban areas}} as it results in settlements and thus {{as the case may}} be results in damages of the surrounding buildings. Instead of this complex civil <b>works</b> like <b>grouting</b> <b>works</b> or underwater concrete bottoms are applied. Otherwise the retaining walls have to be embedded deep enough to avoid hydraulic heave caused by the ground water flow and the vertical seepage force. For the determination of the embedded length, which is required for the safety against hydraulic heave, flow nets can be analyzed. For this purpose an iterative process is normally necessary including several 3 D ground water flow calculations. Hence, a couple of approximate solutions exist. However, these solutions are iterative itself or can lead to unsafe results as they do not consider fundamental boundary conditions. Thus within the framework of this thesis numerous ground water flow calculations have been carried out. From these calculations relations between the required embedded length and several boundary conditions have been identified. Especially the width of the construction pit B has an important influence as the required embedded length increases disproportionally for narrow construction pits. Furthermore, the position (corner, front side, long side) inside the construction pit is crucial as due to the spatial ground water flow the required embedded length is higher at the corner as at the front side or at the long side. Next dimensionless design charts have been generated based on these results. By using the design charts the required embedded length T related to the difference of the ground water table H can be determined quick and easy considering different boundary conditions (B, L, S, gamma‘, anisotropy, soil stratification) as well as the safety level according to Eurocode 7 - 1 and DIN 1054 respectively. Furthermore, it is differentiated between the corner and the front side and the long side of rectangular construction pits. In Addition investigations on the economic design of large construction pits have been carried out. By a stepping along the side walls a more economic but still safe design is possible. Finally, in addition to the design charts an approximate formula has been developed step by step. By the use of this approximate formula the required embedded length can be determined analogous to the design chart considering the different boundary condition. The influence of anisotropic as well as stratified soil can be considered by additional terms. At last a design factor was added to get an overall formula for the determination of the embedded length required for the safety against hydraulic heave in homogenous, isotropic soil. This formula can be implemented into software solutions so that the time-consuming switch over between software for the static and flow calculation becomes lapsed...|$|R
30|$|Cement based grouts {{are by far}} {{the most}} common {{materials}} used for grouting of rock. However, cement is limited by its particle size to enter very fine fractures and underperformes for strict demands on ingress to tunnels. Better penetration can be achieved by using the so called chemical grouts. Generally materials characterized as chemical grouts are polyurethane, epoxy resins, acrylamide, methacrylate and acrylate [2, 3]. Moreover, water glass and a number of composite materials such as polyurethane/water glass [4], epoxy resin/sand [5], acrylamide/sand [6], have also been used as grouting materials. Although, there is lot of experience in controlling the viscosity, achieving the desired penetration length, desired gel time and good sealing of the small cracks or pores by using organic molecules based grouts, the big issue is their toxicity, As shown by Svedrup et al. there was considerable leaching from the acrylamide based grout used in a tunnel in Norway [7]. In Sweden in the swells of environmental catastrophe involving acrylamide based grouting material in Hallandsås tunnel environmental compatibility of grouting material is highly prioritized. Silica nanoparticles are considered to be non-toxic, mainly due to their instability in groundwater, which is of utmost importance for sustainable development [8, 9]. Therefore, in rock grouting silica nanoparticle based <b>grouts</b> can <b>work</b> as alternative to the organic molecules based grouts since high penetrability can be achieved due to the small particle size.|$|R
