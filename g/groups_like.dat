5|$|An epic {{atmosphere}} {{is characteristic of}} some folk metal bands like Primordial, Moonsorrow, Turisas and the music project Folkearth. <b>Groups</b> <b>like</b> Ensiferum and Wintersun {{are known to have}} a melodious side while bands that favor a more blistering or brutal approach can be found in <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> Finntroll and Månegarm.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s, soul music was {{influenced}} by psychedelic rock and other styles. The social and political ferment of the times inspired artists like Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield to release album-length statements with hard-hitting social commentary. Artists like James Brown led soul towards more dance-oriented music, which eventually evolved into funk. Funk was typified by 1970s bands like Parliament-Funkadelic, The Meters, and James Brown himself, while more versatile <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> War, The Commodores and Earth, Wind and Fire also became popular. During the 1970s, some highly slick and commercial blue-eyed soul acts like Philadelphia's Hall & Oates achieved mainstream success, {{as well as a}} new generation of street-corner harmony or city-soul <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> The Delfonics and Howard University's Unifics.|$|E
5|$|Lead female singers are not {{uncommon}} in the genre {{and can be found}} in Cruachan, Otyg, Lumsk, Arkona and Midnattsol. Other <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> Orphaned Land and Elvenking have employed guest female vocalists in their music.|$|E

5|$|There is {{some debate}} {{as to the}} {{decompression}} requirements for helium during short-duration dives. Most divers do longer decompressions; however, some <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> the WKPP have been pioneering the use of shorter decompression times by including deep stops.|$|E
5|$|Because of its {{multitude}} of diverse, sometimes competing ethno-linguistic groups, Nigeria prior to independence {{was faced with}} sectarian tensions and violence, particularly in the oil-producing Niger Delta region, where both state and civilian forces employ varying methods of coercion in attempts gain control over regional petroleum resources. Some of the ethnic <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> the Ogoni, have experienced severe environmental degradation due to petroleum extraction.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{similarities}} in morphology and lifestyle, the slime molds (mycetozoans, plasmodiophorids, acrasids, Fonticula and labyrinthulids, now in Amoebozoa, Rhizaria, Excavata, Opisthokonta and Stramenopiles, respectively), water molds (oomycetes) and hyphochytrids (both Stramenopiles) were formerly {{classified in the}} kingdom Fungi, in <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> Mastigomycotina, Gymnomycota and Phycomycetes. The slime molds were studied also as protozoans, leading to a ambiregnal, duplicated taxonomy.|$|E
5|$|By {{the end of}} the 1980s, pop-rock largely {{consisted}} of the radio-friendly glam metal bands, who used images derived from the British glam movement with macho lyrics and attitudes, accompanied by hard rock music and heavy metal virtuosic soloing. Bands from this era included many British <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> Def Leppard, as well as heavy metal-influenced American bands Mötley Crüe, Guns N' Roses, Bon Jovi and Van Halen.|$|E
5|$|In 1905, {{with the}} {{construction}} of Collins Hall, Fordham University became the first place on the East Coast of the United States to have a theater in the round. The Penthouse Theatre, on the fourth floor of Collins Hall, served both for debuts of professional shows and home for theater <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> the Mimes and Mummers. The Penthouse Theatre was turned into office space in 1966.|$|E

5|$|Killer {{whales are}} apex predators, {{meaning that they}} {{themselves}} have no natural predators. They are sometimes called the wolves of the sea, because they hunt in <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> wolf packs. Killer whales hunt varied prey including fish, cephalopods, mammals, sea birds and sea turtles. However, different populations or ecotypes may specialize and some can have a dramatic impact on certain prey species. Specialization of prey species may be more common in whales that inhabit temperate areas due to higher food productivity.|$|E
5|$|Religious music, {{influenced}} by American gospel, {{has become an}} important part of Dominican popular music in the 1990s. Calypso has also retained much popularity in Dominica, as has Jazz. The band Impact has fused jazz with Caribbean music. Other styles include steelpan, which has declined popularity despite the efforts of <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> Dancehall.|$|E
5|$|Rock bands {{have largely}} {{influenced}} the band like the Deftones, Sepultura, Sick of It All, and Snapcase. At an early age, Schwab listened to Slayer, S.O.D., and Metallica. He later discovered East Coast hip hop. During {{the recording of}} Rival Factions, the band took heavy influence from post-punk <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> Depeche Mode, Joy Division, Psychedelic Furs, and The Sisters of Mercy. Some of their favorite bands are The Cure, Portishead, Quicksand, Shiner, and Sunny Day Real Estate.|$|E

5|$|The ONA {{believe that}} there are {{historical}} precedents to their practice of human sacrifice, expressing belief in a prehistoric tradition in which humans were sacrificed to a goddess named Baphomet at the spring equinox and to the Arcturus star in the autumn. However, the ONA's advocacy of human sacrifice has drawn strong criticism from other Satanist <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> the Temple of Set, who deem it to be detrimental to their own attempts to make Satanism more socially acceptable within Western nations.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Amanita nothofagi grow solitarily or in {{scattered}} <b>groups.</b> <b>Like</b> all Amanita mushrooms, it is mycorrhizal, and grows in close association with Southern Beech (genus Nothofagus) (including New Zealand Red Beech, Silver beech, New Zealand Black Beech, and Hard Beech), Manuka, and Kānuka. Found {{on both the}} North and South islands of New Zealand, {{it is the most}} common of the country's endemic Amanita species.|$|E
5|$|UCSC {{is home to}} few fraternities and sororities. The first Greek {{organization}} on campus, Theta Chi, {{was given}} colony status on January 10, 1987 and chartered on October 14, 1989 (designation: Theta Iota). In the beginning, fraternities like Theta Chi and Sigma Alpha Epsilon were met with strong opposition from the student body. Student <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> P.A.C. (People's Alternative Community), S.A.G.E. (Students Against Greek Environments), and M.A.C. (Men's Alternative Community) protested the existence of Greek life at the UCSC campus.|$|E

5|$|All these bands {{played a}} part in {{developing}} the overall look and sound of glam metal during the early 1980s. In 1985, many more commercially successful glam metal albums began to appear. Mötley Crüe released Theatre of Pain, Ratt's second album Invasion of Your Privacy, Dokken's third album Under Lock and Key, Stryper's first release Soldiers Under Command, Bon Jovi's second release 7800° Fahrenheit, and Autograph's second album That's The Stuff. Los Angeles continued to foster the most important scene around the Sunset Strip, with <b>groups</b> <b>like</b> London, which had originally formed as a glam rock band in the 1970s, and had seen future members of Mötley Crüe, Cinderella and Guns N' Roses pass through its ranks, finally releasing their début album Non Stop Rock in 1985 as well.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{complexity}} of the crown, Goin and colleagues identified the tooth as a mammal; although some non-mammalian <b>groups,</b> <b>like</b> crocodylians, may have complex teeth, none approach the level of complexity seen in LACM 149371. They could find no resemblance to australosphenidans including monotremes, metatherians including marsupials, xenarthrans, and some related groups. They did see some general resemblances to the upper premolars of the early South American ungulates, but the cusp arrangement is different from that of any ungulate. There are also some resemblances to the early rodents Ivanantonia from Asia and Nonomys from North America, but Ivanantonia has a central groove and lacks fossae, and Nonomys has a prominent cingulum (shelf) {{at the edges of the}} tooth and also lacks the fossae of LACM 149371.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the start}} of the colonial period, the region of South Kasai formed part of the Luba Empire, a {{federation}} of local kingdoms with a degree of cultural uniformity. During the 17th and 18th centuries, the Baluba spread across large parts of the Kasai-Katanga savannah along the Kasai river basin and eventually developed into a number of ethnic subgroups, notably the Luba-Kasai and the Luba-Katanga. Although never united into a single centralised state, the groups retained a degree of emotional attachment based around shared origin myths and cultural practices. Other <b>groups,</b> <b>like</b> the Songye and the Kanyok, also had long histories in the Kasai region.|$|E

50|$|Participants in {{one study}} were asked to imagine that {{they were at the}} beach and in the mood for ice cream. One set of {{participants}} was asked to evaluate the value of 8 ounces of ice cream sold in a 10-ounce cup; another, to evaluate 7 ounces in a 5-ounce cup; a third, to compare the two. The second <b>group</b> <b>liked</b> their overfilled cups more than the first <b>group</b> <b>liked</b> their underfilled cups; but the third group, when presented with both options, recognized that the larger portion was more valuable than the smaller one.|$|R
