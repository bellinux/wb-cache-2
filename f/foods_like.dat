Often many restaurants customize fusion dishes which blends foreign and local cuisines to meet local taste. Local and international fast food shops and chains serve burgers, fries and other readily available foods.

Chita Pitha/ছিটা পিঠা & Bhapha Pitha/ভাপা পিঠা, {{a type of}} easy cake, made from rice flour also popular as street food.|$|E
5|$|Biotechnology in {{the general}} sense has been an {{important}} part of biology since the late 19th century. With the industrialization of brewing and agriculture, chemists and biologists became aware of the great potential of human-controlled biological processes. In particular, fermentation proved a great boon to chemical industries. By the early 1970s, a wide range of biotechnologies were being developed, from drugs like penicillin and steroids to <b>foods</b> <b>like</b> Chlorella and single-cell protein to gasohol—as well as a wide range of hybrid high-yield crops and agricultural technologies, the basis for the Green Revolution.|$|E
5|$|English cookery {{has been}} open to foreign {{ingredients}} and influence from {{as early as}} the thirteenth century, {{and in the case of}} a few <b>foods</b> <b>like</b> sausages from Roman times. The Countess of Leicester, daughter of King John purchased large amounts of cinnamon, while King Edward I ordered large quantities of spices such as pepper and ginger, as well as of what was then an expensive imported luxury, sugar. Dickson Wright refutes the popular idea that spices were used to disguise bad meat, pointing out that this would have been as fatal then as it would be today. She suggests instead that spices were used to hide the taste of salt, which was used to preserve food in the absence of refrigeration.|$|E
40|$|This {{cross-sectional}} study investigated how parents and friends influence adolescents’ <b>food</b> <b>likes</b> and consumption. 709 adolescent-parent and 638 adolescent-friend dyads completed a questionnaire, {{allowing us to}} compare target-parent and target-friend resemblances both on <b>food</b> <b>likes</b> and consumption, while distinguishing between cultural influence and dyadic unique influence. In addition, we identified two psychosocial predictors of resemblance, namely parenting style and adolescents' self-monitoring. As expected, results indicated that authoritative parenting style increased target-parent resemblance in <b>food</b> <b>likes</b> (directly) and consumption (indirectly), and self-monitoring orientation increased target-friend resemblance in <b>food</b> <b>likes</b> (directly) and consumption (indirectly). We also showed that target-friend resemblance was more culture-based than target-parent resemblance, suggesting that parental influence is more specific to the dyadic relation than is peer influence...|$|R
40|$|The elderly {{population}} is rapidly growing worldwide. In sensory and nutrition research, age-associated losses in sensory function {{are believed to}} change the perception of food, to decrease <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> and consequently to decrease food intake of the elderly, although data {{in support of this}} line of assumptions are currently scarce. Consequently, there is a growing need to understand more about age related changes both in food perception and <b>food</b> <b>liking.</b> Therefore, the present thesis describes research on <b>food</b> perception, <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> and sensory acuity with increasing age. The results demonstrate that the elderly indeed perceive foods differently compared to the young, mainly as less intense in flavour and in creaminess/fattiness. However, their <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> is not reduced, despite these age-related changes in perception. It is concluded that decreased sensory acuity, although causing losses in perception of the elderly, is obviously not causing a reduced <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> and thus may not be the predominant reason for a diminished food intake...|$|R

5|$|The kōata, {{the growing}} {{tip of the}} plant, was eaten raw as medicine. When cooked, {{it was called the}} kōuka. If the spike of unopened leaves and a few outer leaves is gripped firmly at the base and bent, it will snap off. The leaves can be removed, and what remains is like a small {{artichoke}} heart that can be steamed, roasted or boiled to make kōuka, a bitter vegetable available at any time of the year. Kōuka is delicious as a relish with fatty <b>foods</b> <b>like</b> eel, muttonbirds, or pigeons, or in modern times, pork, mutton and beef. Different trees were selected for their degree of bitterness, which should be strong for medicinal use, but less so when used as a vegetable.|$|E
5|$|After the {{development}} of larger and faster-growing hogs (due to crosses between European and Asian breeds) in the 18th and 19th century in the United States, backyard and small-scale hog production provided an inexpensive means of converting waste food, crop waste, and garbage into calories (in a relatively small space and {{in a relatively short}} period of time). Many of those calories came in the form of fat and rendered lard. Lard was used for almost all cooking and was a fundamental component in many common homestead foods (many that today are still regarded as holiday and comfort <b>foods)</b> <b>like</b> biscuits and pies. The economic/caloric necessity of consuming lard and other saved fats may have led to the popularity of fried foods, not only in the US, but worldwide. In the 19th century cast iron became widely available for use in cooking. The combination of flour, lard, a chicken and a heavy pan placed over a relatively controllable flame became the beginning of today's fried chicken.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Low {{inhibitory}} {{control and}} strong hedonic response towards food {{are considered to}} contribute to overeating and obesity. Based on previous research, the present study aimed at examining the potentially crucial interplay between these two factors in terms of long-term weight loss in people with obesity. Methods: BMI, inhibitory control towards <b>food,</b> and <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> were assessed in obese adults prior to a weight reduction programme (OPTIFAST® 52). After the weight reduction phase (week 13) and the weight loss maintenance phase (week 52), participants' BMI was re-assessed. Results: Baseline BMI, inhibitory control and <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> alone did not predict weight loss. As hypothesised, however, inhibitory control and <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> interactively predicted weight loss from baseline to week 13 and to week 52 (albeit the latter effect was less robust). Participants with low inhibitory control and marked <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> were less successful in weight reduction. Conclusion: These findings underscore {{the relevance of the}} interplay between cognitive control and food reward valuation in the maintenance of obesity...|$|R

25|$|The Three Kingdoms period (57 BCE– 668 CE) was one {{of rapid}} {{cultural}} evolution. The kingdom of Goguryeo (37 BCE– 668 CE) was located {{in the northern part}} of the peninsula along much of modern-day Manchuria. The second kingdom, Baekje (18 BCE– 660 CE), was in the southwestern portion of the peninsula, and the third, Silla (57 BCE– 935 CE), was located at the southeastern portion of the peninsula. Each region had its own distinct set of cultural practices and foods. For example, Baekje was known for cold foods and fermented <b>foods</b> <b>like</b> kimchi. The spread of Buddhism and Confucianism through cultural exchanges with China during the fourth century CE began to change the distinct cultures of Korea.|$|E

25|$|Compared to liquid water, {{microwave}} heating is less efficient on fats and sugars (which have a smaller molecular dipole moment). Sugars and triglycerides (fats and oils) absorb microwaves {{due to the}} dipole moments of their hydroxyl groups or ester groups. However, due to the lower specific heat capacity of fats and oils and their higher vaporization temperature, they often attain much higher temperatures inside microwave ovens. This can induce temperatures in oil or very fatty <b>foods</b> <b>like</b> bacon far above the boiling point of water, and high enough to induce some browning reactions, much {{in the manner of}} conventional , braising, or deep fat frying. Foods high in water content and with little oil rarely exceed the boiling temperature of water.|$|E
25|$|Some of Guatemala's main {{exports are}} fruits, vegetables, flowers, handicrafts, cloths and others. In {{the face of}} a rising demand for biofuels, the country is growing and {{exporting}} an increasing amount of raw materials for biofuel production, especially sugar cane and palm oil. Critics say that this development leads to higher prices of staple <b>foods</b> <b>like</b> corn, a major ingredient in the Guatemalan diet. As a consequence of the subsidization of US American corn, Guatemala imports nearly half of its corn from the United States that is using 40 percent of its crop harvest for biofuel production. The government is considering ways to legalize poppy and marijuana production, hoping to tax production and use tax revenues to fund drug prevention programs and other social projects.|$|E
25|$|It is {{customary}} to eat rice to {{the last}} grain. Being a picky eater is frowned upon, {{and it is not}} customary to ask for special requests or substitutions at restaurants. It is considered ungrateful to make these requests especially in circumstances where one is being hosted, as in a business dinner environment. After eating, try to move all dishes back to the same position they were {{at the start of the}} meal. This includes replacing the lids on dishes and putting one's chopsticks on the chopstick holder or back into their paper slip. Good manners dictate that one respects the selections of the host.

40|$|Differences between elderly {{subjects}} (n= 52, 60 ¿ 85 years) {{and young}} subjects (n= 55, 18 ¿ 35) in their <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> and their olfactory capability were investigated. Two food systems were used: custard desserts and tomato drinks. Flavor enhancement/enrichment, textural change, and/or irritant addition were incorporated as compensatory strategies into these foods. The addition of low concentrations of both cherry flavor and cream flavor to the custard desserts influenced their pleasantness {{for the majority}} of the elderly. The addition of cream topping increased the pleasantness of the custard desserts for both the elderly and the young. The elderly equally liked the tomato drinks with no or with low irritant addition, whereas the young generally disliked an irritant addition. However, the <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> of the elderly was not generally increased by these different compensatory strategies. Instead, subgroups were observed for each compensatory strategy, in which applied compensatory strategies led to an increase in product pleasantness. Age-associated losses in olfactory capabilities did not sufficiently explain differences in <b>food</b> <b>liking,</b> as only elderly with similar olfactory capabilities to the young demonstrated a liking of enhanced flavor. The present study does not support the assumption that age-associated impairment in olfactory capability will inevitably lead to changes in <b>food</b> <b>liking...</b>|$|R
40|$|Taste {{is one of}} {{the main}} factors {{determining}} food choices. Differences in PROP bitter taste perception have been implicated in individual differences in food preferences and selection. The present study examined associations between, PROP phenotypes, self-reported <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> and TAS 2 R 38 polymorphisms, the major gene implicated in PROP bitterness, in six different populations of the Caucasus and Central Asia, located along the ancient Silk Road. Differences in the distribution of PROP phenotypes across populations were detected, with a higher frequency of super tasters in Tajikistan (31. 3 %) and Armenia (39. 0 %) and a higher frequency of non tasters in Georgia (50. 9 %). While no relationships were observed between PROP phenotypes and <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> using standard statistical tests, we used an approach based on comparison of distance matrices derived from these data. The first matrix compared the <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> ratings of each population to all others pairwise using the Kruskal-Wallis test (at p, 0. 00063), and the second one compared the distribution of PROP phenotypes across all populations in a similar manner calculating the chi-square statistic as a distance measure. A strong correlation between the two matrices was found (Mantel test: r = 0. 67, p-value = 0. 03), suggesting that the pattern of <b>food</b> <b>liking</b> across populations was closely related to the distribution of PROP phenotypes. This same relationship was not observed when TAS 2 R 38 genotypes were substituted for PROP phenotypes in this analysis.
