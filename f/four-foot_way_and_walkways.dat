50|$|De Burghs {{bridge is}} an {{important}} part of a significant north-south artery which is the next road between the Northern Suburbs and the lower Northern Suburbs after Pennant Hills Road. The bridge carries three lanes of traffic each <b>way</b> <b>and</b> a pedestrian <b>walkway</b> on either side of the bridge. A plaque placed on the bridge pays tribute to the old bridge. It was placed there in 1988 before the destruction of the old bridge.|$|R
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the highway design process, a temporary arts program was initiated, and over 50 proposals were selected. However, development began on only a few projects before funding for the program was cut. Permanent public art that was funded includes: super graphic text and facades of former West End houses cast into the concrete elevated highway abutment support walls near North Station by artist Sheila Levrant de Bretteville; Harbor Fog, a sensor-activated mist, light and sound sculptural environment by artist Ross Miller in parcel 17; an historical sculpture celebrating the 18th and 19th century shipbuilding industry and a bust of shipbuilder Donald McKay in East Boston; blue interior lighting of the Zakim Bridge; and the Miller's River Littoral <b>Way</b> <b>walkway</b> <b>and</b> lighting under the loop ramps north of the Charles River.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a real-time database modeling complex networks of intersecting roads <b>and</b> <b>walkways</b> in urban virtual environments. The database represents {{information about the}} layout of streets and sidewalks, the rules that govern behavior on roads <b>and</b> <b>walkways,</b> <b>and</b> the locations of agents with respect to road and sidewalk structures. This information is used by programs that control the behavior of autonomous vehicles and pedestrians populating the virtual urban environment. Roads and sidewalks are modeled as ribbons in space. The ribbon structure provides a natural coordinate frame for defining the local geometry of navigable surfaces. This geometry is important for <b>way</b> finding <b>and</b> also forms the geometric basis on which spatial relationships among agents are defined. The database includes a powerful run-time interface supported by robust and efficient code for locating objects on the ribbon network, for mapping between Cartesian and ribbon coordinates, and for determining behavioral constraints imposed by the environment...|$|R
