5|$|Hill {{represented}} Williams {{alone at}} the next race, the Monaco Grand Prix. His race ended early in a collision involving several cars on the opening lap of the race. For the following race, the Spanish Grand Prix, Williams' test driver David Coulthard was promoted to the race team alongside Hill, who won the race just four weeks after Senna's death. Twenty-six years earlier Graham Hill had won in Spain under similar circumstances for Lotus {{after the death of}} his team-mate Jim Clark. Championship leader Schumacher finished second with a gearbox fault restricting him to <b>fifth</b> <b>gear,</b> having led the early laps.|$|E
5|$|In {{the second}} {{practice}} session, Alonso set the fastest lap {{of the day}} with a time of 1:39.283; Red Bull drivers Vettel and Webber finished with the second and third-fastest times. Rosberg was fourth, ahead of Hamilton and Kubica. Massa, Adrian Sutil, Button and Barrichello followed in the top-ten. Massa caused the session to be disrupted after spinning in the fourth corner and narrowly avoided making contact with the barrier. The session was red-flagged to allow Massa's car to be removed from the centre of the track to be taken to the pit lane. Timo Glock's lost the use of his car's <b>fifth</b> <b>gear</b> and pulled {{over to the side of}} the track at turn twelve which prematurely ended his running. Vitaly Petrov spun at the exit of turn 14 and reversed his car to rejoin the circuit, avoiding the need for a red-flag. Vettel was the fastest driver in the final practice session with a lap of 1:38.052; Webber was third-fastest. Kubica separated the two Red Bull drivers in second, with Sutil fourth. Alonso was fifth-fastest, and Barrichello was sixth. Vitantonio Liuzzi, Massa, Button and Hamilton rounded out the top ten.|$|E
25|$|Having had {{previous}} {{success with}} turbocharging Fiat Spiders, DeLorean {{entered into a}} contract with Legend Industries, based in Hauppauge, New York. DMC wanted to increase power without sacrificing fuel economy. DMC wanted a wide power band {{and did not want}} a surge of power similar to the Porsche 930 Turbo. Legend used twin IHI RHB52 turbos along with twin intercoolers. The results were an engine capable of accelerating smoothly in <b>fifth</b> <b>gear</b> from 1,500rpm to full turbo boost at 2,500rpm reaching 150mph at 6,500rpm.|$|E

25|$|Tested at 9.7 {{seconds to}} 100km/h for the manual model, {{it is more}} than half a second slower than its predecessor. This is likely on account of its weight, a hefty 1300kg, which is curiously more than the Civic unlike before wherein it was usually lighter. The {{automatic}} also has widely spaced ratios {{due to the lack of}} a <b>fifth</b> <b>gear,</b> giving sluggish acceleration, definitely not maximizing the engine potential. The Toyota Corolla received a 4 star ANCAP safety rating for occupant safety and a 3 star rating for pedestrian safety.|$|E
25|$|The track {{underwent}} a major redesign between the 1990 and 1991 races, transforming the ultra-fast track (where {{in its last}} years every corner was taken in no lower than fourth or <b>fifth</b> <b>gear,</b> depending on the transmission of the car, except for the Bridge chicane, which was usually taken in second gear) into a more technical track. The reshaped track's first F1 race {{was perhaps the most}} memorable of recent years, with Nigel Mansell coming home first in front of his home crowd. On his victory lap back to the pits Mansell even found time to pick up stranded rival Ayrton Senna and give him a lift on his side-pod after Senna's McLaren had run out of fuel on the final lap of the race.|$|E
25|$|At {{the next}} round at Donington, Yoong ended up {{starting}} fifth and drove arguably the best race of his career. During the race that caused unpredictable conditions and other competitors spinning out, Yoong ended up second at midpoint, two seconds behind leader Werner Lupberger, and the pair pulled out a 22-second gap over the entire field. With the deployment of the safety car to clear several cars who had retired, Yoong was unable to see the safety car's lights in the spray. This mistake led to him being eight seconds behind Lupberger, but Yoong set five consecutive fastest laps to catch up. Later in the race, {{while he was in}} <b>fifth</b> <b>gear</b> at 220kph, he aquaplaned and spun after hitting a puddle. But, Yoong miraculously recovered and once again closed on Lupberger. In the end, he finished second, 1.217s behind Lupberger.|$|E

25|$|The GT-R has {{frequently}} featured in {{head to head}} track comparisons against competing vehicles conducted by the automotive press. <b>Fifth</b> <b>Gear</b> tested the GT-R along with the Mitsubishi Evo FQ 400 in their short autototest agility track and their larger test track. The GT-R was a second quicker than the Evo in terms of speed {0-60} but the Evo proved to handle better than the GT-R on the autotest track. On the larger track the GT-R was 3 seconds a lap quicker than the Evo FQ 400. Autocar performed several head to head comparisons involving the GT-R and competing vehicles. In the first, against the Porsche 911 GT3 and BMW M3, the GT-R was declared to be faster around the test track. A second test on the Isle of Man on a 4.5km closed public road, featured with the Audi R8, Lotus Elise, and Lamborghini Gallardo LP560-4. The GT-R's time of 1:56.69 was behind the Gallardo's 1:55.99 time, however, because the GT-R was Japanese-spec, its top speed was limited to 112mph, which led the journalists to believe it could have performed better. In CAR Magazine's test with the 911 Turbo, BMW M3, and Audi R8 at Rockingham the GT-R was the fastest. Evo tested the GT-R alongside the 911 GT3 at the Bedford Autodrome circuit, the GT-R ran a 1:21.7 lap time compared to GT3's 1:22.6 time. In a <b>Fifth</b> <b>Gear</b> test with the 911 Turbo, Bruno Senna was able to achieve faster lap times in the GT-R. Car and Driver compared the GT-R on Reno-Fernley Raceway with the 911 Turbo and BMW M3, the GT-R's lap time of 1:26.7 made it the fastest on the track. Road & Track was able to achieve quick lap times with the car on Buttonwillow Raceway, clocking in at 1:56.9 which was over 5 seconds faster than the Chevrolet Corvette C6 Z06 and 911 Turbo. In an Edmunds.com 6-way test on the Streets of Willow and an improvised mountain road, the GT-R posted faster times than the Audi R8 and Porsche 911 Carrera. Auto Bild compared the GT-R with the 911 Turbo and V10 Audi R8 at Contidrome, the GT-R's time of 1:30.95 placed it ahead of both the Porsche 911 (1:31.75) and the Audi R8 (1:32.11).|$|E
25|$|At the start, Alesi got {{ahead of}} both Barrichello and Lehto with Coulthard {{getting ahead of}} Barrichello as well. Schumacher led Hill, Häkkinen, Alesi, Lehto and Coulthard into lap 2. Schumacher pulled away until he began to have gear {{selection}} problems and was stuck in <b>fifth</b> <b>gear.</b> During the stops, Schumacher amazingly was able to pull away without stalling. Behind, there was action in the pits as Coulthard stalled and Alesi had troubles, dropping down four places. Schumacher, still in the lead, was struggling and was passed by Hill. During {{the second round of}} pit stops, Barrichello spun off near the pit entry and Schumacher was once again able to make a pitstop and not stall the car. Häkkinen was right with him but did not have a chance to attack as his engine failed on lap 49. Lehto took up third, but his engine failed as well five laps later. Brundle took the place, but his transmission failed spectacularly with six laps to go. Hill won from Schumacher who was a superb second in the circumstances, Blundell, Alesi, Pierluigi Martini and Irvine.|$|E

He passed Jochen Mass on lap 45, and Jarier on lap 46 to take over fourth place. With 20 laps to go, Lauda was having trouble selecting gears and {{decided to try to}} nurse the car home rather than make a run at Regazzoni. Jarier had dropped to sixth behind Mass, also with gearbox trouble. Then, on the next to last lap, with only first and <b>fifth</b> <b>gears</b> left, he was also overtaken by Fittipaldi, who scored the first Championship point for his own Copersucar team.|$|R
500|$|Da Matta {{appeared}} in victory lane {{and later on}} the podium to celebrate his third win of the season; the victory earned him $1 million. He was happy with the result: [...] "I was pretty confident {{in the car and}} could go flat down to the end. You need to be a little lucky, being {{in the right place at}} the right time. For everybody, it's a very exciting race. We were racing all together all the time."

500|$|The Benetton and Williams {{teams were}} {{employing}} different pit stop strategies – the Benetton team were planning a threestop strategy whereas the Williams team were only planning for twostops. Schumacher made a pit stop on lap18, but was momentarily baulked by the slowing Jordan car of Barrichello {{as he was}} entering the pitlane. Schumacher exited the stop behind Berger, but overtook the Austrian driver {{at the beginning of}} the next lap. Hill, who had remained close behind Schumacher before the German made a pit stop, made his own stop on lap21, exiting the pitlane in front of Schumacher. Coulthard took the lead of the race for one lap, before pitting and dropping behind the two leaders and the yet-to-stop Häkkinen and Berger. Häkkinen and Berger were the final drivers of the leading teams to pit, however, the McLaren mechanics had trouble getting the fuel hose off the Finn's car when he stopped on lap23, losing him tenseconds. Several other teams experienced problems with attaching and detaching the refuelling nozzles, and occasional small sprays of fuel were observed, reinforcing the problem experienced by McLaren with the equipment before the race meeting. Berger, adopting a strategy of pitting late, was the only driver not to have stopped by lap24 and thus was third, with Hill, Schumacher, Coulthard, Alesi and Salo the other drivers in the top six places. Salo's stop had been faultless, gaining him significant time on those drivers who had been running in front of him. By this stage Gachot had retired his Pacific car after it got stuck in <b>fifth</b> <b>gear.</b> Berger made his stop on lap 27, but had problems leaving the pit lane after a communication problem between him and his mechanics nearly led to him leaving the pit lane with a loose wheel nut on the front right-hand wheel. The pit [...] "lollipop", signalling the driver when to leave, was raised and lowered again in quick succession, preventing Berger from leaving until the wheel nut was sufficiently tightened. The miscommunication cost Berger 13seconds, dropping him back to seventhposition. Alesi fell behind Salo and Häkkinen after the firstset of pitstops, Salo overtaking him on lap25, with Häkkinen moving past threelaps later as Alesi was held up behind the lapped Montermini.|$|E
500|$|Schumacher won six of {{the first}} seven races and was leading the , before a gearbox failure left him stuck in <b>fifth</b> <b>gear.</b> Schumacher {{finished}} the race in second place. Following the San Marino Grand Prix, the Benetton, Ferrari and McLaren teams were investigated on suspicion of breaking the FIA-imposed ban on electronic aids. Benetton and McLaren initially refused to hand over their source code for investigation. When they did so, the FIA discovered hidden functionality in both teams' software, but no evidence {{that it had been}} used in a race. Both teams were fined $100,000 for their initial refusal to cooperate. However, the McLaren software, which was a gearbox program that allowed automatic shifts, was deemed legal. By contrast, the Benetton software was deemed to be a form of [...] "launch control" [...] that would have allowed Schumacher to make perfect starts, which was explicitly outlawed by the regulations. However, there was no evidence to suggest that this software was actually used. [...] At the , Schumacher was penalised for overtaking on the formation lap. He then ignored the penalty and the subsequent black flag, which indicates that the driver must immediately return to the pits, for which he was disqualified and later given a two-race ban. Benetton blamed the incident on a communication error between the stewards and the team. Schumacher was also disqualified after winning the [...] after his car was found to have illegal wear on its skidblock, a measure used after the accidents at Imola to limit downforce and hence cornering speed. Benetton protested that the skidblock had been damaged when Schumacher spun over a kerb, but the FIA rejected their appeal because of the pattern of wear and damage visible on the block. These incidents helped Damon Hill close the points gap, and Schumacher led by a single point going into the final race in Australia. On lap 36 Schumacher hit the guardrail {{on the outside of the}} track while leading. Hill attempted to pass, but as Schumacher's car returned to the track there was a collision on the corner causing them both to retire. As a result, Schumacher won a very controversial championship, the first German to do so (Jochen Rindt raced under the Austrian flag). At the FIA conference after the race, the new World Champion dedicated his title to Ayrton Senna.|$|E
