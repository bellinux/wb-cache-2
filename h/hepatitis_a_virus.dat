5|$|The {{second most}} studied triad is the Cysteine-Histidine-Aspartate motif. Several {{families}} of cysteine proteases use this triad set, for example TEV protease and papain. The triad acts similarly to serine protease triads, {{with a few}} notable differences. Due to cysteine's low pKa, {{the importance of the}} Asp to catalysis varies and several cysteine proteases are effectively Cys-His dyads (e.g. <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>virus</b> protease), whilst in others the cysteine is already deprotonated before catalysis begins (e.g. papain). This triad is also used by some amidases, such as N-glycanase to hydrolyse non-peptide C-N bonds.|$|E
5|$|The acidic triad member forms a {{hydrogen}} {{bond with the}} basic residue. This aligns the basic residue by restricting its side-chain rotation, and polarises it by stabilising its positive charge. Two amino acids have acidic side chains at physiological pH (aspartate or glutamate) {{and so are the}} most commonly used for this triad member. Cytomegalovirus protease uses a pair of histidines, one as the base, as usual, and one as the acid. The second histidine is not as effective an acid as the more common aspartate or glutamate, leading to a lower catalytic efficiency. In some enzymes, the acid member of the triad is less necessary and some act only as a dyad. For example, papain uses asparagine as its third triad member which orients the histidine base but does not act as an acid. Similarly, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>virus</b> protease contains an ordered water in the position where an acid residue should be.|$|E

The consumption of raw oysters has been repeatedly linked to outbreaks of viral gastroenteritis and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A.</b> Switzerland imports over 300 tons of oysters per year, 95 % of which originate in France. To assess the level of viral contamination, a 3 -month monitoring study was conducted. Therefore, the sensitivities of several previously described methods for virus concentration were compared, and one protocol was finally chosen by using dissected digestive tissues. Eighty-seven samples consisting of five oysters each were analyzed for Norwalk-like viruses (NLVs), enteroviruses, and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> from November 2001 to February 2002. The oysters were exported by 31 French, three Dutch, and two Irish suppliers. Eight oyster samples from six French suppliers were positive for NLVs, and four samples from four French suppliers were positive for enteroviruses; two of the latter samples were positive for both viral agents. No <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>viruses</b> were detected. The sequences of NLV and enterovirus amplicons showed a great variety of strains, especially for the NLVs (strains similar to Bristol, Hawaii, Mexico, and Melksham agent). The data obtained indicated that imported oysters might be a source of NLV infection in Switzerland. However, further studies are needed to determine the quantitative significance of the risk factor within the overall epidemiology of NLVs...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{microbial}} water quality in canal waters throughout the Florida Keys, a survey was conducted to determine the concentration of microbial fecal indicators {{and the presence of}} human pathogenic microorganisms. A total of 19 sites, including 17 canal sites and 2 nearshore water sites, were assayed for total coliforms, fecal coliforms, Escherichia coli, Clostridium perfringens, enterococci, coliphages, F-specific (F+) RNA coliphages, Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium parvum, and human enteric <b>viruses</b> (polioviruses, coxsackie <b>A</b> and B <b>viruses,</b> echoviruses, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>viruses,</b> Norwalk viruses, and small round-structured viruses). Numbers of coliforms ranged from < 1 to 1, 410, E. coli organisms from < 1 to 130, Clostridium spp. from < 1 to 520, and enterococci from < 1 to 800 CFU/ 100 ml of sample. Two sites were positive for coliphages, but no F+ phages were identified. The sites were ranked according to microbial water quality and compared to various water quality standards and guidelines. Seventy-nine percent of the sites were positive for the presence of enteroviruses by reverse transcriptase PCR (polioviruses, coxsackie <b>A</b> and B <b>viruses,</b> and echoviruses).

500|$|Hepatitis is {{a disease}} of the liver that has been {{recognised}} since antiquity. [...] Symptoms include jaundice, a yellowing of the skin, eyes and body fluids. [...] There are numerous causes, including viruses– particularly <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>virus,</b> hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus. [...] Throughout history epidemics of jaundice have been reported, mainly affecting soldiers at war. This [...] "campaign jaundice" [...] was common in the Middle Ages. It occurred among Napoleon's armies and {{during most of the}} major conflicts of the 19th and 20th centuries, including the American Civil War, where over 40,000 cases and around 150 deaths were reported. The viruses that cause epidemic jaundice were not discovered until the middle of the 20th century. The names for epidemic jaundice, hepatitis A, and for blood-borne infectious jaundice, hepatitis B, were first used in 1947, following a publication in 1946 giving evidence that the two diseases were distinct. In the 1960s, the first virus [...] that could cause hepatitis was discovered.

2500|$|The largest {{outbreak}} of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>virus</b> in United States history occurred {{among people who}} ate at a now defunct Mexican food restaurant located in Monaca, Pennsylvania in late 2003. Over 550 people who visited the restaurant between September and October 2003 were infected with the virus, three of whom died as a direct result. The outbreak {{was brought to the}} attention of health officials when local emergency medicine physicians noticed a significant increase in [...] cases of hepatitis A in the county. After conducting its investigation, the CDC attributed the source of the outbreak to the use of contaminated raw green onion. The restaurant was purchasing its green onion stock from farms in Mexico at the time. It is believed that the green onions may have been contaminated through the use of contaminated water for crop irrigation, rinsing, or icing or by handling of the vegetables by infected individuals. Green onion had caused similar outbreaks of hepatitis A in the southern United States prior to this, but not to the same magnitude. The CDC believes that the restaurant's use of a large communal bucket for chopped raw green onion allowed non-contaminated plants to be mixed with contaminated ones, increasing the number of vectors of infection and amplifying the outbreak. The restaurant was closed once it was discovered to be the source, and over 9,000 people were given hepatitis A immune globulin because they had either eaten at the restaurant or had been in close contact with someone who had.|$|E

With the relatively recent emergence of molecular biology-based assays, {{a number of}} investigations have shown that pathogenic viruses are prevalent in marine waters being impacted by sewage. Research has shown that this group of fecal-oral viral pathogens (enteroviruses, <b>hepatitis</b> <b>A</b> <b>viruses,</b> Norwalk viruses, reoviruses, adenoviruses, rotaviruses, etc.) can cause {{a broad range of}} asymptomatic to severe gastrointestinal, respiratory, and eye, nose, ear, and skin infections in people exposed through recreational use of the water. The viruses and the nucleic acid signature survive for an extended period in the marine environment. One of the primary concerns of public health officials is the relationship between the presence of pathogens and the recreational risk to human health in polluted marine environments. While {{a number of studies have}} attempted to address this issue, the relationship is still poorly understood. A contributing factor to our lack of progress in the field has been the lack of sensitive methods to detect the broad range of both bacterial and viral pathogens.
