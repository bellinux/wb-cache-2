5|$|Jean Beliveau's number 4 was {{retired in}} 1971 {{after he left}} the game as the all-time leading scorer in Stanley Cup playoff history. Beliveau was offered, but declined, the {{position}} of Governor General of Canada in 1994; he is the only hockey player known to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> serve in this capacity. Guy Lafleur's number 10 followed in February 1985 after his first retirement. Lafleur was a six-time All-Star with the Canadiens, and won three scoring titles and two most valuable player awards. Also in 1985, Doug Harvey's number 2 was raised to the rafters. The defenceman won six Norris Trophies as the NHL's top defenceman in seven years between 1955 and 1961. Jacques Plante's number 1 was retired on October 17, 1995. Plante revolutionized the way goaltenders played the game, and he leads the Canadiens with 314career wins.|$|E
5|$|Walton's last {{work of the}} 1940s was {{his music}} for Olivier's film of Hamlet (1948). After that, he focused his attentions on his opera Troilus and Cressida. On {{the advice of the}} BBC, he invited Christopher Hassall to write the libretto. This did not help Walton's {{relations}} with the Sitwells, each of whom thought he or she should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> be his librettist. Work continued slowly over the next few years, with many breaks while Walton turned to other things. In 1950 he and Heifetz recorded the Violin Concerto for EMI. In 1951 Walton was knighted. In the same year, he prepared an authorised version of Façade, which had undergone many revisions since its premiere. In 1953, following the accession of Elizabeth II he was again called on to write a coronation march, Orb and Sceptre; he was also commissioned to write a choral setting of the Te Deum for the occasion.|$|E

25|$|Since the 1990s, Parliamentary {{elections}} have generally not {{resulted in a}} single party or group of parties having a distinct majority, until the 2014 Lok Sabha elections when BJP received a clear majority. In such cases, Presidents have used their discretion and directed Prime Ministerial aspirants to establish their credentials before being invited to form the government. Typically, the aspirants <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> produce letters from various party leaders, with the signatures of all the MPs who are pledging support to their candidature. This is {{in addition to the}} requirement that a Prime Minister prove he has the support of the Lok Sabha (by a vote {{on the floor of the}} House) within weeks of being sworn into office.|$|E
25|$|In {{a comment}} the {{following}} year on the same thread, Shelby questioned how {{it was that the}} dive shop employees failed to notice his son's truck in the parking lot throughout the day after he was last seen even though it was within their view the whole time. He is further critical of how the Holmes County sheriff's office handled the investigation, saying they should have treated it as a crime scene from the beginning. In particular, he claims, the lie detector test that Taran passed was inadequate, as it had consisted of only three questions (he says he later learned that a properly administered examination with the device should take over an hour), and that Kelly and Cronin should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> take the test as well.|$|E
25|$|The Attorney General is a non-cabinet {{minister}} {{who leads the}} Attorney General's Office. The rule that no Attorney General may be a cabinet minister is a political convention rather than a law, and {{for a short time}} the Attorney General did sit in cabinet, starting with Lord Birkenhead in 1915 and ending with Douglas Hogg in 1928. There is nothing that prohibits Attorneys-General from attending meetings of the cabinet, and on occasion they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> attend meetings to advise the government on the best course of action legally. Despite this it is considered preferable to exclude Attorneys General from cabinet meetings so as to draw a distinct line between them and the political decisions on which they are giving legal advice. As a government minister, the Attorney General is directly answerable to Parliament.|$|E

As the outgoing leader of the Liberal Party, Dion would have become prime minister, likely serving until the Liberal leadership convention in May 2009. Further, Liberal party elders Frank McKenna, Paul Martin, John Manley, and former NDP premier Roy Romanow, were reported to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> form an economic advisory body to the coalition if needed, though both McKenna and Manley declined to take part.|$|E

500|$|Of Offenbach's two serious operas, Die Rheinnixen, a failure, was not revived {{until the}} 21st century. His second attempt, The Tales of Hoffmann, was {{originally}} {{intended as a}} grand opera. When the work was accepted by Léon Carvalho for production at the Opéra-Comique, Offenbach agreed {{to make it an}} opéra comique with spoken dialogue. It was incomplete when he died; Faris speculates that, but for Georges Bizet's premature death, Bizet rather than Guiraud would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> complete the piece and would have done so more satisfactorily. The critic Tim Ashley writes, [...] "Stylistically, the opera reveals a remarkable amalgam of French and German influences … Weberian chorales preface Hoffmann's narrative. Olympia delivers a big coloratura aria straight out of French grand opera, while Antonia sings herself to death to music reminiscent of Schubert." ...|$|E

When I tried to write an Olympic lyric, though, {{it was full of}} sports socks and ribbons. I ended up pissing myself laughing". Then, she called Sjón, an Icelandic poet who had previously collaborated with her on songs such as [...] "Bachelorette" [...] from her fourth studio album Homogenic (1997). When she said to him that they would need something [...] "suitably epic" [...] for the Olympics, the poet even took a short course about Greek mythology at Reykjavík University. [...] "Oceania" [...] was the last song recorded for Medúlla. Björk said about the song: [...] "I am incredibly honoured to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> write a song and sing it at the Olympics. The song is written {{from the point of view}} of the ocean that surrounds all the land and watches over the humans to see how they are doing after millions of years of evolution.

500|$|The Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) {{abandoned}} the Rockaway Beach Branch in 1962, {{and ever since}} it has been sought after for reactivation for train service. The line hasn't been reactivated due to local opposition, specifically the homeowners who live along the right-of-way. One group wants the line's reactivation for transit service. A second group would use the right-of-way as a linear park, known as the Queensway, a proposal inspired {{by the success of}} the High Line in Manhattan. The final group involving homeowners would have nothing done, keeping the line as is. Most plans call for the line to be used for subway service, with the line being connected to the south with the IND Rockaway Line. Talks of reactivating the line were publicly endorsed in February 2012 by Assemblymen Phillip Goldfeder and Michael G. Miller. Goldfeder commented [...] "The commute for people here is only going to go from bad to worse. You can’t talk about a convention center without talking about transportation." [...] Goldfeder and Miller said they are not opposed to turning sections of the line into a park, but said {{people who live in the}} Rockaways, Ozone Park and other areas have no quick or easy way to get into Manhattan. The Genting Group, which operates Resorts World casino and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>asked</b> <b>to</b> construct the convention center, are evaluating several plans to increase transportation access. Genting is committed to paying for part of the transportation improvements. Advocates of the Queensway, a proposed public park along the branch's route, are against resumption of rail service, stating that current bus service fills current transportation needs in the area. Congressmen Hakeem Jeffries and Gregory Meeks added their support for the project in March 2013. Both representatives will push to allocate federal transportation subsidies to study a plan for restored passenger service.|$|E
