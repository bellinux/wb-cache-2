40|$|The recent deconstruction {{approach}} for demolition projects promotes reusing and recycling materials. However, the demolition project is interrupted and slowed down while the project team {{wait for the}} waste exchange process. Wasted materials generated from the demolition project have to be stored on demolition site or extra depository. Cost and time might be lost for the <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>wasted</b> materials and products. Just-in-Time (JIT) is a matured method widely used in manufacture industry as well as construction industry. It is utilised to reduce the <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> both raw materials and final products. It {{is also used to}} shorten production cycle and improve the quality of the products. The JIT philosophy can be applied into demolition project so that the <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>wasted</b> materials can be eliminated and the project time can be shortened. To implement JIT demolition, the waste exchange process can be performed before the wasted materials are generated from the project. Material owners and demanders can virtually plan for waste handling before the demolition project is physically implemented. As a result, waste materials can be sent to demanders through transportation right after they are produced from the project. Applying JIT philosophy in demolition projects can effectively reduce the <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>wasted</b> materials and the amount <b>of</b> demolition <b>waste</b> to be sent to landfills. Therefore the cost and time of the project are reduced, and the quality of final delivered materials is improved. <br /...|$|R

In addition, it is useful to gain an economic understanding on the importance of the underlying industry structure, irrespective of the kind <b>of</b> <b>wastes</b> to be removed. This may be especially true in complex scenarios such as hospital organizations: to conceive an external supplier {{as an integral part of}} a value stream map may be especially challenging to understand for clinicians.

40|$|This mid-project {{report is}} a {{required}} deliverable for a BGS project {{commissioned by the}} Northern Ireland Department of the Environment (DoENI) to assist in their implementation of the EU Mine Waste Directive (MWD) with regards to Article 20 − <b>Inventory</b> <b>of</b> closed <b>waste</b> facilities. The objective of this project is to address the requirement of the EU Directive for an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> closed <b>waste</b> facilities, including abandoned facilities, which cause or could potentially cause serious negative environmental impacts or are {{a serious threat to}} human health. The report describes the approach taken and project progress to date. For the purposes of this project the term “closed mine waste facilities” should be considered to include “abandoned mine waste facilities”. The EU Directive requires the application of risk assessment methods in the <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> closed <b>waste</b> facilities that are either known or have the potential of impacting the environment or human health, i. e. there must be a link between the source of a hazard in the waste facility and an identified receptor. Our approach to developing the inventory is based on: Annex III of the MWD, which refers to the “Criteria for determining the classification <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> facilities”, and the EC 2011 “Guidance document for a risk-based pre-selection protocol for the <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> closed <b>waste</b> facilities”. The latter provides guidance to Member States on the methodology for producing a precautionary list <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> facilities that would be candidate sites for the inclusion in the inventory. We also consider the methodology devised by the Environment Agency in England and Wales (EA, 2012) and similar work undertaken by the Geological Survey of Ireland when creating an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> historic mine sites for the Republic of Ireland. A phased approach is being followed, consisting of an initial qualitative study (Phase 1), aimed at data collection and categorisation. This will be followed by a more quantitative data assessment phase (Phase 2), which appraises potential environmental impacts of the closed mine waste facilities. Both phases are desk-based studies and, do not require fieldwork-based activities. The Phase 2 output will identify and rank potential inventory sites and will seek to establish spatial linkages between the mine sites and water and/or sediment geochemical data for stream water and sediment data values that exceed specified chemical quality assessment criteria. Phase 2 will use data held by the GSNI and BGS. The most impacted sites should then be investigated through field visits and further sampling and testing. This assessment does not address physical hazards, which also require consideration under the Directive. The project outputs should be complemented by information sourced from relevant authorities on known concerns about risks to human or animal health, stability, and fire or air pollution...|$|R
40|$|Nearly half of {{the high}} level {{radioactive}} waste stored at Hanford is composed of highly alkaline concentrates referred to as either salt cakes or Double-Shell Slurry (DSS), depending on their compositions and processing histories. The major components of these concentrates are water, sodium hydroxide, and sodium salts of nitrate, nitrite, aluminate, carbonate, phosphate, and sulfate.

40|$|Background: Traditionally, biomass {{has been}} used as energy {{resource}} in areas of proximity to its production areas. However, an emerging practice is for energy producers to actively pursue finding biomass, thus having to consider a multitude of different issues. Method of approach: This paper provides a comprehensive <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> the available biomass and organic substrates for energetic utilization through incineration or anaerobic fermentation in the Hellenic region of Central Macedonia. It proposes a three-step methodology for the development <b>of</b> an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> biomass in order to provide the available data for a feasibility study of an energy production facility setup. This study covers a wide range of organic substrates from agricultural and stock farming activities to secondary organic material such as waste from food processing units. Special attention is given to the availability and the characterization of the substrates in reference to their reverse logistics supply-chain management. Data required for the development of proper logistics for the collection of the substrates are gathered and classified. Results: There is a significant potential for energy production in the Region under consideration, but also a frequently well established competitive market for agriculture by-products, such as straw, as feedstock for stock farming. Conclusions: Certain biomass supply chains already exist on regional scale for transportation of feedstock for stock farming but, in order to include new target materials and different specific needs for temporary storage and eventual pre-treatment, certain new structures have to be developed...|$|R

Therefore, a need emerges to thoroughly examine the containers' contents. This paper describes the work performed at the Forschungszentrum Juelich (KFA) to quality control radioactive waste drums by applying tomogrpahy techniques. In particular, a tomography assay system is built {{which is designed to}} analyze Low-Level-Waste (LLW) contained in 200 liter drums of a maximum surface dose rate of 2 mSv/h. Prior to determining the nuclide <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> a radioactive <b>waste</b> drum, the measurement of the density distribution by a technique called Transmission Computerized Tomography (TCT) is applied. In TCT, the drum's attenuation of a #gamma#-beam radiated by an external source is measured by one or more detectors. The density throughout an observed plane of the drum is then visualized by a density image. Generally, the internal attenuation of the emitted radiation by the sources contained in the drum, cannot be neglected. For this reason, the attenuation coefficients obtained form the transmission measurements, are applied to correct the emission data of the internal sources. Finally, the analysis and visualization of the activity distribution within the drum is carried out by applying the technique of Emission Computerized Tomography (ECT).

Currently, many European countries consider the final disposal of HLW and ILW indeep geological formations as the most preferable option. In Germany the main stream of HLWand ILW include spent fuel assemblies from nuclear power plants (NPPs), the vitrified wasteand compacted metallic <b>waste</b> <b>of</b> the fuel assembly structural parts originate from reprocessingplants. An important task that occurs {{within the framework of}} the Product Quality Control(PQC) <b>of</b> nuclear <b>waste</b> is the assessment of the compliance <b>of</b> any reprocessed <b>waste</b> productinventory with the prescribed limits for each relevant radionuclide (RN). The PQC task is toverify the required quality and safety <b>of</b> nuclear <b>waste</b> prior to transportation to a Germanrepository and to avert the disposal <b>of</b> non-conform <b>waste</b> packages. The verification is usuallybased on comparing the declared radionuclide <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> with the presumed orexpected composition, which is estimated, based on the known history <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> and itsprocessing. The difficulty of such estimations for radioactive components from nuclear fuelassemblies is that reactor design parameters and operating histories can have a significantinfluence on the nuclide <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> any individual fuel assembly. Thus, knowledge of theseparameters is a key issue to determine the realistic concentration ranges, or bandwidths, ofthe radionuclide inventory. As soon as a governmental decision on the construction <b>of</b> a high-level <b>waste</b> repository willbe made, comprehensive radionuclide <b>inventories</b> <b>of</b> the <b>wastes</b> assigned for the deposition willbe required.

50|$|The deep {{borehole}} concept can {{be applied}} to any amount <b>of</b> <b>waste.</b> For countries that do not rely on nuclear power plants, their entire <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> high-level nuclear <b>waste</b> could perhaps be disposed of in a single borehole. Current estimates suggest that spent fuel generated from a single large nuclear power plant operating for multiple decades could be disposed of in fewer than ten boreholes. It is estimated that only 800 boreholes would be sufficient to store the entire existing nuclear <b>waste</b> stockpile <b>of</b> the USA. Borehole disposal programs could be terminated at any time with little loss of investment because each borehole is independent. The modular nature of borehole disposal would lend itself to regional, or on-site, disposal <b>of</b> nuclear <b>waste.</b> Another attraction <b>of</b> the deep borehole option is that holes might be drilled and waste emplaced using modifications of existing oil and gas drilling technologies.|$|R
40|$|When {{assessing}} {{the environmental and}} human health impact of a municipal food waste (FW) management system waste managers typically rely on the principles <b>of</b> the <b>waste</b> hierarchy; using metrics such as the mass or rate <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> that is &# 039;prepared for recycling,&# 039; &# 039;recovered for energy,&# 039; or &# 039;sent to landfill. &# 039; These metrics measure the collection and sorting efficiency <b>of</b> a <b>waste</b> system but are incapable of determining the efficiency of a system to turn waste into a valuable resource. In this study a life cycle approach was employed using a system boundary that includes the entire waste service provision from collection to safe end-use or disposal. A life cycle <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> seven <b>waste</b> management systems was calculated, including the first service wide <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> FW management through kitchen in-sink disposal (food waste disposer). Results describe the mass, energy and water balance of each system along with key emissions profile. It was demonstrated that the energy balance can differ significantly from its&# 039; energy generation, exemplified by mechanical biological treatment, which was the best system for generating energy from waste but only 5 th best for net-energy generation. Furthermore, the energy balance of kitchen in-sink disposal was shown to be reduced because 31 % of volatile solids were lost in pre-treatment. The study also confirmed that higher FW landfill diversion rates were critical for reducing many harmful emissions to air and water. Although, mass-balance analysis showed that the alternative end-use of the FW material may still contain high impact pollutants...|$|R
30|$|In Germany, {{over the}} last 200  years, PCDD/Fs in {{quantities}} of several 100  kg to tonnes PCDD/F-TEQ have been released into the environment, with the largest releases in the 1940 s– 1980 s from the chlorine and organochlorine industry [6, 8, 124, 125]. For one pesticide factory with a detailed PCDD/F <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> disposed <b>waste,</b> the PCDD/F-content in waste deposits to landfills was estimated as 333 – 856  kg TEQ in 53 – 102 tonnes total sum of PCDD/PCDF [6], which {{can be compared to}} the global release of approx. 100  kg TEQ/year from 196 countries today [67]. As early as the nineteenth century, the first chemical factories producing soda (Na 2 CO 3) from sodium chloride via the Leblanc process, along with bleaching powder from waste HCl, had high PCDD/F releases. For a single Leblanc factory operated from 1840 s to 1893, soil assessments indicated a contamination reservoir of 1 – 10  kg TEQ in the soils [126].|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} mercury {{distribution in}} soils and plants of the catchment {{area of the}} Bol'shoe Yarovoe lake with the Altaikhimprom chemical industrial complex localized on its shore. Data on mercury contents show considerable mercury flow into environment, though the industrial complex and its waste do not pose serious threat. Revealed pollution {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the industrial complex including that due to atmospheric transport, as well as elevated content of mercury in hydrochloric and alkaline extracts suggest its intense migration from the waste. Therefore, it is necessary to make an <b>inventory</b> <b>of</b> the industrial-complex <b>waste</b> and perform a detailed study of the lake ecosystem as a model unit...|$|R
40|$|Purpose of this {{document}} is {{to define the}} system requirements necessary to improve computer support for the WHC backlog waste business process through enhancements to the backlog <b>waste</b> function <b>of</b> the SWITS system. This SRS document covers enhancements to the SWITS system to support changes to the existing Backlog Waste screens including new data elements, label changes, and new pop-up screens. The pop-ups will allow the user to flag the processes that a waste container must have performed on it, and will provide history tracking of changes to data. A new screen will also be provided allowing Acceptable Services to perform mass updates to specific data in Backlog Waste table. The SWITS Backlog Waste enhancements in {{this document}} will support the project goals in WHC-SD-WM- 003 and its Revision 1 (Radioactive Solid Waste Tracking System Conceptual Definition) for the control, tracing, and <b>inventory</b> management <b>of</b> <b>waste</b> as the packages are generated and moved through final disposal (cradle-to-grave) ...|$|R
