5|$|A {{detailed}} re-assessment of the taphonomy by palaeontologist Martin Sander of the University of Bonn, Germany, {{found that}} the mud-miring hypothesis first suggested by Fraas is true: animals above a certain body weight sank <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> which was further liquefied by their attempts to free themselves. Sander's scenario, similar to that proposed for the famous Rancho La Brea Tar Pits, {{is the only one}} explaining all taphonomic data. The degree of completeness of the carcasses was not influenced by transport, which is obvious from the lack of indications for transport before burial, but rather by how much the dead animals were scavenged. Juveniles of Plateosaurus and other taxa of herbivores were too light to sink <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> or managed to extract themselves, and were thus not preserved. Similarly, scavenging theropods were not trapped due to their lower body weights, combined with proportionally larger feet. There is no indication of herding, or of catastrophic burial of such a herd, or catastrophic accumulation of animals that previously died isolated elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|A {{temple was}} {{constructed}} in AD60–70, and a bathing complex was built up over the next 300years. Engineers drove oak piles <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> to provide a stable foundation, and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. In the 2nd century, the spring was enclosed within a wooden barrel-vaulted structure that housed the caldarium (hot bath), tepidarium (warm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath).|$|E
5|$|Three dams {{were built}} {{from the island}} to the mainland. The center dam divided the dock area in half, another was further west and a third dam {{extended}} east across {{what would be the}} entrance. The two outer dams completely closed off the site from the sea. The center dam was built without much difficulty by simply tipping material to form an embankment, although some of the earth sank <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> so more had to be added.|$|E

5000|$|The park's {{narrow slot}} canyons cut deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>muds</b> that {{millions}} of years ago were {{at the bottom of a}} lake. Explorers can crawl through tunnels to discover hidden chambers in the network of canyons which offer some coolness in the summer heat. The park has a campground with 22 non-reservable sites with electric service. ADA-accessible sites are located next to the group use area. Water is available at the RV dump station and in the campground. Bathrooms with hot showers are also available.|$|R

5|$|A {{strategy}} {{for dealing with}} seasonal plenty is to eat {{as much as possible}} and store the surplus nutrients as fat. Marmots do this, and may be 50% heavier in the autumn than in the spring. They rely on their fat reserves during their long winter hibernation. Beavers feed on the leaves, buds, and inner bark of growing trees, as well as aquatic plants. They store food for winter use by felling small trees and leafy branches in the autumn and immersing them in their pond, sticking the ends <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> to anchor them. Here, they can access their food supply underwater even when their pond is frozen over.|$|E
5|$|When Mulder and Scully search Karin's house, {{they come}} upon the corpsebelonging to Karin's fatherin the root cellar. They then find Lisa, frightened but unharmed, in the kitchen. Karin drives to Bobby's house and chases {{him into the}} orchard. Suddenly, Bobby is dragged {{downward}} <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b> While attempting to rescue the teenager, Mulder simultaneously encourages Karin {{to break the cycle}} and to fight the voice inside her head. A tendon-like root snakes out of the mud and begins to drag Mulder downward. Ramirez appears, his axe in hand, and decapitates Karin, killing her. Mulder and Bobby are released by the unseen force.|$|E
5|$|Both {{ships were}} caught in the harbour during the Battle of Weihaiwei in early 1895, with Zhenyuan only {{partially}} seaworthy. They were unable to prevent the capture of the port's fortifications by the Japanese, and underwent nightly attacks by torpedo boats. Dingyuen was hit by a torpedo and began to sink. She was quickly beached, where she settled <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> and continued {{to be used as a}} defensive fort. Admiral Ruchang's flag was subsequently moved across to Zhenyuan. Following Ruchang's suicide, the surrender of the port and the fleet was arranged. Dingyuen was blown up by the Japanese forces, as they were unable to salvage her, although there is a suggestion following an eye witness account that she may have been mined by the Chinese.|$|E
60|$|Saying this, Babalatchi stepped {{carelessly}} forward, {{putting his}} foot as if accidentally {{on the hand}} of the corpse and pressing it <b>into</b> <b>the</b> soft <b>mud.</b> He swung his staff menacingly towards the crowd, which fell back a little.|$|R
60|$|The {{sun came}} out warm and {{beautiful}} and all about me on every farm the teamsters were getting <b>into</b> <b>the</b> fields. <b>The</b> <b>mud</b> began to dry up and with the growing cheer of the morning my heart expanded {{and the experience of}} the night before became as unreal as a dream and yet it had happened, and it had taught me a needed lesson.

50|$|Work {{began in}} 1858, the Compagnie des chemins de fer de l'Est taking {{responsibility}} for the foundations. In order to sink <b>the</b> piles <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Rhine <b>mud</b> {{it was necessary to}} construct protective caissons extending 18 m below the river level.|$|R
5|$|Commander Alfred Godsal led {{the assault}} in HMS Brilliant {{and it was}} he who {{stumbled}} into the most effective German counter-measure first. As Brilliant staggered through the murk, the lookout spotted the buoy ahead and Godsal headed directly for it, coming under even heavier fire as he did so. Passing the navigation marker at speed, the cruiser was suddenly brought to a halt with a juddering lurch, throwing men to the decks and sticking fast in deep mud well outside the harbour mouth. Before warnings could be relayed to the Sirius following up close behind, she too passed the buoy and her captain Lieutenant-Commander Henry Hardy was shocked to see Brilliant dead ahead. With no time to manoeuvree, Sirius ploughed into the port quarter of Brilliant, the blockships settling <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> in a tangle of wreckage.|$|E
5|$|In April 1943 Graf Zeppelin {{was again}} towed eastward, first to Gotenhafen, {{then to the}} {{roadstead}} at Swinemünde and finally berthed at a back-water wharf in the Parnitz River, two miles (3km) from Stettin, {{where she had been}} briefly docked in 1941. There she languished {{for the next two years}} with only a 40-man custodial crew in attendance. When Red Army forces neared the city in April 1945, the ship's Kingston valves were opened, flooding her lower spaces and settling her firmly <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> in shallow water. A ten-man engineering squad then rigged the vessel's interior with demolition and depth charges in order to hole the hull and destroy vital machinery. At 6pm on 25 April 1945, just as the Soviets entered Stettin, commander Wolfgang Kähler radioed the squad to detonate the explosives. Smoke billowing from the carrier's funnel confirmed the charges had gone off, rendering the ship useless to her new owners for many months to come.|$|E
5|$|In the North, {{the armies}} of the eponymous bastards, Jon Snow (Kit Harington) and Ramsay Bolton (Iwan Rheon), face off in a battle for control of Winterfell. The Bolton army defeats most of Jon's force, mostly {{composed}} of Wildlings. Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner) arrives with Petyr Baelish (Aidan Gillen) and the Knights of the Vale who defeat the remaining Bolton army. Ramsay retreats to Winterfell, where Jon beats him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud,</b> locks him in the kennels and Sansa feeds him to his hounds. In Meereen, Daenerys Targaryen (Emilia Clarke) refuses to surrender to the Masters, mounts Drogon and begins burning the Masters' fleet; this forces them to surrender. Yara (Gemma Whelan) and Theon Greyjoy (Alfie Allen) arrive in Meereen and offer their ships to Daenerys, swearing to help her take the Seven Kingdoms.|$|E
5000|$|The Diver is {{constructed}} from (approx.) 300m of galvanised steel banding and 3000 {{nuts and bolts}} and weighs 3 tons. It is secured 26 ft <b>into</b> <b>the</b> Thames <b>mud</b> and was installed at 3:30 am {{in order to avoid}} river traffic.|$|R

5|$|In {{the first}} {{published}} {{discussion of the}} Trossingen Plateosaurus finds, Fraas suggested that only miring in mud allowed {{the preservation of the}} single complete skeleton then known. Similarly, Jaekel interpreted the Halberstadt finds as animals that waded too deep into swamps, became mired and drowned. He interpreted partial remains as having been transported into the deposit by water, and strongly refuted a catastrophic accumulation. In contrast, von Huene interpreted the sediment as aeolian deposits, with the weakest animals, mostly subadults, succumbing to the harsh conditions in the desert and sinking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> of ephemeral water holes. He argued that the completeness of many finds indicated that transport did not happen, and saw partial individuals and isolated bones as results of weathering and trampling. Seemann developed a different scenario, in which Plateosaurus herds congregated on large water holes, and some herd members got pushed in. Light animals managed to get free, while heavy individuals got stuck and died.|$|E
5|$|Some {{species are}} benthic (living on the seabed) and others pelagic (living in mid-water), {{but most are}} found close to, {{crawling}} on or burrowing <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> or sand. Most marine species are benthic by day but leave the seabed at night to become planktonic. Locomotion is mostly by swimming, the pleopods being used for this purpose. Some mysids live among algae and seagrasses, some are solitary while many form dense swarms. Mysids form {{an important part of}} the diet of such fish as shad and flounder. In general, they are free-living, but a few species, mostly in the subfamily Heteromysinae, are commensal and are associated with sea anemones and hermit crabs. Several taxa have also been described from different freshwater habitats and caves. Mysis relicta and its close relatives inhabit cold, deep lakes and have a diurnal cycle of vertical migrations.|$|E
5|$|The name Sulis {{continued}} to be used after the Roman invasion, leading to the town's Roman name of Aquae Sulis ("the waters of Sulis"). The temple was constructed in 60–70 AD and the bathing complex was gradually built up over the next 300 years. During the Roman occupation of Britain, and possibly on the instructions of Emperor Claudius, engineers drove oak piles to provide a stable foundation <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. In the 2nd century it was enclosed within a wooden barrel-vaulted building, and included the caldarium (hot bath), tepidarium (lukewarm bath), and frigidarium (cold bath). After the Roman withdrawal from Britain {{in the first decade}} of the 5th century, these fell into disrepair and were eventually lost due to silting up, and flooding. The Anglo-Saxon Chronicle suggests the original Roman baths were destroyed in the 6th century.|$|E
5000|$|A pipe {{is moved}} {{up and down}} in a hole filled with water (<b>mud).</b> Every time <b>the</b> pipe hits the bottom, some soil {{material}} is loosened and suspended <b>into</b> <b>the</b> drilling <b>mud,</b> which is continuously pumped out of the borehole by a valve, taking advantage of the same reciprocating movement.|$|R
50|$|Indeed, as {{burrowing}} became established, {{it allowed}} {{an explosion of}} its own, for as burrowers disturbed the sea floor, they aerated it, mixing oxygen <b>into</b> <b>the</b> toxic <b>muds.</b> This made <b>the</b> bottom sediments more hospitable, and allowed {{a wider range of}} organisms to inhabit them - creating new niches and the scope for higher diversity.|$|R
60|$|The {{black man}} began {{swimming}} toward the right bank, but there he saw Uncle Nep {{and half the}} royal tribe waiting to stamp him <b>into</b> <b>the</b> soft <b>mud.</b> So he turned toward the left bank, and there stood the queen mother and Uncle Nikki, red-eyed and angry, waiting to tear him with their tusks.|$|R
5|$|The roots are, generally, an {{underground}} {{part of the}} tree, but some tree species have evolved roots that are aerial. The common purposes for aerial roots may be of two kinds, {{to contribute to the}} mechanical stability of the tree, and to obtain oxygen from air. An instance of mechanical stability enhancement is the red mangrove that develops prop roots that loop out of the trunk and branches and descend vertically <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b> A similar structure is developed by the Indian banyan. Many large trees have buttress roots which flare out from {{the lower part of the}} trunk. These brace the tree rather like angle brackets and provide stability, reducing sway in high winds. They are particularly prevalent in tropical rainforests where the soil is poor and the roots are close to the surface.|$|E
5|$|There {{were three}} {{trenches}} {{in a typical}} front line sector; the fire trench, the support trench and the reserve trench, all joined by communication trenches. The trenches varied in depth, but they were usually {{about four or five}} feet deep, or in areas with a high water table a wall of sandbags would be built to allow the defenders to stand upright, fire trenches were provided with a fire step, so the occupants could return fire during an attack (see diagram). Ideally, the bottom of the trench was lined with duckboards to prevent men from sinking <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> and dugouts were cut into the walls, these gave shelter from the elements and shrapnel, although in the British Army dugouts were usually reserved for the officers and senior NCOs. The men were then expected to sleep wherever they could and in wet weather they lived under groundsheets or in tents {{at the bottom of the}} trench on the duckboards.|$|E
5|$|Newly hatched New Guinea {{crocodiles}} feed on aquatic insects, spiders, tadpoles, freshwater snails, frogs, {{fish and}} small mammals. As they grow, {{so does the}} size of their prey and their consumption of fish rises, but they still will eat anything of a worthwhile size that they can find. An adult's diet is largely fish, caught by sweeping the snout sideways and snapping at the prey, but also includes shrimps, crabs, frogs, snakes, birds and medium-sized mammals. A crocodile catches its prey by stealth with a flick of its head, impaling it with its sharp teeth and gripping and crushing it. The jaws cannot move sideways to chew the food; instead, the crocodile's head is tossed to move the prey {{to the back of the}} mouth before the prey is swallowed whole. This crocodile is surprisingly agile and can lunge its body upward into the air to catch bats, flying birds, and leaping fish. It can also probe <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> at the bottom of a river or swamp with its snout to search for crabs and molluscs.|$|E
60|$|The boy who neglects {{his prayers}} to go boating on a Sunday {{ought not to}} be drowned.

5|$|On August 15, the Egyptians {{launched}} an offensive from their major north-western base in Haradh. They had 1,000 troops and about 2,000 republicans. The plan, as interpreted by British intelligence, {{seemed to have}} been to cut the thirty-mile track southward through the mountains from the Saudi border at Khoubah to al-Badr's headquarters in the Qara mountains near Washa, and then to split into two task forces, one moving east through Washa to the headquarters and the other north-eastwards along the track to the Saudi border below the Razih mountains. The Egyptians began their move on Saturday morning, moving along the Haradh and Tashar ravines. On Saturday and Sunday afternoons they were caught in heavy rain and their vehicles, including twenty tanks and about forty armored cars sank axle deep <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud.</b> The defenders left them alone until Monday at dawn. Al-Badr left his headquarters at three that morning with 1,000 men to direct a counterattack in the Tashar ravine, while Abdullah Hussein attacked in the Haradh ravine.|$|E
5|$|The Baths {{were built}} around hot springs, {{the only ones}} {{naturally}} occurring in the United Kingdom. Archaeological {{evidence suggests that the}} main spring in its natural state was treated as a shrine by the Celts. During the early Roman occupation of Britain, in the 60s or 70s AD, engineers drove oak piles <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> to provide a stable foundation and surrounded the spring with an irregular stone chamber lined with lead. These still survive. At this early stage the spring was an open pool {{in the corner of the}} temple precinct. It fed a bathing complex on its south side within a barrel-vaulted building. The complex was gradually built up over the next 300years. All the stonework above the level of the baths is from more recent periods including the 12th century, when John of Tours built a curative bath over the King's Spring reservoir, and the 16th century, when the city corporation built a new bath (Queen's Bath) to the south of the spring. The spring is now housed in 18th-century buildings designed by architects John Wood, the Elder and John Wood, the Younger; visitor access is via an 1897 concert hall by J M Brydon, which is an eastward continuation of the Grand Pump Room with a glass-domed centre and single-storey radiused corner.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, {{as part of}} {{the ongoing}} storyline with Bryan, McMahon {{threatened}} to fire his wife Brie Bella if Bryan did not relinquish the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which forced Brie to quit before slapping McMahon in the face. On the June 16 episode of Raw, Roman Reigns spiked the coffee Vickie Guerrero gave to McMahon, causing Stephanie to throw up on Vickie and leave with Triple H to the hospital. Vickie later gave Reigns a chance in the battle royal, which he would win. On the June 23 episode of Raw, Vickie lost in a pudding match against McMahon with her job on the line, after interference by Alicia Fox, Layla and Rosa Mendes. Vickie ultimately lost the match and was fired, however she got her retribution over McMahon by throwing her <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>mud</b> pool. After Brie quit, McMahon put Brie's sister Nikki in several handicap matches as punishment. Brie returned to television on the July 21 episode of Raw, appearing in the crowd leading to confrontation between the two. McMahon was (kayfabe) arrested and charged with assault and battery, because she slapped Brie, who was not a (kayfabe) WWE employee The following week, McMahon granted Brie her job back and a match at SummerSlam against her in order to get Brie to drop the lawsuit. On the August 4 episode of Raw, after their contract signing, Stephanie pedigreed both twins. At SummerSlam, Nikki turned on Brie, allowing Stephanie to hit a pedigree on Brie having Stephanie win her first pay per view match in over 10 years.|$|E
