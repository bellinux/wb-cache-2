40|$|Wound and its <b>healing</b> {{process are}} thought to be {{complicated}} process in the world. In fact, a wound <b>heals</b> in an orderly effective and in a systematic manner. The process of wound <b>healing</b> can be divided into four distinct phases but seen to be overlapping with each other.

40|$|Self <b>healing</b> {{of asphalt}} mixes {{is known for}} more than four decades. However, it is a complex {{phenomenon}} which depends on the duration of the rest period, temperature, crack size, etc. In order to quantify the self <b>healing</b> behaviour of asphalt mixes, a test setup was proposed in this research using an asphalt beam on an elastic foundation. Within this setup, a notched asphalt beam was glued on a low modulus rubber foundation, and a symmetric monotonic load was applied with loading–unloading–healing–reloading cycles. The rubber foundation was used to avoid permanent deformation and to ensure a controllable <b>healing</b> process. Experimental results indicate that the beam on elastic foundation (BOEF) setup is capable for self <b>healing</b> investigations of asphalt mixes. The <b>healing</b> process was quantified by the recovery of the strength and the recovery of the crack opening displacement. The time, temperature and crack size dependency of the self <b>healing</b> behaviour were observed over the <b>healing</b> periods. Moreover, a self <b>healing</b> model was proposed to decompose the self <b>healing</b> phenomenon observed in the BOEF <b>healing</b> tests. It is shown that {{at the beginning of the}} <b>healing</b> period the delayed visco-elastic <b>healing</b> is the main reason of the recovery of the crack opening displacement and the viscous <b>healing</b> is important for <b>healing</b> after longer time/higher temperature.
