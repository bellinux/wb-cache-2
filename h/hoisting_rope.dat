5000|$|In mines where {{grades were}} not uniform {{or where the}} grades were not steep enough for gravity to pull a train into the mine, the main <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope</b> could be {{augmented}} with a tail rope connected to {{the opposite end of}} the train of mine cars. The tail-rope system had its origins on cable-hauled surface inclines prior to the 1830s. [...] This was the dominant system in the 1880s [...] Frequently, one engine was used to work both ropes, with the tail rope reaching into the mine, around a pulley at the far end, and then out again.|$|E

50|$|The {{observation}} {{house is}} offset {{south of the}} tower's centreline and hexagonal in plan (the stairs are similarly offset). Its walls and five-faceted roof are timber-framed. Externally it is clad with chamferboards {{on the walls and}} metal sheeting on the roof. Internally it is lined with tongue-and-groove vertical boards. A door leads out to the circular balcony that surrounds it. The balustrade is wrought iron while the balcony floor is lined with flat copper sheets with timber duckboarding over. It is supported on the outside by closely spaced carved timber brackets. A round hardwood mast projects out of the roof of the cabin. It has a 160 square base, is lap-spliced inside the cabin to a 160 square post that carries down to the third floor. A riveted copper time-ball with central hole sits atop the cabin, with its <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope</b> running through top of the mast.|$|E
5000|$|Friction (or Koepe) hoists are {{the most}} common type of hoist used in Europe, Asia and Australia. [...] The {{friction}} hoist was invented in 1877 by Frederick Koepe. [...] Friction hoists are mounted on the ground above the mine shaft, or at the top of the headframe. Friction hoists utilize tail ropes and counterweights and do not have the haulage rope fixed to the wheel, but instead passed around it. The tailropes and weights offset the need for the motor to overcome the weight of the conveyance and <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope,</b> thereby reducing the required horsepower of the hoisting motor by up to 30%, with the overall power consumption remaining the same. Friction hoists, unlike drum hoists, can and normally do use multiple ropes giving them a larger payload capacity, however since they require a larger safety factor, they are impractical for very deep shafts.|$|E
30|$|The {{longitudinal}} vibrations of ropes in mine hoist {{have been}} widely studied by many researchers. The single-rope mine drum is the catenary–vertical rope system and the coupled lateral–longitudinal dynamic response of the cables was studied by Kaczmarczyk and Ostachowicz (2003 a, 2003 b). Qin (2007) analyzed the longitudinal vibration of hoisting ropes by using the Lagrange principle. Li (2010) established Horizontal and vertical vibration models of the hoisting container under the steel guide and the vibration characteristic of hoisting container under different faults of steel guide was studied. To master the impact dynamical behaviors of the <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope</b> during the skip loading, the mechanical model of the coupled longitudinal-torsional vibration for <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope</b> were built by Cao (2010).|$|E

40|$|Lifting {{operation}} on a FPSO (Floating Production, Storage and Offloading vessel) {{is much more}} demanding for the crane and the crane driver than similar operations on a fixed offshore platform. Due to {{the motion of the}} FPSO in heavy sea and strong wind, the crane is subjected to additional dynamic forces as well as swinging loads. The present paper deals with numerical simulation of the dynamic behaviour of the Norne offshore crane during lifting operation. The simulations are performed by FEDEM – a general nonlinear dynamic analysis program for flexible multibody systems. The pedestal, “king ” and boom are flexible links modelled by shell finite elements and connected together by different joints. The <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope</b> and the hydraulic cylinders are modelled by linear and nonlinear spring and damper elements. A control system is implemented in the model making it possible to control the movement of the boom and the winch to compensate for the relative motion between the ship and the supply vessel and keep the load in rest relative to the vessel. Examples are shown of calculated natural frequencies and mode shapes as function of <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope</b> length and boom angle. Furthermore, maximum dynamic stresses in different sections/details are presented as function of how the crane is operated. Besides giving necessary stress data for design verification against overload and fatigue, the presented model can be used to optimise the operation procedure, determine the maximum allowable load for various sea states and to calculate necessary power to control the motion of the load...|$|E
40|$|The {{level of}} wire rope {{technology}} used in mine hoisting applications {{has a significant}} effect on the overall efficiency of the hoisting system. This paper discusses the effect that a reduction in rope mass per unit length and an increase in rope breaking strength can have on rock skip capacity and hence mine shaft output. A 20 per cent reduction in rope mass per metre for a typical 48 mm <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope,</b> while maintaining the breaking strength, increases the skip’s capacity by circa 30 per cent at a suspended rope length of 3000 m. Such gains in shaft output, without any significant changes to the shaft or winder design, can have major implications for the feasibility of future deep mine projects. The technical challenge for rope manufacturers is how to get rid of 20 to 30 per cent of the rope mass while keeping the breaking strength and modulus of elasticity of the whole rope constant. CASAR are currently developing steel wire rope constructions where the steel IWRC has been replaced with high strength...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{hoisting}} load on transverse vibrations of hoisting catenaries during lifting in coal mines {{was investigated in}} this study. Firstly, dynamic analyses of the vertical <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope</b> were performed. The results show that transverse vibration plays the dominating role in the coupled dynamics of the vertical rope subjected to external excitation induced by axial fluctuations of head sheave, and the rope tension can be approximated by the quasistatic tension. Secondly, employing dynamic simulations, the effect of hoisting load on the transverse vibrations of hoisting catenaries was discussed. The results show that, under the second-order excitation frequency, a discrepant large transverse amplitude will be excited when the hoisting load ranges from 0 to 5000 [*]kg, leading to collision between the two adjacent catenaries and accelerating the rupture of rope. To solve this problem, according to simulation curves, the self-weight of conveyance (preload) can be optimized from 39500 [*]kg to 49500 [*]kg. Eventually, on-site measurements were performed on the studied machine, validating {{the accuracy of the}} effect of hoisting load on transverse vibrations of hoisting catenaries. This investigation will greatly support facility maintenance, machine design, and even engineering optimization for floor type multirope friction mine hoists...|$|E

50|$|In {{a typical}} cycle of excavation, the bucket is {{positioned}} above {{the material to}} be excavated. The bucket is then lowered and the dragrope is then drawn so that the bucket is dragged along {{the surface of the}} material. The bucket is then lifted by using the <b>hoist</b> <b>rope.</b> A swing operation is then performed to move the bucket to the place where the material is to be dumped. The dragrope is then released causing the bucket to tilt and empty. This is called a dump operation.|$|R
40|$|Gantry Cranes {{are common}} {{industrial}} structures {{that are used}} in building construction, factories, and harbors. These cranes are usually operated manually. With the size of these cranes becoming larger and the motion expected to be faster, the process of controlling them became difficult without using automatic control methods. In general, the movement of cranes has no prescribed path. Cranes have to be run under different operating conditions, which makes closed-loop control preferable. The aim of this project is to develop a controller to reduce the sway angle of the rope for a two dimensional gantry crane system. The 2 D-gantry crane system consists of a cart, rope, payload, actuator as well as controller. In this project, the control technique to be implemented to control the sway angle of the rope is Delayed Feedback Signal (DFS). In DFS, the control signal is calculated based on delayed position feedback. The performance on system in 2 D-gantry crane focused on the sway angle of the <b>hoisting</b> <b>rope</b> and its corresponding Power Spectral Density (PSD) on the sway angle response. Finally, the comparative assessment {{of the effects of the}} system using DFS controller is tested by using different values of the parameters such as mass of the load, length of the rode and the initial point of release load...|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} of the elevator was also essential {{to the emergence of}} the early skyscrapers, as office buildings taller than around six stories would have been impractical without them. Powered elevators were first installed in England during the 1830s and spread to U.S. factories and hotels by the 1840s. Elevators using <b>hoist</b> <b>ropes,</b> however, could only function effectively in low-rise buildings, and this limitation encouraged the introduction of the hydraulic elevator in 1870, even though early models contained dangerous design flaws. By 1876 these problems had been resolved, providing a solution for servicing the early skyscrapers.|$|R

50|$|A crane {{is a type}} of machine, {{generally}} {{equipped with}} a <b>hoist</b> <b>rope,</b> wire ropes or chains, and sheaves, that can be used both to lift and lower materials and to move them horizontally. It is mainly used for lifting heavy things and transporting them to other places. The device uses one or more simple machines to create mechanical advantage and thus move loads beyond the normal capability of a human. Cranes are commonly employed in the transport industry for the loading and unloading of freight, in the construction industry for the movement of materials, and in the manufacturing industry for the assembling of heavy equipment.|$|R
50|$|UDD {{stands for}} Universal-Dig-Dump. It {{represents}} the first fundamental change to draglines {{for almost a}} century, since {{the invention of the}} 'miracle hitch'. Instead of using two <b>ropes</b> (the <b>hoist</b> <b>rope</b> and the drag rope) to manipulate the bucket, a UDD machine uses three <b>ropes,</b> two <b>hoist</b> and one drag. This allows the dragline operator to have much greater selectivity in when to pick up the bucket, and in how the bucket may be dumped. UDD machines generally have higher productivity than a standard dragline, but often have greater mechanical issues. Within the mining industry, there is still much debate as to whether UDD improvements justify their costs.|$|R
5000|$|Drum hoists are {{the most}} common type of hoist used in North America, South Africa and South America. When using a drum hoist the {{hoisting}} cable is wound around the drum when the conveyance is lifted. Single-drum hoists can be used in smaller applications, however double-drum hoists easily allow the hoisting of two conveyances in balance (i.e. one skip being lifted while a second skip is being lowered). [...] Drum hoists are mounted on concrete slabs within a hoistroom, the <b>hoisting</b> <b>ropes</b> run from the drum, up to the top of the headframe, over a sheave wheel and down where they connect to the conveyance (cage or skip).|$|R

Although lubricants are added to ropes during the manufacturing process, these lubricants can deteriorate during use, and it is often necessary to add more lubricant to both the interior and exterior of the rope while it is in service. The U. S. Bureau of Mines evaluated the effectiveness of synthetic lubricants, using electromagnetic nondestructive testing (NDT) to measure deterioration in ropes {{while they were in}} service. For nonpressurized lubricant applications, synthetic lubricants appear superior to petroleum-based lubricants in their ability to penetrate to the interior of a rope.

A proper understanding of these processes is important in determining how different parameters of hoist design and operation interact to determine rope life. This knowledge is also important in informing decisions relating to rope discard based upon observed condition, as well is identifying the critical features that must be quantified reliably during inspection...|$|R
