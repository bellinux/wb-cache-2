5|$|There {{were only}} two minor accidents: a car that {{collided}} with the locomotive whilst driving through the hospital grounds, and a wagon whose brakes failed whilst stabled at Farm Siding, which rolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to Hellingly station.|$|E
5|$|For {{the general}} {{case of a}} line {{terminated}} in some arbitrary impedance it is usual to describe the signal as a wave traveling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> and analyse it in the frequency domain. The impedance is consequently represented as a frequency dependant complex function.|$|E

5|$|The French van, pounded by British {{fire from}} both sides, {{had begun to}} surrender, and the victorious British ships {{continued}} to move <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> bringing Brueys's 118-gun flagship Orient under constant heavy fire. Orient caught fire under this bombardment, and later exploded. Nelson briefly came on deck to direct the battle, but returned to the surgeon after watching the destruction of Orient.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} {{component}} forms {{used to construct}} distributed element filters, but all have the common property of causing a discontinuity on the transmission line. These discontinuities present a reactive impedance to a wavefront travelling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> and these reactances can be chosen by design to serve as approximations for lumped inductors, capacitors or resonators, {{as required by the}} filter.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a mauve jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top 15 in a stage. The stage win awarded 25 points, second place awarded 20 points, third 16, fourth 14, fifth 12, sixth 10, and one point less per place <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> to a single point for 15th. In addition, some points could be won in intermediate sprints.|$|E

5|$|Additionally, {{there was}} a points classification, which awarded a red jersey. In the points classification, cyclists got points for {{finishing}} in the top ten in a stage. The stage win awarded 12 points, second place awarded 10 points, third 8, and one point fewer per place <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> to a single point for tenth. In addition, the first four riders across the intermediate sprint lines earned points, 5, 3, 2, and 1 in succession.|$|E
5|$|Continuing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> {{the train}} passes the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad mine train roller coaster {{attraction}} and traverses a swing bridge, which crosses a canal {{that connects the}} Rivers of America to a boat servicing area. This bridge was originally located in Wabasso, Florida, and was previously owned by the Florida East Coast Railway. The train then runs through an area where numerous static and Audio-Animatronic displays of Native Americans and wild animals can be seen. After that, the train goes under an overpass, passes the spur line leading to the WDWRR's roundhouse where its trains are stored and maintained, and arrives at its next stop at Fantasyland Station.|$|E
5|$|This eventuality was foreseen. At the three-power Bermuda Conference with President Dwight D. Eisenhower in December 1953, the Prime Minister, Winston Churchill, {{suggested}} that the United States allow Britain {{to have access to}} American nuclear weapons to make up the shortfall. There were several technical and legal issues. For American bombs to be carried in British aircraft, the United States would have to disclose their weights and dimensions, while their delivery would require data concerning their ballistics. The release of such information was restricted by the McMahon Act. Further <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> there would also be issues of custody, security and targeting.|$|E
50|$|The field {{dimensions}} are 330 feet <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines,</b> 400 feet to center field and 370 {{feet in the}} power alleys. The facility includes batting cages and bullpens for both teams.|$|R

5|$|With {{the switch}} to a bigger 97 inch racket from 90 inches, Federer has gained easy power while relinquishing some control on his shots. The bigger racket has enabled easier serving and better defense on both wings with less shanks. However this has diminished his forehand, slice backhand and dropshot. Since his {{comeback}} in 2017, Federer is noted for his improved backhand both <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> and cross court which was cited {{as the reason for}} his defeat of Nadal in the 2017 Australian Open Final and Indian Wells 4th Round.|$|E
5|$|A pair of towers {{stand on}} the river's edge a short {{distance}} on either side from the main building. They were originally two-storyed open-backed structures with gun platforms situated on their first floors, providing flanking fire <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of the ditch around the castle's perimeter. They were later adapted for use as accommodation, with their backs closed with bricks and the towers increased in height to provide a third storey. Traces of the gun embrasures can still be seen {{at the point where}} the original roofline was. The South Tower was said to have been for the use of the castle's governor, though their lack of comfort meant that successive governors declined to live there. The two towers are linked to the main building by a crenallated curtain wall where additional cannon were emplaced in two embrasures on the north parapet and one on the south.|$|E
5|$|Before the 1910 season, Hugh Chalmers of Chalmers Automobile {{announced}} he would present a Chalmers Model 30 automobile to the player with the highest batting average {{at the end of}} the season. The 1910 race for best average in the American League was between Nap Lajoie of the Cleveland Indians and the Detroit Tigers' widely disliked Cobb. On the last day of the season, Lajoie overtook Cobb's batting average with seven bunt hits in a doubleheader against the St. Louis Browns. Browns' manager Jack O'Connor supposedly told his third baseman Red Corriden to play back <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> all day, which allowed Lajoie easy bunt hits. Cobb complained about the move, though American League President Ban Johnson said that a recalculation showed that Cobb had won the race anyway and Chalmers ultimately awarded cars to both players.|$|E
50|$|The field {{dimensions}} are 335 ft <b>down</b> <b>the</b> left-field <b>line,</b> 332 ft <b>down</b> <b>the</b> right-field <b>line,</b> and 402 ft to center-field. The playing surface is peppered with {{a maze of}} underground pipelines capable of draining up to 10 in of rain every hour.|$|R
50|$|Professional {{mediator}} Julia Ann Wambach uses Fuller's {{definition of}} rankism {{to explore the}} abuse of position within a hierarchy from both up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> of power, including how rankism feeds on itself in group contexts.|$|R
50|$|Strikers {{sought to}} disrupt service by cutting cables, {{lighting}} bonfires, and piling boulders, rubble, and other obstructions onto the tracks. St. Louis had significant union membership, and many working-class citizens shut <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>lines</b> {{in their own}} neighborhoods in solidarity.|$|R
5|$|It {{was late}} on 1 August when the British fleet {{appeared}} in the bay, and the French were at anchor in a strong defensive position. The French commander, Vice-Admiral François-Paul Brueys d'Aigalliers, did not expect a night attack, but Nelson ordered his ships to form up and attack {{the head of the}} French van, taking advantage of a favourable wind which allowed his ships to drift <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> while preventing the French rear from reinforcing the van and centre. Bellerophon was the eighth ship in the British line, and as the battle began, Darby turned her towards the French centre, eventually coming to anchor at 7 pm. Possibly due to some error {{on the part of the}} crew or because the anchor had dragged, Bellerophon came to rest alongside the French flagship, the 120-gun Orient.|$|E
5|$|On 5 May 1778, Dr. Lassonne, Marie Antoinette's private physician, {{confirmed}} her pregnancy. On 19 December 1778, the Queen {{gave birth}} to a daughter, who was named Marie-Thérèse Charlotte de France and given the honorific title Madame Royale. The birth of a girl came as a relief to the Count of Provence, who kept his position as heir to Louis XVI, since Salic Law excluded women from acceding to the throne of France. However, Louis Stanislas did not remain heir to the throne much longer. On 22 October 1781, Marie Antoinette {{gave birth to}} the Dauphin Louis Joseph. Louis Stanislas and his brother, the Count of Artois, served as godfathers by proxy for Joseph II, Holy Roman Emperor, the queen's brother. When Marie Antoinette gave birth to her second son, Louis Charles, in March 1785, Louis Stanislas slid further <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of succession.|$|E
5|$|For a {{transmission}} line carrying sinusoidal waves, {{the phase of}} the reflected wave is continually changing with distance, {{with respect to the}} incident wave, as it proceeds back <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> Because of this continuous change there are certain points on the line that the reflection will be in phase with the incident wave and the amplitude of the two waves will add. There will be other points where the two waves are in anti-phase and will consequently subtract. At these latter points the amplitude is at a minimum and they are known as nodes. If the incident wave has been totally reflected and the line is lossless, there will be complete cancellation at the nodes with zero signal present there despite the ongoing transmission of waves in both directions. The points where the waves are in phase are anti-nodes and represent a peak in amplitude. Nodes and anti-nodes alternate along the line and the combined wave amplitude varies continuously between them. The combined (incident plus reflected) wave appears to be standing still on the line and is called a standing wave.|$|E

5|$|In May 1908, Archibald Leitch {{wrote to}} the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) – who had a rail depot {{adjacent}} to the proposed site for the football ground – {{in an attempt to}} persuade them to subsidise construction of the grandstand alongside the railway line. The subsidy would have come to the sum of £10,000, to be paid back at the rate of £2,000 per annum for five years or half of the gate receipts for the grandstand each year until the loan was repaid. However, despite guarantees for the loan coming from the club itself and two local breweries, both chaired by club chairman John Henry Davies, the Cheshire Lines Committee turned the proposal down. The CLC had planned to build a new station adjacent to the new stadium, with the promise of an anticipated £2,750 per annum in fares offsetting the £9,800 cost of building the station. The station – Trafford Park – was eventually built, but further <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> than originally planned. The CLC later constructed a modest station with one timber-built platform immediately adjacent to the stadium and this opened on 21 August 1935. It was initially named United Football Ground, but was renamed Old Trafford Football Ground in early 1936. It was served on match days only by a shuttle service of steam trains from Manchester Central railway station. It is currently known as Manchester United Football Ground.|$|E
5|$|KG 53 {{approached}} North Weald {{from the}} east between Maldon, Essex and Rochford. No. 56 Squadron's 12 Hurricanes engaged the bombers, while No. 54 Squadron’s 11 Spitfires engaged the escorting Bf 109s and Bf 110s. In the engagement, at least one Bf 110 was shot <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> <b>line</b> of advance was now clear to the British ground controllers. Five Squadrons: No. 46, 85, 151, 257, and 310 with 61 Hurricanes, were scrambled to intercept the bombers in front of, or over the target. By 17:00 the airfield was covered in 5/10ths stratocumulus at 5,000 feet. Within thirty minutes the cloud base fell to just 3,500 feet. The German formation leaders soon realised {{that there was no}} hope of hitting a target from 12,000 feet, particularly when they could not see it. At 17:40, KG 53 turned away and headed for base. They had lost a single bomber to 56 Squadron. Things were about to change. As they turned around, 28 Hurricanes from Nos. 46, 85, and 151 Squadron prepared for a head-on attack. Meanwhile, 12 Hurricanes from 256 Squadron closed on the Germans from behind.|$|E

50|$|The city raised $13,500, with $6,000 budgeted {{to build}} the ballpark. Bernard Wisehall, a {{prominent}} local architect, designed Federal or Riverbreeze Park) with a capacity of 6,000. The playing field—bounded by East 2nd Street, East 3rd Street, Madison Avenue and Scott Boulevard—was tiny, possibly the smallest ever built for any pro baseball park. Its dimensions were just 194 feet <b>down</b> <b>the</b> right-field <b>line,</b> 267 feet to dead center, and 218 feet <b>down</b> <b>the</b> left-field <b>line.</b> Modern rules dictate no pro ballpark may have a fence closer than 325 feet, even <b>down</b> <b>the</b> foul <b>lines.</b> Construction did not begin until a month before opening day.|$|R
