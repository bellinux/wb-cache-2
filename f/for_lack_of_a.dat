5|$|Examination of the {{wreckage}} revealed that large portions of the wings' skin were badly glued and {{that a number of}} rib caps and stringers were not glued at all. Many panel pins were not connected to the structure at all and many of the bradawl holes necessary to equalize pressure between the inside of the wing and the outside were missing entirely. The crash of such an advanced aircraft shocked the entire industry and caused a six-month hiatus in design work. Polikarpov overreacted to its loss and built the structure of a number of his subsequent aircraft stronger, and thus, heavier, than it needed to be. All further work on the project was abandoned following the crash, nominally <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> suitable engine.|$|E
5|$|The French Democracy {{begins with}} a re-enactment of the real-life 27 October 2005 event that {{triggered}} riots in France: the electrocution of two teenagers, Zyed Benna and Bouna Traoré. In the film, the youths attempt to hide from police in a building near an electric power station. In a televised speech, the Minister of the Interior vows to increase efforts to fight crime. Three fictional Moroccan men discuss the recent events and disagree with means used by the police, and feel that blacks are unfairly targeted. They face different forms of discrimination: overnight detention <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> passport during an identity check, refusal of employment and housing rental, and police brutality. Angered, the three riot using Molotov cocktails. A white family watches television coverage of the chaos, and the film ends with a dedication to Benna and Traoré, lamenting {{the loss of the}} French ideals of freedom, equality, and fraternity.|$|E

25|$|Dosage of {{chemotherapy}} can be difficult: If the dose is too low, {{it will be}} ineffective against the tumor, whereas, at excessive doses, the toxicity (side-effects) will be intolerable to the patient. The standard method of determining chemotherapy dosage is based on calculated body surface area (BSA). The BSA is usually calculated with a mathematical formula or a nomogram, using a patient's weight and height, rather than by direct measurement of body mass. This formula was originally derived in a 1916 study and attempted to translate medicinal doses established with laboratory animals to equivalent doses for humans. The study only included 9 human subjects. When chemotherapy {{was introduced in the}} 1950s, the BSA formula was adopted as the official standard for chemotherapy dosing <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> better option.|$|E

25|$|In response, the Legislative Council {{proposed}} {{to restrict the}} right of such persons by adding another requirement {{that one of the}} child's parents must have been a permanent resident {{at the time of the}} child's birth. On 10 July 1997, the Legislative Council passed the Immigration Amendment (No. 3) Ordinance, which introduced a certification system. Under this system, any person who claimed to have the right of abode in Hong Kong could prove their status only by showing a certificate of right of abode issued by the Director of Immigration of Hong Kong. This certificate could be applied for only in mainland China, and it would not be issued until the application obtained a one-way permit to cross the border to Hong Kong from the Chinese Public Security Bureau. The amendment was made retroactive to 1 July 1997, which meant that even children who had already arrived in Hong Kong with previously sufficient legal documentation would have been stripped of their right <b>for</b> <b>lack</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> certificate that did not yet exist when they entered Hong Kong. The retroactivity of the amendment triggered a number of test cases in court, which eventually came before the Court of Final Appeal as Ng Ka Ling v. Director of Immigration and Chan Kam Nga v.
