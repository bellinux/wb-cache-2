With adequate physical fitness maintaining chemotherapy during lung cancer palliation offers 1.5 to 3 months of prolongation of survival, symptomatic relief, and an improvement in quality of life, with better results seen with modern agents. The NSCLC Meta-Analyses Collaborative Group recommends if the recipient wants and can tolerate treatment, then chemotherapy should be considered <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> NSCLC.|$|E

5|$|Grown {{in liquid}} culture, Crucibulum laeve {{produces}} bioactive chemicals called salfredins that are structurally related to benzofuran and chromene, molecules that contain cyclic amide or lactone five-membered ring structures; these compounds {{are unique to}} this species. Salfredin B11 was first identified in 1995, while later research confirmed the presence of additional salfredin-type metabolites. These compounds are inhibitors of aldose reductase, an enzyme that has been implicated {{in the formation of}} cataracts <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> stages of diabetes mellitus.

5|$|In {{the earlier}} {{stages of the}} disease, the biopsy {{typically}} shows steatosis (deposition of fatty material), increased glycogen in the nucleus, and areas of necrosis (cell death).

In acute liver failure, degeneration of the liver cells and collapse of the liver tissue architecture is seen, typically on a background of cirrhotic changes. Histochemical methods for detecting copper are inconsistent and unreliable, and taken alone are regarded as insufficient to establish a diagnosis.|$|E
5|$|Levodopa and {{proteins}} use {{the same}} transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, thereby competing for access.

Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive protein consumption is discouraged and well balanced Mediterranean diet is recommended. <b>In</b> <b>advanced</b> stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa should be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch, allowing protein intake in the evening.|$|E

5|$|Since its introduction, {{the euro}} {{has been the}} second most widely held {{international}} reserve currency after the U.S. dollar. The share of the euro as a reserve currency increased from 18% in 1999 to 27% in 2008.

The euro inherited and built {{on the status of}} the Deutsche Mark as the second most important reserve currency. The euro remains underweight as a reserve currency <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> economies while overweight in emerging and developing economies: according to the International Monetary Fund the total of euro held as a reserve in the world at the end of 2008 was equal to $1.1trillion or €850 billion, with a share of 22% of all currency reserves <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> economies, but a total of 31% of all currency reserves in emerging and developing economies.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemotherapy}} regimen {{depends on}} the tumor type. Small-cell lung carcinoma (SCLC), even relatively early stage disease, is treated primarily with chemotherapy and radiation. In SCLC, cisplatin and etoposide are most commonly used. Combinations with carboplatin, gemcitabine, paclitaxel, vinorelbine, topotecan, and irinotecan are also used. <b>In</b> <b>advanced</b> non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), chemotherapy improves survival and is used as first-line treatment, provided the person is well enough for the treatment. Typically, two drugs are used, of which one is often platinum-based (either cisplatin or carboplatin). Other commonly used drugs are gemcitabine, paclitaxel, docetaxel, pemetrexed, etoposide or vinorelbine.|$|E

50|$|The Thurstonian {{approach}} motivated Frijter (1979)'s {{explanation of}} Gridgeman's Paradox, {{also known as}} the paradox of discriminatory nondiscriminators: People perform better in a three-alternative forced choice task when told <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> which dimension of the stimulus to attend to. (For example, people are better at identifying which of one three drinks is different from the other two when told <b>in</b> <b>advance</b> that the difference will be in degree of sweetness.) This result is accounted for by differing cognitive strategies: when the relevant dimension is known <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> people can estimate values along that particular dimension. When the relevant dimension is not known <b>in</b> <b>advance,</b> they must rely on a more general, multi-dimensional measure of sensory distance.|$|R

5|$|The {{genitalia}} of {{the male}} and female in any particular species are adapted to fit each other like a lock (male) and key (female). In males, the ninth abdominal segment is divided into a dorsal 'tegumen' and ventral 'viniculum'.

The male has a median tubular organ (called the aedeagus) which is extended through an eversible sheath (or 'vesica') to inseminate the female. The males have paired sperm ducts in all lepidopterans; the paired testes are separate in basal taxa and fused <b>in</b> <b>advanced</b> forms.|$|E
