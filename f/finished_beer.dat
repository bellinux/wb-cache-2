2500|$|Malt {{is often}} {{divided into two}} {{categories}} by brewers: base malts and specialty malts; base malts have enough diastatic power to convert their own starch and usually that of some amount of starch from unmalted grain, called adjuncts, while specialty malts have little diastatic power, but provide flavor, color, or [...] "body" [...] (viscosity) to the <b>finished</b> <b>beer.</b> Specialty caramel or crystal malts {{have been subjected to}} heat treatment to convert their starches to sugars nonenzymatically. Within these categories is a variety of types distinguished largely by the kilning temperature (see mash ingredients).|$|E
2500|$|Alpha and beta {{amylases}} {{are important}} in brewing beer and liquor made from sugars derived from starch. [...] In fermentation, yeast ingest sugars and excrete alcohol. [...] In beer and some liquors, the sugars present {{at the beginning of}} fermentation have been produced by [...] "mashing" [...] grains or other starch sources (such as potatoes). [...] In traditional beer brewing, malted barley is mixed with hot water to create a [...] "mash," [...] which is held at a given temperature to allow the amylases in the malted grain to convert the barley's starch into sugars. [...] Different temperatures optimize the activity of alpha or beta amylase, resulting in different mixtures of fermentable and unfermentable sugars. [...] In selecting mash temperature and grain-to-water ratio, a brewer can change the alcohol content, mouthfeel, aroma, and flavor of the <b>finished</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Kräusening is a {{conditioning}} {{method in}} which fermenting wort {{is added to}} the <b>finished</b> <b>beer.</b> The active yeast will restart fermentation in the <b>finished</b> <b>beer,</b> and so introduce fresh carbon dioxide; the conditioning tank will be then sealed so that the carbon dioxide is dissolved into the beer producing a lively [...] "condition" [...] or level of carbonation. The kräusening method may also be used to condition bottled beer.|$|E
50|$|The iso-alpha acids have {{no effect}} on Gram-negative bacteria, and {{therefore}} the brewer must rely on maintaining proper sanitiation and anaerobic conditions of the <b>finished</b> <b>beer</b> to ensure shelf stability.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} a retrieval processing of technology options that are applied {{in the production of}} beer in industrial breweries and microbreweries. The development of brewing in the Olomouc region after 1990 is also included in this thesis as well as development trends and status of microbreweries and industrial breweries in the area. The work is focused on comparing the possibilities of technologies in breweries with different production capacity. Discussed are mainly technologies and biotechnologies of preparation of wort, fermentation and <b>finishing</b> <b>beer...</b>|$|R
50|$|A brewer {{may also}} use {{some form of}} animal product in the later stages of beer processing, such as {{glycerol}} monostearate, {{which is used to}} create a foam or head on the <b>finished</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{vigorous}} fermentation, {{a sufficient}} quantity of FAN must {{be present in}} the wort. An excessive concentration in the wort is not desirable however, as this may cause production of a significant quantity of fusel alcohols, or spoilage of the <b>finished</b> <b>beer</b> by other organisms.|$|E

5000|$|Genesee Cream Ale {{is a cold}} fermented, alcohlic {{beverage}} {{produced by}} the Genesee Brewing Company in Rochester, NY. It is a light bodied ale. It was first introduced in late 1960. Genesee's brewmasters take an extra step of kräusening, {{a process in which}} <b>finished</b> <b>beer</b> is primed for carbonation with wort instead of sugar.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} beers claim an Irish {{provenance}} or are commissioned by Irish companies, but are produced outside Ireland. In the past these have included Árainn Mhór beers and Time Lager. Today, the Strangford Lough Brewing Company produces a concentrated wort which they export to the UK and US where contract breweries {{turn it into}} <b>finished</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|E
50|$|Finishing — Finally, the brewer {{is ready}} to <b>finish</b> the <b>beer.</b> The beer is {{filtered}} one last time; it is then carbonated and moved into a storage tank for either bottling or kegging.|$|R

50|$|Milk stout (also called sweet stout, mellow stout or cream stout) is a stout {{containing}} lactose, a sugar {{derived from}} milk. Lactose cannot be fermented by brewers' yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), and the residue adds sweetness, body and calories to the <b>finished</b> <b>beer.</b> Mackeson still bears on its label the milk churn {{that has been}} its trademark since it was first brewed in 1907.|$|E
5000|$|The {{next step}} up from extract brewing {{is to use a}} diastatically active malt extract to convert {{starches}} from other beer adjuncts such as flaked and torrified barleys, flaked and torrified wheat, wheat flour, and flaked oats into fermentable sugars. These extracts are currently only available in the canned form. Unmalted barleys and wheats can add extra [...] "body" [...] to a <b>finished</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|E
50|$|In {{the process}} of brewing beer, trub is the term used for the material, along with hop debris, left in the {{whirlpool}} or hopback after the wort has been boiled then transferred and cooled. Brewers generally prefer {{that the bulk of}} the trub be left in the whirlpool rather than stay in contact with the fermenting wort. Although it contains yeast nutrients, its presence can impart off-flavors in the <b>finished</b> <b>beer.</b>|$|E

50|$|Pumpkin ale is {{a popular}} style of beer in the United States. Pumpkin ale may be {{produced}} using pumpkin flesh in combination with malt or other more typical beer grains as {{a portion of the}} mash bill, contributing fermentable sugars to the wort. It may also be produced by adding natural or artificial flavor to a <b>finished</b> <b>beer.</b> Spice flavor may be added to evoke the flavor of pumpkin pie, a popular American wintertime dessert.|$|E
50|$|The brewery's copper boiling kettles {{date from}} the 1920s, {{but there are also}} a number of pieces of modern {{equipment}} in use in the brewhouse. Square, flat-bottomed fermentation tanks of stainless steel are utilized to provide specific flavor characteristics that are evident in the <b>finished</b> <b>beer.</b> Primary fermentation lasts about 5 days, followed by a 1-2 week secondary fermentation. After this, the beer is packaged and warm-aged at the brewery for 6-8 weeks at 73 °F(23 °C). All of Dupont's beers are naturally carbonated via bottle conditioning.|$|E
