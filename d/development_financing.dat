25|$|Critics {{of nuclear}} power claim {{that it is the}} {{beneficiary}} of inappropriately large economic subsidies, taking the form of research and <b>development,</b> <b>financing</b> support for building new reactors and decommissioning old reactors and waste, and that these subsidies are often overlooked when comparing the economics of nuclear against other forms of power generation. Nuclear power proponents argue that competing energy sources also receive subsidies. Fossil fuels receive large direct and indirect subsidies, such as tax benefits and not having to pay for the greenhouse gases they emit. Renewables receive proportionately large direct production subsidies and tax breaks in many nations, although in absolute terms they are often less than subsidies received by other sources.|$|E
25|$|The Big Six major {{studios are}} today {{primarily}} backers and distributors of films whose actual production is largely handled by independent companies—either long-running entities or ones created for and {{dedicated to the}} making of a specific film. The specialty divisions often simply acquire distribution rights to pictures in which the studio has had no prior involvement. While the majors still do a modicum of true production, their activities are focused more in the areas of <b>development,</b> <b>financing,</b> marketing, and merchandising. Those business functions are still usually performed in or near Los Angeles, even though the runaway production phenomenon means that most films are now mostly or completely shot on location at places outside Los Angeles.|$|E

2500|$|In 2005, under {{financial}} {{pressure from}} its charity involvements and rising costs, the SVCMC system filed for bankruptcy. [...] The system launched an aggressive reorganization effort, selling or transferring its money-losing facilities and focusing development on its main hospital, which {{allowed it to}} emerge from bankruptcy {{in the summer of}} 2007. [...] In the name of modernizing and restructuring, it also announced plans to build a new Manhattan hospital across the street, with a planned opening set for 2011. Part of this redevelopment was to include construction of a billion-dollar residential condominium by the Rudin real estate family. The plan was a source of contention with several neighborhood groups, such as the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation and the Municipal Art Society. The Landmarks Preservation Commission approved the residential components of the plan in July 2009, but by then residential <b>development</b> <b>financing</b> was no longer available because of the global financial crisis.|$|E
