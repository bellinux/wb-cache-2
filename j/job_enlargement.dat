50|$|<b>Job</b> <b>enlargement</b> means {{increasing}} {{the scope of}} a job through extending the range of its job duties and responsibilities generally within the same level and periphery. <b>Job</b> <b>enlargement</b> involves combining various activities {{at the same level}} in the organization and adding them to the existing job. It is also called the horizontal expansion of job activities. This contradicts the principles of specialisation and the division of labour whereby work is divided into small units, each of which is performed repetitively by an individual worker and the responsibilities are always clear. Some motivational theories suggest that the boredom and alienation caused by the division of labour can actually cause efficiency to fall. Thus, <b>job</b> <b>enlargement</b> seeks to motivate workers through reversing the process of specialisation. A typical approach might be to replace assembly lines with modular work; instead of an employee repeating the same step on each product, they perform several tasks on a single item.

De façon générale, les positions syndicales sont favorables et elles ont évolué en ce sens au cours des dernières années. La volonté de s'adapter à un environnement changeant, la position de la centrale syndicale et l'expérience passée sont les facteurs qui expliquent le mieux les variations des positions syndicales locales.

Is it correct to claim that the latter have changed?In November 1991, questionnaire was sent to a sample of 266 offîcers from various local unions in the Quebec's manufacturing sector. These offîcers belong to local unions with more than 50 members and affiliated to the QFL, the CNTU or the CDU. A total of 114 questionnaires were returned including 63 from the QFL, 39 from the CNTU and 20 from the CDU. Key findings from the data and from statistical analysis include the following. The NFWO most often introduced were: total quality (54 %), <b>job</b> enrichment and <b>enlargement</b> (50 %), <b>job</b> rotation (49 %), quality circles (44 %) and flexibility between trades (44 %). After their introduction, initiatives were maintained in the majority of cases (85 %), with the exception of the quality circles (50 % of cases). NFWO are normally introduced outside the collective bargaining process. Offîcers expressed favourable positions concerning quality of working life, favourable but critical position concerning job rotation and total quality management, critical (ambivalent) positions vis-à-vis <b>job</b> enrichment/jobs <b>enlargement</b> and flexibility between trades, and defensive positions regarding quality circles. Factor analysis resulted in two groupings of officer's positions, the first including initiatives related to the allocation of work and the second to quality. The results of linear regression analysis suggest that policies related to the first group were positively influenced by the officer's willingness to adapt to his/her environment and by the position of his/her labour confederation. For the second group, the position of the labour confederation exerted a negative influence and the officer's experience with NFWO a positive influence.

40|$|Interventions or {{programs}} {{to improve the}} organization of work and reduce the impact of stressful jobs on our health can be conducted {{in a wide variety}} of ways. Changes can be made at the level of the job, at the level of the organization, at a more individual level, or from outside the organization through laws and regulations. The U. S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed a summary of levels of interventions and categories of prevention (Table 1) [1]. The author’s additions to NIOSH’s original version of this table are in italics. Within each level, interventions can be considered primary, secondary, or tertiary prevention. Primary prevention refers to efforts to protect the health of people who have not yet become sick. Secondary prevention involves early detection and prompt and effective efforts to correct the beginning stages of illness (for example, reversing high blood pressure, buildup of plaque in the arteries, or chronic insomnia, before a heart attack occurs). Tertiary prevention consists of measures to reduce or eliminate long-term impairments and disabilities and minimize suffering after illness has occurred (for example, rehabilitation and return-to-work after a heart attack) [2]. Historically, legislative/policy interventions have been more common in Europe [3] and Japan [4] than the United States [5], with exceptions, such as U. S. state laws banning mandatory overtime or providing minimum staffing levels for nurses, or the new California paid family leave law [6]. In the United States, ergonomics regulations have also addressed issues of work organization, although such efforts have been very general and have met with considerable resistance [5]. The only existing state regulation, the California Standard on Repetitive Motion Injuries, requires that “the employer shall consider engineering controls [...] . and adminis-trative controls, such as job rotation, work pacing or work breaks. ” The OSHA Ergonomics Program Standard, rescinded in 2001, describes administrative controls for musculoskeletal disorder risk including “employee rotation, rest breaks, 193 alternative tasks, <b>job</b> task <b>enlargement,</b> redesign of work methods and adjustment of work pace ” [5]...|$|R

40|$|L'auteur commente l'article de Normand Cinq-Mars«  Négociation locale et négociation sectorielle » Relations industrielles, volume 25, numéro 3, 1970. There seems, {{over the}} past few years, to have arisen in Canada a grawing {{interest}} in Industry-wide bargaining. In Québec the government has explicitly stated its intention to encourage (through legislation) such a type of structure. A large number of advantages are alleged to flow from this « rational » approach as compared the traditional plant or local bargaining relationships. The author recognizes that such a shift could result in certain improvements, In the event of layoffs or complete plant shutdowns older workers may obtain wider bumping rights if the seniority unit is thereby enlarged. In this way {{the average age of the}} disemployed may drop, the age mix of the unemployed having been altered. Since retraining and mobility programs are likely to be more successful with younger workers, this change could represent a social gain. There remains of course the thorny issue of equity and compensation for the losers. Industry-wide certification - accompanied by appropriate changes in the majority requirements - may also extend the opportunity of collective bargaining to new sectors where plants are too small, turnover rates too high, and employer power too extensive to permit workers to even think seriously of unionization under the present regime. We should not underestimate the attachment of workers to seniority as the only meaningful proxy for <b>job</b> security. <b>Enlargement</b> of the seniority unit, to the extent that it heightens the state of insecurity of all but the older workers, will have to be compensated for by other ingredients of the job security concept. One such response might be that the (federal) government adhere honestly and explicitly to its 1946 commitment to maintain a full employment. Tight full employment combined with a meaningful and active manpower policy program would create the kind of environment in which workers do not fear dilution of their present seniority arrangements. Recent performance of our governments, mysteriously stricken with a pathological inflation phobia, have driven worker job securitybelow tolerable levels !One of the « advantages » seen to flow from industry-wide bargaining is a reduction in the number of strikes. This is a simplistic mathematical truism. The strike unit would of course be larger and the man-days lost would thus not be expected to fail. Of great interest here is that strikes would shut down entire industries rather that single plants. This more complete interruption of product flow would surely increase the « public interest » element in such a conflict. This would promote greater direct government intervention in collective bargaining, an undesirable development on almosta priori grounds alone. While on the subject of eliminating or reducing strike activity, it is necessary to point out that it is wholly illusory to pretend that this is necessarily desirable. Surely strikes are but one form of costly industrial conflict. Indeed, if enlargement of the bargaining unit does mean a reduction of strike activity we should anticipate that conflict will merely change its form. Among these other (substitute) forms of conflictual activity we find ;(1) a lowering of worker morale (frustration)  ;(2) a reduction in effort or productivity ;(3) an increase in grievances;(4) an increase in turnover rates ;(5) an increase in absenteeism ;(6) an increase in spoilage and breakage ;(7) an increase in accident rates ;(8) an increase in thefts;(9) an increase in sabotage ;(10) strikes that do break out (legal and illegal) will tend to be more violent. These aggressive manifestations result in increased costs of production, and where possible, increased prices. In the end, all parties in the market pay the price whether the conflict is open and explicit or hidden and implicitThe most potent argument against industry-wide bargaining is that it inevitably results in an upward displacement of the locus of power within the union hierarchy. The many advocates of the broader structure underestimate the dangers for the trade union movement of an even greater centralization of power than exists today. Most members are already alienated as citizens, as workers, and we are asked to witness a further alienation of the individual as union member. If a more concentrated power base is indeed imposed, this author predicts that the lower echelon leaders and the rank and file will create a (n) (informal) parallel structure while the existing unions will care for the « social » welfare rather than the narrow members' interests. Unions are institutions whose first (and almost only) role is to advance the interests of their members. They are not intended to occupy themselves with the « common good ». It is a matter of the allocation of private resources on the basis of a priority ranking...|$|R

50|$|Job {{enrichment}} can be contrasted to <b>job</b> <b>enlargement</b> which simply {{increases the}} number of tasks without changing the challenge.

40|$|Cyclic {{assembly}} work {{is known to}} imply a high risk for musculoskeletal disorders. To have operators rotate between work tasks {{is believed to be}} one way of decreasing this risk, since it is expected to increase variation in mechanical and psychological exposures (physical and mental loads). This assumption was investigated by assessing mechanical exposure variability in three assembly tasks in an electronics assembly plant, each on a separate workstation, as well as in a 'job enlargement' scenario combining all three stations. Five experienced operators worked for 1 h on each station. Data on upper trapezius and forearm extensor muscle activity were obtained by means of electromyography (EMG), and working postures of the head and upper arms were assessed by inclinometry. The cycle-to-cycle variance of parameters representing the three exposure dimensions: level, frequency and duration was estimated using ANOVA algorithms for each workstation separately as well as for a balanced combination of all three. For a particular station, the variability of trapezius EMG activity levels relative to the mean was higher than for extensor EMG: between-cycles coefficients of variation (CV) about 0. 15 and 0. 10, respectively. A similar relationship between CV applied to the parameter describing frequency of EMG activity. Except for head inclination levels, the between-cycles CV was larger for posture parameters than for EMG. The between-cycles variance increased up to six fold in the <b>job</b> <b>enlargement</b> scenario, as compared to working at only one station.
