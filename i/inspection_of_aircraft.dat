The operator must then visually diagnose {{the presence or absence of}} defects. This approach avoids the use of platforms to observe the upper parts of the aeroplane.|$|E

5|$|Aircraft are {{inspected}} during {{maintenance operations}} either outdoors on an airport between flights, or in a hangar for longer-duration inspections. These inspections are conducted mainly by human operators, visually and sometimes using tools to assess defects.

A database dedicated to each aircraft type, containing images and three-dimensional scans, will be updated after each maintenance.

5000|$|Borescopes are {{commonly}} used in the visual <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> engines, aeroderivative industrial gas turbines, steam turbines, diesel engines, and automotive and truck engines. Gas and steam turbines require particular attention because of safety and maintenance requirements. Borescope inspection of engines {{can be used to}} prevent unnecessary maintenance, which can become extremely costly for large turbines. They are also used in manufacturing of machined or cast parts to inspect critical interior surfaces for burrs, surface finish or complete through-holes. Other common uses include forensic applications in law enforcement and building inspection, and in gunsmithing for inspecting the interior bore of a firearm. In World War II, primitive rigid borescopes were used to examine the interior bores (hence [...] "bore" [...] scope) of large guns for defects.|$|E

40|$|Visual {{inspection}} is {{the most}} widely used method in commercial aircraft surface inspection. We have developed a prototype remote visual inspection system, designed to facilitate testing the feasibility and advantages of remote visual <b>inspection</b> <b>of</b> <b>aircraft</b> surfaces.
