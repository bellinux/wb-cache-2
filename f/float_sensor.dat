The system comprises a microcontroller. three water level float sensors, two valves, a water pump and a siren. The system enables flood water to be diverted to two alternative channels with the use of two valves. The pump is activated once the water level exceeds the predetermined limit.

We propose a Restricted <b>Floating</b> <b>Sensors</b> (RFS) model in which sensor nodes are anchored to the sea bottom, floating within a restricted area. Distinguished from traditional stationary or mobile sensor networks, the RFS network consists of sensor nodes with restricted mobility. We construct the network model and elaborate the corresponding localization problem.

40|$|Abstract—In-situ data {{collection}} for mobile {{wireless sensor network}} deployments has received little study, {{such as in the}} case of <b>floating</b> <b>sensor</b> networks for storm surge and innundation monitoring. We demonstrate through quantitative study that traditional approaches to routing in mobile environments do not work well due to volatile topology changes. Consequently, we propose Sidewinder, a predictive data forwarding protocol for mobile wireless sensor networks. Like a heat-seeking missile, data packets are guided towards a sink node with increasing accuracy as packets approach the sink. Different from conventional sensor network routing protocols, Sidewinder continuously predicts the current sink location based on distributed knowledge of sink mobility among nodes in a multi-hop routing process. Moreover, the continuous sink estimation is scaled and adjusted to perform with resource-constrained wireless sensors. Our design is implemented with nesC and evaluated in TOSSIM. The performance evaluation demonstrates that Sidewinder significantly outperforms state-of-the-art solutions in packet delivery ratio, time delay, and energy efficiency. I...|$|R

40|$|We {{present an}} {{electrokinetic}} framework for designing insulator constriction-based dielectrophoresis devices with enhanced ability to trap nanoscale biomolecules in physiological media of high conductivity, through coupling short-range dielectrophoresis forces with long-range electrothermal flow. While a 500 -fold constriction enables field focusing sufficient to trap nanoscale biomolecules by dielectrophoresis, {{the extent of}} this high-field region is enhanced through coupling the constriction to an electrically <b>floating</b> <b>sensor</b> electrode at the constriction floor. However, the enhanced localized fields due to the constriction and enhanced current within saline media of high conductivity (1 [*]S/m) cause a rise in temperature due to Joule heating, resulting in a hotspot region midway within the channel depth at the constriction center, with temperatures of ∼ 8 °– 10 °K above the ambient. While the resulting vortices from electrothermal flow are directed away from the hotspot region to oppose dielectrophoretic trapping, they also cause a downward and inward flow towards the electrode edges at the constriction floor. This assists biomolecular trapping at the sensor electrode through enabling long-range fluid sampling {{as well as through}} localized stirring by fluid circulation in its vicinity...|$|R

Physical obstacles, including the shoreline and natural vegetation, present a major challenge to operating mobile sensors in estuarial environments. Actuated mobile sensors are shown to be a viable solution; appropriate control techniques allow these sensors to avoid obstacles, meet navigational goals, and still collect the Lagrangian data necessary for the sensing objective.

40|$|Pipelines {{present a}} unique {{challenge}} to monitoring {{because of the}} great geographical distances they cover, their burial depth, their age, {{and the need to}} keep the product flowing without much interruption. Most other engineering structures that require monitoring do not pose such combined challenges. In this regard, a pipeline system can be considered analogous to the blood vessels in the human body. The human body has an extensive ''pipeline'' through which blood and other fluids are transported. The brain can generally sense damage to the system at any location and alert the body to provide temporary repair, unless the damage is severe. This is accomplished through a vast network of fixed and <b>floating</b> <b>sensors</b> combined with a vast and extremely complex communication/decision making system. The project described in this report mimics the distributed sensor system of our body, albeit in a much more rudimentary fashion. Internal corrosion {{is an important factor in}} pipeline integrity management. At present, the methods to assess internal corrosion in pipelines all have certain limitations. In-line inspection tools are costly and cannot be used in all pipelines. Because there is a significant time interval between inspections, any impact due to upsets in pipeline operations can be missed. Internal Corrosion Direct Assessment (ICDA) is a procedure that can be used to identify locations of possible internal corrosion. However, the uncertainties in the procedure require excavation and location of damage using more detailed inspection tools. Non-intrusive monitoring techniques can be used to monitor internal corrosion, but these tools also require pipeline excavation and are limited in the spatial extent of corrosion they can examine. Therefore, a <b>floating</b> <b>sensor</b> system that can deposit at locations of water accumulation and communicate the corrosion information to an external location is needed. To accomplish this, the project is divided into four main tasks related to wireless data transmission, corrosion sensor development, sensor system motion and delivery, and consideration of other pipeline operations issues. In the first year of the program, focus was on sensor development and wireless data transmission. The second year of the program, which was discontinued due to funding shortfall, would have focused on further wireless transmission development, packaging of sensor on wireless, and other operational issues. Because, the second year funding has been discontinued, recommendations are made for future studies...|$|R
40|$|The Wastewater Collection System (WCS) {{has long}} been {{recognized}} as one of the critical infrastructures in the urban fabric, along with fresh water and power system infrastructure. An aging Wastewater Collection System may jeopardize public and environmental health by contaminating the sources of drinking water and by polluting the natural environment. Although the largest part of WCS failures are caused by aging infrastructure, careless dumping can lead to explosions and cause major catastrophes. Moreover, there is a growing consensus that greenhouse gas (GHG) generated from the wastewater infrastructure represents a significant fraction of GHG emissions. While a WCS failure can cause unimaginable hardship, systematic monitoring of the WCS has made little progress over the years due to several challenges that include invisibility, harsh environment, vast geographical span, and the requirement of minimizing service interruption. Thus far, various schemes have been designed and developed to monitor WCS (e. g., robots, Closed Circuit TV (CCTV)). However, due to the cost and the complications associated with these techniques, only a fraction of WCS areinspected each year. To address some of these issues we propose a novel WCS monitoring method based on mobile pipeline <b>floating</b> <b>sensors</b> named; SewerSnort together with wireless manhole beacons/base stations. SewerSnort is dropped upstream of the WCS and traverses a path in the WCS network. While traveling downstream, the sensor detects emergency conditions (leaks, spills, illegal dumps, and dangerous methane gas concentration) and notifies base stations along the way. Also, the data is carried to the destination (i. e., treatment plant) where it is analyzed to detect anomalies. In this work, we design a wireless mobile pipeline <b>floating</b> <b>sensor</b> unit SewerSnort which is a fully automated and end-to-end monitoring solution; develop a GPS-free radio-frequency based localization scheme inside pipelines; develop an algorithm to detect WCS functional deficiencies; develop a simulation tool to assist field deployment; and develop a radio propagation model to estimate the radio channel quality inside sewer environment. The simulator provides tools to analyze scenarios; to trace the path of SewerSnort; to develop a mobility model for a convoy of SewerSnorts; and to visualize SewerSnort movement in real-time and monitor the in-sewer incidents. Also, possible applications of SewerSnort to real-world problem such as illegal dumping, improving the accuracy of GHG emission e stimates, and performing preventive WCS monitoring, are presented to mitigate or to address our important environmental issues...|$|R
