40|$|At {{the present}} time there are various thermal spray {{coatings}} in use for wear and corrosion protection, these coatings contain inherent porosity which could be detrimental to their performance. Plasma sprayed chromium oxide coatings are currently used within the paper, mining and materials industries; they provide <b>good</b> <b>wear</b> and corrosion <b>resistance,</b> although they are still susceptible to failure. This work focuses on thermal sprayed nickel based coatings deposited using flame spray and High Velocity Oxy-Fuel (HVOF) techniques. They were then processed with a flame or laser heat treatment process called fusing to create a dense, pore free and strongly bonded microstructure. This is to overcome the shortcomings present in the chromium oxide thermal spray coatings to provide a <b>good</b> <b>wear</b> and corrosion resistant coating. Laser cladding of the Ni-based coatings was also performed to observe the potential use in depositing these coatings. Dense, pore free microstructures were produced with laser cladding process. A coating adhesion testing method was developed to determine the bonding strength of these fused coatings (thermal sprayed followed by fusing process). The coatings were placed in a salt spray fog corrosion chamber to observe their corrosion resistance; to rank and compare them to coatings currently used in the paper and mining and materials industries. The same coatings were subjected to a pin-on-disk wear test to observe their <b>wear</b> <b>resistance</b> performance. Corrosion testing showed that flame and laser fused coatings had good corrosion resistance along with Cr 2 O 3.

Wear testing demonstrated the low wear of chromium oxide coatings, while {{it was possible to}} obtain comparable wear results with laser fused nickel based coatings. Some flame fused coatings demonstrated high wear due to pull out of tungsten carbide particles present in the coating.
