50|$|Research {{in nuclear}} {{propulsion}} began with studies for nuclear thermal propulsion, where the reactor heated a propellant (usually hydrogen) that {{was allowed to}} expand through a nozzle. This was essentially an ordinary chemical rocket with the nuclear reaction replacing chemical combustion as the rocket's heat source. Because the reactor could supply more heat to the propellant than chemical combustion, higher exhaust velocities, i.e., higher specific impulses, were possible. See KIWI, NERVA. The reports at the time (and since) indicated that keeping the system light would require high-temperature, densely packed designs, such as fast metal-cooled reactors or <b>hexagonal</b> <b>pin</b> fueled, high temperature gas-cooled reactors. In {{the past several decades}} the attention has turned to using the nuclear reactor to drive a turbine to produce electricity, which is used to create a plasma which is accelerated. See Project Prometheus. The present best of tech is the SAFE-400, which uses a 400 kW thermal reactor and a gas turbine (called a closed Brayton cycle) to produce electric power. Heat rejection is kept low-mass using advanced heat pipe systems (such as are now used in some laptop computers for cooling as well). Safety comes from ruggedness, proper shielding, control pins and spoiler pins inside the reactor which arrest the reaction.|$|E

The developed models used for the analytical investigations considered the welding process as a combination or mixture of the pure sliding and the pure sticking. From the results, the amount of heat generation and the peak temperature are directly proportional {{to the number of}} edges in the pin profiles {{in such a way that}} the heat generated and peak temperature in the profiles increases from the triangular pin profile to <b>hexagonal</b> <b>pin</b> profile. Also, the rate of heat generation and the peak temperature in flat shoulder are greater than in tapered/conical shoulder. The results in this work are validated with experimental and the past theoretical results and good agreements are achieved...|$|E
40|$|In this work, {{improved}} {{heat generation}} models are developed for straight and tapered shoulder geometries with different tool pin profiles in friction stir welding. The models are developed considering the welding {{process as a}} combination of the pure sliding and the pure sticking conditions. From the results, the amount of heat generation is directly proportional to the number of edges in the pin profiles {{in such a way that}} the heat generated in the profiles increases from the triangular pin profile to <b>hexagonal</b> <b>pin</b> profile. Also, increase in the tool rotational speed under constant weld speed increases the heat input while increase in the weld speed under constant tool rotational speed decreases the heat input and the rate of heat generation at the shoulder in a flat shoulder tool is more than that of conical/tapered shoulder tool.

In this investigation, {{an attempt}} using data envelopment {{analysis}} based Taguchi method, is involved in solving the multi-response optimization of the process parameters of rotational speed, transverse speed, tool tilt angle with different tool pin profiles on the stir zone evolution in AA 8011 Aluminium alloys. Three different tool <b>pin</b> profiles (<b>hexagonal,</b> pentagonal <b>pin</b> profiles of High Carbon High Chromium steel and <b>Hexagonal</b> tool <b>pin</b> profile of H 13 steel) {{have been used to}} make the joints at the different combination of process parameters using L 9 orthogonal array. The Vickers hardness and Impact strength are measured to optimize the process parameters using DEA based Taguchi method.

40|$|Using {{molecular}} dynamics simulations, we analyze {{the effects of}} artificial periodic arrays of pinning sites on the critical current of superconducting thin films {{as a function of}} vortex density. We analyze two types of periodic <b>pinning</b> arrays: <b>hexagonal</b> and Kagomé. For the Kagome pinning network we calculate, using two directions of transport current: longitudinal and transversal. Our results show that the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>pinning</b> array presents higher critical currents than Kagomé and random pinning configuration for all vortex densities. In addition, the Kagomé network shows anisotropy in their transport properties...|$|R
40|$|The {{critical}} current and melting temperature of a vortex system are analyzed. Calculations {{are made for}} a two dimensional film at finite temperature with two kinds of periodic pinning: hexagonal and Kagomé. A transport current parallel and perpendicular to the main axis of the pinning arrays is applied and molecular dynamics simulations are {{used to calculate the}} vortex velocities to obtain the {{critical current}}s. The structure factor and displacements of vortices at zero transport current are used to obtain the melting temperature for both pinning arrays. The critical currents are higher for the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>pinning</b> lattice and anisotropic for both pinning arrays. This anisotropy is stronger with temperature for the hexagonal array. For the Kagomé pinning lattice, our analysis shows a multi stage phase melting; that is, as we increase the temperature, each different dynamic phase melts before reaching the melting temperature. Both the melting temperature and critical currents are larger for the hexagonal lattice, indicating the role for the interstitial vortices in decreasing the pinning strength...|$|R
40|$|Next to copper, {{aluminium}} alloys {{are widely used}} in electrical industries, because of their high electrical conductivity. AA 6101 -T 6 and AA 1350 {{aluminium alloys}} are widely used in electrical bus bars. As these alloys are joined by mechanical fasteners in electrical bus bars, the conductive area has been reduced. To avoid this problem, they should be joined without removal of metal {{as well as their}} properties. Friction stir welding technique is mainly invented for joining similar and dissimilar aluminium alloys. In this investigation, friction stir welding of AA 6101 -T 6 and AA 1350 aluminium alloys was done by varying tool traversing speed, rotational speed and tilt angle with <b>hexagonal</b> <b>pin</b> profiled tool. The analysis of variance was employed to study the effect of above parameters on mechanical properties of welded joints. From the experimental results, it is observed that welded joint with the combination of 1070  rpm rotating speed, 78  mm/min traversing speed and 2 ° tilt angle provides better mechanical properties. Analysis of variance shows that most significant impact on tensile strength is made by variation in tool rotating speed while tool tilt angle makes the most significant impact on elongation and bending strength.

Design/methodology/approach: The effect {{of stress in}} machine elements due to friction between working machine parts has {{to be considered for}} analyzing the machine component with ANSYS software package. The interaction between the hole surface and pin was modeled with contact elements. In this study, examination of stress in pin-pin hole connections was carried out by using ANSYS program. Findings: The connection in pin-pin hole plates occurs between surface of pin hole in plate and side surfaces of pin. Stresses in contact surface of selected machine elements were investigated. three different materials such as steel, aluminium and structure steel were analyzed under three different rates of cylindrical plate radius r and length of <b>hexagonal</b> <b>pin</b> 2 h (r/h = 2. 5, 5 and 7. 5).

40|$|Worldwide, {{there is}} limited test reactor {{capacity}} to perform the required irradiation experiments on advanced fast reactor materials and fuel designs. This is particularly true in the U. S., which no longer has an operating fast reactor but depends upon two aging thermal reactors for testing the behavior of various materials in an irradiation environment. The MIT research reactor is planning for a new core to end the need for highly enriched uranium and operate the reactor with uranium enrichments under 20 %. This study explores {{the use of the}} central region in the newly proposed MIT reactor core to boost the production of fast neutrons, thus making the new core more beneficial for materials testing. The Fast Flux Trap introduces a region of fissile material surrounding a central irradiation facility which is cooled by liquid lead-bismuth eutectic. This arrangement maximizes the fast neutron production by avoiding neutron moderation in the center. The fissile material, arranged in a tight <b>hexagonal</b> <b>pin</b> array, can be uranium enriched in either 235 U or 233 U, to the limit allowable for non-proliferation. Insertion of the Fast Flux Trap in the proposed low enriched uranium core operated at a 10 MW power level, can provide a 252 %- 271 % higher fast neutron flux than the previously proposed designs with low enriched fuel for the MIT research reactor and a 235 %- 253 % higher fast neutron flux than the existing highly enriched uranium MITR-II core at 5 MW. (cont.) This new core fast flux capability is within a factor of 2 to 4 of the much larger national test reactors, the Advanced Test Reactor and the High Flux Isotope Reactor, and hence can allow the MIT research reactor to be more useful for fast irradiation. The work covered both steady state and transient events involving the Fast Flux Trap, using the Monte Carlo N-Particle (MCNP) transport code. It was shown that the power distribution within the Fast Flux Trap pins as well as the plates {{in the rest of the}} core will be satisfactory; or in other words, no excessive power peaking will develop. The limits of the Fast Flux Trap lifetime were found to exceed the expected licensing time of the new core. Furthermore, the reactivity implications of metallic coolant leaks, water flooding of the Fast Flux Trap and various possible test materials were all found to be acceptable. The loss of flow following a pump trip event was analyzed using the RELAP 5 - 3 D code, and found not to result in excessive temperatures with regards to materials strength and corrosion resistance. While the specific design developed in this dissertation is particular to the MIT research reactor core, the Fast Flux Trap design concept can potentially be applied in other reactor cores so that other thermal spectrum research and test reactor facilities can benefit from this enhanced capability. by Tyler Shawn Ellis.

40|$|The {{structural}} changes of ultrathin PrO$_ 2 $(111) films grown on Si(111) due to thermal reduction in ultra high vacuum are investigated. Therefore, praseodymia films {{are treated with}} oxygen plasma to obtain completely oxidized PrO$_ 2 $ films. The reduction of these films is studied with thermal desorption spectroscopy combined with ex situ X-ray diffraction measurements. It is shown that the distinct desorption peaks of molecular oxygen are correlated with stabilization of several intermediate phases of praseodymia. The most intense signal of desorbing oxygen is observed at ∼ 650 K. It is coupled to the strongest impact on the crystalline structure since we observe the transition PrO$_ 2 $ → Pr$_ 5 $O$_ 9 $. Further oxygen desorption leads to additional phase transitions with laterally coexisting phases. Grazing incidence X-ray diffraction measurements reveal that the initial pinning to the lateral lattice constant of hexagonal Pr$_ 2 $O$_ 3 $(0001) is not breached due to the plasma treatment. This <b>hexagonal</b> <b>pinning</b> is released during the oxygen desorption so that the crystalline structure of the praseodymia films does not only expand vertically but also laterally...|$|R
40|$|AbstractFriction stir welding {{using the}} tools with {{polygonal}} pins is often found {{to improve the}} mechanical strength of weld joint {{in comparison to the}} tools with circular pins. However, the impacts of pin profile on the peak temperature, tool torque and traverse force, and the resultant mechanical stresses experienced by the tool have been rarely reported in a systematic manner. An estimation of the rate of heat generation for the tools with polygonal pins is challenging due to their non-axisymmetric cross-section about the tool axis. A novel methodology is presented to analytically estimate the rate of heat generation for the tools with polygonal pins. A three-dimensional heat transfer analysis of friction stir welding is carried out using finite element method. The computed temperature field from the heat transfer model is used to estimate the torque, traverse force and the mechanical stresses experienced by regular triangular, square, pentagon and hexagon pins following the principles of solid mechanics. The computed results show that the peak temperature experienced by the tool pin increases with the number of pin sides. However, the resultant maximum shear stress experienced by the pin reduces from the triangular to <b>hexagonal</b> <b>pins...</b>|$|R
40|$|Friction stir welding is a {{solid state}} {{innovative}} joining technique, widely being used for joining aluminium alloys in aerospace, marine automotive and many other applications of commercial importance. The welding parameters and tool pin profile {{play a major role}} in deciding the weld quality. In this paper, an attempt has been made to understand the influences of welding speed and pin profile of the tool on friction stir welded joints of AA 6082 -T 6 alloy. Three different tool pin profiles (tapered cylindrical four flutes, triangular and hexagonal) have been used to fabricate the joints at different welding speeds in the range of 30 to 74 mm/min. Microhardness (HV) and tensile tests performed at room temperature were used to evaluate the mechanical properties of the joints. In order to analyse the microstructural evolution of the material, the weld’s cross-sections were observed optically and SEM observations were made of the fracture surfaces. From this investigation it is found that the <b>hexagonal</b> tool <b>pin</b> profile produces mechanically sound and metallurgically defect free welds compared to other tool pin profiles...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} fulfill the goals set forth by the Generation IV International Forum, the current NERI funded {{research}} has focused on the design of a Gas-cooled Fast Reactor (GFR) operating in a Breed and Burnm (B&B) fuel cycle mode. B&B refers to a once-through fuel cycle where low enriched uranium (less than 5 w/o 235 U in U) subcritical assemblies are loaded into the core in equilibrium, yet in-situ plutonium breeding carries the fuel through a discharge burnup on the order of 150 MWD/kgHM. The B&B fuel cycle meets the GenIV goals of sustainability, economics, and proliferation resistance by increasing fuel burnup without the need for spent fuel reprocessing, recycle, or reuse of any kind. The neutronic requirements for B&B are strict and require an ultra-hard neutron spectrum. Therefore, the GFR is ideally suited for this fuel cycle. In the present work the B&B GFR concept evolved into two practical reactor designs, both of which build on extensive previous gas-cooled reactor design experience. The first version is the "demonstration" concept using highly neutronically reactive U 15 N fuel in a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>pin</b> fuel array that is nearly 50 v/o fuel. The core is helium cooled, with an outlet temperature of 570 °C. The helium primary circuit is coupled to a steam Rankine power conversion system essentially identical to that for the British Advanced Gas-cooled Reactors. One advantage of the low coolant temperature compared to other GenIV GFR concepts is that it allows for the use of oxide dispersion strengthened stainless steels (ODS) in core. The fuel is manufactured using advanced vibration compaction techniques, clad in ODS, and vented in order to achieve the high burnup goal. The second version, the "advanced" concept builds on the experience of the demonstration concept to develop a B&B GFR without the need for expensive U' 5 N fuel. In order to substitute the nitride fuel with carbide, significantly higher heavy metal loadings are required (60 v/o fuel for UC versus 50 v/o fuel for U' 5 N) which are not practically achievable with a conventional pin fuel array. Therefore, an innovative tube-in-duct assembly design was proposed to achieve B&B operation with the less neutronically reactive carbide fuel. The advanced core offers significantly reduced natural uranium requirements and lower equilibrium fuel cycle costs (5 mills/kWhre) compared with conventional light water reactors (7 mills/kWhre), as the burnup is tripled for the same reload enrichment. (cont.) The B&B GFR designs, though requiring active decay heat removal, are semi-self-regulating from a reactivity feedback standpoint and are designed to withstand all plausible accident scenarios, including loss of flow, loss of heat sink, and transient overpower all without scram. Reactor pressure vessel blowdown (LOCA) was investigated and while the B&B GFR has a low positive coolant void reactivity (less than 1 $), the added reactivity during blowdown is compensated through other strong negative reactivity feedback mechanisms, thereby allowing for the safe operation of the B&B GFR. by Peter Yarsky.

40|$|AbstractThe heat treatable aluminum–copper alloy AA 2014 finds wide {{application}} in the aerospace and defence industry {{due to its}} high strength-to-weight ratio and good ductility. Friction stir welding (FSW) process, an emerging solid state joining process, is suitable for joining this alloy compared to fusion welding processes. This work presents the formulation of a mathematical model with process parameters and tool geometry to predict the responses of friction stir welds of AA 2014 -T 6 aluminum alloy, viz yield strength, tensile strength and ductility. The most influential process parameters considered are spindle speed, welding speed, tilt angle and tool pin profile. A four-factor, five-level central composite design was used and a response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to develop the regression models to predict the responses. The mechanical properties, such as yield strength (YS), ultimate tensile strength (UTS) and percentage elongation (%El), are considered as responses.

40|$|AbstractTo {{overcome}} {{the problems of}} fusion welding of aluminium alloys, the friction stir welding (FSW) is recognized as an alternative joining method to improve the mechanical and corrosion properties. Tool profile {{is one of the}} important variables which affect the performance of the FS weld. In the present work, the effect of tool profile on the weld nugget microstructure and pitting corrosion of AA 2219 aluminium–copper alloy was studied. FSW of AA 2219 alloy was carried out using five profiles, namely conical, square, triangle, pentagon and hexagon. The temperature measurements were made in the region adjacent to the rotating pin. It was observed that the peak temperature is more in <b>hexagonal</b> tool <b>pin</b> compared to the welds produced with other tool pin profiles. It is observed that the extensive deformation experienced at the nugget zone and the evolved microstructure strongly influences the hardness and corrosion properties of the joint during FSW. It was found that the microstructure changes like grain size, misorientation and precipitate dissolution during FSW influence the hardness and corrosion behaviour. Pitting corrosion resistance of friction stir welds of AA 2219 was found to be better for hexagon profile tool compared to other profiles, which was attributed to material flow and strengthening precipitate morphology in nugget zone. Higher amount of heat generation in FS welds made with hexagonal profile tool may be the reason for greater dissolution of strengthening precipitates in nugget zone...|$|R
