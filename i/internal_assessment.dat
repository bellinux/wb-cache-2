5|$|The {{nature of}} the <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> (IA) varies by subject. There may be oral presentations (used in languages), {{practical}} work (in experimental sciences and performing arts), or written work. <b>Internal</b> <b>assessment</b> accounts for 20 to 50 percent of the mark awarded for each subject and {{is marked by a}} teacher in the school. A sample of at least five per subject at each level from a school will also be graded by a moderator appointed by the IB, in a process called external moderation of <b>internal</b> <b>assessment.</b> Based on this moderation, the grades of the whole subject from that school will change.|$|E
5|$|Administered by the International Baccalaureate (IB), the IBDP {{is taught}} in schools in over 140 countries, {{in one of three}} languages: English, French, or Spanish. In order to participate, {{students}} must attend an IB school. IBDP students complete assessments in six subjects, one from each subject group, and three core requirements. Students are evaluated using both internal and external assessments, and courses finish with an externally assessed series of examinations, usually consisting of two or three timed written tests. <b>Internal</b> <b>assessment</b> varies by subject: there may be oral presentations, practical work, or written work. In most cases, these are initially graded by the classroom teacher, whose grades are then verified or modified, as necessary, by an appointed external moderator.|$|E

500|$|During an <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> by the National Weather Service, the 10:11 {{bulletin}} and {{its impact}} were analyzed. The report called the bulletin [...] "a significant moment for the NWS during Katrina," [...] as its detailed and explicit language {{did not have any}} precedent, though the message was based on a template designed by the Tampa Weather Office in the 1990s. The strongly worded statement urged residents to evacuate, and was highlighted by national news media. As a result, the level of detail was highlighted as an [...] "innovative best practice" [...] in the NWS assessment, which recommended issuing warnings with similar levels of detail in the future. The bulletin was described as [...] "perhaps the most chilling ever issued" [...] by the NWS.|$|E

The publisher Macmillan conducted an <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> of Blyton's The Mystery That Never Was, submitted to them {{at the height of}} her fame in 1960. The review was carried out by the author and books editor Phyllis Hartnoll, in whose view [...] "There is a faint but unattractive touch of old-fashioned xenophobia in the author's attitude to the thieves; they are 'foreign'... and this seems to be regarded as sufficient to explain their criminality." [...] Macmillan rejected the manuscript, but it was published by William Collins in 1961, and then again in 1965 and 1983.|$|E
2500|$|Individual Assessment In {{order to}} reduce social loafing, a company can always focus on {{assessing}} each members contribution rather than only examining the teams accomplishments as a whole. It is statistically proven that social loafers will tend to put in less effort {{because of the lack}} of external or <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> of their contributions. This leads to less self-awareness in the group because the team together is the only body evaluated. (Curt. 2007) ...|$|E

2500|$|After the war, the Indian {{government}} severed {{ties with}} Pakistan and increased defence preparedness. India increased its defence budget as {{it sought to}} acquire more {{state of the art}} equipment. Media reported about military procurement irregularities and criticism of intelligence agencies like Research and Analysis Wing, which failed to predict the intrusions or the identity/number of infiltrators during the war. An <b>internal</b> <b>assessment</b> report by the armed forces, published in an Indian magazine, showed several other failings, including [...] "a sense of complacency" [...] and being [...] "unprepared for a conventional war" [...] on the presumption that nuclearism would sustain peace. It also highlighted the lapses in command and control, the insufficient troop levels and the dearth of large-calibre guns like the Bofors. In 2006, retired Air Chief Marshal, A.Y. Tipnis, alleged that the Indian Army did not fully inform the government about the intrusions, adding that the army chief Ved Prakash Malik, was initially reluctant to use the full strike capability of the Indian Air Force, instead requesting only helicopter gunship support. Soon after the conflict, India also decided to complete the project, previously stalled by Pakistan, to fence the entire LOC.|$|E
