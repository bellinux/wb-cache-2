40|$|A shallow-dipping ductile mylonitic {{shear zone}} and {{concordant}} brittle detachment fault (Mai'iu fault) together {{make up the}} dominant geological structure that controls the orientation of dip slopes on the flanks of Mount Dayman, eastern Papuan Peninsula, Papua New Guinea. The dip slopes dip in all directions from the peak of Mount Dayman and form a domed landform that is much less dissected by streams compared to the adjacent Mount Suckling domed landform. The orientation of megacorrugations on the domed surface of Mount Dayman (footwall) is consistent with NNE-directed transport of the hangingwall block, which is composed of low-grade undifferentiated volcanic and sedimentary rocks and minor ultramafic rocks. Though previously documented as a thrust surface, the geometry and style of structures and map relations presented in this study indicate an extensional origin for the domed mylonitic foliation (S 1) and mineral elongation lineation (L 1). The field relationships {{are consistent with the}} domed landform comprising the core of a metamorphic core complex. Observations of dominantly NNE-trending regional lineaments in aerial photography and Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) data correlate with detailed field analysis of mineral elongation lineations (L 1) in the main metamorphic core complex. bounding shear zone. Field relationships show a crosscutting sequence of structures that includes: (1) ductile S 2 folia with ESE-plunging blue sodic-calcic amphibole mineral elongation lineations; (2) narrow, steeply dipping ductile D 2 shear zones; and (3) semibrittle to brittle fault zones. S-C' fabrics, asymmetric strain shadows around porphyroclasts, and fault drag indicate a top-down-to-the-NNE sense of shear for most structures. Kinematic vorticity analysis of the highest-grade ductile deformation indicates a kinematic vorticity number (Wk) between 0. 34 and 0. 56, suggesting general shear for the early stage of deformation (D 1). The NNE-directed lineaments and L 1 mineral elongation lineations are consistent with the Australia-Woodlark <b>Eulerian</b> <b>pole</b> for periods between the early Pliocene (3. 6 Ma) and Pleistocene (0. 52 Ma). This observation is consistent with ca. 3. 3 Ma granite and monzonite intrusions that cut the mylonitic fabrics and limit the age of the mylonitic fabrics to older than 3. 3 Ma on Mount Suckling. A SE-dipping sedimentary sequence (Gwoira Conglomerate) characterizes part of the hanging wall of the metamorphic core complex. Petrography of the clasts within the sedimentary rocks indicates that metabasite rocks were the dominant source. The unit is in fault contact with the metabasite footwall across prehnite-bearing D 3 brittle fault zones. 17 page(s...|$|E
40|$|The Central European Geodynamics Project CERGOP- 2, {{funded by}} the European Union from 2003 to 2006 under the 5 th Framework Programme, benefited from {{repeated}} measurements of the coordinates of epoch and permanent GPS stations of the Central European GPS Reference Network (CEGRN), starting in 1994. Here {{we report on the}} results of the systematic processing of available data up to 2005. The analysis has yielded velocities for some 60 sites, covering a variety of Central European tectonic provinces, from the Adria Indenter to the Tauern Window, the Dinarides, the Pannonian Basin, the Vrancea Seismic Zone and the Carpathian Mountains. The estimated velocities define kinematical patterns which outline, with varying spatial resolution depending on the station density and history, the present-day surface kinematics in Central Europe. Horizontal velocities are analyzed after removal from the ITRF 2000 estimated velocities of a rigid rotation accounting for the mean motion of Europe: a ∼ 2. 3 mm/year north–south oriented convergence rate between Adria and the Southern Alps that can be considered to be the present-day velocity of the Adria Indenter relative to the European Foreland. An eastward extrusion zone initiates at the Tauern Window. The lateral eastward flow towards the Pannonian Basin exhibits a gentle gradient from 1 to 1. 5 mm/year immediately east of the Tauern Window to zero in the Pannonian Basin. This kinematic continuity implies that the Pannonian plate fragment recently suggested by seismic data does not require a specific <b>Eulerian</b> <b>pole.</b> On the southeastern boundary of the Adria microplate, we report a velocity drop from 4 to 4. 5 mm/year motion near Matera to ∼ 1 mm/year north of the Dinarides, in the southwestern part of the Pannonian Basin. A positive velocity gradient as one moves south from West Ukraine across Rumania and Bulgaria is estimated to be 2 mm/year on a scale of 600 – 800 km, as if the crust were dragged by the counterclockwise rotation along the North Anatolian Fault Zone. This regime apparently does not interfere with the Vrancea Seismic Zone: earthquakes there are sufficiently deep (> 100 km) that the brittle deformation at depth can be considered as decoupled from the creep at the surface. We conclude that models of the Quaternary tectonics of Central and Eastern Europe should not neglect the long wavelength, nearly aseismic deformation affecting the upper crust in the Romanian and Bulgarian regions...|$|E
40|$|Structures {{associated}} with dextral transpression on Finlay-Ingenika fault (FIF) in the McConnell Creek area, north-central British Columbia, {{are dominated by}} subvertical to vertical strike-slip faults, as indicated {{by a variety of}} kinematic indicators. Position-gradient tensors determined from strain analysis of deformed volcanic fragments in a succession of Late Triassic Takla Group rocks abutting one of the north-northwest trending faults indicate that they are dextrally transpressive, in accord with the common occurrence of subvertical intersections of the fault planes with other planar fabrics and subhorizontal stretching lineations within the fault zones. Principal directions of the magnetic susceptibility ellipsoids from Early Jurassic to Cretaceous dioritic rocks are consistent with those of the strain ellipsoids in their adjacent volcanics, suggesting that the plutonic rocks experienced the same deformation as the Late Triassic Takla Group volcanics. The age of the strike-slip faulting is unknown but was probably not earlier than mid Cretaceous as the Early Jurassic to Cretaceous dioritic rocks were involved in the faulting in many places. Some of the major faults cut the area into discrete, fault-bounded blocks several kilometres wide. As the dextral motion on the FIF progressed, deformation was concentrated within the previously formed fault zones while the fault-bounded rocks remained weakly deformed. Stress tensors for 24 sites were inverted from the regional cleavage within the blocks, which predates the block-bounding faults. The site-mean stress tensors indicate that the fault-bounded blocks were rotated clockwise about a subvertical axis during progressive dextral motion on the FIF. The amount of rotation varies systematically over the area with maximum value (58. 7 $ pm$ 3. 3 $ sp circ$) close to the FIF and minimum value (0. 0 $ pm$ 1. 6 $ sp circ$) about 20 kilometres away from it. Paleomagnetic samples were collected from 13 sites in the widespread Early Jurassic to Cretaceous plutonic rocks. Interpretable magnetic components of the Late Cretaceous, isolated by both stepwise AF and thermal demagnetization from 6 sites, were used to calculate the paleopole. The observed paleopole has a low value of Fisher's precision k = 48, and is significantly different from the Late Cretaceous reference pole for cratonal North America (CNA). After corrections for the local block rotations, the observed paleopole has a high value of k = 383 and moves closer to the reference pole but is still significantly different from it. Rotation about the <b>Eulerian</b> <b>pole</b> for the best-fitting small circle to the Tintina trench and northern Rocky Mountain trench fault zone, however, brings the observed pole into coincidence with that for CNA, and requires only $ sim$ 670 kilometres of dextral displacement on the fault zone. It is likely, therefore, that local structures {{associated with}} dextral strike-slip faults in the western Canadian Cordillera may account for {{at least part of the}} paleomagnetic disparity between some western parts of the Canadian Cordillera and CNA...|$|E
40|$|The most {{reliable}} and significant seismological and geodetic {{constraints on the}} kinematics of the Adriatic Plate are tentatively recognized and used for determining Adriatic-Eurasia <b>Eulerian</b> <b>poles.</b> The poles so obtained, {{in spite of the}} considerable uncertainty that might affect them, significantly differ from the ones of previous studies. Possible explanations of this discrepancy are discussed. It is then argued that the distribution of Quaternary deformation and seismotectonic activity in the Adriatic and surrounding regions suggests that no appreciable relative motion can be recognized between the Adriatic and Africa. This evidence implies that the kinematics of the Adriatic may provide a constraint on the motion of Africa in the central Mediterranean region...|$|R
40|$|The {{definition}} {{and maintenance of}} a geodetic reference system by modern techniques requires systematic temporal changes {{of the position of}} the defining stations to be taken into account. Most of these drifts are accommodated by present day plate tectonics. If the lithospheric plate to which a given station belongs were perfectly rigid, then a simple plate model based upon rigid rotations about <b>Eulerian</b> <b>poles</b> would suffice to predict the horizontal coordinates of each station at any epoch, once the coordinates of that station are known at a reference epoch. In Europe, there are stations well located inside old, stable areas which may be considered rigid, but other stations are at or near continental margins undergoing active deformation, or are within a relatively recent portion of a tectonic unit subject to intraplate stress or volcanism. Velocities of stations in the most recent ITRF solutions do, in fact, exhibit in some cases departures from the NUVEL 1 A NNR plate model in Europe and elsewhere, but the reasons for these discrepancies are not always well understood. For example, if a particular station of the network exhibits a velocity anomaly relative to a reference velocity model, then it is of interest to understand the reasons for the anomaly, and its spatial extent, that is if it is local to that station, or if nearby stations ar...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of geodetic observations {{carried out by}} 478 continuous GPS stations in the Italian region since 2001 has allowed a fairly good definition of the ongoing horizontal velocity field with respect to Eurasia. It is argued that such evidence can provide important insights into the geodynamic context in the central Mediterranean area. Numerous velocity vectors in the Apulia zone coherently indicate that the southern Adriatic domain is moving roughly NE ward. Since no significant decoupling zone between this domain and Nubia {{has so far been}} recognized, one could expect that the kinematics of these two plates is compatible. However, this condition is not fulfilled if the Nubia-Eurasia relative motion is taken from the global kinematic models, either deduced by long-term evidence [1] or short-term geodetic data [2] [3]. This problem is considerably reduced if the alternative Nubia-Eurasia rotation pole suggested by [4] is taken into account. This choice is also suggested by other major long-term evidence in the Mediterranean region. The numerous geodetic vectors available in two Adriatic sectors, the Apulia zone and the Venetian plain, would imply an Adria-Eurasia rotation pole incompatible with all Nubia-Eurasia <b>Eulerian</b> <b>poles</b> so far proposed. Since a significant relative motion between these plates is not compatible with the absence of a tectonic decoupling zone, we suppose that the short-term kinematics of Adria might be influenced by a transient non-rigid behaviour of that plate. This hypothesis is compatible with the expected effects (post seismic relaxation) of the major decoupling earthquakes that have occurred along Periadriatic zones in the past tens of years. The compatibility of the GPS kinematic pattern in the Apennine belt, Calabria Arc and Sicily with the implications of the geodynamic/tectonic interpretations so far proposed for the central Mediterranean area is then discussed...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{discussion}} of the short-wavelength (25 - 100 km) undulations of the geoid recovered from Seasat altimeter data in the South Atlantic. These undulations are known to be highly correlated to seafloor topography, and they considerably improve our knowledge about global bathymetry of the South Atlantic, which remains poorly surveyed. The orientation of fracture zones (FZ) with respect to the Seasat profiles ensures an efficient recovery of the FZ pattern in the youngJr (< 65 Ma) parts of the South Atlantic between 20 øN and 50 øS. We used 22 well-marked FZs regularly distributed between 12 øN and 47 øS to compute <b>Eulerian</b> <b>poles</b> describing the finite relative movement between Africa and South America. From the present back to 35 Ma, FZ trends south of the equator are well accounted for with a single rotation, and standard statistical tests do not indicate a need for distinct and successive rotations. However, these tests indicate an improvement of the fit when distinct poles are adjusted to separate subsets of our 22 FZs (either FZs north and south of the equator, or FZs north and south of Tristan da Cunha). This points out the possibility of the existence of either "corridors " in which slight relative movements occur, or diffuse elastic deformation over the entire South Atlantic, although this is really a second-order effect. We also present and discuss a map of the roughness of the geoid (for the 25 - to 110 -km wave band). Strong disagreements between the roughness map and the GEBCO maps exist in regions of sparse ship track coverage; for example, the Rio Grande Rise has an associated roughness feature which appears elongated and more symmetric with respect to the Walvis Ridge than what is displayed on the GEBCO maps. The roughness map also clearly documents a long-wavelength (• 400 km) segmentation of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between the equator and 35 øS. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} main tectonic {{features}} of the Eastern Mediterranean region combining the recent information obtained from GPS measurements, seismicity and neotectonic studies. GPS measurements reveal that the Arabian plate moves northward with respect to Eurasia {{at a rate of}} 23 ± 1 mm/yr, 10 mm/yr of this rate is taken up by shortening in the Caucasus. The internal deformation in Eastern Anatolia by conjugate strike-slip faulting and E-W trending thrusts, including the Bitlis frontal thrust, accommodates approximately a 15 mm/yr slip rate. The Northeast Anatolian fault, which extends from the Erzincan basin to Caucasus accommodates about 8 ± 5 mm/yr of left-lateral motion. The neotectonic fault pattern in Eastern Anatolia suggests that the NE Anatolian block moves in an E-ENE direction towards the South Caspian Sea. According to the same data, the Anatolian-Aegean block is undergoing a counter-clockwise rotation. However, from the residuals it appears that this solution can only be taken as a preliminary approximation. The <b>Eulerian</b> rotation <b>pole</b> indicates that slip rate along the North Anatolian fault is about 26 ± 3 mm/yr. This value is 10 mm/yr higher than slip rates obtained from geological data and historical earthquake records and it includes westward drift of the Pontides of a few millimetres/year or more. GPS measurements reveal that the East Anatolian fault accommodates an 11 ± 1 mm/yr relative motion. GPS data suggest that Central Anatolia behaves as a rigid block, but from neotectonic studies, it clearly appears that it is sliced by a number of conjugate strike-slip faults. The Isparta Angle area might be considered a major obstacle for the westward motion of the Anatolian block (Central and Eastern Anatolia). The western flank of this geological structure, the Fethiye-Burdur fault zone appears to be a major boundary with a slip rate of 15 - 20 mm/yr. The Western Anatolian grabens take up a total of 15 mm/yr NE-SW extension. The fact that motions in Central Anatolia relative to Eurasia, are 15 - 20 mm/yr while in Western Anatolia and Aegean Sea they are 30 - 40 mm/yr could suggest that Western Anatolia decouples from Central Anatolia and the Isparta Angle by the Fethiye-Burdur fault zone and Eski?ehir fault. It is also hypothesized that the differentiation of tectonic styles and velocities in the Anatolian-Aegean block are related to differences between the slabs lying under the Cyprus and Hellenic arcs...|$|R
