5|$|That wasn't just a {{faith in}} {{herself and her}} talent, but also the ability to let herself go, to pray to God, and to trust in what would happen. These were, by far, her most inspiring words to date, letting others know {{that no matter what}} they were doing, no matter how <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> were, with help they would win through. Musically, the piece had a {{restrained}} dance beat, very Mowtownish, that owed a little more to gospel, with a chorus - sung by Mariah, Trey and Patrique - that rose gloriously from the verse to repeat and drive and its very positive message home.|$|E
5|$|For the {{technical}} crew members, the film's human characters posed a difficult set of challenges. Bird's story {{was filled with}} elements that were difficult to animate with CGI back then. Humans are widely {{considered to be the}} most <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> to execute in animation. Pixar's animators filmed themselves walking to better grasp proper human motion. Creating an all-human cast required creating new technology to animate detailed human anatomy, clothing, and realistic skin and hair. Although {{the technical}} team had some experience with hair and cloth in Monsters, Inc. (2001), the amount of hair and cloth required for The Incredibles had never been done by Pixar until this point. Moreover, Bird would tolerate no compromises for the sake of technical simplicity. Where the technical team on Monsters, Inc. had persuaded director Pete Docter to accept pigtails on Boo to make her hair easier to animate, the character of Violet had to have long hair that obscured her face; it was integral to her character. Violet's long hair, which was extremely difficult to animate, was only successfully animated toward the end of production. In addition, animators had to adapt to having hair underwater and blowing through the wind. Disney was initially reluctant to make the film because of these issues, feeling a live-action film would be preferable, though Lasseter vetoed this.|$|E
500|$|Crew members often {{complained about}} {{difficult}} shoots, with many quitting or being fired. Mary Parent was then brought in as a producer. Iñárritu stated {{that some of}} the crew members had left the film, explaining that [...] "as a director, if I identify a violin that is out of tune, I have to take that from the orchestra." [...] On his experience filming, DiCaprio stated: [...] "I can name 30 or 40 sequences that were some of the most <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> I’ve ever had to do. Whether it’s {{going in and out of}} frozen rivers, or sleeping in animal carcasses, or what I ate on set. [...] enduring freezing cold and possible hypothermia constantly." ...|$|E

500|$|After {{her second}} album, Jackson {{terminated}} business affairs with her family, commenting [...] "I {{just wanted to}} get out of the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> that I had to do." [...] Attempting a third album, Jackson teamed with producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. They set out to achieve crossover pop appeal, while also creating a strong foundation within the urban market. Within six weeks, Jackson and the duo crafted her third studio album, Control, released in February 1986. The album peaked at number one on the Billboard 200, and was certified fivefold platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), selling over ten million copies worldwide.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack to Departures was by Joe Hisaishi, a {{composer}} who had gained international recognition {{for his work}} with Hayao Miyazaki and Studio Ghibli. Before shooting began, Takita asked him to prepare a soundtrack which would represent the separation between Daigo and his father, {{as well as the}} mortician's love for his wife. Owing to the importance of cellos and cello music in the narrative, Hisaishi emphasized the instrument in his soundtrack; he described the challenge of centring a score around the cello {{as one of the most}} <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> he had ever done. This score was played during shooting, which according to Takita [...] "allowed [...] to visualize many of the emotions in the film" [...] and thus contributed to the quality of the finished work.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{marks the}} debut {{appearance}} of Lurleen on The Simpsons. She {{was created by}} one of the show's character designers, John Rice. Kirkland thought the first design Rice drew of Lurleen was too [...] "bland" [...] and [...] "plain", so they decided to model her after D'Angelo and add [...] "every kind of pretty girl cliché" [...] into the design. Rice and Kirkland then sent the character to Groening, who sent back a note saying [...] "wow". Reiss's show runner partner Al Jean said that [...] "one of the most <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> when translating real people to a Simpsons look is for women to look beautiful", as the Simpson overbite and facial construction make it particularly difficult to design women's looks. Lurleen's last name, Lumpkin, came from the country bumpkin character Tony Lumpkin in the 1773 comedy play She Stoops to Conquer by Oliver Goldsmith.|$|E

500|$|The title California is {{representative}} of the band's home state, and was picked after the band members realized that they had written multiple songs relating to its cities and culture. The title was also inspired by the season and Feldmann's studio: [...] "It was a perfect California winter, and it was sunny and hot every single day. John's studio, it's basically indoor-outdoor with palm trees everywhere." [...] Though he refrained from dubbing it a concept album, Skiba considered the songs linked thematically: [...] "big and bright and huge and dark and twisted, everything that California is." [...] "The title of this album {{was one of the most}} <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> I've done in my entire life," [...] said Hoppus. Alternate titles for the album included No Future, which was dropped because it seemed too negative, and the joke titles OB-GYN Kenobi, Nude Erection, and No Hard Feelings. D*Face also reported that the titles Los Angeles and Riot were nearly used.|$|E
500|$|Jackson {{subsequently}} fired {{her father}} as her manager and hired John McClain, then A Records' {{senior vice president}} of artists and repertoire and general manager. She also subsequently left the Jackson home in Encino, California and moved into her own apartment around this time. Commenting on the decision, she stated, [...] "I just {{wanted to get out of}} the house, get out from under my father, which was one of the most <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> that I had to do, telling him that I didn't want to work with him again." [...] Joseph Jackson resented John McClain for what he saw as an underhanded attempt to steal his daughter's career out from under him. McClain responded by saying [...] "I'm not trying to pimp Janet Jackson or steal her away from her father." [...] He subsequently introduced her to the songwriting and production duo James [...] "Jimmy Jam" [...] Harris III and Terry Lewis, former Prince associates and ex-members of The Time.|$|E
500|$|Slant writer Ed Gonzalez {{gave the}} film a two- out of four-star rating, saying the characters' actions {{do not feel}} [...] "appropriately warped" [...] while the {{interactions}} between the teachers and students is not [...] "at all rife with the what-are-they-thinking-about-us mystery of the book". Andrew O'Hehir of Salon.com wrote that Romanek [...] "does so many <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> beautifully in this movie". He thought the film carried a reminder that life is short regardless of how long it lasts rather than a [...] "lecture about the horrors of human history". Tom Preston from The Guardian described Mulligan and Garfield's acting as solid, while commenting that Knightley's emotional performances are occasionally jarring. He further wrote that although Never Let Me Go finely demonstrated subtlety, its screenplay could have been written with less compression in some parts. Writing in Newsweek, Louisa Thomas praised the film for its beauty and its performances but declared that [...] "there's something just missing here." ...|$|E

500|$|Leroux {{stated that}} {{at a very early}} age, she knew she wanted to play for the United States women's {{national}} soccer team. To pursue her goal, she moved to Scottsdale, Arizona at the age of 15 and attended Horizon High School during her junior and senior years while living with multiple host families. Despite having a challenging time adjusting to life without her family and friends, she helped lead Sereno Soccer Club to state titles in 2007 and 2008. Of her move to the United States, she said, [...] "It was not easy. It {{was probably one of the}} most <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> I ever had to do, move away from everything that I knew and was comfortable with to something that I had no idea about. Not having any family around. Doing it on my own. As a 15-year-old, that's kind of hard. I had to grow up really fast [...] But I guess it's all worth it. Now I have a chance to prove myself, and that's what I enjoy, and that's why I did what I did." ...|$|E
500|$|Steph {{initially}} reacted angrily {{towards her}} diagnosis, which Pinder confirmed was not uncommon, explaining: [...] "The character {{is going through}} stages that someone with epilepsy is likely to go through. Teenagers can have terrible trouble {{coming to terms with}} epilepsy {{at a time when they}} have a lot of other <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> to deal with. It can also be quite a blow to their independence." [...] Writing for the Sunday Mail, Steve Hendry assessed that the plot would serve to [...] "bring the arrogant and often spiteful Steph down a peg or two", humbling her. Stenson agreed that Steph's epilepsy would make her [...] "more understanding", inspiring thoughtfulness towards others, as opposed to her former rejection of those different to her. However, she observed that the condition may also serve to worsen her behaviour towards [...] "a chosen few." [...] The character's epilepsy was further explored in the Hollyoaks spin-off , in which Steph has a seizure and believes she is possessed by a spirit, almost causing her to drown.|$|E
500|$|Asked {{how does}} he think that the album has aged, Dave Mustaine responded: [...] "I think it's timely and {{timeless}} at the same time, and I think that's {{one of the most}} <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> for a musician to do. Very few records in our genre are like that. Musically it's heavy and the lyrics are very symbolic." [...] In the liner notes of the album's 20th anniversary edition, music journalist Kory Grow wrote that [...] "thanks to a perfect balance of hard-rock song structures, epic choruses, and fleet-fingered guitar work, Countdown to Extinction became an instant classic, benefiting from copious MTV and radio play." [...] Artistdirect editor in chief Rick Florino called the album a [...] "seminal" [...] release and commented that it [...] "changed the game by preserving the band's thrash intensity and impressive technical prowess, while dropping some of the biggest hooks the genre had ever seen". In a retrospective review of the album, Craig Hayes from Popmatters wrote that Countdown to Extinctions [...] "status as a gateway metal album is indisputable" [...] and its [...] "popularity speaks volumes about its significance in the metal canon".|$|E

[...] Joseph Jackson resented John McClain for what he saw as an underhanded attempt to steal his daughter's career out from under him, stating, [...] "I've worked hard for my family. The problem comes, though, when others come in behind you and try to steal them away. The wheels have already been set for Janet Jackson. Anyone who jumps on now will be getting a free ride."

500|$|The song, {{which was}} the last one written for the album, was placed {{at the end of the}} album because it [...] "marks a new beginning" [...] for the band, {{which was the}} theme on the album and a theme in Lee's life. In the booklet of The Open Door, she stated that her long-time friend and husband, Josh Hartzler, was the main {{inspiration}} for the song. In the booklet she wrote, [...] "Josh, you are my muse. Nothing inspires me the way you do. Thank you for all my missing pieces. Thank you for your strength and love. Thank you for letting me see myself through your eyes, because only then could I know that I am good enough for you." [...] One of the band's previous singles, [...] "Bring Me to Life", was also written about Josh Hartzler. In an interview with VH1, Lee further revealed the inspiration behind the song, saying [...] "I had gone through a lot of <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> during the writing of the whole album, and by the end of it, I had stepped away from those bad situations. That's really hard. You have to be really brave and strong about it. After doing that, I felt so amazing. For the first time I felt like I could write a song based on how good I felt. I have never done that before ever. During another interview with The Washington Post she stated: ...|$|E
2500|$|The spiritual teacher Meher Baba {{held that}} humility {{is one of}} the {{foundations}} of devotional life: [...] "Upon the altar of humility we must offer our prayers to God." [...] Baba also described the power of humility to overcome hostility: [...] "True humility is strength, not weakness. It disarms antagonism and ultimately conquers it." [...] Finally, Baba emphasized the importance of being humble when serving others: [...] "One of the most <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> to learn is to render service without bossing, without making a fuss about it and without any consciousness of high and low. In the world of spirituality, humility counts {{at least as much as}} utility." ...|$|E

2500|$|Dirac {{was known}} among his colleagues for his precise and taciturn nature. His colleagues in Cambridge jokingly defined a unit called a [...] "dirac", {{which was one}} word per hour. When Niels Bohr complained {{that he did not}} know how to finish a {{sentence}} in a scientific article he was writing, Dirac replied, [...] "I was taught at school never to start a sentence without knowing the end of it." [...] He criticised the physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer's interest in poetry: [...] "The aim of science is to make <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> understandable in a simpler way; the aim of poetry is to state simple things in an incomprehensible way. The two are incompatible." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ed Ney at Minnesota had {{a strong}} belief that being at the {{scientific}} forefront meant doing new and <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> that few others were doing and doing them better. [...] He also felt {{that to be the}} best at what you do and the master of your future, you {{had to be able to}} learn how to create and advance all of the technology in your own house rather than collaborating too closely with outsiders. [...] Ed's eclectic interests led him in a natural progression from the Manhattan Project, to measurements of cosmic rays, to studies of the physics of balloon flight, to atmospheric and solar physics, to research on the solar corona and the zodiacal light, and finally into the world of astronomy.|$|E
2500|$|He also poses a {{question}} to the interviewees related to the film's title, and asks [...] "Sometimes normal people are scary to kids with autism. They talk funny or too fast.

They do" [...] and [...] "A little, yes". Cross poses the question to those with autism: [...] "What is normal anyway?". Cross interviews autistic students in the film and asks them to cite the most <b>difficult</b> <b>things</b> about their condition.
