5|$|At {{the start}} of 1974, the LCL had {{undertaken}} some progressive reforms. They brought in a less conservative membership at the grassroots level, although the old guard was still prominent in parliamentary roles. They tried to broach the possibility of reintegrating the LM. Wilson and the new {{executive director of the}} LCL, John Vial were at the forefront, but the LM was optimistic about its future and refused unless the LCL changed leaders and allowed for explicitly separate urban and rural factions, which <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E

There were rumours that Baird would leave provincial politics to contest the 2004 election, but this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen.</b> In 2005 he resigned his provincial seat to campaign federally for the Conservative Party.|$|E

Two violent purges were carried out among the partisans of his predecessors to strengthen Béla's rule. King Coloman's alleged son Boris tried to dethrone Béla but the king and his allies defeated the pretender's troops in 1132. In the second half of Béla's reign, Hungary adopted an active foreign policy. Bosnia and Split seem to have accepted Béla's suzerainty around 1136.|$|E
5|$|Poedjangga Baroe {{was closed}} {{with the fall}} of the Dutch East Indies {{government}} after the Japanese invaded the Indies in February 1942; the last issue published covered the period of December 1941 to February 1942. The editors wrote in that issue that they intended to continue publication as long as feasible; this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen,</b> although later writers used a similar style. Until its closing, the original run of Poedjangga Baroe published about ninety issues.|$|E

On November 25, 1981, Laura Bush gave birth to fraternal twin daughters, Barbara and Jenna. The twins were born five weeks early by an emergency Caesarean section, as Laura had developed life-threatening pre-eclampsia (toxemia). The twins {{graduated from high school}} in 2000 and attended Yale University and the University of Texas at Austin, respectively, in 2004.

After 1992 the building stood topped out, but without any windows or interior fittings. In 2008 construction resumed, and the exterior was completed in 2011. It was planned to open the hotel in 2012, the centenary of Kim Il-sung's birth, but this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen.</b> A partial opening was announced for 2013, but this was also cancelled. , the building remains unopened and has been called the tallest unfinished building in the world.|$|E
5|$|However, British Waterways {{decided that}} their full {{restoration}} {{was an important}} aim in 2002, {{and the construction of}} the main stadium for the 2012 Summer Olympics on an island formed by the rivers provided funding to construct a new lock and sluices which stabilised water levels throughout the Olympic site. It was hoped that significant amounts of materials for the construction of the Olympic facilities would be delivered by barge, but this <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen.</b> Improvements to the channels which form a central feature of the Olympic Park included the largest aquatic planting scheme ever carried out in Britain.|$|E
5|$|In March 2010, it was {{announced}} that Eurotunnel was in discussions with the Intergovernment Commission, which oversees the tunnel, with the aim of amending elements of the safety code governing the tunnel's usage. Most saliently, the requirement that trains be able to split within the tunnel and each part of the train be driven out to opposite ends has been removed. However, the proposal to allow shorter trains was not passed. Eurotunnel Chairman & Chief Executive Jacques Gounon said that he hoped the liberalisation of rules would allow entry into the market of competitors such as Deutsche Bahn. Sources at Eurotunnel suggested that Deutsche Bahn could have entered the market at the timetable change in December 2012. This, however, <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen.</b>|$|E

5|$|In late 1990 after Iraqi forces under Saddam Hussein invaded and {{occupied}} Kuwait, ultimately {{leading to the}} Gulf War, American commentators and Middle East experts {{expressed concern about the}} possible consequences of the Arab street in the region rising up in support of Saddam against their own governments, many of whom (particularly Egypt) had joined the military coalition led by the United States. This <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen</b> when the actual war began, nor for the hundred days of combat before Iraqi forces retreated and surrendered. A year later, in 1992, David Pollock of the United States Information Agency (USIA) wrote a lengthy paper arguing that those commentators had seriously misunderstood the Arab street and, by extension, all Arab public opinion.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, the United States Drug Enforcement Administration noted {{the drug was}} being used recreationally in California.

Not long after, {{there was an explosion}} in the drug's use worldwide – a situation which was soon followed by legislative control in many countries. Since 1999, benzylpiperazine use grew sharply in New Zealand due to an initial complete lack of regulation. The New Zealand government attempted to ban the product as of 18 December 2007, but the necessary second reading of the bill <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen</b> in time for the law to be passed. It was so widely used that an estimated 5 million pills were sold in New Zealand in 2007.|$|E
5|$|The Ninth Five-Year Plan {{delivered}} a change: {{for the first}} time industrial consumer products out-produced industrial capital goods. Consumer goods such as watches, furniture and radios were produced in abundance. The plan still left the bulk of the state's investment in industrial capital-goods production. This outcome was not seen as a positive sign {{for the future of the}} Soviet state by the majority of top party functionaries within the government; by 1975 consumer goods were expanding 9% slower than industrial capital-goods. The policy continued despite Brezhnev's commitment to make a rapid shift of investment to satisfy Soviet consumers and lead to an even higher standard of living.

A new South stand was built in 2005 and 2006 to make the stadium into a complete bowl. The first match to be played at the redeveloped Twickenham was on Sunday 5 November 2006 against the All Blacks. England lost the match 41-20 in front of a record crowd of 82,076.|$|E
5|$|Vaulx Carter (August 14, 1863 – before 1930) was an American college {{football}} player and engineer who is best {{remembered as the}} first coach of the Navy Midshipmen football program. He was born in Tennessee and raised there for part of his childhood, until he was orphaned and adopted by family members in Pennsylvania. Starting in 1880, Carter attended the United States Naval Academy; he struggled academically at the school, only excelling in his art classes. Carter failed his final examinations in his final two years at the academy and was recommended for removal following the second failure. This <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>happen,</b> as {{he was forced to}} voluntarily resign from the school in 1883 due to permanent injuries received from an accident.|$|E
