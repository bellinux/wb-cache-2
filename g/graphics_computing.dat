40|$|Abstract. General Purpose <b>Graphics</b> <b>Computing</b> Units can be effec-tively {{used for}} {{enhancing}} {{the performance of}} many contemporary scien-ti c applications. However, programming GPUs using machine-specic notations like CUDA or OpenCL can be complex and time consuming. In addition, the resulting programs are typically ne-tuned for a partic-ular target device. A promising alternative is to program in a conven-tional and machine-independent notation extended with directives and use compilers to generate GPU code automatically. These compilers en-able portability and increase programmer productivity and, if effective, would not impose much penalty on performance. This paper evaluates two such compilers, PGI and Cray. We rst iden-tify a collection of standard transformations that these compilers can apply. Then, we propose a sequence of manual transformations that pro-grammers can apply to enable the generation of efficient GPU kernels. Lastly, using the Rodinia Benchmark suite, we compare {{the performance of the}} code generated by the PGI and Cray compilers with that of code written in CUDA. Our evaluation shows that the code produced by the PGI and Cray compilers can perform well. For 6 of the 15 benchmarks that we evaluated, the compiler generated code achieved over 85 % of the performance of a hand-tuned CUDA version...|$|E
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{inspired}} by Neuroinformatics, which is a new national and international activity. Neuroinformatics is a growing field defined in {{a report from the}} OECD MegaScience Forum. Neuroinformatics is interdisciplinary, combining research in neuroscience and informatics (including computation) with the aim to develop and apply advanced tools and approaches needed for understanding the brain. In the study of the competence and flexibility of the brain, neuroinformatics research is uniquely placed at the intersection of medical, biological, and behavioural science, the physical sciences, computer science, mathematics and engineering. The resultant synergy from combining these approaches is expected to accelerate scientific and technological progress, resulting in major medical, social, and economic benefits. I discuss neuroinformatics in view of information infrastructure research, with open, enabling, shared, heterogeneous and socio-technical properties. Realization of a neuroinformatical information infrastructure involves fundamental changes in neurocientific research practice. There will be a need for standardized ways to structure and annotate data and tools. In addition quality criteria are needed to facilitate sharing across neuroscientific communities.

40|$|Abstract—The high {{dimensionality}} of hyperspectral imagery challenges {{image processing}} and analysis. Band selection {{is a common}} technique for dimensionality reduction. When the desired object information is unknown, an unsupervised band selection approach is employed to select the most distinctive and informative bands. Although band selection can significantly alle-viate the computational burden in the following data processing and analysis, the process itself may induce additional computation complexity, especially when the image spatial size is large; it may be time-consuming for unsupervised band selection methods that need to take all pixels into consideration. Parallel computing tech-niques are widely adopted to alleviate the computational burden and to achieve real-time processing of data with vast volume. In this paper, we propose parallel implementations via emerging gen-eral-purpose graphics processing units (GPUs) for band selection without changing band selection result. Its speedup performance {{is comparable to the}} cluster-based parallel implementation. We also propose an approach to using several selected pixels for unsupervised band selection and the number of pixels needed can be equal to the number of selected bands minus one. With whitened pixel signatures (not the original pixels), band selection performance can be comparable to or even better than that from using all the pixels. For this approach, parallel computing is im-plemented for pixel selection only, since computational complexity in band selection has been greatly reduced.

40|$|Despite {{a massive}} {{research}} effort to elucidate Alzheimer's disease (AD) in recent decades, effective treatment remains elusive. This failure {{may relate to}} an oversimplification of the pathogenic processes underlying AD and also {{lack of understanding of}} AD progression during its long latent stages. Although evidence shows that the two specific neuropathological hallmarks in AD (neuronal loss and protein accumulation), which are opposite in nature, do not progress in parallel, the great majority of studies have focused on only one of these aspects. Furthermore, research focusing on single structures is likely to render an incomplete picture of AD pathogenesis because as AD involves complete brain networks, potential compensatory mechanisms within the network may ameliorate impairment of the system to a certain extent. Here, we describe an approach for enabling integrative analysis of the dual-nature lesions, simultaneously, in all components of one of the brain networks most vulnerable to AD. This approach is based on significant development of methods previously described mainly by our group that were optimized and complemented for this study. It combines unbiased stereology with immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence, making use of advanced <b>graphics</b> <b>computing</b> for three-dimensional (3 D) volume reconstructions. Although this study was performed in human brainstem and focused in AD, it may be applied to the study of any neurological disease characterized by dual-nature lesions, in humans and animal models. This approach does not require a high level of investment in new equipment and a significant number of specimens can be processed and analyzed within a funding cycle. © 2014 Elsevier B. V...|$|E

This work used such tools for educational purposes and {{was divided into}} three modules. Module 1 evaluated the use of simplified textual communication (slogans) about the subject Sexually Transmitted Diseases. It was applied to third-year medical students, which had not taken the course on this theme. To evaluate {{the impact of the}} textual communication form (slogans), long phrases were elaborated in scientific language containing 15 topics. From these long phrases, compact phrases were developed using techniques of the advertising area for elaboration of slogans. Three forms of didactic material about that theme were developed. The first form consisted of long phrases in descriptive topics, using scientific language. The second was constituted exclusively of compact phrases in the form of slogans, and the third was composed of the combination of the two previous forms. Then, 10 multiple-choice questions were elaborated and applied in two phases. In the first phase, application occurred immediately after the reading of didactic texts; in the second phase, it happened 60 days after the reading. For statistical analysis, Snedcor's F test was used for analysis of variance, at 5 % significance level. There was an increase in memorization by students who read the material containing the association between long phrases and slogans, which indicates that the latter, when used as an auxiliary model of learning, can bring significant benefits for education.
