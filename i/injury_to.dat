5|$|Actual or {{impending}} airway obstruction is {{a common}} indication for intubation of the trachea. Life-threatening airway obstruction may occur when a foreign body becomes lodged in the airway; this is especially common in infants and toddlers. Severe blunt or penetrating <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> the face or neck may be accompanied by swelling and an expanding hematoma, or <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> the larynx, trachea or bronchi. Airway obstruction is also common in people who have suffered smoke inhalation or burns within or near the airway or epiglottitis. Sustained generalized seizure activity and angioedema are other common causes of life-threatening airway obstruction which may require tracheal intubation to secure the airway.|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to completeness of injury, {{the location of}} damage on the spinal cord influences how much sexual function is retained or regained after injury. Injuries can occur in the cervical (neck), thoracic (back), lumbar (lower back), or sacral (pelvic) levels. Between each pair of vertebrae, spinal nerves branch off of the spinal cord and carry information to and from specific parts of the body. The location of <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> the spinal cord maps to the body, and the area of skin innervated by a specific spinal nerve, is called a dermatome. All dermatomes {{below the level of}} <b>injury</b> <b>to</b> the spinal cord may lose sensation.|$|E

5000|$|Posterolateral corner {{injuries}} (PLC injuries) of {{the knee}} are <b>injuries</b> <b>to</b> a complex area formed by the interaction of multiple structures. <b>Injuries</b> <b>to</b> the posterolateral corner can be debilitating to the person and require recognition and treatment to avoid long term consequences. [...] <b>Injuries</b> <b>to</b> the PLC often occur {{in combination with other}} ligamentous <b>injuries</b> <b>to</b> the knee; most commonly the anterior cruciate ligament (ACL) and posterior cruciate ligament (PCL). As with any injury, an understanding of the anatomy and functional interactions of the posterolateral corner is important to diagnosing and treating the injury.|$|R

5|$|The {{recurrent}} laryngeal nerves may {{be injured}} {{as a result}} of trauma, during surgery, {{as a result of}} tumour spread, or due to other means. <b>Injury</b> <b>to</b> the recurrent laryngeal nerves can result in a weakened voice (hoarseness) or loss of voice (aphonia) and cause problems in the respiratory tract. <b>Injury</b> <b>to</b> the nerve may paralyze the posterior cricoarytenoid muscle on the same side. This is the sole muscle responsible for opening the vocal cords, and paralysis may cause difficulty breathing (dyspnea) during physical activity. <b>Injury</b> <b>to</b> both the right and left nerve may result in more serious damage, such as the inability to speak. Additional problems may emerge during healing, as nerve fibres that re-anastamose may result in vocal cord motion impairment, uncoordinated movements of the vocal cord.|$|E
