50|$|There {{are several}} factors that {{determine}} {{the value of}} a backlink. Backlinks from authoritative sites on a given topic are highly valuable. If both sites have content geared toward the keyword topic, the backlink is considered relevant and believed to have strong influence on the search engine rankings of the web page granted the backlink. A backlink represents a favorable 'editorial vote' for the receiving webpage from another granting webpage. Another important factor is the anchor text of the backlink. Anchor text is the <b>descriptive</b> <b>labeling</b> of the hyperlink as it appears on a web page. Search engine bots (i.e., spiders, crawlers, etc.) examine the anchor text to evaluate how relevant it is to the content on a webpage. Anchor text and webpage content congruency are highly weighted in search engine results page (SERP) rankings of a webpage with respect to any given keyword query by a search engine user.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — Understanding human {{activities}} and object affor-dances {{are two very}} important skills, especially for personal robots which operate in human environments. In this work, we consider the problem of extracting a <b>descriptive</b> <b>labeling</b> of the sequence of sub-activities being performed by a human, and more importantly, of their interactions with the objects {{in the form of}} associated affordances. Given a RGB-D video, we jointly model the {{human activities}} and object affordances as a Markov random field where the nodes represent objects and sub-activities, and the edges represent the relationships between object affordances, their relations with sub-activities, and their evolution over time. We formulate the learning problem using a structural support vector machine (SSVM) approach, where labelings over various alternate temporal segmentations are considered as latent variables. We tested our method on a challenging dataset comprising 120 activity videos collected from 4 subjects, and obtained an accuracy of 79. 4 % for affordance, 63. 4 % for sub-activity and 75. 0 % for high-level activity labeling. We then demonstrate the use of such <b>descriptive</b> <b>labeling</b> in performing assistive tasks by a PR 2 robot. 1 I...|$|E

40|$|A {{system for}} {{morphing}} {{the warmth of}} a sound independently from its other timbral attributes was coded, building on previous work morphing brightness only (1), and morphing brightness and softness (2). The new warmth-softness-brightness morpher was perceptually validated using a series of listening tests. A Multidimensional Scaling analysis of listener responses to paired-comparisons showed perceptually orthogonal movement in two dimensions within a warmth-morphed and everything-else-morphed stimulus set. A verbal elicitation experiment showed that listeners’ <b>descriptive</b> <b>labeling</b> of these dimensions was as intended. A further ‘quality control’ experiment provided evidence that no ‘hidden’ timbral attributes were altered in parallel with the intended ones.
