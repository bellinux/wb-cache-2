5|$|Grant was on {{assignment}} in November 1963 to cover President John F. Kennedy's trip from Washington, D.C., to Dallas. One of his photographs made the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> November 22 {{edition of the}} Morning News; a copy {{is believed to be}} the last thing Kennedy ever signed. Grant also would make several pictures at Parkland Memorial Hospital within minutes after Kennedy's motorcade arrived following the shooting in Dealey Plaza.|$|E

5|$|Initially, {{coverage}} of the assault in Bernas was slow. The murder had occurred {{too late in the}} evening to be covered in the 14 August edition, and head editor Kusfandhi– due to press censorship– was uncomfortable with covering a politically charged case. However, other staff members convinced him to give greater coverage, and the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> 15 August edition showed Udin covered in bandages and gave detailed information about the case. On 16 August, Udin died without having regained consciousness; on the morning of his death, a breathing tube had been inserted.|$|E
5|$|On Sunday May 21, 1950, Barnett Newman {{took the}} signed {{statement}} to the city editor of the New York Times.

Satirists have also compared Zapatero to Mr. Bean when discussing government policies that are deemed to have been unsuccessful.|$|E

The research involved a detailed analysis <b>of</b> 2, 448 <b>front</b> <b>pages</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> five main Basque newspapers, with a total of 19, 156 news items. A specific methodology was developed for this work, enabling both a quantitative and qualitative analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> news stories to be made.

5|$|A coronial inquiry was {{conducted}} by the acting district officer in Talasea, which did not find a cause of death but concluded {{that there were no}} suspicious circumstances. It is believed that he died of complications from his war wounds. The men of the 10th Battalion AIF Club contacted his widow to ask that his remains be reinterred in the AIF Cemetery, Adelaide, South Australia, and offered their assistance, but she declined, choosing to have him remain buried on Garua Island in New Guinea. On 23 April 1927, a photograph of Wilder-Neligan's grave was published on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Adelaide newspaper, The Mail, along with a summary of his exploits during the war.|$|E

5|$|For {{her actions}} {{in the battle for}} the village of Kozyi Gory (Smolensk Oblast), Shanina was awarded her first {{military}} decoration, the Order of Glory 3rd Class on 17 April 1944. She became the first Soviet female sniper and the first servicewoman of the 3rd Belorussian Front to receive that order. According to the report of Major Degtyarev (the commander of the 1138th Rifle Regiment), she received the award for the corresponding commendation list, between 6 and 11 April Shanina killed 13 enemy soldiers while subjected to artillery and machine gun fire. By May 1944, her sniper tally increased to 17 confirmed enemy kills, and Shanina was praised as a precise and brave soldier. The same year, on 9 June, Shanina's portrait was featured on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Soviet newspaper Unichtozhim Vraga.|$|E
5|$|Two {{other works}} were pivotal in framing {{the image of}} buyout firms. Barbarians at the Gate, the 1990 best seller about the fight over RJR Nabisco linked private equity to hostile takeovers and assaults on management. A {{blistering}} story on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Wall Street Journal the same year about KKR's buyout of the Safeway supermarket chain painted a much more damaging picture. The piece, which later won a Pulitzer Prize, began with the suicide of a Safeway worker in Texas who had been laid off {{and went on to}} chronicle how KKR had sold off hundreds of stores after the buyout and slashed jobs.|$|E
5|$|Roy of the Rovers first {{appeared}} on 11 September 1954, as a weekly feature in the comic magazine Tiger, debuting on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> first issue. After 22years of continued popularity, the strip was judged successful enough to sustain its own weekly comic, the eponymous Roy of the Rovers, launched on 25 September 1976. The comic ran for 851issues, until 20 March 1993, and included other football strips and features. At {{the peak of the}} comic's success about 450,000 copies were sold each week. There were also hardback annuals and holiday specials featuring a mix of reprinted and original content, and for a brief period, starting in 1986, Roy of the Rovers was serialised in the now defunct Today newspaper. These were all-new strips, focusing largely on the relationship between Roy and his wife Penny, rather than the action on the pitch. Between 1988 and 1993, a Best of Roy of the Rovers monthly comic was published, reprinting older stories.|$|E

5|$|Several {{days before}} President Kennedy made his November flight to Texas, Grant had been {{assigned}} to cover the state's delegation in Washington, D.C., then fly back with the White House press corps; he was the only photographer to make the trip. At Dallas Love Field, Grant made the only published photograph from that visit of the president and Jacqueline Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Lady Bird Johnson, and Texas Governor John Connally and Nellie Connally, all in the same image. Another of Grant's photos, from San Antonio's Aerospace Medicine Center, was published on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dallas Morning News on November 22; a copy was signed that morning by President Kennedy—across the photo, to Jan White—and {{is believed to be the}} last item he signed before he climbed aboard the presidential limousine for his intended trip to the Dallas Trade Mart.|$|E
5|$|The {{disaster}} and investigation received widespread media coverage. The {{impact on the}} public was increased by the dramatic effect of an amateur photo taken of the aircraft rolling that was published on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Chicago Tribune on the Sunday two days after the crash. There were some early reports that a collision with a small aircraft had been the cause of the crash. This apparently {{was the result of the}} discovery of small-aircraft parts among the wreckage at the crash site. National Transportation Safety Board vice-chairman Elwood T. Driver, in a press briefing, was photographed holding a broken bolt and nut, implying that these parts were a cause of the accident. The small-plane parts were subsequently determined to have been on the ground at the time of the crash, at the former general aviation Ravenswood Airport, a facility that had been out of service for a few years. An owner there had been selling used aircraft parts from a remaining hangar building.|$|E
5|$|The {{series has}} gained a strong {{popularity}} in not only Japan but also throughout the world. For instance, coverage of the anime appeared on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hong Kong free newspaper am730 on May 27, 2013, concerning its popularity within Hong Kong {{as well as in}} China and Taiwan. However, the series also attracted criticism: the South Korean Electronic Times magazine accused Attack on Titan of having a militaristic message that serves Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe's political leanings; while the series also resonated with Hong Kong youths who saw the invading Titans as a metaphor for mainland China. Hong Kong media commentator Wong Yeung-tat praised Isayama's style and the versatility of Attack on Titans setting, which opens itself to readers' various interpretations. In 2013, after media linked to a 2010 blog post by Isayama indicating that the design of the character Dot Pixis was based on the Imperial Japanese General Akiyama Yoshifuru, an Internet flame war about the general's war record (e.g. allowing the Port Arthur massacre to occur) ensued on his blog and included death threats to the author. Because many of the threats written in Japanese had grammatical errors, it is believed that they were written by people outside of Japan.|$|E

5|$|In the 1998 Winter Olympics, curling {{became a}} medal sport {{for the first}} time. Olympic trials were held in November 1997 to select Canada's representatives at the Olympics. The Schmirler rink {{finished}} first in the round robin, and defeated Shannon Kleibrink in the final with a score of 9–6, behind strong shot making from Schmirler and McCusker. Schmirler made a difficult in-off to win and clinch the berth to the Olympics. The 1998 Winter Olympics were held in Nagano, Japan. The Schmirler rink was among the favourites for gold, {{but there was a}} strong field in the event. After finishing the round robin in first place with six wins and one loss, Canada played their semifinal game against Great Britain's Kirsty Hay. The game was tied after regulation play and went to an extra end, where Schmirler barely made a draw with her last rock to win the game. In the final against Denmark's Helena Blach Lavrsen, Schmirler secured a win in nine ends, winning Canada the gold medal. After winning the gold medal, Sandra appeared on the <b>front</b> <b>page</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> New York Times. After the Olympics, the Schmirler rink was named 'Team of the Year' by the Canadian Press. The team were also inducted into the Canadian Curling Hall of Fame in 1999. After returning from the Olympics, Schmirler and her rink had to compete almost immediately in the Scott Tournament of Hearts as Team Canada. Schmirler and her team made the playoffs, and won the 3 vs. 4 playoff game before dropping the semifinal to Anne Merklinger. After losing in the semis, Schmirler joined CBC as a colour commentator for the final match.|$|E
