40|$|CENP‐A {{containing}} nucleosomes epigenetically specify centromere {{position on}} chromosomes. Deposition of CENP‐A into chromatin is mediated by HJURP, a specific CENP‐A chaperone. Paradoxically, HJURP binding sterically prevents dimerization of CENP‐A, which {{is critical to}} form functional centromeric nucleosomes. A recent publication in The EMBO Journal (Zasadzińska et al, 2013) demonstrates that HJURP itself dimerizes through a C‐terminal repeat region, which is essential for centromeric assembly of nascent CENP‐A.

Centrioles/basal bodies (CBBs) are microtubule-based cylindrical organelles that nucleate the formation of centrosomes, cilia, and flagella. CBBs, cilia, and flagella are ancestral structures; they are present in all major eukaryotic groups. Despite the conservation of their core structure, there is variability in their architecture, function, and biogenesis.

40|$|Chromatin-based {{epigenetic}} inheritance cooperates with cis-acting DNA sequence {{information to}} propagate gene expression states and chromosome architecture across cell division cycles. Histone proteins and their modifications are central components of epigenetic systems but how, {{and to what}} extent, they are propagated {{is a matter of}} continued debate. Centromeric nucleosomes, marked by the histone H 3 variant CENP-A, are stable across mitotic divisions and are assembled in a locus specific and cell cycle controlled manner. The mechanism of inheritance of this unique chromatin domain has important implications for how general nucleosome transmission is controlled in space and time.

The SNAP-tag, a self labeling suicide enzyme, presents a tool with unique features that can be adopted for determining protein dynamics in living cells. Here we present detailed protocols {{for the use of}} SNAP in fluorescent pulse-chase and quench-chase-pulse experiments. These time-slicing methods provide powerful tools to assay and quantify the fate and turnover rate of proteins of different ages. We cover advantages and pitfalls of SNAP-tagging in fixed- and live-cell studies and evaluate the recently developed fast-acting SNAPf variant.

40|$|The concerted {{evolution}} of morphological and behavioral specializations has compelling examples in ant castes. Unique to ants is a marked divergence between winged queens and wingless workers, but morphological specializations for behaviors {{on the ground}} have been overlooked. We analyzed thorax morphology of queens and workers in species from 21 of the 25 ant subfamilies. We uncovered unique skeletomuscular modifications in workers that presumably increase power and flexibility of head-thorax articulation, emphasizing that workers are not simply wingless versions of queens. We also identified two distinct types of queens and showed repeated evolutionary associations with strategies of colony foundation. Solitary founding queens that hunt have a more worker-like thorax. Our results reveal that ants invest in the relative size of thorax segments according to their tasks. Versatility of head movements allows for better manipulation of food and objects, which arguably contributed to the ants' ecological and evolutionary success.

40|$|Gene {{targeting}} protocols for mammalian cells remain {{inefficient and}} labor intensive. Here we describe FASTarget, a rapid, fluorescent cell sorting based strategy to isolate rare gene targeting events in human somatic cells. A fluorescent protein {{is used as}} a means for direct selection of targeted clones obviating the need for selection and outgrowth of drug resistant clones. Importantly, the use of a promoter-less, ATG-less construct greatly facilitates the recovery of correctly targeted cells. Using this method we report successful gene targeting in up to 94 % of recovered human somatic cell clones. We create functional EYFP-tagged knockin clones in both transformed and non-transformed human somatic cell lines providing a valuable tool for mammalian cell biology. We further demonstrate the use of this technology to create gene knockouts. Using this generally applicable strategy we can recover gene targeted clones within approximately one month from DNA construct delivery to obtaining targeted monoclonal cell lines.

40|$|Rhomboid intramembrane proteases are the {{enzymes that}} release active {{epidermal}} growth factor receptor (EGFR) ligands in Drosophila and C. elegans, but {{little is known about}} their functions in mammals. Here we show that the mammalian rhomboid protease RHBDL 4 (also known as Rhbdd 1) promotes trafficking of several membrane proteins, including the EGFR ligand TGFα, from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi apparatus, thereby triggering their secretion by extracellular microvesicles. Our data also demonstrate that RHBDL 4 -dependent trafficking control is regulated by G-protein coupled receptors, suggesting a role for this rhomboid protease in pathological conditions, including EGFR signaling. We propose that RHBDL 4 reorganizes trafficking events within the early secretory pathway in response to GPCR signaling. Our work identifies RHBDL 4 as a rheostat that tunes secretion dynamics and abundance of specific membrane protein cargoes.

40|$|The centromere, {{responsible}} for chromosome segregation during mitosis, is epigenetically defined by CENP-A containing chromatin. The amount of centromeric CENP-A has direct implications {{for both the}} architecture and epigenetic inheritance of centromeres. Using complementary strategies, we determined that typical human centromeres contain ∼ 400 molecules of CENP-A, which is controlled by a mass-action mechanism. This number, despite representing only ∼ 4 % of all centromeric nucleosomes, forms a ∼ 50 -fold enrichment to the overall genome. In addition, although pre-assembled CENP-A is randomly segregated during cell division, this amount of CENP-A is sufficient to prevent stochastic loss of centromere function and identity. Finally, we produced a statistical map of CENP-A occupancy at a human neocentromere and identified nucleosome positions that feature CENP-A in a majority of cells. In summary, we present a quantitative view of the centromere that provides a mechanistic framework for both robust epigenetic inheritance of centromeres and the paucity of neocentromere formation.

40|$|All {{living organisms}} require {{accurate}} mechanisms to faithfully inherit their genetic material during cell division. The centromere {{is a unique}} locus on each chromosome that supports a multiprotein structure called the kinetochore. During mitosis, the kinetochore is responsible for connecting chromosomes to spindle microtubules, allowing faithful segregation of the duplicated genome. In most organisms, centromere position and function is not defined by the local DNA sequence context but rather by an epigenetic chromatin-based mechanism. Centromere protein A (CENP-A) is central to this process, as chromatin assembled from this histone H 3 variant is essential for assembly of the centromere complex, {{as well as for}} its epigenetic maintenance. As a major determinant of centromere function, CENP-A assembly requires tight control, both in its specificity for the centromere and in timing of assembly. In the last few years, there have been several new insights into the molecular mechanism that allow this process to occur. We will review these here and discuss the general implications of the mechanism of cell cycle coupling of centromere inheritance.

To gain insight into nucleosome dynamics, and to follow how dynamics change during differentiation, we used a technique called time-ChIP to quantitatively assess histone H 3. 3 turnover genome-wide during differentiation of mouse ESCs. We found that, without prior assumptions, high turnover {{could be used to}} identify regions involved in gene regulation. High turnover was seen at enhancers, as observed previously, with particularly high turnover at super-enhancers. In contrast, regions associated with the repressive Polycomb-Group showed low turnover in ESCs. Turnover correlated with DNA accessibility. Upon differentiation, numerous changes in H 3. 3 turnover rates were observed, the majority of which occurred at enhancers. Thus, time-ChIP measurement of histone turnover shows that active enhancers are unusually dynamic in ESCs and changes in highly dynamic nucleosomes predominate at enhancers during differentiation.

In the context of changes in administration of economy and a high inflation rate, in particular.

40|$|Background: Huntington’s disease (HD) is an {{autosomal}} dominant neurodegenerative disorder {{caused by the}} abnormal expansion of a CAG triplet repeat tract in the huntingtin gene. While the length of this CAG expansion is the major determinant {{of the age of}} onset (AO), other genetic factors have also been shown to play a modulatory role. Recent evidence suggests that neuroinflammation is a pivotal factor in the pathogenesis of HD, and that targeting this process may have important therapeutic ramifications. The human β-defensin 2 (hBD 2) – encoded by DEFB 4 – is an antimicrobial peptide that exhibits inducible expression in astrocytes during inflammation and is an important regulator of innate and adaptive immune response. Therefore, DEFB 4 may contribute to the neuroinflammatory processes observed in HD. Objective: In this study we tested the hypothesis that copy number variation (CNV) of the β-defensin region, including DEFB 4, modifies the AO in HD. Methods and results: We genotyped β-defensin CNV in 490 HD individuals using the paralogue ratio test and found no association between β-defensin CNV and onset of HD. Conclusions: We conclude that it is unlikely that DEFB 4 plays a role in HD pathogenesis. AV is supported by Fundação para Ciência e a Tecnologia (SFRH/BD/ 4764 / 2008).

40|$|The {{molecular}} motor dynein concentrates at the kinetochore region of mitotic chromosomes in animals to accelerate spindle microtubule capture and to control spindle checkpoint signaling. In this study, {{we describe the}} molecular mechanism used by the Rod-Zw 10 -Zwilch complex and the adaptor Spindly to recruit dynein to kinetochores in Caenorhabditis elegans embryos and human cells. We show that Rod's N-terminal beta-propeller and the associated Zwilch subunit bind Spindly's C-terminal domain, and we identify a specific Zwilch mutant that abrogates Spindly and dynein recruitment in vivo and Spindly binding to a Rod beta-propeller-Zwilch complex in vitro. Spindly's N-terminal coiled-coil uses distinct motifs to bind dynein light intermediate chain and the pointed-end complex of dynactin. Mutations in these motifs inhibit assembly of a dynein-dynactin-Spindly complex, and a null mutant of the dynactin pointed-end subunit p 27 prevents kinetochore recruitment of dynein-dynactin without affecting other mitotic functions of the motor. Conservation of Spindly-like motifs in adaptors involved in intracellular transport suggests a common mechanism for linking dynein to cargo.

40|$|The {{centriole}} and {{basal body}} (CBB) structure nucleates cilia and flagella, {{and is an}} essential component of the centrosome, underlying eukaryotic microtubule-based motility, cell division and polarity. In recent years, components of the CBB-assembly machinery have been identified, but little is known about their regulation and evolution. Given the diversity of cellular contexts encountered in eukaryotes, but the remarkable conservation of CBB morphology, we asked whether general mechanistic principles could explain CBB assembly. We analysed the distribution of each component of the human CBB-assembly machinery across eukaryotes as a strategy to generate testable hypotheses. We found an evolutionarily cohesive and ancestral module, which we term UNIMOD and is defined by three components (SAS 6, SAS 4 /CPAP and BLD 10 /CEP 135), that correlates with the occurrence of CBBs. Unexpectedly, other players (SAK/PLK 4, SPD 2 /CEP 192 and CP 110) emerged in a taxon-specific manner. We report that gene duplication {{plays an important role in}} the evolution of CBB components and show that, in the case of BLD 10 /CEP 135, this is a source of tissue specificity in CBB and flagella biogenesis. Moreover, we observe extreme protein divergence amongst CBB components and show experimentally that there is loss of cross-species complementation among SAK/PLK 4 family members, suggesting species-specific adaptations in CBB assembly. We propose that the UNIMOD theory explains the conservation of CBB architecture and that taxon- and tissue-specific molecular innovations, gained through emergence, duplication and divergence, play important roles in coordinating CBB biogenesis and function in different cellular contexts.

It has been postulated that C. parapsilosis clinical isolates result from a recent global expansion of a virulent clone. However, {{the availability of a}} single genome for this species has so far prevented testing this hypothesis at genomic scales. We present here the sequence of three additional strains from clinical and environmental samples. Our analyses reveal unexpected patterns of genomic variation, shared among distant strains, that argue against the clonal expansion hypothesis. All strains carry independent expansions involving an arsenite transporter homolog, pointing to the existence of directional selection in the environment, and independent origins of the two clinical isolates. Furthermore, we report the first evidence for the existence of recombination in this species. Altogether, our results shed new light onto the dynamics of genome evolution in C. parapsilosis.

They regulate epidermal growth factor receptor signalling in Drosophila by releasing signalling ligands from their transmembrane tethers.

We used a quantitative proteomics approach to investigate the substrate repertoire of rhomboid protease RHBDL 2 in human cells. We reveal a range of novel substrates that are specifically cleaved by RHBDL 2, including the interleukin- 6 receptor (IL 6 R), cell surface protease inhibitor Spint- 1, the collagen receptor tyrosine kinase DDR 1, N-Cadherin, CLCP 1 /DCBLD 2, KIRREL, BCAM and others. We further demonstrate that these substrates can be shed by endogenously expressed RHBDL 2 and that a subset of them is resistant to shedding by cell surface metalloproteases. The expression profiles and identity of the substrates implicate RHBDL 2 in physiological or pathological processes affecting epithelial homeostasis.

40|$|Decisions on {{hydroelectric}} dam construction will {{be critical}} in shaping the future of Amazonia, where planned dams would convert most tributaries into chains of reservoirs. The Santo Antônio and Jirau dams, now nearing completion on the Madeira River, have created dangerous precedents in a trend towards weakening environmental protection in Brazil. Political appointees have overruled the technical staff of the Brazilian Institute for the Environment and Renewable Natural Resources (IBAMA), {{which is responsible for}} evaluating the environmental impact study (EIA) and for licensing dams. <b>Installation</b> licences were <b>granted</b> without satisfying many of the 'conditions' that had been established as prerequisites. This feature and several others of the licensing process for the Madeira River dams have now been repeated in licensing the controversial Belo Monte Dam on the Xingu River. Brazil plans to build 30 large dams in its Amazon region in a decade, and others are to be financed and built by Brazil in Peru, Bolivia, Ecuador and Guyana. These plans affect virtually all water resources in an area larger than Western Europe. The Madeira River dams indicate the need to reform the decision-making process in Brazil...|$|R
5000|$|In {{its second}} year, the {{government}} announced further cuts to the FIT scheme. On 3 March the tariff was cut to 21p/kWh. This cut was originally scheduled for 12 December 2011 but was delayed, following a successful joint appeal to the High Court by Friends of the Earth and two solar companies, Solar Century and HomeSun. The 1 August review of the FIT brought an additional cut to 16p/kWh. The cut was partnered with a rise in export rate (the price at which the homeowner can sell excess electricity back to the supplier) from 3.1p to 4.5p for every kWh of electricity exported to the grid. The latest cut came into effect on 1 November, the tariff dropping to 15.44p/kWh, and this rate is set to remain until 1 February 2013. In addition to this, generators with more than 25 Solar PV <b>installations</b> were <b>granted</b> a 10% increase in the amount they receive of the FIT, from 80% to 90%, this however will not be likely to affect domestic users. The cut in FITs {{was due to the}} falling installation costs, and the fact that people were applying for the feed-in tariff scheme in numbers exceeding DECC forecasts and funding allocations. The aforementioned rates would only affect new installations - existing schemes would not be affected [...] The new tariffs would also now be paid over 20 years instead of 25 years (It will remain linked to the Retail Price Index) with a review every three months based on solar PV uptake levels in the three different bands: domestic (size 0-10 kW), small commercial (10-50 kW) and large commercial (above 50 kW and standalone installations). Despite suggestions that the European solar market is in decline, a report [...] by the International Energy Agency has shown that for a {{second year in a row}} solar PV was the dominant form of new electricity installation during 2012, ahead of both wind and gas power.|$|R
50|$|On August 30, 1999, a UN-mandated {{referendum}} {{for independence}} in East Timor was held, in which 78.5 {{percent of the}} electorate opted for independence. However, indigenous militias who opposed East Timor's independence caused devastating violence. Accordingly, the UN Security Council adopted a resolution to <b>grant</b> <b>installation</b> of the International Forces in East Timor (INTERFET), and the UN Secretary General together with the government of Australia officially requested the South Korean government's participation, in addition to other UN-member nations such as Indonesia, who agreed to the deployment of the multinational forces and actively requested the participation of Asian nations.In response to the international request to maintain security and restore order, the South Korean government authorized the formation of a second Evergreen Unit. With a battalion strength of 419 personnel—201 from ROK Special Forces with the balance of personnel from transportation, supply, communications, and medical specialties—the Evergreen unit arrived in Lautem, East Timor on 1 October 1999. Upon their arrival, the area was still reeling from post-election violence and 40 per cent of the island's built-up infrastructure—including markets, schools and housing—had been destroyed by rioters. The population of 50,000 had dropped to 20,000 as a result of refugee movement in response to the widespread violence. Shortly thereafter, the 2nd Evergreen Unit formally initiated operations on 22 October 1999 in Lospalos, East Timor. Using its security component, detached from the 5th Special Forces brigade, Special Warfare Command, the Evergreen's area of responsibility covered just 12% of East Timor's land mass.|$|R
