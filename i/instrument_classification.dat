40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the use of}} a patient <b>classification</b> <b>instrument</b> as a guide to plan nursing discharge. METHODS: Exploratory descriptive study performed in hospitalization units of Medical and Surgical Practice at a teaching hospital in São José do Rio Preto - SP, Brazil. The sample was made up of 50 patients who received discharge guidance from seven clinical nurses and supervisors. The sample collection occurred in two steps after the record of the discharge guidance, performed by nurses with and without the aid of a <b>classification</b> <b>instrument.</b> RESULTS: The findings show that nurses are more likely to comply with care areas in the psychobiological dimension. However, when they use the instrument, the psychosocial dimension is also benefited. CONCLUSION: The use of a patient <b>classification</b> <b>instrument</b> guided the planning of nursing discharge, enabling a more comprehensive and more thorough identification of care areas that require attention...|$|R
40|$|The {{payments}} {{market is}} a dynamic market. Novel payment instruments are being launched at a fast clip. Unfortunately, a classification that adequately distinguishes all possible payment instruments by their most relevant characteristics is missing in the literature. In this paper a classification system is introduced that – just like a matryoshka doll – consists of multiple nested layers. The classification has five layers, comprising the type of money, the core payment mechanism, the channels and networks involved, the form factor and authentication device used, and, ultimately, seven generic payment methods. The idea is that a specific combination of features {{from each of the}} five layers ultimately defines a real-life payment instrument. Besides its comprehensiveness, the added value of the classification is that it reveals the true nature of a payment instrument, which on closer scrutiny may not be all that novel. Payment <b>instruments,</b> <b>classification,</b> money, technology...|$|R

5|$|There {{are many}} {{different}} methods of classifying musical instruments. Various methods examine aspects such as the physical properties of the instrument (material, color, shape, etc.), the use for the instrument, {{the means by which}} music is produced with the instrument, the range of the instrument, and the instrument's place in an orchestra or other ensemble. Most methods are specific to a geographic area or cultural group and were developed to serve the unique classification requirements of the group. The problem with these specialized classification schemes is that they tend to break down once they are applied outside of their original area. For example, a system based on instrument use would fail if a culture invented a new use for the same instrument. Scholars recognize Hornbostel-Sachs as the only system that applies to any culture and, more important, provides only possible <b>classification</b> for each <b>instrument.</b> The most common types of <b>instrument</b> <b>classifications</b> are strings, brass, woodwind, and percussion.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: {{to assess}} the {{construct}} validity and reliability of the Pediatric Patient <b>Classification</b> <b>Instrument.</b> METHODS: correlation study developed at a teaching hospital. The classification involved 227 patients, using the pediatric patient <b>classification</b> <b>instrument.</b> The construct validity was assessed through the factor analysis approach and reliability through internal consistency. RESULTS: the Exploratory Factor Analysis identified three constructs with 67. 5 % of variance explanation and, in the reliability assessment, the following Cronbach's alpha coefficients were found: 0. 92 for the instrument as a whole; 0. 88 for the Patient domain; 0. 81 for the Family domain; 0. 44 for the Therapeutic procedures domain. CONCLUSIONS: the instrument evidenced its construct validity and reliability, and these analyses indicate the feasibility of the instrument. The validation of the Pediatric Patient <b>Classification</b> <b>Instrument</b> still represents a challenge, due to its relevance {{for a closer look}} at pediatric nursing care and management.

Rough and soft set-based dimensionality reduction can be considered as machine learning approaches for feature selection. In this paper, the authors applied these approaches for data cleansing and feature selection technique of Traditional Malay musical <b>instrument</b> sound <b>classification.</b> The data cleansing technique is developed based on matrices computation of multi-soft sets while feature selection using maximum attributes dependency based on rough set theory. The modeling process comprises eight phases: data acquisition, sound editing, data representation, feature extraction, data discretization, data cleansing, feature selection, and feature validation via classification.
