500|$|She {{changed her}} {{direction}} of study {{when she became}} a municipal inspector for orphans in 1905. She maintained the position from 1905 to 1909. This endeavor attributes largely to part of her own goal to improve the social sphere. However, her home's [...] "Jewish atmosphere" [...] widely influenced her as she was taught to [...] "pay it forward." [...] Including and prior to this job, all of her endeavors were based on her own emotions and goals without Albert's influence. In one of his letters, he notes [...] "it is you who have won, happy {{to have found a}} task that will <b>fill</b> <b>your</b> life, and you’ve done it ahead of me", addressing her social work in Strasbourg's City Orphan Administration.|$|E
500|$|On June 7, 2010, UK {{broadcaster}} Channel 4 aired [...] on its E4 station. The documentary {{explored the}} American show choir phenomenon which inspired Glee. Narrated by Nick Grimshaw, it went {{behind the scenes}} with real-life glee clubs and detailed celebrity show choir alumni including Lance Bass, Ashton Kutcher, Blake Lively and Anne Hathaway. It was selected as recommended viewing by The Guardian, with the comment: [...] "it's a fascinating look at the real-life New Directions, and it's equally as crackers as its TV champion." [...] The newspaper's Lucy Mangan reviewed the documentary positively, writing: [...] "It will, one way or another, <b>fill</b> <b>your</b> heart to bursting", and commenting that: [...] "Glee, it turns out, is not a gloriously ridiculous, highly polished piece of escapism. It is cinéma vérité." [...] It was watched by 411,000 viewers, a 2.3% audience share.|$|E

500|$|... "Turn Up the Music" [...] is an uptempo {{electronic}} dance, {{and house}} song, which {{last for a}} duration of three minutes and forty-nine seconds. Instrumentation is provided by pulsating beats, synthesizers and percussion. Rap-Up described the production as [...] "synth-heavy". The song opens with Brown singing [...] "Turn up the music cause the sun just came up / Turn up the music {{if they try to}} turn us down / Turn up the music cause I'm trying to hear the speakers blow / Turn up the music, <b>fill</b> <b>your</b> cup and drink it down". It is then followed by repeated chants of [...] "If you're sexy and you know it put your hands up in the air". Jason Lipshutz of Billboard noted that the chanting was a reference to LMFAO's [...] "Sexy and I Know It" [...] (2011). Andy Kellman of Allmusic likened the song to Baltimora's [...] "Tarzan Boy" [...] (1985).|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known chemical {{evidence of}} barley beer dates to circa 3500–3100 BC {{from the site}} of Godin Tepe in the Zagros Mountains of western Iran. Some of the earliest Sumerian writings contain references to beer; examples include a prayer to the goddess Ninkasi, known as [...] "The Hymn to Ninkasi", which served as both a prayer as well as a method of remembering the recipe for beer in a culture with few literate people, and the ancient advice (<b>Fill</b> <b>your</b> belly. Day and night make merry) to Gilgamesh, recorded in the Epic of Gilgamesh, by the ale-wife Siduri may, at least in part, have referred to the consumption of beer. The Ebla tablets, discovered in 1974 in Ebla, Syria, show that beer was produced in the city in 2500 BC. A fermented beverage using rice and fruit was made in China around 7000 BC. Unlike sake, mould was not used to saccharify the rice (amylolytic fermentation); the rice was probably prepared for fermentation by mastication or malting.|$|E
2500|$|Borlaug {{attributed}} {{his decision}} to leave the farm and pursue further education to his grandfather's urgent encouragement to learn: [...] Nels Olson Borlaug (1859–1935) once told him, [...] "you're wiser to <b>fill</b> <b>your</b> head now {{if you want to}} <b>fill</b> <b>your</b> belly later on." [...] When Borlaug applied for admission to the University of Minnesota in 1933, he failed its entrance exam, but was accepted at the school's newly created two-year General College. After two quarters, he transferred to the College of Agriculture's forestry program. As a member of University of Minnesota's varsity wrestling team, Borlaug reached the Big Ten semifinals, and promoted the sport to Minnesota high schools in exhibition matches all around the state.|$|E

2500|$|Qs Tom Doyle {{hailed the}} album, saying, [...] "These 10 {{magnificent}} songs see the singer and lyricist {{trying to get}} his head around life, death, love, the universe and what he calls 'the mysteries of the human heart'... Always musically sure-footed and prog-minded – less, of course, in terms of never-ending solos; more {{in the sense that you}} never know what's up next sonically – here Elbow stretch themselves musically without tearing up their original blueprint... Topping even The Seldom Seen Kid, The Take Off... is the perfect expression yet of everything that is Elbow. As their best album to date, it will lift yor heart and <b>fill</b> <b>your</b> soul." [...] Referring to the group's concert at Jodrell Bank in 2012, Mojos Victoria Segal noted, [...] "You don't need the world's largest radio telescope to pick up the issues of mortality and make-or-break change pulsing through the record... Plotting their course through these highs and lows – those take-offs and landings – Elbow are no clearer than anyone else about how they will reach the final destination. By sharing that uncertainty and navigating by what little light there is, artistically, at least, they never lose their way." ...|$|E

2500|$|Typical scripts for {{an average}} one-hour {{television}} show run 60 pages, but those for Moonlighting were nearly twice as long due to the fast talking overlapping dialogue of the main characters. While the average television show would take seven days to shoot, Moonlighting would take from 12–14 days to complete with episodes and dialogue frequently being written by Caron the same day they were shot. This attention to detail contributed to Moonlighting as {{being one of the}} most expensive television shows being produced at the time. Where most episodes would cost around $900,000 to produce, Moonlighting was running nearly double that. [...] The season 2 episode [...] "The Dream Sequence Always Rings Twice" [...] could have been filmed much more cheaply by being shot in color and then decolorized, but Caron insisted on the authentic look of black-and-white film which took 16 days to shoot, bringing the cost of the episode to the then-unheard-of sum of two million dollars. Caron often defended his filming practices in the name of giving the audience what they wanted and producing a quality product. He used the following analogy to illustrate the point, [...] "The thinking in television which makes no damn sense to me, is that a half hour of television costs X, and an hour of television costs Y, no matter what that television is, it strikes me as an insane hypothesis. The parallel is, you're hungry, whether you go to McDonald's or whether you go to '21,' it should cost the same; they both <b>fill</b> <b>your</b> stomach. It's nonsense." ...|$|E

2500|$|Over {{the next}} few years she {{revealed}} a talent for clarifying doctrine to those who had not received as much education as she. A kaleidoscope, whose three mirrors transform scraps of coloured paper into beautiful designs, provided an inspired illustration for the Holy Trinity. [...] "As long as our actions, even the smallest, do not fall away from the focus of Divine Love, the Holy Trinity, symbolized by the three mirrors, allows them to reflect wonderful beauty. Jesus, who regards us through the little lens, that is to say, through Himself, always sees beauty in everything we do. But if we left the focus of inexpressible love, what would He see? Bits of straw … dirty, worthless actions." [...] "Another cherished image was that of the newly invented elevator, a vehicle Thérèse used many times over to describe God's grace, a force that lifts us to heights we can't reach on our own." [...] Her sister Céline's memoir is filled with numerous examples of the teacher Thérèse. [...] "Céline: - 'Oh! When I think how much I have to acquire!' Thérèse: - 'Rather, how much you have to lose! Jesus Himself will <b>fill</b> <b>your</b> soul with treasures in the same measure that you move your imperfections out of the way." [...] And Céline recalled a story Thérèse told about egotism. 'The 28 month old Thérèse visited Le Mans and was given a basket filled with candies, at the top of which were two sugar rings. 'Oh! How wonderful! There is a sugar ring for Céline too!' On her way to the station however the basket overturned, and one of the sugar rings disappeared. 'Ah, I no longer have any sugar ring for poor Céline!' Reminding me of the incident she observed; 'See how deeply rooted in us is this self-love! Why was it Céline's sugar ring, and not mine, that was lost?' Martha of Jesus, a novice who spent her childhood in a series of orphanages and who was described by all as emotionally unbalanced, with a violent temper, gave witness during the beatification process of the 'unusual dedication and presence of her young teacher. [...] "Thérèse deliberately 'sought out the company of those nuns whose temperaments she found hardest to bear.' What merit was there in acting charitably toward people whom one loved naturally? Thérèse went {{out of her way to}} spend time with, and therefore to love, the people she found repellent. It was an effective means of achieving interior poverty, a way to remove a place to rest her head." ...|$|E
