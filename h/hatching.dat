5|$|In <b>hatching,</b> mambas break {{though the}} egg shell with an egg tooth and {{are born with}} fully {{developed}} venom glands; capable of inflicting a potentially lethal bite minutes after <b>hatching.</b> The body of the newly hatched snake contains the residues of the egg yolk, and assimilates them to sustain the young snake until it finds its first prey.|$|E
5|$|The Puerto Rican amazon reaches sexual {{maturity}} at {{between three and}} four years of age. It reproduces once a year and is a cavity nester. Once the female lays eggs she {{will remain in the}} nest and continuously incubate them until <b>hatching.</b> The chicks are fed by both parents and will fledge 60 to 65 days after <b>hatching.</b> This parrot's diet is varied and consists of flowers, fruits, leaves, bark and nectar obtained from the forest canopy.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch within between 23 and 32 {{hours of}} each other and can be preceded by the chick in the egg calling for up to 45 hours before <b>hatching.</b> One <b>hatching</b> was {{recorded}} as taking 15 hours to complete. Newly hatched chicks are covered by downy black plumage, the legs, feet and bill are black, and the mouth is silvery.|$|E

Sections of the coaming {{in way of}} the No. 1 <b>hatch</b> were fractured and buckled inward. The No. 2 <b>hatch</b> cover was missing and the coaming on the No. 2 <b>hatch</b> was fractured and buckled. <b>Hatches</b> Nos. 3 and 4 were covered with mud; one corner of <b>hatch</b> cover No. 3 {{could be seen in}} place. <b>Hatch</b> cover No. 5 was missing. A series of 16 consecutive <b>hatch</b> cover clamps were observed on the No. 5 <b>hatch</b> coaming. Of this series, the first and eighth were distorted or broken. All of the 14 other clamps were undamaged and in the open position. The No. 6 <b>hatch</b> was open and a <b>hatch</b> cover was standing on end vertically in the <b>hatch.</b> The <b>hatch</b> covers were missing from <b>hatches</b> Nos. 7 and 8 and both coamings were fractured and severely distorted. The bow section abruptly ended just aft of <b>hatch</b> No. 8 and the deck plating was ripped up from the separation to the forward end of <b>hatch</b> No. 7.|$|R

50|$|Each {{of the two}} {{berthing}} ports on Destiny {{contains a}} <b>hatch.</b> Both <b>hatches</b> are normally open, and remain open unless a situation arises requiring a module to be isolated. Each <b>hatch</b> has a window. The <b>hatches</b> can be opened or closed from either side. The <b>hatches</b> have a pressure interlock feature, which prevents the <b>hatch</b> from being opened {{if there is a}} negative pressure across the <b>hatch</b> (higher pressure {{on the outside of the}} <b>hatch).</b> The <b>hatch</b> opeinings are a square like six sided shape - which is associated to that module.|$|R

5|$|A <b>hatch</b> or {{hatchway}} is {{the opening}} {{at the top of}} a cargo hold. The mechanical devices which allow <b>hatches</b> to be opened and closed are called <b>hatch</b> cover. In general, <b>hatch</b> covers are between 45% and 60% of the ship's breadth, or beam, and 57% to 67% of the length of the holds. To efficiently load and unload cargo, <b>hatches</b> must be large, but large <b>hatches</b> present structural problems. Hull stress is concentrated around the edges of the <b>hatches,</b> and these areas must be reinforced. Often, <b>hatch</b> areas are reinforced by locally increasing the scantlings or by adding structural members called stiffeners. Both of these options have the undesired effect of adding weight to the ship.|$|R
50|$|On one {{occasion}} <b>Hatch</b> was serving a mission among the Mojave with Dudley Leavitt. The Mojave {{were going to}} kill <b>Hatch</b> and Leavitt, but <b>Hatch</b> offered a prayer for the people's hearts to be softened and they let <b>Hatch</b> and Leavitt go.|$|R
5|$|The {{period from}} <b>hatching</b> to {{pupation}} lasts 10 days to two years, exceptionally {{up to six}} years. Climate is a major factor, because development is slower in colder regions.|$|E
5|$|The {{young of}} a clutch hatch over {{two or three}} days and are brooded until their {{feathers}} develop and eyes open five days after <b>hatching.</b> The young are fed on insects until they fledge 16 to 25, typically 17, days after <b>hatching.</b> After this they are fed for one or two weeks. While feeding nestlings, the female is dominant over the male. Cape sparrows are among the main hosts of brood parasitism by the dideric cuckoo in southern Africa, and sometimes parasitise nests of their own species.|$|E
5|$|When hatched, {{the chicks}} are downy. Neither altricial nor precocial, the chicks {{begin to move}} around and explore their {{surroundings}} within one to three days after <b>hatching.</b> Usually they do not stray far from the nest. Chicks are brooded by the adults for the first ten days after <b>hatching.</b> Both parents care for hatchlings. Chick diets always include fish, and parents selectively bring larger prey items to chicks than they eat themselves. Males bring more food than females. Feeding by the parents lasts for roughly a month before being weaned off slowly. After fledging, the juveniles learn to feed themselves, including the difficult method of plunge-diving. They will fly south to winter {{with the help of}} their parents.|$|E

5000|$|The {{family of}} de <b>Hatch</b> succeeded Murdake at Woolleigh. The de <b>Hatch</b> family descended from Robert Atwater, son of William Atwater of South Molton, Devon, {{by his wife}} Jone de Wolrington, {{daughter}} and heiress of William de Wolrington of <b>Hatch</b> (alias Hach, Hacche, etc.) in the parish of South Molton. According to Risdon, <b>Hatch</b> was the [...] "lord of the royalty" [...] of South Molton, thus the principal estate within that royal manor and borough. The Wolringtons were themselves heirs of the original de <b>Hatch</b> family, which died out in the male line. On receiving his maternal inheritance Robert Atwater adopted the surname de <b>Hatch,</b> or <b>Hatch.</b> Robert's son was Thomas <b>Hatch,</b> who married Mabill Leigh, daughter and heiress of Thomas Leigh of Leigh, near Tiverton.|$|R
5|$|A clutch {{consists}} of 2 to 5 light green-grey eggs with darker spots. The mean clutch sizes of grey jays in Algonquin Provincial Park and La Verendrye Provincial Park were 3.03 and 3.18 eggs, respectively. Incubation is performed {{only by the}} female and lasts an average of 18.5 days. The female is fed on the nest by her partner, rarely moving from the nest during incubation and for several days after <b>hatching.</b>|$|E
5|$|About 45–50 {{days after}} <b>hatching,</b> the chicks form a crèche, huddling {{together}} for warmth and protection. During this time, both parents forage at sea and return periodically {{to feed their}} chicks. A crèche may comprise up to several thousand birds densely packed together and is essential for surviving the low Antarctic temperatures.|$|E
5|$|After {{the chicks}} hatch, the birds will desert their nest. Even though the young can swim and dive during this time, they rarely do, instead {{staying on the}} parents' backs for four days after <b>hatching.</b> After about 10 days, the parents split the chicks up, with each parent taking care of {{about half of the}} brood. After this split, the chicks are {{independent}} in about 10 days, and fledge in about three weeks.|$|E

The target function is {{the gravity of the}} <b>hatch</b> corner, and the constraint function is fatigue accumulation damage in the present paper. The structure optimal design theory has been combined with the fatigue life assessment method, to assess a <b>hatch</b> corner fatigue life of a large bulk carrier, and to optimize the <b>hatch</b> corner based on meeting the fatigue life. The <b>hatch</b> corner has been optimized under meeting yield strength and buckling strength. The numerical results show that the optimum method is fit to optimize the <b>hatch</b> corner...|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} ways to fire the {{explosive}} <b>hatch</b> during recovery. On {{the inside of the}} <b>hatch</b> was a knobbed plunger. The pilot could remove a pin and press the plunger with a force of 5 or 6 lbf (25 N). This would detonate the explosive charge, which would shear off the 70 bolts and propel the <b>hatch</b> 25 ft away in 1 s. If the pin was left in place, a force of 40 lbf (180 N) was required to detonate the <b>hatch.</b> An outside rescuer could blow open the <b>hatch</b> by removing a small panel near the <b>hatch</b> and pulling a lanyard. The explosive <b>hatch</b> weighed only 23 lb.|$|R
5|$|Black-shouldered kites form monogamous pairs, {{breeding}} between August and January. The birds {{engage in}} aerial courtship displays which involve high circling flight and ritualised feeding mid-air. Three or four eggs are laid and incubated for around thirty days. Chicks are fully fledged within {{five weeks of}} <b>hatching</b> and can hunt for mice {{within a week of}} leaving the nest. Juveniles disperse widely from the home territory.|$|E
5|$|Both species lay 3–5 {{normally}} whitish eggs blotched {{with brown}} or grey, which are incubated by the female alone. The chicks hatch after {{two to three}} weeks. Red-billed chough chicks are almost naked, but the chicks of the higher altitude Alpine chough hatch with a dense covering of natal down. The chicks are fed by both parents and fledge in 29–31 days after <b>hatching</b> for Alpine chough, and 31–41days for red-billed.|$|E
5|$|Broods {{that fail}} {{tend to do}} so during incubation. One English study showed that only 14.5% of eggs survived to <b>hatching,</b> but once that stage was reached the chances of {{fledging}} successfully were high. European nightjars breed when aged one year, and typically live for four years. The adult annual survival rate is 70%, but that for juveniles is unknown. The maximum known age in the wild is just over 12years.|$|E

5|$|C. mutica {{reproduce}} {{all throughout}} the year, with peak {{seasons in the}} summer months. Males are highly aggressive and exhibit sexual competition over the smaller females. The eggs, which average at 40 per female, are incubated for about 5 days at 22C in the female's brood pouch. Upon <b>hatching,</b> they reach sexual maturity in about 21 to 46 days. Their average lifespan in laboratory conditions is 68.8 days for males and 82 days for females.|$|E
5|$|During the {{breeding}} season, the diet of the American black duck consists of approximately 80% plant food and 20% animal food. The animal food diet increases to 85% during winter.
