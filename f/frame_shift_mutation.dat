Other mutations of NLGN 4 found in relation to autism spectrum disorders include a 2-bp deletion, 1253delAG, in the NLGN4 gene, which causes a frameshift and a premature stop codon. Another mutation is a hemizygous deletion in the NLGN4 gene encompassing exons 4, 5, and 6. The 757-kb deletion was predicted to result in a significantly truncated protein.|$|E

50|$|Research done using Zebrafish dackel (dak) {{have shown}} that in EXT2-/- Zebrafish, chondrocytes fail to undergo {{terminal}} differentiation and bone formation fails to progress from pre-osteoblasts stage to osteoblasts. Instead, abnormal lipid deposition and premature adipocyte differentiation takes place. The expression of xbp1, master regulator of osterix gets reduced, suggesting that unfolded proteins responses {{may play a role}} in pathogenesis of multiple osteochondroma. The research concludes that heparan sulphates are required for terminal differentiation and formation of scaffold that is needed for bone development. At least one copy of EXT2 gene is needed for proper bone development and to maintain the balance between bone and fat cell lineages. Due to homozygous loss of EXT2 function, leads to imbalance between cartilage, bone, and fat cell lineages. These observations in null zebrafish points toward the musculoskeletal defects observed in patients with multiple osteochondroma. Due to the findings of bone-fat imbalance in Zebra fish model, future studies should address status of lipid composition in patients with multiple osteochondroma.Research conducted using sequencing methods has identified a novel <b>frame</b> <b>shift</b> <b>mutation</b> at the glycosyltransferase domain (c.1457insG) located at codon 486 of exon 6 of the EXT1 gene, that causes multiple osteochondromas. This study was conducted in two multiple osteochondroma (MO) patients from the Chinese descent (same family) and the results were validated with four other members of the same MO family and 200 unrelated healthy subjects. The results of the mutations were validated using two different sequencing methods (Exome and Sanger). The results of immunohistochemistry and multiple sequence alignment supports the cause of MO being a mutation in EXT1 gene. However, the exact molecular mechanism of multiple osteochondroma remains unclear. The EXT1 gene encodes the endoplasmic reticulum-resident type II transmembrane glycosyltransferase, which catalyzes polymerization of heparin sulfate chain at the endoplasmic reticulum and the Golgi apparatus. Heparin sulfate regulates signal transduction during chondrocyte differentiation, ossification, and apoptosis. Malfunction in heparin sulfate synthesis causes chondrocytes to rapidly differentiate. Based on these results future studies should elucidate the underlying molecular mechanism of the glycosyltransferase domain of the EXT1 and its involvement in the development of multiple osteochondromas.Osteochondromas are associated with secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas, but the pathogenesis of the malignant bone tumor remains unknown. Research has demonstrated that chondrocytes with dysfunctional EXT1 is present in solitary osteochondromas, but the EXT1 is functional in sporadic (solitary) secondary peripheral chondrosarcomas. Research indicates that osteochondromas creates a special niche in which wild type cells are mixed in with EXT functional cells. Then these EXT functional cells undergo other mutations, that give rise to secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma, indicating the involvement of an alternative mechanism for the pathogenesis of secondary peripheral chondrosarcoma. Future studies should address the contributing gene that causes the formation of peripheral chondrosarcoma. It should also illustrate what causes chondrocytes functional with EXT1 and EXT2 within the osteochondroma to become more susceptible to mutations leading to malignancy.|$|E

The region, where the deletion occurred, represents a hot spot region in the La gene(s). It leads to a <b>frame</b> <b>shift</b> <b>mutation</b> and a premature stop codon eleven amino acids downstream of the deletion site within one of the protease sensitive regions of the La protein.

40|$|Background: The {{extracellular}} matrix protein 1 (ECM 1) is a glycoprotein, expressed in skin and other tissues. Loss-of-function mutation in ECM 1 causes a rare autosomal recessive disorder called lipoid proteinosis. Lipoid proteinosis is presented by {{varying degrees of}} skin scars, beaded papules along the eyelid margins, variable signs of hoarseness of voice and respiratory disorders. More than 250 cases of this disorder have been described in the literature, but occurrence of lipoid proteinosis in siblings is very rare. This {{study was designed to}} investigate the possible mutation causing lipoid proteinosis in a Pakistani family and to elaborate the scope of possible genetic changes, causing the genodermatosis in Pakistan. Main observations: In this study, two siblings (12 and 9 -years sisters) were presented with scaly itchy lesions on whole body, hoarse voice and macroglossia. Their deceased father had similar clinical manifestations but mother and younger brother were unaffected. Blood samples from clinically affected and unaffected family members were collected with informed consent. The coding region of ECM 1 gene containing 10 exons were amplified and sequenced. Both the affected siblings were shown to have homozygous <b>frame</b> <b>shift</b> <b>mutation</b> by deletion of the nucleotide T at 507, codon 169, exon 6. This resulted in a frame shift from codon 169 and appearance of a premature stop codon at 177, causing formation of a mutated protein (176 amino acids) instead of normal ECM 1 protein (540 amino acids). Conclusion: A case of homozygous 62 -bp insertion in ECM 1 gene causing lipoid proteinosis has been reported in another Pakistani family.

Most of the mutations reported are either nonsense <b>mutations</b> or <b>frame</b> <b>shift</b> <b>mutations</b> which would truncate the cytoplasmic carboxyl terminus of the beta or gamma subunits of the channel, suggesting that these domains are important for the normal regulation of this channel. We sequenced ENaC in a family with Liddle syndrome and found a missense mutation in beta subunit which predicts substitution of Tyr by His at codon 618, 2 bp downstream from a missense mutation (P 616 L) that has been reported recently. Presence of this mutation correlates with the clinical manifestations (hypertension, hypokalemia, suppressed aldosterone secretion) in this kindred. Functional expression studies in the Xenopus oocytes revealed constitutive activation of the Y 618 H mutant indistinguishable from that observed for the deletion mutant (R 564 stop) identified in the original pedigree of Liddle. Our data suggest that the region between Pro 616 and Tyr 618 is critically important for regulation of ENaC activity...|$|R
40|$|Lack {{of major}} {{involvement}} of human uroplakin genes in vesicoureteral reflux: Implications for disease heterogeneity. backgroundprimary vesicoureteral reflux (vur) is a hereditary disorder {{characterized by the}} retrograde flow of urine into the ureters and kidneys. it affects about 1 % of the young children and is thus {{one of the most}} common hereditary diseases. its associated nephropathy is an important cause of end-stage renal failure in children and adults. recent studies indicate that genetic ablation of mouse uroplakin (up) iii gene, which encodes a 47 kd urothelial-specific integral membrane protein forming urothelial plaques, causes vur and hydronephrosis. methodsto begin to determine whether mutations in up genes might play a role in human vur, we genotyped all four up genes in 76 patients with radiologically proven primary vur by polymerase chain reaction (pcr) amplification and sequencing of all their exons plus 50 to 150 bp of flanking intronic sequences. resultseighteen single nucleotide polymorphisms (snps) were identified, seven of which were missense, with no truncation or <b>frame</b> <b>shift</b> <b>mutations.</b> since healthy relatives of the vur probands are not reliable negative controls for vur, we used a population of 90 race-matched, healthy individuals, unrelated to the vur patients, as controls to perform an association study. most of the snps were not found to be significantly associated with vur. however, snp 1 of up ia gene affecting a c to t conversion and an ala 7 val change, and snp 7 of up iii affecting a c to g conversion and a pro 154 ala change, were marginally associated with vur (both p = 0. 08). studies of additional cases yielded a second set of data that, in combination with the first set, confirmed a weak association of up iii snp 7 in vur (p = 0. 036 adjusted for both subsets of cases vs. controls). conclusionsuch a weak association and the lack of families with simple dominant Mendelian inheritance suggest that missense changes of uroplakin genes cannot play a dominant role in causing VUR in humans, although they may be weak risk factors contributing to a complex polygenic disease. The fact that no truncation or <b>frame</b> <b>shift</b> <b>mutations</b> have been found in any of the VUR patients, coupled with our recent finding that some breeding pairs of UP III knockout mice yield litters that show not only VUR, but also severe hydronephrosis and neonatal death, raises the possibility that major uroplakin mutations could be embryonically or postnatally lethal in humans...|$|R
