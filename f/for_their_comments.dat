25|$|Winter {{wrote that}} Edmonds did not canvass {{the opinion of}} veterans, which was untrue—some volumes were sent to 1,000 or more {{officers}} <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>comments,</b> {{as well as being}} checked against unit diaries down to battalion level—in some cases entire chapters were rewritten (or in the case of Passchendaele, the volume was rewritten several times in the 1940s, during disputes about the roles of Haig and Hubert Gough, who was still alive). Winter quoted, out of context, Edmonds' advice to his researchers to write a draft narrative first, then invite interviewees to comment over lunch: Andrew Green, in his study of the Official History, wrote that this was done deliberately, for memories to be jogged by the draft narrative and that senior officers {{were more likely to be}} frank if approached informally. Winter doubted that Haig had passed out of Sandhurst top of his year or been awarded the Anson Sword but this was refuted by S. A. Anglim, who consulted the Sandhurst records.|$|E
500|$|Prior to {{the release}} of 1998's Follow the Leader, Gretchen Plewes, a Zeeland, Michigan high school {{assistant}} principal, said in an interview for a Michigan newspaper that Korn's music is [...] "indecent, vulgar, obscene and intends to be insulting" [...] after giving a student, Eric VanHoven, a one-day suspension for wearing a shirt with the Korn logo on it. WKLQ was filmed giving away hundreds of free Korn T-shirts, which were donated by the band, outside the school. Ottawa County policemen helped hand out shirts as well. Korn filed a cease and desist order against Plewes and the school district <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>comments.</b> They also threatened a multimillion-dollar lawsuit, but both actions were dropped due to the band members' personal lives.|$|E
500|$|In {{her book}} American Science Fiction TV, Jan Johnson-Smith noted that [...] "Tuvix" [...] {{is one of}} a {{recurring}} type of Star Trek episodes concerned with issues of individuality and self. [...] She thematically tied this episode to [...] episode [...] "" [...] where the transporter rends Captain Kirk into two separate representations of his psyche, Star Trek: Voyagers episode [...] "" [...] where hybrid Human/Klingon character B'Elanna Torres is split along her bloodline into two separate species, and s character of Jadzia Dax who is of a conjoined species (Trill) that repeatedly goes through a conjoining process when the host organism dies. [...] When asked regarding accusations of [...] "Tuvix" [...] and other Voyager episodes simply aping previous Star Trek series in this way, executive producer Michael Piller called out Time magazine <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>comments</b> on the matter before conceding, [...] got to keep new people coming in and pitching because otherwise you're going to be retreading an old ground." [...] Seven years later, when writing [...] "", Manny Coto would take pains to write that episode to be dissimilar to [...] "Tuvix".|$|E

50|$|In {{a desperate}} attempt to counter its bad reviews, Hemdale asked several movie critics to view the film with their {{children}}, and asked those children <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>comments</b> on the film; these were subsequently included in its newspaper promotion. Mentioned in the advertisements were Michael Medved's daughter, Sarah, and Bob Campbell's four-year-old daughter ("It gets 91 stars!"). The idea came from Hemdale executives who thought animated films from the Disney company were preferred over those from other studios.|$|E
