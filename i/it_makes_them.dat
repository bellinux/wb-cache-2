25|$|Krill {{typically}} {{follow a}} diurnal vertical migration. It has been assumed that they {{spend the day}} at greater depths and rise during the night toward the surface. The deeper they go, the more they reduce their activity, apparently to reduce encounters with predators and to conserve energy. Swimming activity in krill varies with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefore sink below the mixed layer. As they sink they produce feces which implies {{a role in the}} Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. Vertical migration may be a 2–3 times daily occurrence. Some species (e.g., Euphausia superba, E. pacifica, E. hanseni, Pseudeuphausia latifrons, and Thysanoessa spinifera) form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> extremely vulnerable to predators.|$|E

2500|$|There is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that publishing houses make large profits and that authors are the lowest paid in the publishing chain. However, most publishers make little profit from individual titles, with 75% of books not breaking even. Approximately 80% {{of the cost of}} a book is taken up by the expenses of preparing, distributing, and printing (with printing being one of the lowest costs of all). [...] On successful titles, publishing companies will usually make around 10% profit, with the author(s) receiving 8-15% of the retail price. However, given that authors are usually individuals, are often paid advances irrespective of whether the book turns a profit and do not normally have to split profits with others, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> the highest paid individuals in the publishing process.|$|E
2500|$|The issue many {{took with}} Lost Odyssey was its {{deliberately}} old-school gameplay mechanics, particularly the traditional combat system, which several critics {{found to be}} dull and dated, {{as well as the}} game's use of random battles, which were further deemed an issue by their purportedly lengthy load times. Xbox Focus gave the game a 4/5 rating, declaring its story as profound, but taking an issue with the camera control and the odd character design. Unlike other critics, however, Xbox Focus's Alex Yusupov deemed the combat and random battles as exhilarating, and that [...] "it's better to take a tried and true technique and make it better than introduce a completely new idea that could possibly screw up an entire game." [...] IGN found that the ring-building system, immortals, and skill system added a fresh feel to the game's otherwise traditional combat, and 1UP.com praised the [...] "timed button press" [...] aspect of the battles, saying <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> [...] "more engaging than you'd think." ...|$|E

After closing on Broadway they toured the show through twelve cities in the US, one in Canada and three in Switzerland. During 1962 and 1963, they revived the production in Canada and toured the British Isles, appearing in 17 towns and cities. During the tour they continually added new songs and dropped old ones; {{by the time they}} returned to the West End in October 1963 the programme was so different from that given at their last London appearance more than four years earlier that the show had a new title: At the Drop of Another Hat.|$|E
5000|$|A {{number of}} tracks {{displayed}} an antipathy towards religion, a stance that had been noted in isolated songs from early in Numan’s career but which became more pronounced on this album and its successors, Exile (1997) and Pure (2000). The single released from the album, [...] "A Question of Faith", appeared to cast the singer as a fallen angel ("I dare you to judge me / Now God has disowned me"), a theme that would dominate Exile, before concluding: [...] "They kneel down / Praise God / Shout Hallelujah ... When children kill children / Don’t <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> wonder? / Don’t <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> question their faith?"; the reference [...] "...when children kill children..." [...] was made about the then-recent murder of James Bulger. Numan later stated that whilst Exile was a fictional story, [...] "Sacrifice looks at my actual beliefs".|$|R

2500|$|Most krill, small shrimp-like crustaceans, form large swarms, {{sometimes}} reaching {{densities of}} 10,000–60,000 individual animals per cubic metre. Swarming is a defensive mechanism, confusing smaller predators {{that would like}} to pick out single individuals. The largest swarms are visible from space and can be tracked by satellite. One swarm was observed to cover an area of 450 square kilometers (175 square miles) of ocean, to a depth of 200 meters (650 feet) and was estimated to contain over 2 million tons of krill. Recent research suggests that krill do not simply drift passively in these currents but actually modify them. Krill typically follow a diurnal vertical migration. By moving vertically through the ocean on a 12-hour cycle, the swarms play a major part in mixing deeper, nutrient-rich water with nutrient-poor water at the surface. Until recently it has been assumed that they spend the day at greater depths and rise during the night toward the surface. It has been found that the deeper they go, the more they reduce their activity, apparently to reduce encounters with predators and to conserve energy. Later work suggested that swimming activity in krill varied with stomach fullness. Satiated animals that had been feeding at the surface swim less actively and therefor sink below the mixed layer. As they sink they produce faeces which may mean that they have an important role to play in the Antarctic carbon cycle. Krill with empty stomachs were found to swim more actively and thus head towards the surface. This implies that vertical migration may be a bi- or tri-daily occurrence. Some species form surface swarms during the day for feeding and reproductive purposes even though such behaviour is dangerous because <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> extremely vulnerable to predators. Dense swarms may elicit a feeding frenzy among fish, birds and mammal predators, especially near the surface. When disturbed, a swarm scatters, and some individuals have even been observed to moult instantaneously, leaving the exuvia behind as a decoy. [...] In 2012, Gandomi and Alavi presented {{what appears to be a}} successful stochastic algorithm for modelling the behaviour of krill swarms. The algorithm is based on three main factors: [...] " [...] (i) movement induced by the presence of other individuals (ii) foraging activity, and (iii) random diffusion." ...|$|E

6000|$|Second. There {{flows from}} this godly fear, watchfulness. As {{it is said}} of Solomon's servants, they [...] "watched about his bed, because of fear in the night," [...] {{so it may be}} said of them that have this godly fear--it makes them a watchful people. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> watch their hearts, and take heed to keep them with all diligence, lest they should, by one or another of its flights, lead them to do that which in itself is wicked (Prov 4:23; Heb 12:15). <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> watch, lest some temptation from hell should enter into their heart to the {{destroying}} of them (1 Peter 5:8). <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> watch their mouths, and keep them also, at sometimes, as with a bit and bridle, that they offend not with their tongue, knowing that the tongue is apt, being an evil member, soon to catch the fire of hell, to the defiling of the whole body (James 3:2-7). <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>them</b> watch over their ways, look well to their goings, and to make straight steps for their feet (Psa 39:1; Heb 12:13).
