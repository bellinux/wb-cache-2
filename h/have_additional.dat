5|$|In the Age of Sail, {{deception}} {{was often}} used by ships, and paint was applied ad hoc by ships' captains for temporary tactical advantage.

For example, {{in one of his}} battles during 1778–1782, American privateer Jonathan Haraden hid the guns of his ship the General Pickering, to appear {{as if it were a}} slow merchant ship. Haraden allowed his ship to be approached at close range by a much faster British privateer, then he quickly pulled the painted canvas away and delivered a full broadside, capturing the enemy.|$|E
