40|$|Abstract Currently, {{more and}} more Chinese {{tourists}} choose to have outbound tourism {{as a way to}} relax themselves from daily stressful work. The purchasing power of Chinese tourists is noticeable, so that they strongly boost local economy and promote the development of tourism industry. Consequently, an increasingly number of countries realize the great potential of Chinese tourists and take measures to attract Chinese tourists. Finnish government also make great efforts to attract more Chinese tourists, such as setting up more visa centers in China and strengthening the marketing of Finland from tourism perspective by launching many campaigns. Accordingly, this thesis is aimed to contribute to the branding of Finland as a destination to attract more Chinese tourists. The thesis has a very solid theoretical background. It is supported by numerous previous academic achievements and main schools of thoughts in its field, featured by relational network <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> model, image forming agents’ theory, framework of destination competitiveness. Many related concepts have been mentioned under the three main ideas, structured by <b>destination</b> <b>branding,</b> <b>destination</b> image, destination competitiveness. From this perspective, the thesis exhibits the comprehensive understanding of past literatures and paves the way to the empirical study. The study applies to in-depth interviews to collect data. The interviewee can be classified as two groups. One is from the actual tourists, the other is from practitioners who work in Finnish tourism bureau and are responsible with marketing Finland as the destination. The common findings are expected to generate in the aspect of Chinese tourists and Finland as a destination. Since this thesis is abductive by nature, a new model of <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> process is proposed to enrich the knowledge in this field. It acknowledges the great importance of Word- of-Mouth in the process of <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> and connects <b>destination</b> competitiveness with <b>destination</b> <b>branding.</b> Moreover, the study figures out how the <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> of Finland is conducted in China and examines the effect of current <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> channels.

In the beginning of the thesis, the idea of <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> will be explained in detail. The importance of the topic of this thesis will be explained by making the importance of <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> clear and by showing that there is a gap in the existing research of this area. The research question will also be presented. After this there will be a more thorough look into the existing research in the area. The term <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> will be defined and the role of <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> organizations will be explained. General theory of <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> will be discussed and examples of case studies of <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> of particular countries or areas will be presented. These case examples are especially helpful for this thesis, because a similar case study approach is also the basis of this study. After the literature review, the theoretical basis and the methodology will be explained. In the theoretical section, the framework which forms the basis of the analysis is presented, and in the methodology section the data that will be gathered and analyzed will be introduced. The principal data will consist of interviews and promotional materials of the destination marketing organizations of the two case countries, Italy and Spain. Interviews will be conducted with people interested in tourism, as well as a representative of ENIT, the destination marketing organization of Italy. The strategy of Turespaña, the Spanish destination marketing organization will also be analyzed based on their communicated strategy that can be found on their website. In the analysis section, the current tourism situation in the case countries and their current branding strategies will be explained. The results of the interviews will be analyzed. The most important themes to arise from these interviews will be presented and these themes will be looked for when analyzing the promotional materials of the destination marketing organizations. These themes were various things that were deemed important in the <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> process, like the use of unique as well as the most desired attributes as the basis of the brand image and the use of visuality in communicating the brand.

A mixed-methods approach was used to explore these issues. Firstly in-depth interviews were undertaken with <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> professionals to explore the distinct brand personalities that have been created for each resort. Secondly, interviews were undertaken with tourists in the three resorts to explore the congruence between the destination personality and the tourist’s self-concept. Effective <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> resulted in higher levels of congruence and more positive experiences among tourists (particularly an increased likelihood to make repeat visits and recommend the destination to others). Conversely where the resort’s brand personality was not congruent with visitors’ self-concept experiences were less positive and visitors were not as likely to recommend the resort.

40|$|This paper aims {{to provide}} a {{theoretical}} overview of the relevance and impact of stakeholder power in the collaborative process of <b>destination</b> <b>branding.</b> <b>Destination</b> <b>branding</b> {{is defined as the}} process used to develop a unique identity and personality that is different from all competitive destinations. The tourism literature shows consistency in considering the process of <b>branding</b> a <b>destination</b> as a collaborative effort. Collaboration in the context of <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> has been addressed under two different though complementary points of view such as creation of shared image of the destination and the inclusiveness of the process. The 2 ̆ 7 collective phenomenon 2 ̆ 7 of <b>destination</b> <b>branding,</b> has also been described as a highly complex and politicised activity that includes multiple stakeholders. The definition of tourism as an industry that involves multiple players allows studying the characteristics of the collaboration that occur among stakeholders within a tourism destination and, particularly, in the context of <b>destination</b> <b>branding.</b> Power appears intrinsically connected to the concept of collaboration. The existence of power within collaborative processes has been extensively examined. The complexity of the tourism system is enhanced by the consideration that there is no other industry in the economy that is linked to so many diverse and different kinds of product and services as is the tourism industry. These characteristics of tourism determine that in every decision making process, like the process of <b>branding</b> a tourism <b>destination,</b> a variety of different interest groups, operating at different levels tends to influence the outcomes of the process...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: There {{is a lack}} {{of theory}} {{relating}} to <b>destination</b> <b>brand</b> performance measurement in the destination branding literature, which emerged in the late 1990 s (see for example Dosen, Vransevic, & Prebezac, 1998). Additionally, there {{is a lack of}} research about the importance of travel context in consumers’ destination decision making (Hu & Ritchie, 1993). This study develops a structural model to measure <b>destination</b> <b>brand</b> performance across different travel situations. The theory of planned behaviour (TpB) was utilised as a framework to underpin the consumer-based brand equity (CBBE) hierarchy to develop a model of <b>destination</b> <b>brand</b> performance. Research approach: A proposed model of <b>destination</b> <b>brand</b> performance was developed through a review of the literature. The first study was used to identify destination image attributes (the core construct) using an analysis of the literature, a document analysis, and personal interviews using the Repertory Test qualitative technique. Underpinned by Personal Construct Theory (PCT), the Repertory Test enables the elicitation of attributes consumers use to evaluate destinations when considering travel. Data was examined in the first study to i) identify any attribute differences in travel contexts and ii) create a scale for use in a questionnaire. A second study was conducted to test the proposed model using a questionnaire with eight groups of participants to assess four destinations across two travel contexts. The model was tested utilising structural equation modelling. Findings: The first study resulted in a list of 29 destination image attributes for use in a scale index. Attributes were assessed across travel contexts and few differences were identified. The second study assessed the congruence of <b>destination</b> <b>brand</b> identity (the destination marketing organisation’s desired image) and <b>destination</b> <b>brand</b> image (the actual perceptions held by consumers) using importance-performance analyses. Finally, the proposed model of <b>destination</b> <b>brand</b> performance was tested. Overall the data supported the model of <b>destination</b> <b>brand</b> performance across travel contexts and destinations. Additionally, this was compared to consumers’ decision sets, further supporting the model. Value: This research provides a contribution to the destination marketing literature through the development of a measurement of <b>destination</b> <b>brand</b> performance underpinned by TpB. Practically; it will provide destination marketing organisations with a tool to track <b>destination</b> <b>brand</b> performance, relative to key competing places, over time.

The {{purpose of the}} study is to develop the con-cepts needed to describe and analyse the <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> process in the country context. Its focus is on the national tourism organisation. Today place branding, particu-larly its tourism-related sub-area of <b>destination</b> <b>branding,</b> is a common approach towards tourism destination promotion. The academic <b>destination</b> <b>branding</b> discourse however has been under-theorised. The theoretical basis of this study lies within multidisciplinary image, identity and branding research (especially corporate branding), drawing particularly from marketing and organisational research.
