40|$|<b>Ignition</b> <b>systems</b> are the {{fundamental}} parts of spark ignition engines which determine the engine efficiency and pollutant emission. With {{the recent developments}} in engine technology significantly high spark energies are required. This paper reviews progress in alternative <b>ignition</b> <b>systems</b> that supply high energy sparks and more efficiently transfer energy to the gas mixture. The improvement in performance parameter of a spark plug such as net heat transfer rate, flame development time, exhaust gas emission rate are compared with conventional <b>ignition</b> <b>systems.</b> This paper also tries to identify critical research gap and also the advantages and limitations of advanced systems {{with reference to the}} advanced researches reported in this area...|$|R
5|$|In {{testing the}} {{transmitter}} proved only barely suitable in the air-to-air role, with short detection ranges {{due to its}} relatively low power. But to everyone's surprise, {{it was able to}} easily pick out the wharves and cranes at the Harwich docks a few miles south of Bawdsey. Shipping appeared as well, but the team was unable to test this very well as the Heyford was forbidden to fly over water. After this success, Bowen was granted two Avro Anson patrol aircraft, K6260 and K8758, along with five pilots stationed at Martlesham to test this ship-detection role. Early tests demonstrated a problem with noise from the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> interfering with the receiver, but this was soon resolved by fitters at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE).|$|E

25|$|Maintenance of {{the eternal}} flame is an ongoing issue. Arlington National Cemetery experts said in 2001 that it cost about $200 a month to keep the flame burning. As of 2010, Fenwal Controls, a gas {{equipment}} manufacturer based in Boston, was the contractor responsible for maintaining the flame. The eternal flame's original, custom-manufactured <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> was contained in a weather-proof box buried {{a few feet from}} the grave site. The system controlled the flow of gas and oxygen to the flame and kept it lit via a high-voltage cable and 20,000-volt spark ignition electrode near the gas burner. No longer constantly sparking to keep the flame lit, the system monitored the flame and activated the <b>ignition</b> <b>system</b> only when the flame was extinguished. The electrode was specially designed for outdoor use. Oversight of the flame's maintenance was provided by the Army Corps of Engineers, which contracted with Fenwal Controls to ensure the eternal flame was maintained and upgraded as needed. According to Arlington National Cemetery historian Tom Sherlock, when the gas burner required maintenance the flame was shut off. But maintenance needs were so minimal that no living Fenwal Controls employee had seen the interior of the <b>ignition</b> <b>system.</b> An on-site visit was planned by Fenwal Controls for early 2010 to inspect the eternal flame and conduct a review of the ignition and burner systems.|$|E
