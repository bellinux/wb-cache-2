5000|$|By 1984, Pontiac was in {{the midst}} of a {{resurgence}} as the division began to reassert its 1960s role as GM's performance brand. The 6000STE (Special Touring Edition) was introduced for the 1983 model year. 5-passenger seating with front captain seats and power windows were standard on this trim level (optional on some other trim levels). It featured a High-Output version of the 6000's optional 2.8 L V6. Like that engine, it sported a 2-barrel carburetor, though it delivered 135 horsepower, rather than the usual 112 horsepower. Although intended to compete with similar entries from BMW and Audi, the 6000 used older technologies by comparison. The fuel system was carbureted (competitors had fuel injection) and gauge cluster lacked a tachometer. The 1984 6000STE featured a <b>digital</b> <b>gauge</b> cluster featuring a bar-graph tachometer. The STE featured a driver information center with a system which monitored functions such as lights, doors, tune-ups and tire rotations. For 1984, Road and Track called the 6000 STE one of the top twelve enthusiast cars.|$|E

40|$|Devices {{which offer}} simple, inexpensive, {{reliable}} and non-destructive objective measurement of fruit firmness {{assist in the}} monitoring of quality. For the present study, the Analogue CSIRO Tomato Firmness Meter (AFM), which measures fruit deformation under a 500 g load applied for 30 s was modified by replacing the analogue displacement gauge with a <b>digital</b> <b>gauge</b> and by using a laboratory jack for positioning the fruit in the vertical dimension. Non-destructive measurements of tomato fruit softening during ripening and determined with the Digital Firmness Meter (DFM) were strongly correlated with both firmness measured with the AFM (r(2) = 0. 96, n = 19) and with firmness determined subjectively by hand pressure (r(2) = 0. 93, n = 19). Similarly, mango fruit softening during ripening was monitored and DFM and hand firmness measurements were well correlated (r(2) = 0. 95, n = 10). The firmness of individual fruit could be measured around 20 % faster with the DFM than with the AFM, and displacement was easier to read from the digital than from the analogue display. The DFM {{proved to be a}} suitable device for measuring fruit firmness in postharvest laboratory studies and warrants evaluation under commercial packing and handling conditions...|$|E

30|$|Normal overjet {{was defined}} as between 0 and 2 mm (depending on tooth thickness), and we {{considered}} good overjet to range from 0.5 to 2 mm. In the vertical plane, the overbite was considered correct when the upper incisors covered the lower incisors by about 1.5 to 2.5 mm. In the transverse plane, the buccal cusps of the upper teeth were correctly positioned if they were outside the lower buccal cusps on both sides. The occlusal interpremolar and intermolar widths were measured with a <b>digital</b> <b>gauge</b> (DCA 150 B Velleman, Gavere, Belgium), respectively, as {{the distance of the}} palatal cusps of the first bicuspids and as the distance between the mesiolingual cusp tips of the second permanent molars. The arch dimensions were calculated using the appropriate templates based on the Ricketts pentamorphic arches, as suitably increased (+ 5 %, + 10 %, + 15 %) or reduced (− 5 %, − 10 %, − 15 %), starting from the original image[12]. In this way, we had six templates for each shape, which were laid on the dental casts until the best match was found. This analysis was performed by two operators (ASB, AU) at different times; when these operators did not agree, a third examination was performed by a third operator (ACB).|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} possible changes and/or device-related {{impairments in}} phonetic habits produced by rapid maxillary expansion (RME). Materials and Methods: Thirty-five patients scheduled for RME {{were divided into}} two groups: Group A (banded two-arm Hyrax) and Group B (banded four-arm Hyrax). Speech samples were collected at six time points, before, during and after RME removal. Acoustical analysis was performed using PRAAT and BioVoice analysis tools. Ten volunteers completed a questionnaire on the acceptability of patient's speech. Maxillary dimensions and palatal volume were measured on dental casts before and after expansion using a <b>digital</b> <b>gauge.</b> Results: Voice analysis showed an increase in the peak frequency of fricative consonants (/s/,/ʃ/) after expansion, whereas there was no change of formant frequencies of palatal consonants (/ɲ/,/ʎ/). Vowel /i/ displayed a lowering of the first formant frequency, and an increase {{in the second and third}} formant frequencies. After bonding, Group B showed both a greater reduction in the peak frequency of fricatives and a greater increase in the formant frequencies of palatal consonants than Group A. Conclusion: Rapid maxillary expansion causes a slight phonetic change in the acoustical parameters of both consonants and vowels. The two-arm Hyrax caused less speech impairment than the four-arm Hyrax during the treatment...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Recovery from stroke-related oro-facial {{impairment}} {{has rarely}} been investigated. In this longitudinal study chewing efficiency, maximum lip and bite force as well as masseter muscle thickness were evaluated and compared with hand-grip force. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty-one hospitalized stroke patients and 24 controls were recruited for this cohort study with 2 -year follow-up. Chewing efficiency was evaluated with a color mixing ability test, lip forces with a traction dynamometer, bite force with a <b>digital</b> <b>gauge,</b> masseter muscle thickness using ultrasound measurements and grip strength with a hand dynamometer. RESULTS: During the 2 -year observation period, patients were evaluated four times. A total of 21 patients {{dropped out of the}} study. Stroke patients showed significantly impaired chewing efficiency and lower lip forces than controls with no significant improvement over time. Bite forces were not different between ipsi- and contralesional sides, in contrast to contralesional hand-grip strength which was significantly impaired and did not improve during the observation period. On the first examination with a median of 40 days after stroke, masseter thickness was reduced contralesional, but did not continue to show significant side-differences during follow-up. CONCLUSIONS: Stroke affects the upper limb and the masseter muscles differently on a functional and morphological level. Further research is needed to evaluate the predictive value of oro-facial parameters on functional outcome after stroke. CLINICAL RELEVANCE: Impaired chewing efficiency and reduced lip force are quantifiable symptoms in stroke patients which seem not to improve in absence of oro-facial rehabilitation procedures...|$|E

40|$|BacKGROUND: {{the purpose}} of this study was to compare the results {{obtained}} using the rapid palate expander (rPe) and the quad-helix (QH) in the treatment of cleft lip and palate (clP) patients in mixed dentition. METHODS: in this retrospective clinical trial 28 clP patients in mixed dentition were enrolled and divided into a group rPe, consisting of 11 patients, and a group QH, consisting of 17 patients. Plaster models before and after treatment were scanned and measurements were made using the software ortho analyzerTM. Measurements, obtained with a <b>digital</b> <b>gauge</b> on plaster models, were regarded as the gold standard and compared with those on digital models. Measurement error was assessed using the Dahlberg formula and the reliability and accuracy of the measurements were evaluated by the interclass coef cient (ICC). The unpaired t-test was used to compare the group rPe with the group QH. RESULTS: Measurement error found with Dahlberg’s method was 0. 36. icc values indicated a strong repeatability of the evaluator’s measurements on digital models and an almost perfect repeatability on plaster models, with a value of 0. 79 and 0. 93, respectively. the icc for the accuracy of the measurements on digital models was equal to 0. 74, indicating a strong agreement with measurements realized on plaster models. Patients in the QH group presented a gain of the anterior palatal diameter signi cantly greater than those in the RPE group.
