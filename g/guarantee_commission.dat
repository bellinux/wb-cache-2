5000|$|By {{the next}} day, the PSOE had descended further into chaos, as both sides refused to {{recognize}} the other's legitimacy to act and clashed on the interpretation of party rules, with Sánchez barricading himself in the party's headquarters in Calle de Ferraz (Spanish for Ferraz street), Madrid, as his supporters accused dissenters of [...] "staging a coup". Critics proclaimed that they were now {{in control of the}} party, and Verónica Pérez, President of the federal committee and pupil of Susana Díaz, claimed herself to be [...] "the only authority that exists in the PSOE, whether supporters like it or not" [...] under party rules. Dissenters sought to convene the party's guarantees federal commission—an independent body tasked with resolving disputes within the party—to forcibly depose Sánchez, but Sánchez's supporters argued that they had no right to summon the <b>guarantees</b> <b>commission</b> and that their actions were [...] "void". Nonetheless, three of the five commission members demanded that the body be convened and accused Sánchez of [...] "preventing them from acting", stating they would issue a dictum themselves if the body was not convened within 24 hours.|$|R
5000|$|Attempts {{from both}} sides to reach some sort of {{compromise}} to prevent all out war from raging at the next day's federal committee failed, with the two factions' positions seemingly irreconcilable in the short term. Police intervention was required ahead of Saturday's meeting to deal with possible unrest between party members {{in the area around}} the Madrid headquarters as the interim leadership pleaded with party supporters for [...] "serenity" [...] and [...] "prudence" [...] to prevent the conflict from escalating further. After Sánchez chose not to convene the <b>guarantees</b> <b>commission</b> until after the federal committee, the three Sánchez critics on the commission issued a report endorsing the executive committee's dissolution and calling for the federal committee to fill the power vacuum. They also deemed that party rules did not provide for the [...] "interim" [...] status that Sánchez's executive had conferred upon itself, with any decision adopted in such circumstances being [...] "completely without any statutory validity and null and void". Pedro Sánchez immediately held a press conference—his first since the crisis started—and challenged dissenters to vote on the party's position on a future Rajoy investiture vote, promising to step down if the federal committee decided to support an abstention. However, Sánchez's critics were undeterred, retaining their plan to depose Sánchez in Saturday's meeting nonetheless.|$|R
2500|$|The {{participation}} of many artists, {{in addition to}} Metzinger, Gleizes and the Duchamp brothers, {{in the formation of}} the association Les Artistes de Passy in October 1912 was an attempt to transform the Passy district of Paris into yet another art-centre; a further sign of a growing emphasis on communal activity that would culminate in the Section d'Or exhibition. Les Artistes de Passy was a further sign too, as Robbins points out, of the growing rift that separated the Salon Cubists (Metzinger, Gleizes, Le Fauconnier, Delaunay, Léger and others) from the Gallery Cubists (Picasso and Braque). There was a distinct difference between the Salon Cubists and Kahnweiler’s Cubists. The latter had mostly been seen by a small group of artists and connoisseurs in a small private gallery, generating only modest reviews in the press, while the impact of the Salon group in the printed press and general public was enormous. Kahnweiler had exclusivity contracts with his artists and sold only to a small circle of collectors from his small [...] "boutique" [...] (Gleizes' term) comparatively hidden behind La Madeleine. Works of the Salon Cubists were seen by tens of thousands of spectators during well-publicized, conspicuous and prominent events such as the Salon d'Automne and Salon des Indépendants. Picasso and Barque were kept away from the Salons by Kahnweiler for fear of ridicule and for financial reasons (exclusivity <b>guaranteed</b> <b>commission).</b>|$|R
25|$|Contrary to a stockbroker, a {{professional}} who arranges transactions between a buyer and a seller, {{and gets a}} <b>guaranteed</b> <b>commission</b> for every deal executed, {{a professional}} trader may have a steep learning curve and his/her ultra-competitive performance based career may be cut short, especially during generalized stock market crashes. Stock market trading operations have a considerably high level of risk, uncertainty and complexity, especially for unwise and inexperienced stock traders/investors seeking {{an easy way to}} make money quickly. In addition, trading activities are not free. Stock speculators/investors face several costs such as commissions, taxes and fees to be paid for the brokerage and other services, like the buying/selling orders placed at the stock exchange. Depending on the nature of each national or state legislation involved, a large array of fiscal obligations must be respected, and taxes are charged by jurisdictions over those transactions, dividends and capital gains that fall within their scope. However, these fiscal obligations will vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. Among other reasons, there could be some instances where taxation is already incorporated into the stock price through the differing legislation that companies have to comply with in their respective jurisdictions; or that tax free stock market operations are useful to boost economic growth. Beyond these costs are the opportunity costs of money and time, currency risk, financial risk, and Internet, data and news agency services and electricity consumption expenses—all of which must be accounted for.|$|R

40|$|A {{letter report}} {{issued by the}} General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The military exchange services operate {{a wide range of}} retail activities, such as department stores, florist shops, barber and beauty shops, gas stations, and restaurants. Hamburger restaurants represent a major segment of the exchange services' name-brand, fast-food sales. The exchange services use either a direct or an indirect method to operate these restaurants. Under the direct method, the exchange service enters into a franchise agreement with a name-brand company to sell its product on a military installation. As the franchisee, the exchange service builds and operates the restaurant and directly employs and trains the personnel. In turn, the exchange service receives all of the revenues and profits and usually pays the company a licensing fee plus a percentage of the restaurant's sales. Under the indirect method, the exchange service contracts with a name-brand company that, in turn, builds the restaurant and either operates it as a company restaurant or provides a licensed operator. The company or its licensed operator hires, trains, and pays the restaurant personnel and usually pays annual fees and commissions to the exchange service on the basis of restaurant's sales. Under this agreement, the exchange service receives a percentage of the restaurant's annual sales; annual licensing fees; and, in some cases, a signing bonus or minimum <b>guaranteed</b> <b>commissions.</b> GAO's analysis of fiscal year 1998 and 1999 financial data from the Army and Air Force Exchange Service and the Navy Exchange Service Command showed that the indirect method of operating name-brand hamburger restaurants was more profitable than the direct method, regardless of the restaurants' sales volume, restaurant type (free-standing or part of a food court), or location. GAO's investment analysis projected that if new name-brand, hamburger restaurants were to be built, the indirect method would provide a greater return on investment over a 20 -year period. Other factors important in choosing between direct and indirect methods include financial and operating risks, customer service issues, employment opportunities for military dependents, and management control of a restaurant's operations. Although the Department of Defense's (DOD) policy on name-brand, fast-food restaurants establishes preferences for when the direct and indirect methods should be used, it does not provide enough guidance or criteria to determine which method to use or when it is appropriate to deviate from the policy. Also, DOD has not been actively involved in monitoring compliance with the policy. As a result, the exchanges have, over time, adopted operating philosophies and business models they believe best suit their particular circumstances. ...|$|R
30|$|According to the European Commission’s proposal, ‘the term “Youth Guarantee” refers here to {{the fact}} that young people [aged 15 – 24] receive a good-quality offer of employment, {{continued}} education, an apprenticeship or a traineeship. An offer of continued education could also encompass quality training programmes leading to a recognised vocational qualification’ (Council of the European Union 2013).

40|$|The {{multimillion dollar}} price {{guarantees}} that an auction house can offer for paintings {{have already had}} a large impact on auction house profits, and place new demands on the auctioneer's decision making and negotiating skills. Yet auctioneers have not been studied as independent entities and decision makers. To create a price guarantee, the auction house and the seller must negotiate both the guarantee amount and the extra commission the seller pays if the auction price exceeds the guarantee. We present a normative model of negotiations and find the frontier of <b>guarantee</b> and <b>commission</b> that is the Nash bargaining solution. We also determine the optimal reserve that the auctioneer should place on guaranteed property. We find that guarantees decrease the auction house's expected revenue compared to a conventional auction, but do allow it to attract business which might otherwise be lost. Guarantees benefit sellers, increasing the expected value and lowering the variance of their auction revenue. The auctioneer's optimal strategy depends {{not only on the}} distribution of the artwork's auction price, but also the price it will bring if it fails to sell at auction. In the latter case the auction house must pay the seller the guarantee and then sell the artwork, which it now owns, in a private secondary market where buyers regard the property as "damaged goods" and lower their offers. Although all points on the frontier produce equal expected revenue, several frequently used decision making rules suggest that both parties may prefer a guarantee arrangement where the seller pays no additional <b>commission</b> and the <b>guarantee</b> has the lowest value on the frontier. auctions, guarantees, negotiation, decision-making...|$|R

[...] "Since Hydro-Québec is already a major exporter to the United States, they would do nothing to jeopardize the agreements".

The central objective of EU merger control, as an important tool of EU competition policy and law, is to effectively prevent mergers from resulting in anticompetitive effects în the Internal Market. This article focuses on the main components of merger control system and the implications of enforcing the rules in this field for exploiting the full growth potential offered by the EU Internal Market, and for achieving the key goals of the Europe 2020 Strategy.

40|$|Over {{the past}} five decades of the Second Republic, Austria has {{advanced}} {{from one of the}} poorest among the industrialized European countries to one of the richest. While many observers agree that rapid economic growth was favored to a large extent by the system of social partnership, this judgment has always been difficult to support by economic theory; the only promising approaches were offered by game theory and decision making under uncertainty. Further theoretical considerations have been advanced more recently to capture the economic effects of social partnership. Among these are the (though more empirically oriented) debate about corporatism and the New Institutional Economics. The latter emphasizes the importance of the "rules of the game" for economic development. They comprise not only efficient legal institutions and regulations, but also the manifold informal guidelines which govern the economic process. This comprehensive network designed for the long perspective may not only lower the cost of economic transactions, but also reduce uncertainties and therefore stabilize expectations of economic agents. In this way, an explanation of economic growth is offered not only for the past (industrialization) and for different regions (developing countries), but also for growth differentials in highly advanced societies. A number of international studies showed social partnership to be among those institutions which may effectively boost the rate of growth of an economy. Highly centralized labor unions tend to pay more heed to macroeconomic realities and requirements when formulating their wage demands than smaller ones competing among each other. In this way, wage behavior may adjust timely and with little social cost to external shocks whereas otherwise it will often do so only under the pressure of higher unemployment. The existence of social partnership and its bodies (Parity <b>Commission)</b> <b>guarantees</b> that different economic interests will not lead to severe social conflicts – as is demonstrated by the fact that Austria, together with Switzerland, exhibits the lowest ratio of labor strikes among all industrialized countries. The stability which rests on the sustainability of these relations reduces the uncertainty for corporate management decisions and thereby exerts a positive effect on investment. In this context, foreign authors stress the important role of the Austrian Chambers; their strong position, based on compulsory membership, would allow them to {{go a long way in}} respecting macroeconomic concerns. Austria's access to the EU, while narrowing the scope for economic policy, should rather strengthen the role of social partnership: with the implementation of the European Monetary Union wage policy will become the single most important instrument remaining within the responsibility of national authorities to secure a country's international competitiveness.
