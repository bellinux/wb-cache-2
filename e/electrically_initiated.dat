40|$|Single {{skeletal}} muscle fibres from rat and cane toad were mechanically skinned and stimulated either <b>electrically</b> by <b>initiating</b> action potentials in the sealed transverse (t-) tubular system or by ion substitution causing depolarisation of the t-system to pre-determined levels. Depression of mitochondrial ATP-producing function with three diverse mitochondrial function antagonists (azide: 1 – 10 mm; oligomycin 1 μg ml− 1 and carbonyl cyanide 4 -trifluoromethoxyphenylhydrazone (FCCP) 1 μm), under {{conditions in which}} the cytosolic ATP was maintained high and constant, invariably reduced the excitability of rat fibres but had no obvious effect on the excitability of toad fibres, where mitochondria are less abundant and differently located. The reduction in excitability linked to mitochondria in rat fibres appears {{to be caused by}} depolarisation of the sealed t-system membrane. These observations suggest that mitochondria can regulate the functional state of mammalian muscle cells and have important implications for understanding how the balance between ATP utilisation and ATP production is regulated at the cellular level in general and in mammalian {{skeletal muscle}} fibres in particular...|$|R
40|$|Small {{quantity}} of energetic material coated {{on the inner}} wall of a polymer tube is proposed as a new method to generate micro-shock waves in the laboratory. These micro-shock waves have been harnessed to develop a novel method of delivering dry particle and liquid jet into the target. We have generated micro-shock waves {{with the help of}} reactive explosive compound high melting explosive (octahydro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetranitro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetrazocine) and traces of aluminium] coated polymer tube, utilising 9 J of energy. The detonation process is <b>initiated</b> <b>electrically</b> {{from one end of the}} tube, while the micro-shock wave followed by the products of detonation escape from the open end of the polymer tube. The energy available at the open end of the polymer tube is used to accelerate tungsten micro-particles coated on the other side of the diaphragm or force a liquid jet out of a small cavity filled with the liquid. The micro-particles deposited on a thin metal diaphragm (typically 100 -mu m thick) were accelerated to high velocity using micro-shock waves to penetrate the target. Tungsten particles of 0. 7 mu m diameter have been successfully delivered into agarose gel targets of various strengths (0. 6 - 1. 0 %). The device has been tested by delivering micro-particles into potato tuber and Arachis hypogaea Linnaeus (ground nut) stem tissue. Along similar lines, liquid jets of diameter 200 - 250 mu m (methylene blue, water and oils) have been successfully delivered into agarose gel targets of various strengths. Successful vaccination against murine salmonellosis was demonstrated as a biological application of this device. The penetration depths achieved in the experimental targets are very encouraging to develop a future device for biological and biomedical applications...|$|R
30|$|Electrospinning is {{a simple}} yet {{versatile}} technique for producing nanofibers. An <b>electrically</b> driven jet <b>initiating</b> from a polymeric solution through so-called Taylor cones can deposit a rich variety of polymers, composites, and ceramics with diameter ranging from tens of nanometers to few microns[12]. Previously, chitosan solutions blended with poly(ethylene oxide) (PEO) and poly(vinyl alcohol) (PVA) have been successfully electrospun[13] via a conventional electrospinning process. However, the chaotic nature of conventional electrospinning process will result in instability of the polymer jet and deposit nanofibers in a disordered and random fashion[14]. Continuous near-field electrospinning (NFES) was recently developed as a favorable technology due to its precise location control for nanofiber deposition and sophisticated patterns[15, 16]. Fundamentally, when the needle-to-collector distance implemented a significant reduction from several centimeters to few millimeters, the applied bias voltage {{can be reduced to}} few hundreds of volts. A recent application of direct-write, well-aligned chitosan-poly(ethylene oxide) nanofibers deposited via near-field electrospinning was carried out to exhibit excellent deposition of aligned nanofiber patterns[17]. Electrospun nanofiber-based scaffolding systems were found to be able to achieve good cell alignment[18, 19]. The cell interaction between the prescribed microscale patterns of nanofibers and macroscale specimen was experimentally observed with particular focus on cellular alignment and associated tissue architecture[20]. Furthermore, microfluidic synthesis of pure chitosan microfibers without any chemical additive for bio-artificial liver chip applications was proposed, and the chemical, mechanical, and diffusion properties of pure chitosan microfibers were analyzed[21]. Micropatterns of double-layered, multifunctional nanofiber scaffolds with dual functions of cell patterning and metabolite detection have been developed consisting of multiple layers of nanofiber scaffolds and nanofiber-incorporated poly(ethylene glycol) hydrogels[22]. Recent micro/nano technologies have opened up emerging interests to investigate relevant biological effects. For example, new nanomaterial-based assays are developed to quantitatively assess dose effect issues and related size dependence response[23]. Furthermore, under the action of rare earth oxide nanoparticle with respect to the nature of cytotoxin, cell proliferation and apoptosis are presented in[24]. In this paper, NFES was utilized to achieve direct-write and highly aligned chitosan nanofiber (CNF) with prescribed positioning density. The controlled and well-aligned CNFs are used to investigate cell spreading phenomena and related issues of cellular biocompatibility. The fundamental issues of cell spreading and extension guiding in a preferential direction are experimentally performed on parallel-aligned and grid patterns for the purpose of better realization of the ability to manipulate cellular architecture.|$|R

Reasonable estimates for the degrees of dissociation and vibrationnal excitation of H 2 at the exit of the discharge tubes are obtained from a two-dimensional computer analysis of the self-sustained discharge.

40|$|Further {{experimental}} evidence is presented {{indicating that the}} peripheral inhibitory phenomenon known as sensory adaptation, as it is manifested in tactile receptors in frogs' skin, is produced by a neurohumor released by non-nervous cells of the skin when they are pressed upon. 1. Adaptation is not produced by <b>electrically</b> <b>initiated</b> antidromic impulses backfired into the axon branches. 2. Intermittent air jet stimulation of a region of skin several millimeters distant from a responsive single ending produces failure of response of the ending to a similar direct intermittent stimulus applied to the skin containing the ending immediately afterward. 3. Constant pressure causes an ending to adapt but no spread of the effect, {{as described in the}} above paragraph, is found. This implies that the spread {{is the result of the}} vibratory movement of the skin. 4. The time curves of recovery from adaptation are inconsistent with any known properties of isolated nerve...|$|E

To achieve these objectives, particle velocities and frequencies of 38 and 35 blasts respectively were measured in three perpendicular directions for horizontal and vertical bench blasts respectively {{with the use of}} Instantel Blastmate II seismographs. In the blasts, Ammonium Nitrate (ANFO) (blasting agent) primed by a Gelatine Dynamite primer were <b>electrically</b> <b>initiated.</b> Scaled distance parameters (Maximum charge weight per delay and distance between blasting points to monitoring location) were also recorded. The extensively used equation for seismic low of propagation proposed by Devine (1962) and Devine and Duvall (1963) was used for the prediction of peak particle velocities. Points were plotted with Peak Particle Velocity (PPV) in Y- axis against Scaled Distance (D/Q 0. 5) in X- axis. Regression analysis was performed to define the line of best fit. At the end of statistical analysis, an empirical relationship with good correlation was established for prediction of peak particle velocity. Frequency analysis was also done for dominant frequency and Zero crossing frequency to identify the effect of frequency of ground vibration to structural damages and defining the most suitable type of frequency analysis to define the single frequency value for ground vibration.

40|$|To {{reduce the}} {{frequency}} of <b>electrically</b> <b>initiated,</b> 20 mm munition hangfires (delayed ignitions), a joint Army/NASA investigation was conducted to recommend quality evaluation improvements for acceptance of both primers and gun propellant. This effort focused only on evaluating ignition and combustion performance as potential causes of hangfires: poor electrical initiation of the primer, low output performance of the primer, low ignition sensitivity of the gun propellant, {{and the effects of}} cold temperature. The goal was to determine the "best" of the Army and NASA test methods to assess the functional performance of primers and gun propellants. The approach was to evaluate the performance of both high-quality and deliberately defective primers to challenge the sensitivity of test methods. In addition, the ignition sensitivity of different manufacturing batches of gun propellants was evaluated. The results of the investigation revealed that improvements can be made in functional evaluations that can assist in identifying and reducing ignition and performance variations. The "best" functional evaluation of primers and propellant is achieved through a combination of both Army and NASA test methods. Incorporating the recommendations offered in this report may provide for considerable savings in reducing the number of cartridge firings, while significantly lowering the rejection rate of primer, propellant and cartridge lots. The most probable causes for ignition and combustion-related hangfires were the lack of calcium silicide in the primer mix, a low output performance of primers, and finally, poor ignition sensitivity of gun propellant. Cold temperatures further reduce propellant ignition sensitivity, as well as reducing burn rate and chamber pressures...|$|E
40|$|A Study on Ground Vibration Due to Rock Blasting at Metal Quarry Ground vibration, {{air blast}} and fly-rock are {{unavoidable}} {{environmental impacts of}} rock blasting. Despite these, blasting is the widely accepted method of rock breaking in quarrying industry because of cost effectiveness, higher efficiency, convenience and ability to break hard rock.
