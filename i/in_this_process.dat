5|$|In an animal, {{cells are}} {{constantly}} dying. A balance between cell division and cell death keeps {{the number of}} cells relatively constant in adults. There are two different ways a cell can die: by necrosis or by apoptosis. In contrast to necrosis, which often results from disease or trauma, apoptosis—or programmed cell death—is a normal healthy function of cells. The body has to rid itself of millions of dead or dying cells every day, and phagocytes {{play a crucial role}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

5|$|Studies on {{embryogenesis}} {{and developmental}} biology. Mutants {{are created by}} adding transposons into their genomes, or specific genes are deleted by gene targeting. By studying the changes in development these changes produce, scientists aim to understand both how organisms normally develop, and what can go wrong <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>process.</b> These studies are particularly powerful since the basic controls of development, such as the homeobox genes, have similar functions in organisms as diverse as fruit flies and man.|$|E

40|$|Werner {{syndrome}} is a syndrome which accelerates the normal aging process of an individual. The Syndrome {{is caused by}} mutations in the WRN gene. The precise link between this mutated gene and the phenotype is still unclear but much science has been done. By making this report I got an overview on what this link could be. Because of the multifunctional nature of the WRN protein, and the time limit of this project, {{it was impossible to}} get a full overview on all the cellular processes that WRN may be a part of but I focused on two important processes that is; DNA replication and telomere maintains. It is widespread accepted that WRN protein plays a role <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>processes</b> and lack of efficiency <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>processes</b> can cause the aging phenotype. By making this report I have discovered that WRN protein plays a role in many processes and can be considered as being a helpprotein. That is; lack of the WRN protein makes unstable processes...|$|R

5|$|All known {{isotopes}} of curium are radioactive {{and have}} a small critical mass for a sustained nuclear chain reaction. They predominantly emit α-particles, and the heat released <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>process</b> {{can serve as a}} heat source in radioisotope thermoelectric generators, but this application is hindered by the scarcity, high cost, and radioactivity of curium isotopes. Curium is used in production of heavier actinides and of the 238Pu radionuclide for power sources in artificial pacemakers. It served as the α-source in the alpha particle X-ray spectrometers installed on several space probes, including the Sojourner, Spirit, Opportunity and Curiosity Mars rovers and the Philae lander on comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko, to analyze the composition and structure of the surface.|$|E
5|$|An {{alternative}} disposal method, transmutation, {{has been}} demonstrated at CERN for technetium-99. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>process,</b> the technetium (technetium-99 as a metal target) is bombarded with neutrons to form the short-lived technetium-100 (half-life = 16seconds) which decays by beta decay to ruthenium-100. If recovery of usable ruthenium is a goal, an extremely pure technetium target is needed; if small traces of the minor actinides such as americium and curium {{are present in the}} target, they are likely to undergo fission and form more fission products which increase the radioactivity of the irradiated target. The formation of ruthenium-106 (half-life 374days) from the 'fresh fission' is likely to increase the activity of the final ruthenium metal, which will then require a longer cooling time after irradiation before the ruthenium can be used.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the time}} of Bannockburn, however, Arundel's loyalty began to shift back towards the king. Edward's {{rapprochement}} towards the earl had in fact started earlier, when on 2 November 1313, the king pardoned Arundel's royal debts. The most significant factor <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>process</b> though, was the marriage alliance between Arundel and the king's new favourites, the Despensers. Hugh Despenser the Younger and his father Hugh Despenser the elder were gradually taking {{over control of the}} government, and using their power to enrich themselves. While this alienated most of the nobility, Arundel's situation was different. At some point in 1314–1315, his son Richard was betrothed to Isabel, daughter of Hugh Despenser the Younger. Now that he found himself back in royal favour, Arundel started receiving rewards in the form of official appointments. In 1317 he was appointed Warden of the Marches of Scotland, and in August 1318, he helped negotiate the Treaty of Leake, which temporarily reconciled the king with Thomas of Lancaster.|$|E
