[...] "If there's a better {{celluloid}} expression of ordinary American freedom than Ferris Bueller's Day Off, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> see it. If {{you could take}} one day and do absolutely anything, piling into a convertible with your best girl and your best friend and taking in a baseball game, an art museum, and a fine meal seems {{about as good as}} it gets," [...] wrote Hemingway.|$|E

500|$|James Van Hise in {{his book}} The Unauthorized Trek: The Complete Next Generation, said that the episode [...] "fascinated" [...] him due to the [...] "experimental" [...] nature. He praised the {{direction}} of Frakes, who saved it from being a series of [...] "potentially boring repetition", adding that he [...] "clearly has a firm grasp on the series." [...] Juliette Harrisson listed [...] "Cause and Effect" [...] as the seventh most groundbreaking episode of the series in 2012 for Den of Geek. Keith DeCandido reviewed the episode for Tor.com, giving it a rating of nine out of ten. He praised the means in which Frakes made each repetition different, and the writing by Braga which he described as a [...] "tour de force". He said that [...] "Cause and Effect" [...] had [...] "the best teaser {{in the history of}} Star Trek", and summed it up by saying [...] "This is an absolute triumph of craft from both Braga and Frakes, and just a fun episode, with the added bonus of Captain Frasier Crane at the end. I almost didn't need to rewatch this one, as it's one of my go-to episodes when I want to watch a Star Trek episode for the heck of it, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> tire of it." ...|$|E

500|$|The song's pop and sing-along {{sound and}} {{production}} received praise by critics. Greg Kot from the Chicago Tribune described the song's production as [...] "predictable" [...] and opined {{that the audience}} sing-along chorus sounded like it was created specifically for being performed during an arena encore. Similarly, Nathan S. of the website DJ Booth wrote that the song was suitable for [...] "ecstatic" [...] fans to sing along without efforts during a stadium concert: [...] "This {{is the kind of}} chorus that's going to be sung at full force in traffic jams for months to come, and while XO may be relatively more subdued, that call and response is destined to be a monster when performed live, right down to the way her voice shows a little wear, just like it would {{at the end of a}} show." [...] Jody Rosen writing for Vulture found a [...] "cavernous widescreen" [...] anthemic pop sound in the song further saying that its chorus sounded like it was specifically made for an Olympics opening ceremony. Carrie Battan of Pitchfork described the song as a [...] "stadium-filling" [...] one and classified it as one of Beyoncés [...] "decorous moments". Joe Lynch from Fuse described [...] "XO" [...] as the [...] "most uplifting" [...] pop song since Florence and the Machine's [...] "Shake It Out" [...] (2011). He praised the electronic flourishes, saying that they managed to [...] "keep the music from veering into banal territory" [...] and concluded that the song has a [...] "quirky" [...] sound previously unheard on other material by Beyoncé. Philip Sherburne of Spin found [...] "zero-G bounce... which, purely in terms of sonics, makes the most compelling argument for space tourism <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> come across".|$|E
