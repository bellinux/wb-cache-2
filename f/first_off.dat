25|$|Bairstow was {{a member}} of the England ODI squad for their match against Ireland in August 2011; however, he was not picked to play.

Playing as a specialist batsman, he scored an unbeaten 41 off just 21 balls to help England reach a Duckworth-Lewis adjusted total. His innings included three sixes, the <b>first</b> <b>off</b> just the fifth ball he faced, and he was named Man of the Match.|$|E

Sharpe's reports were complacently dismissive about the {{likelihood}} of their rivals having any success, {{and he said that}} once the 60-year-old Msiri was gone, Katanga would be theirs. In this case it would probably have become part of Northern Rhodesia, now Zambia, with which it shares strong cultural and ethnic links.|$|E
25|$|England’s bowlers {{worked hard}} {{throughout}} days 1 and 2, but {{were unable to}} replicate the successes they had previously achieved against India’s powerful batting line up. Dinesh Karthik continued his good form to score 91, and Rahul Dravid scored 55 before he was clean bowled by a good delivery from James Anderson. England’s cause was not helped by dropped catches from the wicketkeeper Matt Prior – <b>first</b> <b>off</b> Sachin Tendulkar {{when he was on}} 20, and then VVS Laxman when he was on 41. Tendulkar went on to make 82, and Laxman 51. Prior also conceded five lots of four byes on day 1, though some of these might conceivably have been signalled wide.|$|E
25|$|Conrad evidently {{intended}} {{to join his}} father, who held the castle of St Elias. He arrived <b>first</b> <b>off</b> Acre, which had recently fallen to Saladin (Ṣalāḥ ad-Dīn Yūsuf ibn Ayyūb), and so sailed north to Tyre, where he found {{the remnants of the}} Crusader army. After his victory at the Battle of Hattin over the army of Jerusalem, Saladin was on the march north, and had already captured Acre, Sidon, and Beirut. Raymond III of Tripoli and his stepsons, Reginald of Sidon and several other leading nobles who had escaped the battle had fled to Tyre, but most were anxious to return to their own territories to defend them. Raymond of Tripoli was in failing health, and died soon after he went home.|$|E

The trial ended with him being acquitted due to insufficient evidence. He stood trial in late 1968 with 113 defendants relating to the Mafia War that resulted in the Ciaculli massacre. However, what became known as Trial of the 114 ended with only ten convictions. The rest, including Leggio, were acquitted.|$|E
25|$|On 2 December 2006, at the Liberal Party {{leadership}} convention, Dion {{finished third}} {{after the first}} ballot, garnering 17.8% of the delegates. After the second ballot, Gerard Kennedy threw his support behind Dion. Earlier, the two leadership contenders had allegedly struck a pact in which the <b>first</b> <b>off</b> the ballot would throw his support to the other. Pundits said that this surprise move had caught the Ignatieff and Rae strategists off guard. When the totals of the third ballot were released, Dion held a narrow lead with 37%, followed closely by Michael Ignatieff with 34.5%. Bob Rae, with only 28.5%, freed his delegates, many of whom backed Dion, as did former leadership candidates Ken Dryden and Joe Volpe. On the fourth ballot, Dion captured 54.7% of votes cast and was declared the 11th leader of the Liberal Party of Canada.|$|E

25|$|The Premier League's {{top three}} kicked off {{simultaneously}} on 1 March. United were <b>first</b> <b>off</b> the mark, as Owen Hargreaves scored his first competitive goal in a Manchester United shirt {{to put the}} Reds 1–0 up against Fulham. Chelsea then went 3–0 up against West Ham {{in the space of}} five minutes, before Arsenal went 1–0 down to Aston Villa via a Philippe Senderos own goal. United were next to score, Park Ji-sung doubling their lead. Chelsea got a fourth goal in the 64th minute of their match, before a Simon Davies own goal stretched United's lead to three goals. However, just when it looked like United would be returning {{to the top of the}} table for the first time in a month, Arsenal snatched a late equaliser to remain a point clear at the top. With 10 games left in the season, United's goal difference seven goals better than Arsenal's, and Chelsea still only six points off the top two, this set up what was billed as one of the closest title races in recent years.|$|E
25|$|Mike Caldwell pitched {{his second}} win of the Series and almost went the distance. The Brewers struck first on Ted Simmons's bases loaded groundout in the <b>first</b> <b>off</b> of Bob Forsch, but the Cardinals tied {{the game in}} the third on Keith Hernandez's RBI double. The Brewers took a 2–1 lead in the bottom half on Cecil Cooper's groundout with runners on first and third and added to their lead on Paul Molitor's RBI single in the fifth. George Hendrick's RBI single in the seventh cut the Brewers lead to 3–2, but they got that run back {{in the bottom of the}} inning on Robin Yount's home run, then added to their lead in the eighth on {{back-to-back}} RBI singles by Charlie Moore and Jim Gantner off of Bruce Sutter. The Cardinals staged a late rally in the ninth as Keith Hernandez doubled in a run and George Hendrick singled him in with two outs. Bob McClure came in and allowed a single to Darrell Porter, putting the tying run on base. McClure, however, struck out Willie McGee, then retired pinch-hitter Gene Tenace to end the game. Robin Yount set a World Series record by recording his second four-hit game, his first came in Game 1. To this day, Yount remains the only player to have multiple 4-hit games in one World Series.|$|E

The game's early going {{was marked by}} defense as both teams struggled against the inclement weather. Virginia Tech scored <b>first</b> <b>off</b> a 43-yard touchdown scramble by quarterback Al Clark. Clark's touchdown provided the game's only points until the second quarter, when Alabama evened the score at 77 with a five-yard touchdown pass. The Hokies struck back with a field goal before halftime and took a tenuous 107 lead into the second half.|$|E

500|$|Far Side Virtual mainly designates a {{space in}} society, or a mode of behaving.

500|$|Both teams {{attempted}} {{to blame the}} other for allowing the violence {{to get out of}} hand. Soviet official Anatoly Kastriukov blamed a Canadian trainer for igniting hostilities by running over to the Soviet bench and punching one of their assistant coaches in the stomach. The Canadians, meanwhile, pointed to Davydov being the <b>first</b> <b>off</b> the bench as being the spark that led to the brawl. CBC commentator Don Cherry {{was one of the first}} to float a conspiracy theory that the Soviets had done so as a deliberate attempt to have Canada ejected, and therefore lose a medal. [...] Alan Eagleson suggested that the IIHF's decision would have been different had it been the Soviets in contention for a medal, and not the Canadians.|$|E
500|$|Chelsea {{survived the}} pressure, as Tevez failed {{to connect with}} a low cross from Rooney, and {{equalised}} {{in the final minute}} of the first half. The goal followed from a long-range shot by Michael Essien, which deflected <b>first</b> <b>off</b> Nemanja Vidić and then Ferdinand. The ball's change in direction caused Van der Sar to lose his footing, leaving Lampard, who had made a run from deep, with a simple finish. In celebration, Lampard looked up and pointed to the sky with both hands in memory of his mother, Pat, who had died a month earlier. At {{the end of the first}} half, Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson confronted match referee Ľuboš Micheľ, [...] "jabbing out an angry finger and spitting out a few choice words".|$|E
500|$|<b>First</b> <b>off,</b> Pausch {{explained}} {{his dream of}} being in zero gravity. As a child, {{this had been a}} dream inspired by Apollo 11, and had stayed with him as an adult. When he was the computer science professor at Carnegie Mellon, he learned of a program that NASA has that allows college students to go up into the air in NASA's Vomit Comet, which uses parabolic arcs to simulate the feeling of weightlessness. Faculty members were not allowed to go (Pausch called this a [...] "brick wall" [...] he faced), so he had to present himself as a web journalist, because local media was allowed on. Pausch proceeded to begin talking about his second childhood dream, playing in the National Football League. Although Pausch was never a player in the National Football League, he spoke about his childhood experiences with Pop Warner Football and how they had affected his life and taught him lessons. Pausch then moved on to his dream of publishing an article in the World Book Encyclopedia. As a child, Pausch always kept and read a World Book Encyclopedia in his home. As he progressed into a career, {{he became one of the}} leading professors in the field of virtual reality. World Book then called Pausch, interested in him writing for the encyclopedia. Currently, the article [...] "virtual reality" [...] in the World Book Encyclopedia is the one authored by Pausch.|$|E
