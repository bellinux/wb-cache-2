5|$|The CSF {{occupies}} the subarachnoid space (between the arachnoid mater and the pia mater) and the ventricular system around {{and inside the}} brain and spinal cord. <b>It</b> <b>fills</b> the ventricles of the brain, cisterns, and sulci, {{as well as the}} central canal of the spinal cord. There is also a connection from the subarachnoid space to the bony labyrinth of the inner ear via the perilymphatic duct where the perilymph is continuous with the cerebrospinal fluid.|$|E
5|$|The main {{character}} possesses several statistics, including hit points, power, and stamina, which can all increase upon gaining an experience level. Magic spells, which expend the character's MP, {{can be used}} to heal oneself or damage enemies. These spells can only be found in certain locations or obtained from other characters at specific plot intervals. In addition, the protagonist has a power gauge that affects his attack strength—the higher the gauge, the stronger his attack will be. The speed at which <b>it</b> <b>fills</b> is directly affected by the character's will level. The gauge will slowly fill up over time, but once the {{main character}} attacks, the gauge is emptied. When the gauge is completely filled up and the main character attacks with a weapon, he will perform a special attack.|$|E

25|$|But topological {{dimension}} {{is a very}} crude measure of the local size of a space (size near a point).

25|$|In astronomy, the {{interstellar}} medium (or ISM) is the gas and cosmic dust that pervade interstellar space: the matter that exists between the star systems within a galaxy. <b>It</b> <b>fills</b> interstellar space and blends smoothly into the surrounding intergalactic medium. The interstellar medium consists of an extremely dilute (by terrestrial standards) mixture of ions, atoms, molecules, larger dust grains, cosmic rays, and (galactic) magnetic fields.

25|$|Among the Platonic solids, {{either the}} dodecahedron or the {{icosahedron}} {{may be seen}} as the best approximation to the sphere. The icosahedron has the largest number of faces and the largest dihedral angle, it hugs its inscribed sphere the most tightly, and its surface area to volume ratio is closest to that of a sphere of the same size (i.e. either the same surface area or the same volume.) The dodecahedron, on the other hand, has the smallest angular defect, the largest vertex solid angle, and <b>it</b> <b>fills</b> out its circumscribed sphere the most.|$|E
25|$|In November 2014 the Briscoe Center for American History at the University of Texas {{announced}} that they had acquired all of Irving's literary and personal papers. The archive includes material from more than 50 years, from 1954 to 2012. Among the trove is Irving's correspondence with lawyers, publishers, colleagues and friends such as Graham Greene, Robert Graves and Irwin Shaw, his personal diaries and prison journals, many manuscript drafts, legal documents from lawsuits and from his 1972 bankruptcy, portions of his Howard Hughes manuscript and extensive handwritten notes and musings. <b>It</b> <b>fills</b> 20 boxes in the research center archive.|$|E

25|$|Other {{sports with}} loyal followings include snooker, which is popular with {{television}} companies as <b>it</b> <b>fills</b> swathes of their schedules {{at a very}} low cost, and also attracts good audiences. However, its popularity has waned somewhat since 1985, when {{nearly a third of}} the British population watched the conclusion of the celebrated Dennis Taylor versus Steve Davis World Championship final even though it ended after midnight. Darts is another British-centred sport with an assured place in the attention of the English sporting public. Lawn Bowls is popular, particularly with the elderly. International competitions are often televised.|$|E
25|$|A {{tailings}} dam is typically an earth-fill embankment dam used to store tailings, which are produced during mining operations after separating the valuable fraction from the uneconomic fraction of an ore. Conventional water retention dams can serve this purpose, {{but due to}} cost, a {{tailings dam}} is more viable. Unlike water retention dams, a tailings dam is raised in succession throughout {{the life of the}} particular mine. Typically, a base or starter dam is constructed, and as <b>it</b> <b>fills</b> with a mixture of tailings and water, it is raised. Material used to raise the dam can include the tailings (depending on their size) along with dirt.|$|E

There are many amateur leagues set up across the country, featuring team matches between snooker clubs.|$|E

25|$|The {{maintenance}} of the canal was {{a real problem for}} the descendants of Riquet. Despite many precautions, the canal silts up with silt from the water supply. In addition <b>it</b> <b>fills</b> with the branches and leaves of trees. Every winter, a period of closure allows the cleaning of the canal. It is necessary to re-dig the canal bed every year for two months. These works are expensive and two months is not always sufficient. Another problem is the invasion of the canal by weeds in the levels and spillways. There is no way to eradicate this scourge. In 1820 dredging was set up to pull up the weeds and the mud layer.|$|E
25|$|Summer Stories (also {{known as}} Christmas Crackers) is a webisode series {{broadcast}} during the 2016 Christmas period. <b>It</b> <b>fills</b> {{the gap between}} the show's 2 December finale and the start of the new season on 9 January 2017. The episodes are around one to two minutes in length and were released on Tenplay and the Neighbours UK Facebook page. The series follows five storylines, which focus on Ben Kirk (Felix Mallard) and Xanthe Canning's (Lily Van der Meer) relationship problems after her mother scammed his grandfather, Amy Williams's (Zoe Cramond) attempts at dating, Karl Kennedy (Alan Fletcher) receiving help from Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis) to cook the Christmas dinner, Piper Willis (Mavournee Hazel) and Tyler Brennan (Travis Burns) keeping their relationship a secret, while planning to be together on New Year's Eve, and finally Toadfish Rebecchi's (Ryan Moloney) reaction after learning that his wife Dee Bliss (Madeleine West) could be alive following her presumed death thirteen years ago. In a similar broadcast to the Royal Christmas Message in the UK, Sheila Canning (Colette Mann) addresses the nation and speaks about the year's events and the future.|$|E
