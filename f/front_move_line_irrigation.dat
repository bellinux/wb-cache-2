As the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>moved</b> eastward, {{so did the}} 48th Fighter Group: moving into Kelz Airfield (Y-32), Germany, on 26 March; Kassel-Rothwesten Airfield (R-12), Germany, on 17 April; and Illesheim Airfield (R-10), Germany, on 29 April.|$|R
50|$|In March 1918, after Lavr Kornilov's {{successful}} offensive, the Kuban Rada was re-established {{and placed}} itself under his authority. The Cossacks, formerly {{loyal to the}} Russian Empire, supported the White movement. Yet after the early successes of Kornilov's Volunteer Army, which rid the Kuban of the Bolsheviks, the <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> <b>moved</b> north into the Don territory.|$|R
50|$|The first air {{operation}} of the Whites during the war was flown over Lyly. It was a reconnaissance gathering mission as the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>moved</b> south. As the line neared Tampere, the AFB was moved first to Orivesi and then to Kaukajärvi near Tampere as well. The contribution of the White air force during the war was almost insignificant.|$|R
50|$|During the war {{all events}} at the stadium were {{suspended}} as the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>moved</b> across {{and away from the}} city. With the military actions moving farther east, the life in Kiev was more or less stabilized. During that time the stadium was unofficially called the Sport Palace Stadium. On July 12, 1942 the stadium was officially reopened as the All-Ukrainian Stadium.|$|R
50|$|In the 1991 Gulf War a mix {{of strikes}} by {{fixed-wing}} aircraft including carpet bombing and precision bombing was used in combination {{with large numbers of}} strikes by attack helicopters. During the ground assault phase tanks and other AFV's supported by attack aircraft swept over remaining forces. The <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>moved</b> forward at upwards of 40-50 km/h at the upper limit of the Army's tracked vehicles.|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the attack}} on 1 July, there were few mines blown during the Battle of the Somme. In {{the south of the}} battlefield, the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>moved</b> on from the mine systems. [...] In other areas, where the British had not gained much ground, schemes for new Russian saps were put in place by 3 July and the miners' sapping efforts {{intensified}} with the aim of quadrupling the number of Russian saps for future attacks.|$|R
2500|$|As the <b>front</b> <b>lines</b> <b>moved</b> eastward, the Einsatzgruppen, who {{followed}} close behind the fighting, moved through Latvia {{in a few}} weeks. [...] The German authorities then established [...] "resident" [...] SD offices in the major cities of Latvia, including Jelgava. [...] The other offices were in Daugavpils, Liepāja, and Valmiera, with the main office in Riga. [...] Under the Jelgava office, suboffices were set up in smaller towns in the vicinity, including Ilūkste, Jēkabpils, Bauska, and Tukums. [...] A Nazi official named Egon Haensell {{was in charge of}} the Jelgava SD office.|$|R
50|$|Unlike the {{permanent}} airfields {{built in the}} United Kingdom and designed for the strategic bombardment of Germany, the tactical combat airfields on the continent were temporary, often improvised airfields {{to be used by}} the tactical air forces to support the advancing ground armies engaged on the battlefield. Once the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>moved</b> out of range for the aircraft, the groups and squadrons moved up to newly built ALGs closer to the ground forces and left the ones in the rear for other support uses, or simply abandoned them.|$|R
500|$|The 60th (2/2nd London) Division took El Jib, Er Ram, and Rafat {{while the}} 53rd (Welsh) Division covered their left. The 74th (Yeomanry) Division {{captured}} Beitunia and the 10th (Irish) Division {{pushed to the}} east of Ain Arik. With Ottoman and German machine guns hard to locate amongst the boulders, the fighting was severe and stubborn. On 29 November the 60th (2/2nd London) and 74th (Yeomanry) Divisions were joined by the 53rd (Welsh) Division. A general British infantry advance on a [...] <b>front</b> <b>moved</b> their <b>front</b> <b>line</b> [...] on the right and [...] on the left. They pushed the whole line along the Nablus road to beyond Ramallah and Bireh by 30 December. Final objectives were gained and the line along the whole front secured.|$|R
50|$|After World War II broke out, the German {{occupant}} did {{not allow}} {{for the church to}} be opened and used for services. Towards the end of the War, bunkers and trenches were built nearby the church, however in 1945 the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>moved</b> and the church survived. In the post-war years and after changes in the political situation in Poland, the church was for a few years forgotten and neglected. There was even an idea that the church should be moved again, this time to a park in Pszczyna. However the opinion of the specialists was such that the technical state of the church building does not allow the church to be transported.|$|R
25|$|By Soviet estimates, in August 1941 about 231 {{detachments}} {{were operating}} already. Units formed and inserted into Belarus totaled 437 {{by the end}} of the 1941, comprising more than 7,200 personnel. However, as the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>moved</b> further away, conditions steadily worsened for the partisan units, as resources ran out, and there was no large-scale support from beyond the front until March 1942. One particular difficulty was the lack of radio communication, which was not addressed until April 1942. The partisan unit also lacked the support of local people. For several months, partisan units in Belarus were virtually left to their own devices; especially difficult was the winter of 1941-1942, with severe shortages in ammunition, medicine and supplies. The actions of partisans were generally uncoordinated.|$|R
2500|$|Lesbœufs (...) is {{a village}} on the D 74 between Gueudecourt and Morval, about [...] {{north-east}} of Amiens; Le Transloy lies to the north-west and Bapaume is to the north. French Territorials fought the II Bavarian Corps on the north bank of the Somme in late September 1914, after which the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>moved</b> west past Lesbœufs. Little military activity occurred round the village {{until the beginning of}} the Battle of the Somme, when German troops passed through the village in the first weeks of the battle. During the Battle of Flers–Courcelette [...] advances by the right flank corps of the British Fourth Army, brought the front line forward to the [...] trenches west of Lesbœufs but exhaustion prevented the British from reaching their third objective, a line east of Morval, Lesbœufs and Gueudecourt.|$|R
500|$|In the Second World War, the Western Desert Campaign {{began in}} Italian Libya. Warfare {{in the desert}} offered great scope for tacticians to use the large open spaces without the distractions of {{casualties}} among civilian populations. Tanks and armoured vehicles were able to travel large distances unimpeded and land mines were laid in large numbers. However the size and harshness of the terrain meant that all supplies needed to be brought in from great distances. The victors in a battle would advance and their supply chain would necessarily become longer, while the defeated army could retreat, regroup and resupply. For these reasons, the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>moved</b> {{back and forth through}} hundreds of kilometers as each side lost and regained momentum. [...] Its most easterly point was at El Alamein in Egypt, where the Allies decisively defeated the Axis forces in 1942.|$|R
50|$|Although World War I was {{the first}} war in which disease caused fewer deaths than combat, {{sanitary}} conditions in the trenches were quite poor, and common infections included dysentery, typhus, and cholera. Many soldiers suffered from parasites and related infections. Poor hygiene also led to fungal conditions, such as trench mouth and trench foot. Another common killer was exposure, since the temperature within a trench in the winter could easily fall below freezing. Burial of the dead was usually a luxury that neither side could easily afford. The bodies would lie in no man's land until the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>moved,</b> by which time the bodies were often unidentifiable. On some battlefields, such as at the Nek in Gallipoli, the bodies were not buried until after the war. On the Western Front, bodies continue to be found as fields are ploughed and building foundations dug.|$|R

5000|$|Fearing a long siege, General Gallieni {{did what}} he could {{to reduce the number}} of Parisians who needed to be fed; a dozen free trains were {{organized}} on 5 September to take Parisians to the French provinces. An emergency census ordered by Gallieni on September 8 showed that the population of Paris had dropped to 1,800,000, or only 63 percent of the population counted in 1911. By October, public transportation was again running in the city. The military government declared a moratorium on rents for those Parisians who had been summoned into the army and protected them from legal action until the end of the war. As of December 20, pedestrians could walk freely in Paris once again, but vehicles were only allowed to enter and leave Paris by fourteen of the fifty-five city gates that were open from five in the morning until ten at night. The government returned to Paris on December 11, and President Poincaré was again able to meet with his Council of Ministers in the Élysée Palace.

This movement, combined with the advance of a southern column of the 18th Volksgrenadiers through Grosslangenfeld to meet the 62nd at Winterspelt and combine for a capture of Steinebruck, with its bridge over the Our River. The capture of Schoenberg, (six miles east of St. Vith), also with a bridge over the Our, and Steinebruck would set up LXVI Corps for an envelopment of St. Vith itself. The only significant check in the German advance was at Kobscheid, where the 18th Cavalry Reconnaissance Squadron had circled the village with barbed wire and dug in machine guns from their armored cars. Here, they held the village for the day; after dark, they destroyed their vehicles and abandoned their positions, withdrawing to St. Vith. In the other villages, the cavalry troops were forced to withdraw {{earlier in the day}} so as to avoid being surrounded and cut off. The Squadron was directed by Colonel Devine to take-up positions on a new defense line along the ridge running from Manderfeld to Andler, {{on the north side of}} the Our River.|$|R
5000|$|This {{refusal to}} sell land and an attempt {{to set up an}} {{independent}} Kingitanga state was seen as rebellion by the government and was the primary cause of the New Zealand Wars in the 1860s, when the Taranaki and Waikato regions were scenes of conflict between the New Zealand government supported by British troops, colonial troops, local militia and loyal (kupapa) Maori fighting against the rebelling Kingite Maori [...] On their defeat in 1864 the Māori rebels forfeited some of their land. 3% of New Zealand's land was taken, although large areas of this were reserved for Maori and some of the land was never surveyed or occupied and subsequently returned to Maori. Defeat of the rebels was aided by the large flotilla of vessels brought to New Zealand by General Cameron in 1863 to operate in the Waikato River. The flotilla comprised shallow draught boats, including gunboats and barges for transporting troops and supplies, as the <b>front</b> <b>line</b> <b>moved</b> progressively south. Many of these vessels were sourced from Australia and captained by experienced Australian officers. Cameron also opened a second maritime link by bringing troops and supplies over the Raglan bar and building a redoubt at Raglan. Troops were marched over an old Maori trail that was widened by the Forest Rangers to allow access to the area north of Pirongia.|$|R
