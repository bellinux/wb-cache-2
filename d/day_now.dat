5|$|Prior to 1888, 26 January {{was very}} much a New South Wales affair, as each of the colonies had their own commemorations for their founding. In Tasmania, Regatta Day {{occurred}} initially in December to mark the anniversary of the landing of Abel Tasman. South Australia celebrated Proclamation Day on 28 December. Western Australia had their own Foundation <b>Day</b> (<b>now</b> Western Australia Day) on 1 June.|$|E
5|$|As Soviet troops {{approached}} Auschwitz in January 1945, most of {{its population}} was sent west on a death march. The prisoners remaining at the camp were liberated on 27 January 1945, a <b>day</b> <b>now</b> commemorated as International Holocaust Remembrance Day. In the following decades, survivors, such as Primo Levi, Viktor Frankl, and Elie Wiesel, wrote memoirs of their experiences in Auschwitz, and the camp became a dominant symbol of the Holocaust. In 1947, Poland founded the Auschwitz-Birkenau State Museum {{on the site of}} Auschwitz I and II, and in 1979, it was named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO.|$|E
5|$|Late on October23, Alpha made {{landfall}} in Hispaniola, quickly decreasing {{in intensity}} {{as it did}} so. After making landfall, the storm weakened, leaving it just between tropical storm and tropical depression status. Because of the weakening, and the strong southerly flow from nearby Hurricane Wilma, {{it was hard to}} determine whether a low-level circulation was present. However, satellite imagery suggested that a new center had developed over open waters to the north of Hispaniola. It was downgraded to a tropical depression early the next <b>day,</b> <b>now</b> re-emerging over open waters. The storm soon developed an elongated center of circulation which indicated that the system was weakening. On October24 the low-level center had completely dissolved, and only a small area of convective activity persisted. Thus the system had dissipated, and was a remnant low pressure system when the National Hurricane Center issued their last advisories of Alpha. Shortly thereafter, the remnant low was absorbed into the circulation of Hurricane Wilma on October25.|$|E

5|$|The {{song was}} covered {{several times in}} 1965, {{including}} a version by The Turtles on their album It Ain't Me Babe and a version by The Walker Brothers on their album Take It Easy with The Walker Brothers. Los Angeles band The Leaves covered the song on their 1966 album Hey Joe and Joan Baez included it on her 1968 album of Dylan covers Any <b>Day</b> <b>Now.</b> A version by singer/songwriter Turley Richards became a minor hit in 1970 (US #84). It was also covered in 1993 by Judy Collins on Judy Collins Sings Dylan... Just Like a Woman. Eric Clapton covered the song on during Bob Dylan's 30th Anniversary Concert Celebration. Other musicians who have covered the song include Fleetwood Mac, Rod Stewart, Jackson Browne, Ricky Nelson, Buck Owens, Bridget St. John, Eliza Gilkyson, and Les Fradkin.|$|E

25|$|Bullock and Star's {{hardware}} store in Deadwood burned down in 1894.

25|$|Brothers Nelson Bunker Hunt and William Herbert Hunt {{attempted}} to corner the world silver {{markets in the}} late 1970s and early 1980s, at one stage holding the rights to {{more than half of}} the world's deliverable silver. During the Hunts' accumulation of the precious metal, silver prices rose from $11 an ounce in September 1979 to nearly $50 an ounce in January 1980. Silver prices ultimately collapsed to below $11 an ounce two months later, much of the fall occurring on a single <b>day</b> <b>now</b> known as Silver Thursday, due to changes made to exchange rules regarding the purchase of commodities on margin.|$|E

His painting Diamond Lake 1969, 108 x 168inches, was acquired from Philip Johnson by the Museum of Modern Art in 1972 and was installed {{in the lobby of}} MoMA for several months. His painting Elijah 1969, 108 x 55inches was later exhibited in Beijing, China in the early 1990s; and it is currently on view in Havana, Cuba.|$|E

25|$|The town of Apex was {{incorporated}} in 1873, {{named for its}} location as the highest point on {{a portion of the}} Chatham Railroad which ultimately extends between Richmond, Virginia and Jacksonville, Florida. Apex grew slowly through the succeeding decades, despite several devastating fires, including a June 12, 1911 conflagration which destroyed most of the downtown business district. The town center was rebuilt and stands to this <b>day,</b> <b>now</b> one of the most intact railroad towns in the state. At the heart of town stands the Apex Union Depot, originally a passenger station for the Seaboard Air Line Railroad and later home to the locally supported Apex Community Library. The depot now houses the Apex Chamber of Commerce.|$|E

She made three more round-trips to the Pacific to return troops: to Okinawa in December 1945, to the Philippines in April 1946, and to China in July. When Talladega {{returned to}} San Francisco in July, she began preparations for inactivation and assignment to the Reserve Fleet. She was placed out of commission, in reserve, on 27 December 1946, at the Pacific Reserve Fleet, San Francisco Group.|$|E
