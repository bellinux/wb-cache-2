25|$|Phaedrus {{believes}} {{that one of}} the greatest goods given is the relationship between lover and boy. This relationship brings guidance and love into the boy’s life. Because the boy has a lover as such a valuable role model, he is on his best behavior to not get caught in something shameful. To get caught in something shameful would be like letting down his lover, therefore the boy is consistently acting his best. The absence of shame makes room <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of pride to come in; pride from the wealthy feeling of impressing one's own lover. Impressing one's own lover brings more learning and guidance into the boy's life.|$|E

Serventy, a scientist with the CSIRO, was the principal writer of the review report and he addressed both the need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of what the RAOU should be doing, and the structure that would allow it to do so. Although there was considerable vocal opposition to the reform proposals (including cutting the number of people on Council from an unwieldy forty to just nine) the report was ratified by Council in April 1969 and adopted at an Extraordinary General Meeting in June 1969, with the vote being over 80% in favour. Later that year came the first issue of the RAOU Newsletter, a publication that would evolve to become the magazine Wingspan.|$|E
25|$|The storm which {{dominates the}} opening chorus is portrayed vividly by the orchestra. Rapidly {{changing}} sixteenth notes {{played by the}} lower strings and woodwinds create {{an image of a}} turbulent sea while rising and descending scales in the upper woodwinds represent the unpredictable patterns of the wind in the tempest. Frequent interjections from the brass and percussion portray the bolts of lightning and thunder which accompany the storm. Otello's first entrance is marked by brass instruments <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of grandeur. Verdi adds to the anxiety by having the organ hold its three lowest notes in a cluster (C–C–D) through the entire scene. At the end, the woodwinds gradually calm down to portray the fading of the storm, and finally the release of the low organ discord completes the feeling of relief. When the chorus sings of their joy, the high woodwinds now portray the sparkling, cheerful flames.|$|E

He likens Erhard's relationship to his staff members {{to the way in which}} a guru interacts with disciples: [...] " [...] the essentially eastern phenomenon of a powerful being [...] (usually a guru or a spiritual teacher) attracting other powerful beings who nevertheless choose to channel their power through their leader."

500|$|Throughout {{the later}} part of American history, and into modern times, the {{relationship}} between American and European music has been a discussed topic among scholars of American music. Some have urged for the adoption of more purely European techniques and styles, which are sometimes perceived as more refined or elegant, while others have pushed <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of musical nationalism that celebrates distinctively American styles. Modern classical music scholar John Warthen Struble has contrasted American and European, concluding that {{the music of the}} United States is inherently distinct because the United States has not had centuries of musical evolution as a nation. Instead, the music of the United States is that of dozens or hundreds of indigenous and immigrant groups, all of which developed largely in regional isolation until the American Civil War, when people from across the country were brought together in army units, trading musical styles and practices. Struble deemed the ballads of the Civil War [...] "the first American folk music with discernible features that can be considered unique to America: the first 'American' sounding music, as distinct from any regional style derived from another country." ...|$|E

2500|$|Huxley's humanism {{came from}} his {{appreciation}} that mankind {{was in charge of}} its own destiny (at least in principle), and this raised the need <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of direction and a system of ethics. His grandfather T. H. Huxley, when faced with similar problems, had promoted agnosticism, but Julian chose humanism as being more directed to supplying a basis for ethics. Julian's thinking went along these lines: [...] "The critical point in the evolution of man… was when he acquired the use of … Man's development is potentially open… He has developed a new method of evolution: the transmission of organized experience by way of tradition, which… largely overrides the automatic process of natural selection as the agent of change". Both Huxley and his grandfather gave Romanes Lectures on the possible connection between evolution and ethics. (see evolutionary ethics) [...] Huxley's views on god could be described as being that of an agnostic atheist.|$|E

[...] when she sees her baby playfully peeking out from behind his hands. If the mother never responded playfully, sooner or later the baby would stop trying to elicit play from her. [...] Indeed, Winnicott came to consider that [...] "Playing takes place in the potential space between the baby and the mother-figure....he initiation of playing is associated with the life experience of the baby who has come to trust the mother figure". [...] "Potential space" [...] was Winnicott's term <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>sense</b> of an inviting and safe interpersonal field in which one can be spontaneously playful while at the same time connected to others (again a concept that has been extrapolated to the practice of analysis).|$|E
