It has no special funds, and is supported from resources and grants of participating organizations, when <b>informal</b> <b>working</b> <b>groups</b> are created. Totally we studied 1900 + variable stars of different types. The characteristic timescale is from seconds to decades and (extrapolating) even more. The monitoring of the first star of our sample AM Her was initiated by Prof. V. P. Tsesevich (1907 - 1983). Since more than 358 ADS papers were published. Some highlights of our photometric and photo-polarimetric monitoring and mathematical modelling of interacting binary stars of different types are presented: classical, asynchronous, intermediate polars and magnetic dwarf novae (DO Dra) with 25 timescales corresponding to different physical mechanisms and their combinations (part "Polar"); negative and positive superhumpers in nova-like and many dwarf novae stars ("Superhumper"); eclipsing "non-magnetic" cataclysmic variables; symbiotic systems ("Symbiosis"); super-soft sources (SSS, QR And); spotted (and not spotted) eclipsing variables with (and without) evidence for a current mass transfer ("Eclipser") with a special emphasis on systems with a direct impact of the stream into the gainer star's atmosphere, or V 361 Lyr-type stars. Other parts of the ILA project are "Stellar Bell" (interesting pulsating variables of different types and periods - M, SR, RV Tau, RR Lyr, Delta Sct) and "Novice"(="New Variable") discoveries and classification with a subsequent monitoring for searching and studying possible multiple components of variability.

Ich untersuche die verschiedenen Kriterien, die nach Ansicht der Herausgeber für eine Etablierung von "persönlichen Beziehungen" als einer gemeinsamen Strukturform sprechen, ergänze diese aber um weitere Aspekte. Ich gehe zudem der Frage nach, worin sich diese Formen persönlicher Beziehungen von anderen sozialen Beziehungen unterscheiden und werfe die Frage auf, ob diese Unterschiede alleine, wie in dem Handbuch unterstellt, auf dem Wege eines a-historischen, systematischen Vergleichs von sozialen Beziehungen rekonstruiert werden können. This review essay {{discusses}} the question {{raised by the}} handbook "Personal Relations": whether {{and to what extent}} personal relations can be understood as a fundamental sociological category, one that is uniform and covers social relations such as pair relationships, brother-sister and parent-child relationships, family relations, friendships, neighbourhoods or <b>informal</b> <b>working</b> <b>groups.</b> It examines the different criteria which—according to the publishers—plead for establishing personal relations as a joint structural form.

40|$|Abstract Background Decades of {{improper}} {{disposal of}} uranium-mining wastes on the Navajo Nation {{has resulted in}} adverse human and ecological health impacts as well as socio-cultural problems. As the Navajo people become increasingly aware of the contamination problems, {{there is a need}} to develop a risk-communication strategy to properly inform tribal members of the extent and severity of the health risks. To be most effective, this strategy needs to blend accepted risk-communication techniques with Navajo perspectives such that the strategy can be used at the community level to inform culturally- and toxicologically-relevant decisions about land and water use as well as mine-waste remediation. Objective The objective of this study was to develop GIS-based thematic maps as communication tools to clearly identify high risk exposure areas and offer alternatives to minimize public and ecological health impacts. Methods Thematic maps were produced that incorporated data derived from environmental sampling and public health surveys. The maps show the location and quality of unregulated water resources and identify regulated water sources that could be used as alternatives. In addition, the maps show the location of contaminated soil and sediment areas in which disturbance of surface deposits should be avoided. Preliminary feedback was collected from an <b>informal</b> Navajo <b>working</b> <b>group</b> to assess the clarity and efficacy of this proposed communication method. Results The <b>working</b> <b>group</b> found the maps to be both clear and effective, and made suggestions for improvements, such as the addition of more map features. The <b>working</b> <b>group</b> predicted that once the maps are presented to the public, water hauling and soil use behaviors will change, and dialogue with chapter officials will be initiated to accelerate further risk reduction efforts. Implications Because risk communication is complicated by language barriers, lack of infrastructure, and historical mistrust of non-Navajo researchers, mapping provides an easily interpretable medium that can be objectively viewed by community members and decision makers to evaluate activities that affect toxicant exposures. </p...|$|R
