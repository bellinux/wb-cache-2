The vacuum jacketed lines for the Ares I mobile launch platform were to be a combined 2000 feet long, with 60 + pipe sections and field joint cans.

The main reasons of the abnormal vibration in the outlet <b>piping</b> <b>system</b> were investigated by developing an acoustic model to simulate the gas pulsation and establishing two finite element models to conduct the mechanical vibration analyses. The acoustic analysis {{results showed that the}} pulsation amplitudes of most nodes in the outlet <b>piping</b> <b>system</b> exceeded the allowable values. The results of mechanical vibration analyses indicated that the insufficient stiffness of the outlet <b>piping</b> <b>system</b> and the first-order structure resonance occurred on thermowells were also the key factors inducing vibration. Several methods were put forward to attenuate vibration amplitude of the outlet <b>piping</b> <b>system</b> as well as the thermowells. A new pulsation attenuator was installed and the piping layout was rearranged to reduce pulsation amplitudes and shaking forces of all nodes in the outlet <b>piping</b> <b>system.</b> Several reasonable supports were added to improve the stiffness of the outlet <b>piping</b> <b>system.</b> After reinforcing the thermowells, the first-order natural frequency of the thermowells increased from 207. 4 Hz to 280. 7 Hz, away from the excitation frequency of 196. 67 Hz.

In a hospital, for example, the <b>piping</b> <b>system</b> supplies elements essential for hospital operations, such as water and fire-suppression foam. Such nonstructural components, especially <b>piping</b> <b>systems</b> and their subcomponents, must remain operational and functional during earthquake-induced fires. But the behavior of <b>piping</b> <b>systems</b> as subjected to seismic ground motions is very complex, owing particularly to the nonlinearity affected by the existence of many connections such as T-joints and elbows. The present study carried out a probabilistic risk assessment on a hospital fire-protection <b>piping</b> <b>system’s</b> acceleration-sensitive 2 -inch T-joint sprinkler components under seismic ground motions. Specifically, the system’s seismic capacity, using an experimental-test-based nonlinear finite element (FE) model, was evaluated for the probability of failure under different earthquake-fault mechanisms including normal fault, reverse fault, strike-slip fault, and near-source ground motions. It was observed that the probabilistic failure of the T-joint of the fire-protection <b>piping</b> <b>system</b> varied significantly according to the fault mechanisms.

40|$|Renovation {{of plant}} {{equipment}} of petroleum refineries or chemical factories {{have recently been}} frequent, {{and the demand for}} 3 D asbuilt modelling of <b>piping</b> <b>systems</b> is increasing rapidly. Terrestrial laser scanners are used very often in the measurement for as-built modelling. However, the tangled structures of the <b>piping</b> <b>systems</b> results in complex occluded areas, and these areas must be captured from different scanner positions. For efficient and exhaustive measurement of the <b>piping</b> <b>system,</b> the scanner should be placed at optimum positions where the occluded parts of the <b>piping</b> <b>system</b> are captured as much as possible in less scans. However, this "nextbest" scanner positions are usually determined by experienced operators, and {{there is no guarantee that}} these positions fulfil the optimum condition. Therefore, this paper proposes a computer-aided method of the optimal sequential view planning for object recognition in plant <b>piping</b> <b>systems</b> using a terrestrial laser scanner. In the method, a sequence of next-best positions of a terrestrial laser scanner specialized for as-built modelling of <b>piping</b> <b>systems</b> can be found without any a priori information of piping objects.
