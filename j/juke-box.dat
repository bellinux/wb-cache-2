40|$|Abstract Operator {{mistakes}} {{are a significant}} source of unavailabil-ity in modern Internet services. In this paper, we first characterize these mistakes by performing an extensiveset of experiments using human operators and a realistic three-tier auction service. The mistakes we observedrange from software misconfiguration, to fault misdiagnosis, to incorrect software restarts. We next proposeto validate operator actions before they are made visible {{to the rest of the}} system. We demonstrate how toaccomplish this task via the creation of a validation environment that is an extension of the online system, wherecomponents can be validated using real workloads before they are migrated into the running service. We show thatour prototype validation system can detect 66 % of the operator mistakes that we have observed. 1 Introduction Online services, such as search engines, e-mail, work-group calendars, and music <b>juke-boxes</b> are rapidly becoming the supporting infrastructure for numerous users'work and leisure. Increasingly, these services are comprised of complex conglomerates of distributed hardwareand software components, including front-end devices, numerous kinds of application packages, authenticators,loggers, databases, and storage servers...|$|R

50|$|American firm of {{instrument}} {{makers and}} dealers. Started in Cincinnati in 1853 by Franz Rudolph Wurlitzer (1831-1914) {{who was a}} German immigrant from the musical instrument making region of Markneukirchen in Saxony, the company was directed successively by his three sons until 1941, when it moved to Chicago. From importing musical instruments it turned in the 1880s to marketing automated instruments, including disc-changer machines and coin-operated pianos; the ‘Mighty Wurlitzer’ theatre organ was introduced in 1910, followed by the successful coin-operated phonograph, or <b>juke-box</b> (1934-74). In 1909 the company began making harps; they were far more durable than European prototypes, and from 1924 to the 1930s eight acclaimed models were available. The firm's violin department, independently directed by Rembert Wurlitzer (1904-63) from 1949, became a leading international centre for rare string instruments. Among Wurlitzer's electronic instruments, beginning with electric reed organs in 1947, the most important have been the fully electronic organs, especially the two-manual-and-pedals ‘spinet’ type (from 1971 with synthesizer features) for domestic use.|$|E

5000|$|The genre {{began in}} the fifties, and had its peak of {{production}} in the sixties; according to film critic Stefano Della Casa the name [...] "musicarello" [...] is {{a reference to the}} successful Carosello. The film which started the genre is considered to be I ragazzi del <b>Juke-Box</b> by Lucio Fulci. At the heart of the musicarello is a hit song, or a song that the producers hoped would become a hit, that usually shares its title with the film itself and sometimes has lyrics depicting a part of the plot. Unlike most film musicals, this subgenre has an evident age-based focus: while musical films had until that time had been produced in a way generally undifferentiated for tastes and ages, musicarello is explicitly targeted to a youthful audience and usually has in its plot a vague polemic against conformism and bourgeois attitudes. The genre was referred as a curious mix between fotoromanzi, traditional comedy, hit songs and tentative references to tensions between generations. The key figures in this genre were directors Piero Vivarelli and Ettore Maria Fizzarotti, and actor-singers Gianni Morandi, Little Tony, Rita Pavone and Caterina Caselli.|$|E

Introduction: Artefacts and Tradition Remembering our past, comparing events that happened years or decades ago, recalling a particular perspective of our contemporary history and connecting events one with the other – that is what we do when we go to museums, to libraries, to cinema retrospectives or when we look for books or other cultural and media artefacts that connect present and past.
