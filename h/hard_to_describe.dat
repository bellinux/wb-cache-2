However, the fact remains that Zevi is the most famous Jew to have become a Muslim, which is also what the term Sabbatean has come to denote. Many within Zevi's inner circle followed him into Islam, including his wife Sarah and most of his closest relatives and friends. Nathan of Gaza, the scholar closest to Zevi, who had caused Zevi to reveal his Messiahship and in turn became his prophet, never followed his master into Islam but remained a Jew, albeit excommunicated by his Jewish brethren.|$|E

As a companion to his memoir, he issued an 8×CD box set, A – Z Recordings, with live performances from his A – Z Tours from 2004 to 2010. The 105 tracks are listed alphabetically, and were typically performed over four nights. The set includes a booklet of photographs. The related audio book on 16×CDs has Kelly joined by Australian actors, Cate Blanchett, Russell Crowe, Judy Davis, Hugh Jackman and Ben Mendelsohn each reading a chosen chapter.|$|E

In order to represent the changes in time frames throughout the episodes, several of the cast were required to have their make-up adjusted between scenes. This included adding grey make-up to the dog actor who portrayed Archer's dog, Porthos, but the scene was cut from the final broadcast. Costume changes were made to represent promotions granted to the characters over the changes in time periods. These included Bakula who wore a wig during the later time periods shown in the episode. The wig he wore had originally been created for Gary Graham {{in his role as}} Ambassador Soval. The sets on the Enterprise were dressed to represent ongoing wear and tear.|$|E

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of the study was to yield {{information}} on intergenerational differences in descriptions of life-span stages. The setting for the investigation was Hong Kong; the participants were 248 Hong Kong Chinese (ranging from 9 to 63 years of age). Participants generated three words which in their opinions described each of eight age-stages, 0 - 9 through 70 - 79. Response protocols were scored positive, neutral, or negative, and the easiest and <b>hardest</b> age-decades <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> were identified. Results indicated that younger age groups were easiest to describe; older age groups and the respondents' own age group were <b>hardest</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe.</b> Females were significantly more positive than males in their descriptions. There was a tendency for older age groups to be more positive in their descriptions than younger-age respondents. Younger age-decades were described more positively than older-age decades. Discussion was in terms of traditional concepts of Chinese socialization practices, the Confucian concept of filial piety, and other cross-cultural research. © 1983. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Aside from unknown models, featured in the book are actress Isabella Rossellini, rappers Big Daddy Kane and Madonna's then boyfriend Vanilla Ice, model Naomi Campbell, gay porn star Joey Stefano, actor Udo Kier, socialite Tatiana von Fürstenberg, and nightclub owner Ingrid Casares; however the heterosexual photos in the book involve only Madonna and Vanilla Ice. Madonna herself is featured partially or completely naked. One of the book's most famous photographs shows Madonna hitchhiking completely naked in Miami.

As an application we significantly improve known estimates from below on the extremal behaviour of harmonic measure, showing how to constuct a rather simple snowflake, which has a spectrum quite close to the conjectured extremal value. ...|$|R

2500|$|H.L. Mencken {{considered}} Halsted {{the greatest}} physician {{of the whole}} Johns Hopkins group, and Mencken’s praise of his achievements when he reviewed Dr. MacCallum's 1930 biography is a memorable tribute. “His contributions to surgery were numerous and various. He introduced the use of local anesthetics, {{he was the first}} to put on rubber gloves, and he devised many new and ingenious operations. But his chief service was rather more general, and <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe.</b> It was to bring in a new and better way of regarding the patient. Antisepsis and asepsis, coming in when he was young, had turned the attention of surgeons to external and often extraneous things. Fighting germs, they tended to forget the concrete sick man on the table. Dr. Halsted changed all that. He showed that manhandled tissues, though they could not yell, could yet suffer and die. He studied the natural recuperative powers of the body, and showed how they could be made to help the patient. He stood against reckless slashing, and taught that a surgeon must walk very warily. Dr. William Mayo, one of the cofounders of the Mayo Clinic, once commented that Dr. Halsted took so long to perform procedures that the patients usually healed before he had a chance to close the incision. Though, like most men of his craft, he had no religion, he yet revived and reinforced the ancient saying of Ambroise Paré: ‘God cured him; I assisted.’ Above all, he was a superb teacher, though he never formally taught. The young men who went out from his operating room were magnificently trained, and are among the great ornaments of American surgery today.” ...|$|E

Using this significantly simplified description, which can be applied quite generally, we compute braiding properties of quasielectrons and quasiholes and show that the charge distribution of quasielectrons is minus the charge distribution of quasiholes for different models in the disc and the torus geometry. We also derive few-body Hamiltonians, for which various states containing quasielectrons are ground states. Comment: 5 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

More general frameworks exist, but they make it <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>describe</b> and analyze shapes.
