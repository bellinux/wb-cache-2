One of the methods is by using cryptography algorithm to encrypt the data. Using the cryptography algorithm, no one can take the true information except the one with right key and decryption method. In data security processing, microcontroller {{can be used as a}} processor. In this paper, a simple cryptography algorithm for microcontroller was proposed for data (text) encryption and decryption. This algorithm can encrypt text (8 characters) with 8 key characters. The encrypted text (chipertext) can be decrypted to the original text (plaintext) by using the same key entered in encryption process. Experiment results show that the algorithm can work properly with error percentage of 0 %.
