25|$|The dragons in {{the story}} are scaled, fire-spewing, reptilian creatures with animal-level intelligence. Though some {{accompanying}} artwork <b>for</b> <b>A</b> <b>Song</b> of Ice and Fire portrays them with four legs and a detached set of wings, George R.R. Martin insists that this is incorrect. His dragons are serpentine and slender, and they have four (not six) extremities (consider the wyvern), of which two are the front wings. Martin first considered having the Targaryens use a pyrotechnic effect to feign dragon powers, but decided on living dragons instead, though he refused to give them human speech. Comparing the dragons to modern-day nuclear arsenals, Martin questions whether supreme power enables the user to reform, improve, or build society.|$|E
