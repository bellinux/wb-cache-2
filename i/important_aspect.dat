Sidney Rosenzweig argues that such readings are reductive and that the most <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of the film is its ambiguity, above all in the central character of Rick; he cites the different names which each character gives Rick (Richard, Ricky, Mr. Rick, Herr Rick and boss) as evidence of the different meanings which he has for each person.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{have lived}} in Shetland since the Mesolithic period. The {{earliest}} written references to the islands date back to Roman times. The early historic period was dominated by Scandinavian influences, especially from Norway, and the islands did not become part of Scotland until the 15th century. When Scotland {{became part of the}} Kingdom of Great Britain in 1707, trade with northern Europe decreased. Fishing has continued to be an <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of the economy up to the present day.

5|$|In England, the seventh-century bishop Aldhelm was {{the most}} {{influential}} hermeneutic writer; Latin scholarship declined in the ninth century, and when it revived in the tenth, the hermeneutic style became increasingly influential. Unlike in continental Europe, where it was used only by a minority of writers, in tenth-century England it became nearly universal. It was the house style of the English Benedictine Reform, the most important intellectual movement in later Anglo-Saxon England. The style fell out of favour after the Norman Conquest, and the twelfth-century chronicler William of Malmesbury described it as disgusting and bombastic. Historians were equally dismissive until the late twentieth century, when scholars such as Michael Lapidge argued {{that it should be}} taken seriously as an <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of late Anglo-Saxon culture.|$|E
5|$|Multiple vassalage {{became an}} <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> of Romanian {{diplomacy}} after the Christian Balkan states (Bulgaria, Serbia) {{one by one}} fell to the Ottoman Empire in the course {{the second half of}} the 14th century. For example, Mircea the Elder (1386‚Äì1418) accepted the suzerainty of Poland in 1387 and that of Hungary in 1395, and Wallachia was paying tribute to the Ottoman Empire from 1417. When accepting Hungarian suzerainty, the princes of Wallachia usually also received the district of FƒÉgƒÉra≈ü in Transylvania from the Hungarian monarchs, for example in 1366 King Louis I of Hungary (1342‚Äì1382) granted the region to Prince Vladislav I of Wallachia (1364‚Äì1377), with the title of duke, and Prince Mircea the Elder received it from King Sigismund (1387‚Äì1437).|$|E

Kline believes the two began a friendship based on the discussion of literature and his willingness to review her work; Yeats biographer Foster adds they were drawn together by a mutual interest in the occult.

5|$|The {{severity}} of the injury is an <b>important</b> <b>aspect</b> in determining how much sexual function returns as a person recovers. According to the American Spinal Injury Association grading scale, an incomplete SCI {{is one in which}} some amount of sensation or motor function is preserved in the rectum. This indicates that the brain can still send and receive some messages to the lowest parts of the spinal cord, beyond the damaged area. In people with incomplete injury, {{some or all of the}} spinal tracts involved in sexual responses remain intact, allowing, for example, orgasms like those of uninjured people. In men, having an incomplete injury improves chances of being able to achieve erections and orgasms over those with complete injuries.|$|E
