5|$|In July 2007, {{the museum}} pushed back the {{expected}} completion date by 18 months, {{due in part to}} issues with the boiler restoration. By January 2009, with further problems encountered including misaligned frames and a cracked right hand cylinder, as well as due to rising metal prices, the museum launched the SOS (Save Our Scotsman) appeal, seeking to raise a further £250,000, hoping to complete the work by 2010. In May 2011, the locomotive was unveiled on the museum's turntable, finished in wartime black LNER livery; following final testing it was planned to finish it in LNER apple green and have it running excursions by the summer. In June 2011, cracks were discovered in the horn blocks, which led to further testing which discovered numerous latent cracks throughout the <b>frame</b> <b>assembly,</b> leading to the replacement of the main stretcher bar, horn ties and middle cylinder motion bracket, all of which were deemed beyond repair.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} of filming, Richter had a 300-page book called The Essential Buckaroo that {{consisted}} of notes and had every incomplete script Mac Rauch wrote over the years. Principal photography began during {{the second week of}} September 1983 on locations in and around South Gate, an industrial suburb of L.A. Buckaroo's neurosurgery scene with New Jersey was shot at the Lakeview Medical Center in the San Fernando Valley. The jet car sequences were shot in October on a dry lake north of the San Bernardino Mountains. The vehicle was designed and built by Riva, art director Stephen Dane and Thrust Racing owners Jerry Segal and George Haddebeck. Segal started with a Ford F-350 truck, reinforced the <b>frame</b> <b>assembly,</b> added the front end from a Grand National stock car, borrowed air scoops from a DC-3, and a one-man cockpit modeled after a Messerschmitt fighter plane. Under the hood, Segal modified the Ford engine with an oversized carburetor and nitrous oxide injectors. The Oscillation Overthruster was created by Riva and visual effects supervisor Michael Fink out of a gyroscope to which a metal frame, wires, circuits, and tiny strobe lights were added. The design was the basis for the Flux Capacitor in the 1985 film Back to the Future. The prop itself would ultimately be reused a number of times on various Star Trek episodes.|$|E
40|$|AbstractInsulation {{materials}} {{may give}} a different {{contribution to the}} fire resistance of timber <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies.</b> At present, Eurocode 5 Part 1 - 2 [1] provides a model for fire design of the load bearing function of timber <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> with cavities completely filled with stone wool. The extension of this model for glass wool for post protection phase has {{been published in the}} European technical guideline Fire Safety in Timber Buildings [2]. Very {{little is known about the}} protection of bio-based insulation materials. Eight model scale furnace tests of floor specimens were carried out. Two different design tools to calculate the charring rate of timber <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> insulated with wooden based insulations are provided. The first one is a design model for timber <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> insulated with batt-type and loose fill cellulose fiber insulations. The second tool includes the functions of conductivity, specific heat and loss in mass against the temperature calibrated on the standard fire curve to implement advanced heat transfer calculations. The purpose is to give the designers two design procedures with a different level of complexity and accuracy...|$|R

30|$|Whereas fire {{testing of}} light timber <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> focuses on gypsum board {{protection}} for floor and wall assemblies, fire testing for heavy timber assemblies has been performed on a wider spectrum of products. Fire behavior of engineered timber {{is similar to}} that of wood sections. However, the larger section size provides a greater area, allowing the charring behavior to provide inherent fire resistance.|$|R

30|$|Full-scale fire {{testing for}} {{post-tensioned}} timber <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> has primarily been performed in New Zealand, with summaries provided by Spellman (Spellman 2012) (Spellman, Carradine, Abu, Moss, & Buchanan, 2012). These assemblies consist of large timber sections with embedded steel tendons that provide increased structural strength. While the timber sections provide inherent fire resistance {{due to their}} depth, {{it is important that}} sufficient protection be provided to post-tensioned connection elements to maintain stability in fire.|$|R

Photonitride reaction chamber receives silane, ammonia, and mercury from mixing manifold to form passivating coating on IC's. Photonitride layer is barrier to moisture and penetration by mobile ions, {{and helps to}} protect IC devices subjected to severe mechanical handling or circuit repair procedures. Process is compatible with variety of wire-bonded lead <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies.</b> Advantages over plasma and sputtering deposition processes are low deposition temperature and zero stray radiation and ion levels...|$|R
50|$|The driving spring {{assemblies}} {{held the}} lock frame against the carrier dog until the carrier {{was released by}} carrier catch which was pivoted by the incoming round. The springs then drove the lock <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> forward to operate the ejector, chamber the round and raise the breech block.|$|E
50|$|The H2 {{was built}} under {{contract}} by AM General at a specially constructed plant in Mishawaka, Indiana, USA. The H2's final <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> {{is made up}} of 3 sections: The front uses a modified GM 2500-Series utility frame, the midsection is all new, and the rear section uses a modified GM 1500-Series frame which is upgraded for the 8600 lb gross vehicle weight.|$|E
50|$|The lock {{frame was}} {{retracted}} by recoil action during automatic firing and is forced {{forward by the}} driving springs. The major function of the lock <b>frame</b> <b>assembly</b> was to force the cartridge into the chamber, actuate the breech block, fire the round {{by means of the}} hammer striking the firing pin, extract the cartridge case from the chamber, and operate the ejector.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} version used {{upper and lower}} square-section steel frames, clad with glass fibre panels and large flat glass windows. On most models sliding side windows acted as doors. It used {{the front and rear}} sub frames and mechanical components from the British Leyland Mini, Metro or BMC1100/1300. The Hustler came in four and six wheel versions: the six wheel version used two Mini rear sub <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies.</b> The style was very much off-road/utility in the rectilinear idiom of the Lagonda and Bulldog.|$|R
50|$|The engine, dashboard, sheetmetal, and chassis {{are shared}} with the Tundra, with the {{exception}} of rear disc brakes and a more sophisticated multi-link live axle rear suspension. The Sequoia was nominated for the North American Truck of the Year award in 2001. When the Sequoia was introduced, it was slightly longer than the contemporary Land Cruiser, larger than the Chevrolet Tahoe in most dimensions and similar in size to the Ford Expedition; its V8 engine was certified as an Ultra Low Emission Vehicle. <b>Frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> and driveshafts are produced by Dana Holding Corporation.|$|R
30|$|Temporary {{stabilisation}} {{should be}} performed {{as soon as possible}} but preferably during daylight hours on a designated operating list. A careful restoration of alignment with the external fixator must be considered at this early stage. Fixator constructs vary with ‘delta’ and ‘A’ <b>frames</b> <b>assemblies</b> being most common. An extension of the fixator onto the forefoot (usually the first metatarsal) is helpful to avoid an equinus contracture. This method of skeletal stabilisation has superseded calcaneal traction as it permits patient mobilisation albeit non-weight bearing. In some centres, patients are sent home whilst awaiting soft tissue recovery and definitive management.|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to indentify advanced wall <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> applicable for residential and small commercial buildings, that have or could reach R-values larger than R-SI - 3. 5 m(2) K/W (U-value lower from 0. 29). An extensive literature review of existing and past practices is used as the main vehicle to analyze: framing and wall insulation methods, architectural details with focus on minimizing thermal bridges, structural adequacy aspects with respect to gravity and lateral loads, and ability to provide fire and sound breaks. In this paper a wide selection of advance <b>framing</b> wall <b>assemblies</b> is discussed in details with main focus on construction methods, architectural details with minimized thermal bridges, and structural (strength) concerns. High performance wall technologies of consideration include: double walls, Larsen truss walls, optimum or advanced framing walls, walls using distance spacers (furring) and walls made of wood-based composites. Since wood framing for wall applications is mostly used in North America, Scandinavia, and Central Europe, this study is focused on research studies from these regions. In addition, field test studies are presented discussing an application of high R-value of new and retrofitted wall assemblies in actual test houses that have been constructed and being currently monitored...|$|R

40|$|The finite strip {{method is}} used to {{determine}} the natural frequencies of shear wall frame buildings. The structure can be modelled in two different ways. In the first approach both the shear walls and the frames are idealized simply as an assemblage of finite strips varying thicknesses with given or computed properties, while in the second approach the shear walls are still idealized as a series of finite strips, but the frames are regarded as a number of long columns which are interconnected with each other or with finite strips through the horizontal beams. Numerical results obtained from both models indicate good agreement with finite element solutions. The proposed models can be applied {{to a wide range of}} shear wall <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies</b> and are therefore more versatile than most existing models. 14 refs. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Self {{piercing}} riveted {{connections are}} increasingly used in steel framed housing in Australia. It involves the joining {{of two or}} more plates by using a rivet to pierce and clinch in a single operation. In order to enhance the use of this efficient connection technology, attempts were made recently to develop a universal rivet type {{that can be used in}} most steel house <b>frame</b> <b>assemblies.</b> This required structural testing of the new rivet type in two and three plate assemblies to determine their strengths and the effects of many influential parameters such as steel thickness and grade, order of joining and the number of plates, rivet and die types. More than 150 standard lap shear tests were undertaken for this purpose. This paper presents the results from this experimental study and the results. 1...|$|R
