It also underscores the importance of applying an optimized flocculation-testing regime, which has not been adopted by these researchers. The final part of the report proposes a research scheme which should lead to a successful choice of flocculants, <b>filtration</b> <b>aids</b> (surfactants) and <b>a</b> <b>filtration</b> regime, as well recommendations for work that should be carried out to make up for the deficiencies of the limited WSRC work where a better performance should be the outcome...|$|R
40|$|Fabric filter has a {{short life}} span due to {{wear and tear}} {{influenced}} by the operating conditions of the system. Treatment of fabric filter using pre-coating material {{is one of the}} simplest technique to overcome this problem where it works as <b>a</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>aids</b> that will coat a layer of inert material onto the surface of the fabric. Pre-coating acts as a barrier to block and remove undesired particles from gas stream but allowing a uniform air flow passing through the filter media. The morphology of dust cake that accumulated {{on the surface of the}} filter media depends on several properties of the particles such as shape and size. Hence, study presents the characterization of <b>a</b> newly formulated <b>filtration</b> <b>aids</b> known as PrekotAC consisting of a different combination of pre-coating material PreKot™ and activated carbon. The aim is to determine the best combination of PrekotAC admixtures as <b>a</b> <b>filtration</b> <b>aids</b> suitable for <b>a</b> fabric filtration system. Various characteristics of the formulated admixtures such as its particle size distribution, bulk density, moisture content as well as its morphology were investigated and presented in this paper...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A novel {{copolymer}} PADA {{which has}} two functions of flocculation and surface activity was synthesized in aqueous solution. The copolymer {{was applied to}} <b>filtration</b> <b>aiding</b> on wet-process phosphoric acid (WPA). The results show that PADA can increase the filtration rate of the phosphoric acid slurry and decrease the moisture of the filter cake. The mechanism of <b>filtration</b> <b>aiding</b> was studied. PADA neutralizes the surface potential of the phosphogypsum and makes the microcrystal particles flocculate to conglobation, which indicate that electrostatic neutralization and flocculation might be the action modes {{in the process of}} <b>filtration</b> <b>aiding.</b> The shortest flocculation time and largest average diameter of floccules can be obtained with the addition of 10 ppm PADA. The average pore size and porosity of the filter cake are enlarged by 0. 22 µm and 15. 38 % respectively with the addition of PADA. The surface contact angle of the phosphogypsum is increased by 3. 4 ° with PADA presence...|$|R

40|$|Let p:E B be a fibration over a {{connected}} space B with fiber F. The Eilenberg-Moore spectral sequence of p {{is a second}} quadrant spectral sequence which tries and sometimes fails to converge strongly to the homology of F (see 1 - 53). The {{purpose of this paper}} is to determine what the spectral sequence does converge to. An abstract answer (Theorem 1. 1) is that the spectral sequence almost always converges to the homology of the fiber of the nilpotent completion of the map p. A concrete answer (Theorem 2. 1) is that under certain natural conditions on B and certain finiteness hypotheses the spectral sequence converges weakly to the homology of F with the nl(B) <b>filtration.</b> <b>As</b> <b>an</b> <b>aid</b> to understanding these theorems, recall the similar behavior of the mod q Adams spectral sequence of a spectrum X. In absolute generality the spectral sequence converges only to the homotopy groups of some completion of X [1]. However, if X is connected and suitable finiteness conditions are satisfied, the spectral sequence converges to the actual homotopy groups of X with the "power of q " filtration. Note also that the spectral sequence converge...|$|R

50|$|Because of its low {{density and}} {{relatively}} low price (about US$50 per tonne of unexpanded perlite), many commercial applications for perlite have developed. In {{the construction and}} manufacturing fields, it is used in lightweight plasters, concrete and mortar (masonry), insulation and ceiling tiles. In horticulture, perlite {{can be used as}} a soil amendment or alone as a medium for hydroponics or for starting cuttings. When used as an amendment it has high permeability / low water retention and helps prevent soil compaction. Perlite is <b>an</b> excellent <b>filtration</b> <b>aid</b> and is used extensively as an alternative to diatomaceous earth. The popularity of perlite usage as a filter medium is growing considerably worldwide. Perlite filters are fairly commonplace in filtering beer before it is bottled.|$|R
