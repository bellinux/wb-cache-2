5|$|Switzerland's most {{important}} economic sector is manufacturing. Manufacturing consists largely {{of the production}} of specialist chemicals, health and pharmaceutical goods, scientific and precision measuring instruments and musical instruments. The largest exported goods are chemicals (34% of exported goods), machines/electronics (20.9%), and precision instruments/watches (16.9%). Exported services amount {{to a third of}} exports. The service sector – especially banking and insurance, tourism, and <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> – is another important industry for Switzerland.|$|E

5|$|In 1921 the Metre Convention was {{extended}} to cover all units of measure, not just length and mass and in 1933 the 8th CGPM resolved {{to work with other}} international bodies to agree standards for electrical units that could be related back to the international prototypes. Since 1954 the CIPM committee that oversees the definition of units of measurement, the Consultative Committee for Units, has representatives from many <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> including the ISR, IEC and ISO under the chairmanship of the CIPM.|$|E
5|$|The British Nationality Act 1981 {{reclassified}} Hong Kong into a British Dependent Territory {{amid the}} reorganisation of global territories of the British Empire. All residents of Hong Kong became British Dependent Territory Citizens (BDTC). Diplomatic negotiations began with China and eventually concluded with the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration. Both countries agreed to transfer Hong Kong's sovereignty to China on 1 July 1997, when Hong Kong would remain autonomous {{as a special}} administrative region {{and be able to}} retain its free-market economy, British common law through the Hong Kong Basic Law, independent representation in <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> (e.g. WTO and WHO), treaty arrangements and policy-making except foreign diplomacy and military defence.|$|E

5|$|The {{motivation}} {{for the development of}} the SI was the diversity of units that had sprung up within the CGS systems and the lack of coordination between the various disciplines that used them. The CGPM, which was established by the Metre Convention of 1875, brought together many <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> to not only agree on the definitions and standards of the new system but also agree on the rules for writing and presenting measurements in a standardised manner around the world.|$|E
5|$|Until 1875, the French {{government}} {{owned the}} prototype metre and kilogram, {{but in that}} year the Convention of the metre was signed, {{and control of the}} standards relating to mass and length passed to a trio of inter-governmental organisations, the senior of which was the General Conference on Weights and Measures (in French the Conférence générale des poids et mesures or CGPM). During {{the first half of the}} 20th century, the CGPM cooperated with a number of other organisations, and by 1960 it had responsibility for defining temporal, electrical, thermal, molecular and luminar measurements, while other <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> continued their roles in how these units of measurement were used.|$|E

5|$|Jack Crawford's {{victory in}} 1933 {{was the first}} time a foreign player had won the tournament since 1891. Following his victory, no French players won the title up until 1940, when the tournament was {{suspended}} following the outbreak of the Second World War. Don Budge's victory in 1938 was notable, as he won all of the Grand Slam tournaments during the year. Though the event was suspended in 1940, it was held unofficially under the guise of the Tournoi de France. Bernard Destremau won the first two events, while Yvon Petra won three from 1942 to 1945. These results are not recognised by the FFT or other major <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> and are considered unofficial. Marcel Bernard won the first event {{after the end of the}} war in 1946; he was the only Frenchman to win the event before the advent of the Open era in 1968.|$|E
5|$|The {{international}} community’s {{political stance}} towards Kampuchea had a severe {{impact on the}} Vietnamese economy, which was already wrecked by decades of continuous conflicts. The United States, which already had sanctions in place against Vietnam, convinced other countries of the United Nations to deprive Vietnam and the People’s Republic of Kampuchea of much-needed funds by denying them membership to major <b>international</b> <b>organisations</b> such as the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and the International Monetary Fund. In 1979 Japan stepped up the pressure by suspending all economic aid to Vietnam, and warned Vietnamese leaders that economic aid would only resume when Vietnam amended its policies towards Kampuchea, the Sino-Soviet rivalry {{and the problem of}} the boat people. Sweden, which was considered the staunchest supporter of Vietnam in the West, also considered reducing its commitments to the communist country as virtually every other country cancelled its aid.|$|E
5|$|The united Germany is {{considered}} to be the enlarged continuation of the Federal Republic of Germany and not a successor state. As such, it retained all of West Germany's memberships in <b>international</b> <b>organisations.</b> Based on the Berlin/Bonn Act, adopted in 1994, Berlin once again became the capital of the reunified Germany, while Bonn obtained the unique status of a Bundesstadt (federal city) retaining some federal ministries. The relocation of the government was completed in 1999. Following the 1998 elections, SPD politician Gerhard Schröder became the first Chancellor of a red–green coalition with the Alliance '90/The Greens party. Among the major projects of the two Schröder legislatures was the Agenda 2010 to reform the labour market to become more flexible and reduce unemployment.|$|E
