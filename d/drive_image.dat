40|$|Both {{testing of}} {{computer}} storage forensics tools, and education in conducting computer forensics require reference <b>drive</b> <b>images</b> with known characteristics.

40|$|Efficiently {{managing}} {{storage is}} important for virtualized computing environments. Its importance is magnified by developments such as cloud computing which consolidate many thousands of virtual machines (and their associated storage). The nature of this storage is such {{that there is a}} large amount of duplication between otherwise discreet virtual machines. Building upon previous work in content addressable storage, we have built a prototype for consolidating virtual disk images using a service-oriented file system. It provides a hierarchical organization, manages historical snapshots of <b>drive</b> <b>images,</b> and takes steps to optimize encoding based on partition type and file system. In this paper we present our experiences with building this prototype and using it to store a variety of <b>drive</b> <b>images</b> for QEMU and the Linux Kernel Virtual Machine (KVM). ...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimited. To determine {{the usage of}} XOR {{and the need to}} adapt additional tools, we analyzed 2, 411 <b>drive</b> <b>images</b> from devices acquired around the world for the use of bytewise XOR as an obfuscation technique. Using {{a modified version of the}} open source digital forensics tool bulk˙extractor, evidence of XOR obfuscation was found on 698 <b>drive</b> <b>images,</b> with a maximum of 21, 031 XOR-obfuscated features on a single drive. XOR usage in our corpus was observed in files with timestamps between the years 1995 and 2009, but the majority use was found in unallocated space. On the corpus tested, XOR obfuscation was used to circumvent malware detection and reverse engineering, to hide information that was apparently being exfiltrated, and by malware detection tools for their quarantine directory and to distribute malware signatures.

40|$|A cathodochromic (CC) {{storage and}} display system capable of storing full TV {{resolution}} images has been built.

Once stored on the CC CRT, the image can be read out in one of three modes: with the eye, a 35 -mm camera, or a TV camera. Incoming information may also be stored in a storage tube similar to the CC CRT but with a phosphor layer behind the CC layer. By exciting the phosphor layer with a standard raster scan it is possible to read out an image stored in the CC layer in one of three modes: direct viewing, photography, or flying-spot readout using a photomultiplier...|$|E
40|$|Tiling {{projectors}} {{provides an}} effective and easy option to increase screen space. Differences in projectors' components however contribute to non-uniformities in illumination and colour and detract from image quality and useability. In collaboration with JVC we developed a compact, high-resolution, uniform, tiled projection computer display based on a single common light source. A single set of red, green and blue dichroic filters provides the red, green and blue illuminations which are then guided by optical fibres to the projectors D-ILA (Direct <b>Drive</b> <b>Image</b> Light Amplifier) chips, JVC's projector technology. This results in a uniform illumination across the tiled projectors, a single colour temperature and a single colour balanced spectrum, with improved image uniformity. The display is driven by a graphics computer cluster running Linux and fitted with Nvidia graphics cards. We illustrate applications of this new display system with scientific applications in medical imaging and in radar imaging for archaeology...|$|E

The results indicate that XOR obfuscation is important to consider when performing malware investigations. However, since the corpus does not contain data sets that are known to have been used by malicious entities, it is difficult to draw conclusions regarding the importance of extracting and examining XOR obfuscated files in criminal, counterintelligence and counterterrorism cases without further research...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Global {{analysis}} {{is a useful}} supplement to local forensic analysis {{of the details of}} files in a <b>drive</b> <b>image.</b> This paper reports on experiments with global methods to find time patterns associated with disks and files. The Real Disk Corpus of over 1000 drive images from eight countries was used as a corpus. The data was clustered into 63 subsets based on file and directory type, and times were analyzed statistically for each subset. Fourteen important subsets of the files were identified based on their times, including default times (zero, low-default, high-default, and on the hour), bursts of activity (one-time, periodic in the week, and periodic in the day), and those having particular equalities or inequalities between any two of creation, modification, and access times. Using overall statistics for each drive, fourteen kinds of drive usage were recognized such as a business operating primarily in the evening. Additional work examined the connection between file times and registry times, and proposed adapting these methods to sampled rather than complete data is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Geolocation {{data have}} high value to {{forensic}} investigators because computer activities {{may be associated}} with physical locations in the past. However, locating and extracting useful location information from an off-line disk image is a difficult problem. Most forensic investigations employ tools that focus on extracting content, such as emails, databases, and hidden or deleted data, and then manually investigate the results with practices like keyword searches. While this can work on a drive-by-drive basis, without a uniform approach to the location question, it is easy for an investigator to miss an answer that could be found from an evaluated technique known to other investigators. To determine drive location, we develop a two-step approach that analyzes a <b>drive</b> <b>image</b> for geolocation purposes, finding substantial location information in HTTP headers from common and default sources. First, we extract HTTP headers from the memory page (swap) files that reside on the hard drive. Second, we apply a weight based algorithm that parses those headers to determine the past geographical locations of the drive. We apply our method to drive images from the publicly available M 57 Patents corpus and identify the hard drives ’ location with low recall but high precision. ...|$|E
