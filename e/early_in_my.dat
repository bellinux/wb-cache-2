2500|$|To {{supplement}} his income, {{the young}} Domingo {{played the piano}} for a ballet company, [...] {{as well as for}} a program on Mexico's newly founded cultural television station. The program consisted of excerpts from zarzuelas, operettas, operas, and musical comedies. He acted in a few small parts while at the theater in plays by Federico García Lorca, Luigi Pirandello, and Anton Chekhov. He also provided song arrangements and backup vocals for Los Camisas Negras in the late 1950s, a rock-and-roll band led by César Costa. In his autobiography, Domingo reflected on the benefits of his busy and varied career as a teenager: [...] "Today, when people ask me how I manage to hold up under my extremely heavy work load, I answer that I became accustomed to intense activity very <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life and that I love it now as I loved it then." ...|$|E
2500|$|It took eight {{working days}} to shoot an episode, and days were {{regularly}} 14–20 hours long. Lauren Graham said: [...] "We filmed alongside The West Wing, and Aaron Sorkin shows {{are known for}} having the worst hours ever, they go on and on, but we were always there even after they had gone home, because you couldn't change a word of the script." [...] The cast were required to be word-perfect in all the scenes, while also reciting large amounts of dialogue at speed. Matt Czuchry, who had a main role for the final three seasons, commented [...] "The pace of the dialogue was what made that show incredibly unique, and also incredibly difficult as an actor. To {{be able to maintain}} that speed, tone, and at the same time, try to make layered choices was a great experience to have <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career. It really challenged me." [...] The combination of the difficult dialogue and long takes meant each scene had to be shot many times; Graham said in 2015: [...] "never before or since have I done as many takes of anything". Alexis Bledel recalled that one scene required 38 takes. Graham added, [...] "that show – as fun and breezy and light as it is – is technically really challenging".|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, Anderson {{made her}} first {{appearance}} in Vincenzo Bellini's Norma at the Lyric Opera of Chicago. [...] The Chicago Tribune noted that Anderson's [...] "clear, bright upper range was at its clarion best, the soprano singing with strength and nuanced sensitivity" [...] and hailed her acting as well: [...] "ramatically, Anderson was exceptional, drawing {{out all of the}} conflicting emotions with an intensity tempered by dignity." [...] Later in 1997, she returned to the Opera Orchestra of New York to portray her first Elvira in Verdi's Ernani. [...] In 1998, Anderson spoke in Opera News of her move away from light coloratura roles [...] "into deeper water":I wanted to put it off as long as possible. I kept saying, and it's been quoted so many times, I didn't want to do [...] "Normina." [...] I wanted to do Norma. And Leonora. I didn't want to sound like a soubrette trying to do these things. I've done things like Il Corsaro and La Battaglia di Legnano very <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> career, so Verdi's always been a presence. I did mostly Rigolettos and Traviatas, and then I added Desdemona a few years ago. ... So I suppose Leonora would be next in line." ...|$|E

60|$|While {{standing}} beside Hal, undecided as to my next move, I heard a whistle. It was faint, perhaps miles away, yet unmistakably {{it was the}} whistle of an engine. I wondered if the railroad turned round {{this side of the}} peaks. Mounting Hal, I rode down the forest to the point where I had seen the men, and there came upon a trail. I proceeded along this in the direction the men had taken. I had come again to the slow-rising level that I had noted <b>earlier</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> morning's journey.

60|$|Very <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, {{possibly}} {{because of the}} insatiable curiosity that was born in me, I came to dislike the performances of trained animals.

It was a body of cruelty so horrible that I am confident no normal person exists who, once aware of it, could ever enjoy looking on at any trained-animal turn.|$|E
40|$|The weather <b>in</b> <b>early</b> 2000 {{was some}} of the warmest and driest on record. Mild dry weather <b>in</b> March allowed <b>early</b> oat {{planting}} <b>in</b> excellent seed beds.

With these challenges, corn yields were variable (90 - 160 bu/acre) but averaged 127. 5 bu/acre. Early planted soybeans yielded better than later plantings. Our average soybean yield was 42 bu/acre.

60|$|I remember--but I out-run my story. First {{let me tell}} of Lop-Ear and our friendship. Very <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> life, I {{separated}} from my mother. Possibly this was because, {{after the death of}} my father, she took to herself a second husband. I have few recollections of him, and they are not of the best. He was a light fellow. There was no solidity to him. He was too voluble. His infernal chattering worries me even now as I think of it. His mind was too inconsequential to permit him to possess purpose. Monkeys in their cages always remind me of him. He was monkeyish. That is the best description I can give of him.|$|E
60|$|I, on {{the other}} hand, had luck. For some reason the boys agreed to accept me. Quite <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> sojourn I enjoyed that sweetest triumph of the assistant-master's life, the {{spectacle}} of one boy smacking another boy's head because the latter persisted in making a noise after I {{had told him to}} stop. I doubt if a man can experience so keenly in any other way that thrill which comes from the knowledge that the populace is his friend. Political orators must have the same sort of feeling when their audience clamours for the ejection of a heckler, but it cannot be so keen. One is so helpless with boys, unless they decide that they like one.|$|E
60|$|I find it now {{impossible}} {{to trace the}} phases by which I reached these broad ideas upon which I rest all my work, but certainly they were present very <b>early</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> discussions with Gidding. We two men had been thinking independently but very similarly, {{and it is hard}} to say just what completing touches either of us gave to the other's propositions. We found ourselves rather than arrived at the conception of ourselves as the citizens neither of the United States nor of England but of a state that had still to come into being, a World State, a great unity behind and embracing the ostensible political fabrics of to-day--a unity to be reached by weakening antagonisms, by developing understandings and toleration, by fostering the sense of brotherhood across the ancient bounds.|$|E

5000|$|On the {{way from}} Delphi to the summit of Parnassus, about sixty stades distant from Delphi, there is a bronze image.

The roof stands at a sufficient height from the floor, and water, rising in part from springs but still more dripping from the roof, has made clearly visible the marks of drops on the floor throughout the cave. The dwellers around Parnassus believe it to be sacred to the Corycian nymphs, and especially to Pan. (10.32.2 - 7) ...|$|R

My mother thought that Order prevailed, and that disorder was just incidental and foredoomed rebellion; I feel and have always felt that order rebels against and struggles against disorder, that order has an up-hill job, in gardens, experiments, suburbs, everything alike; from the very beginnings of my experience I discovered hostility to order, a constant escaping from control.|$|E
