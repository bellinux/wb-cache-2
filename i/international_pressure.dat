Pechersky was prevented by the Soviet government from testifying in multiple international trials related to Sobibor, including the Eichmann Trial in Israel. The last time he was refused the permission to exit the country and testify was in 1987, for a trial in Poland.|$|E

In retaliation, Serb forces attacked Zagreb with rockets, killing 7 and wounding over 200 civilians.

5|$|On 22 October, as the HV neared {{completion}} of the operations to secure Konavle, the 4th Guards Brigade and the 163rd Infantry Brigade moved north-east from Dubrovnik and attacked the VRS positions closest to the city. The main HV attack, assigned to the 3rd and the 5th Battalions of the 4th Guards Brigade, was directed to capture Vlaštica Peak. The 1st Battalion and an independent armoured-mechanized company of the 4th Guards Brigade were deployed to draw {{off some of the}} VRS defences as they attacked towards the village of Cerovac and Hum railway station. The 163rd Infantry Brigade supported the main axis of the operation, advancing from Župa Dubrovačka towards Vlaštica. By 26 October, the VRS left flank in Popovo field collapsed and the town of Trebinje, the main Bosnian Serb centre in the region, came into jeopardy. However, Tuđman gave way to <b>international</b> <b>pressure</b> to halt the military operations around Dubrovnik and the fighting stopped by 1 November 1992.|$|E
5|$|Operation Medak Pocket {{took place}} in a salient south of Gospić, from September 9–17. The {{offensive}} was undertaken by the Croatian army to stop Serbian artillery in the area from shelling nearby Gospić. The operation met its stated objective of removing the artillery threat, as Croatian troops overran the salient, but it was marred by war crimes. The ICTY later indicted Croatian officers for war crimes. The operation was halted amid <b>international</b> <b>pressure,</b> and an agreement was reached that the Croatian troops were to withdraw to positions held prior to September 9, while UN troops were to occupy the salient alone. The events that followed remain controversial, as Canadian authorities reported that the Croatian army intermittently fought against the advancing Canadian Princess Patricia's Canadian Light Infantry before finally retreating after sustaining 27 fatalities. The Croatian ministry of defense and UN officer's testimonies given during the Ademi-Norac trial deny that the battle occurred.|$|E
5|$|The Eichmann Sonderkommando was a {{task force}} headed by Adolf Eichmann that arrived in Budapest on 19 March 1944, {{the same day that}} Axis forces invaded Hungary. Their task was to take a direct role in the {{deportation}} of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. The SS-Sonderkommandos enlisted the aide of antisemitic elements from the Hungarian gendarmerie and pro-German administrators from within the Hungarian Interior Ministry. Round-ups began on 16 April, and from 14 May, four trains of 3,000 Jews per day left Hungary and travelled to the camp at Auschwitz II-Birkenau, arriving along a newly built spur line that terminated a few hundred metres from the gas chambers. Between 10 and 25 percent of the people on each train were chosen as forced laborers; the rest were killed within hours of arrival. Under <b>international</b> <b>pressure,</b> the Hungarian government halted deportations on 6 July 1944, by which time over 437,000 of Hungary's 725,000 Jews had died.|$|E
