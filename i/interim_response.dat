40|$|International audiencePURPOSE: The {{presence}} of a bulky tumour at staging in Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a predictor of a poor outcome. The total metabolic tumour volume at baseline (TMTV 0) computed on PET may improve the evaluation of tumour burden. To explore the clinical usefulness of TMTV 0, we compared the prognostic value of TMTV 0, tumour bulk and <b>interim</b> PET <b>response</b> in a retrospective single-centre study. METHODS: From 2007 to 2010, 59 consecutive patients with a first diagnosis of HL were treated in our institution. PET was done at baseline (PET 0) and after two cycles of chemotherapy (PET 2), and treatment was not modified according to the PET 2 result. TMTV 0 was measured with a semiautomatic method using a 41  % SUVmax threshold. SUVmax reduction between PET 0 and PET 2 (ΔSUVmaxPET 0 - 2) was also computed. Based on ROC analysis, patients with a ΔSUVmaxPET 0 - 2 > 71  % were considered good responders and a TMTV 0 > 225  ml was considered to represent hypermetabolic bulky disease. RESULTS: Median TMTV 0 was 117  ml and 17 patients (29  %) had a TMTV 0 > 225  ml. TMTV 0 (> 225  ml vs. ≤ 225  ml) and tumour bulk (71  % and TMTV 0 ≤ 225  ml (n[*]=[*] 37, 63  %), ΔSUVmaxPET 0 - 2 [*]=[*] 225  ml (n[*]=[*] 17, 29  %), and ΔSUVmaxPET 0 - 2 [*]=[*] 225  ml (n[*]=[*] 5, 8  %). In these three groups the 4 -year PFS rates were 92  %, 49  %, and 20  % (p <  0. 0001), respectively. CONCLUSION: TMTV 0 is more relevant than tumour bulk for predicting the outcome in patients with HL, and adds a significant prognostic insight to <b>interim</b> PET <b>response</b> assessment. The combination of TMTV 0 and ΔSUVmaxPET 0 - 2 {{made it possible to}} identify three subsets of HL patients with different outcomes.

40|$|This {{experiment}} {{examined the}} role of delays of reinforcement in producing the response pattern generated by fixed interval (FI) schedules. Conjunctive schedules which required one response and maintained a 100 sec interreinforcement interval were used. These schedules permitted a variable delay of reinforcement to separate the last response in each interval from reinforcement. The maximum delay was specified, however, by specifying {{the percentage of the}} interval which must elapse before responses counted toward reinforcement. Maximum delays of 100, 95, 75, 50, 25, 5 and O seconds were examined and their effects on response rate, response distribution, and post-reinforcement pause were measured. The study generated the following results: (1) Although the maximum delay possible was specified, this delay was seldom taken; <b>interim</b> <b>responses</b> were emitted and the delay was shortened. Longer median delay of reinforcement produced lower response rates. (2) Fixed interval schedules produced the shortest postreinforcement pauses. When the schedule allowed longer delays the pause became longer. These changes are seen in overall distributions and only slightly affect the mean pause length. (3) When no delays were possible, e. g. on FI 100 sec, the distribution of pauses within the interval was positively accelerated. With schedules which permitted delays the distributions became less positively accelerated. Generally, the longer the delay of reinforcement, the more negatively accelerated the response distribution within the interval. These data indicate that the delay of reinforcement disrupts the FI schedule performance. Longer delays lower the rate, lengthen the pause and eliminate the pause. Dews, in 2 ̆ 2 The effects of multiple SΔ periods on responding on a fixed-interval schedule, 2 ̆ 2 Journal of the Experimental Analysis of Behavior, 1962, 5, 369 - 374, suggests that the cumulation of delays of reinforcement produces the scalloped pattern. This experiment suggests {{that this is not the}} case. Even short delays, e. g. less than 8 sec, disrupt the scalloped pattern. These data suggest that the behavior occurring at the moment of reinforcement, rather than merely the delay of reinforcement per se, determines FI schedule performance...|$|R
40|$|Why does a firm {{respond to}} a competitor's action as it does? Prior to this {{grounded}} theory study, there was no transparency, the black box of competitive response remained dark. Using {{a series of three}} embedded case studies and examining eighteen competitive responses, this study has illuminated the processes connecting the inputs and outputs related by previous content based research in competitive response. One pattern that quickly emerged was multiple responses to competitive actions/trends. Understanding why firms pursue multiple responses and what does and does not constrain their choices became the focus of this research. To widen the beam of light, this study takes a broader view of competitive response recognizing that, from an Austrian viewpoint, all responses - imitation, modified imitation or novel - can erode the advantage created by the initiating firm. To control for rival hypotheses, the participating firms were all in the same service industry characterized by high visibility that maximizes awareness and minimizes response uncertainty. Emerging from this study are five response processes, all with the potential to produce multiple responses. These processes are differentiated by their triggers, which include perceived survival threats, performance below expectations, trends with and without revenue opportunities and trends with an impact to firm identity. This study also revealed the response pressure mechanism in which a delay in the firm's main response and a looming penalty for not responding within a response window were found to generate <b>interim</b> <b>responses.</b> Implications from this study include: an initial understanding that how a firm responds depends on the triggers; a firm may respond more than once to a competitor action; responses come in all shapes, sizes and frequencies; the number of responses is dependent on the response pressure mechanism; and how a firm responds is molded by its perceptions, its current and aspired identities, and the customer appeal of the initial action. Though this study must be replicated in additional contexts to ensure generalizeability, a final contribution of this research is to demonstrate the complementary value of process and content research to allow the full picture of competitive response to take shape...|$|R

We embed this traced vaccination policy in a smallpox disease transmission model to estimate the number of cases and deaths that would result from an attack in a large urban area. Comparing the results to mass vaccination from the moment an attack is recognized, we find that mass vaccination results in both far fewer deaths and much faster epidemic eradication over a wide range of disease and intervention policy parameters, including those believed most likely, and that mass vaccination similarly outperforms the existing policy of starting with traced vaccination and switching to mass vaccination only if required.

In this study we focus on heat–mortality relationships in Toronto, Ontario, between 1980 and 1996 and evaluate the potential effectiveness of the city’s <b>interim</b> hot weatherhealth <b>response</b> plan. Using two heat stress indexes—humidex and apparent temperature—we identified excess mortality associated with hot and humid weather and then estimated excess deaths for hot and cool summers. Mortality rates for all ages and for> 64 years age groups rose with increasing humidex and apparent temperature, with no significant increase for the population < 65 years. Excess mortality occurred as low as the 30 – 35 °C humidex range, which is below the 40 °C humidex used to issue a heat warning under Toronto’s <b>interim</b> hot weather <b>response</b> plan. During a hot summer (such as 1988 or 1995), 32 excess deaths would be expected, whereas 34 fewer deaths than baseline levels would be expected during a cool summer like 1982 or 1992. Days with high humidex levels occur infrequently in Toronto, and thus exposure is limited under current climatic conditions. In the event of a warming climate, more days with dangerously high humidex levels are likely to occur, and summer deaths are expected to increase.
