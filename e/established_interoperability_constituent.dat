40|$|Abstract. Ontologies proliferate {{with the}} growth of the Semantic Web. However, most of data on the Web are still stored in {{relational}} databases. Therefore, it is important to <b>establish</b> <b>interoperability</b> between relational databases and ontologies for creating a Web of data. An effective way to achieve interoperability is finding mappings between relational database schemas and ontologies. In this paper, we propose a new approach to discovering simple mappings between a relational database schema and an ontology. It exploits simple mappings based on virtual documents, and eliminates incorrect mappings via validating mapping consistency. Additionally, it also constructs a special type of semantic mappings, called contextual mappings, which is useful for practical applications. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach performs well on several data sets from real world domains. ...|$|R

The basic idea is to perform the fuzzy clustering technique over the ontology's concepts in order to create clusters of similar concepts with estimation of medoids and membership degrees.

Considering this, this research proposes a reflection and suggests the development of an architecture for semantic bibliographic descriptions that ensures interoperability in digital information environments.

We attempt to adapt Gloss Vector relatedness measure for similarity estimation. Generally, Gloss Vector uses angles between entities’ gloss vectors for relatedness calculation. After employing Pearson’s chi-squared test for statistical elimination of insignificant features to optimize entities’ gloss vectors, by considering concepts’ taxonomy, we enrich them for better similarity measurement. Discussed measures get evaluated in the biomedical domain using MeSH, MEDLINE and dataset of 301 concept pairs. We conclude Adapted Gloss Vector similarity results are more correlated with human judgment of similarity compared to other measures...|$|R

This paper presents an integrated model for mediation on the Semantic Web with special attention to Semantic Web services that is developed around the Web Service Modeling Ontology WSMO. Covering both dimensions, we explain the techniques developed for handling different types of heterogeneity as well as the components and architecture for <b>establishing</b> <b>interoperability</b> on the Semantic Web if not given a priori...|$|R

This requires a semantic preserving transformation, which ensures that properties validated in UPPAAL models also hold for their CIF counterparts. In addition, by providing such a translation we are, at the same time, providing translations for a wider set of languages that can be transformed to CIF.

This cannot be done manually beyond a certain complexity and size of ontologies. The core contribution {{in this article is}} the Framework for Ontology Alignment and Mapping (FOAM). With FOAM we address requirements from an application-based perspective such as high quality results, efficiency, high degree of automation with optional user-interaction, flexibility with respect to use cases, and easy adjusting and parameterizing. FOAM consists of a general alignment process based on the ontology-encoded semantics, different instantiations of the process focusing on various aspects of ontology alignment, and finally the concrete implementation as a powerful but easy to use Open Source tool. The evaluation results show that the different instantiations individually outperform existing approaches. However, best results can be gained when combining them. We expect that the findings suit not only the Semantic Web community, but may solve integration problems of related computer science fields as well. 1...|$|R

To understand the notion and the central function of repositories first a short history of metadata systems is given.
