5|$|Discovering the {{tertiary}} {{structure of a}} protein, or the quaternary structure of its complexes, can provide important clues about how the protein performs its function. Common experimental methods of structure determination include X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy, both of which can produce information at atomic resolution. However, NMR experiments are able to provide information from which a subset of distances between pairs of atoms can be estimated, and the final possible conformations for a protein are determined by solving a distance geometry problem. Dual polarisation interferometry is a quantitative analytical method for measuring the overall protein conformation and conformational changes due to interactions or other stimulus. Circular dichroism is another laboratory technique for determining internal β-sheet / α-helical composition of proteins. Cryoelectron microscopy is used to produce lower-resolution structural information about very large protein complexes, including assembled viruses; a variant known as electron crystallography can also produce high-resolution information in some cases, especially for two-dimensional crystals of membrane proteins. Solved structures are usually deposited in the Protein <b>Data</b> <b>Bank</b> (PDB), a freely available resource from which structural data about thousands of proteins can be obtained {{in the form of}} Cartesian coordinates for each atom in the protein.|$|E

40|$|This article {{reports the}} results of a survey of the {{responsible}} crime laboratories in the first 19 states with legislation establishing forensic DNA <b>data</b> <b>banks.</b> The survey inquired into the labs' policies and procedures regarding the collection, storage, and analysis of samples; the retention of samples and data; search protocols; access to samples and data by third parties; and related matters. The research suggests that (1) the number of samples collected from convicted offenders for DNA <b>data</b> <b>banking</b> has far surpassed the number that have been analyzed; (2) <b>data</b> <b>banks</b> have already been used in a small but growing number of cases, to locate suspects and to identify associations between unresolved cases; (3) crime labs currently plan to retain indefinitely the samples collected for their data banks; and (4) {{the nature and extent of}} security safeguards that crime labs have implemented for their <b>data</b> <b>banks</b> vary among states. The recently enacted DNA Identification Act (1994) will provide $ 40 million in federal matching grants to states for DNA analysis activities, so long as states comply with specified quality-assurance standards, submit to external proficiency testing, and limit access to DNA information. Although these additional funds should help to ease some sample backlogs, it remains unclear how labs will allocate the funds, as between analyzing samples for their <b>data</b> <b>banks</b> and testing evidence samples in cases without suspects. The DNA Identification Act provides penalties for the disclosure or obtaining of DNA data held by <b>data</b> <b>banks</b> that participate in CODIS, the FBI's evolving national network of DNA <b>data</b> <b>banks,</b> but individual crime labs must also develop stringent internal safeguards to prevent breaches of data-bank security...|$|R

The first chapter explores the social, political and historical context in which forensic DNA <b>data</b> <b>banking</b> has emerged. The second chapter examines relevant socio-cultural transformations in the nature of power that have been taking place since the Nineteenth Century, bringing together Foucault's concept of surveillance with more recent analysis of surveillance that suggests, that as a technology of power, surveillance {{is in the process of}} changing. Risk is considered as a major force in shaping surveillance practice and discourse, specifically its influence on crime control strategies is discussed. Chapter three first contends that modern themes, which were instrumental in legitimating the development of older identification technologies, continue to play a central role in the discourse legitimating the use of DNA <b>data</b> <b>banking.</b> It also reveals that DNA <b>data</b> <b>banking</b> is premised on an ambivalent notion of crime and 'criminality'.
