40|$|The {{success of}} the {{microelectronics}} industry over more then 30 years is {{to a large extent}} based on unimaginable device scaling governed by the Moore’s law, which also resulted in performance improvements. The advances were mainly possible due to the unique properties of SiO 2, which is grown by thermal oxidation and poly silicon gate technologies which substituted aluminum metal gates and enabled the self aligned gate technologies. However, the aggressive scaling of Complementary Metal Oxide Semiconductor (CMOS) devices is driving SiO 2 based gate dielectrics to its physical limits as stated in the International Technology Roadmap for Semiconductors (ITRS). The scaling of device dimensions, especially the gate oxide thickness its physical limits required novel gate stack technologies, in which replacement of conventional SiO 2 with a high-K material is one of them. The usage of high-K gate materials enables the scaling of the equivalent oxide thickness (EOT) of gate dielectric into sub 1 nm regime while allowing much higher physical thickness. The feasibility of scaling EOT down to sub 1 nm results in degraded performance due to the gate oxide and non-ideal gate electrode. This work mainly discusses the performance issues of the CMOS devices and possible ways to make improvements. When considering the biasing conditions of a CMOS device, the n+-poly gate of a n-channel Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (NMOSFET) is biased with a positive voltage and the p+-poly gate of a p-channel Metal Oxide Semiconductor Field Effect Transistor (PMOSFET) is biased with a negative voltage. As a result of the biasing condition, a depletion layer is formed at the gate electrode-gate oxide interface. This gate depletion is called poly gate depletion effect, results in a capacitance in series with the gate oxide capacitance. This poly gate depletion capacitance results in a decreased gate capacitance and thus results in degraded device performance. In thick oxide systems, where the gate oxide is around more than 10 nm, the gate depletion effects can be neglected as the contribution from poly gate depletion capacitance is small when compared to the gate oxide capacitance. In thin oxide systems, where the oxide thickness is less than 4 nm, the poly gate depletion effect cannot be neglected. However, degenerately doped gate electrodes can be used to suppress the poly gate depletion capacitance, by decreasing the thickness of the depletion layer formed at the gate electrode-gate oxide interface. These highly doped gate electrodes combined with thin gate oxides allow the dopants to distribute through the gate oxide and thus change the dopant distribution profile in both the gate electrode and the substrate. In ultra thin oxide systems, where the EOT is less than 2 nm, the poly gate deletion effects are unavoidable despite the gate being very highly doped. The depleted poly gate consists of parasitic charges because the ionized dopants and the parasitic charge density increases with increased doping. These parasitic gate charges act as charge centers in the gate and scatter the carries in the channel thus degrading the device performance, an effect called remote Coulomb scattering. In order to decrease the effect of remote Coulomb scattering, the parasitic gate charge density should be decreased, by reducing <b>gate</b> <b>doping</b> concentration. The reduced <b>gate</b> <b>doping</b> results in increase poly gate depletion and degrade the device performance. Thus, {{it is clear that the}} effects poly gate depletion and/or remote Coulomb scattering are unavoidable in conventionally doped gate CMOS devices. To reduce poly gate depletion and remote Coulomb scattering, the gate depletion should be completely eliminated. Metal gates provide a possible solution to eliminate poly gate depletion completely but the integration of metal gates is difficult. In order to reduce the poly gate depletion effects, an alternative <b>gate</b> <b>doping</b> scheme, where the gate is inversely doped is proposed in this work. With inversely doped gates the poly gate depletion is eliminated selectively when the device is turned on. The gate in conventional CMOS devices is generally of the same type as that of the source/drain, i. e., the NMOSFET has a n-gate and the PMOSFET has a p-gate. In an alternative <b>gate</b> <b>doping</b> scheme, the n-gate of the NMOSFET is replaced with a p-gate and vice versa for a PMOSFET. As a result, the gate is driven into accumulation when the device is turned on, thus retaining the gate capacitance at its maximum possible value of oxide capacitance. As the gate capacitance is retained at its maximum value, the device performance improves. The concept of alternative <b>gate</b> <b>doping</b> was verified by fabricating suitable hardware. Through extensive simulation studies, the concept of alternate <b>gate</b> <b>doping</b> was investigated in detail. Further simulations suggested that the concept can even be implemented in silicon on insulator devices. The simulation results suggested that the device performance can be improved significantly, thus allowing the use of poly gates even in sub 100 nm regime...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{influence}} of the <b>gate</b> <b>doping</b> type of the MOS var-actor on frequency tuning, phase noise, and frequency sensitivity to supply-voltage variations of a fully integrated inductance-capac-itance voltage-controlled oscillator (LC-VCO) is presented. Three varactors in multifinger layout with shallow trench isolation (STI) are compared. The polysilicon gate is either entirely n- or p-doped or the fingers have alternating n and p doping. Differences in ca-pacitance and quality factor are shown. Two identical VCOs with the varactors having n gates or np gates are realized. Homogenous doping increases the VCO tuning range to 1. 31 GHz (20 %) in comparison to 1. 06 GHz (15 %) obtained by mixed doping. How-ever, mixed doping has the advantages of more linear VCO fre-quency tuning, lower close-in phase noise, and reduced maximum sensitivity to variations in supply voltage. Several varactor param-eters are introduced. They allow prediction of the {{influence of}} var-actors on the performance of a given VCO.

40|$|Abstract—Aggressive {{scaling of}} MOS devices {{requires}} use of ultra-thin gate oxides {{to maintain a}} reasonable short channel effect and to take the advantage of higher density, high speed, lower cost etc. Such thin oxides give rise to high electric fields, resulting in considerable gate tunneling current through gate oxide in nano regime. Consequently, accurate analysis of gate tunneling current is very important especially in context of low power application. In this paper, a simple and efficient analytical model has been developed for channel and source/drain overlap region gate tunneling current through ultra thin gate oxide n-channel MOSFET with inevitable deep submicron effect (DSME). The results obtained have been verified with simulated and reported experimental results {{for the purpose of}} validation. It is shown that the calculated tunnel current is well fitted to the measured one over the entire oxide thickness range. The proposed model is suitable enough to be used in circuit simulator due to its simplicity. It is observed that neglecting deep sub-micron effect may lead to large error in the calculated gate tunneling current. It is found that temperature has almost negligible effect on gate tunneling current. It is also reported that gate tunneling current reduces with the increase of gate oxide thickness. The impact of source/drain overlap length is also assessed on gate tunneling current.

40|$|Radiation {{detectors}} {{are used}} in a large variety of fields such as medicine, security, defense, geophysics, industry and physics. They {{have been developed to}} detect the energy or position of radiation or charge particles. In Chapter 1 several X-ray detectors were introduced briefly. In gas filled X-ray detectors, incoming photons ionize inert gas and create electron and ions which can be collected at a thin wire anode inside of the chamber. The advantage of this type of detector is the possibility to amplify the signal or charge, hence a high signal to noise ratio. However, they suffer from low efficiency for X-ray detection due to low density of the filled gas. In scintillation detectors, X-ray photons collide with the scintillator and create UV or visible light which can be converted into an electrical signal by a photodiode. The main disadvantage of scintillation detectors is their poor energy resolution due to a large amount of loss, and the relatively high ionization energy, i. e. 20 - 500 eV. In semiconductor detectors, electron and hole pairs (EHPs) can be generated at much lower energies than gas filled detectors. The possibility to measure both position and energy of incoming radiation accurately is a unique property for semiconductor detectors. However, they do not have any intrinsic signal gain, {{as is the case in}} gas filled detectors. Therefore an integrated or external amplifier is required for this type of detector. When selecting semiconductor materials, higher density, a higher atomic number for better absorption efficiency, lower bandgap for better resolution, higher mobility for fast detection beside lower leakage current, and a thicker substrate should be considered. Among different semiconductor materials, silicon is an interesting material for X-ray detectors because of the availability of fabrication process technology, lower cost and possibility to integrate advanced electronic circuits and further signal processing. PIN photodiodes made in a high resistivity silicon substrate are the simplest, cheapest, commercially available type of X-ray detectors where the full thickness of silicon is depleted by reverse bias to extract the generated EHPs with radiation. However, PIN detectors have a large anode area which makes the output capacitance so large that higher noise level in the output is the result. In Si(Li) and Ge(Li) detectors, crystals of silicon or germanium are used with thicknesses in the range of a few mm to cm. To obtain intrinsic material (concentration levels as low as 109 cm- 3) for complete thickness, a Li drifting process is used where Li acts as a donor to compensate acceptor ions. The typical biasing voltage is 500 V to 4000 V. In order to prevent redistribution of the Li atoms, the detector has to be kept at a low temperature with liquid nitrogen, which is the main disadvantage for this type of detector. Silicon strip detectors offer 2 D position sensitive detection. They are similar to PIN diodes, but the p+ region is divided into many strips on the front side to collect the holes, and the n+ region is divided into many n+ strips on the backside to collect the electrons. In silicon pixel detectors (SPDs) only one side of p+n is patterned and every pixel has its own readout electronics attached to the pixel by solder bumping. In p-n CCDs the drift function is carried out by reverse and forward biases of p-n junctions in periodic cycles by external pulses acting as series of shift registers drifting the electrons toward the anode. Silicon drift detectors (SDDs) are detectors with an extremely small anode and low output capacitance, thus less noise and high energy resolution. In a circular configuration the p+ drift rings create an electric field parallel to the surface to collect the electrons in the small anode region. Independent of the active area of the detector, a typical output capacitance of an SDD is in the range of 60 fF. On-chip electronic devices are placed on the front side to amplify the signal. In the Silicon Drift Detector Droplet (SD³) the anode and integrated transistor are moved to the margin of the structure where they can be shielded from direct radiation by a proper collimator. This has a significant effect on the low energy background in the SDD. With the SD³ the peak/background ratio is increased from 3000 to 5000. Multichannel SDDs consist of many single SDDs with individual readout but a common entrance window, guard ring and supply voltage where the sensitive area is very big, up to few cm 2, without losing the energy resolution and count rate capability of the single SDD. Finally in 3 D detectors implanted electrodes of conventional SDD are replaced with a 3 D array of p+ and n+ electrodes inside the silicon. In 3 D detectors collection distances and times are about one order of magnitude less than planar strips and pixel detectors, and the depletion voltage is about two orders of magnitude lower. However, the fabrication process is complex and expensive. In Chapter 2 the properties of the boron layer were described in detail. A boron layer is deposited in an ASM Epsilon reactor using Diborane (B 2 H 6) and Hydrogen as a dopant gas and carrier gas at temperatures ranging from 500 oC to 700 oC. The typical thickness of the boron layer deposited at 700 oC for a 7 min deposition time is equal to a 2 - 3 nm uniform layer. Deposition at lower temperatures results in a non-uniform boron layer which is confirmed by TEM analysis. Fabricated PureB diodes behave like a conventional deep p+-n junction with near ideal ideality factors lower than ? 1. 02, and low saturation current. Resistors are key elements in integrated circuits and can be made with a p-n junction or by poly silicon deposition. However, drawbacks for these two technologies are bias dependence, high parasitic capacitance for high Ohmic values in junction made resistors, and large variation and process dependency for poly-made resistors. The typical sheet resistance value of the deposited boron layer is in the 100 k?/? range which can be changed by deposition time, temperature and annealing. In this thesis, the photodiodes were fabricated on high-resistivity Si (HRS) wafers, n-type phosphorous-doped to 2 - 10 k?-cm. The resistors were also placed directly in the HRS so that associated depletion layers were tens of microns wide even at 0 V biasing. Thus the voltage dependence of the resistance value is negligible. The fabrication process consisted of oxidation followed by etching, boron layer deposition and finally metallization. To remove Al from the top of the boron layer, a combination of dry etching and short wet etching in diluted HF was used. The sheet resistance values extracted from measurement of the ring structures are 2. 5 × 104 ?/? for a 7 min 700 oC deposition and 3. 8 × 105 ?/? for a 20 min 500 oC deposition. Fabricated resistors show high linearity in voltage ranges between 10 V and 100 V and are stable in temperature ranges from 15 °C to 95 °C. The 500 oC resistors have a TCR (temperature coefficient of the resistor) less than 200 ppm/oC up to a measurement temperature of 70 oC, then increasing to around 1000 ppm/oC at 95 oC. The TCR of the 700 oC sample had an almost constant value of less than 400 ppm/oC over the whole measurement temperature range. The measured leakage current was less than 1 nA/cm 2 at 10 V reverse bias over all dies of the 100 mm wafer. The measured resistor tolerance was in the range of 1 % to 5 % for both k? and M? resistors. Since Pure Al can short the shallow junctions to bulk especially when the boron layer is deposited at lower temperatures (non-uniform boron layer) or when there is a defect on the substrate, an alloy of AlSi (1 % Si) is used. However, removing AlSi with a wet process is not compatible with the boron layer process. Therefore it is better to add a diffusion barrier layer between the Al and boron layer. Among different studied diffusion barrier layers such as Ti, TiN, AlN and ZrN, only ZrN showed better process compatibility and no influence on the electrical performance of the detectors. Optical and SEM inspections show a defect-free detector surface when using 10 nm ZrN between the Al and boron layer for both the 700 oC and 500 oC deposited layers. As an alternative, a lift-off process was developed to prevent any Al residuals on the boron layer. After PureB layer deposition at 700 oC or 500 oC, a negative photoresist (AZ®nLOF) was applied and patterned followed by 400 nm-thick Al layer deposition by evaporation. Then the resist was stripped in acetone or a NMP solution in an ultrasonic bath. For both PureB layers deposited at 700 oC or 500 oC, the lift-off process was successfully performed. However, the limitation of Al thickness and the deposition method (evaporation) can be a challenge for some applications. In Chapter 3 the working principle of SDDs was reviewed. They have a higher count rate and better energy resolution with respect to other X-ray detectors. In order to have a successful working detector, different aspects of SDDs must be selected, designed and simulated carefully. The starting material for SDDs is high-Ohmic silicon wafers due to a better carrier lifetime (in the order of milliseconds) and lower required voltage for full depletion. To obtain better wafer uniformity typically wafers are made with the Neutron Transmutation Doped (NTD) method where uniformity of the phosphorus doping is achieved by exposing an ingot of high-purity silicon to a uniform flux of thermal neutrons. For detection of higher energies, thicker wafers should be used. Furthermore, a silicon substrate has a higher charge collection efficiency (CCE) of soft X-rays (below 200 nm wavelengths) and has a lower surface leakage current compared to the orientation. The entrance window of the detector determines the lowest energy the detector can detect. In SDDs the entrance window is kept in a vacuum by using Beryllium or polymer windows. Those windows can limit the lower range of detectable X-rays. In TEM systems a very high vacuum condition exists, thus those windows are not required. Therefore the lower detectable range can be reduced. In order to detect even lower X-rays energies (few hundred eVs), the dead layer of the p+ region in the entrance window should be as thin as possible, i. e. a shallow junction is required. A typical dead layer of 40 nm by implantation is reported. To keep full depletion in the center of detector, the entrance window is biased at Vdep which corresponds to a depletion voltage of the full wafer thickness. In the outer drift ring the applied voltage is equal to 2 Vdep to ensure enough drift potential for the electrons towards the anode. Leakage current is a very important parameter in the SDDs which defines noise level. Bulk leakage current can be reduced by selecting a high quality wafer and lowering the process temperature. Surface generation leakage current can originate from processing defects and interface states generated in the bandgap region near the surface by abrupt discontinuity in the silicon interface. A sink anode is a structure to reduce the surface leakage current by providing a path to drain away the surface electrons through the p+ field electrodes. In order to improve the energy resolution as much as possible, total capacitances including anode capacitance and stray capacitance (connection path to the external circuit), should be equal to the input capacitance of the external amplifier. A guard ring structure maintains low leakage current for the SDD without any breakdown at high voltage biases for depletion and drift mechanisms. The entrance window can be made from a PureB layer which has only a 2 nm-thick dead layer for the p+ layer. Therefore measuring lower energies (as low as 100 eV) should be possible. Furthermore, PureB made resistors can be used as voltage dividers in the drift region of the detectors. A continuous layer of boron can act as a distributed resistor to drift the electrons toward the anode. However, calculations and simulations showed one layer of boron cannot generate enough electric field to drift the electrons. The inner part has a higher resistance than outer part; therefore the electric field is concentrated only in the center of the detector and there is no force on the electrons to drift them to the anode. For the designed detector with an inner radius of 135 ?m and outer ring radius of 3135 ?m using the boron layer with a sheet resistance value of 105 ?/?, the total resistance between the contact pads is equal to 50 k?. Yet 95 % of this value is concentrated only in a 135 ?m to 500 ?m region of the detector. The electric field is around three orders of magnitude less in the outer ring thus it is only effective at the inner side of the detector; there is not enough electric field to move the electrons toward the anode in the outer sides of the detector. Potential distribution shows at a 40 V applied voltage, electrons will be accumulated in the gutter, the minimum of the potential energy, and will be moved slowly to the anode. At 160 V, the drift voltage slope along the detector surface is lightly sharper than the 40 V case but still too small to drift the electrons toward the anode. Therefore around 80 % of the drift area has an almost zero electric field. However, a dual boron layer with two different sheet resistances and a special design can create a constant electric field in the drift region while the leakage current is still low. In this design the whole surface covered with two layers of boron to have minimum leakage current where the low sheet resistance layer is denser near the anode, and the high sheet resistance layer is denser in the outer rings to produce a constant resistance and electric field over the drift area. Chapter 4 describes designing a guard ring structure and integrating an on-chip amplifier for SDDs where there is no multiplication mechanism. Consequently an on-chip or off-chip amplifier is necessary. With on-chip amplification, undesirable interference effects related to wire bonding, such as stray capacitance and microphonic noise, can be avoided. To select the type of transistor for the SDD, a JFET is preferred because of noise considerations. Bipolar transistors have higher shot noise and CMOS transistors have a higher 1 /f noise component. In designing the JFET there is a trade-off between obtaining minimum noise and minimum capacitance while keeping the transconductance (gm) as high as possible. Gate capacitance plays an important role in this trade-off. Since mobility of an nFET is higher, it offers a higher cut-off frequency than a pFET. For optimum SDD resolution, input capacitance of the JFET is equal to detector’s capacitance. In a SDD typically the JFET is placed inside the anode, which is isolated by a p-type region. The anode is connected to the gate, in the common source configuration the drain is connected to the power supply, and the source is connected to the external circuit. Accumulated charges on the anode can be discharged by reset devices such as a diode, JFET or MOSFET. Availability of technology and layout compatibility, minimum added noise and maximum linearity determine the choice of the reset transistor. In this thesis two types of on-chip JFET structures with a 4. 5 ?m gate length together with different reset devices were designed for SDDs. The reset devices were embedded either in the JFET or in the small anode region. The parasitic capacitor between the detector anode and the transistor guard ring can act as a feedback capacitor. In the fabrication process flow, in order to find the optimum implantation parameters (energy and dose) for the gate (p+), S/D (n+) and deep n- and deep p-regions, two different routes were investigated. For <b>gate</b> <b>doping,</b> a combination of boron implantation and boron layer deposition was used. Moreover in this chapter designing multi-guard ring structures was discussed. According to electrical measurements at different temperatures, a positive temperature coefficient for the breakdown voltage was found, which means the breakdown mechanism is an avalanche type. To prevent breakdown, several multi-guard ring structures were studied. Multi-guard ring structures consist of a conventional large p-type guard (240 ?m width), a series of intermediate concentric circular p-type guard rings (with different pitches, widths and metal overlap of the field plate), and a large n+-type guard (150 ?m width) near the scribing line. The function of the n+ guard ring is to shield any existing positive charges in the oxide and prevent extension of depletion region toward the dicing line. As a result, the leakage current drops significantly. In this structure, parameters such as gap size, oxide charge, bulk doping concentration and field plate (metal extension) design have influence on the potential distribution of the guard rings. One of the designed structures works up to the limit of the measurement systems (1100 V) with very low leakage current in the range of 1. 5 - 3 nA/cm 2. In this structure the width of the guard rings was 25 ?m, the first gap (between the large guard and first intermediate guard ring) was 35 ?m, and the pitch was 80 ?m for the rest of the rings, with an inward field plate extending 5 - 30 ?m. Other structures show a roughly 400 V breakdown voltage. According to the measurements of different designed guard ring structures, a gap of around 40 ?m is an optimal value for the distance between the large guard ring and first ring of the multi-guard structure. Moreover, it was found that a field plate in the inward direction offers a higher breakdown voltage because of charge shielding. In Chapter 5 the fabrication process and characterization results of SDDs were discussed. Since processing is performed on both sides of the wafers, special care should be considered during the processing steps such as wafer handling, implantation and wet etching in order to prevent any damage to the other side of the wafer. Furthermore, since the carrier lifetime is very important in SDD performance, high temperature processing steps should be avoided as much as possible. Therefore activation of dopants, particularly in case of JFET integration, at lower temperatures can be a challenge. In general a typical fabrication process flow starts with dry oxidation followed by guard ring and anode implantations by boron and phosphorous dopants. The next step is TEOS oxide deposition and annealing. Then the oxide layer is etched to open the regions for boron deposition to create p+ regions. Boron deposition is selective which means it deposits only on silicon. Al metallization on both sides is the next step. In order to etch Al and expose the boron layer a combination of dry (keeping the dimensions same as the design) and wet etching in diluted HF (to land on the boron layer without damaging it) is performed. Alloying in forming gas is the last step to create Ohmic contact of doped silicon with Al. For the double boron layer process flow, two reticles (litho steps) are used before boron deposition. Using the first litho step, oxide was etched in the drift region to leave a 30 nm-thick oxide. With the second litho step, a 30 nm-thick oxide was etched from low sheet resistance areas. A low sheet resistance boron layer was deposited and followed by a 10 sec BHF step to etch a 30 nm-thick oxide from the rest of drift region. The previously deposited boron layer is not attacked by this short BHF step. At the end, high sheet resistance boron layer was deposited. In the process flow for JFET integration there are several implantation steps for deep p, deep n, S/D and gate regions. Fabricated wafers were subjected to electrical measurement to characterize the wafer quality and fabricated SDDs. Measurement and calculation of the doping profile from CV curves result in 144. 5 µm and 217. 5 µm depletion depths on the entrance window side and device side of the silicon wafer, respectively. This measurement reveals that the entrance window (front side) of the wafer has a lower resistivity than the device side (backside). Knowledge of the bulk generation lifetime (?g) and surface generation velocity (sg) of the wafer is essential for process control and radiation-damage monitoring in radiation detectors. Using the designed gated diode structures, ?g and sg can be extracted. The gate area (Ag) is 0. 3 mm 2 - 1. 5 mm 2 with a gate length (Lg) of 95 - 470 ?m. During the measurement, the diode is kept at a constant reverse voltage (Vd) while the changes of the diode current are monitored when the gate is swept from accumulation toward the inversion. I-V measurement was done on 12 samples for each gate length, then using the bulk and surface generation currents and depletion region formulas, ?g and sg were extracted. The average value of the bulk generation lifetime was 40 ms and surface generation velocity was 2. 1 cm/s for the fabricated wafers. Furthermore, the boron layer is used as a voltage divider between the inner and outer rings. The resistors made with 500 oC and 700 oC PureB layers are stable in different locations in the wafer with a maximum tolerance of 1. 7 % over the wafer for high temperature samples compared to 4. 9 % for low temperature samples. The resistors made with implantation in general have more fluctuation over the wafer. The calculated value of the tolerance for resistors made with implantation is 30 % (only working devices were considered) while for resistors made with 500 oC PureB it is only 4. 9 % (all devices were working). A thicker passivation layer leads to a lower leakage current. For boron layer SDDs there is no difference in the leakage current between oven and Epsilon annealing suggesting a lower thermal budget process using an Epsilon reactor with a very short time.

With an aim {{to build}} a general theory for {{superconductivity}} in doped band insulators we focuss on 2 family, discovered by Mizuguchi et al. in 2012. While maximum Tc is only ∼ 11 K in, a number of experimental results are puzzling and anomalous; they resemble high Tc and unconventional superconductors. Using a two orbital model of Usui, Suzuki and Kuroki we show that the uniform low density free fermi sea in is unstable towards formation of next nearest neighbor Bi-S-Bi diagonal valence bond (charge - 2 e Cooper pair) and their Wigner crystallization. Instability to this novel state of matter is caused by unscreened nearest neighbor coulomb repulsions (V ∼ 1 eV) and a hopping pattern with sulfur mediated diagonal next nearest neighbor Bi-S-Bi hopping t' ∼ 0. 88 eV, larger than nearest neighbor Bi-Bi hopping, t ∼ 0. 16 eV. Wigner crystal of Cooper pairs quantum melt for doping around x = 0. 5 and stabilize certain resonating valence bond states and superconductivity. We study few variational RVB states and suggest that 2 family members are latent high Tc superconductors, but challenged by competing orders and fragile nature of manybody states sustained by unscreened Coulomb forces. One of our superconducting state has d_xy symmetry and a gap. We also predict 2 d Bose metal or vortex liquid normal state, as charge - 2 e valence bonds survive in the normal state.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the sign {{and magnitude of}} the single-molecule Seebeck coefficient of naphthalenediimide (NDI) {{under the influence of}} electrochemical <b>gating</b> and <b>doping.</b> The molecule consists of a NDI core with two alkyl chains in the bay-area position, connected to gold electrodes via benzothiophene (DBT) anchor groups. By switching between the neutral, radical and di-anion charge states, we are able to tune the molecular energy levels relative to the Fermi energy of the electrodes. The resulting single-molecule room-temperature Seebeck coefficents of the three charge states are - 294. 5 μV K(- 1), 122 μV K(- 1) and 144 μV K(- 1) respectively and the room-temperature power factors are 4. 4 × 10 (- 5) W m(- 1) K(- 2), 3 × 10 (- 5) W m(- 1) K(- 2) and 8. 2 × 10 (- 4) W m(- 1) K(- 2). As a further strategy for optimising thermoelectric properties, we also {{investigate the}} effect on both phonon and electron transport of doping the NDI with either an electron donor (TTF) or an electron acceptor (TCNE). We find that doping by TTF increases the room-temperature Seebeck coefficient and power factor from - 73. 7 μV K(- 1) and 2. 6 × 10 (- 7) W m(- 1) K(- 2) for bare NDI to - 105 μV K(- 1) and 3. 6 × 10 (- 4) W m(- 1) K(- 2) in presence of TTF. The low thermal conductance of NDI-TTF, combined with the higher Seebeck coefficient and higher electrical conductance lead to a maximum thermoelectric figure of merit of ZT = 1. 2, which is higher than that of bare NDI in several orders of magnitude. This demonstrates that both the sign and magnitude of NDI Seebeck coefficient can be tuned reversibly by electrochemical <b>gating</b> and <b>doping,</b> suggesting that such redox active molecules are attractive materials for ultra-thin-film thermoelectric devices...|$|R
