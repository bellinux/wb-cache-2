5|$|The Pizza Burger is {{a burger}} sold {{exclusively}} at the BK Whopper Bar location in Times Square, New York City that {{was introduced in}} September 2010. It consists of four Whopper patties on a 9.5inch sesame bun, sliced into six pieces and topped with pepperoni, mozzarella, basil pesto and marinara sauce. The whole burger contains more than the recommended <b>daily</b> <b>allowance</b> of calories for men at 2,520 calories, with 144grams of fat, 59g of which is saturated, and 3,780mg of sodium, {{more than double the}} recommended <b>daily</b> <b>allowance</b> for adults. However, according to Burger King's Vice President of global marketing, John Schaufelberger, the burger is not intended to feed just one person. Each slice has 420 calories, 24g fat (10g saturated), and 630mg sodium.|$|E

5|$|No. 4 Commando {{was formed}} in Weymouth on 21 July 1940, when the first intake of 500 volunteers arrived. The unique nature of the commandos {{immediately}} became apparent when every man was held responsible for finding his own quarters. As commandos {{were expected to be}} fighting troops, they had no administrative personnel, such as clerks and cooks for example. To assist them with living 'off camp', with no cook house all ranks were given a <b>daily</b> <b>allowance</b> and a ration card, the allowance being 67 pence for officers and of 34 pence for other ranks. This arrangement meant that commandos lived on civilian rations, {{while the rest of the}} armed forces had the more plentiful military scale of rations.|$|E

40|$|Recommended <b>daily</b> <b>allowances,</b> U. S. A., for {{ascorbic acid}} are several times the minimum daily {{requirement}} of about 10 mg to prevent clinical symptoms in adults. The recommended <b>daily</b> <b>allowances</b> reflect {{the levels of}} ascorbic acid required to produce tissue saturation in human beings, so that higher doses are promptly excreted in the urine. In various investigations, responses to ascorbic acid were not obtained under conditions where the intake was considerably lower than the recommended <b>daily</b> <b>allowances,</b> but higher than the level needed to prevent clinical symptoms of ascorbic acid deficiency. The human ascorbic acid requirement cannot be calculated by a linear extrapolation from guinea pigs per kg of body weight because guinea pigs are much smaller than human beings and, hence, their metabolism is more rapid per unit of body weight.

25|$|I defend {{absolutely}} Mr Farage's {{right to}} disagree about the policy or {{institutions of the}} Union, but not to personally insult our guests in the European Parliament or the country from which they may come... I myself fought for free speech as the absolute cornerstone of a democratic society. But with freedom comes responsibility– in this case, to respect the dignity of others and of our institutions. I am disappointed by Mr Farage's behaviour, which sits ill with the great parliamentary tradition of his own country. I cannot accept this sort of behaviour in the European Parliament. I invited him to apologise, but he declined to do so. I have therefore– {{as an expression of}} the seriousness of the matter– rescinded his right to ten days' <b>daily</b> <b>allowance</b> as a Member.|$|E

Rising incomes in China {{have not}} lead to a smaller degree of {{undernutrition}} as measured by percent of population below calorie and protein recommended <b>daily</b> <b>allowances</b> (RDA).

25|$|The revolt {{started on}} January 10, 1923. Arriving with trains to Kretinga and Tauragė, 1,090 volunteers (40 officers, 584 soldiers, 455 riflemen, 3 clerks, 2 doctors, 6 orderlies) {{crossed the border}} into the region. Among them were Steponas Darius and Vladas Putvinskis. They wore {{civilian}} clothes and had green armband with letters MLS for Mažosios Lietuvos sukilėlis or Mažosios Lietuvos savanoris (rebel/volunteer of Lithuania Minor). Each man had a rifle and 200 bullets; the rebels had a total of 21 light machine guns, 4 motorcycles, 3 cars, 63 horses. In hopes to negotiate a peaceful retreat of the French and to avoid any casualties, shooting was allowed {{only as a last}} resort of self-defense. Galvanauskas ordered perfect behavior (politeness, no plunder, no alcoholic drinks, no political speeches) and no Lithuanian identification (no Lithuanian documents, money, tobacco, or matchboxes). In the Klaipėda Region, these men were met by some 300 local volunteers, though Lithuanian historian Vygandas Vareikis disputed the accuracy of this assertion. More local men joined once the rebels reached cities. The rebels met little resistance, but struggled with cold winter weather, lack of transportation and basic supplies (they were not provided with food or clothes, but were given a <b>daily</b> <b>allowance</b> of 4000 German marks).|$|E
25|$|The first Tour de France {{was staged}} in 1903. The plan was a five-stage race from 31 May to 5 July, {{starting}} in Paris and stopping in Lyon, Marseille, Bordeaux and Nantes {{before returning to}} Paris. Toulouse was added later to break the long haul across southern France from the Mediterranean to the Atlantic. Stages would go {{through the night and}} finish next afternoon, with rest days before riders set off again. But this proved too daunting and the costs too great for most and only 15 competitors had entered. Desgrange had never been wholly convinced and he came close to dropping the idea. Instead, he cut the length to 19 days, changed the dates to 1 to 19 July, and offered a <b>daily</b> <b>allowance</b> to those who averaged at least 20km/h on all the stages, equivalent to what a rider would have expected to earn each day had he worked in a factory. He also cut the entry fee from 20 to 10 francs and set the first prize at 12,000 francs and the prize for each day's winner at 3,000 francs. The winner would thereby win six times what most workers earned in a year. That attracted between 60 and 80 entrants– the higher number may have included serious inquiries and some who dropped out– among them not just professionals but amateurs, some unemployed, some simply adventurous.|$|E
