40|$|The {{development}} of nuclear-pumped, liquid-based lanthanide <b>ion</b> <b>lasers</b> is discussed. Early investigations of lanthanide <b>ion</b> <b>lasers</b> have lead to solid-state and gaseous neodymium lasers, and {{a demonstration of}} lasing in the liquid state.

5000|$|An <b>ion</b> <b>laser</b> is a {{gas laser}} that uses an ionized gas as its lasing medium. Like other gas lasers, ion lasers feature a sealed cavity {{containing}} the laser medium and mirrors forming a Fabry-Pérot resonator. Unlike helium-neon lasers, the energy level transitions {{that contribute to}} laser action come from ions. Because of {{the large amount of}} energy required to excite the ionic transitions used in ion lasers, the required current is much greater, and as a result all but the smallest ion lasers are water-cooled. A small air-cooled <b>ion</b> <b>laser</b> might produce, for example, 130 mW of light with a tube current of 10 A at 105 V. This is a total power draw over 1 kW, which translates into a large amount of heat that must be dissipated.|$|E

Their tubes are usually made from nickel end bells, kovar metal-to-ceramic seals, beryllium oxide ceramics, or tungsten disks mounted on a copper heat spreader in a ceramic liner. The earliest tubes were simple quartz, followed by quartz with graphite disks. In comparison with the helium-neon lasers that require just a few milliamperes, the current used for pumping the krypton laser is several amperes, as the gas has to be ionized.

50|$|Treatment for optic pit-associated macular {{detachment}} involves photocoagulation of {{the retina}} {{by use of}} an <b>ion</b> <b>laser</b> (either krypton or argon).
