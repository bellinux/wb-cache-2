5|$|The {{location}} of castles {{in relation to}} high status features, such as fish ponds, was a statement of power and control of resources. Also often found near a castle, sometimes within its defences, was the parish church. This signified a close relationship between feudal lords and the Church, {{one of the most}} important institutions of medieval society. Even elements of castle architecture that have usually been interpreted as military could be used for display. The water features of Kenilworth Castle in England– comprising a moat and several satellite ponds– forced anyone approaching a water castle entrance to take a very indirect route, walking around the defences before the final approach towards the gateway. Another example is that of the 14th-century Bodiam Castle, also in England; although it appears to be a state of the art, advanced castle it is in a site of little strategic importance, and the moat was shallow and more likely intended to make the site appear impressive than as a defence against mining. The approach was long and took the viewer around the castle, ensuring they <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> before entering. Moreover, the gunports were impractical and unlikely to have been effective.|$|E

Police recovered unidentified fingerprints on and inside Heitholt's car as well as an unidentified hair in his hand. Police also recovered footprints in the blood at the crime scene. Ornt gave police a description of the men and a composite sketch was made.|$|E
25|$|Dominic Kinnear {{states that}} the first time the Earthquakes {{coaching}} staff first <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at Brian Ching was facing him in the July 17, 2002 third round match of the U.S. Open Cup when San Jose defeated the Seattle Sounders 4-3 after sudden death extra time. Kinnear, assistant coach at the time, and head coach Frank Yallop were impressed with how Ching matched up with Earthquakes defender Eddie Robinson, considered one of the best defenders in MLS at the time. Ching began training with the Earthquakes the following January. On February 11, 2003, San Jose traded Devin Barclay to D.C. United in exchange for the first overall pick in the 2003 MLS Supplemental Draft and on February 28, 2013, they used that pick to draft Ching.|$|E

I must 'a' been clear dead and gone {{for as much as}} a minute or more; then I come to, and Tom had hitched a boat-hook on to the lower lip of the giant and was holding the balloon steady with it whilst he canted his head back and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> long <b>look</b> up at that awful face.|$|R
5000|$|Martin Ralph (born 18 January 1960) is an Australian sprint canoeist who {{competed in}} the mid-1980s. At the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles, he was {{eliminated}} in the repechages of the K-2 500 m event. Subsequently, he began to coach with the VIS(Victorian Institute of Sport) and independently. Martin received the Australian Sports Medal from the Prime Minister and the Governor General for sporting achievement in the year 2000. Often asked if he {{won a gold medal}} Martin replies, [...] "I didn't come first and I didn't come last but I <b>got</b> <b>a</b> real <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at the bloke who did!" ...|$|R
500|$|Roland Kickinger as The Terminator / T-800 (Model 101): {{the first}} Terminator covered in living tissue. Bodybuilder and actor Kickinger, who {{previously}} portrayed Schwarzenegger in the 2005 biographical film See Arnold Run, was his physical double on set. When {{asked about his}} role, Kickinger said it is [...] "Arnold's character in the first Terminator. That's basically my role, but 20 years before, so it establishes how the Terminator came about." [...] Polish strongman athlete Mariusz Pudzianowski was also considered for doubling Schwarzenegger. If Schwarzenegger {{had decided not to}} lend his appearance to the film, then John would have shot the T-800s face off before the audience <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at him.|$|E
2500|$|He {{was first}} arrested on 8 November 1973 {{for the killing}} on 28 October of Patrick Campbell, a Catholic trade unionist from Banbridge who was gunned down on his doorstep. Jackson's words after {{he was charged with}} the killing were: [...] "Nothing. I just can't believe it". Campbell's wife, Margaret had {{opened the door to the}} gunman and his {{accomplice}} when they had come looking for her husband. She had <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at the two men, who drove off in a Ford Cortina after the shooting, and although she identified Jackson as the killer at an identity parade, murder charges against him were dropped on 4 January 1974 at Belfast Magistrates' Court.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the early}} days, Wolfman Jack made {{sporadic}} public appearances, usually as a Master of Ceremonies (an [...] "MC") for rock bands at local Los Angeles clubs. At each appearance {{he looked a}} little different because Smith had not decided what the Wolfman should look like. Early pictures show him with a goatee; however, sometimes he combed his straight hair forward and added dark makeup to look somewhat [...] "ethnic". Other times he had a big afro wig and large sunglasses. The ambiguity of his race contributed to the controversy of his program. It was not until he appeared in the 1969 film, A Session with the Committee (a montage of skits by the seminal comedy troupe The Committee), that mainstream America <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at Wolfman Jack.|$|E
5000|$|On May 20, 2017, the White Sox traded Katz to the Baltimore Orioles for two {{international}} pool {{signing bonus}} spots valued at over $750,000. [...] Orioles Executive Vice President Dan Duquette said of Katz: [...] "He has <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fastball and excellent strikeout record. A {{lot of guys}} like him and they project {{him to be a}} major league reliever. We’re going to send him to Frederick.... He showed <b>a</b> <b>good</b> fastball and <b>a</b> really <b>good</b> breaking ball in the Baseball Classic. We <b>got</b> <b>a</b> couple <b>good</b> <b>looks</b> at him." [...] At the time of the trade, Katz had struck out 10.1 batters per 9 innings in his 62-game, 102-inning minor league career.|$|R

5000|$|Upon {{reaching}} the city centre, Mulholland, {{according to one}} eyewitness, drove up the wrong way of a one-way street (Cathedral Street), thereby attracting attention. He then drove back down the same street and turned left into Marlborough Street where he proceeded towards Parnell Street. At about 17.12 he arrived at a parking bay in Parnell Street which was occupied by a married couple, Mortimer and Teresa O'Loughlin, who were just leaving. The latter <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good,</b> clear <b>look</b> at him. As soon as they pulled out, Mulholland moved into their space and parked the car bomb. This {{was close to the}} southwestern intersection with Marlborough Street, facing the direction of O'Connell Street. The green Avenger, hijacked that morning in Belfast, had reached its final destination in the parking bay outside the Welcome Inn pub and Barry's supermarket, with a butcher's shop and a petrol station, the Westbrook Motors Company, nearby. Mulholland then {{got out of the car}} and walked away.|$|R
2500|$|Ward, {{who first}} saw it, said, [...] "It {{looked more like}} an old broken-down suitcase. As soon as I got to it and <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look,</b> I knew exactly what it was." [...] McNief called the police from Ochsenbein's Grocery Store. Runnels investigated, with Deputy Sheriff Z. C. Henslee and {{officers}} Pete Carrara and Bill Bagwell. The music case {{was placed in a}} paste board box and returned to Chief Runnels's office. The saxophone was tarnished and the leather case's bottom and lining had deteriorated enough that pieces fell to the ground as it was placed in the box. A Texas High School emblem was also in the case, as well as sheet music for [...] "The Song of the Navy", probably played at the dance on the night of Booker's death.|$|E
2500|$|George Hutchinson was an {{unemployed}} labourer. On 12 November 1888, {{he made a}} formal statement to the London police {{that in the early}} hours of 9 November 1888, Mary Jane Kelly approached him in the street and asked him for money. He stated that he had then followed her and another man of conspicuous appearance to her room, and had watched the room for about three-quarters of an hour without seeing either leave. He gave a very detailed description of the man, claiming he was [...] "of Jewish appearance", despite the darkness of that night. The accuracy of Hutchinson's statement was disputed among the senior police. Inspector Frederick Abberline, after interviewing Hutchinson, believed that Hutchinson's account was truthful. However, Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness. Hutchinson's statement was made on the day that Mary Kelly's inquest was held, and he was not called to testify. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself, trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.|$|E
2500|$|Labourer George Hutchinson, {{who knew}} Kelly, {{reported}} that she met him at about 2:00a.m. and asked him for a loan of sixpence. He claimed to be broke and that as Kelly went on her way she was approached by a man of [...] "Jewish appearance". Hutchinson later gave the police an extremely {{detailed description of the}} man right down to the colour of his eyelashes despite it being the middle of a dark winter night. He reported that he overheard them talking in the street opposite the court where Kelly was living; Kelly complained of losing her handkerchief, and the man gave her a red one of his own. Hutchinson claimed that Kelly and the man headed for her room, that he followed them, and that he saw neither one of them again, laying off his watch at about 2:45. Hutchinson's statement appears to be partly corroborated by laundress Sarah Lewis, who reported seeing a man watching the entrance to Miller's Court as she passed into it at about 2:30 to spend the night with some friends, the Keylers. Hutchinson claimed that he was suspicious of the man because although Kelly seemed to know him, his opulent appearance made him seem very unusual in that neighbourhood, but only reported this to the police after the inquest on Kelly had been hastily concluded. Abberline, the detective in charge of the investigation, thought Hutchinson's information was important and sent him out with officers {{to see if he could}} see the man again. Hutchinson's name does not appear again in the existing police records, and so it is not possible to say with certainty whether his evidence was ultimately dismissed, disproven, or corroborated. In his memoirs Walter Dew discounts Hutchinson on the basis that his sighting may have been on a different day, and not the morning of the murder. Robert Anderson, head of the CID, later claimed that the only witness who <b>got</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>look</b> at the killer was Jewish. Hutchinson was not a Jew, and thus not that witness. Some modern scholars have suggested that Hutchinson was the Ripper himself, trying to confuse the police with a false description, but others suggest he may have just been an attention seeker who made up a story he hoped to sell to the press.|$|E
60|$|None had {{yet been}} made, and our two masters clambered {{up to the}} main hatch, and <b>got</b> as <b>good</b> <b>a</b> <b>look</b> {{at the state of}} things in the hold as could be thus obtained. So {{tremendous}} had been the pressure, that three of the deck beams were broken. They would have been driven quite clear of their fastenings, had not the wall of ice at each end prevented the possibility of such a thing. As it was, the top-timbers had slightly given way, and the seams must have opened just below the water-line. When the tide came in again, the schooner righted of course; and the opportunity was taken to pump her dry. There was then no leak; another proof that the defective places must be sought above the present water-line.|$|R
