5|$|Schaffer in Social Development (1996) {{suggests}} that the father–child relationship is primarily a cultural construction shaped by the requirements of each society.

5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, {{or if the}} far end of the line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies.

5|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{equivalence}} principle holds, gravity influences {{the passage of}} time. Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{considers}} the extended {{problem of the}} boundary layer flow over a flat plate or Blasius problem by considering a uniform free stream parallel to a static or moving flat plate. The plate is assumed to move <b>in</b> <b>the</b> same or <b>opposite</b> <b>directions</b> to <b>the</b> free stream. The governing partial differential equations are first transformed into an ordinary differential equation, before being solved numerically. Dual solutions are found to exist when the plate and the free stream move <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions...</b>|$|R

A {{comparison with the}} parabolic flat-band model of VQWR shows that both, the self-consistency and the nonparabolicity shift sub band edges, in some cases even <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>directions.</b> These shifts indicate that for an accurate description of inter sub band absorption, both effects {{have to be taken}} into the account...|$|R
5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants point to the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing. The barbs in the figure at the right are located at the Northern Hemisphere, because the wind is circling counter clock-wise around a low-pressure area at the Northern Hemisphere (the wind is blowing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> at the Southern Hemisphere, see also Buys Ballot's law).|$|E
5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction</b> along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap {{may be involved in}} the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of information that can be encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E

5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle is reached, at which point the steering may turn <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> <b>direction.</b> A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
