Studies in this field analyze the fundamental value of different forms <b>of</b> <b>collateral,</b> such as collateral in real estate, guarantees, etc. The fundamental value is measured by the proceeds ratio, which relates the realized proceeds to the original fundamental value assumed by the bank. Grunert (2010) analyzes potential factors influencing the proceeds ratio, based on a German data set consisting of 104 pieces <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> (<b>of</b> which 62 are collateral in real estate). The average proceeds ratio is 61  %, and the author concludes that the proceeds ratio fluctuates depending on the type <b>of</b> <b>collateral.</b> Franks et al.

The authors likewise conclude that the average proceeds ratio fluctuates depending on the type <b>of</b> <b>collateral.</b> Nevertheless, an above-average fundamental value <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> in real estate is pointed out.

40|$|The authors build a {{theoretical}} model that generates demand for collateral by Large Value Transfer System (LVTS) participants {{under the assumption}} that they minimize the cost of holding and managing collateral for LVTS purposes. The model predicts that the optimal amount <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> held by each LVTS participant depends on the opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>collateral,</b> the transactions costs of acquiring assets used as collateral and transferring them {{in and out of the}} LVTS, and the distribution of an LVTS participant's payment flows in the LVTS. The authors conclude that the aggregate amount <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> pledged to the LVTS is quite close to that predicted by the model, when benchmark values are used for opportunity and transactions costs that are based on anecdotal evidence, despite the fact that these costs are likely to vary among participants. If one LVTS participant that appears to face a lower opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> is excluded from the analysis, the model predicts an aggregate level <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> that is within 5 per cent of the amount actually held by LVTS participants, on average, between February 1999 and May 2003. The authors also apply panel-data regressions to the level <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> held in the LVTS. They find that the results are broadly supportive of the theoretical model. Sensitivity analysis of this model indicates that, when the opportunity cost <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> increases, the amount <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> that participants hold could be greatly reduced. ...|$|R

On the other hand, the use <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> is less likely in loans made to borrowers with longer relationship with the lender and in more concentrated credit markets. A higher risk free interest rate of the economy and a smaller size of the loan increase the likelihood that a loan will be totally secured with <b>collateral</b> instead <b>of</b> partially secured.

BACKGROUNDThere is limited information regarding the hemodynamic quantification <b>of</b> recruitable <b>collateral</b> vessels. METHODSAngiography <b>of</b> the donor coronary artery was performed before and during balloon coronary occlusion in 63 patients with one vessel disease. Patients were divided into groups of those with an absence <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> vessels (group 1, n = 10), those with recruitable collateral vessels (group 2, n = 23) and those with spontaneously visible collateral vessels (group 3, n = 30). During balloon inflation the coronary wedge/aortic pressure ratio (Pw/Pao) was determined as were collateral blood flow velocity variables, using a 0. 014 ″ Doppler guide wire. Myocardial ischemia was defined as ≥ 0. 1 mV ST-shift on a 12 lead electrocardiogram at 1 min coronary occlusion. RESULTSMyocardial ischemia was present in all patients of group 1, in 14 patients of group 2 and in 3 patients of group 3. Recruitable collateral flow without ischemia showed similar hemodynamic values as in group 3 while these values were similar to group 1 in regard to the presence <b>of</b> recruitable <b>collateral</b> vessels showing ischemia. Logistic regression analysis revealed both Pw/Pao and Vicolas independent predictors for the function <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> vessels.

We endeavoured to review the methods for coronary artery collateral assessment, the predictors and clini-cal importance <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> blood flow, {{and the potential for}} therapeutic augmentation <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> anastomoses. Methods and resultsWhile many methods have been used to assess collateral blood flow only a few have been formally validated. Collateral flow index, as determined by measurement of intra-coronary pressure or flow velocity, is the most robust measure <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> flow. These techniques have led to important advances in our understanding <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> artery function. Coronary collateral arteries may prevent myocardial ischaemia in healthy subjects and in patients with CHD. A functional collateral circulation may lead to reduced ischaemia, preservation of ventricular function, and an improved prog-nosis. Recent trials have demonstrated that vascular progenitor cell therapies may improve ventricular function following acute myocardial infarction, raising the possibility of effective biological treatments to improve myocardial blood flow and prognosis in CHD.

The goal of the thesis is to establish the configuration <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> policy as a tool of central bank policies in pursuit of different objectives, and to present collateral policies in practice, as well as impact and effects <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> policy. The thesis consists of three parts and nine chapters. The first part discusses the role <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> in central bank policy. Possible tasks and objectives of central banks are historically deduced in order to then integrate the configuration <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> policy into the system <b>of</b> objectives. <b>Collateral</b> policy emerges as of relevance towards all central bank objectives. As a result, a normative framework for the role <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> policy is developed. In the second part, practical collateral policy measures are presented along the lines of this framework. The focus is on the <b>collateral</b> policy <b>of</b> the Eurosystem, which is presented in detail. It has been intensified with respect to several central bank objectives throughout the financial and the European debt crisis. A comparison is made to historical collateral policy measures, as well as the configuration <b>of</b> the <b>collateral</b> frameworks at the Fed, the Bank of England and the Bank of Japan during the recent crisis years. The third part starts with a theoretical foundation of the impact and transmission process <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> policy within the system of objectives of a central bank. Collateral policy is therefore differentiated into haircut policy and quantity policy and contrasted to classical interest rate policy.

40|$|Objectives: Formation <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> {{circulation}} is an endogenous {{response to}} atherosclerosis, {{and is a}} natural escape mechanism by re-routing blood. Inflammatory responserelated genes underlie the formation <b>of</b> coronary <b>collaterals.</b> We explored the genetic basis <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> formation in man postulating interaction networks between functional Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) in these inflammatory gene candidates. Methods: The contribution of 41 genes {{as well as the}} interactions among them was examined in a cohort of 226 coronary artery disease patients, genotyped for 54 candidate SNPs. Patients were classified to the extent <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> circulation. Stepwise logistic regression analysis and a haplotype entropy procedure were applied to search for haplotype interactions among all 54 polymorphisms. Multiple testing was addressed by using the false discovery rate (FDR) method. Results: The population comprised 84 patients with and 142 without visible collaterals. Among the 41 genes, 16 pairs of SNPs were implicated in the development <b>of</b> <b>collaterals</b> with the FDR of 0. 19. Nine SNPs were found to potentially have main effects on collateral formation. Two sets of coupling haplotypes that predispose to collateral formation were suggested. Conclusions: These findings suggest that collateral formation may arise from the interactions between several SNPs in inflammatory response related genes, which may represent targets in future studies <b>of</b> <b>collateral</b> formation.
