500|$|Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 {{was given}} a 6 out of 10 by Newsarama's Richard Gray. He stated that [...] "despite the “Trinity War” tie-in banners, [...] {{scarcely}} essential reading for current DC fans" [...] adding that [...] "Pandora’s focus doesn’t appear to be as concerned with this bigger picture" [...] and the series {{requires a lot of}} backstory, only in its second issue. IGN's Jesse Schedeen gave the issue a 7.5 out of 10, commenting that [...] "Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 improves on the first issue, but the series still lacks a clear, ongoing purpose" [...] and [...] "as a [...] "Trinity War" [...] tie-in, this is certainly a more compelling read than Constantine #5." [...] Doug Zawisza of Comic Book Resources gave the issue 2 stars out of 5, saying [...] "Trinity of Sin: Pandora #2 is an average comic book all the way around. It doesn't add much to the [...] "Trinity War" [...] story despite the logo on the cover and it certainly isn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> with me until the next issue." ...|$|E
500|$|Mylod {{additionally}} {{spoke about}} filming the final {{scenes of the}} episode, the foot chase between Arya and the Waif, in the behind the scenes featurette published by HBO after the airing of the episode. Mylod stated that he did extensive research {{in order to create}} the foot chase, saying [...] "I devoured every foot chase in the history of cinema, but trying to take from that something that would fit into the blueprint of the Game of Thrones visual style, which is not necessarily the same kind of kinetic, handheld feel that you find in many contemporary thrillers. It's a much more classic frame." [...] He continued, [...] "Everything hinged from finding this very lovely, steep stairwell and thinking 'Wouldn't it be great if she leapt off that, and then tumbled down the stairs?' I had this image in my head that I wanted lots of oranges rolling down, not quite sure where that comes from, but it looked pretty." [...] Mylod also stated in a separate interview that it was a conscious decision not to show the final fight between Arya and the Waif, given that it took place in the dark, noting [...] "when the character dies in the dark, unless we switch on night-vision goggles, we're {{not going to be able}} to see that, and we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> around to hear a scream in the dark anyway. It was actually a conscious choice in the writing and I think, for me, a very elegant storytelling beat as to get that reveal a few seconds later." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sutter {{has said}} of the Shakespeare element, [...] "I don't want to overplay that but it's there. It was Jax's father who started the club, so he's the ghost in the action. You wonder {{what he would have}} made of the way it turned out. It's not a version of Hamlet but it's {{definitely}} influenced by it." [...] Ron Perlman believes [...] "they’re <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> to the structure of Hamlet {{all the way to the}} end (of the series)." ...|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Jennings told 'im {{not to make}} a fool of 'imself, and Charlie saw 'er look at Emma in {{a puzzled}} sort of way, as if she didn't know wot to make of it. She kept drawing away from 'im and he kept drawing close to 'er; other people on the {{pavement}} dodging and {{trying to get out of}} their way, and asking them which side they was <b>going</b> and <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|R
50|$|Beginners {{are first}} taught {{footwork}} (kaaladi) which they must master before learning spinning techniques and patterns, and methods {{to change the}} spins without stopping {{the motion of the}} stick. There are sixteen of them among which four are very important. Footwork patterns are the key aspects of silambam. Traditionally, the masters first teach kaaladi {{for a long time before}} proceeding to unarmed combat. Training empty-handed allows the practitioner to get a feel of silambam stick movements using their bare hands, that is, fighters have a preliminary training with bare hands before <b>going</b> <b>to</b> the <b>stick.</b>|$|R
50|$|Before the anti-rolling {{controller}} was introduced, {{the early}} revision of Type 91 aerial torpedo {{had a serious}} problem as other aerial torpedoes had in those days. Roughly released in high speed, it even made double-roll in the air. When it dove into the swelling waves of the heavy sea, it got spinning moment at the hard impact on water entry. It was veering the running direction, <b>going</b> down <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> {{the bottom of the}} shallow basin of a port, crashing at the depth limits 100m by the water pressure, jumping out of the water, skipping water surface, or even running backwards. Only the real razor aviators could make the sure torpedo-bombing run in the calm sea.|$|R
2500|$|In February 2003, it was {{confirmed}} that Steve McFadden {{would be taking}} a year hiatus. McFadden said: [...] "I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> my mechanic’s overalls in a locker while I {{take a look at a}} few other projects. EastEnders will always be No1 in my heart and I look forward to returning to Albert Square." [...] Executive producer Louise Berridge went on to say that she was [...] "looking forward to Steve returning in 2004". In July 2004, it was announced that McFadden had delayed his return. In February 2005, it {{was confirmed}} that McFadden would return. His return scenes aired in September 2005.|$|E
2500|$|The premiere drew mainly {{positive}} {{reviews from}} critics, with most to all complementing the new characters. Christine Petralia of Buddy TV said the premiere [...] "picks up right where last season left off and doesn't skip a beat. Frozen fans will be pumped {{that it looks}} like Elsa and Anna are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> around for a while as they search for answers about their parents' death. Meanwhile, a heartbroken Regina seeks out an old friend to help her [...] "change the book" [...] so she can finally get her happy ending. And as usual, Rumple can't seem to shake his obsession with power." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, {{we have a}} dozen left now, Dias, {{and when}} they burn out we must light two more and throw them over and trust to their burning as they lie among the stones. Of course we should not think of <b>going</b> down <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> them upright, for the scoundrels will {{probably}} be watching us as closely as we are watching them. However, I shall manage to keep the lights going till daybreak, and shall start a good hour before that. We shall {{have to go down}} cautiously, and I should like to be well away with the mules before they discover that we have left. Now, the sooner you are off the better. Breakfast has been ready for the past hour. You had better eat it and get under weigh as soon as you can. After you have gone one of us will keep watch while the other eats. I have no doubt there will be plenty left for our supper." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be depressed," [...] {{she cried}} perversely. [...] "I began {{a new system}} by <b>going</b> <b>to</b> that dance, and I mean <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> it. Clym can sing merrily; why should not I?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's so, but she's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{give him}} any more," [...] Wilkinson rejoined. [...] "He married Sadie for her money, and now he hasn't sense enough <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> her." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'How {{can that}} be?' faltered Selina, her throat seeming <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> {{together}} as she just began to perceive its possibility. 'He had been--going {{to marry me}} twice--and we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> New Zealand.' ...|$|R
50|$|Sherlock's older brother, {{who works}} in the {{innermost}} workings of the British government, comes to visit Sherlock and Amyus at Holmes Manor but says that he could not picture the idea of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> America, that he has a fixed orbit that he like <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> <b>to</b> it.|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} you intend to do, Gully; but I mean to bolt. If she thinks I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> here {{for the next two}} years she is jolly much mistaken." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You blessed girl!" [...] said Marilla, yielding. [...] "I {{feel as if}} you'd {{given me}} new life. I guess I ought <b>to</b> <b>stick</b> out and make you go to college--but I know I can't, so I ain't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try. I'll {{make it up to}} you though, Anne." ...|$|R

60|$|Among {{other things}} he learned beche-de-mer English, {{with which he}} could talk with all white men, and with all {{recruits}} who otherwise would have talked in a thousand different dialects. Also, he learned certain things about the white men, principally that they kept their word. If they told a boy he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> receive a <b>stick</b> of tobacco, he got it. If they told a boy they would knock seven bells out of him if he did a certain thing, when he did that thing, seven bells invariably were knocked out of him. Mauki {{did not know what}} seven bells were, but they occurred in beche-de-mer, and he imagined them to be the blood and teeth that sometimes accompanied the process of knocking out seven bells. One other thing he learned: no boy was struck or punished unless he did wrong. Even when the white men were drunk, as they were frequently, they never struck unless a rule had been broken.|$|R
