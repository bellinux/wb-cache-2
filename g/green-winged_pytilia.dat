50|$|It is a brood {{parasite}} to the <b>green-winged</b> <b>pytilia.</b> Male long-tailed paradise whydahs {{imitate the}} song of the male <b>green-winged</b> <b>pytilia.</b> The whydah chicks are larger and louder than the host chicks, so the foster parents will give them more attention than their own chicks.|$|E
50|$|The <b>green-winged</b> <b>pytilia</b> (Pytilia melba) is {{a common}} species of estrildid finch found in Africa. It has an {{estimated}} global extent of occurrence of 6000000 km2.|$|E
50|$|Although {{difficult}} to breed in captivity {{because of their}} brood parasitic nature, these finches, particularly the males, are sold as pets in the United States and other countries. When breeding these birds in captivity, a single male is usually given access to multiple females and each female needs access to multiple active <b>green-winged</b> <b>pytilia</b> nests.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{a number}} of bird species around the lake. These include African fish eagles (Haliaeetus vocifer), {{malachite}} kingfishers (Alcedo cristata), pied kingfishers (Ceryle rudis), swamp flycatchers (Muscicapa aquatica), village weavers (Ploceus cucullatus), [...] speckled mousebirds (Colius striatus), black-lored (Turdoides melanops) and arrow-marked (T. jardineii) babblers, African paradise-flycatchers (Terpsiphone viridis), scarlet-chested (Nectarinia senegalensis), bronze (N. kilimensis) and green-headed (N. verticalis) sunbirds, yellow-fronted canaries (Serinus mozambicus), <b>green-winged</b> <b>pytilias</b> (Pytilia melba), great (Phalacrocorax carbo) and white-breasted (P. lucidus) cormorants, openbill (Anastomus lamelligerus) and yellow-billed (Mycteria ibis) storks and cattle egrets (Bubulcus ibis). There is also a pair of semi-domesticated grey crowned cranes (Balearica regulorum) at the Jambo Beach resort in Gahini.|$|R
50|$|Vidua orientalis {{has often}} been {{considered}} a subspecies of eastern paradise whydah, Vidua paradisea, since both birds parasitise the <b>green-winged</b> <b>pytilia,</b> Pytilia melba, a common species of estrildid finch. However, the finch has two subspecies, nominate melba and citerior, which are sometimes treated as separate species. The ranges of these two taxa correspond well to those of V.paradisea and V. orientalis.|$|E
50|$|Notable animals {{found here}} include the Djibouti {{francolin}} (Pternistis ochropectus), {{a population of}} <b>green-winged</b> <b>pytilia</b> that may actually be a distinct species or subspecies (Pytilia (melba) flavicaudata), {{as well as the}} mysterious and undescribed TÃ´ha sunbird or Djibouti sunbird (Chalcomitra sp. indet.). All of these birds do not occur outside Djibouti, and except for the francolin they have only ever been found in Day Forest. More widespread birds inhabiting the forest are Gambaga flycatcher (Muscicapa gambagae), Somali bulbul (Pycnonotus (barbatus) somaliensis) and Somali starling (Onychognathus blythii). The rare colubrid snake Platyceps afarensis is also found here.|$|E
50|$|The Sahel {{paradise whydah}} does not build its own nests, but parasitises the <b>green-winged</b> <b>pytilia,</b> Pytilia melba, a common species of estrildid finch. These birds do not destroy the host green-winged pytilia's eggs, but they deposit their own {{eggs in the}} nests of their hosts, adding them to those already present. As in other whydah species to attract hens the songs of the males mimic the song of their hosts. These birds are not monogamous pairs, in fact males breed with many females. In a {{breeding}} season females may lay about 22 eggs, that hatch after 12-13 days of incubation. The diet of this species consists of seeds and grain.|$|E
