5|$|<b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> {{it really}} sums up just what I felt {{as far as}} the {{competition}} goes. It's a very overwhelming process to go through and you really do feel that there's something else that got you there. Especially with how I didn't feel confident before and then something just clicked and I could look people in the eyes and really try and deliver a song.|$|E
25|$|We, the {{descendants}} of the pioneer long hunters of the mountains, have been called Scotch-Irish and pure Anglo-Saxon, and that is complimentary, <b>I</b> <b>reckon.</b> But we want the world to know that we are Americans. The spiritual environment and our religious life in the mountains have made our spirit wholly American, and that true pioneer American spirit still exists in the Tennessee mountains.|$|E
25|$|Herbert Sutcliffe {{needed some}} getting out. He {{was a great}} battler for England and for Yorkshire. He never gave his wicket away unless he was {{satisfied}} he had made enough already. With Percy Holmes he formed just about the finest opening partnership I bowled against. I got him out cheaply a few times, but he scored a few hundreds against my bowling, so <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> we ended up just about square.|$|E

25|$|Nowhere has Channel Nine {{ever talked}} the one-day game down, nowhere have we ever {{said this is}} a 'B team'. It's rubbish and George should stick to playing cricket and leave (television) rights to the people who know what they're talking about. <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> he's got his hands full as it is. He needs to {{concentrate}} on staying in the side. And he needs to understand where his money's coming from. Without the TV rights deal, George is probably working in a coalmine or flipping burgers at McDonald's.|$|E
25|$|Noll {{has become}} a popular {{internet}} meme, particularly in Australia. The popular phrase 'Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australian Idol title' gained popularity in 2015, with multiple Facebook pages appearing featuring the phrase. Noll acknowledged the internet fame, finding it 'very funny' and stating 'Some of the stuff they’ve done is bloody brilliant and very clever and very funny. <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> half of the kids putting together these memes {{need to be on}} my marketing team!' In January 2016 a Facebook page was created titled 'Get Shannon Noll to Groovin' the Moo 2016'. Despite the pages thousands of likes the organisers of Groovin' the Moo didn't reach out to the artist to perform. In June 2016, the 'GATchphrase' for the 2016 GAT (a theme chosen by the VCE students of Victoria to write into their papers to show group protest) was voted to be Shannon Noll was robbed of the 2003 Australia Idol title. An estimated 3,600 took part in this event. Noll is recognisable by his southern cross tattoo, an image of which was highly circulated in internet meme culture. This displays his patriotic pride and love for Australia.|$|E

500|$|In retirement, Nash {{was asked}} why he never won a Brownlow Medal (the award for the Best and Fairest player in the VFL). He replied, [...] "I was never the best and fairest but <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> I {{might have been the}} worst and dirtiest. I played it hard and tough." ...|$|E
500|$|On-screen, Babe {{announced}} her plans to serve breakfast at The Vic {{and it was}} reported that she would spark [...] "stiff" [...] competition from Kathy Beale (Gillian Taylforth) who runs the local café when she launches the breakfast menu. Badland expressed an interest in filming with Steve McFadden (who plays Phil Mitchell) and suggested that Babe could become a mechanic, working for Phil. Speaking to Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap Badland said, [...] "I think she fixes her own car, you see, so <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> she'd get her boiler suit on and go to work with Phil..." [...] Badland believed Babe would [...] "find [...] relationship incredibly difficult because she has known nothing but struggle and rejection all of her life." ...|$|E
500|$|Paparizou's {{first words}} {{after winning the}} 50th Eurovision Song Contest were [...] "We showed the modern face of Greece. <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> that’s the face {{everybody}} loves. Europe is our home!" [...] Upon arrival back in Greece, she was greeted by crowds of fans at Eleftherios Venizelos Airport and the National Fire Brigade created a water-jet archway for her airplane, suggestively bearing the number [...] "001", to pass through after it had landed. On the way to ERT Studios for a welcome party for Paparizou and the Greek delegation, people were standing {{on either side of}} the road throwing rose petals along the route of Paparizou's bus. When she reached ERT Studios, she was [...] "met with deafening applause" [...] and after moving from sight for a few minutes, she emerged on stage dressed in the Greek flag and holding the Eurovision trophy.|$|E

500|$|Interviewed in January 2006, Chambers foreshadowed major {{developments}} for his character when he stated: [...] "I think Sam's ideal woman might be Connie because she's feisty, doesn't beat around {{the bush and}} is very talented, which is always sexy. However <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> they clash quite a lot because she manipulates with her power play and won't drop the act {{so it would be}} very much on a love hate basis." [...] The two characters went on to have a brief sexual relationship, resulting in Connie becoming pregnant with Sam's child. Once the revelation of Connie's pregnancy had been made, Chambers asserted of the tension between the separated couple: [...] "Some of the scenes with Connie work amazingly well because we do genuinely get worked up and we like {{to keep it that way}} until filming is finished. It's a useful tip to let the frustrations come through in your work - it makes good viewing." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{couple were}} {{at the center of}} a Red Button {{spin-off}} episode, featuring how Poppy and Fatboy spent their Christmas together. The spinoff, entitled [...] "All I Want for Christmas", featured the characters of Alice, Tyler (Discipline) and Tamwar (Patel), with Wood-Davis reprising her role as Tansy, whilst Keith Parry guest starred as [...] "Santa Tramp". Bright said of the spinoff, [...] "Poppy spends the day with Fatboy. She is under pressure to go back to her family, but realises she doesn't want that. Her and Fatboy have a romantic day, but you don't see anything on screen [...] because it is dominated by the Brannings. There will be an interactive section where viewers can press the red button and see a ten-minute film of how Poppy and Fatboy spent their day". Bright discussed their relationship in an interview with TV Guide, calling them the [...] "jolliest couple in Walford". She said, [...] "It's all very sweet for them both at the moment. <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> they're going to be one of those couples who you want to shout 'Get a room!' at. They're characters who need to be loved. Poppy certainly hopes she's found her Prince Charming".|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with The Northern Echo, Star Stories actor Kevin Bishop discussed the legal issues involved with making the series: [...] "We're not allowed {{to say anything about}} anyone that isn't true. It can be quite tricky. Sometimes we've had to change lines even when the filming is all finished. We go back to the recording studio and put one line over another line. ... The only reason <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> we've not been sued is because actually we've not said anything that technically we can't." [...] He said the series was [...] "well looked after" [...] by attorneys. In a 2009 interview with The Independent, Bishop recounted an experience when he gave a copy of the program to television producers in the United States: [...] "I gave some American producers the Star Stories DVD and those that could be bothered to watch it saw the Tom Cruise one. One guy went 'you can't do that it's Tom Cruise man? [...] 'yeah but you can't do that on TV' [...] 'what you’re talking about Scientology, are you fucking nuts?? [...] has Tom Cruise seen this?!" ...|$|E

500|$|The top six {{finishers}} in the Interzonal {{would qualify}} for the Candidates Tournament. Most observers doubted that a 15-year-old with no international experience could finish among the six qualifiers at the Interzonal, but Fischer told journalist Miro Radoicic, [...] "I can draw with the grandmasters, and there are half-a-dozen [...] in the tournament <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> to beat." [...] Despite some {{bumps in the road}} and a problematic start, Fischer succeeded in his plan: after a strong finish, he ended up with 12/20 (+6−2=12) to tie for 5–6th. The Soviet grandmaster Yuri Averbakh observed, In the struggle at the board this youth, almost still a child, showed himself to be a full-fledged fighter, demonstrating amazing composure, precise calculation and devilish resourcefulness. I was especially struck not even by his extensive opening knowledge, but his striving everywhere to seek new paths. In Fischer's play an enormous talent was noticeable, and in addition one sensed an enormous amount of work on the study of chess. Soviet grandmaster David Bronstein said of Fischer's time in Portorož: [...] "It was interesting for me to observe Fischer, but for a long time I couldn't understand why this 15-year-old boy played chess so well". Fischer became the youngest person ever to {{qualify for the}} Candidates and the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 years, 6 months, 1 day. [...] "By then everyone knew we had a genius on our hands." ...|$|E
500|$|A love {{triangle}} between Natasha, Andrew and Summer is formed. Natasha's {{feelings for}} Andrew grow when they organise a party together, but she notices Andrew's concern for Summer when she collapses and warns Summer away from Andrew. Natasha later asks Andrew if he loves her, {{but he does}} not reply. In December 2010, Summer and Andrew give into their feelings for each other and have sex. Novakovic said Natasha would be [...] "devastated" [...] if she knew what had happened and that she would not let Andrew and Summer off lightly. Andrew tells Natasha {{that he is going to}} business meeting, but he meets Summer instead. While they are together in Summer's house, a fire breaks out. Natasha sees the smoke and calls her father and the emergency services before entering the house to rescue Summer, unaware Andrew is also there. Novakovic explained Natasha's ordeal: [...] "Natasha is pulled from the fire by her dad, Michael. Andrew and Summer are rescued separately, and Natasha has no idea of the reason why Andrew was in the house - he was cheating on her with Summer!" [...] After the rescue, Natasha has to come to terms with the fact she will be scarred from a burn she sustains on her neck. Novakovic said that it is a [...] "big deal" [...] for Natasha, as she aspires to be a model and this could ruin her chances. Novakovic also opines that Summer wants nothing more than to be with Andrew, but how can she take him when Natasha tried to save her? Novakovic believed Natasha was blasé to their feelings adding [...] "Deep down, I think Natasha knows that there's something going on, but she doesn't want to admit it to herself. But sooner or later, <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> she'll have to face the inevitable." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 2012: Liu Peng, {{a scholar}} of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, {{considered}} by the Pew Forum as the government's leading expert on unregistered churches, declared to the Global Times: «It {{is hard to say}} precisely how many Christians there are in China. <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> there might be 50 million. They come from various strata of society and half of them attend house churches».|$|E

2500|$|Yeager made a cameo {{appearance}} in the movie The Right Stuff (1983). He played [...] "Fred," [...] a bartender at [...] "Pancho's Place", which was most appropriate, as Yeager said, [...] "if all the hours were ever totaled, <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> I spent more time at her place than in a cockpit over those years." [...] His own role in the movie was played by Sam Shepard, who received an Academy Award nomination for his performance.|$|E
2500|$|Bradman {{recalled}} {{years later}} that the five deliveries he faced from Gilbert in that match were the fastest he had experienced in his career. [...] Bradman said [...] The keeper took the ball over his head, and <b>I</b> <b>reckon</b> it was halfway to the boundary and that the balls from Gilbert were unhesitatingly faster than anything seen from Larwood or anyone else. Although as he added in his autobiography, Bradman thought Gilbert's action was 'decidedly suspect'.|$|E
2500|$|Reactions to the CoT's {{performance}} were mixed. Dale Earnhardt, Jr., {{after finishing}} 7th, said, [...] "It wasn't a disaster like everybody anticipated. It worked out, <b>I</b> <b>reckon.</b> Racing {{was about the}} same." [...] Drivers were also impressed with the car's ability to bump other competitors without causing a spin (bumper heights were equalized due to street car development, and nose-to-rear bumper contact caused spins that pre-1988 cars would not cause), and NASCAR officials were pleased with the improvements in safety.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've {{already made}} more than <b>I</b> <b>reckoned</b> on, an' it'll be a favor if you take this, 'cause I don't like {{to have so much}} around." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought all}} this over {{for two or}} three days, and then <b>I</b> <b>reckoned</b> <b>I</b> would see if there was {{anything}} in it. I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring, and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun, calculating to build a palace and sell it; but it warn't no use, none of the genies come. So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom Sawyer's lies. <b>I</b> <b>reckoned</b> he believed in the A-rabs and the elephants, but as for me I think different. It had all the marks of a Sunday-school.|$|R
