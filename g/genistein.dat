5|$|Hundreds of {{compounds}} {{have been identified}} using ethnobotany, investigating plants used by indigenous peoples for possible medical applications. Some important phytochemicals, including curcumin, epigallocatechin gallate, <b>genistein</b> and resveratrol are pan-assay interference compounds, meaning that in vitro studies of their activity often provide unreliable data. As a result, phytochemicals have frequently proven unsuitable as lead compounds in drug discovery.|$|E
25|$|Some {{studies have}} found that some {{concentrations}} of isoflavones may have effects on intestinal cells. At low doses, <b>genistein</b> acted as a weak estrogen and stimulated cell growth; at high doses, it inhibited proliferation and altered cell cycle dynamics. This biphasic response correlates with how <b>genistein</b> is thought to exert its effects.|$|E
25|$|Plant {{products}} with estrogenic activity are called phytoestrogens (e.g., coumestrol, daidzein, <b>genistein,</b> miroestrol).|$|E
25|$|Many {{other single}} agents {{have been shown}} to reduce PSA, slow PSA {{doubling}} times, or have similar effects on secondary markers in men with localized cancer in short term trials, such as pomegranate juice or <b>genistein,</b> an isoflavone found in various legumes.|$|E
25|$|Kudzu {{contains}} isoflavones, including puerarin (about 60% of {{the total}} isoflavones), daidzein, daidzin (structurally related to <b>genistein),</b> mirificin, and salvianolic acid, among numerous others identified. In traditional Chinese medicine, where it is known as gé gēn (gegen), kudzu {{is considered one of}} the 50 fundamental herbs thought to have therapeutic effects.|$|E
25|$|Emerging {{evidence}} shows that some phytoestrogens bind to and transactivate peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs). In vitro studies show an activation of PPARs at concentrations above 1 μM, which {{is higher than the}} activation level of ERs. At the concentration below 1 μM, activation of ERs may play a dominant role. At higher concentrations (>1 μM), both ERs and PPARs are activated. Studies have shown that both ERs and PPARs influence each other and therefore induce differential effects in a dose-dependent way. The final biological effects of <b>genistein</b> are determined by the balance among these pleiotrophic actions.|$|E
25|$|It {{is unclear}} if phytoestrogens {{have any effect}} on the cause or {{prevention}} of cancer in females. Some epidemiological studies have suggested a protective effect against breast cancer. Other epidemiological studies found that consumption of soy estrogens is safe for patients with breast cancer, and that it may decrease mortality and recurrence rates. It remains unclear if phytoestrogens can minimize some of the deleterious effects of low estrogen levels (hypoestrogenism) resulting from oophorectomy, menopause, or other causes. A Cochrane Review of the use of phytoestrogens to relieve the vasomotor symptoms of menopause (hot flashes) stated that there was no conclusive evidence to suggest any benefit to their use, although <b>genistein</b> effects should be further investigated.|$|E
500|$|Blockade of COX-1 by aspirin {{apparently}} {{results in}} the upregulation of COX-2 {{as part of a}} gastric defense and that taking COX-2 inhibitors concurrently with aspirin increases the gastric mucosal erosion. Therefore, caution should be exercised if combining aspirin with any [...] "natural" [...] supplements with COX-2-inhibiting properties, such as garlic extracts, curcumin, bilberry, pine bark, ginkgo, fish oil, resveratrol, <b>genistein,</b> quercetin, resorcinol, and others.|$|E

50|$|<b>Genistein</b> {{decreases}} pathological {{accumulation of}} glycosaminoglycans in Sanfilippo syndrome. In vitro animal studies and clinical experiments {{suggest that the}} symptoms of the disease may be alleviated by adequate dose of <b>genistein.</b> <b>Genistein</b> was found to also possess toxic properties toward brain cells. Among many pathways stimulated by <b>genistein,</b> autophagy may explain the observed efficiency of the substance as autophagy is significantly impaired in the disease.|$|E

50|$|The {{dried flower}} buds may contain {{as much as}} 20% rutin with some quercetin. S. japonicum dried fruit contain the {{flavonoid}} glycosides sophoricoside, genistin and rutin and the flavonoid aglycones <b>genistein,</b> quercetin and kaempferol. Another analysis found <b>genistein</b> and <b>genistein</b> glycosides including sophorabioside, sophoricoside, genistein-7-diglucoside, genistein-7-diglucorhamnoside, and kaempferol and the kaempferol glycosides kaempferol-3-sophoroside and kaempferol-3-rhamnodiglucoside. The fruit also contain the alkaloids cytisine, N-methylcytisine, sophocarpine, matrine and stizolamine.|$|E
50|$|Due to its {{structure}} similarity to 17β-estradiol (estrogen), <b>genistein</b> {{can compete with}} it and bind to estrogen receptors. However, <b>genistein</b> shows much higher affinity toward estrogen receptor β than toward estrogen receptor α.|$|E
50|$|Data from {{in vitro}} and in vivo {{research}} confirms that <b>genistein</b> can increase {{rate of growth}} of some ER expressing breast cancers. <b>Genistein</b> was found to increase the rate of proliferation of estrogen-dependent breast cancer when not cotreated with an estrogen antagonist. It was also found to decrease efficiency of tamoxifen and letrozole - drugs commonly used in breast cancer therapy. <b>Genistein</b> was found to inhibit immune response towards cancer cells allowing their survival.|$|E

For example, membrane-bound PPARγ-binding assay showed that <b>genistein</b> can directly {{interact with the}} PPARγ ligand binding domain and has a measurable Ki of 5.7 mM. Gene reporter assays showed that <b>genistein</b> at concentrations between 1 and 100 uM activated PPARs in a dose dependent way in KS483 mesenchymal progenitor cells, breast cancer MCF-7 cells, T47D cells and MDA-MD-231 cells, murine macrophage-like RAW 264.7 cells, endothelial cells and in Hela cells.

50|$|<b>Genistein</b> {{and other}} isoflavones have been {{identified}} as angiogenesis inhibitors, and found to inhibit the uncontrolled cell growth of cancer, most likely by inhibiting the activity of substances in the body that regulate cell division and cell survival (growth factors). Various studies have found that moderate doses of <b>genistein</b> have inhibitory effects on cancers of the prostate, cervix, brain, breast and colon. It has also been shown that <b>genistein</b> makes some cells more sensitive to radio-therapy.; although, timing of phytoestrogen use is also important.|$|E

50|$|When {{ingested}} {{along the}} diet, genistin is readily converted to its aglycone form, <b>genistein.</b> It is hydrolyzed {{by removing the}} covalently bound glucose to form <b>genistein</b> and that <b>genistein</b> is {{the form of the}} compound that is absorbed in the intestine and is the form responsible for the biological activities of the isoflavone. The digestive metabolism was first demonstrated in 2002 that the gut microflora played a large role in the conversion of genistin to <b>genistein.</b> It was later found that enzymes present in the human small intestine and liver also have the ability to convert the isoflavone. Hydrolysis actually starts very quickly in the digestive system once genistin is ingested, conversion begins in the mouth and then continues in the small intestine. Moreover, both human saliva and the intestinal cell-free extract from mice can cause the complete conversion.|$|E
50|$|Genistein's chief {{method of}} {{activity}} is as a tyrosine kinase inhibitor. Tyrosine kinases are less widespread than their ser/thr counterparts but implicated {{in almost all}} cell growth and proliferation signal cascades. Inhibition of DNA topoisomerase II also {{plays an important role}} in the cytotoxic activity of <b>genistein.</b> The observation that transition of normal lymphocytes from quiescence (G0) to the G1 phase of the cell cycle is particularly sensitive to <b>genistein</b> prompted the authors to suggest that this isoflavone may be potential immunosuppressant. <b>Genistein</b> has been used to selectively target pre B-cells via conjugation with an anti-CD19 antibody.|$|E

50|$|Genistin, like <b>genistein,</b> is a {{phytoestrogen}} as it {{was shown}} to stimulate estrogen-dependent breast cancer cell growth in vivo. At a concentration of 1200 ppm, genistin caused significant increase of growth of breast tumors (MCF-7), cellular proliferation and estrogen-responsive pS2 gene expression in mice. Removal of genistin or <b>genistein</b> from the diet caused tumors to regress.|$|E

50|$|In vitro {{study have}} shown that both genistin and <b>genistein</b> are capable of {{enhancing}} bone metabolism in the femoral-metaphyseal tissues of elderly rats. The presence of <b>genistein</b> or genistin in the tissue culture caused {{a significant increase in}} alkaline phosphatase activity, deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) and calcium contents. The effect of <b>genistein</b> was greater than that of genistin. It is also revealed that genistin has a strong bone loss preventive activity on experimental rats, and is especially enhanced by combination with fructooligosaccharides. The amount of new bone produced by grafting genistin in collagen matrix was compared to the bone produced by collagen matrix alone in New Zealand White rabbits, and was observed that genistin caused significant increase in bone formation.|$|E
5000|$|Genistin is an {{isoflavone}} {{found in}} a number of dietary plants like soy and kudzu. It was first isolated in 1931 from the 90% methanol extract of a soybean meal, when it was found that hydrolysis with hydrochloric acid produced 1 mole each of <b>genistein</b> and glucose. Chemically it is the 7-O-beta-D-glucoside form of <b>genistein</b> and is the predominant form of the isoflavone naturally occurring in plants. In fact Studies in the 1970s revealed that 99% of the [...] isoflavonoid compounds in soy are present as their glucosides. The glucosides are converted by digestive enzymes in the digestive system to exert their biological effects. Genistin is also converted to a more familiar <b>genistein,</b> thus, the biological activities including antiatherosclerotic, estrogenic and anticancer effects are analogous.|$|E
