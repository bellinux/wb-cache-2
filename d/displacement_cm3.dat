5000|$|A {{number of}} multi-cylinder 4-stroke model engines have been commercially {{available}} in a radial configuration, beginning with the Japanese O.S. Max firm's FR5-300 five-cylinder, 3.0 cu.in. (50 <b>cm3)</b> <b>displacement</b> [...] "Sirius" [...] radial in 1986. The American [...] "Technopower" [...] firm had made smaller-displacement five- and seven-cylinder model radial engines as early as 1976, but the OS firm's engine was the first mass-produced radial engine design in aeromodelling history. The rival Saito Seisakusho firm in Japan has since produced a similarly sized five-cylinder radial four-stroke model engine of their own as a direct rival to the OS design, with Saito also creating a trio of three-cylinder radial engines ranging from 0.90 cu.in. (15 cm3) to 4.50 cu.in. (75 <b>cm3)</b> in <b>displacement,</b> also all now available in spark-ignition format up to 84 <b>cm3</b> <b>displacement</b> for use with gasoline. The German Seidel firm formerly made both seven- and nine-cylinder [...] "large" [...] (starting at 35 <b>cm3</b> <b>displacement)</b> radio control model radial engines, mostly for glow plug ignition, with an experimental fourteen-cylinder twin-row radial being tried out - the American Evolution firm now sells the Seidel-designed radials, with their manufacturing being done in India.|$|R

50|$|A {{major change}} {{happened}} in 1991, when the FFSA adopted {{a set of}} regulations similar to the British Touring Car Championship, with a maximum engine <b>displacement</b> of 2000 <b>cm3.</b> In 1994, these regulations were formally codified by the FIA as Supertouring.

This record stood for 55 years until broken by the Rutan Voyager.|$|R
50|$|The car had a {{four-cylinder engine}} with {{overhead}} valves. The engine, {{with a single}} SU carburettor and with a <b>displacement</b> of 1496 <b>cm³,</b> delivered 50 bhp (37 kW) at 4500 rpm. The engine was {{essentially the same as}} the 12/50 TH model from 1927 and the 12/50 SD from 1927 to 1929. This made it cheap to manufacture and the model fitted into the 1.5-liter class which was popular at that time.|$|R
50|$|The 1.2 l {{engine is}} called Typ 122 {{and has a}} <b>displacement</b> of 1192 <b>cm3.</b> As {{industrial}} engine, its rated power is 22,8 kW at 3000 min&minus;1 without a governor, the highest torque 81,4 N·m at 2000 min&minus;1.

50|$|On 5 August 1882 he prototyped the Motrice Pia, {{the first}} petrol {{combustion}} engine (one cylinder, 121.6 <b>cm3</b> <b>displacement),</b> {{almost at the}} same time as German Karl Benz. The engine was used to operate his daughter Pia's sewing machine and was fitted to his son's tricycle in 1884. A company called Miari & Giusti in Padova started production of Bernardi's engines and cars in 1894. Soon the company was taken over by Società Italiana Bernardi. It stopped production in 1901.|$|R
50|$|At {{roughly the}} same time as the first {{experiments}} with full-scale aircraft powered with Wankel engines, model aircraft-sized versions were pioneered by a combine of the well-known Japanese O.S. Engines firm and the then-extant German Graupner aeromodeling products firm, under license from NSU/Auto-Union. By 1968 the first prototype air-cooled, single-rotor glow plug-ignition, methanol-fueled 4.9 <b>cm3</b> <b>displacement</b> OS/Graupner model Wankel engine was running, and was produced in at least two differing versions from 1970 to the present day, solely by the O.S. firm after Graupner's demise in 2012.|$|R
50|$|The first {{practical}} {{petrol engine}} {{was built in}} 1876 in Germany by Nikolaus August Otto, although there had been earlier attempts by Étienne Lenoir, Siegfried Marcus, Julius Hock and George Brayton. The first petrol combustion engine (one cylinder, 121.6 <b>cm3</b> <b>displacement)</b> was prototyped in 1882 in Italy by Enrico Bernardi. British engineer Edward Butler constructed the first petrol (gasoline) internal combustion engine. Butler invented the spark plug, ignition magneto, coil ignition and spray jet carburetor, {{and was the first}} to use the word petrol.|$|R
50|$|The {{water-cooled}} {{engine was}} a four-cylinder motor with a <b>displacement</b> of 3768 <b>cm³</b> (bore × stroke = 100 × 120 mm) which produced 24 PS (17.6 kW). The engine had dual ignition (magneto and battery), automatic central lubrication and overhead valves.

The cars had a wheelbase of 3000-3200 mm, the track was 1450 mm and the weight {{in the case of}} the double phaeton was 1650 kg. The top speed was about 70 km / h.|$|R
50|$|The {{water-cooled}} {{engine was}} a six-cylinder motor with a <b>displacement</b> of 6494 <b>cm³</b> (bore × stroke = 105 × 125 mm), which produced 40 PS (29 kW) at 1100 rpm. The engine had magneto ignition, automatic central lubrication and overhead valves.

The wheelbase of the car was 3280 mm, the track was 1457 mm {{and the weight of}} the chassis was 1100 kg. The top speed was about 100 km / h.|$|R
50|$|Displacement is {{also used}} to {{distinguish}} categories of (heavier) and lighter motorbikes with respect to driving licence and insurance requirements. In France and some other EU countries, mopeds of less than 50 <b>cm3</b> <b>displacement</b> (and usually with a two-stroke engine), can be driven with minimum qualifications (previously, they could be driven by any person over 14). This led to all light motorbikes having a displacement of about 49.9 cm3. Some people tuned the engine by increasing the cylinder bore, increasing displacement; such mopeds cannot be driven legally on public roads since they no longer conform to the original specifications and may go faster than 45 km/h.|$|R
50|$|The single-cylinder models (types II and IV) had an {{air-cooled}} engine with an upright cylinder, which produced 3.5 hp (2.6 kW) from a <b>displacement</b> of 451 <b>cm³</b> (bore × stroke = 82 × 86 mm). The engine had a high-voltage Magnetic ignition and was mounted with the three-speed gearbox on the single front wheel, which was propelled by a chain. The transmission was actuated by a right-hand-side slide mechanism. The wheelbase was 2000 mm, the {{track of the}} rear axle 1150 mm {{and the length of}} the vehicles about 2950 mm.

50|$|In 1989, Renault {{launched}} the sports {{version of the}} Renault 19, replacing the Renault 9 Turbo and Renault 11 Turbo.

Other improvements include a more compact FADEC, a lighter cast gearbox housing, interfaces for glass cockpits and a new service tool that allows the FADEC to be programmed in the field. Dimensions of the Centurion 2.0 and 1.7 are nearly identical and the install kits are compatible, so a 1.7 {{at the end of}} its life can be replaced with a 2.0.
