40|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> (EHS) <b>syndrome</b> {{is usually}} {{defined as a}} {{condition}} where an individual experiences adverse health effects {{that he or she}} believes is due to exposure to objects that emit electromagnetic fields. The aim {{of this study was to}} develop a questionnaire that would identify the key symptoms associated with EHS and determine how often these symptoms occur in the general population of the United Kingdom. In the pilot study, an EHS questionnaire was developed and tested. In Study 1 the EHS questionnaire was revised and sent to a randomly selected sample of 20 000 people. Principal components analysis of the symptoms resulted in eight subscales: neurovegetative, skin, auditory, headache, cardiorespiratory, cold related, locomotor, and allergy related symptoms. Study 2 established the validity of the questionnaire in that EHS individuals showed a higher severity of symptoms on all subscales compared to the control group. The two key results of this study were the development of a scale that provides an index of the type and intensity of symptoms commonly experienced by people believing themselves to be EHS and a screening tool that researchers can use to pre-select the most sensitive individuals to take part in their research. © 2006 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R

40|$|Anticonvulsant drug-induced <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>syndrome</b> (DIHS) is a {{disorder}} {{that occurs in}} some patients taking anticonvulsant medications. Fever {{is the most common}} feature, seen in 90 - 100 % of cases. It is also characterized by rash, hepatitis, and other multiorgan involvement. The mechanism is unknown. Implicated anticonvulsants include those in the phenytoin category, carbamazepine, and lamotrigine[1]. This syndrome is now most commonly known as Drug Reaction (or Rash) with Eosinophilia and Systemic Symptoms (DRESS), a term more descriptive of its presentation. It is also known as Drug-Induced Delayed Multiorgan <b>Hypersensitivity</b> <b>Syndrome</b> (DIDMOHS) and Drug-Induced Pseudolymphoma. Anticonvulant <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>syndrome</b> is an older term that has lost favor due to the fact that, aside from antiepileptics, other medications such as sulfonamides and allopurinol have been implicated.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tinnitus is a {{frequent}} condition with high morbidity and impairment in quality of life. The pathophysiology is still incompletely understood. Electromagnetic fields are discussed {{to be involved in}} the multi-factorial pathogenesis of tinnitus, but data proofing this relationship are very limited. Potential health hazards of electromagnetic fields (EMF) have been under discussion for long. Especially, individuals claiming themselves to be electromagnetic hypersensitive suffer from a variety of unspecific symptoms, which they attribute to EMF-exposure. The aim of the study was to elucidate the relationship between EMF-exposure, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and tinnitus using a case-control design. METHODOLOGY: Tinnitus occurrence and tinnitus severity were assessed by questionnaires in 89 electromagnetic hypersensitive patients and 107 controls matched for age-, gender, living surroundings and workplace. Using a logistic regression approach, potential risk factors for the development of tinnitus were evaluated. FINDINGS: Tinnitus was significantly more frequent in the electromagnetic hypersensitive group (50. 72 % vs. 17. 5 %) whereas tinnitus duration and severity did not differ between groups. <b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and tinnitus were independent risk factors for sleep disturbances. However, measures of individual EMF-exposure like e. g. cell phone use did not show any association with tinnitus. CONCLUSIONS: Our data indicate that tinnitus is associated with subjective <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>hypersensitivity.</b> An individual vulnerability probably due to an over activated cortical distress network seems to be responsible for, both, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> and tinnitus. Hence, therapeutic efforts should focus on treatment strategies (e. g. cognitive behavioral therapy) aiming at normalizing this dysfunctional distress network...|$|R
