25|$|Excitotoxicity is the {{pathological}} {{process by which}} nerve cells are damaged or killed by excessive stimulation by neurotransmitters such as glutamate and similar substances. This occurs when receptors for the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate (glutamate receptors) such as the NMDA receptor and AMPA receptor are overactivated by glutamatergic storm. Excitotoxins like NMDA and <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> which bind to these receptors, as well as pathologically high levels of glutamate, can cause excitotoxicity by allowing high levels of calcium ions (Ca2+) to enter the cell. influx elicited by glutamate: role in neuronal death | url = | journal = Molecular Pharmacoloy | volume = 36 | issue = 1| pages = 106–112 | pmid = 2568579 }} Ca2+ influx into cells activates a number of enzymes, including phospholipases, endonucleases, and proteases such as calpain.

Such damage and death of neurons is referred to as an excitotoxic lesion. Thus, in large, concentrated doses <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> can be considered a neurotoxin, and in small doses of dilute solution <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> will chemically stimulate neurons.|$|E

In addition to inducing seizures, <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> is excitotoxic and epileptogenic. <b>Kainic</b> <b>acid</b> induces seizures via activation of kainate receptors containing the GluK2 subunit and also through activation of AMPA receptors, for which {{it serves as a}} partial agonist.

50|$|An excitotoxic lesion is {{the process}} of an {{excitatory}} amino acid being injected into the brain using a cannula. The amino acid is used to kill neurons by essentially stimulating them to death. <b>Kainic</b> <b>acid</b> is an example of an excitatory amino acid used in this type of lesion. One crucial benefit to this lesion is its specificity. The chemicals are selective in that they don't damage the surrounding axons of nearby neurons, but only the target neurons.|$|E
50|$|Similar to estrogen, {{progesterone}} receptors bind several molecules {{other than}} only progesterone. Progestogens are group of natural non-synthetic hormones, including progesterone, which binds to progesterone receptors. Other than progesterone, progestogens have several neuroactive metabolites, most notably allopregnanolone. Progesterone {{has been shown}} to lower the number of estrogen receptors, and thus act as an antagonist to estrogen actions.

5000|$|If a lesion {{is caused}} by a tumor it can be {{classified}} as malignant or benign after analysis of a biopsy. A benign lesion that is evolving into a malignant lesion is called [...] "premalignant." [...] Cancerous lesions are sometimes classified by their growth kinetics, such as the Lodwick classification, which characterizes classes of bone lesions. Another type of lesion is excitotoxic lesions, which can be caused by excitatory amino acids like <b>kainic</b> <b>acid,</b> which kill neurons through over-stimulation.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to staining tissue from treated subjects, {{positive and negative}} controls should be included to ensure method specificity and validity. Typically tissue from untreated control subjects is included to show specificity for degenerating neurons as fluoro-jade should not stain non-degenerating tissue. Additionally, a positive control is included to ensure validity of staining procedures; to show that degenerating neurons will be stained with fluoro-jade. An acceptable positive control includes neurodegenerative tissue from subjects where fluoro-jade has already been validated, such as <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> treated animals.|$|E
50|$|There {{are several}} types of glutamatergic ion {{channels}} in {{the central nervous system}} including AMPA, <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> and N-methyl-D-aspartic acid (NMDA) channels. In the synapse, these receptors serve very different purposes. AMPA can be used experimentally to distinguish the activity of one receptor from the other in order to understand their differing functions. AMPA generates fast excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSP). AMPA activates AMPA receptors that are non-selective cationic channels allowing the passage of Na+ and K+ and therefore have an equilibrium potential near 0 mV.|$|E
50|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of designated {{areas of the}} brain are generally administered by passing an electric current through a wire that is inserted into the brain to lesion a particular area of the brain. Electrical stimulation indiscriminately destroys anything {{in the vicinity of the}} electrode tip, including neural bodies and axons of neurons passing through; therefore it is difficult to attribute the effects of the lesion to a single area. Chemical stimulation is typically administered through a cannula that is inserted into the brain via stereotactic surgery. Chemical stimulation, while more complicated than electrical stimulation, has the distinct advantage of activating cell bodies, but not nearby axons, because only cell bodies and subsequent dendrites contain glutamate receptors. Therefore, chemical stimulation by <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> is more localized than electrical stimulation. It is important to note that both chemical and electrical lesions potentially cause additional damage to the brain due to the very nature of the inserted electrode or cannula. Therefore, the most effective ablation studies are performed in comparison to a sham lesion that duplicates all the steps of producing a brain lesion except the one that actually causes the brain damage, that is, injection of <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> or administration of an electrical shock.|$|E
50|$|Glutamate is an {{excitatory}} neurotransmitter {{capable of}} causing a metabolic injury to neurons. In the hippocampus, GABAergic neurons {{have been found}} vulnerable to excitotoxic action of glutamate at the kainate receptor. These receptors are most dense in sectors CA3 and CA2 of the hippocampus, where nanomolar (nM) concentrations of <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> {{have been associated with}} pronounced and persistent depolarization of CA3 pyramidal neurons. This involving the conduction of excitatory activity along the mossy fiber projections from the area dentate granule cells to the CA3 neurons. Stimulation of this receptor type has been associated with paroxysmal spikes similar to seizures.|$|E
50|$|Other {{scientists}} have also {{worked on this}} perplexing disorder and {{have found that the}} symptoms can be induced by injecting <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> or ibotenic acid into the subthalamic nucleus. I. Hamada and M.R. DeLong found that by using these chemicals, they could destroy only four percent of the subthalamic nucleus and still see hemiballistic movements. However, the abnormal movements would usually disappear within four to five hours even though it did not appear as though the damaged tissue had healed. This suggests that the subthalamic nucleus is plastic enough to adapt to small amounts of damage in order to resume normal function.|$|E
5000|$|Kainate receptors {{have both}} {{presynaptic}} and postsynaptic actions. They have {{a somewhat more}} limited distribution in the brain than AMPA and NMDA receptors, and their function is less well defined. The convulsant <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> induces seizures, in part, by activation of kainate receptors containing the GluK2 subunit and also probably via AMPA receptors [...] Activation of kainate receptors containing the GluK1 subunit can also induce seizures but deletion of this subunit does not reduce seizure susceptibility to kainate or in other seizure models. Deletion of either GluK1 or GluK2 does not alter kindling epileptogenesis or the expression of kindled seizures.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{studies of}} ion {{currents}} {{have shown that}} seletracetam significantly decreases the amount of high-voltage derived Ca2+ currents which have been implicated in causing the high intracellular Ca2+ influx during epileptic activity. It is thought that seletracetam binds to N-type Ca2+ channels and inhibits their ability to allow calcium ions to enter the cell, although the drug does not bind to T-type channels that mediate low-voltage activated Ca2+ currents. Seletracetam thereby decreases cellular excitation, {{but it does not}} seem to affect voltage-gated Na+ or K+ currents. Selectracetam has been demonstrated to not significantly affect currents gated by NMDA, AMPA, GABA, glycine, or <b>kainic</b> <b>acid.</b>|$|E

50|$|As the {{mechanism}} of fluoro-jade labeling is unknown, correlative analysis with traditional neuronal degeneration stains was used to validate this technique. Initially fluoro-jade staining was compared with H & E and de Olmos’ cupric-staining methodologies {{in a variety of}} neurotoxic models of neurodegeneration such as injection of <b>kainic</b> <b>acid,</b> MPTP, or multivalent metals. Each of these neurotoxic insults produce brain-region specific neuronal degeneration and thus could be used to the determine specificity of fluoro-jade. Indeed, these studies demonstrated that fluoro-jade consistently reproduced insult specific staining patterns of neuronal degeneration that were identical to H&E and de Olmos’ cupric staining patterns after the same neurotoxic insults. These results suggest that fluoro-jade is a reliable marker of neurodegeneration.|$|E
50|$|When {{tested in}} mice, {{denatured}} venom from P. occidentalis inhibited convulsions during seizures induced by bicuculline, picrotoxin, and <b>kainic</b> <b>acid.</b> However, this denatured venom did not inhibit seizures induced by pentylenetetrazole. These findings {{imply that the}} denatured venom found in P. occidentalis could possibly help epilepsy in humans without having negative side effects to the neurological system. The neurotoxins in wasps’ venom lead to neurological effects in other animals. The venom of P. occidentalis worked well because it is from a neotropic wasps {{and it has a}} low molecular weight, implying the presence of free amino acids. These free amino acids would need to be further studied to determine their exact effect and mechanism. In the mice, as the venom increased inactivity, it simultaneously decreased grooming, exploratory, and elevation behaviors. It also inhibited spontaneous locomotor activity, implying that a neurodepressant effect could take place which would result in this process being reversible and activity would depend on the dose given.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{evidence}} {{for the role of}} the cerebellum in EBC came from McCormick et al. (1981). They found that a unilateral cerebellar lesion which included both cortex and deep nuclei permanently abolished CRs. In subsequent studies, it was determined that lesions of the lateral interpositus and medial dentate nuclei were sufficient to prevent acquisition of CRs in naïve animals (Lincoln et al., 1982) and abolished CRs in well-trained animals (McCormick & Thompson, 1984). [...] Finally, the use of <b>Kainic</b> <b>acid</b> lesions, which destroy neuronal cell bodies and spare passing fibers, provided {{evidence for}} a highly localized region of cerebellar nuclear cells that are essential for learning and performing CRs (Lavond et al., 1985). The population of cells critical for EBC appears to be restricted to a ~ 1 mm3 area of dorsolateral anterior INP ipsilateral to the conditioned eye. Lesions to this area of INP result in an inability to acquire eyeblink CRs in naïve animals. Additionally, the permanence of the localized lesion effect is remarkable. In well-trained animals, CRs abolished as a result of lesion are not reacquired, even after extensive training that spans over 8 months (Steinmetz et al., 1992). These results demonstrate that a highly localized region of cerebellum must be intact for CR learning to occur in EBC.|$|E

40|$|Introduction - The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to describe facial myokymia in experimental animals accompanying <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> affects on facial motor neurons. Material and methods - Anesthetized cats were injected with <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> into the pons adjacent to the facial nucleus. Facial movements appeared shortly after the injections and facial electromyographic potentials were recorded. Cats were killed up to 4 weeks later, the brainstems were processed histologically, and the number of neurons in the facial nucleus counted. Results - Cats receiving injection of <b>kainic</b> <b>acid</b> adjacent to facial nucleus all developed spontaneous writhing movements of the face ipsilateral to the injection site, clinically resembling facial myokymia in humans. Transient facial paresis, lasting several weeks, appeared in some of the cats. Facial myokymia occurred independent of histological evidence of neuronal loss in facial nucleus, whereas facial paresis occurred in all but one of the animals with significant neuronal loss in the facial nucleus.
