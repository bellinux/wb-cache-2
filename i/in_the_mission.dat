5|$|From 1980 to 1992 Raël and his {{movement}} became increasingly global. In 1980 Claude Raël's fifth Raëlian book Sensual Meditation was published and formal {{publication of the}} Raëlian Messages in the Japanese language began {{as part of the}} Raëlian mission to Japan. Two years later, Africa became another target area <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> to spread the Raëlian messages.|$|E

5|$|It thus {{appears that}} prior to the cession the Mexican authorities, upon examination, found that the Indians had {{abandoned}} the land; that the only adverse claim was vested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> of San Diego and made an absolute grant, subject only to the condition of satisfying whatever claims the mission might have. How can it be said therefore that when the cession was made by Mexico to the United States there was a present recognition by the Mexican government of the occupancy of these Indians? On the contrary, so far as any official action is disclosed, it was distinctly to the contrary, and carried with it an affirmation that they had abandoned their occupancy, and that whatever of title there was outside of the Mexican nation was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> and an absolute grant was made subject only {{to the rights of}} such mission.|$|E
5|$|On 17May 2008, the sixty-fifth {{anniversary of}} the Dambusters raid, a {{memorial}} to Shannon and two other South Australians who took part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> bomb aimers Fred Spafford and Bob Hay, was unveiled in Adelaide {{in the presence of}} the airmen's families. In July 2009 Shannon's daughter Nikki made his medals, uniform, and logbook available to the Australian War Memorial in Canberra, for long-term display.|$|E
5|$|On 26 July 1962 the Chapter General of the Holy Ghost Fathers elected Lefebvre as the Superior General. Lefebvre {{was widely}} {{respected}} for his experience <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> field. On the other hand, certain progressive {{members of his}} congregation, particularly in France, considered his administrative style authoritarian and desired radical reforms. On 7 August 1962 Lefebvre was given the titular archiepiscopal see of Synnada in Phrygia.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{rigorous}} fire-safety {{policies and}} practices, fire incidents are possible during lunar and Martian missions. Fire behavior and hence preventive and responsive safety actions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> are {{strongly influenced by}} <b>the</b> low-gravity environments <b>in</b> flight and on the planetary surfaces. This paper reviews the understanding and key issues of fire safety <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>missions,</b> stressing flame spread, fire detection, suppression, and combustion performance of propellants produced from Martian resources...|$|R
5|$|Sixteen UNCRO {{personnel}} {{died during}} the mission: three Kenyan soldiers were killed; the Czech, Danish, French, and Russian battalions lost two each; and the Argentinean, Belgian, Jordanian, Polish, and Ukrainian contingents each lost one.

5|$|The crew's {{preparation}} for the mission had begun some thirteen months earlier in 1994, with the crew being trained {{in the operation of}} the space shuttle, the mating and docking procedures that would be required as Atlantis approached Mir later <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> and the management of the various scientific experiments being carried on the orbiter during the mission.|$|E
5|$|At {{one point}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> a new {{temporary}} squad member, Liara T'Soni, {{with a different}} set of powers joins the squad, and the player must choose who of the previous two members will remain {{for the rest of the}} mission. The relationship between Shepard and Liara can vary depending on whether they were romantically involved in the original Mass Effect. The mission includes two bosses and a chase scene in which the player must control a high-speed vehicle through the skies of a city. The player may also find numerous in-game upgrades that enhance aspects of the game's weapons and armor.|$|E
50|$|The {{color of}} <b>the</b> {{mudstone}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Missions</b> {{has much to}} do with the presence of the mineral hematite during the its formation. Hematite is formed by iron particles' reaction to oxygen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> atmosphere. Green and gray stones found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Missions</b> were most likely formed <b>in</b> deep water, <b>the</b> red <b>in</b> more shallow water. Ripple marks can be found <b>in</b> much of <b>the</b> rock; they would have formed mostly in shallow water with gentle waves.|$|R

Each troop also rehearsed its own part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission.</b> Lectures were given in escape and evasion and troop commanders and NCO's were given small silk maps of Norway to help with any escape attempt. Another item of escape equipment issued was a pair of trouser fly buttons that, when placed {{one on top of the}} other, became a small compass.|$|E

Cooper, 92 at the time, provided an opportunity to shed light on the operation with his direct involvement <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> as a Surgeon-Lieutenant in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserve (RNVR).

50|$|Depelchin was {{recalled}} to Belgium in 1883 {{to regain}} his health and to allow his leg to heal. It took him four years to completely recover.

Like his books, his appearances were popular and successful. His letters and reports from India were also presented in numerous missionary periodicals in Europe.|$|R
5|$|Jagdgeschwader 3 (JG 3) and Kampfgeschwader 51 (KG 51) were {{tasked with}} {{eliminating}} the Allied units at the Eindhoven base and Gilze-Rijen airfield. The field contained three Spitfire Squadrons and eight Typhoon {{units of the}} RAF and RCAF. Some 22 Bf 109s of I./JG 3 took off, along with four from Stab./JG 3, 15 from III./JG 3 and 19 Fw 190s from IV./JG 3. KG 51 contributed some 21 of their 30 Messerschmitt Me 262 jets to the action.

5|$|Parsons {{participated in}} the bombing of Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, flying on the Enola Gay as weaponeer and Senior Military Technical Observer. Shortly after takeoff, he clambered into the bomb bay and {{carefully}} carried out the procedure that he had rehearsed the night before. It was Parsons and not Tibbetts, the pilot, {{who was in charge}} of the mission. He approved the choice of Hiroshima as the target, and gave the final approval for the bomb to be released. For his part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission,</b> Parsons was awarded the Silver Star, and was promoted to the wartime rank of commodore on 10 August 1945. For his work on the Manhattan Project, he was awarded the Navy Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E

At age 11, Pflueger took his first job working for a picture-framing firm near his home.|$|E
50|$|Food {{became a}} problem both <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>missions</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> refugee-filled hills. <b>The</b> <b>missions</b> had very few Indians present {{to perform the}} manual labor {{necessary}} to produce food, while the Yokut villages had many more mouths to feed than they were accustomed to supporting.|$|R
50|$|The central {{region of}} the country, such as Caazapá is the region that helped the most to {{consolidate}} and form the history of Paraguay.

5|$|Schlachtgeschwader 4 and Jagdgeschwader 2 (SG 4 and JG 2) were {{to strike}} at Sint-Truiden airfield. JG 2 was {{commanded}} by Kurt Bühligen. I./JG 2's ground crews managed to make ready 35 of 46 Fw 190s, 29 of which were Fw 190D. Only 33 pilots were fit for operations. So the Gruppe reported only 33 Fw 190s ready. II./JG 2 could field 20 of 29 Bf 109s. Stab./JG 2 had three Fw 190s ready for the mission. It {{is not clear whether}} Bühligen took part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission.</b> III./JG 2 reported 40 Fw 190s operational, 34 of them Fw 190Ds. However, only 28 of the 43 pilots in the unit were fit for operations and the formation fielded only 28 fighters. In total, 84 aircraft were ready on 31 December, including 28 Fw 190D-9s.|$|E

5|$|The first Spanish {{contact with}} the Manche Ch'ol was in 1525, when an {{expedition}} led by Hernán Cortés crossed their territory. From the early 17th century onwards, Dominican friars attempted their concentration into mission towns and their conversion to Christianity. These attempts alarmed their warlike Itza neighbours to the northwest, who attacked the mission towns and fomented rebellion among the Manche. The Manche Ch'ol <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>mission</b> towns were badly affected by disease, which also encouraged them to flee the towns.|$|E
