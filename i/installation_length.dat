40|$|The dynamic {{flexural}} behaviour of railway bridges {{is influenced by}} the torsional behaviour, and the flexural response tends to be amplified as the flexural natural frequency (the 1 st vibrational mode) and torsional frequency (the 2 nd vibrational mode) are adjoining. To avoid this phenomenon, the installation of concrete segment panels was considered for the reinforcement of torsional stiffness by connecting bottom flanges between girders. This alternative can increase the torsional stiffness by providing the restraint in torsional vibration and reduce the influence of torsional behaviour on the amplification of flexural responses. This study investigates the effect of the concrete segment panels on the control of torsional dynamic responses and on the increment of torsional frequency. The excitation tests on a full-size bridge specimen with 30 m span length were conducted with respect to the <b>installation</b> <b>length</b> of concrete panels up to 7 m from each ends. The results show that the installation of concrete segment panel augments the torsional frequency up to 22 % while the flexural frequency keeps its original value. It is concluded that the dynamic behaviour of girder bridges can be controlled by the adjustment of <b>installation</b> <b>length</b> of concrete panels, thereby reducing the torsional responses...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{sensitivity}} of differential-pressure flow meters {{to the quality}} of the approaching flow continues to be a cause for concern to flowmeter manufacturers and users. Distortions to the approaching velocity profiles generated by pipe fittings and installations located upstream of a flowmeter, can lead to considerable errors in flowmetering. This cannot be ignored because of the likely cost and process efficiency implications. This paper describes the effects of various entrance flow velocity profiles on the performance of an orifice flowmeter with and without flow conditioning. Asymmetric swirling velocity profiles were generated by a ball valve. These caused significant shifts to the meter’s calibration. The use of a vaned-plate flow conditioner, consisting of six vanes attached to a 70 % porosity plate, greatly improved the performance of the meter. Thus, the device can be used as part of a flowmetering package that will have considerably reduced <b>installation</b> <b>lengths.</b> The less-sophisticated NEL plate proved to be a good flow straightened, i. e. a good swirl remover, but was not an efficient flow conditioner...|$|R
40|$|The {{acoustic}} {{performance of the}} ducted Helmholtz resonator (HR) system is analyzed theoretically and numerically. The periodic HR array could provide a wider noise attenuation band due to the coupling of the Bragg reflection and the HR’s resonance. However, the transmission loss achieved by a periodic HR array is mainly dependent {{on the number of}} HRs, which restricted by the available space in the longitudinal direction of the duct. The full distance along the longitudinal direction of the duct for HR’s installation is sometimes unavailable in practical applications. Only several pieces of the duct may be available for the installation. It is therefore that this paper concentrates on the {{acoustic performance}} of a HR array consisting of several periodic parts. The transfer matrix method and the Bragg theory are used to investigate wave propagation in the duct. The theoretical prediction results show good agreement with the Finite Element Method (FEM) simulation results. The present study provides a practical way in noise control application of ventilation ductwork system by utilizing the advantage of periodicity with the limitation of available completed <b>installation</b> <b>length</b> for HRs...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the influence of different types of rhizomes utilized as seed and the effects of mulch in the culture of Turmeric. This work was conducted in the experimental cultivation area of the Universidade de Ribeirão Preto - UNAERP, in Ribeirao Preto, state of Sao Paulo, Brazil from September/ 1997 to July/ 1998. The experiments were arranged in a randomized complete block with a factorial arrangement 2 x 3, design with 4 replications (32 plants each). The treatments consisted of the use of types of rhizomes utilized to proliferation (head and finger) and types of mulch (absent, grass and leaves/branches). This study investigated proliferation (61, 88 and 124 days after <b>installation),</b> <b>length,</b> shooting and number of leaves of the mother plant besides the number of leaves of the shoot (112, 146 and 233 days after installation), number of finger rhizomes and head rhizomes, fresh and dry biomass of rhizomes and the yield of essential oil (after harvest - July 1998). Obtained results showed a great influence of the type of rhizome used to proliferation. Head rhizomes produced, in weight, about 30 % more, when compared to plants from finger rhizomes. Mulching almost duplicated rhizome productivity from 2338 kg. ha - 1 of dry rhizomes to 4499 kg. ha - 1, when rhizome used to proliferation was finger and from 3046 kg. ha - 1 to 5943 kg. ha - 1, when using head rhizomes.

40|$|Often, road {{construction}} causes {{the need to}} create a work zone. In these scenarios, portable concrete barriers (PCBs) are typically installed to shield workers and equipment from errant vehicles as well as prevent motorists from striking other roadside hazards. For an existing W-beam guardrail system installed adjacent to the roadway and near the work zone, guardrail sections are removed in order to place the portable concrete barrier system. The focus of this research study was to develop a proper stiffness transition between W-beam guardrail and portable concrete barrier systems. This research effort was accomplished through development and refinement of design concepts using computer simulation with LS-DYNA. Several design concepts were simulated, and design metrics were used to evaluate and refine each concept. These concepts were then analyzed and ranked based on feasibility, likelihood of success, and ease of installation. The rankings were presented to the Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) for selection of a preferred design alternative. Next, a Critical Impact Point (CIP) study was conducted, while additional analyses were performed to determine the critical attachment location and a reduced <b>installation</b> <b>length</b> for the portable concrete barriers. Finally, an additional simulation effort was conducted in order to evaluate the safety performance of the transition system under reverse-direction impact scenarios as well as to select the CIP. Recommendations were also provided for conducting a Phase II study and evaluating the nested MGS configuration using three Test Level 3 (TL- 3) full-scale crash tests according to the criteria provided in the Manual for Assessing Safety Hardware, as published by the American Association of Safety Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).

Their applicability in pipeline projects is expected to increase with the rapid advancements in technology and emerging concerns regarding social costs related to trenching methods. Selecting appropriate project delivery system (PDS) is a key to the success of trenchless projects. To ensure success of the project, the selected project delivery should be tailored to trenchless project specific characteristics and owner needs, since the effectiveness of project delivery systems differs based on different project characteristics and owners requirements. Since different trenchless methods have specific characteristics such rate of <b>installation,</b> <b>lengths</b> of <b>installation,</b> and accuracy, the same project delivery systems may not be equally effective for different methods. The intent {{of this paper is to}} evaluate the appropriateness of different PDS for different trenchless methods. PDS are examined through a structured decision-making process called Fuzzy Delivery System Selection Model (FDSSM). The process of incorporating the impacts of: (a) the characteristics of trenchless projects and (b) owners’ needs in the FDSSM is performed by collecting data using questionnaires deployed to professionals involved in the trenchless industry in order to determine the importance of delivery systems selection attributes for different trenchless methods, and then analyzing this data. The sensitivity of PDS rankings with respect to trenchless methods is considered in order to evaluate whether similar project delivery systems are equally effective in different trenchless methods. The effectiveness of PDS with respect to attributes is defined as follows: a project delivery system is most effective with respect to an attribute (e. g., ability to control growth in costs) if there is no project delivery system that is more effective than that PDS. The results of this study may assist trenchless project owners to select the appropriate PDS for the trenchless method selected...|$|R
40|$|The {{orifice plate}} flow meter {{is the most}} common form of {{differential}} pressure flow meter used in industry. The standard discharge coefficient, which is defined by both British Standard and [SO 5167, is only valid if the flow approaching the meter is perfectly settled and fully developed. However, in practical applications the flow approaching the orifice meter is often disturbed by pipe-fittings and consequently the measurements become inaccurate. Basically, the design of the orifice plate meters that are independent of the upstream disturbances is a main goal for orifice plate metering. Either using a long straight pipe, or a flow conditioner upstream of an orifice plate, usually achieves this goal. In this project the effect of the fractal flow conditioner for both standard and non-standard flow conditions has been investigated in an experimental rig and simulation work. The results of using a combination of the fratal flow conditioner and orifice plate for non-standard flow conditions including swirling flow and asymmetric flow show that this package can preserve the accuracy of metering up to the level required in the Standards. The simulation results also show that the device can be used as a part of a flow metering package that will considerably reduce <b>installation</b> <b>lengths.</b> According to the main idea to introduce a predetermined turbulence flow caused by a flow conditioner for orifice plate flow metering, author was introduced another type of flow conditioner known as a metal foam flow conditioner. Open-cell metal foams with a porosity of 78. 8 % was formed and fashioned as a flow conditioner. Again the experimental results using the metal foam flow conditioner showed this metal foam flow conditioner demonstrated a good performance in terms of removing swirl and producing a repeatedly same flow profile within a short distance downstream of the flow conditioner. Furthermore, the low pressure drop across the metal foam is another advantage of this flow conditioner where the pressure loss coefficient for this flow conditioner is approximately 2. 5.

40|$|Two {{types of}} {{instruments}} were installed in a borehole in order to monitor matric and water potentials of various hydrogeologic units consisting of tuff. The borehole was drilled {{as part of a}} study to provide information to the US Department of Energy for their use in evaluating Yucca Mountain, Nevada, for a repository for high-level radioactive waste. Heat-dissipation probes were used to monitor matric potentials and thermocouple psychrometers were used to monitor water potentials. Two major concerns regarding the use of these instruments in deep boreholes are: (1) the effect of length of the lead wires, and (2) the inability to recalibrate the instruments after <b>installation.</b> The <b>length</b> of the lead wire contributes to the source resistance and lead capacitance, which affects the signal settling time. Both instruments tested proved to be insensitive to lead-wire length, except when connected to smaller input-impedance data loggers. Thermocouple wires were more sensitive than heat-dissipation probe wires because of their greater resistance and quality of voltmeters used. Two thermocouple psychrometers were installed at every instrument station for backup and verification of data, because the instruments could not be recalibrated in situ. Multiple scanning rather than single-point scanning of the evaporation curve of a thermocouple psychrometer could give more reliable data, especially in differentiating between very wet and very dry environments. An isolated power supply needs to be used for each heat dissipation probe rather than a single power supply for a group of probes to avoid losing data from all probes when one probe malfunctions. This type of system is particularly desirable if the site is unattended by an operator for as long as a month. 20 refs., 13 figs., 2 tabs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{observations and}} analysis experienced by a utility end user. As SCADA systems become {{a crucial part}} of daily operations for utilities, finding low-cost, reliable communications for substations in remote geographic locations often presents a challenge. Current SCADA communications methods, including framerelay, T 1, and fiber are often unreasonably expensive, in terms of <b>installation</b> costs and <b>length</b> of service contracts. Consequently, this can make integrating a utility’s entire system into a SCADA network economically unfeasible or difficult to justify. In an effort to overcome these obstacles, Plumas-Sierra Rural Electric Cooperative (PSREC) recently installed redundant, commercially available satellite Internet connections, from two separate providers, at two of its substations. These satellite Internet connections serve as redundant communications paths for the substations and enable their integration into the SCADA system. This paper discusses the architecture, security, implementation, results, and lessons learned from installing commercial satellite Internet services as a means of communications for SCADA systems, as well as the economic reality of using such a service over typical, more common SCADA communications methods.

40|$|It is {{the purpose}} of this study to {{demonstrate}} the viability and economy of Design- of-Experiments (DOE), to arrive at micro-secondary flow control installation designs that achieve optimal inlet performance for different mission strategies. These statistical design concepts were used to investigate the properties of "low unit strength" micro-effector installation. "Low unit strength" micro-effectors are micro-vanes, set a very low angle-of incidence, with very long chord lengths. They are designed to influence the neat wall inlet flow over an extended streamwise distance.

In order to properly evaluate the performance differences between the single band extended chord <b>length</b> <b>installation</b> designs and the segmented multiband short chord length designs, both sets of installations must be optimal. Critical to achieving optimal micro-secondary flow control installation designs is the understanding of the factor interactions that occur between the multiple bands of micro-scale vane effectors.

40|$|In {{the last}} several years {{there have been a number}} of papers {{discussing}} optimal policies for the inventory problem. Almost without exception these papers are devoted to the determination of optimal purchasing quantities at a single installation faced with some pattern of demand. It has been customary to make the assumption that when the installation in question requests a shipment of stock, this shipment will be delivered in a fixed or perhaps random length of time, but at any rate with a time lag which is independent of the size of the order placed. There are, however, a number of situations met in practice in which this assumption is not a tenable one.

Taking into account the line segments slip surface in stabilization of earth slopes is a new topic which has been addressed in this paper.

This research activity essentially rises due to this combined concept. The WEC under exam is a floating device belonging to the Wave Activated Bodies (WAB) class. Experimental data were performed at Aalborg University in different scales and layouts, and the performance of the models was analysed under a variety of irregular wave attacks. The numerical simulations performed with the codes MIKE 21 BW and ANSYS-AQWA. Experimental results were also used to calibrate the numerical parameters and/or to directly been compared to numerical results, in order to extend the experimental database. Results of the research activity are summarized in terms of device performance and guidelines for a future wave farm <b>installation.</b> The device <b>length</b> should be “tuned” based on the local climate conditions. The wave transmission behind the devices is pretty high, suggesting that the tested layout should be considered as a module of a wave farm installation. Indications on the minimum inter-distance among the devices are provided. Furthermore, a CALM mooring system leads to lower wave transmission and also larger power production than a spread mooring. The two numerical codes have different potentialities. The hydrodynamics around single and multiple devices is obtained with MIKE 21 BW, while wave loads and motions for a single moored device are derived from ANSYS-AQWA. Combining the experimental and numerical it is suggested –for both coastal protection and energy production– to adopt a staggered layout, which will maximise the devices density and minimize the marine space required for the installation. ...|$|R

Consequently those components that prevent carry out the cited operations should be eliminated, appealing to the installation of local exhaust ventilation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a research project that investigated excessive strand end slip observed recently in some prestressed piles. From measurements taken in the field, it is apparent that the problem of excessive initial strand slip is independent of pile shape and size. Strand end slip is evident in piles of different manufacturers in different states in the Southeast. Excessive strand end slip was found in both {{the top and bottom of}} the cross section of the piles, although the top portion of the cross section generally exhibited much higher initial slip. Several preventive measures ran be adopted to reduce the excessive strand end slip. These preventive measures include: a) proper concrete mixture proportioning to reduce top bar effect; b) use of higher-strength concrete with the lowest possible slump and setting time; c) assessment of the condition of the strands prior to installation to insure excellent bond characteristics; d) gradual release of prestress, with an optimal release sequence; and e) use of adequate vibration to ensure consolidation. The strand end slip measured at five prestressing plants in the Southeast is considerably higher than the allowable end slip and is expected to affect the pile performance. If the strand slip theory is adopted the strand development length increases substantially die to the excessive strand end slip. A top bar effect factor similar to the one used in reinforced concrete design is recommended. To maintain the excellent quality of precast and prestressed concrete products, manufacturers should adopt a dynamic quality control process that follows the rapid changes in the industry. More tests are necessary to ensure excellent quality such as the Moustafa or an equivalent test, to assess the bond capabilities of the strands, end slip measurements. and direct measurement of the transfer <b>length.</b> <b>Installation</b> of piles should proceed in a manner to alleviate the top bar effects by placing piles alternately in their best and worst directions...|$|R

Također, trebalo je utvrditi postojanje, odnosno odsutnost arhitekture poradi budućeg planiranja premještanja raznovrsnih instalacija u tom dijelu Iloka. Istraživanjima je definiran velik ulazni obrambeni objekt pred istočnim pročeljem dvorca Odescalchi, a na crkvi Sv.

In June and July 2008, {{the last}} archaeological {{excavation}} project {{was conducted in}} Ilok, at the Castle of the Dukes of Ilok and the Church of St. Peter the Apostle sites, {{which is part of}} the project “Research, Reconstruction and Revitalisation of the Cultural Heritage of Ilok-Vukovar-Vučedol”, supported by the Croatian Government and the European Development Bank. Research was conducted in line with the clearly defined guidelines of the Ministry of Culture, and its objective was to define single noteworthy elements. One of these was the considerable defensive entry structure on the eastern façade of the Odescalchi Palace, and another was the unexamined part of the Gothic Church of St. Peter the Apostle that could be excavated given the complex communal infrastructure. As for the church, it was necessary to find out whether there were pieces of architecture at two locations near the north façade of the Primary School, lying south of the fifteenth century Church of St. Peter the Apostle. The excavations at the site Castle of the Dukes of Ilok focussed on the area from the 2007 excavation line eastward over a length of 19. 06 m and from the outbuilding toward the southern over a length of 15. 51 m. The objective of the excavation was to ascertain where the continuation of the fortified entrance complex of the Castle of the Dukes of Ilok was in the ground-plan. The walls of the entrance building were identified below a layer of shattered rubble covering a length of 14. 62 m. They were damaged when outbuildings were constructed in the nineteenth century, and by recent <b>installations.</b> The total <b>length</b> of the entrance complex is 22. 97 m, and the width 11. 13 m. From historical sources, we learned that the outbuildings were burned down in the mid-twentieth century, so that their walls remained preserved only up to a height of two rows of bricks. Excavations at the site of the Church of St. Peter the Apostle in 2008 were conducted at four locations. In the excavations of 2008, the southern part of the church ground-plan was defined at two spots with two trial-trenches placed on the northern side of the road. This enabled the excavation of the southern part of the apses with a support pillar, and the southern part of the bell-tower with a support pillar at the front of the church.
