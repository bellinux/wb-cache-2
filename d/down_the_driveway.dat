5|$|The {{sixth and}} first killer tornado of the {{outbreak}} touched down around 3:10a.m. EST and snapped several trees. After traveling for {{three quarters of}} a mile, it produced significant structural damage along North Carolina Highway 222 where a brick home was destroyed. A nearby trailer was rolled 30ft <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> of the home. The four residents sustained no injuries despite having not taken shelter before the tornado. A double-wide mobile home was blown off its foundation and flipped for 50ft before falling to the ground. One of the occupants, a 61-year-old woman was killed and her husband sustained major injuries. Three other mobile homes were destroyed by the tornado before it crossed into Wilson County. Once in Wilson County, several more mobile homes sustained significant damage before the tornado lifted. Damages from the tornado in both counties amounted to $700,000. The tornado was rated as an EF2 by the National Weather Service.|$|E
25|$|He {{travelled}} {{past the}} Port Arthur historic site toward a Palmer's Lookout Road property {{owned by the}} Martins, where he came across Roger Larner driving out of his driveway. Larner had met him on some occasions more than 15 years before, but did not initially recognise him. Bryant told Larner he had been surfing and had bought a property called Fogg Lodge and was now looking to buy some cattle from Larner. Bryant also made several comments about buying the Martins' place next door. He asked if Marian Larner was home, {{and asked if he}} could continue <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> of the farm to see her. Larner said OK, but told Bryant he would come also. Bryant changed his mind and left, claiming he was going to return in the afternoon.|$|E
25|$|Three marked Cleveland Police {{vehicles}} {{were the first}} to arrive on the scene at 8:30 PM, one on Beulah Avenue and two at the intersection of Auburndale Avenue and Lakeview Road. Patrolmen Kenneth Gibbons and Willard Wolff {{were the first to}} arrive at the intersection of Lakeview and Auburndale, at 8:30 PM. They claim to have observed a plainclothes police officer grappling with a young African American male in or near the front yard of the Evans home. As they exited their vehicle to assist, a rifle bullet struck the engine of their marked police vehicle. It exploded, killing Wolff and severely injuring Gibbons. Police Sergeants Sam Levy and Bill Moran arrived moments behind Gibbons and Wolff. They ran behind the duplexes at 1435 and 1439 Lakeview Road, and used the alley to get behind the Lakeview Tavern. They then moved <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> between the tavern and the Evans home to reach Auburndale Avenue. At this point, Moran was shot and dived behind a car parked on the street, where he was shot again. Levy found safety under the car.|$|E
50|$|In July 1956, Jeffreys' mother, Kate Jeffreys Carmichael, 67, was {{run down}} {{and killed by}} her own {{automobile}} in <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> of <b>the</b> home of her daughter. Police said Carmichael was taking books from the car's trunk when the emergency brake apparently slipped. <b>The</b> car rolled <b>down</b> <b>the</b> sloping <b>driveway,</b> dragging <b>the</b> actress' mother 26 feet.|$|R
5000|$|Encouraged by Sarah's words, Rambo {{returns to}} the United States. The last scene shows him walking along a rural highway, past a horse farm and a rusted mailbox with the name [...] "R.

60|$|They fairly belted {{the city}} in their run, and in the end, as they went {{sweeping}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> curving <b>driveway</b> of <b>the</b> lake, Mrs. Ollnee's face was delicately pink {{and her eyes were}} bright with happiness. To her son she seemed once more the lovely and delicate figure of his boyhood's admiration. It seemed that her death-like trance had been a horrible dream.|$|R
6000|$|... "All right, {{take his}} word for it," [...] said he. [...] "And if you'll be {{responsible}} for the girl you may keep her till we're ready to sail. Perhaps that's the best way, after all." [...] Then, without a word of good-bye, he entered his little motor car and started <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b>|$|E
60|$|Josie went to {{her room}} early, saying she was tired, {{but as soon as}} she was alone and free she slipped on a jacket and stealthily left the house. <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> she crept like a shadow, out through the gates, over the bridge, and then she turned down the pathway leading to Old Swallowtail's cottage.|$|E
6000|$|For {{a little}} while, {{as they went}} <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> side by side, he was meditatively silent. She {{wondered}} {{what he thought of}} Howard Spence, until suddenly she remembered that her secret was still her own, that Peter had as yet no particular reason to single out Mr. Spence for especial consideration. She could not, however, resist saying, [...] "New Yorkers are like that." ...|$|E
5000|$|.....In {{those days}} (1938), {{the trip from}} New York to Pavilion took at least 10 hours. I arrived late in the evening, so it wasn't until the next morning that I {{had a chance to}} walk around the grounds. Bill Gratwick and I were strolling <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long <b>driveway</b> when {{suddenly}} my breath was taken by the incredible color of rows of tree peonies in full bloom.|$|R
50|$|Yet {{another car}} drove past and Bryant shot at it, hitting the passenger, Susan Williams, in the hand. The driver, Simon Williams, {{was struck by}} fragments. The driver of another {{approaching}} vehicle saw this and reversed back up the road. Bryant also fired at this car, hitting it but not injuring anyone. Bryant then {{got back into the}} BMW and drove <b>down</b> <b>the</b> Seascape <b>driveway</b> to <b>the</b> house.|$|R
40|$|Parking garages {{should not}} present blank walls to the street. The best {{solution}} is to wrap the garage with commercial or residential uses. An alternative is to locate retail {{on the ground floor}} of <b>the</b> garage. <b>Driveways</b> Sidewalks should take priority over driveways as drivers are legally required to yield to pedestrians on sidewalks. <b>The</b> <b>driveway</b> should ramp up to sidewalk level at the curb; the sidewalk should not ramp <b>down</b> to meet <b>the</b> <b>driveway...</b>|$|R
60|$|She {{turned to}} lead the way inside. While Louise hesitated to follow the {{limousine}} started with a roar from its cylinders and disappeared <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway,</b> the two men going with it. The absence of the lamps rendered the darkness around the solitary house rather uncanny. An intense stillness prevailed except for the diminishing rattle of the receding motor car. In the hall was a light and a woman.|$|E
60|$|Professor! Josie felt a {{distinct}} shock. She had to flatten {{herself against the}} wall, too, and remain rigid, for the man abruptly turned the corner and marched <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> Half way to the brilliantly lighted street he dodged behind the building opposite the hotel, threading his way through narrow back yards. Josie followed, swift and silent. Finally they reached {{a place where the}} man was forced to pass beneath the rays of a lamp and Josie was near enough to see his face. It was, in reality, Professor John Dyer.|$|E
60|$|He led {{her back}} to the garage and helped her into the seat beside him. As silently as {{possible}} he ran the machine into the driveway. A hundred yards to the left, half hidden by intervening trees and shrubbery, rose the dark bulk of a house. A subdued light shone through the drawn blinds of several windows--the only sign of life about the premises until the car had cleared the garage and was moving slowly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> Then a door opened in the house letting out a flood of light in which the figure of a man was silhouetted. A voice broke the silence.|$|E

2500|$|Roosevelt {{was totally}} and {{permanently}} paralyzed from <b>the</b> waist <b>down,</b> {{and unable to}} stand or walk without support. [...] For the next few months, he confined himself to indoor pursuits, including resuming his lifelong hobby of stamp collecting. [...] In December 1921, after he had recuperated for several months, a physiotherapist began working with him {{to determine the extent}} of the damage. He was able to perform small exercises on his own, moving one muscle and then another. He was fitted with heavy steel braces that locked at the knee and provided enough stability that he could stand with crutches. In 1922, at Springwood, he worked diligently to make his way across the room. He set himself the goal of getting <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long <b>driveway,</b> managing to do it once, but never trying again.|$|R
50|$|The song is a ballad {{in which}} the song's narrator tells about his life through walking. In the first verse, he is a boy who is {{reluctant}} to walk <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> to the school bus and go to school, until he is comforted by his father. In the second verse, the narrator is again comforted by his father after becoming an adult and going {{out into the world}} alone. By the third verse, the father is now very old and they are both walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> The son is walking his father to a nursing home. The father understands because he too had to walk his father <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> It is a song about cycles.|$|E

25|$|Running from Anderson's Plantation {{across the}} hill and back <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> old <b>driveway</b> near to <b>the</b> walled garden is a wall or dyke {{replacing}} a tree lined hedge shown in 1858. The wall or dyke is very unusual {{in that it is}} made from roughly equal sized rounded whinstones and it is held together by cement. A great deal of expense and effort would have been needed to build this long section of dyke, which seems to have been in place by 1911.|$|R
60|$|Toto {{turned and}} trotted {{out into the}} palace garden and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long <b>driveway</b> until {{he came to the}} streets of the Emerald City. Here he paused to listen, and hearing sounds of cheering, he ran swiftly along until he came in sight of the Red Wagon and the Woozy and the Lion and the Mule and all the others. Being a wise little dog, he decided not to show himself to Dorothy just then, lest he be sent back home, but he never lost sight of the party of travelers, all of whom were so eager to get ahead that they never thought to look behind them. When they came to the gates in the city wall, the Guardian of the Gates came out to throw wide the golden portals and let them pass through.|$|R
2500|$|After {{finishing}} {{her shift}} in the dining hall, Welden returned {{to her room and}} changed into walking clothes. Her clothing was adequate for the weather that afternoon but not for the anticipated drop in temperature that night. She packed no bag, took no extra clothing, and did not take any extra money. From all appearances, she did not expect to be gone more than a few hours. Welden walked <b>down</b> <b>the</b> campus <b>driveway</b> and hitched a ride from State Route 67A near the college entrance in North Bennington to a point on State Route 9 near the Furnace Bridge between downtown Bennington and Woodford Hollow. Local contractor Louis Knapp picked her up and drove her as far as his house on Route 9, about [...] from the Long Trail. From this point, Welden either hitchhiked or walked {{the rest of the way}} to the start of the Long Trail in Woodford Hollow.|$|R

50|$|His {{career began}} merely {{at the age}} of 3 as he would ride <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> after every snowfall. At 5 he began {{regularly}} riding Alpine Valley; he would never leave regardless of the weather conditions. The dedication put forth caused Burton to notice him {{at the age of}} 7 resulting in sponsorship. In 2010, he placed first in the Burton Open Junior Jam which skyrocketed him to new heights.|$|E
50|$|In 1977, {{during a}} time when he was furloughed from Trans World Airlines, Dengler {{returned}} to Laos and was greeted as a celebrity by the Pathet Lao. He was taken to the camp from which he had escaped and was surprised to discover that at one point he and Martin had been within {{a mile and a half}} of it. His fascination with airplanes and aviation continued for the remainder of his life. He continued flying almost up until his death. He took advantage of an early-retirement offer as a pilot for TWA sometime prior to 1985, but continued flying his meticulously restored Cessna 195, putting it on static display at numerous California air shows. In 2000, Dengler was inducted into the Gathering of Eagles program and told the story of his escape to groups of young military officers. Dengler was diagnosed with ALS, an incurable neurological disorder; on February 7, 2001, he rolled his wheelchair from his house <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> of a fire station and shot himself. He was buried in Arlington National Cemetery. A Navy honor guard was present at the burial as well as a fly-over by Navy F-14 Tomcats.|$|R
5000|$|In a {{rural area}} of Santa Rosa, about 20 miles north of Petaluma, a {{babysitter}} returning home noted a suspicious vehicle stuck in a ditch on her employer's private <b>driveway.</b> She phoned <b>the</b> property owner, who decided to leave with her daughter. As she drove <b>down</b> <b>the</b> long <b>driveway</b> to Pythian Road, the owner passed the suspect. She called 911 {{when she got to}} a service station and two deputies were dispatched on the call. The deputies did not know of the kidnapping or the suspect's description, due to Sonoma Valley units being on Channel 3. The deputies ran the suspect's driver's license number and car plate number, but they came back with no wants or warrants. The deputies tried to convince the property owner to perform a citizen's arrest for trespassing. Under California law, a citizen must make an arrest for this type of misdemeanor. The property owner would have {{had to go to the}} car with the deputies and say [...] "I arrest you." [...] The deputies then would have taken him into custody. The property owner refused.|$|R
50|$|One day at Crimson Lights Coffee House, Tony met {{college student}} Megan Dennison. He took an instant liking {{to her and}} {{thought she was a}} welcome relief from the {{manipulative}} Grace. Tony and Megan began dating, much to the disapproval of Megan's father, Keith and her sister, Tricia. When Megan defiantly told Keith {{that she was going to}} keep seeing Tony despite what he thought, Tricia became unhealthily obsessed with breaking them up. Her efforts were futile. On Tony and Megan's wedding day, Megan became concerned when the groom did not show up. Speeding to stop the wedding, Tricia had blindly run Tony <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> Dennisons' <b>driveway.</b> Tony was rushed to hospital and married Megan moments before passing away.|$|R

50|$|Moore {{was killed}} {{at his home}} in Holmdel, New Jersey, one morning in early June 1988 when his four-wheel drive vehicle began to roll <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> Caught off guard, he {{attempted}} to stop it but was dragged under and pinned there.

50|$|When Oscar wakes up, Wilder is gone. Not {{wanting to}} see his dad, Oscar goes to his mother's house and he finally confronts her for abandoning him when she {{divorced}} his father. He admits that he always feels alone and unwanted but his mother comforts him and suggests that he stay with her. Oscar suddenly realises that he has left Buffy at his dad's and immediately goes to retrieve her. He climbs through a window into his room and finds that his father has destroyed it. Hearing the noise, his dad {{opens the door and}} refuses to tell Oscar where Buffy is, to which Oscar coldly says that his dad should not be surprised that everyone in his life leaves him. He goes <b>down</b> to <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> and finds <b>the</b> rest of his stuff in a pile. His mother arrives in her car and she and Oscar's dad begin fighting while he looks through his possessions and finds Buffy's dead body. He begins to feel a pain in his stomach again and hallucinates a metal rod bursting out of him. He pulls it out of his stomach, hits it against a nearby pile of wood and threatens his dad with it, forcing him to hide inside the house. Oscar then ties the metal rod around the door handle, locking his dad inside.|$|R
5000|$|The anti-castrists {{know the}} plane was heading to Florida and now think that LeRoy and Chaz are spies sent to give away {{the secret of the}} island base and presumed invasion. Saxon and Dillman {{assemble}} a large number of armed men and proceed to search for and locate LeRoy and Chaz throughout the Florida Everglades. When Chaz and LeRoy return home they try to re-adjust to civilian life. They thumb a ride with a teenage boy who {{is on his way to}} school and drives a suped-up hotrod car. The boy, who has fantasies of joining the army himself, converses with and gives Chaz and LeRoy a crazy high-speed ride through the back country dropping them off in town. Afterward they go to a diner where the latest music from Del Shannon ("Runaway") and Ronnie Dawson ("Decided By The Angels") is playing on a jukebox and they encounter two young high school girls with a stationwagon. The boys go to a secluded spot with the girls and 'score' with the girls before they go off to school. However the boys are not off the plane too long before Saxon's armed men, having identified them in the diner, are chasing and shooting at them in the night. LeRoy makes it out of the first ambush and gets back to his parents home. Chaz loses contact with him but survives the ambush. The next morning Chaz is searching for LeRoy when a fancy convertible driven by an attractive and rich young woman named Sallie Mae stops to give him a lift. Sallie Mae at first refuses to take Chaz to LeRoy's parents house and he then threatens to cut up her car seats with a penknife if she abandons him on the road. Sallie Mae then consents to take Chaz to LeRoy's parents house deep in the Everglades swamp where her car breaks <b>down</b> in <b>the</b> <b>driveway.</b> LeRoy, Chaz and now Sallie Mae are reunited and it's learned LeRoy's father [...] "Pa" [...] Beecher (Lonny Chapman) runs an illegal Moonshine operation. The Beechers, Pa and Ma, have been out shopping and return to encounter Chaz and Sallie Mae who helps Ma Beecher with the groceries. Pa Beecher's temper hits the roof when he sees Sallie Maes broken <b>down</b> convertible in <b>the</b> <b>driveway</b> as it easily gives away the location of his home and that he's running an illegal liquor operation. The soldiers track Chaz and LeRoy to LeRoys's parents home after spotting Sallie Mae's car.|$|R
