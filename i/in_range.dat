40|$|We analyse the SoftKinetic DepthSense 325 {{range imaging}} camera for {{precision}} and accuracy <b>in</b> <b>ranging</b> out to 3 m. Flat planar targets (one a grey board, the other made from retroreflective material) are imaged {{at a variety of}} distances. Straight-forward image processing is used to identify the target and calculate the range and the root mean square variation <b>in</b> <b>ranging</b> to the target. It is found that inaccuracies <b>in</b> <b>ranging</b> of up to 2 cm occur to the grey board when imaging over 0 m to 1. 5 m and the precision <b>in</b> <b>ranging</b> degrades from just below 1 cm at 0 m to almost 10 cm at 1. 5 m. Similar inaccuracies occur with the retroreflective target but the precision is always under 1 cm even out to 3 m due to the strong signal return received from the target...|$|R
5|$|Alisia {{attacks by}} {{shooting}} streaks of lightning from her hands. The attack automatically targets enemies <b>in</b> <b>range</b> but gets weaker with each volley as Alisia's power is depleted. Her power recharges when she stops attacking; when fully charged, it {{allows her to}} unleash a multi-target attack, hitting every enemy on the screen. The energy system introduces an element of strategy, encouraging the player to manage Alisia's power to have her able to defend herself at critical moments.|$|E
5|$|Analysis of {{mitochondrial}} DNA, from {{a limited}} number of specimens, suggested that there was gene flow within the continental Asian populations until the 20th century reductions <b>in</b> <b>range,</b> and that Australia was colonized only in the Late Pleistocene, some 35,000 years ago. This has been corroborated by nDNA microsatellite analyses with four times the sample size. This study further suggests that the Australian population is quite inbred. As there exists the possibility of (limited) hybridization with the genetically distinct brolga, the Australian sarus crane can be expected to be an incipient species.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} of human {{settlement}} of the Americas, the California condor was widespread across North America; condor bones from the late Pleistocene have been found at the Cutler Fossil Site in southern Florida. However, {{at the end of}} the last glacial period came the extinction of the megafauna that led to a subsequent reduction <b>in</b> <b>range</b> and population. Five hundred years ago, the California condor roamed across the American Southwest and West Coast. Faunal remains of condors have been found documented in Arizona, Nevada, New Mexico, and Texas. The Lewis and Clark Expedition of the early 19th century reported on their sighting and shooting of California condors near the mouth of the Columbia River.|$|E
5000|$|The {{preference}} for an en dash {{instead of a}} hyphen <b>in</b> <b>ranges</b> {{is a matter of}} style preference, not inherent orthographic [...] "correctness"; both are equally [...] "correct", and each is the preferred style in some style guides. For example, APA style uses an en dash <b>in</b> <b>ranges,</b> but AMA style uses a hyphen.|$|R

5|$|Data {{from the}} {{captured}} Zero had been {{transmitted to the}} U.S. Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics (BuAer) and Grumman Aircraft. After careful study, Roy Grumman decided that he could match or surpass the Zero in most respects, except <b>in</b> <b>range,</b> without sacrificing pilot armor, self-sealing tanks and fuselage structure. The new F6F Hellcat would compensate for the extra weight with additional power.|$|E
5|$|Exclusion of all {{elements}} {{is based on}} properties of earlier actinides, which show a much wider variety of chemistry (for instance, <b>in</b> <b>range</b> of oxidation states) within their series than the lanthanides, and comparisons to scandium and yttrium are even less useful. However, these elements are destabilized, {{and if they were}} stabilized to more closely match chemistry laws, they would be similar to lanthanides as well. Also, the later actinides from californium onwards behave more like the corresponding lanthanides, with only the valence +3 (and sometimes +2) shown.|$|E
5|$|Four {{other species}} of hammerhead sharks overlap <b>in</b> <b>range</b> with the smalleye hammerhead: the small-sized scoophead and bonnethead, and the large-sized {{scalloped}} hammerhead and great hammerhead. Little competition occurs between these species because of their differing habitats and dietary preferences. The smalleye hammerhead is the dominant hammerhead in shallow, muddy areas, where high turbidity limits the utility of vision (hence its smaller eyes). Adult males and juveniles of both sexes form schools of uniform body size; these schools {{do not appear to}} relate to reproduction or migration. Adult females are apparently solitary.|$|E

5|$|On 4 June 1927, a {{crowd of}} 7,000 well-wishers saw City of Honolulu depart on her maiden voyage. The festivities were also {{broadcast}} on radio station KGFO, a portable station operating form the front cargo deck of the ship. During the journey, broadcasts of the City of Honolulus orchestra, along with radio personalities and musicians from Los Angeles station KHJ, entertained both passengers and listeners on shore (while the ship was <b>in</b> <b>range).</b>|$|E
5|$|On 7 January 1783, Concorde was {{in company}} with Nymphe. They sighted HMS Raven, which {{initially}} sailed towards them until {{she realized that}} they were not British frigates. An all-day chase ensued until about 9p.m. when one of the frigates got within pistol-shot and fired a broadside that took away Ravens main topgallant-mast. The chase continued until about 10:30p.m. when one of the frigates was again <b>in</b> <b>range,</b> with the other coming up rapidly. At this point, Raven, which was under the command of Commander John Wells, struck. The French Navy took Raven into service under the name Cérès, which she had born when under French colours between 1778 and 1782.|$|E

5|$|On defense, he led AL second basemen <b>in</b> <b>range</b> factor/9 innings (5.09), and was 2nd in putouts (303) and assists (432), and was 5th in fielding {{percentage}} (.988) {{and double}} plays (109). Following the season, Kinsler {{was named the}} Gold Glove Award winner for second base, {{the first of his}} career. Kinsler and Dustin Pedroia finished tied for the lead among AL second basemen in 2016 with 12 DRS. Kinsler's 8.5 UZR trailed only Pedroia (12.5). Through 2016, Kinsler had the best career range factor of any active second baseman in Major League Baseball.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a hostile}} ship is <b>in</b> <b>range,</b> the player {{will have the}} choice to either open fire or outmanoeuvre the enemy. The Bismarck is able to {{withstand}} 99 points of damage; internal fires may break out during battle and will risk destroying the ship if the fires are not contained quickly enough or if they reach fuel tanks. If fires occur, the player is given the option to order fire-fighting crews to contain the blaze, although it will cause the ship to disengage from combat. The game proceeds in real time, and has the option to change speed from slow to fast at any time.|$|E
5|$|One {{of the few}} {{resources}} not in short supply was petroleum oil; supplies intended for Europe were filling British storage facilities. Considerable effort and enthusiasm was put into making use of petroleum products as a weapon of war. The Army had not had flame-throwers since the First World War, but a significant number were improvised from pressure greasing equipment acquired from automotive repair garages. Although limited <b>in</b> <b>range,</b> they were reasonably effective.|$|E

5|$|Open country species, which {{comprise}} {{the majority of}} bee-eaters, have mostly expanded <b>in</b> <b>range</b> as more land is converted to agriculture, but some tropical forest species have suffered declines through loss of habitat, although no species or subspecies gives serious cause for concern. There is some human persecution of bee-eaters, with nest holes being blocked, adults shot or limed, or young taken for food. More generally problematic is the unintended destruction of nests. This can occur through cattle trampling, as with the blue-headed bee-eater in Kenya, or loss of forests, with massive conversion of native forest to oil palm plantations in Malaysia being particularly concerning.|$|E
5|$|The fulmarine petrels are generalists, {{which for}} the most part take many species of fish and crustacea. The giant petrels, uniquely for Procellariiformes, will feed on land, eating the carrion of other seabirds and seals. They will also attack the chicks of other seabirds. The diet of the giant petrels varies {{according}} to sex, with the females taking more krill and the males more carrion. All the fulmarine petrels readily feed on fisheries discards at sea, a habit that has been implicated in (but not proved to have caused) the expansion <b>in</b> <b>range</b> of the northern fulmar in the Atlantic.|$|E
