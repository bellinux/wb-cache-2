So though Liv slaps Alex when he rolls the die and kisses her, she's really grateful for the distraction. Liv is disgusted when she finds out that people who didn't even know Grace are holding a memorial service for her and is adamant that the friends not attend the service. Mini and Liv argue and Liv rushes off crying. She is followed by Alex, but when he tries to comfort her, she kisses him. Alex stops her and tells her he's gay. Liv becomes even more distraught and Alex tries to explain that he's never had friends before. Liv yells at him that they're not friends and Mini arrives to add that [...] "we don't need you." [...] Liv, Mini, and Franky end up attending Grace's memorial service, but are disgusted by the shallow and over-the-top display and Liv ends up smashing things up and screaming at the other students, culminating in Liv yelling at everyone [...] "wank over this!", flashing them and then storming off. Alex takes the gang out on a sailboat for a [...] "party", when really he just wants to bury his dead grandmother at sea. While on the boat, Alex encourages Liv to talk to Mini, but Mini once again pushes Liv away. As the boys slide the coffin into the ocean, the gang becomes very emotional, their feelings about Grace welling up. Alex and Liv share another kiss, but it is platonic and they agree to be friends.
