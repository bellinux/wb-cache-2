The wall {{must be prepared}} to charge down the ball once it has been touched by the free-kick taker, and other defenders must be alert to the attacking team's practised set-plays. Getting the ball over the wall and then to dip into the bottom corner is a superb skill. Xherdan Shaqiri approaches the ball from a 90 <b>degrees</b> <b>angle</b> which is very effective.|$|E
500|$|The Gripen is a multirole fighter aircraft, {{intended}} as a lightweight and agile aerial platform with advanced, highly adaptable avionics. It has canard control surfaces that contribute a positive lift force at all speeds, while the generous lift from the delta wing compensates for the rear stabilizer producing negative lift at high speeds, increasing induced drag. [...] Being intentionally unstable and employing digital fly-by-wire flight controls to maintain stability removes many flight restrictions, improves maneuverability, and reduces drag. The Gripen also has good short takeoff performance, being able to maintain a high sink rate and strengthened to withstand the stresses of short landings. [...] A pair of air brakes are located {{on the sides of}} the rear fuselage; the canards also angle downward to act as air brakes and decrease landing distance. It is capable of flying at a 70–80 <b>degrees</b> <b>angle</b> of attack.|$|E
500|$|The heavy armour and {{powerful}} long-range gun gave the Tiger II an advantage against all opposing Western Allied and Soviet tanks attempting to engage it from head on. This was especially true on the Western Front where, until {{the arrival of}} the few M26 Pershings in 1945 and the few M4A3E2 Sherman [...] "Jumbo"s that were scattered around Europe after D-Day, neither the British nor US forces brought heavy tanks into service. A Wa Prüf 1 report estimated that the Tiger II's frontal aspect was impervious to the 122mm D-25T, the heaviest although not the best penetrating tank gun on the Allied side. On the other hand, an R.A.C 3.d. document of February 1945 estimated that the British QF 17-pounder (76.2 mm) gun, using armour-piercing discarding sabot shot was theoretically capable of penetrating the front of the Tiger II's turret and nose (lower front hull) at [...] respectively although, given the lack of a stated angle, this is presumably at the ideal 90 <b>degrees</b> <b>angle.</b> Some sources claimed that there is no proof that the front armour of the King Tiger was ever penetrated in combat.|$|E

2500|$|The {{high angle}} of attack {{investigations}} on the Gulfstream II indicated that stable trim conditions existed up to 45 <b>degrees</b> <b>angle</b> of attack. [...] The elevator deflection required to trim to the primary stall at most forward center of gravity was sufficient to trim a deep stall at the aft center of gravity, but recovery from deep stall was immediate upon forward stick motion, and more than adequate nose-down elevator control was available.

Configuration buildup studies revealed the adverse nacelle influence on tail pitching moment contribution above 30 <b>degrees</b> <b>angle</b> of attack was not unduly severe and no appreciable effect on elevator or stabilizer effectiveness was found.|$|E
50|$|For a {{flux density}} or {{irradiance}} measurement it {{is required by}} definition that the response to “beam” radiation varies with the cosine of the angle of incidence; i.e. full response at when the radiation hits the sensor perpendicularly (normal to the surface, 0 <b>degrees</b> <b>angle</b> of incidence), zero response when the radiation is at the horizon (90 <b>degrees</b> <b>angle</b> of incidence, 90 degrees zenith angle), and 0.5 at 60 <b>degrees</b> <b>angle</b> of incidence.
