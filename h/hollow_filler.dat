40|$|Due to the {{hydrophilic}} {{nature of}} polyurethanes used in CMP pads, water from polishing slurries and rinse solutions {{is prone to}} diffuse into the pad matrix. In this study, theoretical and experimental methods are established to calculate the water diffusion coefficient and water diffusion profile within pad polymers. More hydrophilic pads show higher water uptake (3 to 5 wt%) and higher water diffusion coefficient, while less hydrophilic pads show lower water uptake (< 2 wt%) and lower diffusion rate. The storage modulus, hardness, and tensile properties of CMP pads are found to drop monotonically with increasing water uptake. More hydrophilic pads experience a greater reduction in mechanical strength than less hydrophilic pads. The shell of the <b>hollow</b> <b>filler</b> (used to impart porosity) is found {{to act as a}} relatively hydrophobic barrier that prevents water diffusion into the filler. At 25 ◦C and 50 ◦C—bracketing the bulk pad surface temperatures reached in typical CMP processes—pH shows no additional effects on pad mechanical properties beyond those of water alone. This finding indicates that acidic vs. basic slurries may be assessed for compatibility with pad materials solely in terms of water content...|$|E

The materials investigated contained either <b>hollow</b> ceramic <b>filler</b> particles or woven, continuous carbon/graphite fibers. Since the two particulate composites {{were considered to be}} isotropic, only one sample orientation was prepared. For the fiber composite, both longitudinal and planar orientations were studied. Once prepared, the samples were examined using reflected light microscopy. A number of microstructural features were evaluated qualitatively, including porosity and cracks, filler-matrix interfacial bonding, filler particle characteristics (shape, size, size distribution, and loading variation) and fiber characteristics (orientation, packing variation, and discontinuities) ...|$|R

40|$|Soap bubbles are {{a common}} {{interfacial}} fluid dynamics phenomenon having appli-cations such as buoyant <b>hollow</b> spherical <b>fillers</b> and flow visualization of large scale airflows. In contrast to the dynamics of liquid drops in gas and gas bubbles in liquid, the dynamics of soap bubbles has not been well documented, possibly because soap bubbles have gas-liquid-gas interfaces. Having the thin-liquid-film interface seems to alter {{the characteristics of the}} bubble/drop creation process. Thus, the main objec-tive {{of this study is to}} experimentally examine how airflow develops and interacts with the soap liquid film as the film stretches and finally collapses to pinch-off. A soap bubble blowing apparatus was constructed to consistently reproduce soap bubble blowing process with various soap ring sizes, and high-speed videography was utilized to investigate the blowing process. The minimum radius of the neck of the soap liquid tube was measured when approaching pinch-off. It is seen that the minimum neck radius is approximately proportional to the time left till pinch-off by a scaling exponent of about 2 / 3. The exponent is 1 / 3 for a gas bubble in liquid and 2 / 3 for a liquid drop in gas. This indicates that liquid drops collapse more slowly tha...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{emerging}} scarcity of oil resources associated with increase in oil prices, it is acceptable that the fossil sources of our energy supplywill be gradually replaced by renewable substrates. It comprises of intermittent energy {{sources such as}} solar, wind, etc. Biomass energy is considered {{as one of the}} most immediate and important renewable source for several reasons. The most important is that biomass energy can contribute to sustainable development with reduction in the emission of greenhouse gases. Moreover, biomass energy has a potential to produce new employment opportunities especially in the rural areas of the developing countries. Ethanol represents one ofthe major important source of renewable energy. Fermentation is an attractive process to produce ethanol from renewable biomass. In order to improve the efficiency of ethanol fermentation it is convenient to remove the produced ethanol from the fermentation broth periodically, to reducethe inhibitory effect of excess ethanol concentration. Existing techniques applied for the recovery of ethanol from fermentation broth are vacuum distillation, solvent extraction, gas stripping and membrane pervaporation. Amongst all, pervaporation is one of the most significant technique for the recovery of ethanol from the fermentation broth. It has many advantages over other techniques such as energy saving, cost effectiveness, and ecofriendly process. Pervaporation process comprises of amembrane for separation. It is unit operation in which two components are separated by using either polymeric or inorganic membrane through thecombination of different permeation rates of the components. Commonly, vacuum is applied to the downstream side of the membrane since, evaporative phase change occurs. The separation membrane is the key element in pervaporation equipments. Many membrane materials are considered for the purpose of recovering ethanol from dilute fermentation broth. Amongst these, hydrophobic membrane materials such as polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) is the promising option. Since, PDMS membranes are hydrophobic innature and has high diffusivity for the ethanol owing to its low Tg resulting from the free rotation of Si-O bond. Although, pure PDMS membranes are less efficient in ethanol recovery, their efficiency can be increased by incorporation of certain class of additives / fillers. Objective of the present proposal is to prepare hydrophobic PDMS composite membranes incorporated with fillers / additives for enhanced bio-ethanol recovery from the dilute fermentation broth. These composite membranes comprises of a porous layer ofan organolphilic polymer as a support, synthesized by phase inversion method (PIM). A thin film of dense PDMS polymer incorporated with <b>hollow</b> <b>fillers</b> such as (MOFs, Silicates, ZIFs, HS etc.) will be applied on the surface of porous support layer by using different techniques such as dip coating, spin coating etc. The nature of the fillers / additives to be incorporated in these membranes will be hollow centered with functional shells forming the outer part. The hollow central part will increase the permeability, while outer part with shells will act as sieve to increase the selectivity. These membranes will be characterized by different techniques (AFM, SEM, Contact angle etc.). The permeation study of these membranes will be performed in order to monitor their pervaporation performance using model ethanol feed solution. Finally, the membranes withbetter performance can be tested in actual bioethanol process with realistic feed solution. Owing to the dual nature of fillers / additivesincorporated in the membranes, these membranes will be tested in organic solvent nanofiltration and gas separation as well. nrpages: 156 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract]: With the {{increasing}} use of fibre reinforced polymer (FRP) composites in civil engineering structures, there is a growing realisation of the need to develop new structural systems which can utilise the unique characteristics of these materials in a more efficient and economical manner. In many instances this will require the development of new materials tailored to address the unique performance and economic parameters of mainstream construction. Over recent years, researchers at the University of Southern Queensland have pioneered the use of a new type of particulate filled polymer core material which greatly improves the robustness and cost effectiveness of FRP structural systems. These composite materials are composed of small <b>hollow</b> spherical <b>fillers</b> (microspheres) in a thermosetting polymer matrix. Initial research into these materials, including their feasibility in prototype structural elements, have shown these materials to have major potential for widespread application in structural composite systems. One of the most promising classes of these materials investigated to date are vinyl ester / cenosphere composites, which utilise cenospheres derived from fly ash in a vinyl ester matrix. Previously reported studies into these materials have been restricted to initial surveys of material behaviour which sought to identify key parameters in achieving desired performance outcomes in the composite. This dissertation presents the first in-depth investigation of these materials specifically as a core material option for civil infrastructure applications. The particular focus of this work is on the relationship of the vinyl ester matrix to the characteristics of the resulting composite. Several key matrix parameters were identified and assessed as to their influence on cure characteristics, fabrication operations, mechanical properties and the retention of such properties under elevated service temperatures. The outcomes of this work have significantly improved the understanding of matrix influences on the behaviour of these composite systems and have been drawn together to provide a number of recommendations on the application of this new technology to new structural systems...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} investigation {{exploring the}} use of wire mesh/hollow glass microsphere combination for use as thermal insulation was conducted with the aim to conclude {{whether or not it}} represents a superior insulation technology to those on the market. Three primary variables, including number of wire mesh layers, filler material, and temperature dependence were studied using an apparatus that was part of L. I. C. H. E. N (LabVIEW Integrated Conduction Heat Experiment Network), a setup whose basic components allow three vertically stacked samples to be thermally and mechanically controlled. Knowing the temperature profile in the upper and lower samples allows for determination of thermal conductivity of the middle material through {{the use of}} Fourier?s law. The numbers of layers investigated were two, four, six, and eight, with each separated by a metallic liner. The filler materials included air, s 15, s 35 and s 60 HS 3 MTM hollow glass microspheres. The experiments were conducted at four temperatures of 300, 330, 366, and 400 K with an interface pressure of 20 Psi. The experimental results indicated the ?number of layers? used was the primary factor in determining the effective thermal conductivity value. The addition of hollow glass microspheres as filler material resulted in statistically insignificant changes in effective thermal conductivity. Increasing the number of wire mesh layers resulted in a corresponding increase in effective thermal conductivity of the insulation. Changes in temperature had little to no effect on thermal conductivity. The effective thermal conductivity values for the proposed insulation structure ranged from 0. 22 to 0. 65 W/m-K, the lowest of which came from the two layer case having air as filler material. The uncertainties associated with the experimental results fell between 10 to 20 percent in all but a few cases. In the best performing cases, when compared with existing insulation technologies, thermal conductivity was approximately 3 to 10 times higher than these methods of insulation. Thus, the proposed insulation scheme with <b>hollow</b> glass-sphere <b>filler</b> material does not represent superior technology, and would be deemed uncompetitive with those readily available in the insulation market...|$|R
40|$|Solvent {{resistant}} nanofiltration (SRNF) {{involves the}} separation of an organic mixture down to a molecular level by simply applying a pressure gradient over a membrane. Since this process is energy- and waste-efficient, {{it has the potential}} to compete with other less environmentally friendly processes such as solvent extraction and distillation, which are now abundantly used in the (petro) chemical, food and pharmaceutical industries. However, to turn SRNF into a viable industrial process, excellent membranes should become available, combining chemical, mechanical and thermal stability with good rejections and sufficiently high fluxes. This work focuses on the improvement of SRNF membranes and membrane processes, more specifically aiming at enhanced membrane fluxes. The research is based on three different concepts: (i) chemical crosslinking to increase the membrane stability, (ii) MMMs containing <b>hollow</b> selective <b>fillers</b> to increase both fluxes and selectivities and (iii) membranes that can be activated via a photo-thermal process to increase fluxes. Polyimide-based membranes are resistant to a broad range of solvents, but dissolve in aprotic solvents such as N,N-dimethylformamide and N-methylpyrrolidon, which are common polymer solvents. The chemical cross-linking of asymmetric polyimide membranes by a post-synthesis reaction with p-xylylenediamine in a methanol environment is studied, aiming at an improved membrane stability in these solvents. The influence of this straightforward post-treatment on membrane stability, morphology and performance in aprotic solvent based feeds is investigated. The crosslinking treatment is also performed on nano-zeolite filled polyimide membranes. Next to crosslinking as a post-treatment, another method is explored wherein the crosslinking reaction is combined with the phase inversion process by adding the crosslinker to the aqueous coagulation bath. This eliminates the need of an extra methanol-based production step. Membranes prepared by these two methods are thoroughly characterized and the crosslinking efficiency of the methods is compared for reactions between different types of diamines and polyimides. The main parameters influencing the rate of crosslinking for each method are also determined. In addition to increasing the chemical stability of SRNF membranes, enhancing their permeability is another critical issue. The crosslinked polyimide membranes are further tested as support for zeolite-filled polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) membranes to be used in solvents such as toluene en ethyl acetate. While PDMS usually swells in these solvents, drastically reducing the membrane selectivity, the zeolites reinforce the polymer matrix and reduce the swelling. They also introduce a higher selectivity due to their molecular sieving abilities. As a new concept, aiming at further increasing solvent fluxes, micron-sized hollow spheres with zeolitic shell are used as inorganic fillers in the PDMS mixed matrix membranes. The membranes are characterized and tested in SRNF and their performance iscompared to membranes filled with more conventional zeolite crystals. Finally, a completely new strategy is presented to achieve local heating of a membrane during a separation process, in order to realize a flux increase without affecting the membrane selectivity. By incorporating gold nanoparticles into the membrane structure, it is possible to heat the membrane during the separation process by light irradiation, applying the principle of photo-thermal heating. To prove this concept, gold nanoparticles are generated inside a pre-made cellulose acetate membrane by chemical reduction of gold salts. The effect of the photo-thermal heating by the gold nanoparticles on the membrane temperature, flux and selectivity is investigated by irradiation with a continuous wave laser in a specially adapted filtration cell. As for polyimide membranes, good selectivities for very small compounds are often combined with very low fluxes, the photo-thermal heating method may specifically be a solution for such membranes. To prepare polyimide membranes containing gold nanoparticles, two different synthesis methods are explored: one via in-situ reduction of a gold salt in the membrane matrix and another via the use of preformed polymer-protected gold nanoparticles. The influence of the synthesis method on the nanoparticle size, dispersion and surface plasmon behavior is investigated, as well as the influence on the membrane structure and performance. The effect of the concentration of the gold nanoparticles and the laser intensity on the photo-thermal heating effect, the temperature and the permeance behavior of the membrane are investigated for both methods. status: publishe...|$|R
