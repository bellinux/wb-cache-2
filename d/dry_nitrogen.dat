25|$|Commercial {{samples of}} zinc {{chloride}} typically contain water and products from hydrolysis as impurities. Such samples may be purified by recrystallization from hot dioxane. Anhydrous samples can be purified by sublimation {{in a stream}} of hydrogen chloride gas, followed by heating the sublimate to 400°C in a stream of <b>dry</b> <b>nitrogen</b> gas. Finally, the simplest method relies on treating the zinc chloride with thionyl chloride., ZnCl2, CdCl2, ThCl4, CrCl3, FeCl3, CoCl2, and NiCl2 from the corresponding hydrates.|$|E
25|$|To reduce {{errors in}} sensing {{attitude}} and velocity, designers cut friction {{to a minimum}} in the platform gyros and accelerometers by floating the bearings on a thin film of <b>dry</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> The nitrogen was supplied from a sphere holding 2 cu ft (56.6 l) of gas at 3,000 psig (pounds per square inch gauge, i.e. psi above one atmosphere) (20,7 MPa). This sphere is 21inches (0,53 m) in diameter and is mounted at location 22, {{to the left of}} the ST-124-M3. Gas from the supply sphere passes through a filter, a pressure regulator, and a heat exchanger before flowing through the bearings in the stable platform.|$|E
2500|$|ESI {{interface}} for LC-MS systems {{was developed}} by Fenn and collaborators in 1988. This ion source/ interface [...] {{can be used for}} the analysis of moderately polar molecules (e.g., metabolites, xenobiotics, and peptides). The liquid eluate coming out of the LC column is pumped through a metal capillary kept at 3 to 5 kV. The liquid is nebulized {{at the tip of the}} capillary and a fine spray of charged droplets is formed. To avoid contamination, this capillary is usually perpendicularly located at the inlet of the MS system. The heat created by the electric potential is used to rapidly evaporate the droplets in an atmosphere of <b>dry</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> Later, the ionized analytes are transferred into the high vacuum chamber of the MS as the charged ions flow through a series of small apertures with the aid of focusing voltages. Positively and negatively charged ions can be detected and it is possible to switch between the negative and positive modes of operation. Most ions produced in the ESI interface are multiply charged. The use of 1–3nbsp&mm ID microbore columns is recommended for LC-MS systems using electrospray ionization (ESI) interfaces because optimal operation [...] is achieved with flow rates in the 50-200 μl/min range.|$|E

Prior to Pt deposition, the wafers were chemically cleaned using piranha cleaning {{followed by an}} HF dip, rinsing in aceton, isopropanol and deionized water and <b>drying</b> in <b>nitrogen</b> gas flow. When removed from the solution, the samples were again rinsed in deionized water and <b>dried</b> in <b>nitrogen</b> gas flow.|$|R

Samples were analyzed on a Thermo-Finnigan Trace DSQ™ fast-scanning single-quadrupole mass spectrometer using {{electron impact ionization}} (EI) and operated at unit mass resolving power. The scan range was from 50 – 750  m/z (Brown et al. 2016).|$|R

2500|$|... {{is used in}} the {{electrical}} industry as a gaseous dielectric medium for high-voltage circuit breakers, switchgear, and other electrical equipment, often replacing oil filled circuit breakers (OCBs) that can contain harmful PCBs. [...] gas under pressure is used as an insulator in gas insulated switchgear (GIS) because it has a much higher dielectric strength than air or <b>dry</b> <b>nitrogen.</b> The high dielectric strength {{is a result of the}} gas's high electronegativity and density. This property makes it possible to significantly reduce the size of electrical gear. This makes GIS more suitable for certain purposes such as indoor placement, as opposed to air-insulated electrical gear, which takes up considerably more room. Gas-insulated electrical gear is also more resistant to the effects of pollution and climate, as well as being more reliable in long-term operation because of its controlled operating environment. Exposure to an arc chemically breaks down [...] though most of the decomposition products tend to quickly re-form , a process termed [...] "self-healing". Arcing or corona can produce disulfur decafluoride (...) , a highly toxic gas, with toxicity similar to phosgene. [...] was considered a potential chemical warfare agent in World War II because it does not produce lacrimation or skin irritation, thus providing little warning of exposure.|$|E
2500|$|The {{satellite}} had a one-watt, [...] radio transmitting unit inside, {{developed by}} Vyacheslav I. Lappo from NII-885, the Moscow Electronics Research Institute, that worked on two frequencies, 20.005 and 40.002MHz. Signals {{on the first}} frequency were transmitted in 0.3 sec pulses (under normal temperature and pressure conditions on-board), with pauses of the same duration filled by pulses on the second frequency. Analysis of the radio signals was used to gather information about the electron density of the ionosphere. Temperature and pressure were encoded in the duration of radio beeps. A temperature regulation system contained a fan, a dual thermal switch, and a control thermal switch. If the temperature inside the satellite exceeded [...] the fan was turned on and when it fell below [...] the fan was {{turned off by the}} dual thermal switch. If the temperature exceeded [...] or fell below , another control thermal switch was activated, changing the duration of the radio signal pulses. Sputnik 1 was filled with <b>dry</b> <b>nitrogen,</b> pressurized to 1.3 atm. The satellite had a barometric switch, activated if the pressure inside the satellite fell below 130 kPa, which would have indicated failure of the pressure vessel or puncture by a meteor, and would have changed the duration of radio signal impulse.|$|E
2500|$|Voltage {{standing}} wave ratio (VSWR) measurements may be taken {{to ensure that a}} waveguide is contiguous and has no leaks or sharp bends. If such bends or holes in the waveguide surface are present, this may diminish the performance of both transmitter and receiver equipment connected at either end. Poor transmission through the waveguide may also occur as a result of moisture build up which corrodes and degrades conductivity of the inner surfaces, which is crucial for low loss propagation. For this reason, waveguides are nominally fitted with microwave windows at the outer end that will not interfere with propagation but keep the elements out. Moisture can also cause fungus build up or arcing in high power systems such as radio or radar transmitters. Moisture in waveguides can typically be prevented with silica gel, a desiccant, or slight pressurization of the waveguide cavities with <b>dry</b> <b>nitrogen</b> or argon. Desiccant silica gel canisters may be attached with screw-on nibs and higher power systems will have pressurized tanks for maintaining pressure including leakage monitors. Arcing may also occur if there is a hole, tear or bump in the conducting walls, if transmitting at high power (usually 200 watts or more). Waveguide plumbing [...] is crucial for proper waveguide performance. Voltage {{standing wave}}s occur when impedance mismatches in the waveguide cause energy to reflect back in the opposite direction of propagation. In addition to limiting the effective transfer of energy, these reflections can cause higher voltages in the waveguide and damage equipment.|$|E

30|$|As {{shown in}} Fig.  1 (b), {{streptavidin}} were self-assembled on the active {{area of the}} FBAR for detection of MUC 1 biomolecules. Firstly, the FBAR was successively sonicated with PBS solution, ethanol, and deionized water, followed by <b>drying</b> with <b>nitrogen</b> gas. Then, 2  mM mercaptopropionic acid was dropped in active zone and reacted for 1  h. Following, the resonator was washed with PBS solution and <b>dried</b> with <b>nitrogen</b> gas.
