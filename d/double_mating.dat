40|$|International audiencePost-copulatory {{paternity}} biases after female multiple mating {{are major}} constraints on {{both male and}} female reproductive systems. The outcome of paternity in certain situations is only controlled directly by male sperm stock. This was tested experimentally in the parasitoid wasp Anisopteromalus calandrae (Howard) (Hymenoptera: Pteromalidae), in which sperm stocks are small (several hundred) and the fertilizing efficiency of stored sperm is high (the ratio of sperm stored/fertilized eggs is about 0. 75). Sperm in seminal vesicles and paternity of males of different status (virgin young, virgin old, or young previously mated) were measured after female single and <b>double</b> <b>mating.</b> The amount of sperm in the seminal vesicle differed according to male status (increasing from previously mated males to old males), but {{there was no difference in}} sperm stored by females after a single mating. In <b>double</b> <b>mating</b> experiments with two males of different status, paternity increased linearly with the relative amount of sperm in seminal vesicles. Paternity distribution conforms to ‘a fair raffle' of sperm from both donors following complete mixing of sperm prior to fertilization. Thus, in a female multiple mating context, male fitness depends principally on their sperm stock, which in turn depends on life history parameters, such as age and previous mating...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY The aim of {{this study}} is to ascertain, when the time and {{frequency}} of mating should be carried out in Bali gilts to minimize embryonic mortality. A total of 18 Bali gilts and one mature Bali boar were used on this study. This study used Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with three treatments and six replications. Treatment 1 (T 1) was a single mating on day- 1 of estrous; Treatment 2 (T 2) was a single mating on day- 2 of estrous; Treatment 3 (T 3) was double matings on day- 1 and day- 2 of estrous. Calculations on the number and mortality of embryos were carried out on day- 25 of gestation. The percentage of embryonic mortality was known by calculating the difference between the number of corpora lutea in the ovary and the number of embryos the in uteruse divided by the number of corpora lutea in the ovary, multiplied by 100 %. The result of this study showed the average number of embryos in Bali gilts in T 1, T 2 and T 3 was 2. 66, 7. 00 and 7. 17 embryos, whereas the average mortality of embryos in T 1, T 2 and T 3 was 70. 14 %, 24. 45 %, and 21. 13 %, respectively. There was a significant (P < 0. 05) increase in the embryo number when a single mating was conducted on day- 2 of estrous and highly significant (P < 0. 01) when a <b>double</b> <b>mating</b> was conducted on day- 1 and day- 2 of estrous in Bali gilts.

Polyandrous females are hypothesized to gain genetic benefits for their offspring, but this assumes paternity bias favoring male genotypes that enhance offspring viability.

40|$|Sperm {{competition}} is {{the competition for}} fertilizations between ejaculates, within a female, following multiple mating. There are four sperm utilization or precedence patterns: first male precedence, where the first male to mate fertilizes most of the eggs laid by a female; last male precedence, where the last male to mate fertilizes most of the eggs laid by a female; "all-or-none" pattern, where sperm from either male fertilizes all the eggs laid by a female but which male's sperm that is used is random; or sperm mixing, where sperm from each male is used equally in fertilizing eggs laid by a female. Intermediate utilization patterns are also possible. Sperm competition occurs {{in a wide variety}} of insect species as well as other animals. This study was undertaken to study sperm competition in the field cricket, Gryllus integer. Four experiments were conducted: a radiation and sterilization experiment, a diapause experiment, and 2 competition experiments. It was found that 7, 000 rad of gamma radiation sterilized adult ~ integer males. There was no diapause in the laboratory in ~ integer eggs. In the first competition experiment, three groups of females were used: females mated with a normal male, then with a second normal male (NN group); females mated with a normal male, and then with a sterile male (NR group); and females mated with a sterile male, and then with a normal male (RN group). The results obtained from this experiment showed that the mean proportion of eggs hatched was significantly different between 3 groups of females, with the proportion hatched much greater in the NN group than in either the NR or RN groups. The pattern for the proportion of eggs hatched following a <b>double</b> <b>mating</b> most closely resembled a pattern expected if sperm mixing is occurring. Results obtained in the replicate competition experiment showed that the mean proportion of eggs hatched for the females in the NR group was significantly lower than the proportion hatched in the other two groups.

40|$|An early {{prediction}} of sperm competition {{theory was that}} males should adjust the number of sperm they deliver according {{to the risk of}} <b>double</b> <b>mating</b> and this has received empirical support in recent years. It has been suggested that adaptive regulation of sperm delivery in mammals may depend on changes in vas deferens contractility. In laboratory mice, the vas deferens is sensitive to opioid agonists and the secretion of endogenous opioid peptides can be affected by social interactions that may be predictive of sperm competition risk. The present experiment was conducted to determine whether morphine, an opioid agonist (at the mu-receptor), has different effects on electrically evoked contractions of the isolated vas deferens in two congeneric rodent species differing in sperm competition intensity. Morphine inhibited contractions of the vas deferens in the non-monogamous deer mouse (Peromyscus maniculatus) but not the monogamous California mouse (Peromyscus californicus).

A series of {{theoretical}} and experimental studies have suggested that polyandrous insects could avoid the cost of inbreeding via pre-copulatory mate choice and/or post-copulatory mechanisms. We looked for evidence of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance using female mate preference trials, in which females were given the choice of mating with either of two males, a sibling and a non-sibling. We also tested for evidence of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance by conducting <b>double</b> <b>mating</b> experiments, in which four sibling females were mated with two males sequentially, either two siblings, two non-siblings or a sibling and a non-sibling in either order. We identified substantial inbreeding depression: offspring of females mated to full siblings had lower hatching success, slower development time from egg to adult, lower survival of larval and pupal stages, and lower adult body mass than the offspring of females mated to non-sibling males. We also found evidence of pre-copulatory inbreeding avoidance, as females preferred to mate with non-sibling males. However, we did not find any evidence of post-copulatory inbreeding avoidance: egg hatching success of females mating to both sibling and non-sibling males were consistent with sperm being used without bias in relation to mate relatedness. Our results suggest that this cabbage beetle has evolved a pre-copulatory mechanism to avoid matings between close relative, but that polyandry is apparently not a...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Sex-ratio meiotic drive {{refers to}} the {{preferential}} transmission of the X chromosome by XY males. The loss of Y-bearing sperm is caused by an X-linked distorter and results in female-biased progeny. The fertility of sex-ratio (SR) males expressing the distorter is usually strongly reduced compared to wild-type males, especially {{when they are in}} competition. The aim {{of this study was to}} identify the post-copulatory mechanisms that lower the fertility of SR males in Drosophila simulans. Parameters contributing to male fertility were measured in single and <b>double</b> <b>mating</b> conditions. Results The most detrimental effect on SR males fertility is due to the size of their ejaculate which is half that of wild-type males. Sperm viability and sperm use by the females are also reduced. Sex-ratio males are poor sperm competitors in both offence and defence. We found evidence for sperm release from the female reproductive tract that specifically affects SR males. It results in the removal of stored sperm from a first SR mate without the action of the sperm of the second male. In addition, females mated once with an SR male remate more frequently with wild-type males. Conclusion The paternity reduction of SR males in competitive conditions is greater than that attributable to their low sperm production and could prevent the spread of distorter X chromosomes in populations when multiple mating occur. The female-driven mechanisms are shown to play a major role both throughout the post-copulatory selective process and increased polyandry. The variation in male reproductive performance may drive the evolution of sexual learning capability of females. </p...|$|E
40|$|Male {{seminal fluid}} {{proteins}} {{are known to}} affect female reproductive behavior and physiolo-gy by reducing mating receptivity and by increasing egg production rates. Such substances are also though to increase the competitive fertilization success of males, but the empirical foundation for this tenet is restricted. Here, we {{examined the effects of}} injections of size-fractioned protein extracts from male reproductive organs on both male competitive fertiliza-tion success (i. e., P 2 in <b>double</b> <b>mating</b> experiments) and female reproduction in the seed beetle Callosobruchus maculatus. We found that extracts of male seminal vesicles and ejaculatory ducts increased competitive fertilization success when males mated with fe-males 1 day after the females ’ initial mating, while extracts from accessory glands and tes-tes increased competitive fertilization success when males mated with females 2 days after the females ’ initial mating. Moreover, different size fractions of seminal fluid proteins had distinct and partly antagonistic effects on male competitive fertilization success. Collective-ly, our experiments show that several different seminal fluid proteins, deriving from different parts in the male reproductive tract and of different molecular weight, affect male competi-tive fertilization success in C. maculatus. Our results highlight the diverse effects of seminal fluid proteins and show that the function of such proteins can be contingent upon female mating status. We also document effects of different size fractions on female mating recep-tivity and egg laying rates, which can serve as a basis for future efforts to identify the molec-ular identity of seminal fluid proteins and their function in this model species...|$|E

40|$|In Drosophila melanogaster, mating radically {{transforms}} female {{physiology and}} behaviour. Post-mating responses include {{an increase in}} the oviposition rate, a reduction in female receptivity and an activation of the immune system. The fitness consequences of mating are similarly dramatic – females must mate once in order to produce fertile eggs, but additional matings have a clear negative effect. Previously, microarrays have been used to examine gene expression of females differing in their reproductive status with the aim of identifying genes influenced by mating. However, as only virgin and single mated females were compared, transcriptional changes associated with reproduction (under natural selection) and male-induced effects (possibly under sexually antagonistic selection) cannot be disentangled. We partitioned these fundamentally different effects by instead examining the expression profiles of virgin, single <b>mated</b> and <b>double</b> <b>mated</b> females. We found substantial effects relating to reproduction and further effects that are only attributable to mating itself. Immune response genes dominate this male-induced effect indicating that the cost of mating may be due partly to this system’s activation.

The relatedness between the queens and their mates was negative (R = - 0. 164 +/- 0. 044) and significantly different to zero (P = 0. 020). However, the high negative relatedness value {{was caused by a}} significant allele frequency difference between the sexes at a single locus (Lhum- 28). When this locus was removed from the analyses, the relatedness was not significantly different from zero (R = 0. 013 +/- 0. 050, P = 0. 812).

40|$|Abstract Background When females {{mate with}} {{different}} males, competition for fertilizations occurs after insemination. Such sperm competition is usually summarized {{at the level}} of the population or species by the parameter, P 2, defined as the proportion of offspring sired by the second male in <b>double</b> <b>mating</b> trials. However, considerable variation in P 2 may occur within populations, and such variation limits the utility of population-wide or species P 2 estimates as descriptors of sperm usage. To fully understand the causes and consequences of sperm competition requires estimates of not only mean P 2, but also intra-specific variation in P 2. Here we investigate within-population quantitative variation in P 2 using a controlled mating experiment and microsatellite profiling of progeny in the multiply mating stalk-eyed fly, Teleopsis dalmanni. Results We genotyped 381 offspring from 22 dam-sire pair families at four microsatellite loci. The mean population-wide P 2 value of 0. 40 was not significantly different from that expected under random sperm mixing (i. e. P 2 = 0. 5). However, patterns of paternity were highly variable between individual families; almost half of families displayed extreme second male biases resulting in zero or complete paternity, whereas only about one third of families had P 2 values of 0. 5, the remainder had significant, but moderate, paternity skew.

Thus the population mean P 2 value does not reflect the high underlying variance in familial P 2.

40|$|Whether and how {{individuals}} choose sequentially among mates {{is an important}} but largely neglected aspect in sexual selection studies. Here, we explore female remating behavior in the cellar spider Pholcus phalangioides. We focus on body size {{as one of the}} most important traits involved in mate choice. Large and small females (n = 216) were <b>double</b> <b>mated</b> with large or small males in all eight possible combinations. All females copulated when virgin, but only 82 % accepted a second male. The chance of a female remating was not significantly predicted by the body size of the second or first male or by the size difference between the two. In contrast, a previous study demonstrated a male size effect in that larger males monopolized females until egg laying when two males of different sizes were present. We suggest that sequential encounters are more common under natural conditions than male monopolization of females because estimates of concurrent multiple paternity together with observations in a natural population do not favor mate guarding as the predominant mating strategy in this species. It follows from our study that the intensity of sexual selection on male size may be greatly overestimated when using a competitive laboratory setting for a species in which females generally encounter mates in a sequential fashion. Female remating probability was significantly predicted by female size, with large females remating with higher probability than small females. Thus, when mating with large females, males may gain higher fertilization success through increased female fecundity but also face a higher sperm competition risk. Copyright 2005.

40|$|Evolutionary theory {{suggests}} that post-copulatory sexual selection {{plays an important role}} in the evolution of reproductive traits of sexually reproducing animals. But despite its alleged universality empirical evidence is scarce for sexual selection operating in simultaneous hermaphrodites. I therefore investigated the potential for post-copulatory sexual selection in such an organism. Sexual selection can also act on phenotypic plasticity of traits. Flexible adjustments of an individual’s own sex allocation have been proposed to be a major advantage of hermaphrodites compared to separate-sexed organisms. The simultaneous hermaphrodite M. lignano flexibly adjusts its sex allocation to group size. I aimed to narrow down the cues on which this flatworm relies to make this adjustment, and I measured the costs of such phenotypically plastic responses to group size. I tested for mate limitation in a natural population of this outcrossing hermaphrodite as one possibile condition where simultaneous hermaphroditism is advantageous. In a <b>double</b> <b>mating</b> experiment I revealed genetic variation in paternity success and in five traits. One of them, mating rate, significantly predicted paternity success. This trait has recently been shown to be phenotypically plastic. I here demonstrate that it also exhibits genetic variation. Hence, it might be subjected to sexual selection. The findings of multiple paternity and genetic variation in paternity success clearly suggest that there is an opportunity for sexual selection in this simultaneous hermaphrodite. I discuss possible mechanisms of sexual selection (sperm competition, female bias in favour of one sperm donor) and random paternity skews that may underlie the paternity patterns observed in this species. Further results suggest that the well-documented phenotypically plastic response in sex allocation was based on indirect cues for sperm competition such as tactile cues of group size rather than direct cues such as assessment of the partner’s mating status. I also demonstrate that this response incurred significant production costs of phenotypic plasticity. However, since the magnitude of these costs was relatively low, I argue that flexible adjustments of sex allocation may still convey a net benefit to simultaneous hermaphrodites. Mate availability did not appear to seriously limit female fitness in a natural habitat of M. lignano. This is consistent with classical sexual selection theory, originally developed for separate-sexed species. Specifically, one aspect of Bateman’s principle states that female fecundity is not limited by the availability of mating partners but by resources available for egg production, which seems to apply to this simultaneous hermaphrodite. I conclude that sexual selection occurs in this simultaneous hermaphrodite. I rule out two presumptive cues for the phenotypically plastic response to group size and demonstrate production costs of this plasticity. Finally, I judge the significance of phenotypic plasticity and mate availability for the evolution of simultaneous hermaphroditism. ...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} genomic {{conflicts}} raised by selfish {{elements in the}} ascomycete fungus Podospora anserina. Genomic conflicts arise when {{the effects of the}} selfish elements are opposite to the interests of the other parts of the genome. T wo types of selfish elements are studied as well as certain characteristics of Podospora involved in the population dynamics of these elements, such as vegetative and sexual incompatibility, senescence and outcrossing. The natural habitat of Podospora anserina is dung of herbivores where it has an optimum growth temperature of 27 °C. The fungus can only reproduce sexually and the ascospores are the products of meiosis as well as the next generation of the fungus. Perithecia or fruiting bodies contain asci with four linearly arranged ascospores, which provide unique opportunities to analyse abnormal segregation and makes this fungus one of the genetic model organisms. Most ascospores are capable of completing the lifecycle of the fungus, as they contain two nuclei, each with one of the two mating types. This fungal trait is called pseudo or secondairy homothallism, and it allows sexual offspring to be produced by either selfing or outcrossing. Sometimes smaller single mating type ascospores are formed containing one nucleus and less cytoplasmic content and mitochondria. Colonies from these spores must outcross with another isolate to produce offspring. The fungal isolates used in this thesis were sampled from dung around Wageningen, the Netherlands during 1990 - 1997, but also some older French isolates dating from 1937 were used. The first selfish elements studied in this thesis are linear plasmids with homology to pAL 2 - 1, a 8. 3 kb plasmid previously found in this fungus. Linear plasmids are parasitic autonomous replicating genetic elements. In filamentous fungi they reside in the mitochondria. Most plasmids are cryptic or have a negative fitness effect on the host. However the pAL 2 plasmid found in P. anserina has been associated with a longevity phenotype, though recently also negative effects were found. Homologous linear plasmids and plasmid families were present in 21 percent of the population and detected over several years. Half of the plasmid containing isolates possessed a single plasmid and the other half a plasmid family consisting of multiple plasmid copies. T he lifespan of the isolates was generally uncorrelated with the presence of the plasmid. One isolate showed an increased lifespan, but no inserted plasmid sequences were detected in the mitochondrial DNA, as was the case for the longevity inducing pAL 2 - 1 plasmid. We have looked at the dynamics of plasmid transmission for these plasmids. Vertical transfer of the plasmids to the ascospores occurs only via the maternal line. This transfer is inefficient as up to 40 % lose all plasmids in an outcrossing situation and up to 20 % retain only the basic plasmid family member in presence of a plasmid family. No difference in efficiency of plasmid transfer to the dikaryotic and the smaller monokaryotic ascospores was detected. Plasmid transmission was also found independent of the genetic background of the strains. Loss of plasmids via the sexual route is compensated by horizontal transmission of the plasmid through hyphal contact between different isolates. Horizontal transfer occurs efficiently in both vegetative compatible and incompatible situations. Vegetative incompatibility can be macroscopically observed as a 'barrage', a contact zone of lysed hyphal cells. Vegetative incompatibility is thought to have evolved as a mechanism to hamper spread of mobile selfish elements and parasites. Our experiments show that vegetative incompatibility is not a perfect barrier against this type of selfish elements. The other selfish elements studied in this thesis are meiotic drive factors or segregation distorters. Segregation distorters are transmitted into the progeny in excess of the fair Mendelian proportion of 50 %, by actively destructing the alternative allele. Genomic conflicts arise by hitchhiking of genes with deleterious fitness effects. Meiotic drive in Podospora is characterized by the abortion of two of the four spores in the ascus. S even different groups of meiotic drive elements or Spore killer types were identified and characterized. Among 99 isolates from nature, six of these meiotic drive elements occurred in our local population. All drive elements comprise 23 % of the natural population of P. anserina in Wageningen, The Netherlands and most elements can be retrieved over the years. Spore-killer type Psk- 7 was also present in a French strain dating from 1937 and exists for more than 60 years. No resistance to meiotic drive was observed and all other isolates found so far are sensitive to spore killing. Each type of Spore killer differs in the percentage of asci that show killing, ranging from 50 to 95 % two-spored asci, and in their mutual interactions. The aborted ascospores quickly degrade after spore wall formation, except for the Psk- 3 group where they remain visible as tiny shriveled ascospores, indicating different abortion factors or timing for killing. The Psk- 3 group also shows a variable percentage of two-spored asci within each perithecium. Spore-killer interactions show either mutual resistance (i. e. no abortion is found if an allele of either Spore killer is present) or dominant epistasis (i. e. one killer acts as a sensitive type). Genetic mapping could assign most Spore-killer types to linkage group III where they are not tightly linked to the centromere. Several possible models that explain the spore killing mechanism in Podospora anserina were examined. Repeated backcrossing of Spore killers to the same sensitive isolate produces strains with the same genetic background. Spore killers that belong to the same killer type or show mutual resistance become vegetative compatible to each other during backcrosses. On the other hand, Spore killers that show dominant epistasis, as well as the sensitive strain remained vegetative incompatible. This suggests a common mechanism for spore killing, possibly related to vegetative incompatibility, although the precise genetic nature of the correlation is not yet clear. The Podospora genome was screened for homologues of genes known to be involved in silencing in fungi. Genes were found for all silencing mechanisms (RIP, MSUD, Quelling) known in the related fungus Neurospora. However, the possible role of silencing by methylation of genes during the killing process was excluded by experiments using the drug 5 -azacytidine, which both removes methylation and prevents de-novo methylation. No effect of the 5 -azacytidine treatments was found on spore-killing frequency for all Spore-killer types. Also the consequences of formation of dikaryotic ascospores for expression of spore killing were examined. Crosses were used of Spore killers with a marker that increases the number of monokaryotic spores to up to eight. Spore-killer types Psk- 2, Psk- 3 (Wa 27) and Psk- 4 produced some asci containing more than four spores in these crosses. In such asci sensitive nuclei were able to survive and resist the meiotic drive system, indicating incomplete penetrance of the spore-killing mechanism. Spore killing in the other killer types (Psk- 1, Psk- 5, Psk- 6 and Psk- 7) were full penetrant; only asci with four or less spores could be detected. Here the killing mechanism works similar on all asci. Furthermore the effect of low temperatures (22 ºC) on spore killing was tested in this Chapter. Psk- 2 dramatically decreased the percentage of killing at this temperature to almost zero. Other Spore-killer types were not affected by temperature. Based on all characteristics and interactions of the Spore killers we propose that spore killing in Podospora may be an example of post-segregational killing due to Toxin-Antitoxin mechanisms. A Spore Killer produces both a persisting stable toxin and a less stable antitoxin. In ascospores where the Spore Killer is absent the antitoxin disappears more quickly than the toxin, leading to abortion of the spores. Variable killing percentages {{can be explained by the}} strict balance between toxin and antitoxin and the timing of shutdown of the genes involved. Meiotic drive is only possible in an outcrossing situation. Podospora is in principle capable of both outcrossing and selfing. However to what extent the fungus outcrosses in nature is unknown. The likelihood of outcrossing was assessed for the secondary homothallic ascomycete Podospora anserina.   We examined the extent of vegetative en sexual compatibility between wild type strains. The number of vegetative compatibility groups (VCG's) in the population was estimated based on the incompatibility reactions between isolates in our survey using accumulation curve extrapolation and the non-parametric Chao 1 formula. The estimated number of VCG's compared to the maximum number of VCG's based on the currently known vegetative incompatibility genes suggest regular outcrossing in this fungus. Also the difference in sexual compatibility reactions of mating types of the same isolate assumes outcrossing takes place. Options for outcrossing in P. anserina were experimentally verified. Both single mating type monokaryotic and dikaryotic <b>double</b> <b>mating</b> type mycelial cultures proved capable of outcrossing, showing no preference for either genotype. This indicates that fertilization by selfing and outcrossing uses the same pathway. Outcrossing percentages between 1 - 5 percent were found in unmanipulated natural situations of ascospores on dung. The number of monokaryotic ascospores found in Spore-killer (Psk) strains was significantly higher than in other isolates, showing an enhancement to outcrossing in these strains. The findings in this thesis contribute to the understanding of the population dynamics and evolution of two types of selfish elements, linear plasmids and segregation distorters, in the ascomycete fungus Podospora anserina. Furthermore it increases the knowledge on genomic conflicts caused by these types of selfish elements in genera...|$|E

Conversely, the sterility of ste 4, ste 5, ste 7, ste 11, and ste 12 mutants was not suppressed by gpa 1, but the lethal phenotype of gpa 1 was suppressed by these ste mutations.

40|$|Abstract Background Monogynous mating {{systems with}} {{extremely}} low male mating rates have several independent evolutionary origins and {{are associated with}} drastic adaptations involving self-sacrifice, one-shot genitalia, genital damage, and termination of spermatogenesis immediately after maturation. The combination of such extreme traits likely restricts evolutionary potential perhaps {{up to the point}} of making low male mating rates irreversible and hence may constitute an evolutionary dead end. Here, we explore the case of a reversion to multiple mating from monogynous ancestry in golden orb-web spiders, Nephila senegalensis. Results Male multiple mating is regained by the loss of genital damage and sexual cannibalism but spermatogenesis is terminated with maturation, restricting males to a single loading of their secondary mating organs and a fixed supply of sperm. However, males re-use their mating organs and by experimentally mating males to many females, we show that the sperm supply is divided between copulations without reloading the pedipalps. Conclusion By portioning their precious sperm supply, males achieve an average mating rate of four females which effectively <b>doubles</b> the maximal <b>mating</b> rate of their ancestors. A heritage of one-shot genitalia does not completely restrict the potential to increase mating rates in Nephila although an upper limit is defined by the available sperm load. Future studies should now investigate how males use this potential in the field and identify selection pressures responsible for a reversal from monogynous to polygynous mating strategies. </p...|$|R
40|$|Female mate {{preference}} {{can have}} important fitness consequences for females through {{direct or indirect}} benefits of mate choice. However, the existence and benefits of mate choice in species that perform dissociated sperm transfer is largely unknown. In the springtail Orchesella cincta, receptive females locate and take up spermatophores deposited in the litter layer by males, without even meeting their partner. We investigated female sexual selection and its benefits in O. cincta. We performed female choice trials with manipulated spermatophore density and diversity to assess female preference for different spermatophore deposition patterns. Furthermore we tested whether females benefit from choosing between spermatophores by measuring several reproductive variables of females assigned to single male (no choice) and <b>double</b> male (choice) <b>mating</b> treatments. Our results show that females chose patches with four spermatophores over patches with a single spermatophore, but did not discriminate between patches of three spermatophores from a single male or from three different males. The mating experiment showed that O. cincta females gained indirect benefits from choosing between spermatophores of different males, because male offspring resulting from the double male treatment produced more spermatophores than the male offspring from females without a choice. No evidence was found for direct benefits of female choice, {{because there were no}} differences in clutch size, egg size or offspring survival between treatments. Despite the large number of studies on female mate choice, {{this is the first time}} that indirect benefits have been demonstrated in a species with dissociated sperm transfer. © 2009 The Association for the Study of Animal Behaviour...|$|R
40|$|Competition among {{individuals}} {{for access to}} resources crucial for survival and reproduction is ubiquitous across the animal kingdom. However, most {{research has focused on}} male-male competition over access to mates. Female-female competition (hereon "female competition") over resources vital for reproduction, such as food to provision offspring, nesting sites, or social dominance, has been largely neglected. In this thesis, I aim to contribute to the growing body of literature examining female competition by investigating female competition over food in two species of fly. start by assessing the role of an exaggerated secondary sexual trait (eyespan) as a signal in female competition in the stalk-eyed fly Teleopsis dalmanni. Sexual selection theory argues that females only possess exaggerated traits as a result of correlation with males and that they play no functional role. I find that eyespan is an honest indicator of condition but does not appear to function as a signal in either male or female intrasexual encounters, as previously argued. Next, I consider the effects of mating on female aggression in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster. I find that <b>mating</b> <b>doubles</b> the amount of time females spend fighting over food. The ability to produce eggs is not required for this effect, but the receipt of sperm is essential. I also find that the magnitude of the effects of mating is determined by a femaleâs developmental environment â mating significantly increases a femaleâs chance of winning if she is raised at high larval density, but has no effect on her chances of winning if she is raised at low larval density. Finally, I find suggestions that variation in males and their ejaculates could alter levels of post-mating female aggression, suggesting that post-mating female aggression could potentially be under sexual conflict. </p...|$|R
40|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{is an important}} factor that drives evolution, in which fitness is increased, not by increasing survival or viability, but by acquiring more or better mates. Sexual selection favours traits that increase the ability of an individual to obtain more matings than other individuals that it is in competition with. For many sexually reproducing organisms, obtaining mates {{is an essential part of}} the lifecycle, sexual selection can therefore be very strong. A trait that leads to more matings can be selected, even if it strongly reduces other components of fitness, for instance predator escape. Often sexual selection leads to sex specific traits, which can become very extravagant. In animals and plants, it has been well established that this form of {{selection is}} an important evolutionary force, but it has not been considered for fungi. This thesis revolves around the idea that in this aspect, fungi are not fundamentally different from animals and plants and that also for species from this kingdom sexual selection influences evolution. Many fungi reproduce sexually and need to find a partner before reproduction can proceed. Furthermore, it is likely that not all individuals that benefit from mating can perform mating, hence a struggle for mate acquisition will occur. In my research I have investigated how likely it is that in fungi such struggles occur and which mechanisms might act during competitions. For these studies I used the mushroom forming basidiomycete fungus Schizophyllum commune as a model organism. I studied the potential for mate competition in natural populations, performed laboratory mating essays to test competition and preference, and experimentally tested if sexual selection can increase competitive ability. Sexual reproduction in fungi is highly regulated. Many molecular mechanisms are known that modulate each step, from meiosis to gamete production and from mate finding to gamete fusion. In most fungi these characteristics are regulated by genes located on the mating type locus or loci. These genes do not only regulate mating, but also define compatibility between the gametes: gametes with the same alleles at a mating type locus cannot fuse. Because of this <b>double</b> function, fungal <b>mating</b> types are potentially very important for sexual selection. Besides that mating types are a target for sexual selection because they affect traits that might increase competitive ability, since the mating types determine compatibility, they also define who competes with whom. Sexual selection describes how within one sex mating occurs for individuals of the other sex and is therefore always intra-sexual. Fungi do not have different sexes, but do have sex roles. Sexual selection will therefore act if there is competition for mating in the male or female role. Compatibility between sex roles is different from compatibility between mating types. The first is defined by the size of the mycelium, and the second by a genetic recognition mechanism. This difference is of importance to understand how sexual selection can act in fungi and is explained in Chapter 2. Mating in mushroom fungi occurs by reciprocal exchange of nuclei. In the female role nuclei from a compatible mate are incorporated into the haploid mycelium. These nuclei migrate though the mycelium until in each cell of the mycelium two haploid nuclei are present; it becomes a so called dikaryon. Only a dikaryon can produce mushrooms that produce spores. In the male role, a mycelium can donate nuclei to a haploid mycelium. A mycelium can thus be considered hermaphroditic. After fertilize, the dikaryon can still act as a nucleus donor, but not incorporate more nuclei – this type of mating is known as the Buller phenomenon. Also spores can act as male, but as they have no mycelium, not as a female. Due to the presence of more individuals that can mate in the male role than there are female mycelia (monokaryons), competition over fertilizations is expected. Competition can only occur when there are multiple individuals. Fungi are sessile organisms that can only meet other individuals when they are in the same locality. To test whether there is potential for sexual selection in nature, the number of individuals that meet each other needs to be defined. Not much knowledge on numbers of individuals is known, because mushroom fungi generally grow by mycelium expansion inside a substratum and each part of the mycelium can produce mushrooms. Therefore, all mushrooms on a tree can be one genetic individual, but it is also possible that each mushroom is a separate individual. We sampled 24, 12 and 24 mushrooms from the same substrate of three natural populations to analyse how mating occurred (Chapter 3). We determined the identity of the two different nuclei in each mushroom, as well as the mitochondria. Because mitochondria do not migrate during mating, they are specific for each female mycelium. We found that multiple genetic individuals (3, 3 and 8) are present in a small area, and that many matings must have occurred. Even though it is generally assumed that matings occur between two monokaryons, none such matings were found. The data suggest that mating in nature occurs between a monokaryon and a spore, or a monokaryon and a dikaryon. During a dikaryon-monokaryon (di-mon) mating only one of the two nucleus types from the dikaryon is successful in fertilizing the monokaryon. The nucleus type that is successful will likely increase its fitness considerably, as the entire female mycelium becomes colonized. Sexual selection is expected to select for nuclei that are better in performing this fertilization. Furthermore, during mating the receiving monokaryon meets two different nuclei, and might be able to choose between them. We performed crosses between 15 dikaryons and six different monokaryons to test if selection occurs, and whether selection occurs by male-male competition, or by female choice (Chapter 4). When confronting the same dikaryon with different monokaryon, in some of the cases the female mycelium decided which of the two nuclei won. In most cases however, the same nucleus always fertilized the monokaryon, irrespective of which monokaryon. This suggests that nuclei are able to either manipulate the monokaryon in incorporating them into the mycelium and not the other type, or that the nuclei of one type can directly suppress mating by the other nuclei in the dikaryon. Nuclei in a dikaryon have a strict way of cell division in which the different types divide in synchrony. Probably the two nuclei keep each other in check to assure this synchrony. Experiments in which the two nuclei in a dikaryon are separated into monokaryons suggest that the two nuclei suppress each other’s mitotic division, and that one of the two nuclei is better in suppression than the other. Consequently, after de-dikaryotisation more monokaryons of one type are recovered than of the other. We tested if this mechanism of suppression might be responsible for the dominant nuclei in the di-mon matings (Chapter 5). Separating the two nuclei confirmed earlier findings that always one of the two nuclei is dominant and that a hierarchy in dominance exists. This pecking order did not correspond with the results from the winner in the di-mon matings, which suggests that the mechanism of suppressed mitotic division is not responsible for dominance in di-mon matings. Nevertheless, we argue that the hypothesis that a link between the two mechanisms exists should not be completely written off. Because the interactions that take place during di-mon matings are very complex, the functioning of this mechanism might be obscured during mating. The observed variance in mating success described above might lead to sexual selection, however, it does not show that sexual selection actually led to traits that improve increased mate acquisition. To show that traits can evolve that increase fitness by higher mating success, we performed an evolution experiment (Chapter 6). An evolving population of nuclei was continuously mated with a non-evolving monokaryon. This setup selected for novel traits that increase competitive ability over matings. After 20 transfers, four out of twelve evolved lines had increased in competitive fitness and one line had decreased. Different fitness components were measured to investigate which traits had resulted in changed fitness. Fertilization success was mainly determined at the moment of fusion with and in initial migration into the receiving monokaryon. Two strains showed increased spores production, but this did not add to the increased fitness caused by fusion and initial migration. Little fitness change occurred during migration or in the dikaryon phase. We observed no clear trade-offs between the competitive ability of fertilizing in the male role, and female characteristics. This experiment showed that sexual selection can act in mushroom fungi. Sexual selection can also play a role in other groups of fungi than the mushroom forming fungi. So far this has not been considered, and little research has been done to show how mate competition might influence evolution. We reinterpreted the current knowledge on mating in fungi and assessed whether and when sexual selection might play a role (Chapter 7). Sexual selection is most likely to occur when sex roles can be observed during mating, as this can lead to skewed sex ratios. Also when there is large difference in quality between potential mates sexual selection might lead to evolution of choice. Directions are given where sexual selection is expected to function in fungal mating. Examples are given of how sexual selection might have led to for instance the evolution of micro-conidia in ascomycetes and pheromone redundancy in basidiomycetes. Furthermore, the existence of different sex roles in fungi, can lead to sexual conflict between the genomes derived from the paternal and the maternal gametes of which examples are given. The realization that sexual selection can also act in fungi gives great opportunity to test how universal general theories of sexual selection are in another important group of organisms. Additionally, because fungi are easy to manipulate, predictions on sexual selection can be tested experimentally using fungi. Mushroom forming fungi have a life history which differs from animals and plants. Sexual selection will therefore affect mushroom fungi in a different manner than it would animals and plants. In the general discussion of this thesis (Chapter 8) I will assess how mating influences fungal fitness, teasing apart the benefits and costs of mating in the male and female roles. I give directions for future research and discuss a setup to directly measure the effect of pheromones on female choice in mushroom fungi. There are still many unanswered fundamental questions about sexual selection. Adding knowledge from a third important kingdom can help increase the understanding of the principles that drive evolution by sexual selection. Furthermore, applying sexual selection theory to fungi might elucidate the functioning of the sometimes very complex mechanisms that have evolved for fungal mating.  ...|$|R
