5|$|Braham was not {{satisfied}} with his current score-rate and lack of action in September 1943. Consequently, he flew a number of missions against ground targets. Successful night fighter pilots were ordered {{not to engage in}} such activities that exposed them to excessive risk. On one particular mission he decided to hunt enemy rail transport after failing to find enemy aircraft. On the Dieppe to Paris line he intercepted a locomotive which exploded after being hit. He attacked another but struck some trees which damaged the underside of the fuselage. Braham maintained control and flew home. It was not unusual for him to return with strange defections caused by collisions with objects. After one sortie against shipping the armourers were <b>drenched</b> <b>in</b> salt water and seaweed when they opened the panel housing the cannons with the intention of replacing spent ammunition.|$|E
5|$|In her dream, Trijata sees Rama and {{his brother}} Lakshmana riding the {{celestial}} elephant Airavata toward Sita. Rama takes Sita in his lap and rises high in the sky, allowing Sita to touch the Sun and the Moon. Then the trio ride to Lanka {{and get into the}} Pushpaka Vimana (aerial chariot of Ravana) to fly towards the north, while Ravana, <b>drenched</b> <b>in</b> oil and with a red complexion, lies on the ground. Ravana then heads south on a donkey and falls in a pit of dung. A black woman in a red saree, drags him to the south. Other members of Ravana's family, like his brother Kumbhakarna and son Indrajit, face similar fates. Ravana's brother Vibishana is seen in regal white garments, riding a four tusked elephant near the Pushpaka Vimana. The city of Lanka drowns in the ocean and a monkey (vanara) messenger of Rama burns the city. Trijata advises the rakshasis to take refuge in Sita and apologize to her; in turn, Sita promises that if Trijata's dream materializes, she will protect her rakshasi guards.|$|E
5|$|To give a {{sense of}} the dry and dusty {{environment}} of the Dust Bowl, smoke and dirt were constantly blown through tubes onto the set. The actors' clothes were ragged and <b>drenched</b> <b>in</b> dirt, and Carnivàle had approximately 5,000 people costumed in the show's first season alone. The creative team listened to 1930s' music and radio and read old Hollywood magazines to get the period's sound, language, and slang right. The art department had an extensive research library of old catalogs, among them an original 1934 Sears Catalog, which were purchased at flea markets and antique stores. The East European background of some characters and Asian themes in Brother Justin's story were incorporated into the show. Aside from the show's supernatural elements, a historical consultant deemed Carnivàle historic accuracy to be excellent regarding the characters' lives and clothes, their food and accommodations, their cars and all the material culture.|$|E

5|$|A month later, Jennifer is {{beginning}} to look pale, so she accepts a date with school goth/emo Colin, whom she brutally kills. While Needy and Chip have sex, Needy senses something dreadful has happened. She leaves in a panic and almost runs over Jennifer, who is <b>drenched</b> <b>in</b> blood. At home, she finds Jennifer in her bedroom. Jennifer kisses her, initiating a brief makeout session, and soon explains what happened after the fire: Low Shoulder took her {{into the woods and}} offered her as a virgin sacrifice to Satan in exchange for fame and fortune. Although the sacrifice and demonic exchange were a success, Jennifer was not a virgin. As a result, when lead singer Nikolai murdered her, the ritual backfired and a demonic spirit took over her body. Unbeknownst to Needy, Jennifer also encountered Indian exchange student Ahmet after the fire and, upon hearing that no one knew he had survived, took him into the woods and made him her first victim. Jennifer states that when she has eaten, she can withstand virtually any injury without pain, making her rather difficult to kill.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of his actions at Broodseinde, McGee was awarded the Victoria Cross, one of two Australians to be so {{decorated}} that day. However, he never saw the announcement of the award. On 12 October 1917—eight days after McGee's Victoria Cross action—the 40th Battalion returned to the frontline, in an attempt to exploit the success of the previous week. The battlefield was <b>drenched</b> <b>in</b> rain, turning the ground into a quagmire that was additionally dominated by several German pillboxes. McGee—who had been appointed acting company sergeant major of B Company that morning—led his unit into the attack. As the men of the company advanced forward, a machine gun began firing upon them from the front, before a second opened up on their flank. Men ran to take cover in shellholes as the German fire inflicted several casualties. McGee, however, made a rush towards the guns in an apparent effort to silence them. As he ran towards the pillbox, a bullet struck him in the head, killing him instantly. McGee was later buried in Tyne Cot Cemetery; he was one of 248 members of the 40th Battalion killed or wounded during the Battle of Passchendaele. McGee's fellow Australian Victoria Cross recipient from Broodseinde, Lance Corporal Walter Peeler, was also severely wounded on this day, receiving a bullet wound to his arm.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{red palm}} weevil,Rhynchophorus ferrugineus (Olivier), is a {{phytophagous}} insect that feeds on soft succulent tissues of most palm species {{and is considered}} the main palm pest in the Middle East and the Mediterranean Basin. The {{aim of this study}} was to test the efﬁcacy of imidacloprid oil dispersion (OD) as a <b>drench</b> <b>in</b> preventive and curative treatments against R. ferrugineus inPhoenix canariensis, Washingtonia robusta, Washingtonia ﬁliferaandTrachycarpus fortunei. RESULTS: Levels of infestation were highest in P. canariensis. There was no infestation in W. ﬁlifera. Mean efﬁcacies of 100 and 94 % were obtained in preventive and curative treatments respectively. High efﬁcacies in preventive treatments (mean 95. 4 %) lasted for up to 45 days after application. CONCLUSION: The high efﬁcacies and persistence of imidacloprid OD applied as a <b>drench</b> <b>in</b> young palms show the potential of this product for the management ofR. ferrugineu...|$|R

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{prevalence of}} anthelmintic (<b>drench)</b> resistance <b>in</b> gastrointestinal parasite populations is decreasing {{the profitability of}} the sheep industry in Western Australia (WA). A strategy, referred to as refugia management, {{has the potential to}} delay the development of resistant parasites by not exposing a proportion of the worm population to chemical control. A dynamic bioeconomic model is used to assess the economic value of refugia for management of the worm species Teladorsagia circumcincta and Macrocyclic Lactone <b>drenches</b> <b>in</b> Western Australian sheep flocks. A low rate of refugia (2 per cent) is most profitable under standard circumstances because it slows the development of resistance, but also reduces the cost accruing to production losses that arise from maintaining a proportion of the worm population in refugia. The optimal drenching strategy is to <b>drench</b> heavily early <b>in</b> the time horizon to minimise worm populations in subsequent years.

40|$|Petri {{disease is}} a {{vascular}} disease associated with decline and dieback of young grapevines. A major means of spread of the causal organisms, Phaeomoniella chlamydospora and Phaeoacremonium spp., is via infected propagation material. Since no curative control measures are known, proactive measures must be taken in grapevine nurseries to manage this disease. To study this aspect, semicommercial trials with naturally infected rootstock material were performed in grapevine nurseries in South Africa. Prior to grafting, rootstocks were treated as follows: 1 -h <b>drench</b> <b>in</b> suspensions of benomyl, phosphoric acid, different bacterial and Trichoderma formulations, water, or hot water treated (HWT; 30 min at 50 °C). Grafted cuttings were planted and grown in a greenhouse and two commercial field nurseries and uprooted 8 months later. In instances where rootstocks were treated with benomyl or Trichoderma formulations, the incidences of Phaeomoniella and Phaeoacremonium in grafted cuttings and uprooted nursery vines were significantly {{lower than that of}} the water treatment. However, the reduction was most consistent and noteworthy in vines on rootstocks that received HWT prior to grafting. HWT of dormant nursery vines effected a similar reduction in Phaeomoniella and Phaeoacremonium incidence. Root-stock <b>drenches</b> <b>in</b> benomyl and/or Trichoderma formulations could thus be integrated with HWT for the proactive management of Petri disease in grapevine nurseries. Articl...|$|R

25|$|One {{consequence}} of these positions that Unger points {{to is the}} revision of the concept and function of mathematics. If {{there is only one}} world <b>drenched</b> <b>in</b> time through and through, then mathematics cannot be a timeless expression of multiple universes that captures reality. Rather, Unger argues that mathematics is a means of analyzing the world removed of time and phenomenal distinction. By emptying the world of time and space it is able to better focus on one aspect of reality: the recurrence of certain ways in which pieces of the world relate to other pieces. Its subject matter are the structured wholes and bundles of relations, which we see outside mathematics only as embodied in the time-bound particulars of the manifest world. In this way, mathematics extends our problem solving powers as an extension of human insight, {{but it is not a}} part of the world.|$|E

25|$|The celebration {{has been}} {{traced back to}} the 14th century but may have earlier, pre-Christian origins {{involving}} the celebration of the March equinox; The origins of the word dyngus are obscure; it may come from the German Dingeier ("the eggs that are owed") or Dingnis ("ransom"). The occurrence of the celebration across the western Slav countries (plus Hungary, whose inhabitants' forebears conquered a region that was inhabited by Slavs) suggests a common origin in pagan mythology, most likely a link with the Slavic goddesses of fertility. It may possibly be related to the tradition of watering the Corn Mother, who made crops grow and was represented {{in the form of a}} doll or wreath made from corn. This would be symbolically <b>drenched</b> <b>in</b> water and kept over the winter until its grain was mixed with the seed corn in the spring to ensure a successful harvest.
