5|$|Burnham was {{trekking}} the 1,000 miles (1,609km) {{north from}} Durban to Matabeleland {{with his wife}} and son, an American buckboard and six donkeys when war broke out between Rhodes's British South Africa Company and the Matabele (or Ndebele) King Lobengula in late 1893. He signed up to scout for the Company immediately on reaching Matabeleland, and joined the fighting. Leander Starr Jameson, the Company's Chief Magistrate in Mashonaland, hoped to defeat the Matabele quickly by capturing Lobengula at his royal town of Bulawayo, and so sent Burnham and a small group of scouts ahead to report on the situation there. While {{on the outskirts of town}} they watched as the Matabele burned down and destroyed <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>sight.</b> By the time the Company troops had arrived in force, Lobengula and his warriors had fled and there was little left of old Bulawayo. The Company then moved into the remains of Bulawayo, established a base, and sent out patrols to find Lobengula. The most famous of these patrols was the Shangani Patrol, led by Major Allan Wilson and the man he chose as his Chief of Scouts, Fred Burnham.|$|E

As the French cavalry advance guard approached Crema in a cloud of dust, the observer made out the leading horseman yelling at the Austrian stragglers whom he encountered on the road.

(Harvey reports the date as 28 March but the Konbaung Hset Chronicle gives Tuesday, 5th waxing of Tabaung 1125 ME, which is 7 April.) The attackers finally breached the walls by sunset, and entered the city. The Siamese fought on inside the city but were eventually overwhelmed.

25|$|A major {{strategy}} of the army {{was the use of}} scorched earth tactics, mainly in times of retreat but also in times of advance. They would burn and destroy <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>sight</b> that could be of use to the enemy, crops and infrastructure (wells, bridges, etc.). At times, the entire region at the border was destroyed and depopulated to create a buffer zone. For example, in 1527, King Mingyi Nyo depopulated and destroyed the infrastructure of the entire Kyaukse–Taungdwingyi corridor between Ava (Inwa) and his capital Toungoo (Taungoo). Likewise, the Burmese had left the entire Chiang Mai region depopulated and its infrastructure destroyed in the wake of their 1775–1776 war with Siam.|$|E

One day, fifty years after Beowulf's battle with Grendel's mother, a slave steals a golden cup from the lair of a dragon at Earnanæs. When the dragon sees that the cup has been stolen, it leaves its cave in a rage, burning <b>everything</b> <b>in</b> <b>sight.</b> Beowulf and his warriors come to fight the dragon, but Beowulf tells his men that he will fight the dragon alone {{and that they should}} wait on the barrow. Beowulf descends to do battle with the dragon, but finds himself outmatched. His men, upon seeing this and fearing for their lives, retreat into the woods. One of his men, Wiglaf, however, in great distress at Beowulf's plight, comes to his aid. The two slay the dragon, but Beowulf is mortally wounded. After Beowulf dies, Wiglaf remains by his side, grief-stricken. When the rest of the men finally return, Wiglaf bitterly admonishes them, blaming their cowardice for Beowulf's death. Afterward, Beowulf is ritually burned on a great pyre in Geatland while his people wail and mourn him, fearing that without him, the Geats are defenceless against attacks from surrounding tribes. Afterwards, a barrow, visible from the sea, is built in his memory. (Beowulf lines 2712–3182).|$|E

5000|$|An {{emaciated}} canary, singing like Frank Sinatra and {{attracting the}} attention of all the admiring chicks, is getting on the nerves of a pipe-puffing parrot, who speaks like Bing Crosby. The parrot spots a cat, foraging through the trash. Telling the cat he needs more vitamins (which the canary has been swallowing in bulk), he lures the cat inside to snare the canary. The straightforward approach fails (the canary bops him in the left eye turning it violet). He, by the parrot's urging carves a female canary from soap and lures Frankie there; the birds slide down a greased counter, into the sink, and down the drain, but only the soap bird goes through the pipe and down the cat's throat. A trail of birdseed into the garage seems to work, but Frankie jacks the cat's mouth open. The cat laces the vitamins with buckshot, but the magnet attracts <b>everything</b> metal <b>in</b> <b>sight</b> except his prey. The canary turns the cat's vacuum cleaner against him, with a crash in the fireplace giving the cat a hot-stomach; as he buries {{his head in the}} sink, the bird adds Foamo-Seltzer to the water; the cat rockets off, crashing into a wall.|$|R

Boo even killed four of the five Kaiō-shin, who govern the universe, however, Boo was too ferocious even for Bibbidi to control, so he sealed Boo temporarily and moved him to their next target, Earth.

In present-day, Bibbidi's son Bobbidi makes it his goal to revive Boo, which Kaiō-shin plans to prevent by killing him.

Feeling guilty for how they treated him, the Griffins give Brian their blessings.|$|E
