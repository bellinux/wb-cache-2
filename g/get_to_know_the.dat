5|$|As a {{preparation}} for the World Championships in Tuscany Van Dijk went during the season {{a few times to}} Italy to practise the time trial course. She trained at five in the morning to avoid traffic and made video recordings of the course to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> turns. In the week before the World Championships she won the French time trial Chrono Champenois – Trophée Européen. All the preparations paid off and the World Championships were very successful for Van Dijk. With her team she won for the second consecutive year the world title in the team time trial. Because Van Dijk had won almost all the time trials this year she was also the main favourite for the individual time trial. Despite the pressure she won the time trial with a convincing victory and became the second Dutch women to win this title. At the end of the championships, Van Dijk finished 16th on a non-preferable hilly road race course.|$|E
5|$|As during Napoleon's Egyptian Campaign, when a Commission of Sciences and Arts had {{accompanied}} the military campaign, a Morea scientific expedition (Expédition scientifique de Morée.) accompanied the troops. Seventeen learned men representing different specialties (natural history and antiquities – archaeology, architecture and sculpture) made the voyage. Their work was of major importance in increasing {{knowledge about the}} country. As an example, the topographic maps they produced were excellent. More significantly, the measurements, drawings, profiles, plans and proposals for the theoretical restoration of Peloponnesian monuments, of Attica and of the Cyclades were, following James Stuart and Nicholas Revett's Antiquities of Athens, a new attempt to systematically and exhaustively catalogue ancient Greek ruins. The Morea expedition and its publications offered a near-complete description of the regions visited. They formed a scientific, aesthetic and human inventory that remained {{one of the best}} means, short of visiting them in person, to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> regions.|$|E

500|$|The {{series was}} pitched to ABC Entertainment, {{who gave the}} green light, and the show was picked up as a mid-season {{replacement}} for Boston Legal in the 2005 television season. Francie Calfo, {{executive vice president of}} development at ABC Entertainment, commented that ABC was looking for a medical show that was unlike the others airing at the time. She pointed out that [...] "edical shows are hard, and it was hard {{trying to figure out where}} ours could be different.

500|$|... "Not to everyone's taste, granted, [...] is {{nevertheless}} an original and disturbing take on modern love stories" [...] was {{the view of}} Stuart Willis writing for the Sex-Gore-Mutants website. Believing that the film was a [...] "pleasant surprise", he praised the improvised nature of the work, believing that it created believable scenes and allowed the viewer to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> characters [...] "almost without realising." [...] He considered the acting to be very good, and particularly praised Hoyle's ability to portray a paedophile grooming {{a young man in}} a way that was both [...] "pathetic and truly sinister all at once". Rather than falling into [...] "tasteless exploitation", Willis thought that the film was saved by a lack of sensationalism. Praising the exterior scenes as [...] "beautifully atmospheric" [...] and the music as [...] "fitting the laconic mood and sense of ill-foreboding well", he considered the film to be a good example of low-key filmmaking, akin to that produced in Britain during the early 1980s.|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall, on {{his blog}} What's Alan Watching, was mixed towards [...] "Of Vice and Men", writing that the episode's {{focus on the}} mystery of the week did not work thematically, as Veronica did not have a stake in its solving. [...] "The better we <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> {{supporting}} characters and the closer each arc gets to its conclusion, the harder it gets to care about stories that don't have a really personal connection for Veronica." [...] Rowan Kaiser, writing for The A.V. Club, was very critical of the episode, naming five ways in which he thought Veronica was unlikable in the episode. [...] "Simply put, Veronica spends most of [...] "Of Vice and Men" [...] acting like she's better and smarter than everyone else. Of course, she is smarter than everyone, so that's okay. But better? Sometimes that's justified, sometimes it's not," [...] elaborating that Veronica became increasingly unlikeable in the episode. He was also negative towards the final sequence, writing [...] "it feels slightly manipulative," [...] commenting that the show was not ready to tackle scenes of attempted rape.|$|E
500|$|Madonna's initial work on {{the album}} had started with Shep Pettibone, who {{produced}} her fifth studio album, Erotica (1992). However, she found {{out that they were}} doing the same vein of music from the previous album, which did not please her. At the time, Madonna was a fan of Babyface's song [...] "When Can I See You" [...] (1994), and became interested in working with him, as she wanted [...] "lush ballads" [...] for her record. They would collaborate on three songs for the album in his studio in Beverly Hills, with [...] "Forbidden Love" [...] and [...] "Take a Bow" [...] ending up on the album. Recalling the latter's development, the producer commented, [...] "I wasn't so much thinking about the charts. I think I was more in awe of the fact that I was working with Madonna. It was initially surreal, but then you <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> person a little bit, and you calm down and then it's just work. And work is fun". He also said that for [...] "Forbidden Love", [...] "She heard the basic track and it all started coming out, melodies and everything... It was a much easier process than I thought it would be".|$|E
500|$|The British Society for Parasitology {{was founded}} in the 1950s, largely due to Bishop's efforts. She was {{initially}} given only five pounds and a secretary to start the Society; to raise funds Bishop passed around a pudding basin at the Society's meetings. The society was originally a subgroup of the Institute of Biology at Cambridge, but it became an independent group in 1960 and was headed by Bishop. She {{was the president of}} the group, called the Institute of Biology Parasitology Group, from 1960 to 1962, the third overall leader of the group. Later that decade, the Department of Biology asked her to be the department head, but she declined because of the public nature of the role. For 20 years, the scientific journal Parasitology had Bishop on staff as an editor. Her lifelong association with Girton College prompted the placement of a plaque commemorating her life, whose inscription, quoted from Virgil, reads [...] "Felix, qui potuit rerum cognoscere causas", Latin for [...] "Happy is the one who has been able to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> causes of things". In 1992, the British Society for Parasitology created a grant in Bishop's name, the Ann Bishop Travelling Award, to aid young parasitologists in travelling for field work where their parasites of interest are endemic.|$|E

500|$|The {{show was}} {{announced}} in late 2004 as a mid-season replacement for Boston Legal. It was originally scheduled {{to run in the}} Boston Legal time slot for just four weeks, but after receiving high ratings remained in the time slot {{for the remainder of the}} season. ABC Entertainment President Steve McPherson commented on the scheduling decision: [...] "Ultimately we decided that, without having adequate lead time or marketing dollars to devote to moving either show so late in the season, we'd continue to let 'Grey's' build on its tremendous momentum through May." [...] Prior to broadcast, it was announced that the show's title would change from Grey's Anatomy to Complications, although ultimately this did not come to pass. Francie Calfo, executive vice president for development at ABC Entertainment, commented on the show's conception: [...] "I think there was a need for this kind of show on our air, specifically a medical show. And Shonda found a twist on it that made it perfect for where we're at right now. Medical shows are hard, and it was hard trying to figure out where ours could be different. But where everybody else is speeding up their medical shows, she found a way to slow it down, so you <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> characters. There's definitely a strong female appeal to it." [...] Rhimes explained that she had found the idea of a show about smart women competing against one another an interesting one.|$|E
500|$|Episode 2 [...] Part Two: A sycophantic clergyman named Mr. William Collins visits his cousins, the Bennets. He is the entailed heir {{of their}} home and estate, Longbourn, and intends to marry one of Mr. Bennet's daughters. This is meant, on his part, {{as an act of}} benign {{goodwill}} towards the Bennets, because Mrs. Bennet and her unwed daughters will be rendered homeless once Mr. Bennet dies and Mr. Collins inherits the estate. He therefore invites himself for a two-week visit, to <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> Bennets better and select a wife from among the daughters of the family. However, the Bennet girls judge Mr. Collins to be a rather ridiculous man, an [...] "oddity" [...] with many peculiarities of speech and deportment. They are nevertheless civil to him, and take him to balls and social events in Meryton. One day, while on a walk around Meryton village, they meet members of a newly arrived militia, including a Mr George Wickham. At a social event, Wickham befriends Elizabeth and tells her that Darcy, who is the son of Wickham's late father's employer, has denied Wickham a living (a curacy) which had been assured to him by Mr. Darcy's father. At another social event, Darcy surprises Elizabeth with a dance offer at a ball at Netherfield, which she grudgingly but politely accepts. Mr Collins proposes to Elizabeth the next day, but she resoundingly rejects him. While Mrs Bennet disagrees about Elizabeth's decision, her close friend Charlotte Lucas invites Mr Collins to stay at Lucas Lodge.|$|E
500|$|Conceiving {{the initial}} script for Carnivàle between 1990 and 1992, Daniel Knauff set its plot in a {{carnival}} {{environment in the}} 1930s Dust Bowl, which he felt had not been dramatized as a series yet. He {{had grown up with}} a disabled father who was not commonly accepted as a normal human being. Freaks of the 1930s, however, who might not have found another place offering a future than a carnival, tended to be celebrities in the period. Daniel Knauf expanded the plot with a complex fictional universe based on a good versus evil theme, led by carnival healer Ben Hawkins and Brother Justin Crowe, a California preacher. In his story pitch to HBO, Knauf presented Carnivàle as a collection of media samples {{from the perspective of a}} fictional author trying to uncover Ben's mysterious story. These fictional samples consisted of interviews, diary entries, and various newspaper clippings, photos and book references forming the character biographies of all major Carnivàle characters. The character backgrounds were further developed before the filming of Carnivàle began, but were not made part of the show's visible structure. The audience would therefore only <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> <b>the</b> characters as a natural aspect in the story. The characters themselves are confronted with [...] "self-realization and becoming aware of these [...] powers and learning to harness them, and the implications of this battle between good and evil." [...] Seventeen actors received star billing in the first season; fifteen of whom were part of the carnival storyline. The second season amounted to thirteen main cast members, supplemented by several actors in recurring roles. Although such large casts make shows more expensive to produce, the writers have more flexibility in story decisions.|$|E
