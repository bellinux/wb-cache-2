Similarly, a study in Eastern India assessed the impact of chronic exposure to <b>indoor</b> biomass <b>smoke</b> on respiratory health in 681 non-smoking women and 438 age matched women not exposed to biomass smoke [23]. Compared to LPG users, biomass users had a higher prevalence of cough, mucus production and wheeze (71.8 % versus 30.8 %, p[*]=[*] 0.001), and dyspnoea (58.4 % versus 19.9 %, p[*]=[*] 0.001) [23].|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} whether the location of hospitality venues considering; rurality, presence of local ordinances, and socioeconomic status, influenced the quantity of tobacco smoke pollution in a predominantly rural state. The study built on current scientific literature in four aspects. First, it was the first U. S. statewide study on tobacco smoke pollution levels in hospitality venues. Second, it quantified <b>indoor</b> tobacco <b>smoke</b> pollution specifically in rural areas. Third, it used random sampling, a method rarely used in studying <b>indoor</b> tobacco <b>smoke</b> pollution. Fourth, it analyzed tobacco smoke exposure as a function of socioeconomic status. A stratified random sample of 136 restaurant and bars were assessed, using a modification Roswell Cancer Park Institute’s method, for the indoor air quality indicator of particulate matter that was 2. 5 μm aerodynamic diameter or smaller (PM 2. 5). A unique partial mediation model found 69. 1 % of smoke-free policy’s impact on tobacco smoke pollution was mediated by observed smoking and 30. 9 % was the direct impact of policy on tobacco smoke pollution levels. A significant association (Welch’s F(2, 43. 63) = 9. 55, p <. 001) between rurality and tobacco smoke pollution in bars was also observed. A significant association (R 2 = 0. 51, F(3, 131) = 70. 47, p <. 001) between local smoke-free laws and tobacco smoke pollution depended upon the venue type. Compliance was significantly lower in venues in communities without local ordinances (Fisher’s Exact Test, p<. 01, 2 -tailed) and in co-located venues (Fisher’s Exact Test, p<. 01, 2 -tailed). 	In conclusion, smoke-free laws had an indirect and direct impact on tobacco smoke pollution. As rurality increased tobacco smoke pollution in bars significantly increased. The impact of local ordinances on tobacco smoke pollution levels depended on the venue type. Compliance with laws increased significantly in communities with a local ordinance and decreased significantly in co-located venues. Continued recognition of the disparities in exposure to tobacco smoke pollution in rural areas is needed. Future studies should determine if the mediation model can be replicated. Additional studies of tobacco smoke exposure and policy impact in rural areas are needed. Further research of poverty influences on tobacco smoke pollution levels in hospitality venues is recommended.

The findings of interest included hilar and mediastinal lymph node enlargement that was intensely hypermetabolic on 18 F-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) and histopathological findings of anthracotic pigment accumulation in lymphoid tissue that led to a diagnosis of anthracotic pneumoconiosis. The authors state it is difficult to understand the cause of increased FDG uptake on PET since the patient did not have malignancy or active inflammatory disease. While specific mechanisms of increased FDG uptake in domestically acquired particulate lung disease have not been elucidated, increased FDG uptake in other pneumoconioses has been well established in previous reports. In a series of 6 patients with coal worker’s pneumoconiosis who had a total of 19 nodules greater than 1 cm in diameter, 18 of the nodules were hypermetabolic and none was malignant, consistent with a coal dust induced response. 2 Other authors have reported positive findings on PET imaging in the setting of silica induced lung disease, 3 including positive uptake in mediastinal lymph nodes consistent with silica induced inflammation. 4 These reports support the conclusion by Onitilo et al 1 that their patient’s history of life-long exposure to <b>indoor</b> wood <b>smoke</b> caused enlargement of mediastinal an...|$|R
