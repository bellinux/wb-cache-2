40|$|This study {{examined}} the effectiveness of <b>Introductory</b> <b>Flight</b> Screening (IFS) for U. S. Navy and Marine Corps student pilots. It compared a non-IFS group to an IFS-complete group to determine if IFS had any effect on Primary drop-on-request (DOR) and flight-failure (FF) attrition. It then examined the return on investment (ROI) of the IFS program utilizing T- 34 flying-hour costs, active-duty costs, and opportunity cost-savings of IFS-screened {{students who did not}} enter undergraduate pilot training. Results suggest that IFS did not {{have an effect on the}} DOR rate and may have produced the undesired effect of delaying the DOR-student's decision until later in the syllabus. IFS had a desirable effect on the FF attrition rate with no significant change in T- 34 flight hours per FF. The combined Primary DOR and FF rate, although significantly lower, did not achieve expectations. The ROI analysis was completed with both composite-pay costs and Individual Account costs. In both cases, the IFS-investment costs significantly outweighed the IFS savings resulting in a net loss and an undesirable ROI. Several alternatives were discussed as possible improvements to the current IFS program...|$|R
50|$|Ruth’s flying career {{started on}} September 9, 1929 at Ryan Field in San Diego, California with an <b>introductory</b> <b>flight.</b> Within {{a short period}} of time she became the 65th {{licensed}} woman pilot in the U.S. Less than 24 hours after attaining her license, Ruth took off from Lindbergh Field on November 18, 1929, in a Great Lakes biplane and continued climbing to what she believed was an altitude of better than 18,000 feet over the skies of San Diego. This was later recognized as a new official altitude record for women in light planes of 15,718 feet. On February 16, 1930, Ruth Alexander qualified for a United States second-class glider license from the slopes of Mount Soledad, near La Jolla, California. In doing so she followed Anne Morrow Lindbergh as the second woman in the United States to achieve this distinction. Ruth made a perfect flight using a primary glider lasting 2 minutes, 33 and 2/5 seconds. On July 4, 1930, Ruth Alexander flew her Barling NB-3 light aircraft (serial number 52, U.S. Department of Commerce registration number 880M) to 21,000 feet, however this was an unofficial record. In the spring of 1930, she became a glider instructor and, in so doing, became the first woman in the United States to hold this position.|$|R
50|$|The NTPS {{grew out}} of a {{successful}} series of <b>introductory</b> <b>flight</b> test courses taught for military test organizations in the United States and Canada. Using an instrumented De Havilland Dove (DH-104), introductory, two-week performance and flying qualities flight test courses were taught for Edwards AFB, California; Patuxent River NAS, Maryland; Eglin AFB, Florida; the Naval Postgraduate School, California; Wright-Patterson AFB, Ohio; and the Aerospace Engineering Test Establishment, CFB Cold Lake, Canada. The success of these courses led to opportunities to teach broader content flight test courses abroad. The school was formally established as a not-for-profit educational institute in the state of California in April 1981. The initial years of the school consisted of teaching introductory courses within the United States, mainly for military organizations, and teaching longer courses abroad (in Israel, Taiwan, Brazil and South Africa) using customer aircraft. By 1986, {{the decision was made to}} construct a large hangar and classroom complex in Mojave, California. Over the ensuing years more flight test training was done in Mojave with a growing fleet of aircraft, rather than at customer locations. Today the school trains 20-25 students in year-long courses with approximately 200 students attending one of several short courses each year.|$|R
40|$|Approved {{for public}} release, {{distribution}} unlimitedThis study examines {{the effect of}} Aviation Selection Test Battery (ASTB) waivers on Marine student-aviator attrition. The first objective {{was to determine whether}} Marine student-aviators who are granted an ASTB waiver are significantly more likely to attrite for performance or for motivation reasons. The second objective was to determine the effect on attrition of changing the Marine Corps' ASTB minimum score waiver policy to allow more than ten percent of aviators to enroll annually with a test-score waiver. The study uses logit models to estimate the effect of ASTB waivers on attrition and to simulate the effect of changing the Marine Corps' waiver policy. The results suggest that student-pilots with a waiver for an ASTB score of 4 / 5 are significantly more likely to attrite. Additionally, student-NFOs with a waiver, regardless of their test score, are significantly more likely to attrite. The simulation shows a small positive effect on attrition of increasing the Marine Corps' current waiver rate. This study recommends that the Marine Corps maintain its current policy and that further research be conducted to account for student-aviator attrition during <b>Introductory</b> <b>Flight</b> Screening and to determine the effect of changing the Marine Corps' waiver policy on recruiting costs, flight school training costs, and minority representation.
