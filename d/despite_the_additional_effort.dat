50|$|Two Scout {{helicopters}} {{were acquired}} by the Royal Australian Navy (RAN) in April 1963 and were operated by 723 Naval Air Squadron, with the aircraft being rotated aboard the hydrographic survey ship HMAS Moresby. The RAN Scouts proved the practicalities of operating helicopters from small ships for the RAN, and the RAN operated these helicopters up until 1973, when they were replaced by Bell 206B-1 Kiowas. The RAN experience with the Scouts aboard HMAS Moresby illustrated {{the need for a}} higher-level maintenance regime as a result of operating the helicopters in areas with high concentrations of abrasive coral sand encountered around the Australian coastline and the detrimental effect that it had on the rotor blades, airframe and engine components. <b>Despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>additional</b> <b>effort</b> to maintain the helicopters, the Scouts were considered to be superior to the seaplanes and flying boats that had previously been used in this role. One of the Scouts ditched in Wewak Harbour while taking off from HMAS Moresby in April 1967; although it was subsequently recovered, the aircraft was written off.|$|E
40|$|Temperature {{fluctuations}} {{can have}} a significant impact on the repeatability of spectral measurements and as a consequence can adversely affect the resulting calibration model. More specifically, when test samples measured at temperatures unseen in the training dataset are presented to the model, degraded predictive performance can materialise. Current methods for addressing the temperature variations in a calibration model can be categorised into two classes—calibration model based approaches, and spectra standardisation methodologies. This paper presents a comparative study on a number of strategies reported in the literature including partial least squares (PLS), continuous piecewise direct standardisation (CPDS) and loading space standardisation (LSS), in terms of the practical applicability of the algorithms, their implementation complexity, and their predictive performance. It was observed from the study that the global modelling approach, where latent variables are initially extracted from the spectra using PLS, and then augmented with temperature as the independent variable, achieved the best predictive performance. In addition, the two spectra standardisation methods, CPDS and LSS, did not provide consistently enhanced performance over the conventional global modelling approach, <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>additional</b> <b>effort</b> in terms of standardising the spectra across different temperatures. Considering the algorithmic complexity and resulting calibration accuracy, it is concluded that the global modelling (with temperature) approach should be first considered for the development of a calibration model where temperature variations are known to affect the fundamental data, prior to investigating the more powerful spectra standardisation approaches.

IP qualification provides IP providers and integrators with measurable quality characteristics that allow for high quality IP cores and to put buy decisions on a quantifiable basis. This paper presents unprecedented results that facilitate the comparison {{of the effectiveness of}} reusing qualified, digital soft IP to previous, immature reuse methods. An impressive reduction in IP integration effort, which is profitable for the IP customer, is demonstrated. Moreover, we show that the IP business can be profitable for <b>the</b> IP provider <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>additional</b> qualification <b>effort.</b> 1...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} {{methodology}} to efficiently implement the reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJ-MCMC) algorithms of Green, applicable for example to model selection inference in a Bayesian framework, which {{builds on the}} “dragging fast variables” ideas of Neal. We call such algorithms annealed importance sampling reversible jump (aisRJ). The proposed procedures {{can be thought of}} as being exact approximations of idealized RJ algorithms which in a model selection problem would sample the model labels only, but cannot be implemented. Central to the methodology is the idea of bridging different models with fictitious intermediate models, whose role is to introduce smooth intermodel transitions and, as we shall see, improve performance. Efficiency of the resulting algorithms is demonstrated on two standard model selection problems and we show that <b>despite</b> <b>the</b> <b>additional</b> computational <b>effort</b> incurred, <b>the</b> approach can be highly competitive computationally.

30|$|Let Δ e_i measure <b>the</b> <b>additional</b> <b>effort</b> or cost {{incurred}} by a steering institution and Δ e_j measure <b>the</b> <b>additional</b> <b>effort</b> or cost {{incurred by}} an actuator. Similarly, let Δ y measure {{a change in}} output. We can define a parameter θ =(Δ e_j)/(Δ e_i) that measures <b>the</b> <b>additional</b> <b>effort</b> incurred by actuators for a unit increase in signaling effort by the steering institutions and a parameter ϕ =Δ y/(Δ e_j) that measures <b>the</b> <b>additional</b> output resulting from a unit increase in effort by an actuator. Intuitively, θ describes {{the effectiveness of the}} steering institution (controller) in generating effort from the actuators, and ϕ captures the effectiveness of the actuators in converting effort to output. The overall effectiveness of the process is, then, μ =θϕ =Δ y/(Δ e_i), which summarizes the change in end output of the process arising from a unit change in signaling effort by the steering institutions. For any given reference variable w (and assuming no exogenous disturbance, d), a higher μ corresponds to a greater ability of the steering institutions to alter output so that it aligns with the desired outcome of w, and therefore corresponds to a stronger institution.|$|R
