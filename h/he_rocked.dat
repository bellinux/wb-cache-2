60|$|Gudrun seated herself behind him, and as <b>he</b> <b>rocked</b> back, {{she caught}} his hair between her finger and thumb, {{so that it}} tugged him as he swung forward again. He took no notice. There was only {{the sound of the}} rockers on the floor. In silence, like a crab, Gudrun caught a strand of his hair each time <b>he</b> <b>rocked</b> back. Ursula flushed, and sat in some pain. She saw the {{irritation}} gathering on his brow.|$|E
