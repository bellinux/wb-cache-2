The majority of Liverpool's ties were won by at least two goals, the exception was the semi-final against Tottenham Hotspur, which Liverpool won on the away goals rule.

Everton's James Dunn received treatment on a thigh injury in the ten days preceding the game, but was anticipated to be fit enough to play. Manchester City's main injury worry was Fred Tilson, who was troubled by a leg injury. Dunn was passed fit well before the game, allowing Everton to field the same line-up that played in <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> five previous cup ties.|$|E
5|$|Following the war's end, only 400 {{out of the}} library's nearly 3,000 volumes {{could be}} recovered, with only 200 of those books {{remaining}} on the library's shelves. Between 10 and 20 of the library's recovered volumes only contained three to <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> original books. The value of the recovered volumes was degraded, as many were damaged or broken. The society members that returned home to Romney were too war-weary to revive the society when they discovered {{the ruins of the}} Romney Classical Institute and its library, which had been an expensive endeavor to accumulate and took almost a half-century of labor to amass.

The deal vaulted the Avalanche, the former Nordiques, to the 1996 Stanley Cup. Roy won another title with the Avalanche in 2001 along with a third Conn Smythe Trophy before retiring in 2003 with more wins than any NHL goaltender. The Canadiens, meanwhile, fell into an extended stretch of mediocrity, missing the playoffs in <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> next ten seasons and failing to advance past {{the second round of}} the playoffs until 2010.

5|$|Fàbregas was {{selected}} {{as a part of}} del Bosque's 23-man squad for the 2010 FIFA World Cup.

He featured as a substitute in <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> seven matches, in which Spain lost their opening game before winning the next six en route to the final. In the Final itself, Fàbregas set up the extra-time winner for Iniesta to win Spain the World Cup {{for the first time in}} their history.|$|E

5|$|Having {{failed to}} make the playoffs the season before, and with their {{division}} rivals (the Chicago Cubs and Houston Astros) expected to be strong, the Cardinals were generally expected to finish 3rd in the National League Central. However, strong offensive seasons from Albert Pujols, Scott Rolen, and Jim Edmonds—during which they each hit more than 30home runs and 100runs batted in (RBI)—helped them to lead the league in runs scored. They also allowed the least runs of any team in the league. <b>Four</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> starters recorded at least 15 wins and closer Jason Isringhausen recorded a league-best47 saves. They added outfielder Larry Walker in August and finished the regular season with the best win–loss record in the league.|$|E

Despite uncertainty over whether the club would be able to continue as a business, Smith remained at the club. He started their first match of the 2010–11 season on 7 August 2010, a match in which Portsmouth were only able to name <b>four</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> permitted seven substitutes.|$|E
