5|$|Sardinia and Libya {{were already}} conquered by Marcellinus and Heraclius, when Basiliscus cast anchor off the Promontorium Mercurii, now Cap Bon, {{opposite}} Sicily, about forty miles from Carthage. Geiseric requested Basiliscus {{to allow him}} <b>five</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> draw up the conditions of a peace. During the negotiations, Geiseric gathered his ships and suddenly attacked the Roman fleet. The Vandals had filled many vessels with combustible materials. During the night, these fire ships were propelled against the unguarded and unsuspecting Roman fleet. The Roman commanders tried to rescue some ships from destruction, but these manoeuvres were blocked by the attack of other Vandal vessels.|$|E
5|$|The 500Hispanic {{settlers}} who {{had lived}} near Los Adaes had to resettle in San Antonio in 1773. In the six years between the inspection {{and the removal of}} the settlers, the immigrant population of East Texas had increased from 200 Europeans to 500, a mixture of Spanish, French, Indians, and a few blacks. The settlers were given only <b>five</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> prepare to relocate to San Antonio. Many of them perished during the three-month trek and others died soon after arriving.|$|E
5|$|The {{budget of}} about £1million per episode (totalling US$9.6million) allowed 20 {{shooting}} weeks of <b>five</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> film six 55-minute episodes. Production aimed for 10.5-hour shooting days plus time for costume and make-up. Two weeks before filming began, about 70 {{of the cast}} and crew gathered for the script read-through, followed by rehearsals, lessons for dancing, horse-riding, fencing, and other skills that needed to be ready ahead of the actual filming. Filming took place between June 1994 and 1 November 1994 to reflect the changing seasons in the plot, followed by post-production until mid-May 1995. Scenes in the same place were grouped in the filming schedule.|$|E

At Lane Stadium, Virginia Tech's home field, James Madison upset the heavily favored Hokies, 21–16. The loss was {{only the second time}} in college football history that a team ranked nationally was defeated by a team from the NCAA Football Championship Subdivision.

5|$|Beginning on August17, the NHC {{anticipated}} that a {{low pressure area}} would form within <b>five</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> {{the south of the}} Gulf of Tehuantepec in the East Pacific, with a 30% chance of tropical cyclogenesis. By the next day, the wave was located over Panama, and the NHC upgraded the potential for development to 60%. The wave crossed into the eastern Pacific with accompanying convection, developing a low pressure area on August19. Conditions were favorable for further development, and the thunderstorms increased and became better organized on August20. After an increase in rainbands and outflow around the well-defined center, the NHC classified the system as Tropical Depression Thirteen-E early on August22 about 370mi (595km) south-southeast of Acapulco, Mexico. A strong ridge over the southern United States, later expanding into northern Mexico, steered the system on a west-northwest course throughout its existence as a tropical cyclone.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July U-255 {{found the}} 7,168 ton Dutch {{merchant}} ship Paulus Potter abandoned and drifting, with 2,250 tons of general goods, ammunition, 34 tanks, 15 aircraft and 103 trucks aboard. The ship {{had been attacked}} by Ju 88 dive bombers of III./KG 30 east-north-east of Bear Island on 5 July, the day after Convoy PQ 17 dispersed. The crew had abandoned the badly damaged ship, believing {{it was about to}} sink. All 76 of the crew had taken <b>five</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> reach land at Novaya Zemlya, eventually being rescued by a Soviet whaling vessel. After finding her the II.WO and two mates from U-255 boarded the ship, and attempted to start the engines, but the engine room was flooded. They then searched the vessel, taking blankets, cigarettes, and other useful materials, including confidential documents found on the bridge, and the ship's ensign as a prize, before the ship was sunk with a single torpedo. U-255 returned to Narvik on 15 July.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{problems}} for filming is the environmental impact they would cause, particularly with explosions. Location manager Jaco Espach often coordinated with a special effects team to use more environmentally friendly methods. In order to film sequences involving firearms and explosives in private property, the series crew often negotiated with property owners, as well as notifying all neighbouring properties, local police and the local hospital. In the city, leaflets were distributed to the filming location a week in advance. In airport scenes, the crew would inform the aviation authorities. The action sequences {{in the beginning of the}} first episode took <b>five</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> shoot, and was filmed in the Johannesburg suburb of Yeoville. On the scenes filmed on the Kalahari, filming temporarily halted due to the spotting of venomous snakes in the area. After they retreated from some rainfall, the crew swept the area to remove them and filming continued.|$|E
5|$|At noon on October 30, the 15th Corps bombarded the Koreans with 133 large-caliber guns, 22 rocket {{launchers}} and 30 120mm heavy mortars in {{the largest}} Chinese artillery operation of the Korean War. When the bombardment ended at midnight, 10 infantry companies from the 45th and the 29th Divisions swarmed over the ROK 31st Regiment's positions and pushed the South Koreans off the summit. In {{the aftermath of the}} fighting, only 175 South Koreans survived the onslaught out of the three defending infantry companies. With the PVA 91st Regiment of the 31st Division, 12th Corps, arriving as reinforcement on November 1, the Chinese forces chased the remaining South Korean defenders off Jane Russell Hill and beat off the subsequent counterattack. Responding to the losses, the US IX Corps ordered the ROK 30th Regiment of the ROK 9th Infantry Division to take back Triangle Hill on October 31. The South Koreans launched continuous attacks for the next <b>five</b> <b>days</b> <b>to</b> no avail. Although the South Koreans failed to recapture the hill, the resulting heavy casualties forced the Chinese to call in the 93rd Regiment of the 31st Division as reinforcement on November 5. On the same day, Lieutenant General Reuben E. Jenkins, commander of the US IX Corps, suspended further attacks on Triangle Hill to prevent more casualties and to protect Sniper Ridge.|$|E
