40|$|Achieving high {{baking quality}} and {{sufficient}} yield {{is often a}} challenge in organic wheat production. The impact of sowing date (either autumn or spring) was compared regarding grain yield, baking quality and infestation with chloropid <b>gout</b> <b>fly</b> <b>of</b> seven varieties of spring wheat. The field trial was conducted in 2010, 2012 and 2013 on a sandy loam nearby Freising, Bavaria. Two varieties showed higher grain yield after autumn sowing compared to spring sowing {{in two of the}} three years. But the opposite occurred consequently for two other varieties. The other three varieties showed no consistent reaction. This different reaction may refer in the majority to a different infestation with chloropid <b>gout</b> <b>fly.</b> Additionally, a higher baking quality (protein content, wet gluten content, loaf volume) was analyzed for spring sowing compared to autumn sowing. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{research}} was conducted in Boguchwała in crops of spring wheat, in the years 2006 - 2007, and spring triticale, in the years 2008 - 2009. The aim of the {{research was}} to evaluate susceptibility of different varieties of spring triticale and spring wheat to damage caused by the spring generation <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> <b>gout</b> <b>fly.</b> The experiment was installed with the randomized blocks method in four replications. Analyses covered 9 varieties of spring triticale and 16 varieties of spring wheat. The percentage of plants damaged by barley <b>gout</b> <b>fly</b> larvae was calculated by analysing 100 successive stems in a field. The analyses were conducted when the plants were at the full milk maturity stage. The plant damage was classified using three-step rating scale. In the years of research the spring wheat showed a high degree of damage, i. e, on average 41. 6 % damaged plants, while spring triticale showed on average a low degree, 8. 9 %. Individual varieties of spring triticale and spring wheat showed a different degree <b>of</b> damage by <b>barley</b> <b>gout</b> <b>fly</b> larvae. The least susceptible to damage caused by that pest were wheat varieties: Hewilla, Griva, Żura and Koksa, and spring triticale varieties: Mieszko, Milkaro and Milewo...|$|R

40|$|Phytotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> {{extracts}} (Hordeum vulgare L.) on {{wild oat}} (Avena ludoviciana Durieu) was investigated. Water extracts five varieties <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> were bioassayed on germination and seedling growth of wild-oat {{to test the}} heterotoxicity <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> on wild-oat, study the dynamics of allelopathic potential over four growth stages and identify the most allelopathic plant part <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> in each stage. Whole barley plants were extracted at growth stage 4 (stems not developed enough), whilst for the following growth stages roots, stems, panicles and leaves were extracted separately. Seedling growth bioassays demonstrated that the wild-oat responded differently to the allelopathic potential <b>of</b> <b>barley.</b> For wild-oat radical growth and coleoptile growth were more depressed than germination, though. The allelopathic potential <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> plant parts was not stable over its life cycle for wild-oat. Leaves and stems were the most phytotoxic barley plant parts for wild-oat in the all stages. Among the varieties Eizeh appeared as the best one showing toxicity to seed germination of wild oat at its stage 4 and 8. Results suggested that the response by wild-oat varied depending on the source of allelochemicals (plant part) and the growth stage <b>of</b> the <b>barley</b> plant and kind of variety. The results leaded to conclude that Eizeh variety <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> was good to grow as it has good check on seed germination of wild oat plants {{as well as it}} also retarded the growth of root and shoot length of oat...|$|R

40|$|Mature barley lectin is a dimeric protein {{composed}} of two identical 18 -kilodalton polypeptides. The subunits <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin are initially synthesized as glycosylated proproteins, which are post-translationally processed to the mature protein preceding or concomitant with deposition <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin in vacuoles. To investigate the functional role of the glycan in processing and intracellular transport <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin to vacuoles, the sole N-linked glycosylation site residing within the COOH-terminal propeptide <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin was altered by site-directed mutagenesis. cDNA clones encoding wild-type (wt) or glycosylation-minus (gly-) barley lectin preproproteins were placed under the transcriptional control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter and introduced into Nicotiana tabacum cv Wisconsin 38. Barley lectin synthesized from both the wt and gly- constructs was processed and correctly targeted to vacuoles of tobacco leaves. Localization <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin in vacuoles processed from the nonglycosylated gly- proprotein indicated that the high-mannose glycan <b>of</b> the <b>barley</b> lectin proprotein was not essential for targeting barley lectin to vacuoles. However, pulse-chase labeling experiments demonstrated that the glycosylated wt proprotein and the nonglycosylated gly- proprotein were differentially processed to the mature protein and transported from the Golgi complex at different rates. These results implicate an indirect functional role for the glycan in post-translational processing and transport <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> lectin to vacuoles...|$|R

Results revealed that the effects of treatments were significant for number of seeds per spike, flag leaf chlorophyll, grain yield and biological yield <b>of</b> <b>barley.</b> Interaction <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> density× bitter vetch density significantly affected only grain and biological yields <b>of</b> <b>barley.</b> Maximum number <b>of</b> seeds/spike (22. 25) and leaf chlorophyll (43. 38 SPAD) was achieved at 200 and 400 barley plants/m 2, respectively. Also, maximum plant height (43. ‌ 8 cm) and number <b>of</b> seeds/spike <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> (22. 78) and minimum value of these traits (32. 9 cm and 17. 22 seeds/spike, respectively) was observed in barley sole-cropping and intercropping (adding of 60 bitter vetch seeds/m 2 to barley densities), respectively. Sole cropping <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> at 400 plants/m 2 density produced the highest grain and biological yield (288 g/m 2 and 564 g/m 2, respectively) which was not significantly different from 300 plants/m 2 treatment (260 g/m 2 and 555 g/m 2, respectively). Plant height, number of pods/plant and leaf chlorophyll of bitter vetch were significantly affected by barley densities. Maximum plant height (20 cm) and leaf chlorophyll (46. 83 SPAD) were observed at adding <b>of</b> 400 <b>barley</b> plants/m 2 to bitter vetch densities. Maximum number of pods/plant (9. 22) was in sole cropping of bitter vetch. Also, comparison of bitter vetch densities revealed that 60 plants/m 2 was superior to 20 and 40 plants/m 2 densities. Maximum land equivalent ratio (LER= 1. 81) and system productivity index (SPI= 4526) were achieved at intercropping <b>of</b> <b>barley</b> and bitter vetch with densities of 300 and 20 plants/m 2, respectively.
