We determined the stable isotopic composition of zinc in sediment cores, suspended particulate matter (SPM) and rocks collected at the Sepetiba Bay (southeastern Brazil), an estuarine lagoon heavily impacted by metallurgic activities. These isotopic signatures were compared with those from willemite ore, which represent the main mineral refined by the major industrial source of zinc. The aim was to test if this tracer system enables to identify sources and sinks of anthropogenic zinc and to reconstruct the temporal and spatial evolution of zinc contamination. The zinc isotopic compositions (expressed using the δ 66 Zn notation relative to the JMC 3 - 0749 -L solution) showed significant variations in the sediment cores, the SPM, and willemite ore minerals, ranging between − 0. 01 and + 1. 15 ‰. Spatial and temporal analysis of sediments samples fit well in a model of mixing involving three main end-members: i) Terrestrial background (δ 66 ZnJMC = + 0. 28 ± 0. 12 ‰, 2 σ); ii) marine detrital material (δ 66 ZnJMC = + 0. 45 ± 0. 03 ‰, 2 σ); and iii) a major anthropogenic source associated with <b>electroplating</b> <b>wastes</b> released into the bay (δ 66 ZnJMC = + 0. 86 ± 0. 15 ‰, 2 σ). Sediment cores collected in the mud flats showed high correlation between δ 66 Zn and zinc enrichment factors, suggesting good preservation of the isotopic records of natural and anthropogenic sources.

Experiments were conducted on these two soils spiked with ZnII, CdII, and HgII in concentrations of 612, 321, and 215 mg/kg for soil GHL and 778, 298, and 157 mg/kg for soil KAP, respectively, which simulate typical <b>electroplating</b> <b>waste</b> contamination. The removal of Zn, Cd, and Hg in soil GHL within the range of HCl concentrations was 8. 216. 5, 12. 219. 1, and 4. 36. 9 whereas these were 6. 57. 6, 8. 514. 1, and 3. 25. 2 in soil KAP. The removal of Zn, Cd, and Hg in soil GHL within the range of Mg(NO 3) 2 concentrations were 12. 228. 5, 19. 124. 6, and 18. 219. 1 whereas these were 9. 112. 1, 8. 312. 1, and 10. 648. 1 in soil KAP. For DTPA extractant, the percent removal of metal was found to be significantly higher than the other two extractants, which corroborates that DTPA is a better extractant for soil cleaning...|$|R
40|$|This is {{the final}} report {{submitted}} for the work performed under the NASA Cooperative Agreement NCC 3 - 301 for the project entitled 'In-Plant Testing of Membranes To Treat <b>Electroplating</b> <b>Waste</b> water'. The main objective of the research project {{was to determine if}} the crosslinked polyacrylic acid salt films developed by NASA scientists could be used for heavy metal removal from the wastewater generated by the metals-finishing or electroplating industry. A variety of tasks identified in the original proposal were completed. These included: (1) analysis of our industrial partner Aetna Plating's zinc electroplating process and its wastewater treatment needs for zinc removal; (2) design and construction of a laboratory-scale unit to continuously supply and remove the ion exchange films from the zinc wastewater; (3) performance of a series of runs on such a unit to determine its operating characteristics; and (4) design of a prototype unit for use at the industrial site. In addition, {{there were a number of}} tasks that had not been identified in the original proposal but were later judged to be necessary for the successful completion of the project. These were: (1) batch equilibrium and kinetic experiments with analysis of the experimental results to accurately determine the equilibrium and kinetic parameters for the ion exchange films; (2) simulation studies for proper design of the prototype unit; and (3) preliminary runs to exchange the films from H form to Calcium form...|$|R
40|$|Chromium <b>electroplating</b> <b>waste</b> water {{contains}} toxic Cr 6 + ions {{which is}} normally treated by reductive precipitation. However, in Indonesian small-medium scale electroplating industries, these processes are often ineffective {{since they are}} rather complicated to apply. Therefore, a batch-wise UV/TiO 2 photocatalysis potentially offers a more effective and easy-to-use process. In this study, waste water containing Cr 6 + similar to real industrial effluents was treated by UV/TiO 2 photocatalysis, in which photogenerated electrons could reduce highly toxic Cr 6 + to relatively harmless Cr 3 +. The photoreactor used in this investigation was a 3 -L bubble column photoreactor equipped with a 64 W low pressure UV amalgam lamp (20 W at 254 nm). Preliminary experiments showed 150 min irradiation was required per batch and 3 L min - 1 aeration {{was found to be}} optimum, resulting approximately 90 % removal of hexavalent chromium. The photoreductive treatment was not possible without a hole scavenger (such as EDTA, oxalic acid, citric acid) presence due to the fast recombination of the photogenerated electrons and holes. This investigation, in particular, focused on the two main factors affecting the effectiveness of Cr 6 + photoreductive process which were photocatalyst concentration (varied from 0. 5 to 2 g L - 1) and pH (in the range of 1 - 3). Under the experimental conditions, the removal Cr(VI) was between 76. 5 - 94. 2 %. The most cost effective conditions for the photoreduction of Cr 6 + were found at pH 1 and photocatalyst concentration of 0. 5 g L - 1 TiO 2...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — For an {{effective}} disposal of fly ash, avoiding environmental pollution, {{it is necessary}} to utilize it on a continuous basis for some beneficial purposes. The present study investigated the feasibility and effectiveness of the fly ash along with lime precipitated waste sludge and cement. The Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) tests were carried out on the specimens comprising of fly ash (FA), (5 to 35 %) lime precipitated <b>electroplating</b> <b>waste</b> sludge (S) and (2 - 20 %) cement at 7 and 28 days of curing periods. The results of UCS tests indicated that the strength of fly ash increases substantially on addition of lime precipitated sludge and cement. It has been observed that compressive strengths of cement stabilized fly ash were smaller than the cement-sludge stabilized mix. It has also been observed that the strength was increasing upto 20 % sludge addition to fly ash-cement mix, however, the strength started decreasing on further addition of sludge beyond 20 % to the fly ash-cement combination. The most effective percentage of fly ash-cement-sludge was found as 72 %FA+ 20 %S+ 8 %C. The UCS of this mix was found as 18 and 25 MPa at 7 and 28 days of curing respectively. This is substantially higher than the UCS of plain fly ash (1. 0 and 2. 5 MPa) at the same curing periods respectively. The X-ray analyses of some selected samples using EDX technique were also carried to study the elemental analyses of the various mixes. The EDX data showed that the experimental results obtain by UCS tests were in conformity with the chemical findings of ED...|$|R
40|$|Effluent that is produce by the {{electroplating}} industry, especially {{nickel chrome}} plating, contains chromemetal that is carcinogenic. The toxicities from chrome {{are caused by}} its ability to dissolve and it’s mobilityin the environment. An alternative treatment to reduce chrome is called fitoremediasi which uses plants asits indicator; in this case we use water hyacinth. At the preface experiment, we tried to plant mature water hyacinth in <b>electroplating</b> <b>waste.</b> First we tried toplant in 100 % waste water in witch we repeated it 3 times. At the 3 rd week; day 18; the plants becameyellowish and became wilted. Knowing this fact, we applied the time for our experiment the we were goingto executed, with assuming at the 18 th day the plants will become wilted as an indicator that the waterhyacinth are saturated in adsorbing chrome as the heavy metal pollutant. This became the parameter indesigning the time treatment for the plant zone, 4 until 15 days. The treatment was done by making variation {{in the amount of}} plants that are planted, which was 0 plants(as the control), 1 plant, 2 plants, 3 plants, and 4 plants; with 3 times repeating at each stage. The result ofthis experiment after 18 days shows the chrome concentration and the efficiently in decreasing theconcentration on each stage. The highest efficiently for each plant was the treatment by 1 plant only. Thehighest efficiently in decreasing the concentration was 78, 95 % ad it was done by the treatment with 4 plants. To get chrom concentration which is fill with the standard, we can add more water hyacinth into thewaste with the balance equivalent or we need the lower beginning concentration...|$|R
40|$|Research of {{chromium}} (VI) separation {{has been}} done using polymer inclusion membrane (PIM) method. This study aims to generate PIM, separate the metal ion chromium (VI) using PIM and {{determine the effect of}} the concentration of the feed phase, the thickness of the membrane and the amount of usage of the membrane for ion chromium (VI) diffusion. Polymer inclusion membrane (PIM) was made by mixing Aliquat 336 -TBP as carrier compounds, PVC as the base polymer, DBE as a plasticizer and THF as a solvent. PIM membrane was placed between the source of analyte as a feed phase and result of the separation as a receiver phase. Feed phase was <b>electroplating</b> <b>waste</b> metal containing chromium (VI) at pH 4, while the receiver phase was a 2 N NaCl solution with a pH 6. 7. The change of variables in this study were the concentration of the feed phase at various dilution i. e., 100 x, 50 x and 10 x, the thickness of the membrane i. e., 25 μm, 20 μm and 10 μm, and the time of membrane using i. e., 1, 2 and 3 times. The concentration of chromium (VI) diffused after separation process was analyzed by atomic absorption spectroscopy (AAS). The stability of membrane was observed by analyzing the presence of membrane’s component in the feed phase and in the receiver phase. The analysis was conducted by UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Meanwhile, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis was used to determine the morphology of membrane surface. The results showed that the chromium ion concentration diffused from the feed phase was 99. 24 %, meanwhile the 85. 88 % of it diffused to the receiving phase. The highest Cr(VI) ions diffusion was occured at the first use of PIM membrane with a thickness of 10 μm and the concentration of the feed phase was 10. 55 ppm (resulted from 100 times dilution). Therefore, it can be concluded that the diffusion of chromium (VI) ion was influenced by the concentration of feed phase, the thickness of membrane and the number of membrane application...|$|R
