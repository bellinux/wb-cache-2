50|$|The Sandwalk Adventures is {{a graphic}} novel created by Assistant Professor of Biology at Juniata College, Jay Hosler. It was {{originally}} published in 2001 as five comic books, and republished as into a single graphic novel in 2003. The Sandwalk Adventures is the tale of <b>follicle</b> <b>mites</b> living in the left eyebrow of Charles Darwin himself. The mites believe Darwin to be a god, one of their creation myths handed down from generation to generation, {{and he has to}} set them straight about that and other mite fables. A humorous series of illustrated lessons in natural selection and evolution ensues.|$|R
5000|$|Demodex bovis, {{also known}} as the cattle <b>follicle</b> <b>mite,</b> usually causes demodicosis, or demodectic mange, in cattle. This disease is common in {{tropical}} areas and is not usually found in temperate environments. [...] Demodicosis is characterized by the formation of papules and nodules over the cattle's skin. These lesions most commonly occur on the neck, shoulders, and armpit of cattle; however, sometimes they also appear on the udder. This condition is often found in cattle with increased stress from pregnancy or lactation. Natural and acquired immunity can cause a {{decrease in the number of}} mites infesting a cow as well as decreasing the severity of a cow's symptoms.|$|R
25|$|Demodicosis, {{also known}} as demodectic mange, is caused by Demodex canis mites which live in small numbers in sebaceous glands and hair <b>follicles.</b> These <b>mites</b> can cause {{inflammation}} and hair loss, and may also lead to secondary bacterial infections such as fever, lethargy, and enlarged lymph nodes.|$|R
50|$|Jay Hosler is {{the author}} and {{illustrator}} of science-oriented comics. He {{is best known for}} his graphic novels Clan Apis, The Sandwalk Adventures, and Optical Allusions. Clan Apis, a Xeric Foundation Award winner, follows the life of a honey bee named Nyuki; the story conveys factual information about honey bees in a humorous fashion as Nyuki learns about each new stage of her life. The Sandwalk Adventures, an Eisner Award nominee, follows a conversation about evolution between Charles Darwin and a <b>follicle</b> <b>mite</b> living in his left eyebrow. Optical Allusions, funded in part by a National Science Foundation grant, explains the evolution of the eye and vision by following the story of Wrinkles the Wonderbrain. Hosler is also an entomologist and associate professor of biology at Juniata College.|$|R
40|$|Summary We {{present a}} 35 -year-old patient with {{acquired}} immunodeficiency syndrome who had demodici-dosis on his face, characterized by multiple papules and papulopustules, associated pruritus, numerous mites on skin-surface biopsy and in biopsy specimens, and rapid response to topical treatment with permethrin. It seems likely that Demodex infestation does not manifest unless local or systemic immune function is altered, leading to the proliferation of the organism and subsequent disease. Key words: {{acquired immunodeficiency syndrome}}, Demodex folliculitis, Demodex mites, demodici-dosis, rosacea-like dermatosis The hair <b>follicle</b> <b>mites</b> Demodex folliculorum and D. brevis are common inhabitants of the human pilosebaceous unit. 1 D. folliculorum is more common than D. brevis and {{is characterized by a}} larger size, an elongated posterior segment, and arrowhead-shaped eggs. It is usually located in the follicular infundibulum and may be present in numbers up to 10 ± 15 per follicle. I...|$|R
50|$|The adult mites {{are only}} 0.3 - 0.4 mm long, with D. brevis {{slightly}} shorter than D. folliculorum. Each has a semitransparent, elongated body {{that consists of}} two fused segments. Eight short, segmented legs {{are attached to the}} first body segment. The body is covered with scales for anchoring itself in the hair <b>follicle,</b> and the <b>mite</b> has pin-like mouthparts for eating skin cells and oils (sebum) which accumulate in the hair <b>follicles.</b> The <b>mites</b> can leave the hair follicles and slowly walk around on the skin, at a speed of 8 - 16 cm per hour, especially at night, as they try to avoid light. The mites are transferred between hosts through contact with hair, eyebrows, and the sebaceous glands of the face.|$|R
40|$|Understanding of {{reproductive}} biology in canids, including the domestic dog, is surprisingly limited. This includes the regulators of ovarian follicle development, and mechanisms of anestrus termination, fertilization and embryo development. In turn, {{this lack of}} understanding has limited our ability to develop assisted reproductive technologies (ART) for endangered canid conservation efforts. ART of interest include in vitro follicle culture for maternal genome rescue, estrus induction protocols, and in vitro fertilization (IVF). Here, we describe: 1) Studies evaluating the stage-specific requirements for follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), and activin on domestic <b>dog</b> <b>follicle</b> development in vitro. We demonstrate the beneficial effects of FSH and activin on growth, and activin on antrum expansion and oocyte health in short term culture. 2) Evaluation of serum collected during the anestrus to estrus transition revealing {{a significant increase in}} anti-Müllerian hormone (AMH) during proestrus, likely originating from increased numbers of antral follicles during this time. 3) The birth of the first live puppies from IVF embryos utilizing in vivo matured oocytes. Further, consistently high rates of embryo production are obtained using the described system, with no effect of progesterone supplementation to embryo culture media. Improved knowledge of the drivers of follicle development inform understanding of the resumption of estrus cyclicity, which in turn is needed to explore mechanisms of oocyte maturation prior to fertilization. In vitro fertilization is also required to assess the developmental capacity of oocytes grown from cultured follicles. Thus, these combined discoveries represent significant advancements in the understanding of canid reproductive biology and potential application to development of ART for the management of biomedical research colonies and for endangered canid conservation. 2020 - 08 - 1...|$|R
5000|$|Demodicosis {{occurs when}} female mites lay eggs in hair {{follicle}}s. Each follicle may contain {{hundreds or thousands}} of mites, which leads to the formation of skin papules and nodules. These papules and nodules, or bumps beneath the skin, can be felt even before they can be seen. [...] Typically, the papules and nodules last for a month and then are replaced with new ones. They typically are found in the greatest numbers during spring and summer months. Their size can range from as small as a pinhead to as large as a chicken egg. The larger ones are formed when the cysts grow in size, forming granulomatous nodules, characterized by the blocking of the opening of the <b>follicle</b> by <b>mites,</b> keratin, and other remnants. These large cysts can burst, which causes open wounds to form. The thick pus-like substance that comes out of these sores contains Demodex bovis, which can be spread to other animals. Another way mites can be spread is when female <b>mites</b> leave the <b>follicle</b> they are in and go lay eggs in a new follicle. This form of transfer can spread the condition to different follicles on an already infected cow as well as to other cows and animals through copulation or other physical contact. For instance, mites may be transmitted to calves within a few days of nursing, when the shoulders and hips of calves contact the infected mother.|$|R
50|$|One genus of mites, Demodex, has {{adapted to}} infesting the hair follicles of its hosts. These mites remain {{external}} to the true outer layer of the skin (the epidermis) which also lines the tube of the hair <b>follicle.</b> However, the <b>mites</b> appear to be deep within the skin {{in the sense of}} being below the general outer surface of the host. The mites fit in the narrow space between the hair and the tube of the follicle. They may also crawl out onto the general epidermal surface of their host. Transmission of these mites from host to host occurs during close contact when young animals are suckled. Demodex mites are morphologically adapted to this constricted habitat: microscopic, worm shaped, and with very short legs. The mites feed on cells of the epidermal lining of the hair follicle. Many species of mammals, including humans, are readily infested with these mites, but typically the density of infestation is very low. However they are considered parasitic in people with weakened immune systems.|$|R
40|$|An adult {{castrated}} male Doberman Pinscher {{was presented}} with a 6 -month history of well-demarcated alopecic patches with reticulated hyperpigmentation and fine peripheral scaling on the axillae, thorax, abdomen, inguinal region, and thighs. The dog later developed hyperthermia, lethargy, apparent joint pain, peripheral lymphadenomegaly, vomiting, and diarrhea. Relevant laboratory tests results included anemia, thrombocytopenia, proteinuria, and an elevated antinuclear antibodies serum titer. Histologically, skin biopsy specimens had a lymphocyte-rich interface dermatitis and interface mural folliculitis ending in follicular destruction. Altogether, these signs were consistent with a unique alopecic variant of chronic cutaneous lupus erythematosus, eventually associated {{with the development of}} systemic lupus erythematosus. This rare form of chronic cutaneous lupus needs {{to be added to the}} expanding list of lymphocyte-mediated autoimmune alopecias in dogs. Keywords alopecia, autoimmunity, <b>dog</b> diseases, hair <b>follicle,</b> lupus In humans, the classification of cutaneous manifestations of lupus erythematosus (LE) is based on 2 factors. 8 First, LE-associated dermatoses are separated into those with microscopic lesions specific for LE (ie, a lymphocyte-ric...|$|R
40|$|Glycoconjugate {{modifications}} were analysed in the zona pellucida during {{development of}} oocytes in dog and cat using conventional histochemical staining methods {{with or without}} previous carbohydrate digestion. A series of lectins combined with desulphation and sialic acid degradation were applied. No differences were observed between <b>dog</b> and cat <b>follicles</b> using conventional histochemical staining methods. In both species, the zona pellucida and follicular fluid/intercellular matrix strongly reacted with PAS and high iron diamine stain (HID) and reacted moderately with low iron diamine stain (LID). Treatment with testicular hyaluronidase, chondroitinase ABC, chondroitinase AC and chondroitinase B treatment diminished HID and LID positivity of follicular fluid and intercellular matrix. Lectins that gave the most intense staining of the zona pellucida of both species were SBA, PNA, RCA-I, GSA-IB 4 and WGA, indicating the presence of beta-D-GalNAc, D-Gal and GlcNAc residues. Sulpho- and asulpho-carbohydrates were identified in terminal and/or subterminal positions linked to sialic acid residues. In conclusion, {{the results indicate that}} glycosaminoglycans are not present in the zona pellucida of both species. Differences were observed in carbohydrate residues and in their spatial distribution, depending on species and developmental stage of the follicles. The similarity in lectin affinity between ooplasm and zona pellucida of oocytes present in follicles at different stages of development confirm the involvement of oocytes in zona pellucida production...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND Noninflammatory {{alopecia}} is {{a frequent}} problem in dogs. Estrogen-induced alopecia is well described in dogs, with estrogen producing testicular tumors and canine female hyperestrogenism. OBJECTIVES To increase awareness that extensive alopecia in dogs {{can be caused by}} exposure to estradiol gel used by owners to treat their postmenopausal symptoms. ANIMALS Skin biopsies from five dogs with extensive alopecia were examined. METHODS Owners were asked for a thorough case history, including possible exposure to an estradiol gel. Complete blood work and serum chemistry panel analysis were performed to investigate possible underlying causes. Formalin-fixed skin biopsy samples were obtained from lesional skin and histopathology was performed. RESULTS All owners confirmed the use of a transdermal estradiol gel and close contact with the affected dogs before development of alopecia. Histopathologic examination showed a similar picture in all five <b>dogs.</b> Most hair <b>follicles</b> were predominantly either in kenogen or telogen and hair follicle infundibula showed mild to moderate dilation. Hair regrowth was present in all five dogs after the exposure to the estradiol gel was stopped or minimized. Blood work and serum chemistry panel were within normal limits in all cases. One dog had elevated estradiol concentrations, whereas in another dog estradiol concentrations were within normal limits. CONCLUSION AND CLINICAL IMPORTANCE Alopecia can occur after contact with a transdermal gel used as treatment for postmenopausal symptoms in women. Estradiol gel used by female owners therefore represents a possible cause for noninflammatory alopecia in dogs. Estradiol concentrations are not necessarily elevated in affected dogs...|$|R
40|$|Acne {{is one of}} the commonest skin {{diseases}} that dermatologists have to treat. The diagnosis of acne is usually made from the finding of the following aspects: 1) clinical features: acne vulgaris is characterized by a mixture of non-inflamed (open and closed comedones) and inflamed (papules, pustules, nodules) lesions; 2) topography of acne lesions, which involve face, back and chest; 3) epidemiology of the disease. Although acne may affect persons of all ages, the disease is most prevalent and most severe during adolescence; 4) occurrence of scars. Scarring represents a frequent outcome of acne and can lead to lifelong concern in regarding self-esteem. Even thought the diagnosis of acne is usually readily made, acne may be confused with several diseases, which can have a similar appearance. The following acneiform disorders may represent a differential diagnostic challenge for clinicians. Drug-induced acneiform eruptions are often sudden on onset and are usually more monomorphous in their appearance than acne vulgaris. A history of drug assumption is diriment for diagnosis, while the eruption resolves spontaneously following removal of the offending agent. Rosacea occurs most commonly in adults and is clinically characterized by facial flushing and erythema of the cheeks, nose, forehead and chin. Papules and pustules can develop within the areas of erythema. Scarring does not occur. Rosacea fulminans is an explosive form of rosacea, characterized by monstrous coalescent inflammatory lesions. Comedones are notably absent. The disease resolves with no or minimal scarring. In perioral dermatitis, erythema, scaling and small papules and pustules typically occur around the mouth and on the chin. Gram-negative folliculitis is characterized by the sudden development of superficial pustules in patients who have been treated for acne with antibiotics, which are ineffective in the long run. Bacteriology reveals a wide range of Gram-negative bacteria. Follicular pyodermas may mimic acne, especially when an acne-like distribution pattern is observed. However, the absence of comedones may suggest the proper diagnosis. Demodecidosis is a persistent disease of facial <b>follicles</b> due to <b>mites</b> of the species Demodex folliculorum and Demodex species. Comedones and scars are lacking and most of patients are 50 - 70 years of age. Diagnosis rests on demonstration of large numbers of mites. These represent only some of the skin disorders which may be misdiagnosed as acne vulgaris. An accurate evaluation of the clinical and history clues of acne is essential in properly diagnose and treat the disease...|$|R
