The minimum energy principle is applied, regarding the <b>isolated</b> <b>plate</b> {{as part of}} an infinitely wide stiffened panel, reinforced by longitudinal stiffeners and transverse beams, despite of classical solutions, where two coupled transcendental equations are solved. The displacement field is developed into double sine trigonometric series and the solution convergence, in terms of buckling coefficients, is investigated. Simple design buckling formulas for <b>isolated</b> <b>plate</b> panels, as function of supporting members’ torque and warping rigidity ratios, are derived by curve fitting.

Microdictyon plates are primarily known from single, isolated, perforated phosphatic sclerites; only one species (M. sinicum) from the Chengjiang Lagerstätte is known from soft-bodied preservation of the complete organism. The <b>isolated</b> <b>plates</b> from South Australia display {{a wide range of}} morphologies potentially reflecting: 1, considerable diversification within the group at this time; 2, extensive intraspecific morphological variation; 3, different plate morphotypes along the trunk of the animal; or 4, significant ontogenetic variation in successive growth stages. The South Australian specimens are similar to several individual sclerites described from other Cambrian palaeocontinents, but appear closest to faunas described from South China. Problems associated with the taxonomy of <b>isolated</b> Microdictyon <b>plates</b> are discussed, including the lack of knowledge associated with intraspecific and/or ontogenetic variability and how individual plate morphology may relate to size or relative position {{along the length of the}} complete organism. 17 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The local {{buckling}} capacity of fire exposed thin-walled steel cross sections {{is affected by}} the reduction in strength and stiffness due to elevated temperatures and the amplitude of the initial local imperfections. A usual method to estimate this capacity is the simulation of <b>isolated</b> <b>plates</b> (web: four sides simply supported plate, flange: three sides simply supported plate) that are subjected to in-plane compression until instability is observed. Several researchers have proposed design methods to calculate the capacity of these steel members at elevated temperatures based on <b>isolated</b> <b>plate</b> analysis, but they used different methodologies. This variability in hypotheses happens because there is no clear provision defining the numerical modeling procedure for fire design of steel plates in the codes (European or US). The paper proposes a methodology for finite element simulation of thin plates at elevated temperatures and its governing factors (amplitude of initial local imperfections, number of half-wave geometry of local imperfections, plate geometry (sides ratio a/b)) ...|$|R

40|$|Gogia parsleyi Zamora sp. nov. and Gogia sp. are {{described}} {{from two different}} echinoderm assemblages, both from the middle Cambrian of the Murero Formation (Iberian Chains, NE Spain). Gogia parsleyi is reconstructed and described {{on the basis of}} fifteen complete or partial specimens and numerous <b>isolated</b> <b>plates.</b> It is characterised by spiralled brachioles, simple epispires, sometimes covered by stereomic domes or tiny cover plates, and by thecal plates arranged in subregular circlets. This gogiid population comprises juveniles, advanced juveniles and mature individuals. The material was found in {{the upper part of the}} Murero Formation (upper Caesaraugustian–lower Languedocian). Gogia sp. is represented by two almost complete specimens and several <b>isolated</b> <b>plates</b> from the lower part of the Murero Formation (lower Caesar− augustian). The genus Gogia was first described in Western Gondwana from the Languedocian (upper middle Cambrian) of France, but the material from Spain is older and represents the oldest record of this genus in Gondwana, suggesting an early migration from Laurentia. The gogiids are well preserved in two echinoderm Lagerstätten, which, together with other echinoderms, comprise the majority of the fossil fauna. Both levels are derived from obrution deposits produced in calm and open marine conditions, sometimes affected by sporadic storms. Their holdfast morphology suggests that these gogiids were low−tier suspension feeders, living attached to trilobite fragments in a soft, muddy environment...|$|R
40|$|Buckling {{strength}} predictions {{are presented}} {{for a wide}} range of thin isotropic skew plates. The key studied parameters include the aspect ratio, skew angle, and rotational restraint stiffness on the different edges of the plate. The buckling strengths are evaluated both for <b>isolated</b> <b>plates</b> and for plates that are continuous with other parts of the structure. The assumed loading is uniform, uniaxial compression. The buckling predictions are presented in the form of dimensionless buckling curves, which permit a ready adoption into the “data sheets” commonly used in current design.

The curves also illustrate the complex character of the buckling mode changes that take place with a change in aspect ratio in skew plate structures. In addition, these mode changes lead to well defined local optima, which the designer can exploit if he has control over the aspect ratio of a skew plate...|$|R

40|$|New {{buckling}} interaction {{results are}} presented for skew plates and prismatic assemblies of plates, which illustrate the influence of continuity over supports {{for a range of}} aspect-ratio and loading combinations. The work follows from initial comparisons (York and Williams, 1995) with those in the literature for <b>isolated</b> <b>plates</b> and stiffened benchmark panels, consisting of prismatic assemblies of plates. The analysis method, which is an enhancement to the existing computer program VICONOPT, is based on an ‘exact’ analytical solution using Classical Plate Theory. This accounts for an infinitely long prismatic plate assembly supported at regular intervals over supports with general skew angle, alpha, forming a series of skew plates or plate assemblies joined end to end. This modelling can be described as exhibiting uni-axial continuity. The enhancement relates to a recent modification of the recurrence equations, which now accounts for infinitely wide skew plate assemblies supported at regular transverse intervals. This modelling possesses bi-axial continuity...|$|R
