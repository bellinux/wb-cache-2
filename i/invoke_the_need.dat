Diagnosis of PCD is challenging, and genetic testing is hampered by the high heterogeneity of the disease, because autosomal recessive causative mutations were found in 34 different genes. In this study, we clinically and molecularly characterized a cohort of 51 Italian patients with clinical signs of PCD. A custom next-generation sequencing panel that enables the affordable and simultaneous screening of 24 PCD genes was developed for genetic analysis. After variant filtering and prioritization, the molecular diagnosis of PCD was achieved in 43 % of the patients.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the promises made in education policy regarding people’s future education, employment and social mobility. Specifically, the paper analyses how the term ‘potential’ functions in education policy texts and discourses to make tacit promises at an affective level. Contemporary education policies often <b>invoke</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> to realise personal and national economic potential, and {{speak of the}} risk of ‘wasted potential’, when justifying reform agendas directed at both increasing human capital investment and reducing educational inequity. Drawing on the work of Gilles Deleuze, the paper develops a philosophical concept of potential that provides a theoretical framework for the analysis. The aim of the paper is to analyse how the term ‘potential’ functions in policy to: (a) couple economic and equity purposes for education; and (b) imply a relationship between talent, opportunity and aspiration, and particular a distribution of responsibility between governments and citizens for ‘realising potential’. While primarily theoretical, the paper is informed by analyses of interview data and documents in two research projects: (1) a small pilot study of higher education equity policy in England and Australia since the mid- 1990 s and (2) a study of the expansion of human capital theory and large-scale educational assessments to include non-cognitive skills.

40|$|Background: In Honduras, {{research}} capacity strengthening (RCS) has {{not received}} sufficient attention, but an increase in research competencies would enable local scientists to advance knowledge and contribute to national priorities, including the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Objective: This project aimed at strengthening research capacity in infectious diseases in Honduras, focusing on the School of Microbiology of the National Autonomous University of Honduras (UNAH). The primary objective {{was the creation of}} a research-based graduate program for the continued training of researchers. Parallel objectives included institutional strengthening and the facilitation of partnerships and networks. Methods: Based on a multi-stakeholder consultation, an RCS workplan was designed and undertaken from 2007 to 2012. Due to unexpected adverse circumstances, the first 2 years were heavily dedicated to implementing the project&#x 0027;s flagship, an MSc program in infectious and zoonotic diseases (MEIZ). In addition, infrastructure improvements and demand-driven continuing education opportunities were facilitated; biosafety and research ethics knowledge and practices were enhanced, and networks fostering collaborative work were created or expanded. Results: The project coincided with the peak of UNAH&#x 0027;s radical administrative reform and an unprecedented constitutional crisis. Challenges notwithstanding, in September 2009, MEIZ admitted the first cohort of students, all of whom undertook MDG-related projects graduating successfully by 2012. Importantly, MEIZ has been helpful in expanding the School of Microbiology&#x 0027;s traditional etiology-based, disciplinary model to infectious disease teaching and research. By fulfilling its objectives, the project contributed to a stronger research culture upholding safety and ethical values at the university.

This article {{examines}} {{the relationship between the}} state and the mass media in Malaysia through an analysis of the March 2004 general elections that led to the victory of the incumbent Barisan Nasional (BN) coalition party and its leader Abdullah Ahmad Badawi. Through restrictive laws that limit press freedom and the concentration of press ownership among a limited group of pro-BN individuals, the Malaysian state has been exercising control over the mass media, thus impeding the Malaysian electorates democratic right to freedom of information. Through an investigation of mainstream and Chinese media coverage of the 2004 elections, it can be observed that the Malaysian press overwhelmingly presented a sympathetic, and often flaunting, bias in favor of the incumbent BN while providing insufficient coverage of the views ofor even demonizingthe opposition parties. Like other ruling entities of developing countries, the BN government justifies its intrusion over the mass media by <b>invoking</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for national stability and security in order to successfully lead the Malaysian nation-state toward modernization, development, and economic prosperity.

The emphasis on day raises at least two questions for the sociological study of sleep: the first concerns the existence of a ‘sleep habitus’ and whether sleeping bodies can ever be ‘unruly’. The second involves the possibilities for breaching or mediating any such ‘sleep habitus’. What we suggest here is that any ‘sleep habitus’ does appear to be limited. If a sleeper is considered to be ‘unconscious’, in a private space, and in an intimate relationship with his or her audience, bodies appear free to do anything without <b>invoking</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for embarrassment. However, at the same time, couples do suggest that sleeping bodies can feel embarrassed, and thus can experience failed ‘impression management’. Gender and length of relationship appear important factors here. For example, as a relationship becomes ‘routinized’ couples learn to ‘fit together’, and to ‘mutually adapt’. Although, this fitting together negates the requirement for ‘private’ embarrassment, it may actually increase the likelihood that the private is ‘leaked’ into the public domain and thus, augment the possibilities for ‘reputational’ embarrassment...|$|R

The regulation {{of the decision to}} differentiate was then examined in hybrids between differentiation- defective myoblasts and differentiation-competent myoblasts.

The mechanism of formation of localized Ca 2 + signals was examined using a novel approach involving photolysis of caged carbachol inside a patch pipette attached to the basal surface of an acinar unit. This local activation of basal muscarinic receptors elicited local cytosolic Ca 2 + spikes in the apical pole more than 15 μm away {{from the site of}} stimulation. In some experiments, local basal receptor activation elicited a Ca 2 + wave that started in the apical pole and then spread toward the base. Currently, there are two competing hypotheses for preferential apical Ca 2 + signaling. One <b>invokes</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for structural proximity of the cholinergic receptors and the Ca 2 + release channels in the apical pole, whereas the other postulates long distance communication between basal receptors and the channels. Our intrapipette uncaging experiments provide definitive evidence for long distance communication between basal muscarinic receptors and apical Ca 2 + release channels...|$|R
40|$|A {{ground-breaking}} comparative {{treatment of}} cinematic images of atrocity, combining critical perspectives on contemporary film and human rights. A {{few days after}} 9 / 11, US Vice-President Dick Cheney <b>invoked</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for <b>the</b> USA to work 'the dark side' in its global 'War on Terror'. Cinema of the Dark Side explores how contemporary cinema treats state-sponsored atrocity, evoking multiple landscapes of state terror. Investigating the ethical potential of cinematic atrocity images, this book argues that while films help to create and confirm normative perceptions about atrocities, they can also disrupt those perceptions and build alternatives. Asserting a crucial distinction between morality and ethics, a new conceptualisation of human rights cinema is proposed, one that repositions human rights morality within an ethical framework that reflects upon the causes and contexts of violence. It builds upon theories of embodied spectatorship to offer {{a new perspective on}} the ethics of spectatorship, providing readers with fresh insights into how we respond to atrocity images and the ethical issues at stake. Covering a diverse spectrum of 21 st century cinema, this books deals with documentary or fictional representations of atrocity such as state-sanctioned torture, genocide, enforced disappearance, deportation, and apartheid. Key Features: A comprehensive treatment of cinematic images of atrocity as a genre, featuring close, comparative analysis of recent films; A unique perspective on the ethics of spectatorship, based upon a multi-sensory approach to the film medium; A critical introduction to debates on cinematic identification...|$|R
40|$|The gradual {{deterioration}} {{and failure}} of old buildings, bridges and other civil engineering structures <b>invoked</b> <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) systems {{to develop a}} means to monitor the health of structures. Dozens of sensing, processing and monitoring mechanisms have been implemented and widely deployed with wired sensors. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs), on the other hand, are networks {{of large numbers of}} low cost wireless sensor nodes that communicate through a wireless media. The complexity nature and high cost demand of the highly used wired traditional SHM systems have posed <b>the</b> <b>need</b> for replacement with WSNs. However, the major fact that wireless sensor nodes have memory and power supply limitations has been an issue and many efficient options have been proposed to solve this problem and preserve the long life of the network. This is the reason why data processing algorithms in WSNs focus mainly on the accomplishment of efficient utilization of these scarce resources. In this thesis, we design a low-power and memory efficient data processing algorithm using in-place radix- 2 integer Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). This algorithm requires inputs with integer values; hence, increases the memory efficiency by more than 40 % and highly saves processor power consumption over the traditional floating-point implementation. A standard-deviation-based peak picking algorithm is next applied to measure the natural frequency of the structure. The algorithms together with Contiki, a lightweight open source operating system for networked embedded systems, are loaded on Z 1 Zolertia sensor node. Analogue Device’s ADXL 345 digital accelerometer on board is used to collect vibration data. The bridge model used to test the target algorithm is a simply supported beam in the lab. ...|$|R
