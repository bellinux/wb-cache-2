Facing <b>investor</b> <b>redemptions,</b> cash poor funds are {{likely to engage in}} forced fire sale while cash rich funds are likely to engage in voluntary information sale. Other market participants are unwilling to provide liquidity to stocks held or sold by cash rich funds, since any selling on these stocks {{is more likely to be}} due to adverse selection. In contrast, any selling on stocks held or sold by cash poor funds is likely to be driven by funding liquidity needs followed by future price reversal...|$|E

40|$|There is {{no legal}} or {{regulatory}} {{of what constitutes}} a hedge fund, though the generally accepted definition is that they are unregulated pools that invest in any asset class as well as derivative securities and use long and short positions, as well as leverage where the manager is compensated with a proportion of the returns. Hedge funds are not new, Alfred Winslow Jones in generally credited with the formation of the first hedge fund in 1949, however the industry remained small and relatively unnoticed for many years. In 1990, there were just 610 hedge funds managing approximately $ 39 bn of capital, however by the end of 2007 the industry had grown to over 10, 000 funds managing almost $ 2 trn of capital. The credit crisis of 2008 which has caused hedge funds to suffer both investment losses and <b>investor</b> <b>redemption</b> means that as of the end of 2008 the industry has contracted with over 1, 000 funds closing and the capital being reduced to $ 1. 5 btrn...|$|R
40|$|The Global Financial Crisis {{has seen}} investors {{withdraw}} funds from investment schemes {{around the world}} seeking the safe harbour of cash and bonds. As new investment dried up and <b>investor</b> <b>redemptions</b> were lodged in record numbers, a raft of Ponzi and pyramid-like schemes have been uncovered. Like the promises made by Charles Ponzi to New England residents in the 1920 s, the US$ 65 billion swindle overseen by Bernard L. Madoff has shaken investor confidence. In {{the wake of the}} Madoff scandal, the number of Ponzi-type scams being identified around the world has increased at a concerning rate. This phenomenon, popularly termed 'Ponzimonium', represents another significant challenge to investors and regulators alike in the post-GFC environment. This paper considers some of the red flags that surround the Madoff scandal and those aspects of external control that failed to identify the fraud earlier and highlights the need for a proactive approach to fraud detection.

40|$|In my PhD thesis I unveil {{somewhat}} controversial trading {{practices and}} conflicts of interests in mutual fund industry and brokerage business. I aim to provide empirical evidence of premature information diffusion in capital markets. The novel data and identification {{approach of the}} study allows answering the questions so far not answered in the literature. In Chapter I of my thesis, I study a pre-release of research information by brokerage houses to their important clients. Using high-frequency trading data from Abel Noser Solutions (ANcerno), I investigate trading of individual institutions ahead of recommendation release. I find that large institutions and frequent traders trade {{in the direction of}} the Strong Buy and Buy initiations in the 5 -day period before the announcement. In Chapter 2, prepared in collaboration with Alexander Eisele and Gianpaolo Paise, I investigate private information flows and trading practices inside mutual fund families when one of the funds in the family experiences a severe distress due to <b>investor</b> <b>redemptions.</b> The main academic contribution of the research paper is the empirical evidence in support of a family-coordinated predation of the distressed funds inside investment fund families...|$|E
50|$|Asset-backed {{securities}} and MBSs typically contain issue terms that specify a method through which redeeming principal is shared among <b>investors.</b> When <b>redemption</b> is done pro-rata, a pool factor {{is useful to}} investors in cases of early repayment. Early repayment reduces the amount of collateral available for an issue, and therefore some of the outstanding principal is returned to investors {{as stated in the}} issue terms. In this case, the pool factor is used to indicate how the remaining outstanding principal is adequately securitized.|$|R

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. In the thesis, we investigate whether hedge fund managers have liquidity timing skills in the fixed income market, foreign exchange market and commodity market, respectively. Managers with the liquidity timing skills can strategically adjust hedge funds exposure to the target financial market based on their forecasts about the future changes in market liquidity. We find empirical evidence that hedge funds in certain categories have the skills to time the liquidity levels in the fixed income market, foreign exchange market and commodity market. We conduct a range of robustness tests, which show that hedge funds still exhibit liquidity timing skills after controlling for the factors that may affect timing ability. In particular, our findings are robust to the usage of leverage, funding constraints, <b>investor</b> <b>redemption</b> restrictions, hedge funds trades on market liquidity, financial crisis, hedge fund data biases, market return and volatility timing, liquidity risk factor, systematic stale pricing and option factors. We also conduct bootstrap analysis to ensure the results are not dependent on the normality assumption. Our investigation is helpful to {{understand the importance of}} market liquidity to hedge funds professional portfolio management...|$|R
2500|$|This is a {{bank run}} {{in the sense that}} there is a {{mismatch}} in maturities, and thus a money fund is a [...] "virtual bank": the assets of money funds, while short term, nonetheless typically have maturities of several months, while <b>investors</b> can request <b>redemption</b> at any time, without waiting for obligations to come due. Thus if there is a sudden demand for redemptions, the assets may be liquidated in a fire sale, depressing their sale price.|$|R
50|$|ETNs are a {{significant}} innovation to improve liquidity of structured products. Unlike other buy-and-hold structured products, ETNs can be bought and sold during normal trading hours on the securities exchange. For institutional size <b>redemption,</b> <b>investors</b> may offer their ETN for repurchase by the issuer on a weekly basis. Investors can easily track {{the performance of their}} ETN. In this sense, ETNs are structured to resemble ETFs. But ETNs are different from ETFs, as they consist of a debt instrument with cash flows derived from the performance of an underlying asset - a structured product.|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{several questions}} in financial economics. A common thread {{is the study}} of conditional distributions and higher moments. The first chapter proposes state-dependent, idiosyncratic tail risk as a key driver of asset pricing dynamics. In standard models, the only sources of priced macroeconomic risk govern time- variation in aggregate consumption and/or preferences. When markets are incomplete, agents care not just about the level of consumption, but also its redistribution across agents. Administrative earnings data suggest that the conditional tails of the cross-sectional distribution of labor income growth rates are highly cyclical; its left and right tails become fatter and thinner, respectively, in recessions. These features are consistent with a model in which households are exposed to rare, very large shocks and the probability of these shocks varies over time. My paper measures, prices, and demonstrates the quantitative importance of labor market event risk. The second chapter studies <b>investor</b> <b>redemption</b> behavior from money market mutual funds in September 2008. These funds are a popular alternative to bank accounts for cash investments, particularly for large corporations and institutional investors. Like banks, MMF investments have a liquidity mismatch between assets and liabilities that can create the potential for a run. There is an active debate about the mechanisms generating run-like behavior, particularly about the importance of strategic complementarities [...] investors' self-fulfilling beliefs about other investors' actions (i. e. "panic"). Data from the money market provide empirical evidence of the quantitative importance of complementarities in the data. Another area of asset pricing where time-varying distributions becomes important is option pricing. The third chapter studies the relationship between the option-implied distribution of market returns and estimates of the distribution obtained from time series methods. The ratio of the two densities, the pricing kernel, provides "model-free" insights about preferences. Standard models predict that the pricing kernel should be a monotonically decreasing function of the market return, but many estimates violate this property. We develop a formal, nonparametric test of pricing kernel monotonicity, provide general conditions under which the test is applicable, then perform the test using S&P 500 options data. We frequently reject the hypothesis of monotonicit...|$|R
40|$|Unlike {{textbook}} arbitrageurs who instantaneously trade {{when prices}} deviate from fundamental values, real world arbitrageurs must overcome various frictions. For example, they often invest other people’s money, {{resulting in a}} principal/agent problem that is exacerbated in market downturns. Rather than increasing investment levels when prices dip below fundamental values, arbitrageurs may, {{in the face of}} capital constraints, sell cheap securities causing prices to decline further. As a result, mispricings can be large and can extend for long periods of time. We first study the convertible bond market in 2005 when convertible hedge funds faced large redemptions of capital from <b>investors.</b> These <b>redemptions</b> led to binding capital constraints for many funds, resulting in massive bond sales and, in many cases, fund liquidations. These sales reduced prices of convertibles relative to fundamental values, especially around redemption dates. While the group of multistrategy hedge funds that were not capital constrained increased their overall position, about half of these hedge funds actually acted as net sellers, consistent with the view that information barriers within a firm (not just relative to outside investors) can lead to capital constraints for trading desks with mark-to-market losses. We document similar patterns in the convertible bond market around the collapse of Long Term Capital Management (LTCM) in 1998. When LTCM incurred large losses on macroeconomic bets, the firm was forced to liquidate large convertible bond positions. These sales led to depressed valuations of convertible bonds...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{recognized}} {{that for the}} producing companies hedging the commodity price using financial products like forwards or futures has become {{an important part of}} the company's production process. But apart from the direct impacts of hedging on the production and hedging costs the use of financial products affects the financing of the company: hedging the volatile commodity prices leads to a reduction of the risk premium the company has to pay for its debt capital, since hedging contributes to more confidence of the <b>investors</b> in the <b>redemption</b> of the debt. In this paper we therefore analyze this dependency of hedging and financing and derive optimal hedging extents for companies in different market situations based on a long-term model. By hedging the commodity price, companies can realize a surplus in profits. Thereby, the optimal hedging extent for a monopolist is often up to 100 %, whereas for companies in a polypolistic market the optimum is always less than 100 %. These results are illustrated by examples for a producing company...|$|R
40|$|Ponzi schemes {{lay their}} {{foundation}} on fraud. Once the con is exposed, the culprits are usually {{stripped of their}} pilfered millions and sent off to jail. Unfortunately for the victims, the process of recovering any portion of the money they lost in the scam is, to put it mildly, complicated. The challenge rests, in part, in differences between federal forfeiture statutes and Bankruptcy Code principles in determining what assets can be recovered and who is entitled to {{a portion of the}} Ponzi pie. What is a Ponzi scheme (as defined by the courts rather than the media) ? The Second Circuit defines a Ponzi scheme as a “fraudulent investment scheme in which money contributed by later investors is used to pay artificially high dividends to the original investors, creating an illusion of profitability, thus attracting new investors. ” The Ninth Circuit has embraced an arguably broader description: “any sort of fraudulent arrangement that uses later acquired funds or products to pay off previous investors. ” Other courts add that the scheme did not “conduct legitimate business as represented to investors. ” In essence, a Ponzi scheme is a “money in, money out” con game. After the scheme collapses, as it inevitably does, Ponzi investors fall into two broad categories. The first is the “net losers” – investors who failed to receive a full return, or in many cases any return, on their principal investment, because their contributions were used to satisfy other investors’ expectations. The other broad category is “net winners” – “lucky” <b>investors</b> who received <b>redemption</b> payments that exceed the value of their principal investments. Recoupment of fictitious profits may subject the net winners to disgorgement of those profits and, in some instances, even disgorgement of principal (although this largely applies only to net winners). Beyond these broad categories, there often are “feeder funds” – various hedge funds, brokerage houses, and banks that steered large pools of investors into the Ponzi scheme. Relationships with feeder funds enable the Ponzi schemer to sustain the scam {{over a longer period of}} time by sweeping in thousands of smaller investors. These victims may find two areas of law interacting to determine recovery and distribution of the Ponzi scheme assets. Cite as 42 Golden Gate U. L. Rev 587 (2012) ...|$|R
