5|$|Steel {{cylinders}} {{are more}} susceptible than aluminium to external corrosion, particularly in seawater, and may be galvanized or coated with corrosion barrier paints to resist corrosion damage. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> monitor external corrosion, and repair the paint when damaged, and steel cylinders which are well maintained have a long service life, often longer than aluminium cylinders, as they are not susceptible to fatigue damage when filled within their safe working pressure limits.|$|E

25|$|The Wnt {{signaling}} pathways {{are critical}} in cell-cell signaling during normal development and embryogenesis and required for maintenance of adult tissue, therefore it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> understand why disruption in Wnt signaling pathways can promote human degenerative disease and cancer.|$|E

25|$|The manor {{consisted}} of 10 messuages, 5 cottages, 10 gardens, 10 orchards, 500a. land, 50a meadow, 100a. pasture, 10a. wood, 100a. furze and heath, 50a. moor, 10a. water, 6s.4d. rent, turbary, fishing, etc. in Sierston and Flintham. Because William Fillingham had himself surveyed the estate {{as early as}} 1775 and had arranged to have estimates made of the improved value of Syerston if enclosed, with costs of enclosure, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> guess his next move.|$|E

25|$|Every Heyting algebra is {{isomorphic}} {{to one of}} {{the form}} H'T. To see this, let H be any Heyting algebra, and let 〈a'i: i∈I〉 be a family of elements generating H (for example, any surjective family). Now consider the set T of formulas J(〈A'i〉) in the variables 〈A'i: i∈I〉 such that J(〈a'i〉)=1. Then we obtain a morphism f:H'T→H by the universal property of H'T, which is clearly surjective.

Some well-known proxy servers have also been blocked. Some Chinese citizens used the Google mirror elgooG after China blocked Google.|$|E
25|$|As a rule it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> {{guess which}} eyes are {{which in a}} living or {{preserved}} specimen, but sometimes it can be. Apart {{from the fact that}} in some species one or more pairs may be missing, sometimes eyes from the posterior and anterior rows may be very close to each other, or even fused. Also, either one row or both might be so grossly curved that some of the notionally anterior eyes actually may lie posterior to some of the eyes in the posterior row. In some species the curve is so gross that the eyes apparently are arranged into two anteroposterior parallel rows of eyes.|$|E

500|$|It {{has been}} said that this {{argument}} [...] "suffers from two fatal flaws". There {{is no evidence that the}} constitutionality of the existing rules of defamation was considered by either the Malaysian or Singapore Parliaments. More significantly, even if the Governments of Malaysia and Singapore had believed these rules to be constitutional, this should not have been treated by the Court of Appeal as decisive as it is the courts' duty to independently determine whether the assumption is justified. Otherwise, a similar argument might be extended to all legislation passed by Parliament, and [...] "t <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> see that this would spell the end of constitutional law itself".|$|E
500|$|Aronson {{said the}} {{storytelling}} and action needed [...] "clarity". Leigh Dragoon from Sequential Tart described Buso Renkin as [...] "derivative" [...] and [...] "hackneyed", {{and called the}} characters [...] "completely forgettable". Conversely, Patti Martinson writing for the same site said that they [...] "are distinctive and interesting". Martinson noted [...] "the complexity of the plot", though she said it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> follow. She added there was [...] "a lot of strong material" [...] that can be developed throughout the series. Holly Ellingwood praised the final volume, stating that Watsuki did [...] "a fabulous job of covering all fronts and the various characters, juggling them effectively" [...] and that it ends [...] "in an amazing way".|$|E
500|$|Rowling {{particularly}} dislikes the British tabloid the Daily Mail, {{which has}} conducted interviews with her estranged ex-husband.

Some have speculated that Rowling's fraught relationship with the press was the inspiration behind the character Rita Skeeter, a gossipy celebrity journalist who first appears in Goblet of Fire, but Rowling noted in 2000 that the character predates her rise to fame.|$|E

In May 2013, contestant Olympe sang the {{song on the}} second season of French version of , allowing him to reach the show's semi-finale. His coach, Jenifer, welcomed the performance warmly. Jérôme Vermelin from Metronews.fr said [...] "Without piano, but in a spectacular setting, the young singer from Amiens shows his pitched voice with disconcerting facility. And his look? The mixture of great and pure sincerity? Although the formula may seem repetitive, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>difficult</b> <b>to</b> be captivated". Hanane Abdelouahed from TF1 commented that with the rendition, he [...] "has taken the track from the queen of pop".

500|$|Hopes {{for a new}} {{departure}} {{were evident}} in the Daily Telegraphs review of The Yeomen of the Guard (1888), Sullivan's most serious opera to that point: [...] "he music follows the book to a higher plane, {{and we have a}} genuine English opera, forerunner of many others, let us hope, and possibly significant of an advance towards a national lyric stage." [...] Sullivan's only wholly serious opera, Ivanhoe (1891), received generally favourable reviews, although J. A.
