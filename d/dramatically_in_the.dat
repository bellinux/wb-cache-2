5|$|The {{original}} graphic {{novel by}} Moore and Lloyd was re-released as a hardback collection in October 2005 to tie into the film's original release date of November 5, 2005. The film {{renewed interest in}} Alan Moore's original story, and sales of the original graphic novel rose <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> United States.|$|E
5|$|A new {{main drain}} to Wiggenhall St Germans was {{completed}} in 1848, which provided better drainage because the outfall was lower than that at Salters Lode. Whittlesey Mere, the last remaining lake, was drained soon afterwards, {{using one of the}} first applications of John Appold's centrifugal pump, following its appearance at the Great Exhibition in 1851. Traffic on the network began to diminish after the opening of the railway through March in 1846, and fell <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early twentieth century. The last regular commercial traffic was the tanker barge Shellfen, which delivered fuel oil to pumping stations until 1971.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} {{advocate}} for the many thousands of returned servicemen and women many ex-services organisations sprang up. The most prominent of these was probably the Returned Sailors and Soldiers Imperial League of Australia which had been established in 1916 by representatives from many state-based organisations already in existence. Following the war this organisation grew in its political influence as its numbers grew and was very active in the repatriation process, advocating for financial entitlements for veterans and securing concessions for soldiers returning to civilian employment. By 1919 it was estimated to have 150,000 members although this fell <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mid-1920s.|$|E

5|$|The {{eccentricity}} {{of their}} orbits causes regular flexing {{of the three}} moons' shapes, with Jupiter's gravity stretching them out as they approach it and allowing them to spring back to more spherical shapes as they swing away. This tidal flexing heats the moons' interiors by friction. This is seen most <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> extraordinary volcanic activity of innermost Io (which {{is subject to the}} strongest tidal forces), and to a lesser degree in the geological youth of Europa's surface (indicating recent resurfacing of the moon's exterior).|$|E
5|$|The killer whale's intelligence, trainability, {{striking}} appearance, playfulness {{in captivity}} and sheer size {{have made it}} a popular exhibit at aquaria and aquatic theme parks. From 1976 to 1997, 55 whales {{were taken from the}} wild in Iceland, 19 from Japan, and three from Argentina. These figures exclude animals that died during capture. Live captures fell <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1990s, and by 1999, about 40% of the 48 animals on display in the world were captive-born.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} people using {{antiretroviral}} therapy in Malawi has increased <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past decade: between 2004 and 2011, an estimated 300,000 people gained access to antiretroviral treatment. In addition to improving access to antiretroviral therapy, in 2008, Malawi introduced the World Health Organization's treatment guidelines for antiretroviral therapy, which improved the quality of treatment available to Malawians. However, Malawi's proposal for a new antiretroviral treatment plan in 2011, which would have cost $105 million per year, {{was rejected by the}} Global Fund, threatening Malawi's ability to continue expanding access to antiretroviral treatment.|$|E

5|$|This changed <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 2000s (decade), {{when the}} University started a {{campaign}} to {{increase the size of}} the endowment. At the close of fiscal year 2004â€“2005, the endowment had risen to $1.325 billion, raising the University to sixth of the 11 Big Ten schools in terms of endowment; within $2 million of the fifth-rated school. The rapid increase {{in the size of the}} endowment will help to improve outdated facilities, such as the Music Building, which the College of Music hopes to soon replace with money from its alumni fundraising program.|$|E
5|$|Two {{artists that}} changed the comics {{industry}} <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> late 1960s were Neal Adams, considered one of his country's greatest draftsmen, and Jim Steranko. Both artists expressed a cinematic approach at times that occasionally altered the more conventional panel-based format that had been commonplace for decades. Adams' breakthrough was based on layout and rendering. Best known for returning Batman to his somber roots after the campy success of the Batman television show, his naturalistic depictions of anatomy, faces, and gestures changed comics' style {{in a way that}} Strausbaugh sees reflected in modern graphic novels.|$|E
5|$|Unlike {{southern}} cities at the time, Chicago did not segregate {{most public}} accommodations. According to Walter Francis White of the NAACP, pre-1915 Chicago {{had a good}} reputation for equitable treatment of African Americans. However, unofficially, early 20th-century Chicago beaches were racially segregated. African Americans {{had a long history}} in Chicago, the city sending its first African-American representative to the state legislature in 1876. However, the black population in 1900 was only about 1 percent, while it expanded <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early years of the century. Most Irish Americans and African Americans competed for low-end jobs, causing tension between the groups.|$|E

25|$|After 1980, the {{historic}} tensions between evangelical Protestants and Catholics faded <b>dramatically.</b> <b>In</b> politics <b>the</b> two often joined together in conservative {{social and cultural}} issues, such as opposition to gay marriage. <b>In</b> 2000, <b>the</b> Republican coalition included almost half of Catholics and {{a large majority of}} white evangelicals.|$|R
5|$|With {{improvements}} in communications by rail and via the port, {{the population of}} Odense grew <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early 20th century. The 1901 census recorded 40,138 people, growing to 47,224 in 1911, 61,969 in 1921 and 87,090 in 1935. During the Second World War, the population passed the 100,000 mark, reaching 103,107 in 1945. It continued {{to grow in the}} post war years, with 120,570 recorded in 1955 and 133,384 in 1965; the city reached a population of 139,490 people in 1970, {{a time when it was}} developing as a university city after Odense University was established in 1966.|$|E
5|$|According to Russian {{psychiatrist}} Emmanuil Gushansky, {{the scale}} of psychiatric abuses in the past, the use of psychiatric doctrines by the totalitarian state have been thoroughly concealed. The archives of the Soviet Ministries of Internal Affairs (MVD) and Health (USSR Health Ministry), and of the Serbsky Institute for Forensic Psychiatry, which between them hold evidence about the expansion of psychiatry and the regulations governing that expansion, remain totally closed to researchers, says Gushansky. Dan Healey shares his opinion that the abuses of Soviet psychiatry under Stalin and, even more <b>dramatically,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1960s to 1980s remain under-researched: {{the contents of the}} main archives are still classified and inaccessible. Hundreds of files on people who underwent forensic psychiatric examinations at the Serbsky Institute during Stalin's time are on the shelves of the highly classified archive in its basement where Gluzman saw them in 1989. All are marked by numbers without names or surnames, and any biographical data they contain is unresearched and inaccessible to researchers.|$|E
5|$|Although much reduced, a {{significant}} Maya presence remained into the Postclassic period after {{the abandonment of}} the major Classic period cities; the population was particularly concentrated near permanent water sources. Unlike during previous cycles of contraction in the Maya region, abandoned lands were not quickly resettled in the Postclassic. Activity shifted to the northern lowlands and the Maya Highlands; this may have involved migration from the southern lowlands, because many Postclassic Maya groups had migration myths. Chichen Itza and its Puuc neighbours declined <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 11th century, and this may represent the final episode of Classic Period collapse. After the decline of Chichen Itza, the Maya region lacked a dominant power until {{the rise of the}} city of Mayapan in the 12th century. New cities arose near the Caribbean and Gulf coasts, and new trade networks were formed.|$|E
25|$|This {{period was}} <b>dramatically</b> {{documented}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1980s documentary Improper Conduct, Reinaldo Arenas in his 1992 autobiography, Before Night Falls, {{as well as}} in his fiction, most notably The Color of Summer and Farewell to the Sea.|$|R

5|$|Contract {{pollination}} has overtaken {{the role}} of honey production for beekeepers in many countries. From 1972 to 2006, feral honey bees declined <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> US, and they are now almost absent. The number of colonies kept by beekeepers declined slightly, through urbanization, systematic pesticide use, tracheal and Varroa mites, and the closure of beekeeping businesses. In 2006 and 2007 the rate of attrition increased, and was described as colony collapse disorder. In 2010 invertebrate iridescent virus and the fungus Nosema ceranae were shown to be in every killed colony, and deadly in combination. Winter losses increased to about 1/3. Varroa mites {{were thought to be}} responsible for about half the losses.|$|E
5|$|Soon, blue whales {{were being}} hunted off Iceland (1883), the Faroe Islands (1894), Newfoundland (1898), and Spitsbergen (1903). In 1904â€“05 the first blue whales were taken off South Georgia. By 1925, {{with the advent}} of the stern slipway in factory ships and the use of steam-driven whale catchers, the catch of blue whales, and baleen whales as a whole, in the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic began to {{increase}} <b>dramatically.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> 1930â€“31 season, these ships caught 29,400 blue whales in the Antarctic alone. By the end of World War II, populations had been significantly depleted, and, in 1946, the first quotas restricting international trade in whales were introduced, but they were ineffective because of the lack of differentiation between species. Rare species could be hunted on an equal footing with those found in relative abundance.|$|E
5|$|The {{capabilities}} of the HV increased <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{first few months of}} 1992 because it acquired large stockpiles of JNA's weapons in the Battle of the Barracks. After the JNA disengaged in Croatia, its personnel prepared to set up a new Bosnian Serb army, later renamed the Army of Republika Srpska (VRS). The move followed the Bosnian Serb declaration of the Serbian Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina on 9 January 1992, ahead of the 29 February1 March 1992 referendum on Bosnia and Herzegovina's independence. The referendum would later be cited as a pretext for the Bosnian War, which commenced in early April 1992, when the VRS's artillery began shelling Sarajevo. The JNA and the VRS in Bosnia and Herzegovina were confronted by the Army of the Republic of Bosnia and Herzegovina and the Croatian Defence Council (HVO), reporting to the Bosniak-dominated central government and the Bosnian Croat leadership respectively. The HV sometimes deployed to Bosnia and Herzegovina to support the HVO.|$|E

5|$|The {{growth of}} {{industry}} attracted people {{from within the}} borders of the United States, and from Latin America. By the late 19th century, African Americans were well represented in Youngstown, and the first local congregation of the African Methodist Episcopal Church was established in 1871. In the 1880s, local attorney William R. Stewart was the second African American elected to the Ohio House of Representatives. A large influx of African Americans in the early 20th century owed much to developments in the industrial sector. During the national Steel Strike of 1919, local industrialists recruited thousands of workers from the South, many of whom were Black. This move inflamed racist sentiment among local Whites, and for decades, African-American steelworkers experienced discrimination in the workplace. Migration from the South rose <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1940s, when the mechanization of southern agriculture brought an end to the exploitative sharecropping system, leading onetime farm laborers to seek industrial jobs.|$|E
5|$|The hippo {{population}} declined most <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Republic of the Congo. By 2005, {{the population}} in Virunga National Park had dropped to 800 or 900 from around 29,000 in the mid-1970s. The decline is attributed to the disruptions caused by the Second Congo War. The poachers {{are believed to be}} Mai-Mai rebels, poorly paid Congolese soldiers, and local militia groups. Reasons for poaching include the belief that hippos are harmful to society, as well as financial gain. However, as of 2016, the Virunga hippo population appears to have increased, possibly due to greater enforcement and cooperation between fishermen and park authorities. The sale of hippo meat is illegal, but black-market sales are difficult for Virunga National Park officers to track. Hippo meat is considered a delicacy in some areas of central Africa and the teeth have become a valued substitute for elephant ivory.|$|E
5|$|Like many Moroccan cities, Marrakesh {{comprises}} an old fortified city {{packed with}} vendors and their stalls (the medina), bordered by modern neighbourhoods, {{the most prominent}} of which is Gueliz. Today {{it is one of the}} busiest cities in Africa and serves as a major economic centre and tourist destination. Tourism is strongly advocated by the reigning Moroccan monarch, Mohammed VI, with the goal of doubling the number of tourists visiting Morocco to 20 million by 2020. Despite the economic recession, real estate and hotel development in Marrakesh has grown <b>dramatically</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 21st century. Marrakesh is particularly popular with the French, and numerous French celebrities own property in the city. Marrakesh has the largest traditional market (souk) in Morocco, with some 18 souks selling wares ranging from traditional Berber carpets to modern consumer electronics. Crafts employ a significant percentage of the population, who primarily sell their products to tourists. Marrakesh is one of North Africaâ€™s largest centres of wildlife trade, despite the illegality of much of this trade. Much of this trade can be found in the medina and adjacent squares. Tortoises are particularly popular for sale as pets but Barbary macaques and snakes can also be seen.|$|E
