The Glacier originates in the Brady Icefield {{to the east of}} Fairweather Range. The glacier has a width of about [...] at the water face. Its rises to height of [...] with [...] depth of [...] at the waterline. It stretches to over [...] The ice flow rate from the glacier is estimated at [...] per year and is noted to be receding in the central and eastern part of the ice face due to calving; the western part is, however, seen mostly grounded except during the high tide range. In the central part, a subglacial stream has developed which is seen to shift its position laterally. This phenomenon is attributed to the deposition of <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediment</b> in the embayment. It forms a delta, as observed during low tide. It also results in water turning from brown to tan milky.|$|E

40|$|At Aberdaron, north Wales, {{a complex}} {{sequence}} of homogeneous tills and <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments</b> overlie a hard rock base. The lower diamicton association {{at the bottom}} of the sequence consists of deformed tills and lenses of stratified sediments. It is suggested that these represent deforming bed tills and subglacial fluvial units which have been deformed together by subglacial excavational deformation. The central part of the section is marked by undeformed <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments</b> along an unconformity which has been folded in places into a series of antiforms. It is suggested that the <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments</b> were deposited by subglacial fluvial processes, and these three forms represent: i) canal features associated with “steady state” deforming bed conditions and a braided channel network; ii) channel features and iii) R-channels associated with rigid bed conditions. It is further suggested that this fluvial event was followed by a drumlinising event associated with fast ice flow (subglacial deforming bed erosion) ...|$|R

40|$|Granulometric {{analysis}} of Aeolian and <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments</b> in a middle-latitude desert basin (Ejina) was conducted. Sediments {{were collected from}} four main geomorphological units (Gobi/foredune, interdune, dune crest and riverbed) which represent the typical surficial conditions. Dunes studied are relatively coarser and lie towards the worse-sorted end of the range in comparison with other deserts. Both the M-z values of aeolian and <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments</b> tend to decrease as the distance increase toward the Langxin-shan but in different variational patterns for sorting parameters between them, indicating a regular change of grain size but different sorting processes in the regional scale between Aeolian and <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments.</b> Dune sands become finer and better sorted and less positively skewed from dune crest to interdune and foredune. This sorting pattern in dune unit appears to follow those described from the Libya and Namib deserts. While, the Ejina dunefield is located close to its sand sources, which {{for the most part}} are believed in this study to be distal palaeo-alluvial fan deposits (Gobi sediments) rather than modern <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments.</b> The Ejina dunes therefore contain significant amounts of coarse grains with weak sorting degree. This is unlike so-called "mature" sand seas (e. g., central Namib Sand Sea), which lie at some distance in time and space from the original sources of sediment, indicating that the availability of particle sizes in source area exerts a strong influence on the spatial patterns of particle size and sorting in the Ejina dunes.

40|$|Grain-size {{distribution}} {{is a fundamental}} tool for interpreting sedimentary units within depositional systems. The techniques assessed {{in this study are}} commonly used to determine grain-size distributions for sand-dominated sediments. However, the degree of consistency and differences in interpretation when using a combination of grain-size methods have not yet been assessed systematically for sand-dominated <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments.</b> Results obtained from laser diffraction, X-ray attenuation and scanning electron microscopy grain-size analysis techniques were compared with those obtained from the traditional sieve/hydrometer method. Scanning electron microscopy was shown to provide an inaccurate quantitative analysis of grain-size distributions because of difficulties in obtaining representative samples for examination. The X-ray attenuation method is unsuitable for sand-dominated sediments because of its upper size range of only 300 μm. The consistently strong correlation between the laser diffraction results and the sieve/hydrometer results shows that these methods are comparable for sand-dominated <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments.</b> Provided that sample preparation is consistent, the latter two methods can be used together within a study of such sediments while maintaining a high degree of accuracy. These results indicate that data for sand-dominated <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments</b> gained from the long-established sieve/hydrometer method can be compared with confidence to those obtained by modern studies using laser diffraction techniques...|$|R

50|$|An {{example of}} this {{condition}} is deforestation combined with agricultural land conversion, this increases the <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediment</b> flux to a new and higher dynamic steady state because soils are now disturbed by plowing and thus more vulnerable to erosion.

50|$|The {{suspended}} load {{is one of}} the three layers of the <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediment</b> transportation system.

50|$|The Schwienau is a left {{tributary}} of the Gerdau in North Germany and is 19 km long. It rises in the Weidebruch north of Brockhöfe near Wriedel and discharges north of Groß Süstedt into the Gerdau. Initially it flows through near-natural grassland landscape. But after just 2.5 kilometres it has been straightened and directed past a pumping station. It has been artificially straightened throughout much of its route and rarely flows in its natural channel. The banks either side are mainly used for agriculture. Only near Wriedel and east of the village does it run through small woods and untended heath. Its <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediment</b> consists mainly of sand and mud. This affords a habitat particularly for leeches, snails and shrimp-like animals called scuds. Its water is generally only moderately contaminated.|$|E
50|$|During the Silurian Period {{most of the}} Australian {{continent}} in {{the west}} and centre was dry land. However, from Geraldton north to Exmouth Gulf along the far Western Australian coast a <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediment</b> basin existed. Near Kalbarri on the Murchison River the footprints of a giant water scorpion were found on land, the first animal to walk on the Australian continent. A gulf linked to the sea existed under what is now the Great Sandy Desert. Meanwhile, in the east there were volcanic arcs in New England, also west of Townsville and Cairns, and in NSW and Victoria and the Australian Capital Territory. Deep water sediments formed in the Cowra, Tumut and Hillend Troughs. The Yass Molong rise was a row of volcanoes. Granite intrusions formed in New South Wales and Victoria from 435 to 425 Mya, with the Bega batholith as young as 400 Mya. In NSW granites the distinction between I-type and S-type granites was discovered.|$|E
50|$|Southern Satakunta {{near the}} shores of the Bothnian Sea hosts some Jotnian sediments known as Satakunta sandstone. This sediments are arkosic {{sandstones}} of red colour and clear stratification that are intercalated with lesser amounts of red or black shale. According to the sediments mineralogical as well as geochemical characteristics they are classified as immature. The Satakunda sandstones is a <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediment</b> formation. Based on the finding of glauconite in the Jotnian rocks of the northwestern part of the outcrop, {{it has been suggested that}} at least in that place the diagenesis occurred under water. It is found in a northwest-southeast trending graben structure that has helped to preserve the sediments. This graben has seen a downward displacement of about 650 metres. The Satakunta sandstone is not younger than 1400-1300 million years. The Satakunta sedimentary pile is at least 600 metres thick but might likely be as thick as much as 1800 metres. 1270-1250 million years old Postjotnian olivine-bearing diabase dykes cuts through the Satakunta Sandstones.|$|E
50|$|However, later {{studies of}} the fluvial {{deposits}} of the Pearl Formation and Illinoian glacial tills of the Glasford Formation, which fill an ancient and buried Mississippi River valley in north-central Illinois, demonstrated that the Illinoian Stage in its type area consists of glaciations that occurred only during Marine Isotope Stage 6. The age of proglacial <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments</b> underlying the oldest known glacial till (Kellerville Member) of the Glasford Formation yield optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dates that averaged 160,000 BP. The oldest <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments,</b> which overlay bedrock in the deepest part of the valley, were dated by OSL dating to around 190,000 BP. These OSL dates demonstrate that the Illinoian Stage is temporarily equivalent only to Marine Isotope Stage 6, which ended at 130,000 BP and started at 191,000 BP. If the Illinoian Stage is limited in duration to Marine Isotope Stage 6, the Yarmouth Soil (paleosol) spans a period of geologic time equivalent to Marine Isotope stages 7, 8, 9, 10, and 11.|$|R

40|$|The unique Middle and Late Pleistocene {{sedimentary}} record preserved {{along the}} Sussex/Hampshire Coastal Corridor between Romsey and Brighton contains {{a wealth of}} deposits including highstand marine sediments associated {{with a variety of}} different aged beaches, <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments</b> associated with rivers crossing the coastal plain and cold stage deposits accumulating above the marine and <b>fluvial</b> <b>sediments.</b> Although quarrying activity has been extensive across much of the area it has been undertaken in flooded workings due to the high level of the watertable. Consequently little is known in detail about the sequences except where they outcrop on the foreshore around the coast. This paper examines recent work from the lower coastal plain using a multi-disciplinary approach these deposits to elucidate the age of the sequences and their associated environments of deposition. OSL dates from two of the beaches, the Aldingbourne and Brighton/Norton Beaches, place both within MIS 7. Although these OSL dates cannot differentiate between sub-stages within MIS 7, coupling these results with inferences from local geography, lithology and contained microfossils {{it is clear that the}} beaches belong to two different phases within MIS 7. These two beaches are clearly divided by a major phase of erosion and downcutting associated with a fall in sea-level. <b>Fluvial</b> <b>sediments</b> from Solent Terrace 2 and Arun Terrace 4 also date within MIS 7 and are tentatively ascribed to the downcutting event between the beaches. Together this information allows us to propose, for the first time, a robust independently dated framework for the lower parts of the coastal plain integrating for the first time the marine and terrestrial record...|$|R
