Postal Service Mid Hudson Sectional Center Facility, {{which is}} the {{processing}} and regional distribution center for all ZIP codes which begin with [...] "124", [...] "125", [...] "126" [...] and [...] "127", is located on Enterprise Drive in the extreme southwest corner of Town, {{within the boundaries of}} Stewart Airport. While technically located within the town of Newburgh, it is only 1/4 mile north of the boundary with the town of New Windsor. Its only access to the town of Newburgh is from Route 17K via <b>Governor</b> <b>Drive</b> immediately east of the exit 6 interchange with Interstate 84. It contains the only bulk mail postal facility within the region. It opened on May 7, 1991, in a modern newly constructed building, replacing a previous, smaller sectional center facility located in Wappingers Falls. A post office on premises offers the full range of postal services, but was open only five days a week. When the Town post office on South Plank Road was closed in July 2012, the Stewart facility began opening from 9 a.m. until 1 p.m. on Saturdays. Post office boxes are available and accessible 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The ZIP code for post office boxes at this facility is 12552. The ZIP code 12555 is prominently displayed {{on the outside of the}} building and on the pillar at the entrance to the driveway, but apparently has never been actually put into use.In early 2014, the U.S. Postal Service closed the mail sorting facility at Stewart Airport. All sorting of all mail from the [...] "125" [...] zip code area is now done in Albany.|$|E
50|$|Prior to the {{construction}} of Interstate 565 in the early 1990s, <b>Governors</b> <b>Drive</b> extended further west, connecting to Slaughter Road just outside the city of Madison.

Portions of the road still exist while other portions were relocated {{to make room for the}} interstate highway. From Slaughter Road to the east, <b>Governors</b> <b>Drive</b> took on the name Madison Boulevard. A two lane road connecting Madison Boulevard to Old Madison Pike was created as a service road and took on the name Governors West.

The route then traveled along the old <b>Governors</b> <b>Drive</b> path past the Space and Rocket Center until it terminated with two lanes exiting {{at what is}} now the <b>Governors</b> <b>Drive</b> exit. This bypass through Madison allowed construction of the bridges over Zeirdt Road and the earthwork to be done near {{what is now the}} golf driving range and for construction of the Wall Triana exit and airport exit. The eastern terminus at <b>Governors</b> <b>drive</b> was to allow for construction of the elevated sections crossing Memorial Parkway and extending over Pratt and Oakwood to the terminus at US-72.|$|R
