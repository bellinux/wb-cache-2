[...] Following bad press resulting from his remarks, Bennett clarified his position, writing: [...] "There is simply no excuse for terrorism and the murder of the nearly 3,000 innocent victims of the 9/11 attacks on our country. My life experiences, ranging from the Battle of the Bulge to marching with Martin Luther King, made me a life-long humanist and pacifist, and reinforced my belief that violence begets violence and that war is the lowest form of human behavior." ...|$|E
500|$|More than 20 nations (most {{notably the}} United Kingdom), {{designated}} the [...] "coalition of the willing" [...] joined the United States in <b>invading</b> <b>Iraq.</b> They launched the invasion on March 20, 2003. The Iraqi military was quickly defeated. The capital, Baghdad, fell on April 9, 2003. On May 1, Bush declared {{the end of}} major combat operations in Iraq. The initial success of U.S. operations increased his popularity, but the U.S. and allied forces faced a growing insurgency led by sectarian groups; Bush's [...] "Mission Accomplished" [...] speech was later criticized as premature. From 2004 until 2007, the situation in Iraq deteriorated further, with some observers arguing {{that there was a}} full-scale civil war in Iraq. Bush's policies met with criticism, including demands domestically to set a timetable to withdraw troops from Iraq. The 2006 report of the bipartisan Iraq Study Group, led by James Baker, concluded that the situation in Iraq was [...] "grave and deteriorating". While Bush admitted that there were strategic mistakes made in regards to the stability of Iraq, he maintained he would not change the overall Iraq strategy. According to Iraq Body Count, some 251,000 Iraqis {{have been killed in the}} civil war following the U.S.-led invasion, including at least 163,841 civilians.|$|E

2500|$|Despite the Bush administration's stated {{interest}} in liberating Iraq, little formal movement towards an invasion occurred until the September 11 attacks.

Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld dismissed National Security Agency (NSA) intercept data available by midday of the 11th that pointed to al-Qaeda's culpability, and by mid-afternoon ordered the Pentagon to prepare plans for attacking Iraq. According to aides who were {{with him in the}} National Military Command Center on that day, Rumsfeld asked for: [...] "best info fast. Judge whether good enough hit Saddam Hussein at same time.
