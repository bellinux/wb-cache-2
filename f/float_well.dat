It is shown that <b>floating</b> <b>well</b> can improve both quality factor and noise elimination by itself under 3 GHz and together with a guard ring above 3 GHz. Finally, for accurate circuit simulations, a new inductor model is developed for predicting the skin effect and eddy effect and associated quality factor and inductance.

50|$|Tule (Schoenoplectus acutus {{also called}} bulrushes) have a thin (~1 cm or 0.5 inch) diameter, rounded green stems that grows to 1 to 3 metres (3-10 ft) tall. They grow well in marshes, {{wetlands}} {{or at the}} edges of bodies of water. The tule stem has a pithy interior filled with spongy tissue packed with air cells—this makes it <b>float</b> <b>well</b> on water as well as a good insulator. Native Americans used tule for making and thatching huts, baskets, mats, boats, decoys, hats, clothing and shoes. Tule was typically cut using deer scapula saws that had rough saw like edges cut into them. Tule has to be handled with care when green to avoid breaking the stem and gains strength when it is partially dried.|$|E
50|$|Papyrus {{and reed}} rafts {{make up a}} large part of the Okavango's vegetation. During the flood season they <b>float</b> <b>well</b> above the sandy river bed with roots {{dangling}} free in the water. This gap between bed and roots is utilised as shelter by crocodiles.The plants of the Delta play an important role in providing cohesion for the sand. The banks or levees of a river normally have a high mud content and this combines with the sand in the river’s load to continuously build up the river banks. In the Delta, because of the clean waters of the Okavango, there is almost no mud and the river’s load consists almost entirely of sand. The plants capture the sand, acting as the glue and making up for the lack of mud and in the process creating further islands on which more plants can take root.|$|E

Minerals were heated in air at 5020 C for 3 h, or at 150 or 25020 C for 18 or 70 h to oxidize the mineral surfaces. The flotation response for the oxidized minerals was measured as a function of collector concentration and pH. Redox potential in the flotation slurries was measured.

50|$|Oklahoma fly tyer Dave Whitlock {{conceived}} the Dave's Hopper in the 1950s {{when he was}} dissatisfied {{with the performance of}} the Joe's Hopper pattern popularized by angler Joe Brooks in his Trout Fishing (1958). Joe's Hopper (also known as the Michigan Hopper) was created in the 1920s by a Traverse City barber and fishing guide, Art Winnie. It was essentially the only hopper pattern being tied commercially in the 1950s. Joe's Hopper has a red hackle fiber tail and traditional rooster hackle for legs. Whitlock believed its biggest faults were its tendency to twist the leader and failure to <b>float</b> <b>well</b> for long periods. Whitlock's friend Joe Brooks suggested Whitlock use the Muddler Minnow as a hopper imitation instead. This inspired Whitlock to combine the best features of both flies, particularly the spun deer hair head, into the fly known as Dave's Hopper. The fly was originally tied without the yellow grizzly hackle stem legs. Fly tyer and fishing guide Jay Buckner of Jackson, Wyoming, suggested that Whitlock add these legs to the pattern to improve its performance.|$|E
40|$|Mineral {{processing}} operations, {{in particular}} flotation, need {{substantial amount of}} water {{to carry out their}} activities. However, many of these operations are located in places where water is in short supply or economic developments are putting water supplies under pressure. Using low quality water for flotation is increasingly common in mineral processing plants around the world which has implication on performance of both valuable and gangue minerals. Therefore, understanding the effect of different ions present in water on the various flotation sub-processes in both froth and pulp zones is necessary to manage low quality water and to achieve desired separation efficiencies. Researchers have shown that copper sulfide minerals, such as, chalcocite and chalcopyrite <b>float</b> <b>well,</b> both in salty water and seawater. On the other hand, there is evidence that flotation of chalcopyrite reduces in the presence of aluminium and iron species in solution. It has also been shown that multi-valence ions such as Al 3 + and Ca 2 + are more influential on froth stability than single valence ions such as Na+. This paper reviews previous work conducted in this area and highlights the interactions and implication of using low quality water in sulfide mineral flotation...|$|E
40|$|Violarite, with {{an ideal}} formula of FeNi 2 S 4, {{is the most}} {{economically}} important member of the thiospinel group of minerals. In nature, violarite forms either by exsolution during the cooling of pentlandite ((Fe,Ni) 9 S 8; Figure 1 a) or, more commonly, by the oxidation of pentlandite in the supergene zone (Figure 1 b). Understanding the thermodynamics and kinetics {{of the formation of}} violarite in the weathering profile is important for the comprehension of weathering patterns in and around nickel deposits. The formation of violarite also has significant implications for ore processing. Supergene violarite does not <b>float</b> <b>well,</b> resulting in poor nickel recovery. However, a proportion of violarite in the nickel concentrate is required to kick-start the smelting process, as the burning of violarite is a highly exothermic reaction. Hence, the roasting of nickel sulphide ores would benefit from the ability to reproduce the natural transformation of pentlandite to violarite, while nickel recovery may be improved if it is possible to transform violarite back to pentlandite.

40|$|We {{report on}} the design of an {{n-channel}} Junction Field Effect Transistor (JFET) on fully-depleted, high-resistivity, n-type silicon substrate, which is intended to be utilized as an active device in the on-chip preamplifier of the silicon radiation detectors we are developing. Two-dimensional process and device simulations are employed to optimize the device doping profile, as well as to point out some important advantages of the proposed structure over possible alternative device designs. In particular, the proposed JFET, in which an externally-contacted, p-type well isolates the active device from the high-resistivity substrate, presents higher output-resistance values than a device directly fabricated on substrate. Moreover, it is not affected by a parasitic phenomenon resulting in gate-current increase and noise-performance degradation, which, in contrast, characterizes a device with a <b>floating</b> <b>well...</b>|$|R

The streets, alive with {{a myriad of}} stalls, vibrant patterns and bustling café’s on each corner, draw the Spanish people out into the courtyards of the city. ‘El Cine Madrid’ seeks to continue the spirit of this outdoor street culture by engaging the public with its grand, monumental entrance, its glistening, shiny exterior, the demystifying projection booths visible from outside and its forest of red columns that soar majestically through the air. The two cinemas, clad in lightweight aluminium, <b>float</b> <b>well</b> above the ground surface like aeroplanes floating on clouds. As the Spanish sun sets over the city, the cinemas illuminate, enticing passers-by to enter. For two hours, viewers are transported to another time, place and dimension where they can escape from reality, relax and be entertained. ‘El Cine Madrid’ prides itself on providing viewers with a unique experience as {{they make their way}} into the theatre. The broad, generous stairs at the front draw people in to experience the spatial qualities of the building. As you make your way up the stairs and ramp, the light begins to dim as the sloping floor of the cinema above closes in on you. Moving past the first cinema, you are drawn to a second doorway that leads you under the second cinema. As you walk through, the light increases, affording another brilliant view of Madrid.

5000|$|One {{solution}} was to have Christ and the prophets <b>floating</b> <b>well</b> above the ground, which is seen in some medieval depictions and was popular in the Renaissance and later, adopted by artists including Perugino and his pupil Raphael, whose Transfiguration in the Vatican Museums, his last painting, is undoubtedly the most important single Western painting of the subject, although very few other artists followed him in combining the scene with the next episode in Matthew. This is [...] "the first monumental representation of Christ's Transfiguration to be entirely free of the traditional iconographic context", though {{it can be said}} to retain and re-invent the traditional contrast between a mystical and still upper zone and a flurry of very human activity below.
