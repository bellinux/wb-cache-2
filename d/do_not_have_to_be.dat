5|$|Solid broaches are {{the most}} common type; they are made from one solid piece of material. For broaches that wear out quickly shell broaches are used; these broaches are similar to a solid broach, except there is a hole through the center where it mounts on an arbor. Shell broaches cost more initially, but save the cost overall if the broach must be {{replaced}} often because the pilots are on the mandrel and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reproduced with each replacement.|$|E
5|$|To {{deal with}} embrittlement, the entire target chamber was {{designed}} to be easily rolled out of the center of the building on rails to the maintenance building where it could be rebuilt. The chamber was expected to last four years, and be replaced in one month. The optical system is decoupled from the chamber, which isolates it from vibrations during operation and means that the beamlines themselves <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> realigned after chamber replacement.|$|E
5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that in some respects they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E

5|$|Alkanes and aryl alkanes may be {{chlorinated}} under {{free radical}} conditions, with UV light. However, {{the extent of}} chlorination is difficult to control: the reaction is not regioselective and often results {{in a mixture of}} various isomers with different degrees of chlorination, though this may be permissible if the products are easily separated. Aryl chlorides may be prepared by the Friedel-Crafts halogenation, using chlorine and a Lewis acid catalyst. The haloform reaction, using chlorine and sodium hydroxide, is also able to generate alkyl halides from methyl ketones, and related compounds. Chlorine adds to the multiple bonds on alkenes and alkynes as well, giving di- or tetra-chloro compounds. However, due to the expense and reactivity of chlorine, organochlorine compounds are more commonly produced by using hydrogen chloride, or with chlorinating agents such as phosphorus pentachloride (PCl5) or thionyl chloride (SOCl2). The last is very convenient in the laboratory because all side products are gaseous and <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> distilled out.|$|E

25|$|Charter {{schools are}} state funded schools which operate {{outside of the}} normal state system. They began in 2014 with 5 small schools. Charter schools <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> operate with any {{registered}} or trained teachers. Teachers <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> current practicing certificates. They <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a principal. They are allowed to benefit from profit making. They <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> follow the national curriculum. They receive approximately 3 times the level of funding per student than normal state schools. If the charter school roll drops during the year, the school keeps the extra funding, unlike normal state schools, where funding is matched to students actually attending. If a charter school fails the management/owners are allowed to keep the land and buildings and other capital assets. Charter schools have less compliance with regulations than State schools although teachers must undergo police vetting.|$|R

Such moves are also useful to get around obstructions. An area mover must stop where it captures.|$|E
25|$|As in many Oceanic languages, {{not only}} verbs but also nouns (as {{well as other}} {{syntactic}} categories) are predicative in Araki.

Also, only nouns are able to refer directly to entities of the world, and make them arguments entering into larger sentence structures.|$|E
