40|$|In {{agroforestry}} systems (AFS), quantifying {{the competition}} for light is a prerequisite toward understanding the impact of shade trees on the productivity of the under-crop. Models for homogeneous canopies and shade/full-sun approaches do not address the intra-plot heterogeneity, typical of AFS. For the first time, MAESTRA, a 3 D light absorption model, was fully parameterized in a heterogeneous 2 -canopy layers AFS. We quantified competition for photosynthetic photon flux density (Q) between shade trees (<b>Erythrine</b> poepiggiana) and coffee (Coffea arabica), with a spatial resolution from the plant to the plot (2. 7 ha) and a temporal resolution from half-hour to one full year. The predicted transmittance through the 2 -canopy layers was verified against field measurements. The goodness of fit (R- 2 > 0. 75, RRMSE < 26 %) was comparable to the predictions from 10 other studies using 3 D light models and mostly verified in one-layered systems (mean R- 2 = 0. 89 and mean RRMSE = 17 %). Maps of absorbed Q showed that despite their low density in the plot (5. 2 trees ha(- 1)), the tall Erythrina trees reduced Q available for the coffee layer by 14 % annually. Annual pruning of the oldest unproductive coffee resprouts maintained a large horizontal heterogeneity in coffee LAI, with direct impact on the Q absorption map. This management practice had a strong impact on seasonal variations of absorbed Q by the coffee canopy. We proposed also a simple approach to estimate Q absorbed yearly by the coffee plants in AFS of variable tree density, requiring only few measurements in the field. An extrapolation indicated {{that the amount of}} Q absorbed by the coffee canopy would display a negative exponential relationship (k = - 0. 34) when increasing shade tree density (from nil to 29 trees ha(- 1)). The estimated k was similar to the shade tree extinction coefficient of diffuse radiation measured with a plant canopy analyzer. We showed that the presence of shade trees tends to reverse the diurnal time course of the fraction of Q(a) when compared to a plantation in the open. Overall, MAESTRA proved to successfully unlock the question of intra-plot heterogeneity for light absorption and to provide defensible light budgets as a continuous and mapped covariable, a crucial step for many field experimentations.

40|$|Out of 1500 {{soil and}} root samples {{collected}} from 47 vegetable and 89 ornamental plants from {{different parts of}} Pakistan, a total number 50 genera and 137 species of nematodes were isolated and identified from ornamental plants and 51 genera 119 species from vegetable plants. Of the nematodes, Amplimerlinius parbati Zarina & Maqbool, 1990, Dolichorhynchus motiaii n. sp.; Merlinius indicus Zarina & Maqbool, 1995; Pratylenchus roseus n. sp; Quinisulcius quaidi Zarina & Maqbool, 1992; Tylenchorhynchus rosei Zarina & Maqbool, 1991; Tylenchorhynchus tuberosus Zarina & Maqbool 1994; Tylenchus naranensis Maqbool, Zarina & Ghazala, 1987 have been described as new species. Besides, 12 known species viz., Bitylenchus vulgaris (Upadhyay, Swarup & Sethi, 1972) Siddiqi, 1986; Dolichorhynchus phaseoli (Sethi & Swarup 1968), Mulk & Jairajpuri, 1974; Eutylenchus excretorius Ebsary & Eveleigh 1981; Hoplolaimus dubius Chaturvedi & Khera, 1979; Merlinius adakensis Bernrd, 1984; Pratylenchus agilis Thorne & Malik, 1968; P. flakkensis Seinhorst, 1968; P. flakkensis Seinhorst, 1968; P. sudanensis Loof & Yassin, 1971; Scutellonema brachyurus (Steiner, 1938) Andrassy, 1958; Tylenchorhynchus intervallatus (Tobar Jimenez, 1970) Fortuner & Luc, 1987; T. madrasensis Gupta & Uma, 1981 and Tenunemellus leptocephalus (Raski, Koshy & Sosamma, 1982) Siddiqi, 1986 have been reported and redescribed from Pakistan A total of 44 new host plants and their associated plant parasitic nematodes comprising of 37 genera and two new genera Eutylenchus and Tenunemella have been recorded from Pakistan. Among these, Meloidogyne root-knot nematode have been detected in high frequency associated with ornamental and vegetable plants. M. incognita has been recorded on Jatropha podagrica, Polianthes tuberose; M. Javanica on Lobularia maritime, Justicia adhatoda, Calendula officinalis Cossmos bipinnatus, Hibiscus rosa-sinensis, Jasminum officinale, Petunia inflate, Catharanthus roseus, Setaria verticillata and Solanum nigrum. Besides, Acalypha wilkesiana, Bougainvillea spectabilis, Citharexylum spinosum, Dracaena sp., Gerbera lanuginose, Launaea nudicaulis, Manihot esculenta, Rosa indica, Tecoma stans, Zinnia elegans and Cucumis melo ssp. Melo have been found as hosts of M. incognita and M. Javanica. Lobularia maritime is a new host record for M. javanica and onion as a host of Heterodera mothi Population dynamics of different plant parasitic nematodes associated with Acalypha wilkesiana, Dracaena sp., Jatropha podagrica and Rosa indica showed maximum population during the months January to April with rapid decline during summer months. Tylenchorhynchus annulatus was the only nematode isolated from test plants with high frequencies of Helicotylenchus dihystera, H. <b>erythrine,</b> Xiphinema basiri, Rotylenchulus reniformis, X. americanum, Hoplolaimus indicus and 2 nd stage juveniles of Meloidogyne incognita and M. javanica Different organic amendments such as datura leaf powder, neem cake, mustard cake, leaf extracts of calotropis, datura, neem leaf extracts, different nematicides viz., aldicarb, furadan and mocap, some biocontrol agents such as paecilomyces lilacinus, Verticillium chlamydosporium (VC- 10) and V. chlamydosporium (VC-P) and Verticillium sp., used alone or in combination showed effective control of M. javanica root-knot nematode with improved plant growth.
