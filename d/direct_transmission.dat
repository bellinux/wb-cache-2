5|$|Rotaviruses infect {{the young}} of {{many species of}} animals {{and they are a}} major cause of {{diarrhoea}} in wild and reared animals worldwide. As a pathogen of livestock, notably in young calves and piglets, rotaviruses cause economic loss to farmers because of costs of treatment associated with high morbidity and mortality rates. These rotaviruses are a potential reservoir for genetic exchange with human rotaviruses. There is evidence that animal rotaviruses can infect humans, either by <b>direct</b> <b>transmission</b> of the virus or by contributing one or several RNA segments to reassortants with human strains.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} ways in which viruses spread from host to host but each species of virus uses only one or two. Many viruses that infect plants are carried by organisms; such organisms are called vectors. Some viruses that infect animals, {{including}} humans, are also spread by vectors, usually blood-sucking insects. However, <b>direct</b> <b>transmission</b> is more common. Some virus infections, such as norovirus and rotavirus, are spread by contaminated food and water, hands and communal objects and by intimate contact with another infected person, while others are airborne (influenza virus). Viruses such as HIV, hepatitis B and hepatitis C are often transmitted by unprotected sex or contaminated hypodermic needles. It is important to know how each different kind of virus is spread to prevent infections and epidemics.|$|E
5|$|HIV is {{now known}} to spread between CD4+ T cells by two {{parallel}} routes: cell-free spread and cell-to-cell spread, i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms. In the cell-free spread, virus particles bud from an infected T cell, enter the blood/extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter. HIV can also disseminate by <b>direct</b> <b>transmission</b> from one cell to another by a process of cell-to-cell spread. Two pathways of cell-to-cell transmission have been reported. Firstly, an infected T cell can transmit virus directly to a target T cell via a virological synapse. Secondly, an antigen presenting cell (APC) can also transmit HIV to T cells by a process that either involves productive infection (in the case of macrophages) or capture and transfer of virions in trans (in the case of dendritic cells). Whichever pathway is used, infection by cell-to-cell transfer {{is reported to be}} much more efficient than cell-free virus spread. A number of factors contribute to this increased efficiency, including polarised virus budding towards the site of cell-to-cell contact, close apposition of cells which minimizes fluid-phase diffusion of virions, and clustering of HIV entry receptors on the target cell to the contact zone. Cell-to-cell spread is thought to be particularly important in lymphoid tissues where CD4+ T lymphocytes are densely packed and likely to frequently interact. Intravital imaging studies have supported the concept of the HIV virological synapse in vivo. The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies.|$|E
40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we develop}} two new MAC {{protocols}} for multichannel operation in wireless ad hoc and mesh networks. The first protocol, Extended Receiver <b>Directed</b> <b>Transmission</b> protocol (xRDT) {{is based on}} a previously known multichannel solution called Receiver <b>Directed</b> <b>Transmission</b> (RDT) that uses a notion of quiescent channel. xRDT solves the problems faced by RDT, such as multichannel hidden terminal and deafness, by using an additional busy tone interface and few additional protocol operations. We also develop a novel single interface solution, called Local Coordination-based Multichannel MAC (LCM MAC). LCM MAC performs coordinated channel negotiations and channel switching to provide multichannel support. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these two protocols over two other wellknown multichannel protocols – MMAC and DCA – via extensive ns 2 simulations. I...|$|R
40|$|For service {{integrated}} digital TDM telecommunication {{systems with}} different loop structures the dependency {{of the network}} availability from the network structure and the operation principle is investigated. Single and double loop networks with an undirected and <b>directed</b> <b>transmission</b> of the messages are compared in undisturbed and disturbed network operation states. It is shown that {{the application of a}} <b>directed</b> <b>transmission</b> not only keeps the network operational in a failure state but likewise improves the network availability by decreasing the total traffic load on the transmission lines. The availability is estimated either by the traffic loss or the degradation of the traffic distribution between the subscribers if no failure or one or more interrupts of the message flow arise. For the message exchange, principles of multiple access and decentralized switching are used...|$|R

5|$|Studies {{have also}} {{detected}} both EEHV1A and EEHV1B as being shed in trunk wash secretions by healthy asymptomatic Asian zoo elephant herdmates of calves that previously had disease. and similarly for EEHV5. Thus, similar to saliva for most {{human and animal}} herpesviruses, the trunk secretions may {{be a source of}} transmission for EEHVs. Because of concerns about the origins of EEHV1 and evidence of cross-species transmission for EEHV3, long-term contact between Asian and African elephants has been discouraged, along with avoiding new contacts between young captive-born Asian elephants and wild-born Asian elephants, as the latter may be carriers of the disease. An analysis of a number of North American cases, which ruled out the <b>direct</b> <b>transmission</b> of the virus between any of the affected facilities studied, strongly supported the idea of a significant Asian carrier population. This is supported by {{the fact that some of}} the deceased calves had no possible contact with any African elephants. Artificial insemination is not believed to be a transmission factor, notes that when multiple calves of a single bull or cow elephant died at different times (even at the same facility) they nearly all had distinct strains of the virus, yet when two calves died or became infected at the same time at the same facility the pairs have always had identical virus strains. A program of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay testing began in 2005, aiming to test blood samples from around a thousand elephants for antibodies to the virus in order to help identify carriers and possible transmission patterns.|$|E

25|$|We {{consider}} a wireless relay system {{that consists of}} source, relay and destination nodes.

25|$|The {{light that}} {{corresponds}} to <b>direct</b> <b>transmission</b> (or specular reflection {{in the case of}} a reflection grating) is called the zero order, and is denoted m = 0.

25|$|The {{simplest}} cooperative relaying network {{consists of}} three nodes, namely source, destination, and a third node supporting the direct communication between source and destination denoted as relay. If the <b>direct</b> <b>transmission</b> of a message from source to destination is not (fully) successful, the overheard information from the source is forwarded by the relay to reach the destination via a different path. Since the two communications took a different path and take place one after another, this example implements the concept of space diversity and time diversity.|$|E

25|$|<b>Direct</b> <b>transmission</b> of a {{swine flu}} virus from pigs to humans is {{occasionally}} possible (zoonotic swine flu). In all, 50 cases {{are known to}} have occurred since the first report in medical literature in 1958, which have resulted in a total of six deaths. Of these six people, one was pregnant, one had leukemia, one had Hodgkin's lymphoma and two were known to be previously healthy.

However, <b>direct</b> <b>transmission</b> from pigs to humans is rare, with only 12 recorded cases in the U.S. since 2005. Nevertheless, the retention of influenza strains in pigs after these strains have disappeared from the human population might make pigs a reservoir where influenza viruses could persist, later emerging to reinfect humans once human immunity to these strains has waned.|$|E
25|$|Mechanical {{transmission}} {{involves the}} <b>direct</b> <b>transmission</b> {{of the same}} individual trypanosomes taken from an infected host into an uninfected host. The name 'mechanical' reflects the similarity of this mode of transmission to mechanical injection with a syringe. Mechanical transmission requires the tsetse to feed on an infected host and acquire trypanosomes in the blood meal, and then, within a relatively short period, to feed on an uninfected host and regurgitate some of the infected blood from the first blood meal into the tissue of the uninfected animal. This type of transmission occurs most frequently when tsetse are interrupted during a blood meal and attempt to satiate themselves with another meal. Other flies, such as horse-flies, can also cause mechanical transmission of trypanosomes.|$|E

25|$|Cooperative {{diversity}} is a cooperative multiple antenna technique for improving or maximising total network channel capacities {{for any given}} set of bandwidths which exploits user diversity by decoding the combined signal of the relayed signal and the direct signal in wireless multihop networks. A conventional single hop system uses <b>direct</b> <b>transmission</b> where a receiver decodes the information only based on the direct signal while regarding the relayed signal as interference, whereas the cooperative diversity considers the other signal as contribution. That is, cooperative diversity decodes {{the information from the}} combination of two signals. Hence, {{it can be seen that}} cooperative {{diversity is}} an antenna diversity that uses distributed antennas belonging to each node in a wireless network. Note that user cooperation is another definition of cooperative diversity. User cooperation considers an additional fact that each user relays the other user's signal while cooperative diversity can be also achieved by multi-hop relay networking systems.|$|E
