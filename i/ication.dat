40|$|A {{computational}} {{system for}} the prediction and classif <b>ication</b> of human G-protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) has been developed based on the support vector ma-chine (SVM) method and protein sequence information. The feature vectors used to develop the SVM prediction models consist of statistically signif icant features selected from single amino acid, dipeptide, and tripeptide compositions of pro-tein sequences. Furthermore, the length distribution difference between GPCRs and non-GPCRs has also been exploited to improve the prediction performance. The testing results with annotated human protein sequences demonstrate that this system can get good performance for both prediction and classif <b>ication</b> of human GPCRs.

40|$|Wavelength {{dispersive}} X-Ray fluorescence analysis, {{coupled with}} multivariate statistics, {{has been used}} to characterise the alluvial soils of the easternmost Po Plain area. Coarse to fine sediments, which can be related to various depositional environments (paleochannels, interf luvial areas, brackish marsh interdistributary bays and littoral dunes), have been taken into consideration. Through the use of an extensive analytical database and the principal component analysis in combination with factorial analysis, a soil classif <b>ication</b> method is proposed, which can also help to constrain the depositional environment of the alluvial sediments. This methodology was subsequently validated using other wavelength dispersive X-Ray fluorescence analyses of soils with different provenance and historical bricks made with alluvial deposits similar to those already studied. By relating the principal component analysis in combination with factorial analysis factors, we therefore provide a useful tool to integrate the classical and well-established classif <b>ication</b> of alluvial deposits based on f ield observation and grain size investigations...|$|E
