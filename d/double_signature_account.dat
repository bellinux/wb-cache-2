40|$|When {{asked to}} change one's {{beliefs in the}} face of new information, or to revise a book given errata, we {{commonly}} strive to keep our changes relevant, that is, we try to restrict the beliefs (or chapters) we change to those that bear some content relation to the new information. One kind of relevance, topicality, is interesting for two reasons: First, topicality tends to be strongly encapsulating, e. g., we shouldn't make any off-topic changes. Second, topicality tends to be weaker than strict relevance. Consider a panel of three papers on the topic of Kant's life and works. It would be entirely possible for each of the papers to have no bearing on the truth of any sentence in any of the other papers, and yet for all of the papers to be on topic. In this dissertation, I explore theories of logical topicality and their effect on formal theories of belief revision. Formal theories of belief revision (in the Alchourrón, Gärdenfors, and Makinson (AGM) tradition) model the object of change (my beliefs, a book) as a collection of formulae in a supra-classical logic and provide a set of postulates which express constraints on the sorts of change that are, in principle, formally rational. In 1999, Rohit Parikh proposed that signature disjointness captured a reasonable notion of topicality but that taking topicality into account required changes in the standard AGM postulates (and thus, the notion of rational change). He, and subsequent theorists, abandoned this notion of topicality {{in order to deal with}} the revision of inconsistent objects of change. In this thesis, I show 1) that a disjoint <b>signature</b> <b>account</b> of topicality does not require changes to the AGM rationality postulates and 2) a disjoint <b>signature</b> <b>account</b> of topicality can apply to inconsistent objects of change. Additionally, I argue that signature disjointness has a strong claim to being at least a sufficient condition of logical topicality...|$|R

The composition was varied, 0. 30 ≤x≤ 0. 85, while the modulation period Λ was kept constant at about 10 nm.

A temperature dependent x-ray diffraction investigation shows a large shift of the paraelectric-antiferroelectric phase transition scaling with the BiFeO 3 thickness. This shift is correlated with the strain state and can be explained by a strong interplay between octahedral rotation/tilt and anti-polar Bi displacement.

40|$|Investigations of {{classical}} signature change have generally envisaged applications to cosmological models, usually a Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker model. The purpose {{has been to}} avoid the inevitable singularity of models with purely Lorentzian signature, replacing the neighbourhood of the big bang with an initial, singularity free region of Euclidean signture, and a signature change. We here show that signature change can also avoid the singularity of gravitational collapse. We investigate the process of re-birth of Schwarzschild type black holes, modelling it as a <b>double</b> <b>signature</b> change, joining two universes of Lorentzian signature through a Euclidean region which provides a `bounce'. We show that this process is viable both with and without matter present, but realistic models [...] which have the signature change surfaces hidden inside the horizons [...] require non-zero density. In fact the most realistic models are those that start as a finite cloud of collapsing matter, surrounded by vacuum. We consider how geodesics may be matched across a signature change surface, and conclude that the particle `masses' must jump in value. This scenario may be relevant to Smolin's recent proposal that a form of natural selection operates {{on the level of}} universes, which favours the type of universe we live in.

40|$|Object-Oriented Databases (OODBs) {{have gained}} wide {{attention}} {{in the past few}} decades because its greater modeling power on structurally complex data compared to relational database systems. These systems, benefited by the object-oriented approach, require also a high quality of performance on data manipula-tion. Indexing is one common technique to increase the performance of OODBs. Since most of these systems are static in nature, dynamic operations like class versioning and role-playing or intelligent operations like query relaxation and specification are not supported by traditional indexing schemes. In order to support these dynamic and intelligent query operations, a more sophisticated indexing scheme is needed. This thesis proposes the <b>double</b> <b>signature</b> indexing scheme (DSIS) for a dynamic object-oriented database programming language with role extension, called DOOR. The scheme supports retrievals of a large range of queries including class relation queries, nested queries as well as queries which only exist in dynamic environment like qualification and versioning queries. In this thesis, the types of queries supported by the indexing scheme are addressed. Besides, the index structure of the indexing scheme is described. The dynamic, intelligent as well as static operations which are supported by the indexing structure are also stated. In addition, the processes on how the new indexing mechanism handle different kinds of queries are demonstrated. The maintenance of the index structure in the dynamic environment is also presented. Finally, analytical cost models for the indexing scheme is developed and the estimated retrieval and storage cost are formulated...|$|R
40|$|Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) systems {{represent}} {{the most powerful}} tool to monitor flood events because of their all-weather capability {{that allows them to}} collect suitable images even in cloudy conditions. The quality of the flood monitoring using SAR is increasing thanks to the improved spatial resolution of the new generation of instruments and to the short revisit time of the present and future satellite constellations. To fully exploit these technological advances, the methods to interpret images and produce flood maps must be upgraded, so that an accurate interpretation of the multitemporal radar <b>signature,</b> <b>accounting</b> for system parameters (frequency, polarization, incidence angle) and land cover, becomes very important. The images collected by the COSMO-SkyMed constellation of X-band radars represent an example of the aforesaid technological advances. This paper presents a case study regarding a flood occurred in Tuscany (Central Italy) in 2009 monitored using COSMO-SkyMed data. It is shown that the interpretation of the radar data is not straightforward, especially in the presence of vegetation and should rely on the knowledge about the radar scattering mechanisms implemented into electromagnetic models. The paper discusses the multitemporal radar signatures observed during the event and describes the approach we have followed to account for the electromagnetic background into a semi-automatic data processing system...|$|R

40|$|Pattern {{recognition}} of amino acid signals partitions {{the cells of}} the goldfish retina into nine statistically unique biochemical theme classes and permits a first-order chemical mapping of virtually all cellular space. Photoreceptors, bipolar cells, and ganglion cells display a set of unique, nominally glutamatergic type El, El + E 2, and E 4 signatures, respectively. All horizontal cells are assignable to a GA-BAergic r 2 class or a non-GABAergic class with a glutamate-rich E 3 signature. The amacrine cell layer is largely a mixture of (1) a taurine-dominated Tl Miiller’s cell signature and (2) GABAergic l 7, glycinergic Gl, and dual glycinergic/GABAergic GIY amacrine cell signatures. Several major conclusions emerge from this work. (1) Glutamatergic, GABAergic, and glycinergic neural signatures and glial <b>signatures</b> <b>account</b> for over 99 % of the cellular space in the retina.

Our analysis of 2015 - 2017 data confirms the occurrence in January 2017 {{of a new}} peak fitting in the previous trend. In addition, we identify secondary peaks ("twin peaks") that occur in closely symmetric pairs {{on both sides of}} most main peaks, including the last one; their occurrence is supported by correlated X-ray outbursts. We stress that the above features strongly point to binary dynamics in a system of two black holes (BHs) of some 10 ^ 8 and 10 ^ 7 M_sun. At periastron the smaller BH periodically stresses the jet j_ 1 launched by the heavier companion, and triggers MHD-kinetic tearing instabilities. These lead to magnetic reconnections and to acceleration of electrons that produce synchrotron emission from the optical to X-ray bands, and inverse Compton scattering into the GeV range. For the origin of the twin peaks we discuss two possibilities: a single-jet model, based on added instabilities induced in j_ 1 by the smaller companion BH on its inner orbital arc; and a two-jet model with the smaller BH supporting its own, precessing jet j_ 2 that contributes lower, specific GeV emissions. Such behaviors combining time stability with amplitude variations betray plasma instabilities driven in either jet by binary dynamics, and can provide a <b>double</b> <b>signature</b> of the long-sought supermassive BH binaries.

40|$|Despite the {{existence}} of morphologically indistinguishable disease, patients with advanced ovarian tumors display {{a broad range of}} survival end points. We hypothesize that gene expression profiling can identify a prognostic <b>signature</b> <b>accounting</b> for these distinct clinical outcomes. To resolve survival-associated loci, gene expression profiling was completed for an extensive set of 185 (90 optimal/ 95 suboptimal) primary ovarian tumors using the Affymetrix human U 133 A microarray. Cox regression analysis identified probe sets associated with survival in optimally and suboptimally debulked tumor sets at a P value of 3 ̆c 0. 01. Leave-one-out cross-validation was applied to each tumor cohort and confirmed by a permutation test. External validation was conducted by applying the gene signature to a publicly available array database of expression profiles of advanced stage suboptimally debulked tumors. The prognostic signature successfully classified the tumors according to survival for suboptimally (P = 0. 0179) but not optimally debulked (P = 0. 144) patients. The suboptimal gene signature was validated using the independent set of tumors (odds ratio, 8. 75; P = 0. 0146). To elucidate signaling events amenable to therapeutic intervention in suboptimally debulked patients, pathway analysis was completed for the top 57 survival-associated probe sets. For suboptimally debulked patients, confirmation of the predictive gene signature supports {{the existence}} of a clinically relevant predictor, as well as the possibility of novel therapeutic opportunities. Ultimately, the prognostic classifier defined for suboptimally debulked tumors may aid in the classification and enhancement of patient outcome for this high-risk population...|$|R
