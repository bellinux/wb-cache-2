5|$|Miller's Language and Communication {{was one of}} {{the first}} {{significant}} texts in the study of language behavior. The book was a scientific study of language, emphasizing quantitative data, and was based on the mathematical model of Claude Shannon's <b>information</b> <b>theory.</b> It used a probabilistic model imposed on a learning-by-association scheme borrowed from behaviorism, with Miller not yet attached to a pure cognitive perspective. The first part of the book reviewed <b>information</b> <b>theory,</b> the physiology and acoustics of phonetics, speech recognition and comprehension, and statistical techniques to analyze language. The focus was more on speech generation than recognition. The second part had the psychology: idiosyncratic differences across people in language use; developmental linguistics; the structure of word associations in people; use of symbolism in language; and social aspects of language use.|$|E

5|$|The modern form of {{a binary}} logarithm, {{applying}} to any number (not just powers of two) was considered explicitly by Leonhard Euler in 1739. Euler established the application of binary logarithms to music theory, long before their more significant applications in <b>information</b> <b>theory</b> and computer science became known. As part of his work in this area, Euler published a table of binary logarithms of the integers from 1 to 8, to seven decimal digits of accuracy.|$|E
5|$|In electronics, {{magnetic}} core memory, radar, single electron transistors, and inertial guidance controls were invented or substantially developed by MIT researchers.

In the domain of computer science, MIT faculty and researchers made fundamental contributions to cybernetics, artificial intelligence, computer languages, machine learning, robotics, and cryptography.

5|$|Reviewing {{the book}}, Charles E. Osgood {{classified}} {{the book as}} a graduate-level text based more on objective facts than on theoretical constructs. He thought the book was verbose on some topics and too brief on others {{not directly related to}} the author's expertise area. He was also critical of Miller's use of simple, Skinnerian single-stage stimulus-response learning to explain human language acquisition and use. This approach, per Osgood, made it impossible to analyze the concept of meaning, and the idea of language consisting of representational signs. He did find the book objective in its emphasis on facts over theory, and depicting clearly application of <b>information</b> <b>theory</b> to psychology.|$|E

5|$|Szilard {{initially}} attended Palatine Joseph Technical University in Budapest, but his {{engineering studies}} were interrupted by {{service in the}} Austro-Hungarian Army during World War I. He left Hungary for Germany in 1919, enrolling at Technische Hochschule (Institute of Technology) in Berlin-Charlottenburg, but became bored with engineering and transferred to Friedrich Wilhelm University, where he studied physics. He wrote his doctoral thesis on Maxwell's demon, a long-standing puzzle {{in the philosophy of}} thermal and statistical physics.

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{research into}} thinking machines {{was inspired by}} a confluence of ideas that became prevalent in the late 30s, 40s and early 50s. Recent research in neurology had shown that the brain was an electrical network of neurons that fired in all-or-nothing pulses. Norbert Wiener's cybernetics described control and stability in electrical networks. Claude Shannon's <b>information</b> <b>theory</b> described digital signals (i.e., all-or-nothing signals). Alan Turing's theory of computation showed that any form of computation could be described digitally. The close relationship between these ideas suggested that {{it might be possible to}} construct an electronic brain.|$|E
5|$|The {{invention}} of electronic {{computers in the}} 1940s, along {{with the development of}} mathematical <b>information</b> <b>theory,</b> led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems. This concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics, and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience. The earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a digital computer in disguise, as for example in John von Neumann's 1958 book, The Computer and the Brain. Over the years, though, accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism.|$|E

5|$|As older {{problems}} are solved, more complexities are being introduced, like adding additional parts to an engine. Interaction {{of these new}} parts, or niches, create emergent properties, like time-saving office devices (e.g. email, mobile computers, etc.) make communication more efficient but also expand the network of contacts and {{increase the amount of}} time spent on such duties. Homer-Dixon relates this to complexity theory explaining that as new niches are filled there is a synergistic burst of simplicity. However, this can also lead to less control or freedom as emergent properties are created, like a new government program leading to a sprawling bureaucracy. <b>Information</b> <b>theory</b> is touched upon relating the amount of information required to describe a system and the degree of that system's complexity. Chaos theory is used to describe how small changes can lead to widely varying results and path dependence.|$|E
5|$|Szilard was {{appointed}} as assistant to von Laue at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1924. In 1927 {{he finished his}} habilitation and became a Privatdozent (private lecturer) in physics. For his habilitation lecture, he produced a second paper on Maxwell's Demon, Über die Entropieverminderung in einem thermodynamischen System bei Eingriffen intelligenter Wesen (On the reduction of entropy in a thermodynamic system by the intervention of intelligent beings), that had actually been written soon after the first. This introduced the thought experiment now called the Szilard engine and became important {{in the history of}} attempts to understand Maxwell's demon. The paper is also the first equation of negative entropy and information. As such, it established Szilard as {{one of the founders of}} <b>information</b> <b>theory,</b> but he did not publish it until 1929, and did not pursue it further. Claude E. Shannon, who took it up in the 1950s, acknowledged Szilard's paper as his starting point.|$|E

Thus, we not only provide a first step towards a formally verified separation kernel, but also reduce the gap between <b>information</b> flow <b>theory</b> and operating systems practice. I...|$|R
