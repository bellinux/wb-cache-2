40|$|While {{the theory}} and {{practice}} of evolutionary robotics is well established, most work to date has been concerned with evolving a robot’s control system – it’s software. This chapter is concerned instead with the more difficult problem of how to evolve robot hardware – a robot’s physical body shape (morphology) and the arrangement of sensors and actuators within that body. We focus on the problems of which aspects of a robot’s hardware can be evolved, how they might be coded in the genome and, perhaps most importantly, how (and if) the evolved robot can be physically constructed with currently available materials and processes.

40|$|Previously, we {{introduced}} Evolutionary Model Consistency Checking (EMCC) {{as an adjunct}} to <b>Evolvable</b> and Adaptive <b>Hardware</b> (EAH) methods. The core idea was to dual-purpose objective function evaluations to simultaneously enable EA search of hardware configurations while simultaneously enabling a model-based inference {{of the nature of the}} damage that necessitated the hardware adaptation. We demonstrated the efficacy of this method by modifying a pair of EAH oscillators inside a simulated Flapping-Wing Micro Air Vehicle (FW-MAV). In that work, we were able to show that one could, while online in normal service, evolve wing gait patterns that corrected altitude control errors cause by mechanical wing damage while simultaneously determining, with high precision, what the wing lift force deficits that necessitated the adaptation. In this work, we extend the method to be able to also determine wing drag force deficits. Further, we infer the now extended set of four unknown damage estimates without substantially increasing the number of objective function evaluations required. In this paper we will provide the outlines of a formal derivation of the new inference method plus experimental validation of efficacy. The paper will conclude with commentary on several practical issues, including better containment of estimation error by introducing more in-flight learning trials and why one might argue that these techniques could eventually be used on a true free-flying flapping wing vehicle...|$|R
