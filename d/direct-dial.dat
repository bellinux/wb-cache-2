50|$|Because of the overlay of 703 and 571, 10-digit dialing is {{mandatory}} even for local calls; cellphone callers {{do the same}} on all <b>direct-dialled</b> calls. Long-distance calls are dialed as eleven digits, using the prefix 1, but for landline-based phones only.|$|R
2500|$|Even {{after the}} {{assignment}} of numbers, operators still connected most calls into the early 20th century: [...] "Hello, Central. Get me Underwood-342." [...] Connecting through operators or [...] "Central" [...] was the norm until mechanical <b>direct-dialing</b> of numbers became {{more common in the}} 1920s.|$|R
50|$|The service {{provided}} voice communications between its subscribers worldwide, based on Internet standards.

50|$|Area code 201 was the first-assigned {{numbering}} plan area (NPA) {{code of the}} original NPAs when AT&T devised the North American Numbering Plan in 1947. It {{was also the first}} area code with Direct Distance Dialing (DDD) service, when in 1951 the first <b>direct-dialed</b> long-distance call was made from Englewood, New Jersey to Alameda, California.|$|R
50|$|As {{opposed to}} its predecessor, it {{featured}} <b>direct-dialing</b> (so that human operators {{were not required}} to connect calls). The frequency plan originally included only 38 channels (with one call possible per frequency channel), but it was upgraded to incorporate the A-Netz frequencies when that network was retired in 1980. The upgraded network had 78 channels and is sometimes referred to as the B2-Netz.|$|R
50|$|As {{telephone}} exchanges converted to automatic (dial) service, switchboards continued to serve specialized purposes. Before {{the advent of}} <b>direct-dialed</b> long distance calls, a subscriber would need to contact the long-distance operator in order to place a toll call. In large cities, there was often a special number, such as 112, which would ring the long-distance operator directly. Elsewhere, the subscriber would ask the local operator to ring the long-distance operator.|$|R

5000|$|In the United States and Canada, {{usage of}} manual Zenith numbers diminished after the 1967 {{introduction}} of interstate <b>direct-dial</b> 1-800 InWATS toll-free service; {{the requirement that}} +1-800 numbers arrive on special fixed-rate trunks ended in 1982. A similar service in the United Kingdom, in which callers asked operators for [...] "Freephone (name or number)", had no <b>direct-dial</b> counterpart until 1985.|$|E
50|$|The 1-1-9 in Maldives is a <b>direct-dial</b> free {{emergency}} number {{that connects the}} caller to the national police (Maldives Police Service).|$|E
50|$|Automation {{introduced}} {{pulse dialing}} between {{the telephone and}} the exchange, so that each subscriber could directly dial another subscriber connected to the same exchange, but long distance calling across multiple exchanges required manual switching by operators. Later, more sophisticated address signaling, including multi-frequency signaling methods, enabled <b>direct-dialed</b> long distance calls by subscribers, culminating in the Signalling System 7 (SS7) network that controlled calls between most exchanges {{by the end of}} the 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|In a <b>direct-dialed</b> long {{distance}} call, a call-related data and message record, named [...] "automatic message account" [...] (AMA), was generated. It includes further information, {{such as the}} originating and terminating telephone numbers, {{and the length of}} time of the call. The records with AMAs are stored in an electronic format that can be transmitted between computers and reformatted for processing and billing, which later comes to customer in form of hard copy via mails.|$|R
5000|$|In the United States and Canada, Directory Assistance was {{historically}} a local function, {{and most}} companies updated listings at their directory assistance centers almost daily. Callers would dial 4-1-1 or 1-1-3 for fast, efficient, and accurate service. When long-distance numbers were needed, {{prior to the}} full introduction of <b>direct-dialed</b> long-distance service, callers would call either 4-1-1 or [...] "0" [...] (Operator) and request a free long-distance connection to the directory assistance center in the distant city.|$|R
50|$|As <b>direct-dial</b> {{toll-free}} service {{declined in}} cost, Zenith numbers nearly disappeared; telephone companies in most service areas {{are no longer}} assigning new Zenith numbers.|$|E

50|$|Data.com {{utilizes}} a user-generated database that's {{continually updated}} by its members. Data.com's contacts {{act as a}} virtual business card, offering name, title, postal and email addresses and <b>direct-dial</b> phone numbers for individual contacts.|$|E
5000|$|AUTOVON used a {{numbering}} scheme {{similar to the}} North American Numbering Plan. The network had its own three-digit area codes for various geographic regions around the world. Each area code covered several three-digit exchange codes, usually corresponding to the central office telephone switches serving each installation. Thus, almost any telephone on a military base could be <b>direct-dialed</b> via AUTOVON. A selected set of telephones were four-wire AUTOVON phones, wired directly into the AUTOVON network. Others could initiate AUTOVON calls with operator assistance.|$|R
50|$|Some {{geographic}} area codes {{are similar to}} the toll-free codes, e.g., 801, 818, 860. Such similarities have been exploited by fraudsters in international locations that can be <b>direct-dialed</b> with what appear at first glance to be domestic area codes, including 809, 829, and 849, which are official prefixes for the Dominican Republic and 876 which is the area code for Jamaica. Toll-free numbers are also sometimes confused with 900-numbers, for which the telephone company bills the callers at rates far in excess of long-distance service rates for services such as recorded information or live chat.|$|R
50|$|In 1962, <b>direct-dialed</b> long-distance {{directory}} assistance became available. The number in cities with panel and crossbar switching equipment was area code-555-1212, whereas in cities with step-by-step equipment {{the number was}} 1-555-1212 (or 112-555-1212) for numbers not local {{but in the same}} area code and 1-area code-555-1212 (or 112-area code-555-1212) for numbers in other area codes. In some area codes, the {{directory assistance}} center was able to serve the entire area code, but in many, the operator in the principal city of the area code dialed would connect the caller onward to a more local directory assistance center for the most up-to-date information.|$|R

50|$|The first <b>direct-dialed</b> long-distance {{telephone}} calls were {{possible in the}} New Jersey communities of Englewood and Teaneck. Customers of the ENglewood 3, ENglewood 4 and TEaneck 7 exchanges, who could already dial New York City and area, were able to dial 11 cities across the United States, simply by dialing the three-digit area code and the seven-digit number, {{which at the time}} consisted of the first two letters of the central office name and five digits. On November 10, 1951, Englewood Mayor M. Leslie Denning made the first customer-dialed long distance call, to Mayor Frank Osborne of Alameda, California.|$|R
50|$|The North American Numbering Plan was devised in 1947, and has {{provided}} customer <b>direct-dialed</b> long-distance telephone service since 1951. Occasionally, {{the growing demand}} for telephone numbers has mandated certain changes in the format of telephone numbers and method by which they are allocated to telephone companies. Instead of expanding the size of telephone numbers, as implemented in many countries outside North America, the NANP was modified to allow continued use of seven-digit telephone numbers and a three-digit area code. The first modifications removed restrictions placed on the central office prefixes that existed due to the incorporation of telephone exchange names into the numbering plan. Later modifications relaxed the restrictions for the digits permitted in the area code format.|$|R

Developed by the Orlando Division of Martin Marietta Aerospace, Orlando, Florida, and manufactured by Harris Corporation's RF Division, Rochester, N. Y., HICOM upgrades service to users, provides better system management to telephone companies, and makes more efficient use of available mobile telephone channels through a computerized central control terminal. The real estate man, for example, was able to dial his office and he could also have <b>direct-dialed</b> a long distance number. Mobile phones in most areas not yet served by HICOM require an operator's assistance for both local and long distance calls. HICOM improves system management by automatically recording information on all calls for accurate billing, running continual performance checks on its own operation, and reporting any malfunctions to a central office...|$|R
