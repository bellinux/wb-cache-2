50|$|Changes in {{postal rates}} were {{published}} on 6 September 1865, this called <b>for</b> <b>new</b> <b>stamps.</b> Before 1866 stamps were solely supplied from Montevideo but in 1865 the Uruguay postal authorities ordered {{a new set}} of stamps abroad, in London at Maclure, Macdonald and Co. The set did not arrive in time and the 1864 issue had to be overprinted with the new denominations as emergency measure. The first overprinted, provisional stamp set of Uruguay was a fact.|$|E
5000|$|Twelve {{criteria}} <b>for</b> <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> and {{postal stationery}} include that [...] "events of historical significance shall {{be considered for}} commemoration only on anniversaries in multiples of 50 years." [...] For many years, these included the restriction that [...] "no postal item will be issued sooner than {{five years after the}} individual's death," [...] with an exception provided for stamps memorializing recently deceased U.S. Presidents. In September 2011, however, the postal service announced that, in an attempt to increase flagging revenues, stamps would soon offer images of celebrated living persons, chosen by the Committee in response to suggestions submitted by the public via surface mail and social networks on the Internet. The revised criterion reads: [...] "The Postal Service will honor living {{men and women who have}} made extraordinary contributions to American society and culture." ...|$|E
50|$|While {{working for}} a {{brokerage}} firm, he made a delivery to a stamp dealer on Nassau Street, the hub <b>for</b> <b>New</b> York <b>stamp</b> dealers. This meeting started Herst on his course to becoming a stamp dealer himself.|$|R
50|$|Combining big Roadmaster {{room with}} an {{economical}} Special engine {{continued to make}} the Super an American favorite in 1947. The Super was little changed from its 1946 counterpart, except <b>for</b> <b>new</b> <b>stamped</b> grille that had separate upper bar and new emblem. Stainless lower body moldings made a single line along the body and continued onto the standard wheelhouse shields. A white Tenite steering wheel was standard while the instruments were round and set into a two-toned dash panel. Exterior series identification {{was found on the}} crossbars between the standard bumper guards. A chrome emblem was used with the series script embossed and filled with red. Sales reached a record 159,588. The height was 64.9 inches. Brakes were 12 inch drums.|$|R

2500|$|The 10¢ [...] "orange" [...] (yellow) regular {{issue was}} printed and issued in 1923, 1925 and 1927, {{and was the}} first {{definitive}} issue to honor Monroe. Clair Aubrey Houston designed the Monroe stamp, choosing the image of the president previously used on the 3-cent issue of the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition Series. Edward J. Hein transferred George Simille's engraved portrait to a new die and restored it <b>for</b> the <b>new</b> <b>stamp.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cooch also {{designed}} and etched designs <b>for</b> <b>New</b> Zealand postage <b>stamps,</b> notably the 1935 5d Swordfish in ultramarine {{as well as}} the Hygeia Goddess of Health, health stamp of 1932.|$|R
5000|$|By early 1868, the {{existing}} definitive series of U.S. stamps {{had been used}} {{for more than six}} years and plates were no longer in pristine condition. Problematic as well was that these stamps had indelible associations with the Civil War, a calamity that was an unpopular association in America. The printer of these stamps, the National Banknote Company, was operating under a contract that expired in February 1869, which meant that the Post Office would soon have to solicit bids <b>for</b> a <b>new</b> four-year stamp-production contract. These circumstances made 1868 an ideal year for the Post Office to plan a <b>new</b> definitive <b>stamp</b> series: <b>for</b> bidders on the contract could be required to submit essays <b>for</b> <b>new</b> <b>stamp</b> designs along with their proposals. The Post Office advertisement for bids recommended a new imaginative method, even stating [...] "that there should be variety in the sizes as well as the designs of the stamps". While a variety of sizes was not ultimately produced, this stipulation may have been the germ of the decision to adopt a new size and <b>new</b> shape <b>for</b> the pictorials.|$|R
50|$|The stamp {{program of}} a postal {{organization}} is an umbrella {{term for the}} entire process of postage stamp issuance and distribution by the organization. Aspects include the decision of about stamps to issue, what postal rates they will pay, postage stamp design, printing, and publicity <b>for</b> the <b>new</b> <b>stamps.</b> The stamp program is generally managed by a specialized department within the organization, which balances demands {{from the rest of}} the organization, the nation's government, stamp collectors, and the public which actually buy and use the stamps.|$|R
5000|$|James Monroe Clair Aubrey Huston {{designed}} the Monroe stamp. For Monroes image he used an engraving done by George F.C. Simille previously {{used to produce}} the 3-cent issue of the 1904 Louisiana Purchase Exposition Series. Edward J. Hein transferred Simille’s engraving to a new die and restored it <b>for</b> the <b>new</b> <b>stamp.</b> Simille’s engraving was probably based on an engraving by Asher Durand, which itself {{seems to have been}} based on a painting by John Vanderlyn which now hangs in City Hall, New York City.|$|R
50|$|The local {{officials}} in Yuan dynasty evolved a working method from which their successors had never departed, until 1376: the imperial court commanded that local governments send an official courier {{to report their}} figures about the items at year's end, with the stamped documents. The stamped documents would be cross-checked before they were submitted to the Ministry of Revenue eventually. If the figures didn't seem to tally, the courier had to return <b>for</b> a <b>new</b> <b>stamped</b> document to submit. To avoid traipsing from their seats to the capital, these officials decided to carry spare prestamped documents.|$|R
50|$|One of his {{numerous}} pupils was {{his successor}} at the Mint, Hamerani (Hameran, a German), {{the founder of}} the long-lived Hamerani family of artists. As long as cast medals were generally used, public interest in the portrait predominated, and the reverse was usually neglected; this changed with the introduction of the stamping technique. We know only a few cast medals of Molo; he preferred the stamped medal. It seems that he was responsible <b>for</b> <b>new</b> ideas in <b>stamping</b> technique.|$|R
5000|$|The Columbian stamps were {{supplied}} by the American Banknote Company, which had a four-year contract {{for the production of}} United States postage stamps beginning December 1, 1889. However, where previous contracts had required printing companies to provide designs and plates at their own expense <b>for</b> any <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> required by the Post Office, the 1889 contract specified that the Post Office would pay those costs. [...] Indeed, Postmaster John Wanamaker (of department store fame) executed a new contract with American Banknote specifically for the Columbian stamps without any competitive bidding process, which allowed the company to charge 17¢ per thousand stamps, in contrast to the 7.45¢ per thousand it had been collecting for stamps of the 1890 definitive series. This arrangement prompted considerable public criticism—- not allayed by American Banknote’s argument that the Columbians’ size (double that of normal stamps) warranted a higher price—- and Wilson Bissel, who became Postmaster General after Grover Cleveland reassumed the Presidency during March 1893, attempted to renegotiate the stamp contract on terms more favorable to the Post Office.|$|R
5|$|From 1948, H.R. Holmes {{had been}} the curator but in the late 1950s had wished to {{relinquish}} the post. A replacement curator was not easily found and {{the care of the}} Collections was managed on a part-time basis. A security crisis in 1959 developed after it was discovered that the contents of one of the frames in the Tapling Collection was missing. In 1961 James A. Mackay was recruited as a research assistant {{to take care of the}} Collections. In 1971 the police arrested Mackay (promoted to Assistant Keeper in 1965) and charged him with stealing items from the British Museum Philatelic Collections on loan from the Crown Agents. The stolen progressive proofs (test prints of stamp designs) should have been returned to the Crown Agents for destruction and were valued at £7,600. Mackay had exchanged the proofs for Winston Churchill stamps worth £400. He was fined £1,000 and dismissed from the Museum. As a result of the thefts, security was improved by recruiting Bob Schoolley-West, one of the investigating police officers. The Crown Agents withdrew their agreement <b>for</b> lending <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> <b>for</b> display in the King's Library.|$|R
50|$|In Melbourne, Strutt found {{employment}} as an illustrator on the short-lived Illustrated Australian Magazine, published by Thomas Ham, {{as there was}} little demand for the figurative and history paintings {{for which he was}} trained. Some of his designs did, however, lead to commissions, including a design <b>for</b> a <b>new</b> postage <b>stamp,</b> and an Anti-Transportation League card. Despite the lack of interest for major history paintings in Melbourne, Strutt continued to sketch suitable subjects, including the ‘Black Thursday’ bushfires, which swept over the colony on 6 February 1851. It was from these sketches that Strutt composed one of his most notable paintings some 10 years later, Black Thursday, 6 February. 1851, 1864, which depicted animals and men fleeing from the fire.|$|R
50|$|On June 13, 1898, Congress {{passed the}} War Revenue Act of 1898 to provide badly needed {{funding for the}} Spanish-American War. The law was to become {{effective}} on July 1, 1898, leaving only seventeen days to produce the badly needed revenue stamps. In anticipation of the law's passage the Bureau of Engraving and Printing had already commenced work on the dies and printing plates <b>for</b> the <b>new</b> revenue <b>stamps,</b> however {{they were unable to}} issue the stamps when the law went into effect. To meet the demand for revenue stamps, existing stocks of standard postage stamps (issued in 1895-1898) were overprinted with the initials I.R. (i.e., Internal Revenue) for use as revenue stamps. Initials are faint on issues with denominations of 8, 10 and 15-cents.|$|R
50|$|The first {{breast cancer}} {{awareness}} stamp in the U.S., featuring a pink ribbon, was issued 1996. As {{it did not}} sell well, a <b>new</b> <b>stamp</b> {{with an emphasis on}} research was designed. The <b>new</b> <b>stamp</b> does not feature the pink ribbon.|$|R

2500|$|In early 1872, it was {{announced}} that <b>new</b> <b>stamps</b> would soon be issued. [...] When they were not ready on time, a number of the Full Faced Hidalgo stamps which had been demonetized and returned to Mexico City were re-issued overprinted with the word [...] "Anotado", meaning [...] "accounted for."

50|$|As his {{correspondence}} with al-Badr continued, {{he received an}} invitation to visit the country. After relocating to Sana'a, Yemen, Conde renounced his American citizenship and converted to Islam in 1958. He was granted Yemeni citizenship and a passport. Conde convinced the Imam that Yemen could make money selling postage stamps to collectors and was placed {{in charge of the}} country's philatelic office, which eventually caused some friction between Conde and the Minister of Communications. Conde was accused of espionage and expelled from the country and his passport revoked. Without travel documents, he spent three weeks in the Cairo Airport before moving to Beirut, Lebanon where he became a correspondent <b>for</b> Linn's <b>Stamp</b> <b>News.</b>|$|R

50|$|He then {{produced}} {{a series of}} Captain Justice stories for Calvert Publications, {{but they had to}} be largely re-drawn to satisfy 1950s censorship rules and regulations, e.g. the hero's face could not be entirely hidden, no flashes could issue from guns, no character could carry an offensive weapon in the hand, and no-one was allowed to be killed. He also wrote and illustrated eight books for Calvert about a war-time American, Kent Blake of the Secret Service. Wedd then created strips <b>for</b> <b>Stamp</b> <b>News</b> (on the history of the stamp) and for Dr T.S. Hepworth's Australian Children's Newspaper, drawing many full page adventure comics, an association which lasted for sixteen years. From 1958 he was a regular contributor to Chuckler's Weekly and for Telegraph Newspapers, with Captain Justice and King Comet.|$|R
50|$|In the end, {{successful}} stamp designs receive {{relatively little}} notice {{from the general}} public, but considerable praise from the philatelic press.
