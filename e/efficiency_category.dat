This study focuses on analyzing the technical efficiency and environmental impact (via insecticide use) of Bt cotton farms compared to non-Bt cotton farms using the stochastic frontier approach and the Environmental Impact Quotient (EIQ), considering primary data from agriculturally progressive states of India. The results indicate that average technical efficiency is higher in Bt cotton farming. Roughly 80 % of Bt cotton farms fall in the <b>efficiency</b> <b>category</b> of 80 - 95 %; this percentage falls to 60 % in non-Bt farms. In addition, Bt cotton demonstrates a lower EIQ value than non-Bt cotton, indicating less damage to the environment.

The purpose of this assessment is to support the Marine Corps Base, Okinawa in evaluating medium voltage distribution transformers for potential efficiency upgrades. The original scope of work included the MCB providing actual transformer nameplate data, manufacturer’s factory test sheets, electrical system data (kWh), demand data (kWd), power factor data, and electricity cost data. Unfortunately, the MCB’s actual data is not available and therefore making it necessary to de-scope the original assessment. Note: Any similar nameplate data, photos of similar transformer nameplates, and basic electrical details from one-line drawings (provided by MCB) are not a replacement for actual load loss test data. It is recommended that load measurements are performed on {{the high and low}} sides of transformers to better quantify actual load losses, demand data, and power factor data. We also recommend that actual data, when available, be inserted by MCB Okinawa where assumptions have been made and then the LCC analysis updated.

40|$|Power Saving Class (PSC) is an {{essential}} issue on IEEE 802. 16 - 2009. In previous research, many algorithms had been proposed to reduce the consumption of power, {{but most of them}} only considered multiple connections in a Mobile Subscriber Station (MSS); in fact, it does not fit in with the situation of real world. On the contrary, others proposed algorithms considering the situation of multiple MSSs with multiple connections; nevertheless, it is difficult {{to increase the amount of}} MSSs. In this paper, we propose an efficient algorithm, which refers to both categories and avoids state transitions. When packet size is much smaller or delay bound is more loosening, the result shows that our scheduling algorithm can serve almost double multiple MSSs with multiple connections and still maintain high sleep ratio for energy <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Categories</b> and Subject Descriptor...|$|R
40|$|With the {{increasing}} amount of text data stored in relational databases, {{there is a}} demand for RDBMS to support keyword queries over text data. As a search result is often assembled from multiple relational tables, traditional IR-style ranking and query evaluation methods cannot be applied directly. In this paper, we study the effectiveness and the efficiency issues of answering top-k keyword query in relational database systems. We propose a new ranking formula by adapting existing IR techniques based on a natural notion of virtual document. Compared with previous approaches, our new ranking method is simple yet effective, and agrees with human perceptions. We also study efficient query processing methods for the new ranking method, and propose algorithms that have minimal accesses to the database. We have conducted extensive experiments on large-scale real databases using two popular RDBMSs.

40|$|Background: Practice on Virtual Reality {{simulators}} (VRS) {{have been}} shown to improve surgical performance. However, VRS are expensive and usually housed in surgical skills centres that may be inaccessible at times convenient for surgical trainees to practice. Conversely, box trainers are inexpensive and can be used anywhere at anytime. This study assesses “take-home” Box Trainers (BT) as an alternative to VRS. Methods: After baseline assessments (two simulated laparoscopic cholecystectomies, one on a VRS and one on a BT) 25 surgical trainees were randomised to two groups. Trainees were asked to practice 3 basic laparoscopic tasks for 6 weeks (BT group using a “take-home” box trainer; VR group using VRS in clinical skills centres). After the practice period all performed two LC, one on a VRS and one on a BT; (i. e. post-training assessment). VRS provided metrics (total time (TT), number of movements (NOM) instrument tip path length (PL)) and expert video assessment of cholecystectomy in a BT (GOALS score) were recorded. Performance during pre- and post-training assessment was compared. Results: The BT group showed a significant improvement for all VRS metrics (p= 0. 008) and the <b>efficiency</b> <b>category</b> of GOALS score (p= 0. 03). Only TT improved in the VRS group and none of the GOALS categories demonstrated a statistically significant improvement after training. Finally, the improvement in VRS metrics in the BT group was significantly greater than in the VR group (TT p= 0. 005, NOM p= 0. 042, PL p= 0. 031) although there were no differences in the GOALS scores between the groups.

Parallel cache-efficient stencil algorithms based on “trapezoidal decompositions” are known, but most programmers find them difficult to write. The Pochoir stencil compiler allows a programmer to write a simple specification of a stencil in a domain-specific stencil language embedded in C++ which the Pochoir compiler then translates into high-performing Cilk code that employs an efficient parallel cache-oblivious algorithm. Pochoir supports general d-dimensional stencils and handles both periodic and aperiodic boundary conditions in one unified algorithm. The Pochoir system provides a C++ template library that allows the user’s stencilspecificationtobeexecuteddirectlyinC++withoutthePochoir compiler(albeitmoreslowly),whichsimplifiesuserdebuggingand greatly simplified {{the implementation of the}} Pochoir compiler itself. A host of stencil benchmarks run on a modern multicore machine demonstrates that Pochoir outperforms standard parallelloop implementations, typically running 2 – 10 times faster.

40|$|An {{algorithm}} is presented for the geometric analysis of an algebraic curve f(x, y) = 0 {{in the real}} affine plane. It computes a cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD) of the plane, augmented with adjacency information. The adjacency information describes the curve’s topology by a topologically equivalent planar graph. The numerical data in the CAD gives an embedding of the graph. The {{algorithm is}} designed to provide the exact result for all inputs but to perform only few symbolic operations for the sake of efficiency. In particular, the roots of f(α, y) at a critical x-coordinate α are found with adaptive-precision arithmetic in all cases, using a variant of the Bitstream Descartes method (Eigenwillig et al., 2005). The algorithm may choose a generic coordinate system for parts of the analysis but provides its result in the original system. The algorithm is implemented as C++ library AlciX in the EXACUS project.

40|$|More {{competitive}} regions tend {{to present}} {{higher level of}} economic growth, with positive reflexes on social aspects. The different economic performances observed among regions are explained mainly by the spatial concentration of the economic activities. This paper aims to analyze the influence of space on the regional competitiveness behavior of the Brazilian manufacturing industry. In doing so, it uses a panel data of 137 mesoregions and industry sectors that are aggregated in four categories according to technology intensity, during 2000 to 2006. We apply the stochastic frontier of production methodology to obtain the measures of regional efficiency and the Markov spatial transition matrixes that analyze the dynamic of the transition of the regions among <b>efficiency</b> <b>categories</b> considering their local spatial context. We found evidences {{that there is a}} higher probability of the regions to become less competitive when the neighborhood is not considered. On the other hand, when considering spatial influences, we observed that the probability of a good neighborhood (more competitive) in stimulating the region's efficiency is higher than the probability of a bad neighborhood (less competitive) in lowering its efficiency. In other words, the pull effect of the neighborhood in the competitiveness of the Brazilian regions is stronger than the drag effect...|$|R
40|$|Herein is {{reported}} development {{and testing of}} a life cycle analysis (LCA) procedure for assessing {{the environmental impact of}} induction motors. The operating conditions of a given industrial application are defined by the mechanical power required, operating hours and service life of the three-phase induction motor involved. Based on manufacturer’s data mainly,different three-phase induction motors for various sets of operating conditions, including oversizing, have been selected. To quantify the environmental impact of each motor, the Methodology for the Ecodesign of Energy Using Products (MEEUP) was applied, according to the quantity of each of the motor’s main constituent materials used in the production phase, and to the two operating variables that directly influence the LCA results: output power and efficiency. The procedure was applied to different three-phase induction motors representing two <b>efficiency</b> <b>categories</b> (IE 1 and IE 2) and considering different oversizing possibilities. The total environmental impact of each motor was determined based on the production, service life and end-of-life phases. The best motor option was identified for different operating conditions.

40|$|In {{approximate}} computing, programs gain efficiency by al-lowing occasional errors. Controlling the probabilistic ef-fects of this approximation {{remains a}} key challenge. We propose {{a new approach}} where programmers use a type system to communicate high-level constraints on the de-gree of approximation. A combination of type inference, code specialization, and optional dynamic tracking makes the system expressive and convenient. The core type sys-tem captures the probability that each operation exhibits an error and bounds the probability that each expression devi-ates from its correct value. Solver-aided type inference lets the programmer specify the correctness probability on only some variables—program outputs, for example—and auto-matically fills in other types to meet these specifications. An optional dynamic type helps cope with complex run-time behavior where static approaches are insufficient. Together, these features interact to yield {{a high degree of}} programmer control while offering a strong soundness guarantee. We use existing approximate-computing benchmarks to show how our language, DECAF, maintains a low annota-tion burden. Our constraint-based approach can encode hard-ware details, such as finite degrees of reliability, so we also use DECAF to examine implications for approximate hard-ware design. We find that multi-level architectures can offer advantages over simpler two-level machines and that solver-aided optimization improves <b>efficiency.</b> <b>Categories</b> and Subject Descriptors D. 3. 3 [Programmin...|$|R

Effective delegation increases productivity as well as production capacity (Burns, 2001). Delegation cannot be viewed as an abstract technique; it depends on individuals and individual needs (Blair, 2003). In this context, a non-experimental ex post facto or correlation design study was used to investigate how delegation was being performed by nurse managers (head nurses) at two different settings (Elshohada Hospital and Quesna Hospital in the Al Minufiyah Governorate of Egypt). A second purpose of the study was to identify the effect that delegation had on head nurses’ productivity. A convincing sample of 35 head nurses working in different units in the two hospitals was included in the study. Data were collected by two tools. The first tool was a two-part questionnaire.

The research focused on the impact of HIV/AIDS on different <b>efficiency</b> <b>categories,</b> labour and production costs and competitiveness categories. The South African health sector, specifically the public health sector is under pressure in terms of funding, staff and infrastructure. This situation is putting pressure on the effective combat of HIV/AIDS in the country. The private health sector is more and more required to help to enhance the capacity of health services in South Africa. Firms are also required to make more health funding available to their employees and in some cases (such as the fight against HIV/AIDS) to supply health services within the organisation. HIV/AIDS is a serious illness that results in a situation where employees are not operating at their full potential. If left untreated it could have very negative impacts/effects not only for the employee but also for the efficiency and competitiveness of the firm. Firm are thus more and more forced on instituting effective HIV/AIDS programmes in the working place. The aim is to lessen the negative impact that HIV/AIDS might have on different efficiency levels, labour and production cost levels and on competitiveness in general. The results of the study indicated that HIV/AIDS have serious implications for firm-efficiency and firm-competitiveness. It was also learned from the results that bigger firms already have HIV/AIDS programmes in place in order to counter the negative impacts of HIV/AIDS in the working place...|$|R
