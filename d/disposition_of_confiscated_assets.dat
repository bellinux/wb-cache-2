5000|$|In {{apparent}} {{conflict with}} this decision, another law was {{ratified by the}} parliament in 1992 (when another politician, Mehdi Karroubi was speaker of the parliament), calling for the transfer <b>of</b> <b>confiscated</b> <b>assets</b> {{to the government and}} establishing an Organization for Collection and Sale of State-owned Properties of Iran under the Ministry of Economic Affairs and Finance to deal with those assets. Despite clearly transferring control <b>of</b> <b>confiscated</b> <b>assets</b> to the government, this law was never implemented mainly due to circulars issued by chief justice Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi in 2009, and by his successor, chief justice Sadeq Larijani in 2013. (The Chief Justice in Iran is appointed by Supreme Leader of Iran based on Article 110 of Iranian constitution.) ...|$|R
40|$|This book {{analyses}} {{laws and}} practices {{for the management}} and disposal <b>of</b> <b>confiscated</b> <b>assets</b> in the European Union. The analysis explores the challenges and best practices of the Member States in this hitherto neglected area and strives to contribute to improvement of the overall effectiveness of the existing confiscation systems. It was prepared {{in the context of}} the Study RECAST – REuse <b>of</b> <b>Confiscated</b> <b>Assets</b> for social purposes: towards common EU Standards. The Study was awarded to the University of Palermo – Department of European Studies and International Integration by the European Commission, DG Home Affairs, under the 2010 ISEC Programme. It was carried out in cooperation with the Center for the Study of Democracy and the FLARE Network (co-beneficiaries) and with the support of the Italian Agenzia nazionale per l’amministrazione e la destinazione dei beni sequestrati e confiscati alla criminalità organizzata and UNICRI (associate partners) ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{subsequent}} years WIR supported workers in Germany {{and other countries}} suffering {{from the effects of}} strikes, armed conflict, and natural catastrophes by distribution of clothes, food, and funds by adding an industrial assistance program. [...] Initial funding of WIR was through secret Soviet funding in the form of ten million paper rubles (sovznaki) issued directly from the Soviet Central Bank. [...] Most of WIR's funding assistance was provided through bank credits backed by the Kremlin; other sources included fund drives and tool/technology donations from other countries, from sales <b>of</b> <b>confiscated</b> <b>assets,</b> and from sales of donated foreign equipment such as tractors to private bidders and enterprises inside the Soviet Union.|$|R

5000|$|In a 2006 report, a Congressional Committee {{opined that}} the State had “acknowledged the debt {{and promised to}} pay it” by issuing the Land Reform Bonds, but “as {{the value of the}} {{currency}} deteriorated,” it had become “essential” to apply an adjustment factor that “to the extent possible, would allow the value <b>of</b> the <b>confiscated</b> <b>assets</b> to remain constant.” ...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{theoretical}} model, this paper intends to show, first, that the confiscation of illegal assets {{can produce a}} direct impact on the choices of the criminal, reducing the expected utility derived from illegal activities. Secondly, it tries to show how the reuse for social purposes <b>of</b> the <b>confiscated</b> <b>assets</b> can favour the growth of mutual trust among individuals, sustaining an economy alternative to the criminal one...|$|R
25|$|By {{the time}} {{all these factors}} had had their effect on the {{valuation}} <b>of</b> the <b>confiscated</b> <b>assets,</b> very little was left. In total, NOK 7.8 million was awarded to principals and heirs <b>of</b> Jewish property <b>confiscated</b> by the Nazis. This was less than the administrative fees charged by governmental agencies for probate. It did not include assets seized by the government that belonged to non-Norwegian citizens, and that of citizens that left no legal heirs. This last category was formidable, as 230 entire Jewish households were killed {{during the course of}} the Shoah.|$|R
50|$|Irrespective of {{what those}} at court thought, he was {{unanimously}} found guilty and the sentence {{of the court}} was that he be hanged, drawn and quartered (the sentence was later commuted to beheading). He asked for his debts be paid out <b>of</b> his <b>confiscated</b> <b>assets</b> {{so that no one}} would suffer from his death, and he continued to be distressed about his debts whilst awaiting death. In fact his distress was so acute that the Constable of the Tower, William Kingston wrote to Cromwell twice begging him to help ease George's conscience.|$|R
50|$|The National Assembly {{passed a}} bill called the Chun Doo-hwan Act, {{extending}} the statute <b>of</b> limitations on <b>confiscating</b> <b>assets</b> from public officials who have failed to pay fines. Under the old law, prosecutors had only until October 2013, but the new law extends {{the statute of limitations}} on Chun's case until 2020 and allows prosecutors to collect from his family members as well if it is proven that any of their properties originated from Chun's illegal funds.|$|R
50|$|The <b>assets</b> <b>confiscated</b> {{from the}} Egyptian branch {{of his family}} were valued at over 1.4 million Egyptian pounds. Most <b>of</b> the <b>assets</b> <b>confiscated</b> were through David Ades & Son, which {{operated}} in Cairo and Alexandria. The family’s private property was also confiscated by the Iraqi government. As of 2001, a children’s store with the Ades name continued to operate in Cairo, under ownership of the Iraqi government.|$|R
40|$|This chapter {{discusses}} the methodological challenges in defining, operationalising and measuring organised crime infiltration in legal businesses. It first reviews existing definitions {{and measures of}} organised crime; it then focuses on infiltration, outlining the differences {{with respect to the}} concepts of organised crime investments and money laundering. It {{discusses the}} strengths and the weaknesses of existing measures and methodological approaches (e. g. analysis <b>of</b> statistics on <b>confiscated</b> <b>assets,</b> <b>of</b> personal holdings, of case studies), suggesting further directions to improve the collection of data and research in this field...|$|R
50|$|Jay's wish finally becomes reality when {{he travels}} to Kampala {{to attend a}} court {{proceeding}} on the <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> his previously <b>confiscated</b> house.

Jay returns to America and relinquishes his long-nurtured dream of returning to Uganda, the place he considered home.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{the theme}} of Social Innovation (SI) has gained {{significant}} importance both in academic studies and in policy. In the many definitions of SI proposed by scholars the aspect of change seems to be central. Making social innovation means to find and to provide new solutions to the social needs of individuals and communities; to develop and to introduce changes in the relationships between individuals and institutions; and again, to redefine the priorities {{of the economic and}} social development. In this paper we focus on a particular form of SI realized by social cooperatives operating in Italy on <b>assets</b> <b>confiscated</b> from the mafia. Thanks to a law of popular initiative these goods can be allotted to social cooperatives to carry on entrepreneurial activities, involving also disadvantaged people at the risk of social exclusion. In this way it is possible to generate employment and to increase social, cultural and economic development of the affected local communities. The social use makes such goods productive and allows a redemption from the mafia. The very existence of these cooperatives has an important symbolic value affirming the presence of the State and enhancing the credibility of the Institutions. The aim {{of this paper is to}} identify the factors that support this kind of entrepreneurship generating SI and difficulties to overcome for its diffusion in the country. To this end, the SI literature and the Italian set <b>of</b> rules concerning <b>confiscated</b> <b>assets</b> will be analyzed. The analysis of institutional documents of associations and institutes involved in the creation process of the social cooperatives, integrated by interviews to key actors, will complete the theorical phase. Then, a case of entrepreneurship in the Sicilian country will be presented with a qualitative approach adopting the representative single case method. The study shows the importance of certain factors supporting the development of this kind of entrepreneurship, namely: a network of actors involved in the creation of social cooperatives; a synergic collaboration among the different actors around a common purpose; an extraordinary commitment and the cooperation between institutions and anti-mafia associations. The critical issues that limit its diffusion in the country are represented by the following aspects: the assignment times <b>of</b> <b>confiscated</b> <b>assets</b> (still too long); the lack of financial resources to ensure a timely and effective use of the assets; the difficulties of access to credit for cooperatives...|$|R
50|$|Collette {{transferred}} the properties around among his various companies, and by 1973, he had clearly {{communicated to the}} residents {{that he was not}} interested in operating the water system. The Thunderbird Homeowners Association—later, Thunderbird Property Owners Association—which had been formed in 1969 and incorporated in 1971, began to investigate the possibility of taking over the water system itself, not without disharmony among the members. In 1979, the Insurance Commissioner <b>of</b> Indiana <b>confiscated</b> the <b>assets</b> <b>of</b> Collette's now-defunct Pilgrim Life Insurance Company, and the State of Indiana briefly owned Thunderbird Mountain before selling it to Executive National Life Insurance in 1981.|$|R
2500|$|Another {{important}} factor for this hostility {{by many in}} the Jewish community (including some Holocaust survivors) is that Hilberg refused to view the vast majority of Jewish victims' [...] "passivity" [...] as a form of heroism or resistance (in contrast to those Jews who actively resisted, waging armed struggle against the Nazis). Equally controversially, he provided an analysis for this passivity in the context of Jewish history. The Jews, Hilberg argued, were convinced [...] "the persecutor would not destroy what he could economically exploit." [...] Hilberg calculated the economic value of Jewish slave labor to the Nazis as being several times the entire value <b>of</b> <b>confiscated</b> Jewish <b>assets,</b> and used this as evidence that the destruction of Jews continued irrespective of economic considerations. Additionally, Hilberg estimated the total number of Germans killed by Jews during World War II as less than 300, an estimate that is not conducive to an image of heroic struggle.|$|R
25|$|On 27 May 1995, Bjørn Westlie {{published}} {{an article in the}} daily, Dagens Næringsliv, that highlighted the uncompensated financial loss incurred by the Norwegian Jewish community as a result of Nazi persecution during the war.

40|$|The paper aims at {{analysing}} {{the role}} of reusing for social purposes <b>of</b> the <b>assets</b> <b>confiscated</b> from criminal organisations (currently regulated by the New Anti-Mafia Code, issued by Legislative Decree No. 159 / 2011) and intends to show –using a theoretical model based on the insights of the Social Network Analysis and Theory of Evolving Networks –that is possible to defeat criminal networks using the same “weapons”which criminal organizations use, {{that is the same}} social capital and those same network of relationships which constitute their strength...|$|R

5000|$|The Venetian {{government}} {{established a}} special tribunal that condemned to death the main exponents of the revolt, {{but failed to}} adjudicate the real author, Antonio Savorgnan who, given the overall negative outcome, paradoxically found shelter among the imperialists' ranks which he had so long opposed to, in Villaco, on an Austrian territory. Yet the revenge was not late to come since a strumieri conspiracy organized his assassination that happened on 27 March 1512 {{at the exit from}} the Villaco cathedral by Spilimbergo's and Colloredo's noblemen's hand. The governor <b>of</b> Venice <b>confiscated</b> his <b>assets</b> in 1549 and destroyed the Savorgnan palace in Udine leaving its ruins as a warning in what was called plazze de rovine (or [...] "piazza della rovina", [...] "square of the ruin" [...] in friulan language, now [...] "Venerio square", after Udinese metereologist Gerolamo Venerio).|$|R

40|$|Australia’s unexplained wealth laws {{form part}} {{of a range of}} {{measures}} introduced in response to growing concern about the prevalence and impact of organised crime. The confiscation of criminal assets, including through the use of unexplained wealth legislation, seeks to undermine the business model of organised crime by removing its financial return, punishing offenders, compensating society, preventing the improper use of assets and deterring participation in crime. The Australian Crime Commission has conservatively estimated that serious and organised crime cost Australia $ 36 b in 2013 – 14. According to published national statistics, the total value <b>of</b> <b>assets</b> <b>confiscated</b> in Australian jurisdictions between 1995 – 96 and 2013 – 14 was approximately $ 800 m, averaging around $ 44 m annually. The discrepancy between these two amounts clearly shows {{more needs to be done}} to target the profits of organised crime. This paper reviews Australia’s current approaches to confiscating unexplained wealth and aims to identify any barriers to their implementation, to inform effective procedural reforms to the laws and better target the proceeds of crime of Australia’s most serious criminals...|$|R
40|$|Ownership is in {{the former}} Yugoslavia after World War II, saved the {{confiscation}} of property from private owners, and then, {{in accordance with the}} general trend of collectivization, by converting private property in national, and then to the state and social ownership. State, and then the social ownership dominated in all areas of economic and social life, while private property was suppressed {{to such an extent that}} it was statistically insignificant. The problem of indemnification of legal and physical entities, which in the period from 1945 to 1958 <b>confiscated</b> <b>assets</b> based on groups of regulations on nationalization, confiscation, agrarian reform and others. measures was a long time one of the most important unresolved issues, which conflicted public in Serbia. To adequately deal with this problem, are interested primarily former owners <b>of</b> <b>confiscated</b> property, but the current owners or users of nationalized property. The subject of this paper is the restitution of real estate and registration of legal consequences of restitution in public records, the case of religious communities in the municipality of Subotica...|$|R
50|$|The EFTPS website {{claims that}} the Internal Revenue Service and other {{government}} agencies do not obtain access to the enrollee's account, and only payments explicitly scheduled or authorized by the enrollee are processed by the website.

Suspected drug-related assets worth $1.18 million were frozen, awaiting confiscation proceedings.|$|R
50|$|In December 1931, the Reich Flight Tax was {{implemented}} {{as part of}} a larger emergency decree with the goal of stemming capital flight during the unstable Interbellum period.

This tax was officially repealed in 1953.|$|R
50|$|In 2016, the U.S. Department of Justice seized $850 {{million that}} was funneled through corrupt deals by Karimova.

China repossessed all Japanese assets in Manchuria and Inner Mongolia, which included mineworks and railway infrastructure. Moreover, Article 4 of the treaty stated that [...] "the <b>disposition</b> <b>of</b> property of Japan and of its nationals...and their claims...against the authorities presently administering such areas and the residents...shall {{be the subject of}} special arrangements between Japan and such authorities."

40|$|Citizens and {{companies}} globalize: they are increasingly {{making use of}} their rights to free movement, to free settlement, to offer services and goods, to realize financial transactions, etc. Enforcement systems, including the criminal justice system, have to follow suit. They are obliged to go abroad to gather evidence, for the detention and extradition or surrender <b>of</b> suspects, to <b>confiscate</b> <b>assets,</b> to deal with conflicts of jurisdiction and the choice of allocating a criminal investigation and adjudication. Globalizing criminal justice systems {{increases the risk of}} double prosecution and/or double punishment. Do (legal) persons have the (fundamental) right not to be prosecuted or punished twice for the same facts in a globalizing and integrating world. Are they protected against these forms of double jeopardy in settings of transnational criminal justice, such as for instance in the EU area of freedom, security and justice? Does the ne bis in idem principle have a transnational reach? If so, what does this mean and what are the obstacles and exceptions thereto? In posing these questions, this article asks whether a (legal) person can derive a right to transnational protection in the area of freedom, security and justice from the different sources of ne bis in idem obligations in domestic law, in public international law (human rights law and mutual legal assistance) and in EU law. By analysing these sources and the case law thereon, I {{come to the conclusion that}} (legal) persons are unprotected against transnational double jeopardy, with the exception of the transnational ne bis in idem in the EU area of freedom, security and justice. However, even in the case of the latter exceptions, derogations, reservations and draw back interpretations based on national sovereignty undermine the rationale and scope of a real transnational ne bis in idem principle in a common space of transnational criminal justice...|$|R

5000|$|Asset {{forfeiture}} or {{asset seizure}} {{is a form}} of confiscation of assets by the state. It typically applies to the alleged proceeds or instruments of crime. This applies, but is not limited, to terrorist activities, drug related crimes, and other criminal and even civil offenses. Some jurisdictions specifically use the term [...] "confiscation" [...] instead of forfeiture. The alleged purpose of asset forfeiture is to disrupt criminal activity by <b>confiscating</b> <b>assets</b> that potentially could have been beneficial to the individual or organization.|$|R
2500|$|This {{was further}} {{complicated}} by the methodology employed by the legitimate Norwegian government after the war. In order to restore <b>confiscated</b> <b>assets</b> to their owners, the government was guided by public policy to [...] alleviate the economic impact on the economy by reducing compensation to approximate a sense of fairness and finance {{the reconstruction of the}} country's economy. The assessed value was thereby reduced by the Nazis' liquidation practices and was further reduced by the discounting applied as a result of governmental policy after the war.|$|R
