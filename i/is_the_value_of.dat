5|$|The {{second factor}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> protection: would the plant be {{less able to}} survive and {{reproduce}} after removal of part of its structure by a herbivore? Not all plant parts are of equal evolutionary value, thus valuable parts contain more defenses. A plant’s stage of development {{at the time of}} feeding also affects the resulting change in fitness. Experimentally, the fitness value of a plant structure is determined by removing that part of the plant and observing the effect. In general, reproductive parts are not as easily replaced as vegetative parts, terminal leaves have greater value than basal leaves, and the loss of plant parts mid-season has a greater negative effect on fitness than removal at the beginning or end of the season. Seeds in particular tend to be very well protected. For example, the seeds of many edible fruits and nuts contain cyanogenic glycosides such as amygdalin. This results from the need to balance the effort needed to make the fruit attractive to animal dispersers while ensuring that the seeds are not destroyed by the animal.|$|E

25|$|In numismatics, {{intrinsic}} value, {{also known}} as melt value, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the metal, typically a precious metal, in a coin. For example, if gold trades in commercial markets at a price of US$1200 per fine troy ounce, then a coin minted from one troy ounce of fine gold would have an intrinsic value of US$1200.|$|E

25|$|An {{ad valorem}} tax is one where the tax base <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> a good, service, or {{property}}. Sales taxes, tariffs, property taxes, inheritance taxes, and value added taxes are different types of {{ad valorem tax}}. An ad valorem tax is typically imposed {{at the time of}} a transaction (sales tax or value added tax (VAT)) but it may be imposed on an annual basis (property tax) or in connection with another significant event (inheritance tax or tariffs).|$|E
25|$|We {{conclude}} that the function ψ <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the minimizing integral A {{as a function of}} the upper end point. That is, when a family of minimizing curves is constructed, the values of the optical length satisfy the characteristic equation corresponding the wave equation. Hence, solving the associated partial differential equation of first order is equivalent to finding families of solutions of the variational problem. This is the essential content of the Hamilton–Jacobi theory, which applies to more general variational problems.|$|E
25|$|Most {{common is}} STRs (short tandem repeat). A certain section of DNA is {{examined}} for {{a pattern that}} repeats (e.g. ATCG). The number of times it repeats <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the marker. Typical tests test between 30 and 120 STR markers. STRs mutate fairly frequently. The results of two individuals are then compared {{to see if there}} is a match. Close matches may often join a surname project. DNA companies will usually provide information about how closely related two matches are, based on the difference between their results.|$|E

25|$|The {{national}} debt of the United States {{is the amount}} owed {{by the federal government}} of the United States. The measure of the public debt <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the outstanding Treasury securities at a point of time that have been issued by the Treasury and other federal government agencies. The terms national deficit and national surplus usually refer to the federal government budget balance from year to year, not the cumulative total. A deficit year increases the debt because more money is spent than is received; a surplus year decreases the debt because more money is received than spent.|$|E
25|$|Previously, some economists, such as Carl Menger {{and others}} of the Austrian School, {{maintained}} {{that the value of}} factors of production is the individual contribution of each in the final product, but its value <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> the last contributed to the final product (the marginal utility before reaching the point Pareto optimal). Thus, Wieser identified a flaw in the theory of imputation as expounded by his teacher, Carl Menger: overvaluation may occur if one is confronted with economies where profits jump (maximums and minimums in his utility function, where its second derivative equals 0). Wieser thus suggested as an alternative the simultaneous solution of a system of industrial equations.|$|E

500|$|In 1900 Nansen became {{director}} of the Christiania-based International Laboratory for North Sea Research, and helped found the International Council for the Exploration of the Sea. Through his connection with the latter body, {{in the summer of}} 1900 Nansen embarked on his first visit to Arctic waters since the Fram expedition, a cruise to Iceland and Jan Mayen Land on the oceanographic research vessel Michael Sars, named after Eva's father. Shortly after his return he learned that his Farthest North record had been passed, by members of the Duke of the Abruzzi's Italian expedition. They had reached 86°34′N on 24 April 1900, in an attempt to reach the North Pole from Franz Josef Land. Nansen received the news philosophically: [...] "What <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>value</b> <b>of</b> having goals for their own sake? They all vanish ... it is merely a question of time." ...|$|E

500|$|There are {{recurring}} {{themes that}} appear throughout the story.

Of the six main characters, Tomoya, Nagisa, and Kotomi have no siblings, though their parents are major factors in their stories. Nagisa's story was written to incorporate what Maeda described as a [...] "perfect family" [...] with a focus on mental consciousness. In Nagisa's story, there is a recurring appearance of [...] (a fictional group mascot for children) that Nagisa is fond of. Tomoya's and Nagisa's characters were written in a style to exemplify a [...] "growth to adulthood" [...] {{by the end of the}} story. Fuko's and Kyou's stories have their sisters playing an integral part, and Tomoyo's story is influenced by her entire family. A minor motif of Irish words continues with the opening theme of the game, [...] "Mag Mell", which means roughly [...] "plain of joy" [...] and is connected with Irish mythology. The arrange album, a short music CD that contained remixed versions of songs in the game, that was bundled with the original game release was titled Mabinogi, which was a collection of prose stories from medieval Welsh manuscripts.|$|E
