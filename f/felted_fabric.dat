50|$|Most baghouses use long, {{cylindrical}} bags (or tubes) made of woven or <b>felted</b> <b>fabric</b> as {{a filter}} medium. (For applications {{where there is}} relatively low dust loading and gas temperatures are 250 °F or less, pleated, nonwoven cartridges are sometimes used as filtering media instead of bags.) Dust-laden gas or air enters the baghouse through hoppers (large funnel-shaped containers used for storing and dispensing particulate) and is directed into the baghouse compartment. The gas is drawn through the bags, either on the inside or the outside depending on cleaning method, and a layer of dust accumulates on the filter media surface until air can no longer move through it. When sufficient pressure drop (delta P) occurs, the cleaning process begins. Cleaning can take place while the baghouse is online (filtering) or is offline (in isolation). When the compartment is clean, normal filtering resumes.|$|E
5000|$|Felted {{is a term}} {{variously}} {{applied to}} hairy or otherwise filamentous material that is densely packed or tangled, forming felt or felt-like structures. Apart from fibres in <b>felted</b> <b>fabric</b> manufactured by humans, the term [...] "felted" [...] may apply to the condition of hair {{such as in the}} pathological condition known as felted hair, or it may apply to the tangled threads of the tissue of certain fungi, to matted fibres in animal connective tissue, or to the felted outer coat of certain plants. To say that something is felted need not imply that any processes of matting, condensing and pressing fibres have been applied as in the processes for artificial production of felt fabric. Depending {{on the nature of the}} felted material, it might rely purely on the scaly or barbed texture of the matted fibres to prevent unraveling, but commonly it will include clayey or sticky materials for its structural integrity, or for increased density.|$|E
5000|$|Except {{for very}} common sizes, liners {{are not usually}} stocked and must be made {{specifically}} for each project. CIPP requires bypass of the flow in the existing pipeline while the liner is being installed. The curing may take from one hour to 30 hours depending on pipe diameter and curing system (steam / water / uv) and must be carefully monitored, inspected, and tested. Obstructions in the existing pipeline, such as protruding laterals, must be removed prior to installation. Cost should be compared with similar methods such as Shotcrete, thermoformed pipe, close-fit pipe, spiral wound pipe and sliplining as these other methods can provide a similar design solution for similar or less cost in certain situations. CIPP must also be carefully monitored for release of chemical agents utilized in the reaction process for contamination downstream of rehabilitated pipes. The liner material used for common sizes is normally a <b>felted</b> <b>fabric</b> (non-woven) and does not go around bends well without wrinkling and going out of round on corners. Liners used for pipes with bends (particularly 100 mm pipes) are made from a woven fabric allowing it to go around bends with minimal wrinkling. The more flexible the liner, the more care {{needs to be taken}} during inversion to ensure the liner remains on the correct alignment. Once a line is repaired with the CIPP method, that line can no longer be cabled or snaked with a machine, it must be cleaned by method of Hydro jetting ( [...] AKA. high pressure water blasting) ...|$|E

40|$|Felted wool {{techniques}} implementing sheep fibers {{have been}} used to create interesting and luxurious fashion collections; yet, <b>felted</b> <b>fabric</b> with alpaca fibers have not recently been explored to create apparel. Since alpaca does not carry lanolin, a common allergy found in sheep 2 ̆ 7 s wool, it could be an excellent substitute for creating felted textiles. Thus, the objective of this sweater design was to explore alpaca fiber 2 ̆ 7 s ability to create a functional, aesthetic, and organic felted garment. The overall design was inspired by the stark contrast of the pollutant side of the textile industry verse the emergence and interest of sustainable and ethical textiles.

Our aim was to identify an isolation material with the best quality–price relationship to acoustically coat such a flight room. For this, we built a flight room divided into two compartments that were to be acoustically isolated from one another. Audible and infrasonic waves are difficult to attenuate with low-cost materials but the attenuation of ultrasounds is rather straightforward. We evaluated the absorbing capacities of different low-cost materials – <b>felt</b> <b>fabric,</b> polystyrene, egg boxes, egg boxes coated with <b>felt</b> <b>fabric,</b> absorbing pyramidal foams, polyurethane foams and cork.

The analysis revealed that the pattern changed together with the variation of the sewing material used by the Alans of the North Caucasus from <b>felt</b> <b>fabric</b> with a certain width and length.

50|$|Steel-rule die, {{also known}} as cookie cutter dies, are used for cutting sheet metal and softer webs, such as plastics, wood, cork, <b>felt,</b> <b>fabrics,</b> and paperboard. The cutting surface of the die is the edge of {{hardened}} steel strips, known as steel rule. These steel rules are usually located using saw or laser-cut grooves in plywood. The mating die can be a flat piece of hardwood or steel, a male shape that matches the workpiece profile, or it can have a matching groove that allows the rule to nest into. Rubber strips are wedged in with the steel rule to act as the stripper plate; the rubber compresses on the down-stroke and on the up-stroke it pushes the workpiece out of the die. The main advantage of steel-rule dies is the low cost to make them, as compared to solid dies; however, {{they are not as}} robust as solid dies, so they are usually only used for short production runs.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. This paper investigates an {{inexpensive}} but potentially very effective reinforcement method for adobe block wall systems. Reinforcing fabric materials were {{embedded in the}} mortar between each layer of blocks to provide a barrier against the propagation of the dominant diagonal cracks which are commonly observed in adobe walls after a seismic event, and are {{largely responsible for the}} collapse of adobe structures. The effectiveness of the reinforcing materials in resisting and arresting cracks was investigated in splitting tension tests. Reinforced and unreinforced adobe walls were fabricated and tested in diagonal compression to simulate the transfer of shear due to lateral forces. <b>Felt</b> <b>fabric</b> reinforcement was found to provide the greatest physical deformation of the wall sample and greatest dissipation of energy while maintaining acceptable load-bearing capacity. The final displacement of the reinforced sample was found to be nearly three times that of the unreinforced control specimen. A secondary motivation for this investigation was to address the need for such engineering solutions to be highly affordable to those most likely to build with adobe block. Earthquakes have ravaged many regions of the world, and while advancements in engineering and life-safety codes have resulted in significant improvements in performance of modern structures, we must also seek out methods by which traditional building systems, which continue to house large numbers of people, can withstand the scrutiny of modern safety criteria. Further investigations are encouraged to determine location-specific solutions with this goal in mind...|$|R
40|$|Even {{though the}} Underground Railroad functioned {{more than a}} hundred years ago, people are still {{discussing}} certain aspects of that secret network of people who helped slaves escape from slavery. There is a particularly heated discussion still taking place online about the use of quilts in the Underground Railroad. This debate began when Jacqueline Tobin and Raymond bobard's book,,Hidden in Plain View: The Secret Story of Quilts and the Underground Railroad,, was published in 1999. This book asserted that slaves also used a ten-pattern quilt code to escape on the Underground Railroad. As I was doing research for my inter-disciplinary unit on the Underground Railroad (a requirement of my student teaching placement), I discovered Jacqueline Tobin and Raymond bobard's book, other picture books, and websites discussing the quilt code used on the Underground Railroad. The topic interested me and so I decided to expand upon the topic and create a thesis project that would use my students' and my own skills.
