Kresge {{is located on the}} Quad on main campus and hosts the main gym for the basketball and volleyball programs at Albion College. Kresge Gymnasium was renovated in 1988 and expanded to hold two full volleyball courts for practices and tournaments, as well as retractable seating for 1,400 people and a regulation-length basketball court with expanded practice areas. Until the Dean Aquatic Center was built in 1979, the basement of Kresge was originally the pool. Since then, the old pool space in the basement was converted into a number of different things. New locker rooms were built as were two athletic training rooms. In addition, half of the basement was converted into a dance studio and classroom, which today is still used for various dance teams and recreational yoga classes. Also renovated was a classroom overlooking the old courts, which is now featured as coaches' offices and a lounge for visitors and guests to observe the game. In addition to being the home of three athletic departments, Kresge Gymnasium is used for a number of other events. Graduation at Albion College takes place on the steps of Kresge, with each student crossing the steps to receive their diploma. Also, contemporary artists Neil Diamond, John Denver, and the rock group Chicago have played for audiences at Kresge, and <b>former</b> <b>President</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> made the front steps of Kresge his platform as commencement speaker while serving as vice president in 1986.|$|E
50|$|The Energy Policy Act of 1992 {{originally}} {{enacted the}} Production Tax Credit {{and the first}} lapse came in June 1999. The PTC was extended in December 1999 until December 31, 2001. Once again the PTC expired in December 2001 and was not enacted again until March 2002 where it was then extended for another two years. At the end of 2003 the PTC expired {{for a third time}} until a one-year extension was granted in October 2004. With the 2004 extension, <b>former</b> <b>President</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> included the Production Tax Credit within a group of tax incentives for businesses. The PTC was extended through 2005 and also expanded the different types of renewable energies that would be included under the bill. The Energy Policy Act of 2005 (H.R. 6) modified the credit and extended it through the end of 2007. In December 2006, the PTC was extended for another year by the Tax Relief and Health Care Act of 2006 (H.R. 6111). President Barack Obama extended the PTC by signing into law the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 (H.R. 1). The Wind PTC was extended an additional two years, expiring the end of 2012, and was then extended as part of the fiscal cliff deal to expire at the end of 2013. In late 2015 authorities provided a 5-year PTC, unlike the usual 1- or 2-year, but phased out by 2020 at a rate of 20% per year. The House voted 316-113, while the Senate voted 65-33. Analysts expect 25 GW more wind power between 2016-18. The Consolidated Appropriations Act, 2016 extended the expiration date for this tax credit to December 31, 2019, for wind facilities commencing construction, with a phase-down beginning for wind projects commencing construction after December 31, 2016. The Act extended the tax credit for other eligible renewable energy technologies commencing construction through December 31, 2016. The Act applies retroactively to January 1, 2015.|$|E

The 11 th September 2001, the United States of America was the victim for terrorist attacks, conducted by Al-Qaeda. Al-Qaeda are allies with Taliban, therefore their base was placed in Afghanistan. Short time after the terrorist attacks conducted towards the U. S., <b>former</b> <b>President</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> declared a war on terror, not only because of self-defence but also to free Afghanistan from the fundamental regime. The attention on Afghanistan was increased by the world society after the invasion was announced. One of the main goals during the invasion in Afghanistan has been the Afghan women’s right. Both, <b>former,</b> <b>President</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> and his wife Laura Bush articulated in several statements the “oppression” of the Afghan women under the power of Taliban. In this project we will investigate how this issue was articulated by the Bush administration and if the women’s rights, as the Bush administration advocates them, are compatible with the cultural view on women in Afghanistan. This interest has led us to the following problem formulation: How has the Bush administration articulated Afghan women and women's rights, and is this articulation compatible with the gender relations and cultural view on women and women’s rights in Afghanistan? The collection of empirical data consist of both primary, consisting of interviews, speeches etc., and secondary data, consisting of books, studies etc. on this specific field.

40|$|The post 9 / 11 {{effects were}} manifold, many economies and {{industries}} not only suffered serious losses but also stagnated for years. It {{is safe to}} think that tourism and hospitality experienced {{a decline in the}} international demand and the volume of air passengers. For months, New York was portrayed as an unsafe destination by the media. <b>Former</b> <b>president</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> claimed that traveling inside the country was a way of overcoming the fear of terrorism. Recently, the idea that terrorism affects directly tourism in the long term has been questioned.

To what extent the Middle East is affected by this is the main thesis in Tourism and Muslim World., which contains 21 chapters that address a wide range of complex issues. Not all can be reviewed here, but some are worth particular mention. Boris Vukonic (chapter 3) painstakingly explores the importance of tourism in Middle East, considering previous studies that have focussed on the troublesome encounters between international tourists and locals.

40|$|Throwing a shoe at the President While {{there were}} many reasons for the Republican loss in the 2008 election, one reason was the ridicule poured on <b>former</b> <b>President</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush.</b> Whether by Jon Stewart's The Daily Show (2009) or Will Ferrell (Youtube. com, 2005) impersonations, few could see Bush in any serious light. He had become a comic figure, even tragic, such that a {{journalist}} in Iraq could consider throwing his shoe at him. The story of "most powerful person on the planet " had been transformed into "inept leader. " In the May issue of Time Magazine, Michael Grunwald (2009, 18 - 23) reflects {{on the future of}} the Republican Party and asks, "Is the party over? " Who can take them seriously, he argues, when some of their leaders believe the Earth is cooling.

While the Republican Party may rebound if the Democrats overreach themselves, fail miserably in Pakistan and Afghanistan and if the recession becomes system 2 threatening, right now the terms of the policy debate are being discussed within Democrats ' terms.

The growth of trade was spurred in 1980 when the U. S. extended the Most-Favored-Nation Tariff Preference Treatment (MFN) to China on February 1, 1980. After nearly a decade of experience operating within this regime, the "Tiananmen Square" event of 1989 and its ramifications have led some U. S. Congresspersons to call {{for an end to the}} MFN treatment. <b>Former</b> <b>president</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush</b> resisted these calls and President Clinton has agreed to renew the MFN treatment for another year without any conditions creating a political debate that has transpired with little knowledge of how important MFN treatment is to China and to the U. S. This study empirically estimates the economic importance of U. S. -China MFN treatment thereby providing substance upon which policy discussions and decisions can be based. In pursuit of my goal of empirically establishing the results of the U. S. 's MFN treatment of imports from China, this study has three technical objectives: First, since both import demand and export supply influences determine equilibrium price and quantity, based on the paper by Mendez and Rousslang (1989), simultaneous equation estimating methods have been used when dealing with the "simultaneity" problem that has plagued previous similar studies. Second, based on the fact that sales of imported goods are sensitive to price, disaggregated elasticities of the U. S. import demand for Chinese goods and of China's export supply to the U. S. are estimated by using Edward Leamer' s method (1981). This enables me to avoid "the errors in observation" that have distorted previous, similar studies for other country's trade. Third, instead of focusing on only one country, the estimated elasticities have been used to assess the welfare effects of implementing MFN treatment for both the U. S. and China. In conclusion, these results are analyzed to provide both other scholars and policymakers a better understanding of the costs of terminating MFN treatment of China's exports...|$|E
40|$|A {{striking}} {{characteristic of}} the Clinton era has been an increased American propensity to employ military power as an adjunct of foreign policy. Since ordering a cruise missile attack on an Iraqi intelligence headquarters in Baghdad in June 1993 in retaliation for an alleged plot to assassinate <b>former</b> <b>President</b> <b>George</b> <b>Bush,</b> President Bill Clinton has employed US forces with striking frequency in a remarkable array of circumstances. In 1993, Clinton fought and lost a minor war in Somalia. In 1994, he dispatched US troops to occupy Haiti and reinstall President Jean Bertrand Aristide to power. In 1995, American aircraft provided the preponderance of the combat power for the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (2 ̆ 2 NATO 2 ̆ 2) bombing campaign that paved {{a way for the}} Dayton peace accords ending (or at least suspending) the Bosnian civil war. When NATO peacekeepers entered Bosnia in December of that year, American ground troops were in the vanguard. On a reduced scale, they have remained ever since. That was not all. In 1998, to lend substance to its so-called 2 ̆ 2 war on terrorism, 2 ̆ 2 the Clinton administration launched cruise missile attacks on suspected terrorist base camps in Afghanistan. In Sudan, US missiles also leveled a pharmaceutical plant alleged-incorrectly as it would turn out-to have been used to manufacture materials essential to the production of nerve gas. In the Persian Gulf, Clinton on two occasions directed the Pentagon to mount a show of force, deploying contingents of combat troops to Kuwait on short notice. He has maintained and expanded the air patrols in the 2 ̆ 2 no-fly zones 2 ̆ 2 over northern and southern Iraq, ordered air strikes {{from time to time to}} express displeasure with Saddam Hussein, and in December 1998 launched Operation Desert Fox to punish Iraq for refusing to cooperate with United Nations (2 ̆ 2 UN 2 ̆ 2) weapons inspections. Since Desert Fox, the United States and Great Britain have continued a desultory bombing campaign against Iraq, attacking targets every two or three days for the ostensible purpose of enforcing UN resolutions dating back to the Gulf War of 1990 - 1991. And, of course, a year ago the United States was once again in the forefront of NATO 2 ̆ 7 s efforts to bring Slobodan Milosevic 2 ̆ 7 s Yugoslavia to heel, an initiative that resulted in a massive 78 -day air war and another open-ended commitment of American troops as 2 ̆ 2 peacekeepers 2 ̆ 2 -this time to Kosovo.
