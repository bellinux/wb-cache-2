To achieve the required tension in case of copper core samples (A 1 and B 1), a draft of 1.3 between the front drafting roller and the take-up roller had to be maintained. Since copper has very less elasticity due to its high modulus, this draft during spinning made it permanently elongated, hence the elongation values in the <b>hybrid</b> <b>yarn</b> sample A 1 and B 1 were reduced. This is also reflected in the resultant count of the sample A 1 and B 1 in Table  2. The resultant count of 75 Tex copper wire and 31.60 Tex polyester turned out to be 89.40 Tex only (sample A 1). Similarly, 320.80 Tex copper with 78.52 Tex AW yarn blend in <b>hybrid</b> <b>yarn</b> B 1 was only 354.56 Tex.|$|E

The resultant Tex count of the <b>hybrid</b> <b>yarn</b> increases as shown in Table  2 (A 2 –A 6), but since the diameter of the resultant yarn remains the same, hence various amounts of copper can be adjusted by changing the number of coils in the <b>hybrid</b> <b>yarn</b> structure for improving the electromagnetic shielding efficiency of the resultant fabrics.|$|E

To start, arrays of vertically aligned multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT) are converted into indefinitely long MWNT sheets by drawing.

The process is scalable for yarn fabrication on an industrial scale. Prepared materials are characterized by electron microscopy, electrical, mechanical, and electrochemical measurements. It is found that the electrical conductivity of the composite MWNT-graphene yarns is over 900 S/cm. This value is 400 % and 1250 % higher than electrical conductivity of pristine MWNT yarns or graphene paper, respectively.

The kinetics of the crystallization process, in the dynamic and isothermal regime, was followed by DSC, and the results were analyzed by Avrami, Ozawa, and Harnisch-Muschik methods. Isothermal crystallization of i-PP was carried out at 388 – 400 K, and values for the Avrami exponent ranging from 1. 93 to 4. 39 were determined. The equilibrium melting temperature was determined by the Hoffman-Weeks method, and γ = 2. 54 was found. Double melting peaks were observed both when the crystallization was performed at lower temperatures (isothermal regime) and at higher cooling rates (nonisothermal regime). A single melting peak appeared upon melting following isothermal crystallization at 400 K. The nonisothermal kinetics data showed that the peak crystallization temperature changes from 377 to 386 K as the cooling rate decreases from 20 to 3 K/min. Applying the Ozawa method, a value of the exponent n = 2. 33 was determined, which is in agreement with the results for isothermal crystallization at 391 – 400 K.

With a load adapted material design {{as well as an}} efficient manufacturing concept these properties can be exploited to a full extend.

40|$|In recent years, natural fibre-reinforced polymer {{composites}} {{have been}} attracting {{attention from the}} viewpoint of reducing the impact on the natural environment. Currently, the use of thermoplastic resins in composites is clearly of higher potential than the use of thermoset. There are many thermoplastic polymers derived from renewable raw materials, which are also biodegradable. Polylactic acid (PLA) is one such candidate, and it shows rather good properties that are suitable for applications that do not require long-term durability or elevated mechanical performance at higher temperatures. In order to make their possible use in many technical applications more attractive, the mechanical properties of the PLA can be enhanced by using reinforcements. Hemp fibres can be considered to be a good choice for reinforcing polymer composites, due to their high stiffness, strength, and aspect ratio. Highly ordered textile reinforcements, such as interlaced woven fabrics and unidirectional fabrics made from natural-fibre yarns, perform considerably better than random non-woven mats in natural-fibre composites. At present, the commercially available plant-fibre yarns are not intended for structural composites, but for textiles, which have entirely different demands on the yarns. Thus, work is needed to tailor-make the best plant-fibre yarn for reinforcement of composites. This also includes investigation of the possibility of combining plant-fibre yarns with the matrix polymer in fibre form into one <b>hybrid</b> <b>yarn</b> (a composite preform), and how to do it (twisting or blending). It is well known that fibres provide the highest strength and stiffness when they are continuous and aligned {{in the direction of the}} applied load. Natural fibres are naturally discontinuous and conventional spun staple yarns tend to be highly twisted, which leads to fibre misalignment and poor resin wet-out. The structured natural-fibre composites reported so far are based on twisted yarns produced by long-established conventional spinning methods, mainly ring spinning. In this paper, we report our work on improving the orientation of hemp fibres in composites by using our recent development of co-wrapped yarn structures. This novel co-wrapped yarn consists of low twist and very fine hemp yarns next to PLA filaments in the core part, which are wrapped by PLA filaments. By varying the composition of <b>hybrid</b> <b>yarn,</b> it is possible to vary the hemp fibre content from 10 to 45 wt %. An exciting recent advancement has been a new family of aligned natural-fibre reinforcements, which has overcome these issues by using low twist yarns. We also report the influence of fibre content and wrap density (number of wraps per unit length) on the properties of composites. Before compression moulding, multilayer 0 / 90 bidirectional <b>hybrid</b> <b>yarn</b> prepregs were prepared by winding the <b>hybrid</b> <b>yarn</b> around a steel rectangular frame. We investigated the mechanical and thermo-mechanical properties of hemp-reinforced PLA composites. Compared to neat PLA, the tensile and flexural modulus and the strength of the PLA-hemp composites were significantly higher as a result of the increased fibre content. Impact strength of the composites decreased initially up to 10 wt % fibre loading, but even higher fibre loading caused an improvement in impact strength. From the DMTA results, it is evident that incorporation of the fibres gives a considerable increase in storage modulus and a decrease in tan δ values. These results show the reinforcing effect of hemp on PLA matrix. From the general trend in the results obtained, it can be affirmed that co-wrapped <b>hybrid</b> <b>yarn</b> with lower wrapping density leads to lower mechanical properties in the composite. The study performed with DSC revealed that the glass transition temperature and the crystalline melting point of PLA were not affected significantly after reinforcement with hemp. The crystallisation temperature of the hemp-reinforced PLA composites decreased compared to pure PLA, which indicates that the hemp fibres hinder the migration and diffusion of PLA molecular chains to the surface of the nucleus in the composites. No noteworthy differences in calorimetric data from DSC for composites were observed between the <b>hybrid</b> <b>yarn</b> preforms with different wrapping density. Future work will concentrate on efforts to evaluate the biodegradability of these developing and promising composites...|$|E

The applications of <b>hybrid</b> <b>yarns</b> facilitate short flow paths of the matrix systems and thus comparatively low impregnation and consolidation pressures. These process conditions are beneficial for the integration of functional elements as sensors and electronic components in fibre-reinforced thermoplastic parts. Nevertheless, to minimize the strain on these elements during the pressing process, especially in thin-walled components, an adapted lay-up has to be examined. For the variation of the single layer thicknesses the material is excavated in the integration relevant area by a remote laser cutting process. Since high intensities are needed to enable laser cutting of glass-fibre textiles a brilliant laser beam source is recommended. Thereby, the remote-technology is used to deflect the beam onto the material with tiltable scanning mirrors. Furthermore, a precise positioning of the laser cutting pathis required. For this reason a camera positioning system is used to detect the working area of the scanner system. Subsequently, the certain work piece features can be extracted by image processing algorithms. The determined data {{is used for the}} cutting path generation. Since the cutting process is a thermal process, it is necessary to minimize the heat affected zone to a minimum. Therefore, a tailored remote laser cutting strategy was developed. This strategy allows an ablation of the hybrid and the knitting yarn to achieve a full cut or a partial exposure of single layers. Within this work, the enhancement of integration possibilities of sensor elements in thin-walled components will be presented under the focus of locally cut and partial exposed layers of the multi-layer knitted fabrics...|$|R

Furthermore, this paper will give an outlook on future applications regarding fiber-metal laminates...|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{muscles are}} of {{practical}} interest, but few types have been commercially exploited. Typical problems include slow response, low strain and force generation, short cycle life, use of electrolytes, and low energy efficiency. We have designed guest-filled, twist-spun carbon nanotube yarns as electrolyte-free muscles that provide fast, high-force, large-stroke torsional and tensile actuation. More {{than a million}} torsional and tensile actuation cycles are demonstrated, wherein a muscle spins a rotor at an average 11, 500 revolutions/minute or delivers 3 % tensile contraction at 1200 cycles/minute. Electrical, chemical, or photonic excitation of <b>hybrid</b> <b>yarns</b> changes guest dimensions and generates torsional rotation and contraction of the yarn host. Demonstrations include torsional motors, contractile muscles, and sensors that capture {{the energy of the}} sensing process to mechanically actuate. Theconcept of deploying strong carbon nano-tube yarns as actuators has produced bothelectrochemically and thermally powered yarn muscles. The performance of electrochemically powered yarnmuscles (1, 2) is adversely affected for most applications by the need for electrolyte, counter electrode, and device packaging, which add much more to actuator weight and volume than the actuat...|$|R
40|$|Textile {{reinforced}} concrete (TRC) is an innovative composite material, {{which is being}} intensely and practice-oriented investigated on national and international level. In {{the last few years}} this material has gained increasing importance in the field of civil engineering. In the context of the collaborative research project SFB 532 at the RWTH Aachen University, research was carried out to understand and to predict the behaviour of different yarn structures in fine grained concrete. Based on the results, innovative commingling yarns were made of alkali-resistant glass fibres and water soluble PVA. These <b>hybrid</b> <b>yarns</b> have an open structure, which improves the penetration of the textile reinforcement by the concrete matrix. Hence, the load bearing capacity of TRC structural elements was significantly improved. This paper presents a technique for the production of such commingling yarns for concrete applications. The mechanical properties of the new yarns are determined due to tensile stress tests. The bond behaviour of the commingling yarns was investigated by pull-out- and tensile stress tests on TRC-specimens. The results of the different tests are being presented and briefly discussed...|$|R
