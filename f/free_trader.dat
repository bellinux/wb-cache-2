5|$|Following {{the success}} of the referendum, Walker was {{encouraged}} to stand for the Senate by a petition of over 6500 signatures. A staunch <b>free</b> <b>trader,</b> Walker campaigned as part of the Free Trade Party's endorsed ticket. He had resigned as president of the Bank of New South Wales in 1897, but remained a director. At the first federal election in March 1901, Walker was elected as a New South Wales Senator {{at the head of the}} poll.|$|E

He {{was a member of the}} New South Wales Legislative Council from 1899 until his election to the Australian Senate as a <b>Free</b> <b>Trader</b> from New South Wales at the first federal election in 1901. Millen led the conservative parties in the Senate from 1907 until shortly before his death in 1923.|$|E
5|$|In 1882, Gould {{was elected}} to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly as the member for Patrick's Plains (renamed Singleton in 1894). Initially an {{opponent}} of the coalition associated with Henry Parkes and John Robertson, he later supported Robertson's government in 1885. By 1887 he was supporting his career with his own legal practice in Singleton and Sydney, and when the party system came into being in New South Wales in that year he identified as a <b>Free</b> <b>Trader.</b> In 1889 he was appointed Minister for Justice under Parkes, serving until 1891; he held the position again under George Reid from 1894 to 1898. During the first period of his ministry he became involved in a dispute with the Chief Justice, Sir Frederick Darley, over requests for improved court accommodation and a contested punishment for contempt of two witnesses. Despite embarrassing his premier, he remained close with Parkes throughout his state career and in later years frequently gave speeches in his memory.|$|E

In September 1888 he presided over a meeting at Redfern Town Hall to support the ultimately-unsuccessful candidacy of <b>free</b> <b>trader</b> John Martin for a by-election to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly seat of Redfern; the meeting was attended by Sir Henry Parkes who also spoke in support.|$|E

25|$|Beveridge {{strongly}} aligned {{himself with}} the politics of Parkes and later stood for the seat of Redfern himself as a Free Trade candidate at the 1889 colonial election, but was unsuccessful, missing out {{by a margin of}} over 100 votes, despite the overall success of the Free Trade movement at that election, with Parkes forming government. Even so, on 12 June 1890 he was appointed to the Redfern Sub-District Public School Board by the Governor Lord Carrington, on the advice of <b>Free</b> <b>Trader</b> Minister for Public Instruction, Joseph Carruthers.|$|E
25|$|Throughout his {{political}} career, Amery was an exponent of Imperial unity, {{as he saw}} the British Empire as a force for justice and progress in the world. He strongly supported {{the evolution of the}} dominions into independent nations bound to Britain by ties of kinship, trade, defence and a common pride in the Empire. He also supported the gradual evolution of the colonies, particularly India, to the same status, unlike Churchill, a <b>free</b> <b>trader,</b> who was less interested in the Empire as such and more in Britain itself as a great power. Amery felt that Britain itself was too weak to maintain its great power position.|$|E

On 27 August 1898, Lee rose to become Minister of Justice in the <b>Free</b> <b>Trader</b> government of George Reid, introducing prison libraries, lights in prison cells and nightdresses for female prisoners. He served in this capacity until his promotion on 3 July 1899 as the Secretary for Public Works. He served in this capacity only briefly when on 13 September 1899, Reid's government fell to William Lyne's Protectionists. He sat on the royal commission on city railway extension in 1897.|$|E

The once-proud association met its decline in power after a very strong Bureau fleet, {{with the help of the}} Guild of <b>Free</b> <b>Traders,</b> organized an attack on the association.

500|$|Walker {{was born}} in Scotland but spent his early {{childhood}} in New South Wales, before returning to Scotland {{with his family to}} study finance. Joining the Bank of New South Wales, he returned to Australia and held various financial positions in New South Wales and Queensland. Gaining a public reputation for financial expertise, he was active in the Federationist cause and was a delegate to the 1897 Constitutional Convention, where he was a significant figure in the development of Commonwealth finance schemes. After assisting the successful [...] "Yes" [...] campaign for the 1898 referendum, {{he was elected to the}} Senate in 1901 as a <b>Free</b> <b>Trader.</b>|$|E
500|$|At {{the first}} federal {{election}} in March 1901, Pulsford was elected as a senator for New South Wales in the sixth and final position, narrowly defeating fellow <b>Free</b> <b>Trader</b> John Gray. He continued his fervent support of free trade {{and was one of}} the few senators to oppose the White Australia policy, describing [...] "the whole of the inhabitants of Asia as [...] friends". He opposed the 1901 Immigration Restriction Act, supported Asians' eligibility for the old-age pension, and decried the treatment of Kanaka labourers as [...] "cattle". In his opposition to immigration restriction he highlighted the diplomatic insult to Japan and other Asian nations, and published a pamphlet in 1905 supporting the protestations of the Japanese government against the policy.|$|E
500|$|Following Federation, Gould contested {{the first}} federal {{election}} in March 1901, standing for the Senate as a <b>Free</b> <b>Trader.</b> He was elected in the third of six positions, entitling him to a six-year term. His first speech was largely devoted to his impassioned support for free trade, and in his early years as a senator he also supported decentralisation and opposed proposals to establish a federal capital. A supporter of the White Australia policy, he expressed concern over Kanaka labour in Queensland, although his assumption that the arrangement was temporary enabled his pragmatism on this issue. Gould was also involved in defence matters, supporting the introduction of conscription and maintaining loyalty to the Empire, where [...] "there are men much more experienced in the principles of government than we are". At the 1906 election, Gould was easily re-elected in the first position, winning the largest vote for any senator to that time.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Free</b> <b>Traders</b> (their {{official}} {{title was}} [...] "Australian Free Trade and Liberal Association") advocated {{the dismantling of}} the tariff system, a transcontinental railway, and believed that aged pensions should be left to the states. As many of the policies of the Protectionists and <b>Free</b> <b>Traders</b> were similar, the <b>Free</b> <b>Traders</b> campaigned heavily on tariffs, with Reid stating that he wanted the election to be a plebiscite on tariffs. The party used the colour blue throughout the campaign. In addition to Reid, who believed he should have been appointed Prime Minister instead of Barton as he considered himself the bigger political figure, Free Trade candidates included Reid's unofficial deputy Paddy Glynn, William Irvine, and former state Labour leader and future Commonwealth Liberal Party Prime Minister Joseph Cook.|$|R

Tasmania elected five members, each elector casting one vote: three <b>Free</b> <b>Traders</b> (Edward Braddon, 26.2%; Norman Cameron, 11.6%; Frederick Piesse, 10.1%), one Protectionist (Philip Fysh, 9.9%) and one Labour member (King O'Malley, 21.9%).|$|R
500|$|In {{the dispute}} between {{protection}} and free trade {{that formed the}} backbone of Australian colonial politics {{in the late nineteenth}} century, O'Connor was a committed protectionist. Despite this, Sir Henry Parkes, the Premier of New South Wales and a <b>free</b> <b>trader,</b> had him appointed to the New South Wales Legislative Council on 8 February 1888. The protectionist George Dibbs appointed him Minister for Justice on 23 October 1891, a position in which he worked closely with his friend Barton, who was Attorney General. O'Connor also served as Solicitor General from 19 July to 13 September 1893. In these portfolios he worked for electoral reform and supported the cause of Federation. After becoming Leader of the Government in the Legislative Council in 1892 he exercised considerable control over that body, but his influence was greatly diminished after he and Barton were forced to resign from the ministry on 14 December 1893, [...] having accepted briefs in a case in which they were required to argue against the railway commissioners, a government department. O'Connor remained in the Legislative Council but embarked on an overseas tour, travelling to Egypt, Italy, England and Ireland.|$|E

He was again supported by the Conservatives in the 1929 general election, but in one of the shock results of the election, lost his seat by 5,029 votes to Herbert Gibson, the Labour candidate. Hopkinson kept up his contribution of articles expressing unorthodox thoughts to journals while out of Parliament, blaming the Wall Street Crash of 1929 on an American attempt to restrict imports.|$|E

They have many secret bases scattered in Federation space, and commonly do strikes and raids among traders and merchants. They do not use civilian ships, and instead they use Association ships that are heavily upgraded.

5000|$|For some {{parliamentary}} leaders, like John Bright, Richard Cobden and Charles Pelham Villiers, {{the repeal}} of tariffs on imported corn was not enough. They wished to reduce the tariffs on all imported consumer products. These parliamentary leaders became known as [...] "free traders". The repeal of the corn laws irrevocably split the Tory/Conservative party. The Peelites were not <b>free</b> <b>traders,</b> but both the Peelites and the <b>free</b> <b>traders</b> were originally Tories. Thus both the <b>free</b> <b>traders</b> and the Peelites tended {{to side with the}} Whigs against the Tories on international trade issues. This presented a real threat to any government the Tories attempted to form. The effect of this split was felt in the election of July-August 1847, when the Whig party won a 53.8% majority of seats in the Parliament. The Whigs knew that they could count on the Peelite Conservatives when an international trade issue came before Parliament. In June 1852, the effects of the split in the Tory/Conservative party was having even more effect.|$|R

The name was chosen {{as it had been}} use by the former Ewo Hong run by Chinese merchant Howqua, a business with an impeccable reputation. The firms operations included smuggling opium into China from Malwa, India, trading spices and sugar with the Philippines, exporting Chinese tea and silk to England, factoring and insuring cargo, renting out dockyard facilities and warehouse space, trade financing and other numerous lines of business and trade. In 1834, Parliament ended the monopoly of the British East India Company on trade between Britain and China. Jardine, Matheson and Company took this opportunity to fill the vacuum left by the East India Company. With its first voyage carrying Raw Silk, but ironically no tea, the ship [...] "Sarah" [...] (now owned by Thomas Weeding, but previously owned in partnership by Weeding, Jardine and Cowasjee) left for England, becoming the first <b>free</b> <b>trader</b> to arrive in England after the monopoly ceased.
