The German legislation on <b>dietetic</b> <b>foods</b> (Verordnung über diätetische Lebensmittel) defines which regulations these foods are subject to. In Germany, the current discussion {{focuses on the}} removal of the regulation for specific <b>dietetic</b> <b>foods</b> for diabetics and to replace the obligation to label carbohydrate exchanges with a uniform European nutrition labelling on packaged foods. BfR has already stated in several opinions that in terms of nutritional physiology, diabetic foods which, for example, advertise with a low glycaemic index, are unnecessary. In addition, the Institute is working on recommendations for standardised nutrition labelling. In light of recent discussion, the present BfR opinion asses whether the aspired alterations are contrary to the special dietary needs of individuals with a glucose metabolism disorder. Specifically in its opinion on the Jenkins study (BfR, 2009), BfR already looked into the current study results from 2008 - 2009. In the present opinion, the Institute assesses the international study results from 2002 - 2007. BfR again concludes that a diet with a low glycaemic index does not necessitate any special dietary requirements for diabetics since the vast amount of study results lead to different conclusions. This result corresponds to the draft of an EFSA opinion published just recently. The concept of carbohydrate exchanges (BE or KE) is unique in Germany, Austria and Switzerland. Yet the concept offers no precisely defined values but rather provides estimated units that are applied differently in each country. Many European diabetes associations are thus asking for uniform and extended nutrition labelling on packaged foods...|$|R

40|$|The {{interest}} on oligosaccharides such as fructo-oligosaccharides (FOS) has strongly increased {{in recent years}} for food and pharmaceutical applications, mainly due to their improved technological and functional properties. FOS can be produced by fermentative processes from sucrose, {{and can be found}} in mixture with other mono- and di-saccharides and salts, {{at the end of the}} process [1]. Unlike FOS, the small saccharides (SGF), namely fructose, glucose and sucrose in the mixture, are known to be cariogenic, caloric and do not present prebiotic activity. The purification of FOS from the other sugars can represent and important increment on the economic value of the final product, which can be further used in diabetic and <b>dietetic</b> <b>food</b> [2]. Different strategies have been developed for this purpose, including microbial treatment [3], ultra and nano-filtration, activated charcoal systems [4], or ion-exchange chromatography [5]. Ion exchange resins may be then used in batch or continuous chromatographic processes, as Simulated Moving Bed (SMB) chromatography, to purify sugars. A screening of different commercial resins was previously done in order to select the most suitable to separate the oligosaccharides [5]. The resin Diaion 535 Ca showed an increased recovery yield and purity of FOS (92 and 90 %, respectively). In the present work, the separation process was implemented in the SMB, using the selected resin, namely. Equilibrium adsorption isotherms were determined by the Retention Time Method (RTM), for each single sugar. The resin was afterwards packed in eight SMB columns, and tested in the pilot plant. Different operation parameters, including switching time, extra time, internal flow-rates and operating pump flow-rates for feed, raffinate, desorbent, eluent and recycling streams, were tested in the plant. The separation of fructose from glucose and FOS from the SGF was evaluated. Firstly, the separation of a binary sugar mixture of fructose/sucrose (~ 50 / 50 %) was performed followed by the separation of FOS from a fermentative broth. Fructose was purified from 53 to 76 % and sucrose from 47 to 77 %. FOS and SGF were purified from 50 to 67 %. The implementation of UV detectors between the SMB columns allowed following the sugar concentration profile online during the separation process.

The manufacturers recommend a daily long-term dose in the gram range although {{the safety of a}} cinnamon dose of this amount has not yet been demonstrated. Furthermore, the claimed ability of cinnamon to reduce blood sugar has not been sufficiently proven up to now. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) was, therefore, asked to assess the daily intake of high amounts of cinnamon from the angle of consumer health protection. Small amounts of cinnamon have been used for thousands of years as a spice without any reports of side effects. By contrast, no reliable data are available on the effects of the daily continuous administration of amounts in the gram range. When it comes to cinnamon a distinction must be made between Ceylon and cassia cinnamon. Unlike cassia cinnamon Ceylon cinnamon hardly contain any coumarin which – when ingested in large amounts – can cause damage to the liver. BfR fundamentally believes that cinnamon products to reduce blood sugar should be classed as medicinal products and not as food supplements.

Banana peel was used as a substrate for xylitol production. Hydrolysate was detoxified by neutralization, activated charcoal treatment and vacuum evaporation. Effect of pH was tested for C. tropicalis at three different levels and pH value of 2. 5 was found to be the best; producing 24. 7 g L- 1 xylitol. Rusks were prepared by replacing sucrose with xylitol at different levels. Physicochemical analysis of rusks at different intervals of storage i. e. 0, 10, 20 and 30 days was carried out. Hardness decreased significantly (P< 0. 05) from the treatment having 100 % sucrose (4, 950. 6 g) to 100 % xylitol (3, 090. 3 g) upon replacing sucrose with xylitol, while fracturability value increased from 71. 90 to 74. 26 mm for the treatment containing 100 % xylitol. Color value and water activity of rusks increased significantly with the replacement of sucrose with xylitol. The increase in moisture content and decreasing trend in other parameters with storage were observed in rusks. Xylitol has low calorific value as compared to sucrose so it can be incorporated into <b>dietetic</b> <b>foods</b> which may help in controlling sugar level in diabetic patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{recommendations}} {{for a healthy}} diet for the general population now also apply to diabetics. For years a strict diet with a ban on sugar and the exact counting of bread units (BUs) {{was part of the}} daily life of diabetics. In order {{to make it easier for}} diabetics to comply with their diet instructions, industry developed special foods for them. A study indicates that today almost 50 % of diabetics regularly consume special diabetic products although they are no longer recommended by scientific circles. For a long time diabetics had to strictly control the sugar in their food or replace it with sugar substitutes like fructose. However, diabetes is not just a disease which changes the sugar balance; it likewise involves disruptions of protein and fat metabolism. Hence treatment that only regulates sugar balance is not adequate. People suffering from type 2 diabetes in particular are afflicted by metabolic disorders long before the disease is diagnosed. In order to prevent the disease or to treat it later, individual food patterns must be changed. This includes things like the daily consumption of fresh fruit and vegetables because these foods contain a great deal of roughage in addition to antioxidative substances. In contrast, special diabetic foods are not necessary. Against this backdrop BfR believes that special provisions for diabetic food are no longer necessary. Reduced sugar foods should not, therefore, be sold as <b>dietetic</b> <b>foods.</b> According to current scientific knowledge there are no criteria which justify this classification. For the above-mentioned disease all the claims on food like “suitable for diabetics” should be removed...|$|R
40|$|Sorbitol is a hexahydroxy alcohol {{used as a}} sugar {{substitute}} in many <b>dietetic</b> <b>foods</b> and as a drug vehicle. Previous {{studies have suggested that}} sorbitol ingestion may be an additional cause of non-specific gastrointestinal distress. We evaluated sorbitol malabsorption in 30 healthy volunteers, seven patients with untreated coeliac disease and nine patients with coeliac disease on a gluten free diet, using a four hour H 2 breath test. After ingestion of test solutions containing sorbitol 10 and 20 g and of four sweets (6. 8 g sorbitol), 90 %, 100 %, and 62 % of healthy volunteers, respectively had significantly raised H 2 excretion, indicating malabsorption of sorbitol. Of all healthy subjects tested, 45 % after 10 g, 100 % after 20 g, and 50 % after four sweets complained of symptoms of carbohydrate intolerance during the eight hours after sorbitol. After a 5 g dose given at concentrations of 2 %, 4 %, 8 %, 16 %, malabsorption was shown in 10 %, 12 %, 22 %, and 43 % of the healthy volunteers. Symptoms of intolerance at 5 g were experienced only at concentrations of 8 % and 16 %. Unlike healthy volunteers and coeliac patients on a gluten free diet, 100 % of untreated coeliacs malabsorbed a 2 % solution of 5 g sorbitol. These results show that malabsorption and intolerance of sorbitol may result from ingestion of doses and/or concentrations usually found in many foods and drugs; they underline the need to consider this as a possible and hitherto underestimated cause of gastrointestinal symptoms...|$|R

40|$|Products on {{the basis}} of soya protein are sold on the market as an {{alternative}} to animal protein. Vegetarians and consumers, who wish to benefit from the health-promoting effects of soya, tend to opt for soya products as do consumers with a cow milk intolerance. However, what is perhaps a good alternative for adults is not necessarily a good one for infants. Infant formula and follow-up formula based on soya protein are foods for the special nutrition of infants and, in their capacity as <b>dietetic</b> <b>foods,</b> are governed by specific provisions. In contrast, soya drinks are not infant foods but are foods for general consumption. As such they are not specifically tailored to the needs of infants and are not suitable for them. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) comments in this Opinion on the questions of the administration of soya-based infant formula and follow-up formula as a substitute for cow milk based infant formula. Soya beans naturally contain relatively high concentrations of isoflavones. The impact of the elevated, long-term intake of isoflavones on infants has not yet been definitively elucidated. For precautionary reasons BfR backs the recommendation of the Nutrition Committee of the German Society of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine (DGJK) until further data become available. According to this, infant formula made of soya protein is not a substitute for cow milk products. Infants who are not breastfed or who are not exclusively breastfed should only be given this regularly in substantiated exceptional cases and following a recommendation by a doctor. Soya food is not suitable as a diet for healthy infants...|$|R

40|$|Milk drinks {{for young}} children, i. e. toddlers, {{available}} on the market {{are referred to as}} toddler milk or children’s milk. The manufacturers of these products often advertise these to be – in contrast to cow milk – adjusted to serve the specific nutritional needs of young children. These products thus often contain less protein than cow milk, allegedly in order to counteract obesity later in life. Instead they contain more vitamins and minerals, which is then said to be necessary for the adequate mental development of young children. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) has reached the conclusion that these milk products for young children are not adjusted for the special nutritional needs of children ages one to three years. These therefore do not fulfil the requirements of the German regulation of <b>dietetic</b> <b>foods.</b> On the contrary, since numerous milk drinks for young children are enriched with nearly all vitamins and minerals, they actually contribute to the uncontrolled increased intake of nutri-ents in young children. On the other hand, they contain relatively lower amounts of micronu-trients than those, for example of calcium and vitamin B 2, contained in cow milk. Whether a reduced concentration of protein in milk drinks for young children as compared to that in cow milk leads to significantly reduced protein intake per day is questionable. Furthermore, the scientific evidence to indicate that reduced protein intake during early childhood will reduce the risk of overweight and obesity in later childhood is insufficient at present. In addition, the fat content in milk drinks for young children, which is approximately comparable to that of whole milk, does not correspond to recommendations by paediatricians and nutritional physi-cians, who recommend that children drink milk with a reduced fat content...|$|R
