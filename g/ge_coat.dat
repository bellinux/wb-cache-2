In this thesis, we develop a series of highly pervious liquid target designs with mean diffusion paths several orders of magnitude less than traditional, pool-type, liquid targets. Experiments have been performed to identify materials (substrates) capable of suspending, through wetting, very thin layers of liquid Ge. Four candidate Ge-substrate target systems have been designed, and (69) As production may be significantly increased over previous targets. The target systems designed include liquid <b>Ge</b> <b>coated</b> onto an: (1) inclined W plane, (2) a long thin Mo wire birdsnest, (3) a SiC weave, and (4) SiC coated C foam. A universal Ta target holder coupling the target to an ion source has also been designed and features a cooled re-circulating baffle for testing {{of each of the}} above target concepts. The results of long-term heating tests on the Mo wire birdsnest show its lifetime to be less than 100 hours; however, future online tests of short duration will test (69) As production for the birdsnested target.

To prepare the samples for TEM observation, the NRs were dispersed via the ethanol solution. A small droplet of the solution was then dropped onto the copper TEM grid. To prepare the samples for cross-section TEM observation, the saw-like edged NRs were dispersed via ethanol solution onto <b>Ge</b> substrates <b>coated</b> with 30 nm of Au film.

40|$|We {{reveal the}} {{mechanism}} of Ge nanoparticles (NPs) formation {{on the surface of}} the hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) deposited by Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapor Deposition (PECVD) on ITO and a on boron doped nanocrystalline diamond (BDD).

The Ge NPs were characterized by Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and high resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM). The nanocrystalline Ge particles are conglomerates of nanocrystals of size 10 - 15 nm and quantum dots (QDs) with size below 2 nm embedded in amorphous <b>Ge</b> phase.

40|$|Amorphous {{hydrogenated}} carbon (a-C:H) is {{a suitable}} material for durable anti-reflection coatings on Ge infrared windows. For the present investigations a-C:H-films were deposited onto single crystal Ge substrates using a RF glow discharge sustained by benzene vapour. The rain erosion {{resistance of the}} samples was tested by using a rotating arm device. The rain erosion caused an optical degradation of the samples, which was characterized by the infrared optical transmission loss at 10 Mym. The erosion behaviour strongly depended on the impact velocity and the impact angle. The a-C:H <b>coated</b> <b>Ge</b> samples always showed a higher rain erosion resistance than the uncoated reference samples.

The <b>Ge</b> MIRE was <b>coated</b> with PEM by sequentially injecting the polycations and polyanions at 0.3  ml/min {{by means of a}} peristaltic pump and leaving them to adsorb without flow for 10  min. Subsequently unbound polymers were rinsed off the surface by pumping HEPES/NaCl buffer at flow rate of 0.3  ml/min for 5  min. The reference chambers were charged with HEPES/NaCl buffer (0.3  ml/min) throughout the entire experiment. SBSR FTIR spectra were recorded after the rinsing step without applying flow.

40|$|The {{structural}} and electronic properties of germanene <b>coated</b> <b>Ge</b> 2 Pt clusters have been determined by {{scanning tunneling microscopy}} and spectroscopy at room temperature. The interior of the germanene sheet exhibits a buckled honeycomb structure with a lattice constant of 4. 3 [*]Å and a buckling of 0. 2 [*]Å. The zigzag edges of germanene are reconstructed and display a 4 × periodicity. The differential conductivity of {{the interior of the}} germanene sheet has a V-shape, which is reminiscent of the density of states of a two-dimensional Dirac system. The minimum of the differential conductivity is located close to the Fermi level and has a non-zero value, which we ascribe to the metallic character of the underlying Ge 2 Pt substrate. Near the reconstructed germanene zigzag edges the shape of the differential conductivity changes from a V-shape to a more parabolic-like shape, revealing that the reconstructed germanene zigzag edges do not exhibit a pronounced metallic edge state...|$|R
40|$|Silica {{nanowires}} {{have recently}} been grown via the vapor-liquid-solid growth mechanism where the vapor precursor is obtained directly from the substrate via active oxidation processes. In this study, we extend this technique to the Ge-O system and show that Au <b>coated</b> <b>Ge</b> substrates {{can be used as}} a volatile GeO source, resulting in germania nanowire formation above 550 o C. The process is highly dependent on Au and native oxide thickness’, the partial pressure of O 2 and annealing temperature. If the oxide layer is too thick, the bare wafer is protected from the active oxidation process. However, if the oxide layer is too thin, it will be readily decomposed leaving no stable surface for nanowires to grow and only an etched surface is observed. In this study we show that a native Ge oxide is unstable and that a thicker oxide is required as a buffer layer, separating active oxidation and nanowire nucleation processes. We also show that nanowires can be grown on stable oxide particles present on the Ge wafer surface...|$|R
40|$|In {{metallic}} contamination analysis of semiconductor wafers, preconcentration {{methods such as}} vapor phase decomposition-droplet collection (VPD-DC) or droplet sandwich etch (DSE) are combined with sensitive analytical techniques, often total-reflection X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (TXRF). Previously we have reported about the occurrence of TXRF saturation effects {{in the analysis of}} microdroplet residues from these methods and identified the origin as a mass-absorption effect of primary X-rays. In this study, different approaches to deal with TXRF saturation effects in semiconductor applications are evaluated. Corrective approaches are tested for the application of VPD-DC-TXRF on Si wafers. The application of correction factors resulted in an overestimation of the effect of 20 %. Internal standardization approaches did not perform well because of the separation of the internal standard element apart from the analytes during the drying step. We suggest another internal approach using the intensity of scattered primary X-rays as an indicator for accuracy. The parameters in a Ge matrix removal method have been investigated. The application of the method on samples from the DSE method on spin <b>coated</b> <b>Ge</b> wafers resulted in efficiencies at 100 % compared to only 40 % without matrix removal. Finally, the use of nanoliter deposition or ink-jet spray methods is proposed to extend the dynamic range of TXRF on microdroplet residues. This suggestion is motivated with calculations based on a mass-absorption model and with experimental results from the study of linearity of TXRF on Ni spin coated Si wafers and the related morphology of the surface species. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{strategy}} is presented for sensitive detection of alfa-fetoprotein (AFP), using a horseradish peroxidase (HRP) -functionalized Envision antibody complex (EVC) as the label. The Envision-AFP signal antibody copolymer (EVC-AFP Ab 2) {{was composed of}} a dextran amine skeleton anchoring more than 100 molecules of HRP and 15 molecules of secondary antibody, and acted as a signal tag in the immunosensor. The sensor was constructed using the following steps: First, gold electrode (GE) was modified with nano-gold (AuNPs) by electro-deposition in HAuCl 4 solution. The high affinity of the AuNPs surface facilitates direct formation of a self-assembled thiolated protein G layer. Next, the <b>coated</b> <b>GE</b> was incubated in a solution of AFP capture antibody (AFP Ab 1); these antibodies attach to the thiolated protein G layer through their non-antigenic regions, leaving the antigen binding sites for binding of target analyte. Following a sandwich immunoreaction, an EVC-AFP Ab 2 -AFP-AFP Ab 1 immunocomplex was formed on the electrode surface, allowing large amounts of HRP on the complex to produce an amplified electrocatalytic current of hydroquinone (HQ) {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2). Highly amplified detection was achieved, with a detection limit of 2 pg/mL and a linear range of 0. 005 &# 8211; 0. 2 ng/mL for AFP in 10 &# 956;L undiluted serum; this is near or below the normal levels of most cancer biomarker proteins in human serum. Measurements of AFP in the serum of cancer patients correlated strongly with standard enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays. These easily fabricated EVC-modified immunosensors show excellent promise for future fabrication of bioelectronic arrays. By varying the target biomolecules, this technique may be easily extended for use with other immunoassays, and thus represents a versatile design route...|$|R
