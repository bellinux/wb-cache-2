2500|$|Testifying {{before the}} US Congress, the Deputy Legal Advisor of the US State Department, George Aldrich said the Indonesians [...] "were armed roughly 90 percent with our equipment. ... {{we really did}} not know very much. Maybe {{we did not want}} to know very much but <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> for a time we did not know." [...] Indonesia was never {{informed}} of the supposed US [...] "aid suspension". David T. Kenney, Country Officer for Indonesia in the US State Department, also testified before Congress that one purpose for the arms was [...] "to keep that area [...] peaceful." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{interest}} me," [...] he murmured. [...] "From {{what you}} say, <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> your material prosperity {{has been somewhat}} dearly bought." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I did not buy {{an evening}} paper," [...] he remarked. [...] "Your face {{tells me the}} news, of course. <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> Starling has been arrested." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> the old feudal spirit still glowed to {{some extent}} in Mr Abney's bosom.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not speak}} for a moment. <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> he was pondering over the new development.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> he was {{meaning to}} convey {{that he had}} {{considered}} my proposition, but regretted his inability to entertain it.|$|R
6000|$|... "From the {{testimony}} of the accuser <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> he found this money in a road more than two years ago. Correct me, sir, if I misunderstood you." ...|$|E
6000|$|But all the neighbours, {{great and}} small, [...] Complained of both with grievous tone. From which <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> we all [...] See other's faults and not our own.|$|E
60|$|Lady, lady neat Of the roguish eye, Wherefore dost thou hie, Stealthy, {{down the}} street, On well-booted feet? From French novels <b>I</b> <b>Gather</b> <b>that</b> you fly, Guy or Jules to meet.|$|E
6000|$|... “One wouldn’t imagine {{so after}} what I discovered. But <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> Evans had been seized {{in this way}} during your watch before.” ...|$|R
60|$|She spoke {{slightly}} angrily and contemptuously of them, rather protectively of me. So <b>that</b> vaguely <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> {{they were}} not quite 'respectable'.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah! <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> kicking {{was in the}} wind, Major. Sir Robert Aylward, Bart., he {{also was}} kicked out, but by smaller toe." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, we {{go wrong}} when we don't go right. That's just it, {{we must go}} some way. And I'm sure, from what <b>I</b> <b>gather,</b> <b>that</b> she isn't wholly {{satisfied}} with Syndicalism." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hum! You {{make out}} so good {{a case for}} him that one might almost believe you {{instructed}} by the gentleman himself. Yet <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> nothing has since been heard of him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell 'em it's all right, Crump, {{and that}} there's no call for any fuss. From their manner <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> I {{am no longer}} needed on this throne. Ask them if that's right?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Another voice echoed, [...] "Podgie!" [...] {{and from}} its note <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> Mr. Carteret-Jones had a reputation, {{but not for}} {{independent}} command.|$|R
6000|$|She {{listened to}} me, as I thought not without anxiety, from which <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> she too feared for my mind. It was not so, however, for she said: ...|$|R
60|$|Gradually, however, it {{subsided}} {{and from}} the last few utterances before quiet was restored <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> Steele had intruded upon {{some kind of a}} meeting in the hall.|$|R
6000|$|... "But surely, when he {{proposed}} to you, he must have given you an inkling of the truth. He only hinted at it {{when he spoke to}} me, but <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> he was eloquent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe so. I {{never heard}} so many nibbles at slang {{from any of}} you five, as from the Rector of Compton {{in the last five}} minutes. <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> he is {{slightly}} bothered." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We've a {{good deal}} of power," [...] Bright ruminated, [...] "but it seems to me you're {{inclined}} to stretch it. <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> the others want him delivered up. We can't act against them." ...|$|E
60|$|From {{the fact}} that his only {{response}} to the question was to leap over the bench and make a grab at me, <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> his mind was not on haggis.|$|R
60|$|All unruffled by this act, {{from which}} <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> Yvonne the strong had tutored Geneviève the frail {{concerning}} me, I consigned my horse to a groom of the château, and linked arms with Andrea.|$|R
6000|$|... "Fighting {{for your}} life, son!" [...] said Lysbeth astonished. [...] "Why, from what Elsa {{has just been}} telling us, <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> the rascals ran away at the first blow which you struck with your staff." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And now you {{probably}} know {{a good deal about}} me," [...] she remarked, with a rather sad smile. [...] "I have been married nine years. <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> you know my husband by name and repute." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "From {{what you}} have said, <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> you are Monsieur Marius de Condillac," [...] said he. [...] "I, {{as you may have}} heard me {{announced}} by your servant, am Martin Marie Rigobert de Garnache--at your service." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is a {{sufficient}} reason," [...] answered the official. [...] "Now, gentlemen, <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> {{some of you}} have benefited by this scheme. If {{you have any information}} to give me, I shall be pleased to hear it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was rather}} {{lucky to get}} it at that. There was an {{anonymous}} bidder who fortunately hadn't got the cash with him, or <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> {{he was willing to}} go to a great deal more." ...|$|R
6000|$|But <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> {{she would}} require a little time before she could be natural. Blome seemed {{to have more of}} an eye for Sally than for Diane. [...] "Do you like Pecos?" [...] he asked Sally.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> {{this must}} be the police, and waited. In the {{impending}} inquiry I was by way of being a star witness. If any one had been in the thick of things from the beginning it was myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{so could}} I--from which <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> in all {{probability}} it was a false one. A clever man upon so delicate an errand has no use for a beard save to conceal his features. Come in here, Watson!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{seems quite}} convinced, doesn't he?" [...] Lessingham remarked, turning to Philippa. [...] "And as <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> {{a portion of}} the British Army, {{assisted}} by the local constabulary, is waiting for me outside, perhaps I had better humour him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘You immensely {{interest}} me,’ {{said the}} Prince; ‘the more so as <b>I</b> <b>gather</b> <b>that</b> here in Grünewald {{we are on}} the brink of revolution. Pray, since these have been your special studies, would you augur hopefully of such a movement?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A {{complete}} stranger!" [...] Wrayson answered. [...] "Her {{surprise at}} seeing me {{was at least}} equal to my own. <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> she had believed herself {{to be in the}} flat of Morris Barnes, which is the corresponding one above." ...|$|R
60|$|The Archduchess {{stared at}} me, and <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> {{she was not}} used to {{anything}} save implicit obedience from those to whom she made suggestions. She stared, and then she laughed softly. There was more than a spice of malice in her mirth.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{not going}} to prove much of a difficulty, {{particularly}} as it's one Mrs. Hunter has provided for. As it happens, Hall looked in on us last night, and <b>I</b> <b>gathered</b> <b>that</b> he hadn't a very high opinion of your cookery and catering." ...|$|R
