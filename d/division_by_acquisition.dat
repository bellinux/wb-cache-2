He revitalized Sony Music's publishing <b>division</b> <b>by</b> making such <b>acquisitions</b> as the Beatles catalogue and enabled Sony to become the first major music company to make available commercial digital downloads. Additionally, Mottola was the architect for some of Sony's biggest global brands such as Celine Dion and Mariah Carey.

Under Vuorilehto's management, Nokia was severely overhauled.

40|$|Submitted to 10 th IEEE Symposium on Computer Arithmetic. Integer {{division}} is considered {{within the context}} of the development of iHARP, an integrated circuit version of HARP, the HAtfield RISC Processor architecture. The paper demonstrates that execution times for <b>division</b> <b>by</b> small constants can be significantly reduced. Two cases are considered, <b>division</b> <b>by</b> powers of two and <b>division</b> <b>by</b> other small constants. In each case specialised instruction primitives are introduced to reduce the execution time. If an arithmetic shift right instruction is used to implement <b>division</b> <b>by</b> a power of two, an incorrect result is produced for negative dividends. The first iHARP primitive corrects the shift result and allows <b>division</b> <b>by</b> powers of two to be performed in a single machine cycle. The second iHARP primitive allows <b>division</b> <b>by</b> other small constants to be implemented efficiently as a finite series of multiplication steps. Execution time is reduced both by decreasing the number of operations involved and by exploiting the parallel nature of the iHARP architecture...|$|R
