5000|$|Chomsky has {{dismissed}} 9/11 conspiracy theories, {{stating that}} there is no credible evidence to support the claim that the United States government was responsible for <b>the</b> attacks. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> Bush <b>administration</b> would have had to be utterly insane to try anything like what is alleged, for their own narrow interests, and do not think that serious evidence has been provided to support claims about actions that would not only be outlandish, for their own interests, but that have no remote historical parallel.|$|R
5000|$|Vice President of Foreign Policy Studies at the Brookings Institution, Martin Indyk, said of {{the coming}} year that {{relations}} with Iran would be decisive, [...] "It's {{going to be very}} high on the agenda. Preventing Iran from getting nuclear weapons is a critical imperative for bolstering the nonproliferation regime." [...] Director of RAND International Security and Defense Policy Center, James Dobbins, said of implication for the Syrian civil war that: [...] "I don't think it's viable to stand aside if Syria gets worse and unless the Iranians are stupid enough to give us a better rationale for an unprovoked attack, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>administration</b> would do it." [...] Head of the Washington D.C.-based Inter-American Dialogue Michael Shifter said of Latin America's reaction to Obama: [...] "immigration issue was an area of disappointment and in general in Latin America there's been disappointment in Obama, which is why <b>I</b> <b>think</b> people would do well to have their expectations in check this time around." [...] "Progress relations with Latin America under Obama has been modest at best, but of course this was a choice. And some of the rhetoric from the Republicans, and from candidate Mitt Romney himself, was a lot more aggressive and made a lot of Latinos and Latin Americans very uneasy." [...] "In the relationship with Cuba, from Washington's point of view, there were steps that were taken in terms of making travel more flexible, lifting restrictions put into place under George W Bush, on remittances." [...] Latin America viewed these moves as [...] "nothing". [...] "It was seen as politically safe and that Obama hasn't been prepared to invest much political capital in the region." [...] "I don't think there is anything to suggest that things will be different this time around. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> only ray of hope for Latin Americans will be on immigration." ...|$|R

Unfortunately, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> script was funnier than the actual film came out to be, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> we were all on a {{different}} page. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> director wanted to make more of an action film or a heist film than he wanted to make a comedy, and Jim Kouf - he was also <b>the</b> writer - <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that he shied away from the comedy of it, which is unfortunate because if we had gone that way <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> film would have been more satisfying." ...|$|R

But, if there's just one thing where they're wrong, it's in the matter of <b>the</b> theatres. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> it would be much better for the Government not to attempt to cut down or regulate theatres in any way. The theatre is the people's recreation. It builds them up. It's all part of a great machine to win the war. I like to stand in the box office and see the money come in and feel that the theatre is doing its bit. But, mind you, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> President is doing fine. So, all I say is, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> theatres ought to be allowed to do fine, too." ...|$|R
