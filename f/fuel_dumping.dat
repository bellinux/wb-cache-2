50|$|<b>Fuel</b> <b>dumping</b> {{operations}} are coordinated with air traffic control, and precautions {{are taken to}} keep other aircraft clear of such areas. <b>Fuel</b> <b>dumping</b> is usually accomplished at a high enough altitude where the fuel will dissipate before reaching the ground. Fuel leaves the aircraft through a specific point on each wing, usually closer to the wingtips and further away from engines, and initially appears as more liquid than vapor.|$|E
5000|$|A [...] "dump-and-burn" [...] is a <b>fuel</b> <b>dumping</b> {{procedure}} where dumped fuel is intentionally ignited {{using the}} plane's afterburner. A spectacular flame combined with high speed {{makes this a}} popular display for airshows, or as a finale to fireworks. <b>Fuel</b> <b>dumping</b> is primarily used to reduce the mass of an aircraft to avoid a heavy / high speed landing; thus other than for safety or emergency reasons, the dump and burn procedure {{does not have a}} practical use.|$|E

50|$|A {{large scale}} <b>fuel</b> <b>dumping</b> {{occurred}} on September 11, 2001, when U.S. airspace was closed {{due to the}} September 11 attacks.

Many of these flights were fueled for travel well into the American interior; for those mid-flight aircraft unable to land due to excessive fuel weight, dumping was necessary.|$|E

50|$|The {{aircraft}} {{developed an}} oil leak shortly after {{taking off from}} Pago Pago harbor, and the crew {{decided to return to}} port. However, the S-42, fully loaded with fuel, was too heavy to land safely in the limited space of the harbor, so the crew elected to dump fuel before landing. While <b>fuel</b> <b>dumping</b> was in progress, there was a fire and explosion which destroyed the aircraft, killing all aboard. The exact cause of ignition for the fire could not be determined.|$|E
50|$|Thirteen {{minutes into}} the flight, at 16:43, 8900 m above the city of Cottbus, East Germany, the pilot {{reported}} problems with the elevator and the aircraft had left its designated route by some 10 degrees. The pilot requested a return to Schönefeld but didn't think that the situation was critical enough for an immediate landing at the nearest airport. At 16:51 the crew carried out a <b>fuel</b> <b>dumping</b> to decrease the landing weight. Meanwhile, the flight attendants reported smoke in the rear section of the cabin. When the pilot had Berlin-Schönefeld Airport already in sight and {{was just a few}} kilometers south of it, he issued a mayday at 16:59:25 indicating that he had problems controlling the plane's altitude. A few seconds later the tail section broke off the aircraft which then entered into an uncontrolled descent during which the front part of the plane also broke off before the various parts crashed into a wooded area near Königs Wusterhausen, East Germany.|$|E

50|$|Immediately, {{the crew}} {{noticed that the}} {{elevator}} control systems had failed — only the pitch trim remained operative — and that two engines were disabled. The reasons for this were unknown to the crew; they initially suspected that the aircraft could have been hit by something, possibly another aircraft. The pilots started an emergency descent to 13200 ft. The closest airport where the Il-62 might land was Gdańsk, but landing there was not possible because the crew could not dump enough fuel for the emergency landing attempt (the takeoff weight of the aircraft on that day was 167 tons, until 10:41 approximately 6 tons of fuel were consumed; the maximum landing weight of the Il-62M was 107 tons) so they turned their heading to Okęcie instead. Due to the damaged electrical system, the crew had problems with <b>fuel</b> <b>dumping</b> {{and they did not}} realize that the fire had spread to the cargo holds {{in the back of the}} aircraft (cargo holds 4 and 6), and in the final minutes probably spread into the passenger cabin.|$|E
50|$|The {{fuselage}} was an all-metal structure {{built in}} three main sections. These {{consisted of the}} nose section, which accommodated the crew; the section built integrally with the wing centre section; and the rear fuselage. The main structure was built out of the standard stringer and former skeleton design, to which stressed skin was riveted.The centre and rear sections were divided in the horizontal plane to {{within a couple of}} metres of the tail. The lower half of the fuselage contained the bomb cells, while the remainder and upper parts contained the bracing frames which supported and kept the bomb load secure.In {{the lower half of the}} fuselage the bomb bay stretched past the trailing edge wing roots to nearly a quarter of the way down the rear fuselage. Extra doors were added for torpedo operations against Naval targets. The extreme rear of the fuselage contained stowage space for anti-shipping weapons.In the upper fuselage, directly above the forward bomb cells in the centre section, just aft of the cockpit, the 242 gallon fuel tank was located. Attached to this was a fuel jettisoning pipe which was fitted to the roof of the fuselage and ran along it to the tail of the aircraft. It declined and exited the fuselage behind the tail wheel to allow <b>fuel</b> <b>dumping</b> in an emergency.Above the two rear bomb cells in the centre section, a dinghy stowage place was created. To protect its very vulnerable structure against enemy fire, it was placed in a heavily armoured case. Either side of the dinghy, aft of the 242 imp gal fuel tank, and directly above the rear bomb bay, were the oxygen bottles.|$|E
50|$|The crew {{tried to}} land at Okęcie from the south (due to strong wind) and turned the {{aircraft}} 180 degrees to runway 33 but a rapidly spreading in-flight fire, which spread to {{the exterior of the}} aircraft (which was trailing a huge flame and dense black smoke), caused a total failure of surviving flight controls, including the pitch trim. The landing gear also was not functioning. The emergency <b>fuel</b> <b>dumping</b> pumps were also malfunctioning; sometimes they stopped functioning at all, only to resume dumping fuel minutes later. At the moment of the crash, approximately 32 tons of fuel were still in the tanks. A very straight turn to the left was started at 11.09 at 4900 ft with an airspeed of 480 km/h. At the moment the aircraft passed the village of Józefosław, approximately 10 km from the airport, several burnt-out elements of its fuselage fell out, starting local fires on the ground. Supposedly, at this moment the fire destroyed the pitch trim controls. When the aircraft passed the town of Piaseczno, it went into sinusoid-shaped flight for the final seconds and nose-dived with a slight 11 degrees left bank and 12 degree pitch downwards, crashing into the ground at 475 km/h and exploding into pieces in the forest 5700 m from the Warsaw airport runway. (As the nose dive started very shortly before the crash, one hypothesis states that in the final moments, fire from the cargo hold spread into the rear part of passenger cabin, causing mass panic; the passengers moved towards the nose of the aircraft, away from the fire, destabilizing the aircraft and causing the dive. Another is that rapidly spreading fire deformed the fuselage in its rear, which — combined with strong forces acting on the empennage - altered the aircraft's angle of attack and contributed to the rapid dive.) The wreckage was scattered over a rectangular area, approximately 370 by 50 m.|$|E
