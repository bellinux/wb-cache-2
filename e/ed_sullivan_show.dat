5|$|Early in his career, Jim Henson's {{work was}} aimed at mature audiences. His {{television}} program Sam and Friends was designed for young adults. During this period, his characters often appeared on late-night, comedy television programs The Jimmy Dean Show and The <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> <b>Show.</b> Throughout the 1960s, Jim Henson used his puppets for profane, irreverent comedy. These early Henson creations made references to substance abuse and sexual intercourse; The A.V. Club said Henson was probably influenced {{by the work of}} Ralph Bakshi, who was also active during the 1960s.|$|E

5|$|The Land of Gorch was a {{recurring}} skit {{that appeared in}} season one of the American comedy television program Saturday Night Live, featuring Jim Henson's Muppets. Prior to his work for children on Sesame Street, Henson had created puppetry work, including his show Sam and Friends, for adult audiences. His characters appeared regularly on the late-night comedy television programs, and The <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> <b>Show.</b> After Sesame Street, Henson feared he would become typecast into working on children's television series. His talent agent Bernie Brillstein, who represented Gilda Radner, Dan Aykroyd, and John Belushi, helped him transition to Saturday Night Live.|$|E
5|$|The team {{designed}} venues {{that represented}} {{parts of the}} Beatles' history {{in order to create}} an atmosphere of authenticity. For example, the set of The <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> <b>Show</b> was recreated from photographs and videos, including a rare color photograph in Apple's collection that showed the yellow tint used to enhance the video as shown on black-and-white television sets. The Cavern Club, Shea Stadium, Budokan, Abbey Road Studios and the rooftop of the Apple Corps Headquarters also appear as venues in the game. Fashions of the 1960s were researched to properly apply them to the various virtual crowds at these locations.|$|E

5|$|Aspinall's job as {{personal}} assistant consisted of driving to concerts and meetings, but mostly meant just being there whenever someone needed something.

Before the cover of Sgt. Pepper's could be completed by Peter Blake, Aspinall was sent out to find photographs of all of the people that were to be shown on the front cover. Aspinall suggested the idea of Sergeant Pepper being the compere, who would introduce the group, and the reprise of the title song {{near the end of the}} album.|$|E
5|$|Reckless {{was kept}} by Pedersen's {{family for a}} brief time before moving to a more {{permanent}} home with the 5th Marines, 1st Marine Division at Camp Pendleton. A second article about Reckless appeared in The Saturday Evening Post on October 22, 1955. These two articles and the book Reckless: Pride of the Marines (1955) were written by the commander of the 2nd Battalion, Lieutenant Colonel Andrew Geer, who kept notes about Reckless during the war. She made several public appearances, including Art Linkletter's show House Party, but had to cancel an appearance on The <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> <b>Show</b> due to the typhoon. Ed Sullivan had wanted her to appear on his November 7 show and was willing to pay the costs to get her there right after the scheduled, and delayed, November 5 arrival. Reckless never did appear on Sullivan's show.|$|E
5|$|Because the Supremes {{were popular}} with white {{audience}}s {{as well as}} with black ones, Gordy had the group cater to its middle American audience with performances at renowned supper clubs such as the Copacabana in New York. Broadway and pop standards were incorporated into their repertoire alongside their own hit songs. As a result, the Supremes {{became one of the first}} black musical acts to achieve complete and sustained crossover success. Black rock and roll musicians of the 1950s had seen many of their original hit tunes covered by white musicians, with these covers usually achieving more fame and sales success than the originals. The Supremes' success, however, counteracted this trend. Featuring three group members who were marketed for their individual personalities (a move unprecedented at the time) and Diana Ross's pop-friendly voice, the Supremes broke down racial barriers with rock and roll songs underpinned by R stylings. The group became extremely popular both domestically and abroad, becoming one of the first black musical acts to appear regularly on television programs such as Hullabaloo, The Hollywood Palace, The Della Reese Show, and, most notably, The <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> <b>Show,</b> on which they made 17 appearances. The Supremes' cross-cultural success effectively paved the way for the mainstream success of contemporaneous label mates such as the Temptations, the Four Tops and the Jackson 5.|$|E
50|$|Included {{are more}} than 10,000 live {{performances}} by virtually every popular entertainer of the post-war era. Best known are appearances by Elvis Presley and the Beatles that {{have become part of}} television and cultural history. Three <b>Sullivan</b> <b>shows</b> from the 1950s featured Presley. On the final one, he was only shown from the waist up because CBS censors viewed his pelvic gyrations as sexually suggestive. The American television debut of the Beatles on 9 February 1964 attracted 73 million viewers. The Beatles also appeared the following two weeks and did a fourth <b>Sullivan</b> <b>show</b> on 12 September 1965.|$|R

5|$|Two {{days after}} the {{television}} appearance, on 11 February 1964, the Beatles' first U.S. concert took place, at Washington Coliseum, a sports arena in Washington, D.C. The concert was attended by eight thousand fans. The Beatles performed on a central stage in the arena, with the audience on all sides, and there were regular pauses to enable the band to turn their equipment around and perform facing in another direction. The concert generated intense excitement. The following day, the Beatles performed a second concert, in Carnegie Hall, New York, which was attended by two thousand fans. The concert was again well received. Following the Carnegie Hall concert, the Beatles flew to Miami Beach and on Sunday 16 February 1964 made their second television appearance on The <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> <b>Show,</b> which this time was broadcast live from the Napoleon Ballroom of the Deauville Hotel in Miami Beach. As it had done on 9 February, the television broadcast attracted around 70million viewers. On 22 February 1964, the Beatles returned to the UK. Arriving at Heathrow airport at 7 am, they were met by an estimated ten thousand fans.|$|E
5|$|While coach McGuire and Rosenbluth {{boarded a}} plane to New York to appear on The <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> <b>Show,</b> {{the rest of the}} Tar Heels {{returned}} to North Carolina two days later when they landed at Raleigh–Durham International Airport (RDU). The North Carolina squad was greeted by over 10,000 fans. Some players were carried by members of the crowd from the airport ramp to the terminal. The airport manager believed the crowd gathered to meet the Tar Heels was the biggest in RDU's history. The crowd was so big that it prevented Chancellor Robert House from giving a planned speech for the team. The large crowd at the airport was credited to the airing of both the national semifinal and National Championship game on television around North Carolina. The 1957 North Carolina team were awarded watches for their victory in the national championship. In the 1990s, the team was given rings to commemorate their win in the national championship game after then North Carolina coach Dean Smith insisted upon giving the team rings. Coach McGuire was given a brand new Carolina blue and white Cadillac by the university, as well as being signed to a new fiveyear contract that gave him $11,500 per year.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} years of television, both CBS and NBC {{networks}} had their own symphony orchestras. NBC's was conducted by Arturo Toscanini and CBS's by Alfredo Antonini. The <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> <b>Show</b> was basically a musical variety show, and thus members of the CBS orchestra were folded into the <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> <b>Show</b> Orchestra, conducted by Ray Bloch. During the early days of television, the demands on studio musicians were many-tiered. They needed to be proficient in all genres of music, from classical, to jazz and to rock and roll. The <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> <b>Show</b> would regularly feature singers from the Metropolitan Opera and the staff orchestra would accompany divas such as Eileen Farrell, Maria Callas or Joan Sutherland. The musicians needed to be prepared to switch gears for Ella Fitzgerald, Diahann Carroll or Sammy Davis, Jr. and then onto The Jackson Five, Stevie Wonder or Tom Jones or Itzhak Perlman. They also needed to perform with some of the greatest dancers and ballerinas of the time, from Gregory Hines, Juliet Prowse or Margo Fonteyn to the Peter Genarro dancers. Few musicians are capable of crossing over from one genre to another. However, each member of the <b>Ed</b> <b>Sullivan</b> <b>Show</b> Orchestra was a specialist and more than capable of covering the complete spectrum of music.|$|E
