5000|$|The stylized fact of firm size {{has been}} found in the {{industrial}} economic literature. Small firms grow relatively fast since they have to achieve a minimum <b>efficient</b> <b>size</b> (Audretsch et al., 2004). Similarly, Yasuda (2005) finds a negative effect of firm size on firm growth in the case of Japanese manufacturing firms. Other studies which incorporated different countries and industries also indicate a negative effect of size on firm growth (Almus & Nerlinger, 2000; Bottazzi & Secchi, 2003; Calvo, 2006; Dunne & Hughes, 1994; Goddard, Wilson & Blandon, 2002; McPherson, 1996). Furthermore, researchers who studied firm growth in different size groups suggest that Gibrat’s law of size independence only holds for firms above a certain size threshold, for instance a relatively large size with over 400 employees (Bigsten & Gebreeyesus, 2007). Therefore, we can conclude that there exists a negative relationship between firm size and growth especially for firms with less than 400 employees.|$|E
50|$|In {{the long}} run, due to {{desire to keep}} costs low, it was {{advantageous}} for firms to merge and reduce their transportation costs thus producing and transporting from one location rather than various sites of different companies as in the past. Low transport costs, coupled with economies of scale also increased firm size by two- to fourfold {{during the second half}} of the nineteenth century. In addition, technological changes prior to the merger movement within companies increased the <b>efficient</b> <b>size</b> of plants with capital intensive assembly lines allowing for economies of scale. Thus improved technology and transportation were forerunners to the Great Merger Movement. In part due to competitors as mentioned above, and in part due to the government, however, many of these initially successful mergers were eventually dismantled. The U.S. government passed the Sherman Act in 1890, setting rules against price fixing and monopolies. Starting in the 1890s with such cases as Addyston Pipe and Steel Company v. United States, the courts attacked large companies for strategizing with others or within their own companies to maximize profits. Price fixing with competitors created a greater incentive for companies to unite and merge under one name so that they were not competitors anymore and technically not price fixing.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the absence}} of {{barriers}} to entry and collusion in a market, {{the existence of a}} monopoly, and therefore monopoly profit, cannot persist in the long run. (Note that a barrier can be caused by increasing returns to scale—a bigger firm can produce more cheaply. If the most <b>efficient</b> <b>size</b> firm serves the whole market, we have a [...] "natural monopoly," [...] and no other firms will [...] "rush" [...] to enter.) Normally, when economic profit exists within an industry, economic agents rush to form new firms in the industry in an effort to obtain at least a portion of the existing economic profit. [...] As new firms enter the industry, they increase the supply of the product available in the Market, and these new firms are forced to charge a lower price to entice consumers to buy the additional supply these new firms are supplying (they compete for customers). Since consumers will flock toward the lowest price (in search of a bargain), older firms within the industry actually face losing their existing customers to the new firms entering the industry, and are therefore forced to lower their prices to match the lower prices set by the new firms. New firms will continue to enter the industry until the price of the product is lowered {{to the point that it}} is the same as the average economic cost of producing the product, and all of the economic profit disappears. When this happens, economic agents outside of the industry find no advantage to entering the industry, supply of the product stops increasing, and the price charged for the product stabilizes. Essentially, a competitive situation always leads to an equilibrium solution".|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop {{a model for}} local {{authority}} size {{that is based on}} the approach towards local government reform that was used by the UK governments in the 1970 s and the 1990 s. To do so, we examine the different aspects of costs for local services, the minimum cost size facility used to provide local services, and the minimum <b>efficient</b> <b>size</b> for a local authority. We then argue that, for a given level of service, the belief that a tendency for local authorities to become enablers rather than producers would reduce the minimum <b>efficient</b> <b>size</b> of authority may not be correct. Finally, the model is developed to determine simultaneously the optimum quantity of local services and the minimum <b>efficient</b> <b>size.</b> It shows that the solution depends on how preferences vary among different citizens, and argues that governments paid too little heed to these variations. Thus we conclude that it is very doubtful whether either the 1970 s or the 1990 s reforms produced the structure of local government that would have emerged if the approach adopted by the governments concerned had been used with more care. ...|$|E

40|$|In {{remote sensing}} image-blurring is induced by many {{sources such as}} {{atmospheric}} scatter, optical aberration, spatial and temporal sensor integration. The natural blurring can be exploited to speed up target search by fast template matching. In this paper, we synthetically induce additional non-uniform blurring to further increase {{the speed of the}} matching process. To avoid loss of accuracy, the amount of synthetic blurring is varied spatially over the image according to the underlying content. We extend transitive algorithm for fast template matching by incorporating controlled image blur. To this end we propose an <b>Efficient</b> Group <b>Size</b> (EGS) algorithm which minimizes the number of similarity computations for a particular search image. A larger <b>efficient</b> group <b>size</b> guarantees less computations and more speedup. EGS algorithm is used as a component in our proposed Optimizing auto-correlation (OptA) algorithm.
