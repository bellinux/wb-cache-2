Mae, {{with whom he}} had one son and two daughters: Clark Shaughnessy, Jr.; Janice Shaughnessy (mother of Grateful Dead drummer Bill Kreutzmann); and Marcia Wilson. He met his wife in New Orleans while {{coaching}} at Tulane. A teetotaler, Shaughnessy held a negative opinion of both drinkers and smokers. Marchmont Schwartz noted, [...] "When he said, 'Let's <b>go</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> drink,' he meant, 'Let's go drink a milk shake...He disappointed a lot of newspapermen that way." [...] Aside from his declared hobby as a football coach and experimenter, he enjoyed long-distance driving. Shaughnessy preferred to devise plays late at night, between midnight and dawn, while his household slept.

500|$|After {{surviving}} a thunderstorm, {{the flying}} house lands on a tepui opposite Paradise Falls. Carl and Russell harness {{themselves to the}} still-buoyant house and begin to walk it across the mesa, hoping to reach the falls before the balloons deflate. Russell encounters a tall, colorful flightless bird, known as the mythical [...] "Snipe", whom he names [...] "Kevin". They then meet a Golden Retriever named Dug, who wears a special collar {{that allows him to}} speak and who vows to take the bird to his master. The next day, they encounter a pack of aggressive dogs led by Alpha, a Doberman Pinscher, and are taken to their master, who turns out to be Charles Muntz. Muntz invites Carl and Russell aboard his dirigible, where he explains to them that he is searching for a giant bird. When Russell notes the bird's similarity to Kevin, Muntz becomes hostile, believing they are attempting to capture the bird themselves. Carl flees with Kevin and Dug, but Muntz captures Kevin and starts a fire beneath Carl's house, forcing him to choose between saving it or Kevin. After Carl saves the house, he and Russell eventually reach the falls, though Russell is upset at Carl for abandoning Kevin. Carl looks through Ellie's childhood scrapbook and is surprised to find that she has filled in the blank pages with photos of their marriage, along with a note thanking him for the [...] "adventure" [...] and encouraging him to <b>go</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> new one.|$|E

St. Barbanas Church, in which it was held, was filled to its capacity, and many people had to stand outside. He was interred at the Hillside Cemetery in Medicine Hat. His wife, Jean, was buried beside him upon her death on September 6, 1944.|$|E

In her closing sonnet, “The Distance,” Wiese declares her “conviction that poetry / was the highest object of humanity.” There’s something to that, and enough in Floating City to suggest that Wiese will be serving that object for some time to come.

Walking together, the three saw Morco and Sterling walking toward them, at which Ben Thompson fired a rifle shot in their direction. Morco and Sterling continued to advance, when suddenly Billy Thompson's shotgun discharged, accidentally shooting Sheriff Whitney. By all accounts, including that of Sheriff Whitney before his death on August 18, the shooting was an accident. Billy Thompson was forced by his brother to flee to avoid being lynched, probably a good decision at the time. He was later arrested and returned for trial, and acquitted.|$|E

The pair stood at the bar talking with bartender John Laker when Cherries Dunn suddenly barged in. Dunn told Laker to set the house up with drinks...except for Rohan. Skippy growled, [...] "What's the matter with me?" [...] To which Dunn sneered, [...] "Go on, you snitch!". Rohan stepped away from the bar, but before he could speak Dunn shot him squarely on the nose. Another bullet struck Rohan in the heart before he collapsed to the floor.|$|E

5000|$|During {{a week of}} {{stunting}} in September 1989, {{including an}} hour of an urban contemporary micro-format, Z93 DJs demanded that WRBQ-FM (known as [...] "Q105") pay them up to $4 million {{if they wanted to}} remain the only Top 40 station in Tampa Bay market. Q105 didn’t budge, ignoring the demands and now parodies of the Q jocks airing on Z93. They also had to ignore the daily newspaper and TV news coverage the ransom request was receiving. Not one to be ignored, station manager Randy Michaels gave the go ahead for the change. Before the flip officially occurred, at 8:15 AM on the 25th, Z93 DJs Jack Harris & Dr. Don Carpenter called Q105’s owner, Gary Edens, at a private hotel room on the other coast (5:15am Gary’s time) waking him up to offer him one last chance to pay the now $4 million ransom to keep Z93 from switching to Top 40.
