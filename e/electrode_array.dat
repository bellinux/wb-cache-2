25|$|A highly publicised {{extension}} to the experiment, {{in which a}} simpler array was implanted into the arm of Warwick's wife—with the ultimate aim of one day creating a form of telepathy or empathy using the Internet to communicate the signal from afar—was also successful in-so-far as it resulted in the first direct and purely electronic communication between the nervous systems of two humans. Finally, {{the effect of the}} implant on Warwick's hand function was measured using the University of Southampton Hand Assessment Procedure (SHAP). It was feared that directly interfacing with the nervous system might cause some form of damage or interference, but no measurable effect nor rejection was found. Indeed, nerve tissue grew around the <b>electrode</b> <b>array,</b> enclosing the sensor.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1990s Babak Taheri, at University of California, Davis {{demonstrated}} {{the first single}} and also multichannel dry active electrode arrays using micro-machining. The single channel dry EEG electrode construction and results were published in 1994. The arrayed electrode was also demonstrated to perform well compared to silver/silver chloride electrodes. The device consisted of four sites of sensors with integrated electronics to reduce noise by impedance matching. The advantages of such electrodes are: (1) no electrolyte used, (2) no skin preparation, (3) significantly reduced sensor size, and (4) compatibility with EEG monitoring systems. The active <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> is an integrated system made of an array of capacitive sensors with local integrated circuitry housed in a package with batteries to power the circuitry. This level of integration was required to achieve the functional performance obtained by the electrode.|$|E

2500|$|The {{second stage}} {{involved}} {{a more complex}} neural interface which was designed and built especially for the experiment by Dr. Mark Gasson and his team at the University of Reading. This device consisted of a BrainGate <b>electrode</b> <b>array,</b> connected to an external [...] "gauntlet" [...] that housed supporting electronics. It was implanted on 14 March 2002, in the Radcliffe Infirmary and was interfaced directly into Warwick's nervous system. The <b>electrode</b> <b>array</b> inserted contained 100 electrodes, of which 25 could be accessed at any one time, whereas the median nerve which it monitored carries many times that number of signals. The experiment proved successful, and the signal produced was detailed enough that a robot arm developed by Warwick's colleague, Dr Peter Kyberd, was able to mimic the actions of Warwick's own arm.|$|E
2500|$|Direct {{cortical}} {{electrical stimulation}} (DCES), {{also known as}} cortical stimulation mapping, is frequently performed in concurrence with ECoG recording for functional mapping of the cortex and identification of critical cortical structures. When using a crown configuration, a handheld wand bipolar stimulator may be used at any location along the <b>electrode</b> <b>array.</b> [...] However, when using a subdural strip, stimulation must be applied between pairs of adjacent electrodes due to the nonconductive material connecting the electrodes on the grid. [...] Electrical stimulating currents applied to the cortex are relatively low, between 2 and 4 mA for somatosensory stimulation, and near 15 mA for cognitive stimulation.|$|E

40|$|Practical phantoms are {{essential}} to assess the electrical impedance tomography (EIT) systems for their validation, calibration and comparison purposes. Metal surface electrodes are generally used in practical phantoms which reduce the SNR of the boundary data due to their design and development errors. Novel flexible and biocompatible gold <b>electrode</b> <b>arrays</b> of high geometric precision are proposed to improve the boundary data quality in EIT. The flexible gold <b>electrode</b> <b>arrays</b> are developed on flexible FR 4 sheets using thin film technology and practical gold electrode phantoms are developed with different configurations.

Boundary data profile and the resistivity images obtained from the gold electrode phantoms are compared with identical phantoms developed with stainless steel electrodes. Surface profilometry, microscopy and the impedance spectroscopy show that the gold <b>electrode</b> <b>arrays</b> are smooth, geometrically precised and less resistive. Results show that the boundary data accuracy and image quality are improved with gold <b>electrode</b> <b>arrays.</b> Results show that the diametric resistivity plot (DRP), contrast to noise ratio (CNR), percentage of contrast recovery (PCR) and coefficient of contrast (COC) of reconstructed images are improved in gold electrode phantoms.
