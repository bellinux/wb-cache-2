5|$|Nobody {{has ever}} cut {{anything}} from Andrei Rublev. Nobody except me. I made some cuts myself. In {{the first version}} the film was 3 hours 20 minutes long. In the second — 3 hours 15 minutes. I shortened the final version to 3 hours 6 minutes. I am convinced the latest version is the best, the most successful. And I only cut certain overly long scenes. The viewer doesn't even notice their absence. The cuts have in no way changed neither the subject matter nor what was for us important in the film. In other words, we removed overly long scenes which had no significance. We shortened certain scenes of brutality in order to induce psychological shock in viewers, {{as opposed to a}} mere unpleasant impression which would only destroy our intent. All my friends and colleagues who during long discussions were advising me to make those cuts turned out right in the end. It took me some time to understand it.

Later I understood that this final version of the film more than fulfils my requirements for it. And I do not regret at all that the film has been shortened to its present length.|$|E

Well, that's how I remember it, anyway." [...] He also said Rundgren directed the band from the control room with engineer Jack Douglas and hardly spoke to them while they recorded the album.

During his training flights, he stalled and crashed a Spitfire. Johnson had his harness straps on too loose, and wrenched his shoulders – revealing that his earlier rugby injury had not healed properly. The Spitfire did a ground loop, ripping {{off one of the}} undercarriage legs and forcing the other up through the port main plane. The commanding officer (CO) excused Johnson, for the [...] "short airfield" [...] was difficult to land on for an inexperienced pilot. Johnson <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression,</b> however, that he would be watched closely, and felt that if he made another mistake, he would be [...] "certainly washed out". Johnson tried to pack the injured shoulder with wool, held in place by adhesive tape. He also tightened the straps to reduce vibrations. Johnson found he had lost his [...] "feel" [...] in his right hand, and it became numb. When he practised dives, the pressure also aggravated his shoulder. He often tried to fly using his left hand only, but the Spitfire would have to be handled with both hands during anything other than simple manoeuvres. Despite the difficulties with his injuries, on 28 August 1940, the course was complete. Johnson had 205.25 hours on operational types including 23.50 on the Spitfire.|$|E

His designed featured a joystick for each player, which was encased in a pink dome that the player would rest their hands on to control the joysticks, meant to resemble breasts. Faraco later acknowledged that [...] "they didn't have bumps on them or anything, but {{the way they were}} the size of grapefruits next to each other, you <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> of what they were supposed to be." [...] Atari's second engineer, Don Lange, who assisted with the game, has also stated that the design was intentional on the part of Faraco, who fellow Atari designer Regan Chang has claimed [...] "had some really far out ideas". According to rumor, Faraco got the idea from a joke that joysticks resembled phalluses, and that Atari should make a game with female controls. Like Faraco's initial design for Space Race, which was changed due to its expense after a few dozen units, the joysticks for Gotcha were changed to standard ones shortly into the production run prior to the October 1973 release. The design did inspire the advertising flyer {{for the game}}, however, which features a man chasing a woman in a nightdress with the initial design of the cabinet behind them. The final cabinet stands over 5 feet tall and weighs nearly 200 pounds. The breast-like controllers reappeared in yellow in prototype versions of the 1974 Touch Me arcade game, but were not used in production.|$|E

2500|$|Dorothy Fields had {{the idea}} for a musical about Annie Oakley, to star her friend, Ethel Merman. Producer Mike Todd turned the project down, so Fields {{approached}} a new producing team, Richard Rodgers and Oscar Hammerstein II. After the success of their first musical collaboration, Oklahoma!, Rodgers and Hammerstein had decided to become producers of both their own theatrical ventures and those by other authors. They agreed to produce the musical and asked Jerome Kern to compose the music; Fields would write the lyrics, and she and her brother Herbert would write the book. Kern, who had been composing for movie musicals in Hollywood, returned to New York on November 2, 1945 to begin work on the score to Annie Get Your Gun, but three days later, he collapsed on the street due to a cerebral hemorrhage. Kern was hospitalized, and he died on November 11, 1945. The producers and Fields then asked Irving Berlin to write the musical's score; Fields agreed to step down as lyricist, knowing that Berlin preferred to write both music and lyrics to his songs. Berlin initially declined to write the score, worrying that he would be unable to write songs to fit specific scenes in [...] "a situation show." [...] Hammerstein persuaded him to study the script and try writing some songs based on it, and within days, Berlin returned with the songs [...] "Doin' What Comes Naturally", [...] "You Can't Get a Man With a Gun", and [...] "There's No Business Like Show Business". Berlin's songs suited the story and Ethel Merman's abilities, and he readily composed the rest of the score to Annie Get Your Gun. The show's eventual hit song, [...] "There's No Business Like Show Business," [...] was almost left out of the show because Berlin mistakenly <b>got</b> <b>the</b> <b>impression</b> that Richard Rodgers did not like it.

In an attempt to evaluate changes in the undergraduate curriculum over the past 10 years, our initial 1993 survey of industrial employers was repeated in 2004 (3). We estimate that 26 % of recent B. S. graduates go directly into chemistry-related employment in manufacturing and service industries; a significant fraction of those take analytical chemistry jobs.
