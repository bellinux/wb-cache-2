40|$|Interactions {{by mutual}} {{excitation}} in neural populations in {{human and animal}} brains cre- ate a mesoscopic order parameter that is recorded in brain waves (electroencephalogram, EEG). Spatially and spectrally distributed oscillations are imposed on the background activity by inhibitory feedback in the gamma range (30 – 80 Hz). Beats recur at theta rates (3 – 7 Hz), at which the order parameter transiently approaches zero and micro- scopic activity becomes disordered. After these null spikes, the order parameter resurges and initiates a <b>frame</b> <b>bearing</b> a mesoscopic spatial pattern of gamma amplitude modu- lation that governs the microscopic activity, and that is correlated with behavior. The brain waves also reveal a spatial pattern of phase modulation {{in the form of}} a cone. Using the formalism of the dissipative many-body model of brain, we describe the null spike as a singularity, the following amplitude pattern as a ground state, and the phase cone as the manifestation of a stabilizing vortex. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{primary school}} in Rotonda was {{monitored}} during an on-going seismic sequence in the Pollino area, Southern Italy. The Reinforced Concrete (RC) {{building is a}} typical three story building with a concrete <b>frame,</b> <b>bearing</b> pre-cast slab flooring, concrete block internal walls and pre-cast external infill slabs. The monitoring began in September 2011 with a single station {{on top of the}} building, and after the ML= 5 mainshock occurred in October 2012 a network was completed with accelerometers on each floor and real-time streaming data was transmitted to the Istituto Nazionale di Oceanografia e Geofisica Sperimentale (Udine-Northern Italy). The school suffered no visible damage during the sequence. The real-time monitoring of the Rotonda school proved to be important for two reasons: (1) the large range of magnitudes and recorded peak accelerations allowed the study of the non-stationary frequency response; (2) the results also show how a simple, real-time monitoring system using cost-effective accelerometers {{could be used as a}} tool to provide information on the damage state and usability of the school...|$|E
