40|$|Abstract. This {{study focused}} on the {{properties}} of the cement asphalt emulsion (CA) mortar. The mixtures of the samples were fabricated and allowed them seven, fourteen and twenty eight days for curing before tested by compressive strength, three points flexural test, and indirect tensile strength to probe into their engineering properties. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> mortar samples used as control are analyzed for comparison. The test results show that the compressive strength is <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> mortar greater than CA mortar; the flexural strength at curing of 28 days is CA mortar greater than <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> mortar, however, at curing of 7 and 14 days is <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> mortar greater than CA mortar; and the indirect tensile strength is <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> mortar greater than CA mortar. The Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis results show that the Ca(OH 2) increased with increases curing time. The CA mortar samples fabricated needs appropriate water for lubrication. Thus, the water absorption of fine aggregate must be concerned. The emulsion asphalt added too much may reduce the strength. In field test, the CA mortar performs very well, especially in workability...|$|R

40|$|Currently, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> grouts are {{approved}} for Iowa Department of Transportation projects {{on the basis}} of a pullout test. However, other properties of the grouts should be evaluated. Therefore, this research was initiated to develop criteria to better evaluate <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> grouts. Fourteen grouts were tested for compressive strength, time of set, durability, consistency and shrinkage. Tested grouts all yielded compressive strengths higher than 3000 psi at 7 days and durability factors were well above 70. Time of set and consistency was adequate. The testing showed most grouts tested shrank, even though tested grouts were labeled non-shrink grouts. For many applications of grouts such as setting in anchor bolts and as a filler, minor shrinkage is not a problem. However, for some critical applications, shrinkage cannot be tolerated. The proposed Instructional Memorandum will identify those grouts which do not excessively shrink or expand in the tests used. Based on test results, criteria for evaluation of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> grouts have been recommended.

50|$|Rosendale cement {{generally}} {{refers to}} a type of natural cement that was produced in and around Rosendale, New York, from argillaceous limestone, but is a term that has had different definitions at different times.

Because of its reputation, Rosendale cement has also been used as both a trade name and as a generic term referring to natural <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements</b> produced elsewhere.

5000|$|Early <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cements,</b> such {{as those}} of James Parker, James Frost and Joseph Aspdin were {{relatively}} soft and readily ground by the primitive technology of the day, using flat millstones. The emergence of Portland cement in the 1840s made grinding considerably more difficult, because the clinker produced by the kiln is often as hard as the millstone material. Because of this, cement continued to be ground very coarsely (typically 20% over 100 μm particle diameter) until better grinding technology became available. Besides producing un-reactive cement with slow strength growth, this exacerbated the problem of unsoundness. This late, disruptive expansion is caused by hydration of large particles of calcium oxide. Fine grinding lessens this effect, and early cements had to be stored for several months to give the calcium oxide time to hydrate before it was fit for sale. From 1885 onward, the development of specialized steel {{led to the development of}} new forms of grinding equipment, and from this point onward, the typical fineness of cement began a steady rise. The progressive reduction in the proportion of larger, un-reactive cement particles has been partially responsible for the fourfold increase in the strength of Portland cement during the twentieth century. [...] The recent history of the technology has been mainly concerned with reducing the energy consumption of the grinding process.|$|E

40|$|Portland cement {{is a fine}} powder, gray {{or white}} in color, that {{consists}} of a mixture of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>cement</b> materials comprising primarily calcium silicates, aluminates and aluminoferrites. More than 30 raw materials {{are known to be}} used in the manufacture of portland cement, and these materials can be divided into four distinct categories: calcareous, siliceous, argillaceous, and ferrifrous. These materials are chemically combined through pyroprocessing and subjected to subsequent mechanical processing operations to form gray and white portland cement. Gray portland cement is used for structural applications and is the more common type of cement produced. White portland cement has lower iron and manganese contents than gray portland cement and is used primarily for decorative purposes.
