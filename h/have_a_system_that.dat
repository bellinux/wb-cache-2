2500|$|The site {{does not}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> filters the correct answers from the {{incorrect}} answers. At one time, the community could {{vote for the}} best answer among the posted answers; but that option was disabled in March 2014. For most {{of the life of}} Yahoo! Answers, once the [...] "best answer" [...] was chosen, {{there was no way to}} add more answers nor to improve or challenge the best answer chosen by the question asker; there is a display of thumbs down or thumbs up for each answer, but viewers cannot vote. In April 2014, this was changed to allow for additional answers after a best answer is chosen, but the best answer can never be changed. Also, while [...] "best answers" [...] can be briefly commented upon, the comment is not visible by default and is hence hardly read. (Even the user who posts the question isn't notified, before or after the best answer is picked, about a comment on the question or on the best answer.) If the best answer chosen is wrong or contains problematic information, the only chance to give a better (or correct) answer will be the next time the same question is asked. The older answer will likely get higher priority in search engines. Any new answer will most probably not be seen by any original questioner.|$|E

50|$|WRNY was {{the second}} to {{broadcast}} television pictures to the general public, after W3XK in Washington, D.C., and was preceded by several attempts to broadcast television pictures. In 1927 AT&T <b>had</b> demonstrated <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> sent television images and sound over telephone lines. The General Electric Research Laboratory in Schenectady NY was sending experimental television over their shortwave radio station in early 1928. Westinghouse <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> would broadcast motion pictures. Several other laboratories were also conducting experiments and demonstrations.|$|R

60|$|Before, however, any {{sufficiently}} {{great and}} capable body of {{men can be}} found to abolish these shams, these shams that must necessarily hamper and limit the development of our children, {{it is necessary that}} they should have some clear idea of the thing that is to follow, and the real security of these obsolete institutions lies very largely in the fact that at present the thing that is to follow does not define itself. It is too commonly assumed that the alternative to a more or less hereditary government is democratic republicanism of the American type, and the defence of the former consists usually in an indictment of the latter, complicated in very illogical cases by the assertion (drawn from the French instance) that Republics are unstable. But it does not follow that because one condemns the obvious shams of the British system that one must accept the shams of the United States. While in Great Britain we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> masks and hampers the best of our race under a series of artificial inequalities, the United States theory of the essential equality of all men is equally not in accordance with the reality of life. In America, just as in England, the intelligent child grows up to discover that the pretensions of public life are not justified, and quite equally to be flawed in thought and action by that discovery.|$|E

50|$|In 2001, IRD {{publicly}} {{raised the}} possibility of <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> allowed provisional taxpayers to pool their payments through a commercial intermediary so the interest charged on underpayments and paid on overpayments would be closer to normal commercial interest rates, avoiding the current wide differential.|$|R

50|$|In the United States and Canada, many {{engines in}} 1973 and newer {{vehicles}} (1972 and newer in California) <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> routes a metered amount of exhaust into the intake tract under particular operating conditions. Exhaust neither burns nor supports combustion, so it dilutes the air/fuel charge to reduce peak combustion chamber temperatures. This, in turn, reduces {{the formation of}} NOx.|$|E

50|$|The first radio {{navigation}} system to be operated by Bomber Command was Gee. This operated by sending out two pulses of known timing from ground stations which were {{picked up by the}} aircraft and read on an oscilloscope. The timing between transmissions was not fixed and varied from station to station, so the equipment in the bomber <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> allowed it to adjust for this.|$|R

50|$|When the Moderate Party under General Ramón María Narváez {{first took}} power in May 1844, they {{inherited}} the progressive Spanish Constitution of 1837, and promptly set about revising {{it to be}} {{more in line with}} their principals.

50|$|The Caterpillar 740 Ejector Articulated Truck is Caterpillar's second {{generation}} of articulated haulers (dump truck) to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> pushes material {{out the back of}} the body. It is the largest articulated haul truck offered by Caterpillar; larger trucks use a rigid frame system. The ejector uses a 4-cylinder hydraulic ram and blade to dump the material out, a similar system to Cat's wheel tractor-scrapers. The 740 Ejector is sold as separate model from the usual 740.|$|E

"We are keen to {{have that}} debate about whether the time has arrived for us to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> is seamless, easy to pass through, a {{guaranteed}} basic income and where you can {{move in and out}} of work on a regular basis," [...] or [...] "an income support system that means every time you stop work {{you have to go through}} the palaver of stand-down periods, more bureaucracy, more form filling at the same time as you're trying to get into your next job." ...|$|E
50|$|This is {{the minimum}} time elapsed between two {{adjacent}} timestamps. If {{the resolution of}} the timestamp is too large (coarse), the possibility of two or more timestamps being equal is increased and thus enabling some transactions to commit out of correct order. For example, assuming that we <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> can create one hundred unique timestamps per second, and given two events that occur 2 milliseconds apart, they will probably be given the same timestamp even though they actually occurred at different times.|$|E
50|$|When Cathay {{wanted to}} end the company's {{association}} in Hong Kong, Chow left Shaw Brothers to establish Golden Harvest in 1970. Chow capitalized on the Shaw Brothers who <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> limited creativity, {{and was able to}} lure Bruce Lee into Golden Harvest, making it a serious competitor to Shaw Brothers. Under Chow's leadership, Golden Harvest would become the cornerstone for Hong Kong cinema leading HK box office sales for two decades from the 1970s to 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Yoruba law is {{the legal}} system of Yorubaland. It is quite intricate, each group and {{subgroup}} <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> varies, but in general, government begins within the immediate family.

This chief {{will be subject to}} town chiefs, and these chiefs are usually themselves subject to their Oba, {{who may or may not}} be subject to another Oba himself.|$|R
5000|$|From 1958 he {{had worked}} with Cambridge-educated John Twinn in {{developing}} an affordable guided missile that could knock out low-flying aircraft. The Army {{was more interested in}} artillery with proximity fuses. The cost of providing a missile with radar guidance was an expensive solution. The solution was to employ a Command to Line of Sight Guidance System (CLOS), whereby the missile contained no radar. The missile <b>system</b> <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> <b>that</b> optically tracked the aircraft and missile.|$|R
