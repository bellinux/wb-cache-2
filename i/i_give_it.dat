500|$|By 1966, Cardinale {{was being}} {{cited as the}} most popular film star in Italy, even more than Mastroianni and Loren. Life stated that [...] "the Cardinale appeal {{is a blend of}} solid {{simplicity}} and radiant sensuality. It moves men {{all over the world to}} imagine her both as an exciting mistress and wife." [...] However, following her success in Hollywood, she began to express concerns about the direction of her career. In a July 1966 interview with Life, she confessed her fear of being over-glamourized and exploited, like Sophia Loren, and although she had several further U.S. films lined up, stated: [...] "If I have to give up the money, <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> up. I do not want to become a cliché." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing {{began in}} late 2009, when the American singer Holly Hafermann resided at the Artula Retreat in Bandon, Oregon, and {{composed}} songs. Later, in New York City, under her new stage name Skylar Grey, she visited her Universal Music publisher, Jennifer Blakeman, {{to seek help}} presenting her work; Blakeman suggested she collaborate with Alex da Kid. The producer emailed Grey his track, which suggested a theme of abusive romantic relationships {{to her as she}} spontaneously sang lyrics to the melody. She told the Los Angeles Times that she was in an abusive relationship with the music industry: [...] "I love it so much, and <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> all that I have, yet it beats me down." [...] This idea inspired her writing, a process she found came naturally, as if she were creating an alternative pop song for herself. She wrote the chorus to [...] "Love the Way You Lie" [...] in fifteenminutes and recorded vocals for Alex da Kid's demo.|$|E

500|$|A notable {{minority}} of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct {{for a military}} officer. Among some officers' later recounting of the speech, bullshit would be replaced by baloney and fucking by fornicating. At least one account replaced [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the balls" [...] with [...] "We're going to hold the enemy by the nose." [...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate. It was well known {{that the two men}} were polar opposites in personality, and there is considerable evidence that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally. In response to criticisms of his coarse language, Patton wrote to a family member, [...] "When I want my men to remember something important, to really make it stick, <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> to them double dirty. It may not sound nice to a bunch of little old ladies, at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember.

2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} God's promise to Jacob in [...] "The land whereon you lie, to you will <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>it,</b> {{and to your}} seed," [...] caused Jacob to ask Joseph in [...] "Bury me not, I pray, in Egypt." [...] The Midrash taught that God's promise in [...] "The land whereon you lie, to you will <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>it,</b> and to your seed," [...] implied that if Jacob lay in the land, it would be his, but if not, {{it would not be}} his.|$|E

2500|$|Reading [...] "Bury me not, I pray, in Egypt", a Midrash {{explained}} that Jacob wanted his bones {{to be carried}} away from Egypt, lest Jacob's descendants remain there, arguing that Egypt must be a holy land, or Jacob {{would not have been}} buried there. The Midrash taught that Jacob also wanted his family quickly to rejoin him in the Land of Israel, as Jacob trusted God to fulfill God's promise in [...] "He shall turn the heart of the fathers to the children, and the heart of the children to their fathers." [...] Alternatively, a Midrash taught that Jacob feared that when God afflicted the Egyptians with the Plagues, they would surround Jacob's sepulcher and beseech him to intercede for them. If he did intercede, he would be helping God's enemies. If he did not, he would cause God's Name to be profaned by the Egyptians, who would call Jacob's God inefficacious. Alternatively, a Midrash taught that God promised Jacob in [...] "The land whereon you lie, to you will <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>it,</b> and to your seed," [...] (and this implied) that if Jacob lay in the land, it would be his, but if not, it would not be his.|$|E
2500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Good for You" [...] is a torch {{song and}} a come-hither with themes of intensity, psychodrama, {{self-confidence}} and female self-empowerment, with Gomez singing the hook [...] "I just wanna {{look good for}} you, good for you", as a plea. According to the singer, the track [...] "reps women in a good way" [...] and [...] "does something to a woman when they look good". In an interview for People magazine, she stated: [...] "This song represents the confidence that I truly have inside of me, and I think it's the vulnerable side that I've expressed, but it's also the combination of just feeling myself". It was noted to showcase a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than in Gomez's previous releases. A number of the lyrics attribute syllables {{as a means of}} poetry, namely, [...] "leave this dress a mess on the floor" [...] and [...] "syncopate my skin to your heart beating". Gomez's lyrics specifically deal with pleasing and being the perfect complement for her significant other, by means of wearing skin-tight dresses and doing her [...] "hair up real, real nice". Gomez references the Greek myth of Midas and jewelry retailer Tiffany & Co in the lines [...] "Doing it up like Midas, mmm" [...] and [...] "I'm on marquise diamond / I'm a marquise diamond / Could even make that Tiffany jealous, mmm". Gomez's lyrics deal with pleasing her lover and being the perfect complement for him, seen in lyrics as [...] "Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight / Do my hair up real, real nice". The line [...] "You say <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> to you hard / So bad, so bad / Make you never wanna leave / I won't / I won't" [...] represents a shift towards more mature and sexually suggestive subject matter than Gomez's previous releases.|$|E
2500|$|And Sarah died in Kirjath-arba; {{the same}} is Hebron {{in the land of}} Canaan: and Abraham came to mourn for Sarah, and to weep for her. 3 And Abraham stood up from before his dead, and spake unto the sons of Heth, saying, 4 I am a {{stranger}} and a sojourner with you: give me a possession of a burying place with you, that I may bury my dead out of my sight. 5 And the children of Heth answered Abraham, saying unto him, 6 Hear us, my lord: thou art a mighty prince among us: in the choice of our sepulchres bury thy dead; none of us shall withhold from thee his sepulchre, but that thou mayest bury thy dead. 7 And Abraham stood up, and bowed himself {{to the people of the}} land, even to the children of Heth. 8 And he communed with them, saying, If it be your mind that I should bury my dead out of my sight; hear me, and intreat for me to Ephron the son of Zohar, 9 That he may give me the cave of Machpelah, which he hath, which is in the end of his field; for as much money as it is worth he shall give it me for a possession of a buryingplace amongst you. 10 And Ephron dwelt among the children of Heth: and Ephron the Hittite answered Abraham in the audience of the children of Heth, even of all that went in at the gate of his city, saying, 11 Nay, my lord, hear me: the field give I thee, and the cave that is therein, <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>it</b> thee; in the presence of the sons of my people give I it thee: bury thy dead. [...] 16 And Abraham hearkened unto Ephron; and Abraham weighed to Ephron the silver, which he had named in the audience of the sons of Heth, four hundred shekels of silver, current money with the merchant. 17 And the field of Ephron, which was in Machpelah, which was before Mamre, the field, and the cave which was therein, and all the trees that were in the field, that were in all the borders round about, were made sure 18 Unto Abraham for a possession in the presence of the children of Heth, before all that went in at the gate of his city. 19 And after this, Abraham buried Sarah his wife in the cave of the field of Machpelah before Mamre: {{the same is}} Hebron in the land of Canaan. 20 And the field, and the cave that is therein, were made sure unto Abraham for a possession of a buryingplace by the sons of Heth.|$|E

2500|$|Reading the words, [...] "And I {{appeared}} to Abraham, to Isaac, and to Jacob," [...] in [...] a Midrash taught that God thus told Moses that God longed {{for those who}} were gone and could not be replaced – the three Patriarchs. The Midrash said that God told Moses that many times, God had revealed God's Self to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob as God Almighty ( [...] , El Shadai), and God had not made known to them that God's name is the Lord ( [...] , the Tetragrammaton). But still they did not criticize God's ways. To Abraham, God said in [...] "Arise, walk through the land in the length of it and in the breadth of it, for to you will I give it," [...] yet when Abraham wanted to bury Sarah, he found no plot of ground until he had purchased one; still, he did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Isaac in [...] "Sojourn in this land [...] [...] [...] for to you, and to your seed, I will give all these lands." [...] Yet when Isaac sought water to drink, he found none; instead (as [...] reports), [...] "The herdsmen of Gerar strove with Isaac's herdsmen, saying: ‘The water is ours.'" [...] Still Isaac did not murmur at God's ways. God said to Jacob in [...] "The land on which you lie, to you will <b>I</b> <b>give</b> <b>it,</b> and to your seed." [...] Yet when he sought a place to pitch his tent, he found none until he purchased one for a hundred kesitah (as reported in [...] ). And still Jacob did not complain at God's ways. The Patriarchs did not ask God, as Moses did in [...] what God's name was. In contrast, at the commencement of God's commission of Moses, Moses inquired of God's name. And in [...] Moses told God, [...] "For since I came to Pharaoh [...] [...] [...] he has dealt ill with this people; neither have You delivered Your people." [...] On this account, the Midrash taught, God said in [...] "And I have also established my covenant with them," [...] the Patriarchs, to give them the land, and they never complained of God's ways. And God said in [...] "I have heard the groaning of the children of Israel," [...] because they did not complain against God. Although the Israelites of that generation did not conduct themselves righteously, yet God heard their cry on account of the covenant that God had made with the Patriarchs. Hence, it says in [...] "And I have remembered My covenant. Therefore, say to the children of Israel." [...] The Midrash taught that the word [...] "therefore" [...] ( [...] , lachein) in [...] implies an oath, as it does in [...] where God says, [...] "And therefore I have sworn to the house of Eli." [...] Thus, the Midrash taught that God swore to Moses that God would redeem the Israelites, so that Moses would have no reason to fear that the Attribute of Justice would retard their redemption.|$|E
