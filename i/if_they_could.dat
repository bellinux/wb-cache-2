5|$|Texas {{was given}} a {{pre-season}} No.2 ranking (behind defending National Champions University of Southern California) by Sports Illustrated magazine and was also ranked second in the pre-season Associated Press Poll and USA Today Coaches Poll. This created anticipation that Texas might play for the national championship <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> win their road game against Ohio State University and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> snap their five-game losing streak against the Oklahoma Sooners who started the season ranked at No. 7.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy {{has come to be}} known as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, all well and good for them. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could,</b> but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
5|$|Richardson asked <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> use {{something}} like Steven Sykes's dummy railhead which {{had worked so}} well at Misheifa. Barkas answered {{that he intended to}} build a dummy water pipeline to go down south, and to be obviously not ready.|$|E

5|$|The Mellotron {{was used}} by German {{electronic}} band Tangerine Dream through the 1970s, on albums such as Atem (1973), Phaedra (1974), Rubycon (1975), Stratosfear (1976), and Encore (1977). In 1983, the band's Christopher Franke asked Mellotronics <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> produce a digital model, as the group migrated towards using samplers.|$|E
5|$|Despite his father's {{wishes that}} DeLee become a rabbi, DeLee {{attended}} Chicago Medical College. Of particular influence on DeLee was obstetrics professor W. W. Jaggard. He graduated in 1891. Author Charlotte Borst noted {{that most women}} delivered {{at home in the}} 1870s through 1890s; medical students at Northwestern only witnessed deliveries at that time <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> bribe women into having their babies at the hospital's amphitheatre. DeLee felt fortunate to have observed two such births while he was a student.|$|E
5|$|McKellen {{has taken}} his {{activism}} internationally, and caused a major stir in Singapore, where {{he was invited to}} do an interview on a morning show and shocked the interviewer by asking <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> recommend him a gay bar; the programme immediately ended. In December 2008, he was named in Out annual Out 100 list.|$|E
50|$|Colossus (the {{magazine}} of the Finnish Progressive Music Association) invited the 30 bands to write, compose, perform and {{produce their own}} songs for the project, {{they were asked to}} perform in their native language or <b>if</b> <b>they</b> wished <b>they</b> <b>could</b> perform an instrumental piece.|$|R

6000|$|... "No {{doubt it}} is, but the French don't always respect the convents--very much the contrary, indeed.

5|$|The {{success of}} the 2004 team and the efforts during the {{off-season}} fueled anticipation by sports writers that Texas would play for the national championship <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> win their away game against Ohio State University and end their five-game losing streak against Oklahoma. The BCS system required any team competing {{in the championship game}} to be ranked either numberone or numbertwo in the BCS Standings {{at the end of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|A major {{planning}} {{issue was}} {{the need for a}} minicomputer at the station. NDRE argued that it was fully capable of delivering such a system, but NTNF instead wanted to minimize risk by buying the PDP-8 from Digital Equipment Corporation in the United States. However, NDRE was awarded the contract, in part because of NTNF's obligation to support Norwegian technology and in part because NDRE agreed to purchase a suitable foreign computer <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not successfully manufacture one themselves. A new minicomputer, SAM-2, was built at NDRE and completed in April 1967. It was the first computer built in Europe and among the first three in the world which used integrated circuits. SAM-2 was so successful that the developers established Norsk Data to commercialize the technology.|$|E
5|$|A {{new game}} was also {{introduced}} {{on the roof}} of BBC Television Centre called Sacrifice Your Family which Cawood hosted that put two families against each other in various games. This was later renamed Sacrifice Your Friends in 2001. Other features included Talk To The Hand where a celebrity had to answer questions from viewers with the option to only be able to pass one of the questions {{with the use of the}} hand and L Most Wanted where viewers could win prizes <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> spot a three digit number clue placed somewhere throughout the show which was the code to the cage containing the prizes. The winner was the one who guessed the correct order out of a possible six combinations.|$|E

5|$|A senator {{could make}} a brief statement, discuss the matter in detail, or talk about an {{unrelated}} topic. All senators had to speak before a vote could be held, and since all meetings had to end by nightfall, a senator could talk a proposal to death (a filibuster or diem consumere) <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> keep the debate going until nightfall. It is known, for example, that the senator Cato the Younger once filibustered {{in an attempt to}} prevent the Senate from granting Julius Caesar a law that would have given land to the veterans of Pompey.|$|E
5|$|Between 1879 and 1884, Cantor {{published}} {{a series of}} six articles in Mathematische Annalen that together formed an introduction to his set theory. At the same time, there was growing opposition to Cantor's ideas, led by Kronecker, who admitted mathematical concepts only <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be constructed in {{a finite number of}} steps from the natural numbers, which he took as intuitively given. For Kronecker, Cantor's hierarchy of infinities was inadmissible, since accepting the concept of actual infinity would open the door to paradoxes which would challenge the validity of mathematics as a whole. Cantor also introduced the Cantor set during this period.|$|E
5|$|Encouraged by Villa's and Orozco's actions, {{as well as}} the {{outbreak}} of the Zapatista rebellion in Morelos, Madero crossed back into Mexico in February 1911. After a few minor engagements with units of Diaz's army, Madero, Orozco and Villa decided to attack the federal garrison at Ciudad Juárez. <b>If</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> take the city, they would control traffic between Mexico and the US. Furthermore, such a major success by the revolutionaries could very well be the final push that would knock over the Porfiriato.|$|E

5|$|Fan {{interest}} in attending games had begun declining throughout MLB in the late-1940s, and the Yankees faced a drop-off in their crowds after 1947, when they sold about 2.2 million tickets. By 1957, season attendance was down by over 700,000. New York baseball fans {{had the option}} of watching games on television instead by the early 1950s. The Yankees joined the other New York City franchises in allowing game telecasts. This was a departure from the team's strategy when radio broadcasts were introduced. Regular season games of the Yankees were not broadcast until 1939, as management believed that fewer fans would attend games <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> listen on radios.|$|E
5|$|Following the letters, Jackson {{received}} a parcel containing {{a photograph of}} the fan, as well as a letter and a gun. Jackson was horrified; the letter asked that the pop singer kill himself on a certain day and at a specific time. The fan would do the same once she had killed their baby. She wrote that <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be together in this life, then they would be in the next. To his mother's dismay, Jackson had the photograph of the woman framed and hung above the dining room table of their family home. Afterwards, the Jacksons discovered that the fan had been sent to a psychiatric hospital.|$|E
5|$|Hoping {{to attract}} a {{proposed}} ZAP electric vehicle manufacturing plant {{to the city of}} Franklin, Kentucky, Beshear issued an executive order permitting low-speed vehicles on many Kentucky roads in August 2008. The state also offered the company $48 million in tax incentives, contingent upon its delivering a promised 4,000 jobs. Construction of the proposed plant stalled, however, when GE Capital, a primary investor, pulled out of the project. ZAP officials maintained their intention to build the plant, but said they would also consider other states' proposals <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not replace the $125 million commitment from GE.|$|E

25|$|When placed {{close to}} a wall or {{touching}} it, altars were often surmounted by a reredos or altarpiece. <b>If</b> free-standing, <b>they</b> <b>could</b> be placed, as also in Eastern Christianity, within a ciborium (sometimes called a baldachin).|$|R
5|$|In 1694, two Franciscan friars set {{out from}} Guatemala to see <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> succeed where the Dominicans had failed. Antonio Margil and Melchor López left Cobán in August 1693 {{to seek out the}} hostile Lakandon Ch'ols {{in the depths of the}} rainforest. Antionio Margil had already spent two years among the Manche Ch'ol. Although they found the Lakandon, the mission was a failure and the friars were forced to flee. Disappointed by their failure, in April 1694 the friars wrote a letter to the {{president}} of the Audiencia Real of Guatemala, Jacinto de Barrios Leal, stating their belief that any further peaceful attempts at converting the Ch'ol peoples were pointless, and that the time had come for military action.|$|E
5|$|Neptune {{was built}} {{during the early}} years of the war with Revolutionary France and was {{launched}} in 1797. She almost immediately became caught up in the events of the mutiny at the Nore, and was one of a few loyal ships tasked with attacking mutinous vessels <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> not be brought to order. The mutiny died out before this became necessary and Neptune joined the Channel Fleet. She moved to the Mediterranean in 1799, spending the rest of the French Revolutionary Wars in operations with Vice-Admiral Lord Keith's fleet. After refitting, and spending time on blockades, she formed part of Lord Nelson's fleet at the Battle of Trafalgar, and was heavily involved in the fighting, sustaining casualties of 10 killed and 34 wounded.|$|E
5|$|On 21 February 1940, John Randall and Harry Boot first ran their cavity {{magnetron}} at 10cm (3GHz). In April, GEC was told {{of their work}} and asked <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>could</b> improve the design. They introduced new sealing methods and an improved cathode, delivering two examples capable of generating 10kW of power at 10cm, {{an order of magnitude}} better than any existing microwave device. At this wavelength, a half-dipole antenna was only a few centimetres long, and allowed Lovell's team to begin looking at parabolic reflectors, producing a beam only 5 degrees wide. This had the enormous advantage of avoiding ground reflections by simply not pointing the antenna downwards, allowing the fighter to see any target at its altitude or above it.|$|E
5000|$|Some advance {{publicity}} for the album reported its title as ...at the Moment of our Most Needing or <b>If</b> Only <b>They</b> <b>Could</b> Turn Around, <b>They</b> Would Know They Weren't Alone, but its actual title upon release was just ...at {{the moment of}} our most needing.
