5|$|News of Clark's victory reached General <b>George</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>and</b> {{his success}} was celebrated {{and was used}} to {{encourage}} the alliance with France. General Washington recognized that Clark's achievement had been gained without support from the regular army in men or funds.

The bridge also served as a point of refuge, particularly for Connecticut's Blue Law offenders, where once on the left bank of the river, they could easily cross to the New York border. State authorities would not go through the extradition process, leaving them safe.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the approval of the}} new five-cent coin, the Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, had begun preparing designs and pattern coins in 1865. After rejecting pieces showing deceased presidents <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> Abraham Lincoln, Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch decided on a design similar to Longacre's two-cent piece, with a shield on the obverse and a numeral 5 surrounded by stars and rays on the reverse. This {{has come to be known}} as the Shield nickel.|$|E
5|$|In late December 1776, Morris {{completed}} {{his commitment to}} the Connecticut militia and immediately accepted a commission in the Continental Army as a first lieutenant. After serving as a recruiting officer in Litchfield, Morris joined General <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> the army at Peekskill. On October 3, 1776, General Washington commanded this army in the Battle of Germantown. The American forces were ultimately unsuccessful in this battle and Morris was taken as a prisoner of war on October 4, 1776.|$|E

5|$|USS Theodore Roosevelt {{and later}} {{carriers}} have slight structural differences {{from the earlier}} Nimitz carriers such as improved protection for ordnance stored in their magazines. Other improvements include upgraded flight deck ballistic protection, first installed on USS <b>George</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>and</b> the high-strength low-alloy steel (HSLA-100) used for constructing ships starting with USS John C. Stennis. More recently, older ships have had their flight decks upgraded with a new non-slip material fitted on new-build ships, to improve safety for both crew members and aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Duke of Marmalade {{was one of}} {{the last}} crop of foals sired by Danehill one of the most {{successful}} stallions of the last twenty years, producing the winners of more than a thousand races, including one hundred and fifty-six at Group One/Grade I level. Among his best offspring are Dylan Thomas, Rock of Gibraltar, <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> North Light. Love Me True is a half-sister to Shuailaan (Winter Hill Stakes), Madison's Charm (Comely Stakes) and Bite The Bullet (Sanford Stakes), and, as a granddaughter of Lassie Dear, is closely related to Summer Squall, A. P. Indy and Lemon Drop Kid.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, {{the ship}} was re-commissioned by the U.S. Navy as USS Catlin (AP-19) {{for about six months}} and was {{operated}} by the British under Lend-Lease, but her old coal-fired engines were too slow for effective combat use. After conversion to oil-fired boilers, {{the ship was}} chartered to the U.S. Army as USAT <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> sailed around the world in 1943 in trooping duties. The ship sailed in regular service to the United Kingdom and the Mediterranean from 1944 to 1947, and was laid up in Baltimore after ending her Army service. A fire in January 1951 damaged the ship severely, and she was sold for scrapping the following month.|$|E

5|$|Jones {{served as}} Clerk of Court for Hampshire County, Virginia (now West Virginia) for a tenure lasting 25 years (1757–1782) and {{represented}} Frederick, Hampshire, and Augusta counties {{as a member}} of the House of Burgesses of Virginia. In addition, Jones also served as the King's Attorney for Augusta County and as the coroner for Frederick County. He was elected to represent Virginia at the Continental Congress but did not attend, and was elected to represent Rockingham County in the Virginia Ratifying Convention. Jones was an uncle of American pioneer John Gabriel Jones (1752–1776), and he was a friend of both <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> Thomas Fairfax, 6th Lord Fairfax of Cameron.|$|E
5|$|More {{than half}} of the delegates had trained as lawyers (several had even been judges), {{although}} only about a quarter had practiced law as their principal means of business. There were also merchants, manufacturers, shippers, land speculators, bankers or financiers, two or three physicians, a minister, and several small farmers. Of the twenty-five who owned slaves, sixteen depended on slave labor to run the plantations or other businesses that formed the mainstay of their income. Most of the delegates were landowners with substantial holdings, and most, {{with the possible exception of}} Roger Sherman and William Few, were very comfortably wealthy. <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> Robert Morris were among the wealthiest men in the entire country.|$|E
5|$|On 13 December 10 battleships, {{including}} Nevada, and 28 destroyers escorted {{the ocean}} liner , with president Woodrow Wilson embarked, into Brest, France, {{during the last}} day of Wilson's journey to the country so he could attend the Paris Peace Conference. The flotilla met <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> her escorts (Pennsylvania and four destroyers) just off Brest and escorted them into the port. The 10 battleships sailed for home at 14:00 on the next day, 14 December. They took less than two weeks to cross the Atlantic, and arrived in New York on 26 December to parades and celebrations.|$|E

5|$|On May 21, 1787, William Samuel Johnson, {{the son of}} Dr. Samuel Johnson, was {{unanimously}} elected President of Columbia College. Prior {{to serving}} at the university, Johnson {{had participated in the}} First Continental Congress and been chosen as a delegate to the Constitutional Convention. For a period in the 1790s, with New York City as the federal and state capital and the country under successive Federalist governments, a revived Columbia thrived under the auspices of Federalists such as Hamilton and Jay. Both President <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> Vice President John Adams attended the college's commencement on May 6, 1789, as a tribute of honor to the many alumni of the school who had been involved in the American Revolution.|$|E
5|$|SS George Washington was {{an ocean}} liner built in 1908 for the Bremen-based North German Lloyd {{and was named}} after George Washington, the first President of the United States. The ship was also known as USS George Washington (ID-3018) and USAT George Washington in service of the United States Navy and United States Army, respectively, during World War I. In the interwar period, she reverted to her {{original}} name of SS George Washington. During World War II, the ship was known as both USAT <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and,</b> briefly, as USS Catlin (AP-19), in a short, second stint in the U.S. Navy.|$|E
5|$|Scott {{spent most}} of 1759 {{conducting}} escort missions and constructing roads and forts. During this time, Virginia's forces were taken from <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> put {{under the control of}} Colonel William Byrd. In July 1760, Scott was named the fifth captain of a group of Virginia troops that Byrd led on an expedition against the Cherokee in 1760. Scott's exact role in the campaign is not known. The expedition was a success, and Virginia Governor Francis Fauquier ordered the force disbanded in February 1762; Scott had left the army at some unknown date prior to that.|$|E

5|$|The {{monument}} underwent {{an extensive}} restoration project between 1998 and 2001. During {{this time it}} was completely covered in scaffolding designed by the American architect Michael Graves (who was also responsible for the interior changes). The project included cleaning, repairing and repointing the monument's exterior and interior stonework. The stone in publicly accessible interior spaces was encased in glass to prevent vandalism, while new windows with narrower frames were installed (to increase the viewing space). New exhibits celebrating the life of <b>George</b> <b>Washington,</b> <b>and</b> the monument's place in history, were also added.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{designer}} of the coin is unknown, artist Gilbert Stuart is widely acknowledged to have been its creator; Mint Director James Ross Snowden began researching {{the early history of}} the United States Mint and its coinage in the 1850s, during which time he interviewed descendants of Stuart who claimed that their ancestor was {{the designer}}. It has been suggested that Philadelphia socialite Ann Willing Bingham posed as the model for the coin. Several sketches were approved by Mint engraver Robert Scot and de Saussure and sent to President <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson to gain their approval.|$|E
5|$|When the American Revolutionary War began, George Washington was {{selected}} to head the colonial army. During the war, the capital was moved to Richmond {{at the urging of}} Governor Thomas Jefferson, who feared that Williamsburg's coastal location would make it vulnerable to British attack. In 1781, the combined action of Continental and French land and naval forces trapped the British army on the Virginia Peninsula, where troops under <b>George</b> <b>Washington</b> <b>and</b> Comte de Rochambeau defeated British General Cornwallis in the Siege of Yorktown. His surrender on October 19, 1781 led to peace negotiations in Paris and secured the independence of the colonies.|$|E
