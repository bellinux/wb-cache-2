50|$|The South Australian Country Fire Service have an <b>Infra-Red</b> <b>Beacon</b> on {{the roof}} of most new {{appliances}} and the vehicle call sign. As all trucks are named and numbered according to their location, capacity and capability (e.g. Hynam 34, Location: Hynam, 3000L, 4WD or Belair 34P, Location Belair, 3000L, 4WD, Pumper), their call sign is also placed {{on the roof}} of the cab in a red text on white roof fashion. Older State Emergency Service vehicles, primarily in country areas, may have their call sign on the roof as well.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a method for}} automatically recharging the batteries on a mobile robot. The robot used in this project is the Nomadic Technologies? Nomad XR 4000 mobile robot. The battery recharging system was implemented using the robot's built-in sensors to control docking with a simple recharging station. The recharging station has an AC power plug, an <b>infra-red</b> <b>beacon</b> and a target designed for detection by the Sick Laser Range Finder. The robot's IR sensors perform the beacon detection. The robot moves towards the beacon until the laser target pattern is visible to the Sick laser. The system is currently under development and undergoing its performance testing. 1 Introduction A mobile robot is being prepared at the Australian National University for teleoperation using a Webbrowser from the Internet. It is intended that the robot {{will be available to}} operators continuously with only occasional local intervention required. With a battery life of approximately 6 [...] ...|$|E
50|$|Before the First World War the French {{introduced}} the collimateur. During that war the British {{introduced the}}ir first parallescope, {{which was a}} horizontal mirror placed {{a few feet from}} the gun; the layer aimed his sight at its reflection. In the 1950s the parallescope was replaced by the prism parallescope that was more robust and easily positioned. In the 1970s the US introduced a modern version of the French device and called it a collimator. In the same period <b>infra-red</b> <b>beacons</b> had some very limited use.|$|R
50|$|Among {{the many}} {{tactical}} innovations {{introduced by the}} Centre, codified in the Manual on Combined Operations and the Standard Naval Bombardment Code, {{was the use of}} Floating Piers (pontoons) to bridge the water gap, the creation of Smoke Generating devices to obscure the assault and the use of <b>infra-red</b> directional <b>beacons</b> for landing accuracy. The Centre also {{played a role in the}} development of the first specialized landing crafts, including the Assault Landing Craft, the Mechanized Landing Craft (LCM(1)), the Landing Craft Tank (Mk. 1), Support Landing Craft LCS(1), LCS(2) and Landing Ship Infantry.|$|R
40|$|Accurate {{and safe}} proton beam {{delivery}} {{is one of}} the most crucial tasks during Proton Therapy (PT) of ocular melanoma. The eye movement and gaze angle tracking system should be able to monitor in real time the eye position and orientation (6 degree of freedom) to exactly localize the tumor location inside the eye with respect to the proton beam. The system should also immediately switch the beam off if the tumor goes out of the irradiated area to protect vital organs and keep the non affected cells healthy. The non-invasive eye-tracking system will replace the painful surgical procedure of implantation of radio-opaque tantalum clips on the eye. In order to estimate accurately enough the eye gaze angle and torsion, a stereo imaging system consisting of two high-resolution imaging cameras and two <b>infra-red</b> <b>beacons</b> can be used. The six coordinates of the eye are extracted by image analysis of the acquired stereo camera images using the beacons reflections (glints) and location of the eye pupil. The accuracy of the method can be affected by motion artifacts and difficulty of pupil segmentation in some eyes. Further, the method is inclusive to cyclo-torsion (rotation of the eye about its optical axis). The eye-tracking system can thus benefit from motion artifacts suppression and implementation of analysis of the eye surface features, e. g. iris pattern. Another addition is to use steerable mounts and mirrors to improve measurements and, thus, eye tracking accuracy. The goal of this thesis is to build a prototype stereo eye-tracking system, write a tracking code and investigate the viability of this method for further improving eye tracking accuracy...|$|R
