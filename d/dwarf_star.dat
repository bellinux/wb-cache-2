5|$|A slow-rotating white <b>dwarf</b> <b>star</b> can {{not exceed}} the Chandrasekhar limit of 1.44 solar masses without {{collapsing}} to form a neutron star or exploding as a Type Ia supernova. Once the white dwarf reaches this mass, such as by accretion or collision, the gravitational force would exceed the pressure exerted by the electrons. If the white dwarf is rotating rapidly, however, the effective gravity is diminished in the equatorial region, thus allowing the white dwarf to exceed the Chandrasekhar limit. Such rapid rotation can occur, for example, {{as a result of}} mass accretion that results in a transfer of angular momentum.|$|E
5|$|After fusing helium in {{its core}} to carbon, the Sun {{will begin to}} {{collapse}} again, evolving into a compact white <b>dwarf</b> <b>star</b> after ejecting its outer atmosphere as a planetary nebula. In 50 billion years, if the Earth and Moon are not engulfed by the Sun, they will become tidelocked, with each showing only one face to the other. Thereafter, the tidal action of the Sun will extract angular momentum from the system, causing the lunar orbit to decay and the Earth's spin to accelerate.|$|E
5|$|At Princeton University, Henry Norris Russell was {{following}} a similar course of research.

For this purpose he used a set of stars that had reliable parallaxes and many of which had been categorized at Harvard. When he plotted the spectral types of these stars against their absolute magnitude, he found that dwarf stars followed a distinct relationship. This allowed the real brightness of a <b>dwarf</b> <b>star</b> to be predicted with reasonable accuracy.|$|E

A third class of stars, subdwarfs, is addressed as a potential problem in future surveys. Some suggestions for detecting and removing these contaminating stars from the data are offered.

5|$|As a start, the {{spectrum}} of HAT-P-33 was composed using the digital speedometer at the 1.5-meter Fred Lawrence Whipple Observatory in Arizona. The collected data found that the star was a single <b>dwarf</b> <b>star</b> exhibiting a slight rotation. Several of its parameters, including its effective temperature and surface gravity, were found. Additionally, the SOPHIE échelle spectrograph at a 1.93-meter telescope at France's Haute-Provence Observatory was used to observe the star. The resulting data invited the possibility that radial velocity measurements, which can exhibit anomalies that often indicate {{the presence of a}} planet, may have been because of background distortion (and not a planet). This possibility significantly complicated the ability of scientists to verify this planet. After the observations, follow-ups were postponed for several years.|$|E
5|$|Following a {{supernova}} explosion, the {{remnant of the}} donor star (IK Pegasus A) would continue with the final velocity it possessed {{when it was a}} member of a close orbiting binary system. The resulting relative velocity could be as high as 100–200km/s, which would place it among the high-velocity members of the galaxy. The companion will also have lost some mass during the explosion, and its presence may create a gap in the expanding debris. From that point forward it will evolve into a single white <b>dwarf</b> <b>star.</b> The supernova explosion will create a remnant of expanding material that will eventually merge with the surrounding interstellar medium.|$|E

The system is an X-ray nova, meaning that it experiences periodic outbursts in the X-ray band of the electromagnetic spectrum. If the system does indeed contain a black hole, {{it would be the}} smallest one ever recorded. Further analysis in 2012 calculated a mass of 2.1 solar masses, which raises questions as to what the object actually is as it appears to be too small to be a black hole.|$|E
