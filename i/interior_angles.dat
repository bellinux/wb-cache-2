The dart may be bisected {{along its}} {{axis of symmetry}} to form a pair of obtuse Robinson triangles (with angles of 36, 36 and 108 degrees), which are smaller than the acute triangles.|$|E

25|$|An angle {{that is part}} of {{a simple}} polygon is called an <b>interior</b> <b>angle</b> if it lies on the inside of that simple polygon. A simple concave polygon has at least one <b>interior</b> <b>angle</b> that is a reflex angle.|$|R
50|$|F1 and F2 are the foci of the lemniscate, O is the {{midpoint}} of the line segment F1F2 and P is any point on the lemniscate outside the line connecting F1 and F2. The normal n of the lemniscate in P intersects the line connecting F1 and F2 in R. Now the <b>interior</b> <b>angle</b> of the triangle OPR at O is one third of the triangle's exterior angle at R. In addition the <b>interior</b> <b>angle</b> at P is twice the <b>interior</b> <b>angle</b> at O.|$|R
25|$|Rectilinear: the polygon's sides meet {{at right}} angles, i.e., all its <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> are 90 or 270 degrees.|$|E
25|$|A {{triangle}} {{with all}} <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> measuring less than 90° is an acute triangle or acute-angled triangle. If c is {{the length of}} the longest side, then , where a and b are the lengths of the other sides.|$|E
25|$|The {{sum of the}} {{measures}} of the <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> of a triangle in Euclidean space is always 180 degrees. This fact is equivalent to Euclid's parallel postulate. This allows determination of {{the measure of the}} third angle of any triangle given the measure of two angles. An exterior angle of a triangle is an angle that is a linear pair (and hence supplementary) to an interior angle. The measure of an exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of {{the measures}} of the two <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> that are not adjacent to it; this is the exterior angle theorem. The sum of the measures of the three exterior angles (one for each vertex) of any triangle is 360 degrees.|$|E

2500|$|A {{triangle}} with an <b>interior</b> <b>angle</b> of 180° (and [...] vertices) is degenerate.|$|R
25|$|Convex: any line {{drawn through}} the polygon (and not tangent to an edge or corner) meets its {{boundary}} exactly twice. As a consequence, all its <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> {{are less than}} 180°. Equivalently, any line segment with endpoints on the boundary passes through only interior points between its endpoints.|$|E
25|$|The sum of {{the angles}} of a {{triangle}} is equal to a straight angle (180 degrees). This causes an equilateral triangle to have 3 <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> of 60 degrees. Also, it causes every triangle {{to have at least}} 2 acute angles and up to 1 obtuse or right angle.|$|E
25|$|If a {{straight}} line falls on two straight lines {{in such a manner}} that the <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> on the same side are together less than two right angles, then the straight lines, if produced indefinitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two right angles.|$|E

25|$|If two {{straight}} lines {{in a plane}} are crossed by another straight line (called the transversal), and the <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> between the two lines and the transversal lying {{on one side of}} the transversal add up to less than two right angles, then on that side of the transversal, the two lines extended will intersect (also called the parallel postulate).|$|E
25|$|When {{considering}} polyhedra as a spherical tiling, this restriction may be relaxed, since digons (2-gons) can {{be represented}} as spherical lunes, having non-zero area. Allowing m = 2 admits a new infinite class of regular polyhedra, which are the hosohedra. On a spherical surface, the regular polyhedron {2,n} is represented as n abutting lunes, with <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> of 2π/n. All these lunes share two common vertices.|$|E
25|$|Many theorems from {{classical}} geometry {{hold true}} for spherical geometry as well, {{but not all}} do because the sphere fails to satisfy some of classical geometry's postulates, including the parallel postulate. In spherical trigonometry, angles are defined between great circles. Spherical trigonometry differs from ordinary trigonometry in many respects. For example, {{the sum of the}} <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> of a spherical triangle always exceeds 180degrees. Also, any two similar spherical triangles are congruent.|$|E

50|$|The bisectors of two {{exterior}} angles and the bisector {{of the other}} <b>interior</b> <b>angle</b> are concurrent.|$|R
25|$|One way {{in which}} {{elliptic}} geometry differs from Euclidean geometry is that {{the sum of the}} <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> of a triangle is greater than 180degrees. In the spherical model, for example, a triangle can be constructed with vertices at the locations where the three positive Cartesian coordinate axes intersect the sphere, and all three of its internal angles are 90degrees, summing to 270degrees. For sufficiently small triangles, the excess over 180degrees can be made arbitrarily small.|$|E
25|$|Euclid {{believed}} that his axioms were self-evident statements about physical reality. Euclid's proofs depend upon assumptions perhaps not obvious in Euclid's fundamental axioms, {{in particular that}} certain movements of figures do not change their geometrical properties such as the lengths of sides and <b>interior</b> <b>angles,</b> the so-called Euclidean motions, which include translations, reflections and rotations of figures. Taken as a physical description of space, postulate 2 (extending a line) asserts that space does not have holes or boundaries (in other words, space is homogeneous and unbounded); postulate 4 (equality of right angles) says that space is isotropic and figures may be moved to any location while maintaining congruence; and postulate 5 (the parallel postulate) that space is flat (has no intrinsic curvature).|$|E
25|$|Einstein's {{theory of}} general {{relativity}} shows that the true geometry of spacetime is not Euclidean geometry. For example, if a triangle is constructed out of three rays of light, then in general the <b>interior</b> <b>angles</b> do {{not add up to}} 180 degrees due to gravity. A relatively weak gravitational field, such as the Earth's or the sun's, is represented by a metric that is approximately, but not exactly, Euclidean. Until the 20th century, there was no technology capable of detecting the deviations from Euclidean geometry, but Einstein predicted that such deviations would exist. They were later verified by observations such as the slight bending of starlight by the Sun during a solar eclipse in 1919, and such considerations are now {{an integral part of the}} software that runs the GPS system. It is possible to object to this interpretation {{of general relativity}} on the grounds that light rays might be improper physical models of Euclid's lines, or that relativity could be rephrased so as to avoid the geometrical interpretations. However, one of the consequences of Einstein's theory is that there is no possible physical test that can distinguish between a beam of light as a model of a geometrical line and any other physical model. Thus, the only logical possibilities are to accept non-Euclidean geometry as physically real, or to reject the entire notion of physical tests of the axioms of geometry, which can then be imagined as a formal system without any intrinsic real-world meaning.|$|E
