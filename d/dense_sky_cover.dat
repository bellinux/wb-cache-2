Descriptions of two different types of sky-imaging systems developed by the authors are presented, one of which has been developed into a commercially available instrument. Retrievals of fractional <b>sky</b> <b>cover</b> from automated processing methods are compared to human retrievals, both from direct observations and visual analyses of sky images. Although some uncertainty exists in fractional <b>sky</b> <b>cover</b> retrievals from <b>sky</b> images, this uncertainty is no greater than that attached to human observations for the commercially available sky-imager retrievals.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 Temporal {{and spatial}} {{patterns}} of daytime cloudiness in the Willamette Valley of Oregon were studied by utilizing monthly and daily <b>sky</b> <b>cover</b> data {{published by the}} U. S. Weather Bureau for the Portland, Salem, and Eugene stations. The 15 -year period, 1949 through 1963, {{was selected as the}} maximum reliable period length common to all three stations for accurate comparisons, for in the latter 1940 's hourly observations of the number of tenths of the sky field of view obscurred by cloud cover for the time between sunrise and sunset were initiated. The measures of cloudiness used in this study, each of which is based on <b>sky</b> <b>cover</b> in tenths, include: 1. Percent <b>sky</b> <b>cover.</b> 2. Clear and cloudy days (0 - 5 and 6 - 10 tenths). 3. Cloudless and overcast days (0 and 10 tenths). 4. Clear, partly cloudy, and cloudy days (0 - 3, 4 - 7, and 8 - 10 tenths, respectively). The average annual and monthly <b>sky</b> <b>cover</b> in tenths and the number of clear, partly cloudy, and cloudy days can be ascertained directly from Weather Bureau data sources. The principal objectives of this study, however, include the comparison of cloudiness among stations and data presentation which affords a more revealing image of the character of cloudiness. To achieve the latter, variation, persistence, and a range of temporal frameworks were employed as well as the liberal use of graphs and tables. The Willamette Valley averages nearly 70 percent <b>sky</b> <b>cover</b> annually, and only July, August and September average less than 60 percent <b>sky</b> <b>cover.</b> During most months the three stations compare closely in the amount of cloudiness. In July and August, however, Portland averages ten percent more cloudiness than Eugene, and Salem has intermediate cloudiness characteristics. Although overall annual cloudiness in the Willamette Valley may fluctuate as much as 15 percent between extremes, the three stations tend to be affected by the same cloudiness patterns for a given year. The winter half of the year, which is characteristically quite cloudy, shows the least variation in cloudiness, but the late spring and summer show monthly ranges between extremes approaching 50 percent <b>sky</b> <b>cover.</b> The duration of periods of specified amounts of cloudiness indicates frequent changes in the amount of cloudiness, although exceptionally long periods of cloudy weather in winter have occurred. The three stations experience the same periods of cloudiness throughout the year. Contrasts in the persistence of cloudiness among stations, however, are primarily reflected in the summer when Eugene has somewhat longer lasting periods of clear weather than Portland. Partial cloudiness tends to be a transitional rather than persistent cloudiness characteristic, for, despite the overall considerable cloudiness in the Willamette Valley, most clear (0 - 5 tenths) days that do occur tend to be cloudless or have only scattered cloudiness...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} an {{evolving}} luminosity function (LF) {{on the ability}} of foreground galaxies to obscure background sources is discussed, using the Press-Schechter/CDM standard evolving LF model. Galaxies are modeled as simplified versions of local spirals and Poisson statistics are used to estimate the fraction of <b>sky</b> <b>covered</b> by intervening dusty galaxies and the mean optical depths due to these galaxies. The results are compared to those obtained in the case of nonevolving luminosity function in a low-density universe. It is found that evolution of the galaxy LF does not allow the quasar dust obscuration hypothesis to be sustained for dust disks with plausible sizes. Even in a low-density universe, where evolution at z = less than 10 is unimportant, large disk radii are needed to achieve the desired obscuring effect.

40|$|A global {{cloud cover}} data set, {{derived from the}} USAF 3 D NEPH Analysis, was {{developed}} for use in climate studies and for Earth viewing applications. This data set contains a single parameter - total <b>sky</b> <b>cover</b> - separated in time by 3 or 6 hr intervals and in space by approximately 50 n. mi. Cloud cover amount is recorded for each grid point (of a square grid) by a single alphanumeric character representing each 5 percent increment of <b>sky</b> <b>cover.</b> The data are arranged in both quarterly and monthly formats. The data base currently provides daily, 3 -hr observed total <b>sky</b> <b>cover</b> for the Northern Hemisphere from 1972 through 1977 less 1976. For the Southern Hemisphere, there are data at 6 -hr intervals for 1976 through 1978 and at 3 -hr intervals for 1979 and 1980. More years of data are being added. To validate the data base, the percent frequency of or = 0. 3 and or = 0. 8 cloud cover was compared with ground observed cloud amounts at several locations with generally good agreement. Mean or other desired cloud amounts can be calculated for any time period and any size area from a single grid point to a hemisphere. The data base is especially useful in evaluating the consequence of cloud cover on Earth viewing space missions. The temporal and spatial frequency of the data allow simulations that closely approximate any projected viewing mission. No adjustments are required to account for cloud continuity...|$|R

5|$|Along {{with wind}} direction, cloud cover {{is one of}} the oldest {{atmospheric}} conditions to be coded on a station model. The circle in the middle of the station model represents cloud cover. In the United Kingdom, when the observation is taken from an automated weather observation site, the shape is a triangle. If the shape is completely filled in, it is overcast. If conditions are completely clear, the circle or triangle is empty. If conditions are partly cloudy, the circle or triangle is partially filled in. The cloud cover shape has different looks depending upon how many oktas (eighths of the <b>sky)</b> are <b>covered</b> by cloud. A sky half full of clouds would have a circle that was half white and half black.

Simulation studies are carried out to validate the proposed model for shortterm SPP by using the data obtained from the National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB). The performance of the RBF neural network is {{compared with that of}} two linear regression models, i. e., an autoregressive (AR) model and a local linear regression (LLR) model.
