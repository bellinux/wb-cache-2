5|$|After {{the initial}} boom had ended, {{explicitly}} anti-foreign and racist attacks, laws and confiscatory taxes sought {{to drive out}} foreigners—not just Native Americans—from the mines, especially the Chinese and Latin American immigrants mostly from Sonora, Mexico and Chile. The toll on the American immigrants was severe as well: one in twelve forty-niners perished, as the death and crime rates during the Gold Rush were extraordinarily high, and the resulting vigilantism also took <b>its</b> <b>toll.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although Robson {{had signed}} professionally, his father insisted he {{continue}} to work as an electrician. He spent the day working at the Festival of Britain site and trained {{three nights a week}} at Fulham. Eventually, this took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Robson and he gave up his trade for full-time professional football.|$|E
5|$|In April, Austrian forces {{approached}} Mantua {{and started}} their siege. At first, the Austrians were content to simply blockade the fortress, {{but with the}} artillery duels and occasional skirmishes, attrition began taking <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on the defenders. The defenders were also weakened by diminishing food supplies, and their morale was undermined by lack of payment.|$|E

50|$|For {{much of its}} 390-year life span, The Bridge carried all pedestrian, {{livestock}} and horse-drawn traffic across the river, and (as late as 1762) <b>its</b> <b>tolls</b> and chapel were still in use.|$|R
5|$|The deal {{included}} a 99-year lease agreement with unlimited {{control over the}} highway and <b>its</b> <b>tolls,</b> dependent on traffic volume; however, the government maintains the right to build a transport system within the highway right-of-way.|$|R
5|$|On July 4, 1916, the Webb {{house was}} {{opened to the}} public with a 25 cent {{admission}} charge, but the American entry into World War I and the rationing of gasoline took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Nutting's business. Nutting sold the house in 1919 to The National Society of the Colonial Dames of America in Connecticut, which opened it to the public as a historic house museum.|$|E
5|$|Proposals in January 2013 {{to improve}} the bus service to the airport {{involving}} turning emergency lanes into bus lanes on the freeway and the Bolte Bridge and putting SkyBus on a myki fare, were challenged by CityLink operator Transurban, because it would limit <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> revenue, and by Melbourne Airport, because it would reduce its car parking profits. Similar objections would apply to a rail link.|$|E
5|$|The Great Depression took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on the congregation, and {{membership}} dropped. In order {{to cope with}} the financial burdens, dues were raised, teachers were given endorsed notes rather than paychecks, the Executive Secretary was laid off, pews were sold, and individual members provided mortgage guarantees. The synagogue survived, {{and membership}} recovered; by 1934 there were 300 members, and by 1944 there were 1,100.|$|E

5|$|An illness {{during the}} winter of 1913–14 took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Kilner {{at the start of the}} 1914 season. He passed 1,000 runs for the second time but due to his {{uncertain}} form, his aggregate of runs and his average both fell. He scored 1,329 runs (average 30.90), placing him fourth in the Yorkshire batting averages. His bowling was rarely used and he took just one wicket. Kilner scored his second first-class century against Gloucestershire late in the season; he made 169 in nearly three and a half hours, hitting 28 fours. Yorkshire fell to fourth in the championship.|$|E
5|$|Despite Oklahoma's role in instigating the {{construction}} of the Kansas Turnpike, its plans for a connecting turnpike fell through. The Oklahoma Turnpike Authority (OTA) had not performed a traffic study, as KTA had, to prove that the proposed Oklahoma turnpike would be profitable. Oklahoma also suffered from a poorer credit rating than did Kansas. Additionally, by this time many states' turnpike authorities were competing in the bond markets for investor dollars. All of these issues combined made it difficult for OTA to issue bonds for <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> road. When funding had been obtained, political issues stalled the proposed toll road further.|$|E
5|$|Despite the affairs, Sharaf writes that, as the {{newspaper}} campaign against Reich gained pace, he developed an intense jealousy toward Lindenberg, demanding that she {{not have a}} separate life of any kind. He even physically assaulted a composer with whom she was working. Lindenberg considered calling the police but decided Reich could not afford another scandal. His behaviour took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on their relationship, and when Reich asked her to accompany him to the United States, she said no.|$|E

50|$|The Turnpike trust had two {{tollgate}}s at Earl Shilton. One at {{the bottom}} of Shilton Hill, which was kept by a man called Harrison for many years. The other tollgate was where the Belle Vue road meets the Hinckley road. Travellers were said to have gone around by Elmesthorpe to avoid the gate and <b>its</b> <b>tolls.</b>|$|R
5|$|Hurricane Philippe {{initially}} {{formed to}} the east of the Lesser Antilles on September 17 and moved to the north strengthening as it did so. Philippe became a hurricane on September 18 and stayed as such for two days before increasing wind shear from a non-tropical system took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on September 20 and weakened Philippe into a tropical storm. Philippe continued to weaken as it looped around this low and was absorbed by it on September 23.|$|E
5|$|Julia {{consisted}} of mainly a low-level swirl of clouds by late on September16; however, minimal convection kept the storm at the minimum requirements for a tropical cyclone. Early on September17, Julia weakened to a tropical depression. Despite {{a slight increase}} in convection and organization, wind shear and dry air continued to take <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on the increasingly ill-defined storm, and Julia degenerated into a remnant low by early on September 19 after being devoid of convection for nearly 12hours. While moving north, the remnants of Julia then transitioned into a weak extratropical cyclone and made a small westward turn before dissipating inland over North Carolina on September21.|$|E
5|$|On March 24, 1917, Baker {{played his}} last hockey {{game at the}} Winter Garden at Exposition Hall in Pittsburgh. The game pitted an amateur all-star team from Philadelphia, led by Baker, against an all-star team from Pittsburgh's amateur leagues. The Philadelphia team {{defeated}} Pittsburgh in overtime by a score of 3–2. Baker scored all three Philadelphia goals to net a hat trick. Baker began to tire of playing hockey after 1915; the constant physical play of opposing players on the ice had taken <b>its</b> <b>toll,</b> and the growing professionalism of the sport went against his belief that sports should be played {{for the love of}} the game.|$|E

5000|$|The Monkland Canal {{had opened}} in 1794, and {{provided}} a considerable stimulus to the coalpits in Monkland, and early iron workings were encouraged also. However, before the era of a proper road network, the canal had a virtual monopoly of transport, and it set its prices accordingly; so successful was its exploitation of the situation that it [...] "for many years yielded a dividend of Cent. per cent ... arising solely on <b>its</b> <b>tolls</b> on coal".|$|R
2500|$|The early {{coalmining}} {{activity was}} on the Faskine and Palacecraig estates, which were on the eastern extension. In 1820 the city of Glasgow was consuming [...] "half a million tons of coal a year, {{almost all of it}} subject to the high tolls on the Monkland Canal". In 1828 a rival company claimed that The Monkland Canal had [...] "for many years yielded a dividend of Cent. per Cent ... arising solely on <b>its</b> <b>Tolls</b> on coal".|$|R
5|$|Playing a {{physical}} style again took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Roberts' upper body, and he required surgery on both shoulders following the season. As a result, {{he missed the}} first {{four and a half}} months of the 2002–03 season; he appeared in only 14 games for Toronto. The Maple Leafs signed him to a one-year contract extension shortly after he returned from the injury. Roberts reached a career milestone midway through the 2003–04 season, as he played his 1,000th NHL game on January 13, 2004, a 4–1 victory over the Calgary Flames. He finished the season with 48 points in 72 games and played in his third All-Star Game.|$|E
5|$|The {{band had}} also {{incurred}} heavy legal {{expenses for the}} Penis Envy prosecution; this, combined with exhaustion and the pressures of living and operating together, finally took <b>its</b> <b>toll.</b> On 7 July 1984, the band played a benefit gig at Aberdare, Wales, for striking miners, and on the return trip guitarist N. A. Palmer announced {{that he intended to}} leave the group. This confirmed Crass's previous intention to quit in 1984, and the band split up.|$|E
5|$|The {{effort of}} the High Court {{challenge}} and the Olympic ban took <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Chambers, {{but he had no}} intention to retire and set an appearance in the 2012 London Olympics as his main goal, aiming to prove he could perform without the use of drugs. Lord Moynihan objected to this, saying it would sully the reputation of both the Great Britain athletics team and the London Olympics. In late 2008 Chambers signed a book deal, covering his athletics career and drug usage, and stated his desire to become a sprint coach when his track career was finished. He had his second child, a boy named Rocco, that November.|$|E

50|$|In {{the late}} nineteenth century, the Tyne Improvement Commission {{arranged}} for dredging and other works to improve the navigability of the River Tyne. For Newburn, it made the town not only easier to reach by boat, but necessitated {{the building of a}} river crossing, and so in 1893 Newburn Bridge was built. It was originally operated as a toll bridge, but was only freed of <b>its</b> <b>tolls</b> on 2 September 1947, making it the last bridge on the Tyne to do so.|$|R

5|$|The {{pressure}} of the separation and constant press attention began to take <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> of Carey. Growing creative differences with producer Walter Afanasieff ended their working relationship, after collaborating on most of Carey's previous output. The breaking point came after a heated argument during a long recording session, over the album's musical direction. Carey also faced media criticism over her choice of producers and several newspapers linked Carey romantically to several rappers, suggesting these relationships influenced her decisions. However, Carey denied the allegations, stating she had only slept with her husband.|$|E
5|$|When {{the region}} of Biafra broke away from Nigeria in 1967, Achebe became a {{supporter}} of Biafran independence and acted as ambassador {{for the people of}} the new nation. The war ravaged the populace, and as starvation and violence took <b>its</b> <b>toll,</b> he appealed to the people of Europe and the Americas for aid. When the Nigerian government retook the region in 1970, he involved himself in political parties but soon resigned due to frustration over the corruption and elitism he witnessed. He lived in the United States for several years in the 1970s, and returned to the U.S. in 1990, after a car accident left him partially disabled.|$|E
5|$|World War II meant The Football League was {{suspended}} for seven years, but Arsenal returned to win it in the second post-war season, 1947–48. This was Tom Whittaker's first season as manager, after his promotion to succeed Allison, and the club had equalled the champions of England record. They won a third FA Cup in 1950, and then won a record-breaking seventh championship in 1952–53. However, the war had taken <b>its</b> <b>toll</b> on Arsenal. The club had had more players killed than any top flight club, and debt from reconstructing the North Bank Stand bled Arsenal's resources.|$|E
50|$|Tardif also {{announced}} in August 1985 that Quebec was ending <b>its</b> freeway <b>tolls,</b> after twenty-one years of {{paying off the}} original cost of Montreal's four-lane highways.|$|R
50|$|This {{trail was}} built in {{the last decade of the}} 19th century by horsetheives, but was {{improved}} by different prospectors of that era. The Atchison, Topeka and Santa Fe Railway improved the trail further around 1910 to compete with the Camerons' Bright Angel Trail which charged a toll at the time. The railroad operated Hermit Camp about 7 trail miles below the rim until the 1930s when the National Park Service took over control of the Bright Angel Trail and officially rescinded <b>its</b> <b>tolls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Among other {{initiatives}} {{the group}} has pursued was {{the purchase of the}} Douglas Street Bridge (the first road bridge across the Missouri River) in hopes of taking <b>its</b> <b>tolls</b> off (the bridge was renamed the Ak-Sar-Ben Bridge). From the 1920s through the 1990s, the Knights built and operated a horse racing track and arena complex, also named Ak-Sar-Ben. In 1992 the Knights donated the horse racing track and arena complex to a new legal entity [...] - [...] the Ak-Sar-Ben Future Trust. This organization is developing the property for multi-purpose under the name Aksarben Village,.|$|R
