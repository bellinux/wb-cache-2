40|$|Abstract. To {{calibrate}} the helium mass-spectrometer <b>leak</b> <b>detector</b> in-site in {{the whole}} range, a series of leaks with helium-permeable membranes of different leakage rates were connected to a helium mass-spectrometer <b>leak</b> <b>detector</b> separately, then a set of readings of standard leaks were gained, and the relation curves were fitted mathematically between the standard leakage rates and leakage readings so as to give a fitting formula between the whole-range readings and leakage rates. As a result, the simplicity and efficiency method make it suitable for calibrations of helium mass-spectrometer <b>leak</b> <b>detector...</b>|$|R

40|$|The DIII-D National Fusion Facility at General Atomics {{focuses on}} plasma physics and fusion energy science. The DIII-D tokamak is a 35 m{sup 3 } {{toroidal}} vacuum vessel with over 200 ports for diagnostic instrumentation, cryogenics, microwave heating, and four large neutral beam injectors. Maintaining vacuum in the 10 {sup {minus} 8 } Torr range {{is crucial for}} producing high performance plasma discharges. He leak checking the DIII-D tokamak and the neutral beamlines has historically been difficult. D{sub 2 } is used as the fuel gas in most plasma discharges and neutral beams. After plasma operations, D{sub 2 } out-gassing from the torus walls and internal beamline components can exceed 10 {sup {minus} 4 } std cc/s. The mass of the D{sub 2 } molecule (4. 028 u) is indistinguishable {{from that of the}} He atom (4. 003 u) to a standard mass spectrometer <b>leak</b> <b>detector.</b> High levels of D{sub 2 } reduce <b>leak</b> <b>detector</b> sensitivity and effectively mask the He trace gas signal rendering normal leak checking techniques ineffective.

40|$|Description of an {{acceptable}} method for precision helium leak-rate measurement, for rather large pressurized vessels. Precise leakage rates of gaseous helium were measured by adapting a nominal helium <b>leak</b> <b>detector</b> {{in such a}} way that the gas load of the vacuum system plus the test vessel could be handled by the augmented pumping equipment while still being traced through the incorporated mass spectrometer. The vacuum chamber used for this experiment was maintained in 100 ntorr pressure range with a foreline pressure of 4 microns. Although sensitivity of the <b>leak</b> <b>detector</b> was diminished by reason of the larger pumping system, this did not affect the overall result in the capture and measurement of a complete leakage rate...|$|R
50|$|Ultrasonic gas {{detectors}} use acoustic {{sensors to}} detect {{changes in the}} background noise of its environment. Since most high-pressure gas leaks generate sound in the ultrasonic range of 25 kHz to 10 MHz, the sensors are able to easily distinguish these frequencies from background acoustic noise which occurs in the audible range of 20 Hz to 20 kHz. The ultrasonic gas <b>leak</b> <b>detector</b> then produces an alarm {{when there is an}} ultrasonic deviation from the normal condition of background noise. Ultrasonic gas <b>leak</b> <b>detectors</b> cannot measure gas concentration, but the device is able to determine the leak rate of an escaping gas because the ultrasonic sound level depends on the gas pressure and size of the leak.|$|R
40|$|High Technology Systems (HTS) with {{sensitive}} surfaces, such as superconducting {{radio frequency}} (SRF) accelerating cavities, polarized electron sources (PES) for accelerators and many others, {{are prone to}} degradation when subjected to particulate or hydrocarbon contaminants. Particulate contamination control of SRF cavity surfaces and vacuum components have been discussed by several authors at this contamination workshop. Hydrocarbon contamination mainly results from prolonged evacuation with conventional oil lubricated pumping systems and/or prolonged leak detection with conventional <b>leak</b> <b>detectors.</b> The sensitivity of the conventional <b>leak</b> <b>detectors</b> suffers due to the back-streaming of atmospheric helium (5 x 10 {sup {minus} 1 } Pa) through the pumping systems and/or the trapping of helium in the O-rings and oils of the pumping systems. This reduced sensitivity leads {{to the use of}} the <b>leak</b> <b>detectors</b> over long periods of time for detecting small (1 x 10 {sup {minus} 10 } atm. cc s{sup {minus} 1 }) leaks in HTS thereby exposing the sensitive surfaces to contamination.
