50|$|As a {{quantitative}} example, suppose a collector has 1000 postage stamps, of which 300 are pretty and 100 <b>are</b> <b>rare,</b> with 30 being both pretty and rare. 10% {{of all his}} stamps <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> and 10% of his pretty stamps <b>are</b> <b>rare,</b> so prettiness tells nothing about rarity. He puts the 370 stamps which <b>are</b> pretty or <b>rare</b> on display. Just over 27% of the stamps on display <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> (100/370), but still only 10% of the pretty stamps <b>are</b> <b>rare</b> (and 100% of the 70 not-pretty stamps on display <b>are</b> <b>rare).</b> If an observer only considers stamps on display, she will observe a spurious negative relationship between prettiness and rarity {{as a result of}} the selection bias (that is, not-prettiness strongly indicates rarity in the display, but not in the total collection).|$|R

5|$|Although {{it is an}} attractive-looking bolete, Caloboletus calopus is not {{considered}} edible on account of its very bitter taste, which does not disappear upon cooking. There are reports of it being eaten in far eastern Russia and Ukraine. The bitter taste {{is largely due to}} the compounds calopin and a δ-lactone derivative, O-acetylcyclocalopinA. These compounds contains a structural motif known as a 3-methylcatechol unit, which <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> in natural products. A total synthesis of calopin was reported in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Although it <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> on Earth, helium is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} element in the known Universe (after hydrogen), constituting 23% of its baryonic mass. The vast majority of helium was formed by Big Bang nucleosynthesis one to three minutes after the Big Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton-proton chain reactions and the CNO cycle, part of stellar nucleosynthesis.|$|E
