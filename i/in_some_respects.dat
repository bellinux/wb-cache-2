5|$|Dualism {{is a set}} {{of views}} about the {{relationship}} between mind and matter (or body). It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are, <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects,</b> non-physical. One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body dualism was expressed in the eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into purusha (mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance). Specifically, the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach {{to the nature of the}} mind.|$|E

5|$|Gene {{expression}} in prokaryotes {{is influenced by}} an RNA-based system similar <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects</b> to RNAi. Here, RNA-encoding genes control mRNA abundance or translation by producing a complementary RNA that anneals to an mRNA.

It has been suggested that CRISPR interference systems in prokaryotes are analogous to eukaryotic RNA interference systems, although none of the protein components are orthologous.|$|E

5|$|A {{cluster is}} a group of loosely coupled {{computers}} that work together closely, so that <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects</b> they can be regarded as a single computer. Clusters are composed of multiple standalone machines connected by a network. While machines in a cluster {{do not have to be}} symmetric, load balancing is more difficult if they are not. The most common type of cluster is the Beowulf cluster, which is a cluster implemented on multiple identical commercial off-the-shelf computers connected with a TCP/IP Ethernet local area network. Beowulf technology was originally developed by Thomas Sterling and Donald Becker. The vast majority of the TOP500 supercomputers are clusters.|$|E

5|$|Atman is the {{predominantly}} discussed {{topic in the}} Upanishads, but they express two distinct, somewhat divergent themes. Some state that Brahman (Highest Reality, Universal Principle, Being-Consciousness-Bliss) is identical with Atman, while others state Atman is part of Brahman but not identical. This ancient debate flowered into various dual, non-dual theories in Hinduism. The Brahmasutra by Badarayana (~ 100 BCE) synthesized and unified these somewhat conflicting theories, stating that Atman and Brahman are different <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects</b> particularly during the state of ignorance, but at the deepest level and {{in the state of}} self-realization, Atman and Brahman are identical, non-different.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} indicates the Enhydra lineage became {{isolated in the}} North Pacific approximately 2 Mya, giving rise to the now-extinct Enhydra macrodonta and the modern sea otter, Enhydra lutris. The sea otter evolved initially in northern Hokkaidō and Russia, and then spread east to the Aleutian Islands, mainland Alaska, and down the North American coast. In comparison to cetaceans, sirenians, and pinnipeds, which entered the water approximately 50, 40, and 20 Mya, respectively, the sea otter is a relative newcomer to a marine existence. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects,</b> though, the sea otter is more fully adapted to water than pinnipeds, which must haul out on land or ice to give birth.|$|E

The two manuscripts differ from each other <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects,</b> and the spelling is very poor. William J. Watson notes that the text of MS.

5|$|Zinc is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Zn and atomic number 30. It {{is the first}} element in group 12 of the periodic table. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects</b> zinc is chemically similar to magnesium: both elements exhibit only one normal oxidation state (+2), and the Zn2+ and Mg2+ ions are of similar size. Zinc is the 24th most abundant element in Earth's crust and has five stable isotopes. The most common zinc ore is sphalerite (zinc blende), a zinc sulfide mineral. The largest workable lodes are in Australia, Asia, and the United States. Zinc is refined by froth flotation of the ore, roasting, and final extraction using electricity (electrowinning).|$|E
5|$|In {{physical}} systems, Noether's theorem {{provides an}} equivalence between conservation laws and symmetries of the system. However, for cellular automata this theorem {{does not directly}} apply, because instead of being governed by {{the energy of the}} system the behavior of the automaton is encoded into its rules, and the automaton is guaranteed to obey certain symmetries (translation invariance in both space and time) regardless of any conservation laws it might obey. Nevertheless, the conserved quantities of certain reversible systems behave similarly to energy <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects.</b> For instance, if different regions of the automaton have different average values of some conserved quantity, the automaton's rules may cause this quantity to dissipate, so that the distribution of the quantity is more uniform in later states. Using these conserved quantities as a stand-in for the energy of the system can allow it to be analyzed using methods from classical physics.|$|E

5|$|Simović named Maček as Deputy Prime Minister {{once again}} in the new government, but Maček was {{reluctant}} and remained in Zagreb while he decided what to do. While he considered the coup had been an entirely Serbian initiative aimed at both Prince Paul and the Cvetković–Maček Agreement, he decided that he needed to show HSS support for the new government and that joining it was necessary. On 4 April he travelled to Belgrade and accepted the post, on several conditions; that the new government respect the Cvetković–Maček Agreement and expand the autonomy of the Banovina Croatia <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects,</b> that the new government respect the country's accession to the Tripartite Pact, and that one Serb and one Croat temporarily assume the role of regents.

5|$|The {{game was}} the first title in the Fire Emblem series on a {{portable}} console. While development of a handheld Fire Emblem title had been considered for earlier games, the team felt available hardware lacked the expression to realize their vision. The GBA offered technical capacities superior to the Super Famicom, the release platform of the last Fire Emblem title , while also offering portability, making it more appealing to players. The platform was also chosen due to estimated development time and budget considerations. Developing for the new hardware proved challenging <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects,</b> and easy in others such as creating basic software. During development, two different versions were developed while the team were {{getting used to the}} new hardware. One of the main issues they faced was the limited resolution and screen size of the GBA. The game's combat animations were intended to evoke scenes from high fantasy, such as The Lord of the Rings, contrasting with the equivalent styles of fantasy fighting in Japanese stories.|$|E
5|$|There {{has long}} been debate about whether the qualities of mind, personality, and {{intelligence}} {{can be attributed to}} heredity or to upbringing—this is the nature and nurture controversy. Although many details remain to be settled, neuroscience research has clearly shown that both factors are important. Genes determine the general form of the brain, and genes determine how the brain reacts to experience. Experience, however, is required to refine the matrix of synaptic connections, which in its developed form contains far more information than the genome does. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects,</b> all that matters is {{the presence or absence of}} experience during critical periods of development. In other respects, the quantity and quality of experience are important; for example, there is substantial evidence that animals raised in enriched environments have thicker cerebral cortices, indicating a higher density of synaptic connections, than animals whose levels of stimulation are restricted.|$|E

5|$|Though the plumage of {{the spotted}} green pigeon {{resembles that of}} the Nicobar pigeon <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects,</b> it is also {{similar to that of}} species in the {{imperial}} pigeon genus Ducula. The metallic-green colouration is commonly found among them, and similar hackles {{can be seen in the}} goliath imperial pigeon (D. goliath). The Polynesian imperial pigeon (D. aurorae) has similar soft feathers, and immature individuals of this species and the Pacific imperial pigeon (D. pacifica) have plumage different from that of juvenile and adult birds until they moult. Therefore, vanGrouw found it possible that the dull, brownish-black underparts of the surviving spotted green pigeon specimen represents the plumage of an immature bird, as the adults of similar birds have stronger and more glossy iridescence. He suggested that the brighter bird with paler underparts and whiter wing tips seen in Latham's illustration may represent the adult plumage.|$|E
5|$|At {{this time}} the Luftwaffe was sending {{increased}} numbers of Focke-Wulf Fw 190 fighters over England, at night and at low-level. They were able to hit the coastal areas and their speed and agility meant they were a difficult prospect to intercept. The German pilots were disadvantaged <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects.</b> There {{was a lack of}} nigh-flying experience in these units, the Fw 190s did not carry radar and had a short range. Aside from a small mirror, the pilot could not always see behind him well enough at night. On 16 May 1943 the Fw 190s lost four and probably a fifth to 85 Squadron. On 13 June 1943 Cunningham intercepted an Fw 190 not far from his airfield at West Malling. The GCI controller telephoned the crew-room to notify them the commanding officer was closing on an enemy aircraft heading to London. They heard both aircraft and the brief burst of fire followed by the explosion. To his amazement, Cunningham later learned the pilot—Leutnant Ullrich from 3./Schnellkampfgeschwader 10 (Fast Bomber Wing 10—SKG 10)—was thrown through the canopy as the Fw 190A-5, Werknummer, 840047 code CO+LT, fell earthwards. He deployed his parachute and was picked up by a searchlight crew with a broken arm.|$|E
5|$|The Commission {{differs from}} the other {{institutions}} in that it alone has legislative initiative in the EU. Only the Commission can make formal proposals for legislation: they cannot originate in the legislative branches. Under the Treaty of Lisbon, no legislative act is allowed {{in the field of}} the Common Foreign and Security Policy. In the other fields the Council and Parliament are able to request legislation; in most cases the Commission initiates the basis of these proposals. This monopoly is designed to ensure coordinated and coherent drafting of EU law. This monopoly has been challenged by some who claim the Parliament should also have the right, with most national parliaments holding the right <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>respects.</b> However, the Council and Parliament may request the Commission to draft legislation, though the Commission does have the power to refuse to do so as it did in 2008 over transnational collective conventions.
