5|$|<b>Early</b> <b>treatment</b> {{increases}} {{the chance of}} a good outcome. Treatment consists of stabilizing the person, followed by the use of an antidote. The preferred antidote is fomepizole with ethanol used if this is not available. Hemodialysis may also be used in those where there is organ damage or a high degree of acidosis. Other treatments may include sodium bicarbonate, thiamine, and magnesium.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{may include}} {{activated}} charcoal {{if the person}} presents soon after the overdose. Attempting to force the person to vomit is not recommended. If {{there is a potential}} for toxicity, the antidote acetylcysteine is recommended. The medication is generally given for at least 24 hours. Psychiatric care may be required following recovery. A liver transplant may be required if damage to the liver becomes severe. The need for transplant is often based on low blood pH, high blood lactate, poor blood clotting, or significant hepatic encephalopathy. With <b>early</b> <b>treatment</b> liver failure is rare. Death occurs in about 0.1% of cases.|$|E

40|$|Introduction Several {{studies have}} {{indicated}} that <b>early</b> identification and <b>treatment</b> of patients with severe sepsis using standard supportive care improves outcomes. <b>Earlier</b> <b>treatment</b> with drotrecogin alfa (activated) (DrotAA) may also improve outcomes in severe sepsis. Using a recently constructed integrated severe sepsis database, our objectives in this study were to describe the influence of baseline clinical characteristics on timing of DrotAA treatment in patients with severe sepsis, to evaluate the efficacy of DrotAA with respect to timing of administration, and to examine the association between early intervention with DrotAA and patient outcomes, using adjustments for imbalances. Methods The database comprises data from 4, 459 patients with severe sepsis (DrotAA, n = 3, 228; placebo, n = 1, 231) included in five clinical trials conducted in tertiary care institutions in 28 countries. Placebo data came only from randomized trials, whereas data for the DrotAA group came from randomized (PROWESS) and open-label/observational (ENHANCE) trials. Results Increased time-to-treatment with DrotAA was significantly associated with more organ dysfunction, greater need of mechanical ventilation, vasopressor use, or recent surgery. <b>Earlier</b> <b>treatment</b> was associated with higher baseline Acute Physiology and Chronic Health Evaluation (APACHE II) scores. Adjusted and unadjusted survival analyses suggested that compared with placebo, DrotAA treatment provided a potential survival benefit, regardless of time to treatment. Survival curves of DrotAA patients treated early compared with those treated late began to separate at 14 days. By 28 days, patients treated earlier had higher survival than those treated later (76. 4 % versus 73. 5 %, p = 0. 03). Sepsis-induced multiorgan dysfunction was {{the most common cause of}} death followed by refractory shock and respiratory failure. Modeling of the treatment effect, as a function of time to treatment, suggested increased benefit with <b>earlier</b> <b>treatment.</b> Conclusion Using an integrated database of five severe sepsis trials and appropriate statistical adjustments to reduce sources of potential bias, <b>earlier</b> <b>treatment</b> with DrotAA seemed to be associated with a lower risk-adjusted mortality than later treatment. These data suggest that <b>earlier</b> <b>treatment</b> with DrotAA may provide most benefit for appropriate patients...|$|R
