According to The Daily Telegraph, before her marriage, Susan was [...] "a beauty queen turned lingerie model" [...] who [...] "launched a fashion business". The couple met in Spain, where Susan had a bridal wear company, when Gunn was there on holiday. She told the Telegraph, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> Bryan, I knew nothing about football and {{had no idea who}} he was because {{he told me he was}} a joiner." ...|$|E
500|$|The film's soundtrack {{and score}} were {{composed}} by Ilaiyaraaja, this being his 100th film. It {{was also the}} first film in which he collaborated with Mahendra; Ilaiyaraaja would later compose for all of Mahendra's films until Thalaimuraigal (2013), the director's last film before his death in February 2014. Mahendra recalled in 2007, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> [...] I explained him what my kind of movie is and what I expect from him. The background score should allow meaningful silences in my films. I believe silence conveys more than words or music".|$|E
500|$|Paul Kelly's first {{marriage}} (1980–84) was to Hilary Brown; {{the couple had}} a son, Declan, who later worked as a radio presenter on 3RRR's Against the Arctic from 2006. As of 2007, he was a DJ around Melbourne and played the drums. For Paul Kelly: Stories of Me Declan recalled his feelings whenever he hears [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>First</b> <b>Met</b> Your Ma", which describes Kelly's courtship of Hilary. Hilary remembered [...] "songs written especially for and about her" [...] but also about other women, she quipped [...] "here are too many girls out there! One for every song!" ...|$|E

60|$|It {{was over}} this matter of {{pictures}} that <b>I</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met</b> her, {{for her father}} owned a palace on the farther side of the Rialto Bridge upon the Grand Canal, {{and it was so}} packed with wall-paintings that Suchet sent a party of sappers to cut some of them out and send them to Paris.|$|R
500|$|Kelly {{had already}} {{established}} himself as a respected songwriter—other Melbourne musicians would go to see him on their nights off. Richard Guilliatt, writing for The Monthly, later described Kelly from a 1979 performance at Richmond's Kingston Hotel, the singer was [...] "a skinny guy with a head of black curls framing a pale face and a bent nose... singing with his eyes closed, one arm outstretched and the other resting on the body of the Fender Telecaster". Kelly was introduced to Hilary Brown at one of the Dots' gigs and they later married – the relationship is described in [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>First</b> <b>Met</b> Your Ma" [...] (1992). Brown's father supplied Kelly with a gravy recipe – used on [...] "How to Make Gravy" [...] (1996). Their son, Declan, was born in 1980.|$|E
500|$|The {{authors of}} the book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, called it [...] "impressive" [...] how [...] "even after Nelson has beaten [...] up for {{apparently}} making a pass, [...] will still do anything for uncaring Lisa." [...] Josh Weinstein called {{it one of the}} most [...] "real" [...] episodes, commenting that every character in the episode, from Superintendent Chalmers to Lisa, acts like a real person throughout. The medic's line [...] "He can't hear you, we had to pack his ears with gauze" [...] is one of Matt Groening's favorites. Marge's line [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> your father, he was loud, crude and piggish. But I worked hard on him, and now he's a whole new person", is one of Susie Dietter's favorites, as it explains why Marge is still married to Homer despite his actions.|$|E
500|$|Olivia died of {{complications}} {{brought on by}} gall bladder disease on 3October1938. The day before her death she {{wrote in a letter}} to Dorothy: [...] "On Monday I was taken suddenly ill with gall bladder trouble—awful pain—sent for Doctor Barnes—he gave me dope & an injection and pain gradually went... He says I am going on all right, but of course I feel rather a wreck". She died the following day of a heart attack. John Unterecker believes Olivia's death shattered Yeats, who died only months later, because she added warmth to his life. Yeats wrote of her death:Olivia Shakespear has died suddenly. For more than forty years she has been the centre of my life in London and during all that time we have never had a quarrel, sadness sometimes but never a difference. When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> her she was in her late twenties but in looks a lovely young girl. When she died she was a lovely old woman... She came of a long line of soldiers and during the last war thought it her duty to stay in London through all the air raids. She was not more lovely than distinguished—no matter what happened she never lost her solitude... For the moment I cannot bear the thought of London. I will find her memory everywhere.|$|E

"It was <b>I</b> who <b>first</b> <b>met</b> you, Squire," [...] the old {{man went}} on, [...] "when you tottered home that night across the park, with your arm hanging helplessly by your side, and the blood {{streaming}} down your face and clothes, and the red light in your eyes--murderous fire, they called it. I heard her ladyship go into hysterics. I saw her laugh and sob like a maniac, and, God help us! that's what she's been ever since." ...|$|R
2500|$|Sometime in 1924, when Shuster was 9 or 10, {{his family}} moved to Cleveland, Ohio. There Shuster {{attended}} Glenville High School and befriended his later collaborator, writer Jerry Siegel, with whom he began publishing a science fiction fanzine called Science Fiction. Siegel described his friendship with the similarly shy and bespectacled Shuster: [...] "When Joe and <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> it was like the right chemicals coming together." ...|$|E
2500|$|The gravy {{recipe is}} genuine – Kelly learnt {{it from his}} father-in-law: [...] "Just add flour, salt, a little red wine and don't forget a dollop of tomato sauce". In the late 1970s, Kelly met his future wife, Hilary Brown, {{at one of his}} early gigs – the {{relationship}} is described in the 1992 song, [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>First</b> <b>Met</b> Your Ma", written for their son, Declan (born 1980). In 1984 Brown and Kelly divorced.|$|E
2500|$|Siegel {{attended}} Glenville High School in Cleveland, Ohio {{and worked}} for its weekly student newspaper, The Torch. He was a shy, not particularly popular student, but became known among his peers for his Tarzan parody, [...] "Goober the Mighty." [...] At about age 16, while at Glenville, he befriended his later collaborator, Joe Shuster. Siegel described his friendship with the similarly shy and bespectacled Shuster: [...] "When Joe and <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met,</b> {{it was like the}} right chemicals coming together." ...|$|E

6000|$|I {{passed a}} quiet and (all things considered) a happy time among the old scenes.

How sadly and strangely had our lives been parted since that time! How uncertain still was the fortune which the future had in store for us! ...|$|R

2500|$|Her {{future husband}} Allan McKeown had {{reservations}} about her launching a music career and tried talking {{her out of}} it. “When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> Miss Ullman, I was a TV producer, and I called her into my office in London and I {{told her that she}} had a big career in comedy, and she said to me, ‘Well actually, I’m doing a record next week,’ and I said, ‘Now listen here Miss Ullman, if I know anything about show business, is that you shouldn’t get involved with singing.

2500|$|It {{was there}} that <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> Gurdjieff {{in the autumn of}} 1920, and no {{surroundings}} could have been more appropriate. In Gurdjieff, East and West do not just meet. Their difference is annihilated in a world outlook which knows no distinctions of race or creed. This was my first, and has remained one of my strongest impressions. A Greek from the Caucasus, he spoke Turkish with an accent of unexpected purity, the accent that one associates with those born and bred in the narrow circle of the Imperial Court. His appearance was striking enough even in Turkey, where one saw many unusual types. His head was shaven, immense black moustache, eyes which at one moment seemed very pale and at another almost black. Below average height, he gave nevertheless an impression of great physical strength ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{moving to}} San Diego {{in the summer}} of 1992, Hoppus was reunited with his sister Anne Hoppus, to whom he {{expressed}} his desire to be in a band. Anne attended Rancho Bernardo High School, and had become friends with new student Tom DeLonge over the summer. In August 1992, Anne introduced the two, and Hoppus and DeLonge immediately began performing music in DeLonge's garage. To impress DeLonge, Hoppus {{climbed to the top of}} a streetlight outside of DeLonge's home – however, he broke both ankles on the way down, resulting in being in crutches for the next few weeks. DeLonge recalled the meeting in 2000: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> Mark, we were running around naked, doing weird stuff. We were up skateboarding until late hours of the morning, antagonizing security guards, and we were just always having fun." [...] DeLonge recruited old friend Scott Raynor from his days at Poway to become the drummer for the new band, named Blink.|$|E

6000|$|Mrs. Staveley {{began by}} {{complaining}} to {{him of the}} conduct of his son. I had promised to write to her, and I had never kept my word. She had reasons for being especially interested in my plans and prospects, just then; knowing me to be attached (please take notice that I am quoting her own language) to a charming friend of hers, whom <b>I</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met</b> at her house. To aggravate the disappointment that I had inflicted, the young lady had neglected her, too. No letters, no information. Perhaps my father would kindly enlighten her? Was the affair going on? or was it broken off? ...|$|R
50|$|Charles Stanley Nott (1887-1978) was an author, publisher, {{translator}} and {{a student}} of G. <b>I.</b> Gurdjieff. He <b>first</b> <b>met</b> Gurdjieff and A. R. Orage in New York in 1923. He spent time at the Institute for the Harmonious Development of Man and became a close student of Gurdjieff. He helped with the publication and distribution of Gurdjieff's first published book The Herald of Coming Good. He wrote two books on his life and experience with Gurdjieff, Orage, and P. D. Ouspensky.|$|R
2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> Temple in {{the mid-1980s}} [...] annual [...] conference. Standing on the {{periphery}} of the group was a tall young woman who was obviously interested in the discussions. She seemed shy and pleasant, but mostly she just listened. I learned her name was Temple Grandin. It wasn't until later in the week that I realized she was someone with autism. I approached her and asked if she'd be willing to speak at the next year's [...] conference. She agreed. The next year Temple first addressed an [...] audience. People were standing at least three deep. The audience couldn't get enough of her. Here, for the first time, was someone who could tell us from her own experience, what it was like to be extremely sound sensitive ("like being tied to the rail and the train's coming"). She was asked many questions: [...] "Why does my son do so much spinning?" [...] "Why does he hold his hands to his ears?" [...] "Why doesn't he look at me?" [...] She spoke from her own experience, and her insight was impressive. There were tears in more than one set of eyes that day. Temple quickly became a much sought-after speaker in the autism community.|$|E
2500|$|In a 2004 {{interview}} (published 9 December), Flew, then 81 years old, {{said that}} he had become a deist. In the article Flew states that he has renounced his long-standing espousal of atheism by endorsing a deism of the sort that Thomas Jefferson advocated ("While reason, mainly in the form of arguments to design, assures us that there is a God, there is no room either for any supernatural revelation of that God or for any transactions between that God and individual human beings"). [...] Flew stated that [...] "the most impressive arguments for God’s existence are those that are supported by recent scientific discoveries" [...] and that [...] "the argument to Intelligent Design is enormously stronger than it was when <b>I</b> <b>first</b> <b>met</b> it". The argument of ID is that evidenced objects and physical concepts are either too simple or too complex to be simply natural, which ever of the two extremes one chooses to be the hallmark of design by an outside intelligence. He also answered in the affirmative to Habermas's question, [...] "So of the major theistic arguments, such as the cosmological, teleological, moral, and ontological, the only really impressive ones that you take to be decisive are the scientific forms of teleology?". He supported the idea of an Aristotelian God with [...] "the characteristics of power and also intelligence", stating that the evidence for it was stronger than ever before. He rejected the idea of an afterlife, of God as the source of good (he explicitly states that God has created [...] "a lot of" [...] evil), and of the resurrection of Jesus as a historical fact, although he has allowed a short chapter arguing in favor of Joshua's/Jesus' resurrection to be added into his latest book.|$|E

60|$|My fortieth {{birthday}} {{found me}} practising at Cairo, which I mention {{only because it}} was here that <b>first</b> <b>I</b> <b>met</b> Ptolemy Higgs, who, even then in his youth, was noted for his extraordinary antiquarian and linguistic abilities.

6000|$|He {{wired to}} me from that same house in Mayfair in which <b>I</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met</b> Mary after my return. He {{asked me to come}} to him in the afternoon, and thither I went through a November fog, and found him in the drawing-room that had the plate glass above the fireplace. But now he was vacating the house, and {{everything}} was already covered up, the pictures and their frames were under holland, the fine furniture all in covers of faded stuff, the chandeliers and statues wrapped up, the carpets rolled out of the way. Even the window-curtains were tucked into wrappers, and the blinds, except one he had raised, drawn down. He greeted me and apologized for the cold inhospitality of the house. [...] "It was convenient here," [...] he said. [...] "I came here to clear out my papers and boxes. And there's no chance of interruptions." ...|$|R
60|$|Beyond {{this place}} (alt. 14,500 feet), the valley runs up north-east, {{becoming}} very stony and desolate, with green patches {{only by the}} watercourses: at this place, however, thick fogs came on, and obscured all view. At 15,000 feet, I passed a small glacier {{on the west side}} of the valley, the <b>first</b> <b>I</b> had <b>met</b> with that descended nearly to the river, during the whole course of the Teesta.|$|R
60|$|Not one impression, {{but many}} impressions, troubled and {{confused}} my mind. Certain passages in the confession inclined {{me to believe}} that the writer was mad. But I altered my opinion at the next leaf, and set him down as a man with a bitter humor, disposed to make merry over his own bad qualities. At one time, his tone in writing of his early life, and his allusions to his mother, won my sympathy and respect. At another time, the picture of himself in his later years, and the defiant manner in which he presented it, almost made me regret that he had not died of the illness which had struck him deaf. In this state of uncertainty I may claim the merit of having arrived, so far as my own future conduct was concerned, at one positive conclusion. As strangers he and <b>I</b> had <b>first</b> <b>met.</b> As strangers <b>I</b> was determined we should remain.|$|R
