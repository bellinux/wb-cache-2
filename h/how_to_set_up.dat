5|$|As {{part of this}} Popular Revolution, Gaddafi invited Libya's {{people to}} found General People's Committees as {{conduits}} for raising political consciousness. Although offering little guidance for <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> these councils, Gaddafi claimed that they would offer a form of direct political participation that was more democratic than a traditional party-based representative system. He hoped that the councils would mobilise the people behind the RCC, erode {{the power of the}} traditional leaders and the bureaucracy, and allow for a new legal system chosen by the people. Many such committees were established in schools and colleges, where they were responsible for vetting staff, courses, and textbooks to determine if they were compatible with the country's revolutionary ideology.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, AVEN members {{participated in}} the first asexual entry into an American pride parade when they walked in the San Francisco Pride Parade. In August 2010, {{after a period of}} debate over having an asexual flag and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> a system to create one, and {{contacting}} as many asexual communities as possible, a flag was announced as the asexual pride flag by one of the teams involved. The final flag had been a popular candidate and had previously seen use in online forums outside of AVEN. The final vote was held on a survey system outside of AVEN where the main flag creation efforts were organized. The flag colors have been used in artwork and referenced in articles about the sexuality.|$|E
5|$|The Cubs' closer for 1981, Dick Tidrow, had a 3–10 {{season with}} a 5.06 ERA, and as a result, in 1982 Smith, Willie Hernández and Bill Campbell shared closing duties. Smith pitched well and even started five games from mid-June to early July. Significantly, former Cubs star pitcher Ferguson Jenkins {{returned}} to the team in 1982, and became {{a major influence on}} the young reliever; Smith credited Jenkins with simplifying his delivery, introducing him to the slider and forkball, and teaching him <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> hitters. In what would be the last start of his career, Smith picked up his first major league hit, a home run off eventual Hall of Famer Phil Niekro. Smith managed only two singles {{for the rest of his}} career. He saved 17 games during that season and performed as the regular closer for the Cubs, a position he held for the next five years.|$|E

25|$|Under {{the current}} Laws, a captain may forfeit either of his side's innings. A {{forfeited}} innings shall {{be considered as}} a completed innings. Usually this happens in shorter competitive two-innings matches, where captains need to agree with each other <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> the match so that there is a reasonable chance of a result.

25|$|On August 10, Kintetsu and Orix {{advanced}} merger plans by officially signing {{an agreement}} that outlined the basic details of the planned team merger, including that the new merged club would be run by a new company jointly owned by the parent companies of the two teams, 80% by Orix and the rest by Kintetsu. The next day, approximately 300fans protested the merger by marching with signs and chantings slogans in Tokyo's Hibiya district. Days later, JPBPA members voted overwhelmingly {{for the right to}} strike as part of a bid to maintain the two-league system and prevent team mergers. Of about 750members of the players’ union, 98% voted in favor of strike rights. Fewer than ten members opposed striking.

In this project, Grameenphone provides GSM/EDGE/GPRS infrastructure and technical support and other partners Grameen Telecom Corporation and Society for Economic and Basic Advancement (SEBA), are involved in selecting and training entrepreneurs to run the village centres. The computers in these centres in the pilot project are used by an average of 30 people a day, who pay a small fee to access email or web pages.

25|$|The UN {{held the}} third global women's conference in Nairobi. During the conference, Maathai {{arranged}} {{seminars and presentations}} to describe the work the Green Belt Movement was doing in Kenya. She escorted delegates to see nurseries and plant trees. She met Peggy Snyder, the head of UNIFEM, and Helvi Sipilä, the first woman appointed a UN assistant secretary general. The conference helped to expand funding for the Green Belt Movement {{and led to the}} movement's establishing itself outside Kenya. In 1986, with funding from UNEP, the movement expanded throughout Africa and led to the foundation of the Pan-African Green Belt Network. Forty-five representatives from fifteen African countries travelled to Kenya {{over the next three years}} to learn <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> similar programs in their own countries to combat desertification, deforestation, water crises, and rural hunger. The attention the movement received in the media led to Maathai's being honored with numerous awards. The government of Kenya, however, demanded that the Green Belt Movement separate from the NCWK, believing the latter should focus solely on women's issues, not the environment. Therefore, in 1987, Maathai stepped down as chairman of the NCWK and focused on the newly separate non-governmental organization.|$|E

500|$|The game {{developers}} realized early during {{development that}} the game could not be completed entirely in-house due to the large scope of the project, and required working with Hollywood agencies, actors and special effects houses, among others. This added further complexity to the game's development and design. Gerald B. Wolfe, the game's director of photography, spoke to the artists about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> the camera angles during filming to best accommodate {{the design of the}} rooms. Mannequins created in the computer substituted as stand-ins for the actors to help Wolfe position the shots. Most of the artists had never created computer-generated backgrounds for video-captured characters, and found it to be a challenging process. Seibert said bridging the gap between Hollywood and the software world was difficult at first, but after about four weeks of shooting, the two sides had [...] "come to a common language and had a greater understanding of the process". Hoyos said the biggest difficulty in designing the look of the game was creating a definitive scale for the environment, and ensuring the objects and environment would eventually be compatible with human characters and maintain realism.|$|E

2500|$|Asymptotic {{flatness}} is an idealization, and a {{very useful}} one, both in our current [...] "Gold Standard" [...] theory of gravitation -- General Relativity—and in the simpler theory it [...] "overthrew", Newtonian gravitation. [...] One might expect that as a (so far mostly hypothetical) sequence of increasingly sophisticated theories of gravitation providing more and more accurate models of fundamental physics, these theories will become monotonically more [...] "powerful". [...] But this hope is probably naive: we should expect a monotonically increasing range of choices in making various theoretical tradeoffs, rather than monotonic [...] "improvement". [...] In particular, as our physical theories {{become more and more}} accurate, we should expect that it will become harder and harder to employ idealizations with the same ease with which we can invoke them in more forgiving (that is, less restrictive) theories. [...] This is because more accurate theories necessarily demand setting up more accurate boundary conditions, which can render it difficult to see <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>set</b> <b>up</b> some idealization familiar in a simpler theory in a more sophisticated theory. [...] Indeed, we must expect that some idealizations admitted by previous theories may not be admitted at all by succeeding theories.|$|E
