40|$|A general {{test was}} made in the N. A. C. A. tank of a 1 / 12 -size model of the hull of the British Singapore IIC flying boat loaned by the Director of Research, British Air Ministry. The results are given in charts and are {{compared}} with the results of tests of a model of an American flying-boat hull, the Sikorsky S- 40. The Singapore hull has a greater <b>hump</b> <b>resistance</b> but a much lower high-speed resistance than the S- 40...|$|E
40|$|The {{second part}} of a series of tests made in Langley tank no. 2 to {{determine}} the effect of varying design parameters of planing-tail hulls is presented. Results are given to show the effects on resistance characteristics of varying angle of afterbody keel, depth of step, and length of afterbody chine. The effect of varying the gross load is shown for one configuration. The resistance characteristics of planing-tail hulls are compared with those of a conventional flying-boat hull. The forces on the forebody and afterbody of one configuration are compared with the forces on a conventional hull. Increasing the angle of afterbody keel had small effect on <b>hump</b> <b>resistance</b> and no effect on high-speed resistance but increased free-to-trim resistance at intermediate speeds. Increasing the depth of step increased <b>hump</b> <b>resistance,</b> had little effect on high-speed resistance, and increased free-to-trim resistance at intermediate speeds. Omitting the chines on the forward 25 percent of the afterbody had no appreciable effect on resistance. Omitting 70 percent of the chine length had almost no effect on maximum resistance but broadened the hump and increased spray around the afterbody. Load-resistance ratio at the hump decreased more rapidly with increasing load coefficient for the planing-tail hull than for the representative conventional hull, although the load-resistance ratio at the hump was greater for the planing-tail hull than for the conventional hull throughout the range of loads tested. At speeds higher than hump speed, load-resistance ratio for the planing-tail hull was a maximum at a particular gross load and was slightly less at heavier and lighter gross loads. The planing-tail hull was found to have lower resistance than the conventional hull at both the hump and at high speeds, but at intermediate speeds there was little difference. The lower <b>hump</b> <b>resistance</b> of the planing-tail hull was attributed to the ability of the afterbody to carry a greater percentage of the total load while maintaining a higher value of load-resistance ratio...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} towing tests made on two models {{at the request}} of the Bureau of Aeronautics, Navy Department, are presented. The first model {{represents}} the hull of the U. S. Navy PN- 8 flying boat, in which the sponsors of the original hull are removed and auxiliary lifting vanes are fitted at the chines immediately forward of the main step. The tests showed that the altered form gave a large increase in <b>hump</b> <b>resistance</b> and a very undesirable spray formation through a large part of the speed range...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a safety-guaranteed trajectory tracking controller for hovercraft {{by using a}} safety-guaranteed auxiliary dynamic system, an integral sliding mode control, and an adaptive neural network method. The safety-guaranteed auxiliary dynamic system is designed to implement system state and input constraints. By considering the relationship of velocity and <b>resistance</b> <b>hump,</b> the velocity of hovercraft is constrained to eliminate the effect of <b>resistance</b> <b>hump</b> and obtain better stability. And the safety limit of drift angle is well performed to guarantee the light safe maneuvers of hovercraft tracking with high velocities. In view of the natural capabilities of actuators, the control input is constrained. High nonlinearity and model uncertainties of hovercraft are approximated by employing adaptive radical basis function neural networks. The proposed controller guarantees the boundedness of all the closed-loop signals. Specifically, the tracking errors are uniformly ultimately bounded. Numerical simulations are implemented to demonstrate {{the efficacy of the}} designed controller...|$|R
40|$|High-quality superconducting KxFeySe 2 single {{crystals}} were synthesized {{using an}} easy one-step method. Detailed annealing studies {{were performed to}} make clear the phase formation process in KxFeySe 2. Compatible observations were found in temperature-dependent X-ray diffraction patterns, back-scattered electron images and corresponding electromagnetic properties, which proved that good superconductivity performance was close related to the microstructure of superconducting component. Analysis based on the scaling behavior of flux pinning force indicated that the dominant pinning mechanism was delta(Tc) pinning and independent of connectivity. The annealing dynamics studies were also performed, which manifested that the <b>humps</b> in temperature-dependent <b>resistance</b> (RT) curves were induced by competition between the metallic/superconducting and the semiconducting/insulating phases...|$|R
30|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} virus associated lipodystrophy shares several morphological features {{and should be}} differentiated from Cushing Syndrome. Weight gain, central adiposity, dorsocervical <b>hump,</b> insulin <b>resistance,</b> osteopenia, dyslipidemia are common and are associated with ART therapy (Lichtenstein 2005; Dube et al. 2007; Carr and Cooper 1998). Presence of facial plethora, cutaneous striae, and proximal myopathy differentiates it from Cushing syndrome and should prompt physicians to evaluate for HPA axis suppression. Sudden withdrawal of from steroid therapy has a potential to develop catastrophic adrenal crisis. Replacement with physiological doses of prednisone 5 – 7.5  mg a day, hydrocortisone 15 – 20  mg a day or equivalent should be initiated. Measurement of morning cortisol levels every 4 – 6  weeks serves as screening test for recovery of adrenal function. Morning serum cortisol level less than 3  mcg/dL indicates the need for continued replacement therapy, whereas a value greater than 20  mcg/dL indicates recovered HPA axis. Patients with morning cortisol levels between 3 and 20  mcg/dL will need further studies like Cosyntropin stimulation test or overnight metyrapone test. It may take 9 – 12  months for the recovery of adrenal function (Hopkins and Leinung 2005).|$|R
40|$|Large {{models of}} the Mark V and Mark VI floats used for single float {{seaplanes}} (National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) models 41 -A and 41 -B, respectively) were tested in the NACA tank to provide general test data for typical single floats and a basis for possible improvements of their form. The resistance of model 41 -B was {{greater than that of}} model 41 -A, either when free to trim or at the best trim angle for each. The resistance of model 35 -B (a pointed step hull tested free to trim) was less than either of the models at the hump speed, greater at intermediate planing speeds, and less at the speeds and loads near get-away, although the spray was generally worse owing to the absence of transverse flare. The results of the fixed-trim tests of model 41 -A were cross plotted to obtain data at the angle for zero trimming moment and at the best trim angle. The trims assumed by models 41 -A and 41 -B, when tested free to trim, were found to be excessive at the hump speed. The corresponding trim of model 35 -B was found to be approximately 3 degrees lower because of the lower angle of afterbody keel used in this model, and the maximum <b>hump</b> <b>resistance</b> was 15 percent lower...|$|E
40|$|The {{discovery}} of superconductivity of about 30 K in iron selenides with very large magnetic moments simulates {{the examination of}} completing orders. Here we report a finding of pressure- induced suppression of the superconducting transition temperature Tc and enhancement of {{the temperature of the}} <b>resistance</b> <b>hump</b> TH through charge transfer between two iron sites with different occupancies. The activation energy for the electric transport of the high-temperature resistance is observed to go to zero at a critical pressure of 8. 7 GPa, at which superconductivity tends to disappear and the semiconductor-to-metal transition takes place. Beyond the critical point, the resistance exhibits a metallic behavior over the whole temperature range studied. All these features indicate the existence of quantum criticality in iron-selenide superconductors. Comment: 5 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} Towing-tank {{method for}} testing a seaplane {{was developed and}} implemented. The defined test programme represents a complete experimental task for study the hydrodynamic characteristics of the flying boat during take-off. A specific test-rig was designed by CNR-INSEAN {{in collaboration with the}} customer EDI, who took care of its development and implementation during the test. In particular various simulators of the aerodynamic components of the aircraft were designed because wings and control planes were not modelled. In the Low Speed Tests the model was "free to trim", whereas in the High Speed Tests it was restrained from pitching, i. e. runs were performed at a fixed trim. Free to trim characteristics of the seaplane were determined below <b>hump,</b> while <b>resistance</b> and pitching moment characteristics in the planing region were plotted in contours maps up to the take-off. The Longitudinal Stability measurements characterize the stability limits of the flying boat during take-off. The tests were performed in the high speed region, from hump to take-off, with the "free to trim" model. When oscillations occured, the measured damping moment M was combined with the calculated angular velocity in pitch "q", providing the pitch damping moment rate dM/dq. The trim values corresponding to the porpoising limits were plotted on the performance contours maps, and this completes the hydrodynamic characteristics of the seaplane during the take-off...|$|R
40|$|We {{performed}} self-consistent modelling of electrotransport and electromechanical {{response of}} solid electrolyte thin films allowing for steric effects of mobile charged defects (ions, protons or vacancies), electron degeneration and Vegard stresses. We establish {{correlations between the}} features of the space-charge dynamics, current-voltage and bending-voltage curves in the wide frequency range of applied electric voltage. The pronounced ferroelectric-like hysteresis of bending-voltage loops and current maxima on double hysteresis current-voltage loops appear for the electron-open electrodes. The double hysteresis loop with pronounced <b>humps</b> indicates the <b>resistance</b> switching of memristor-type. The switching occurs due to the strong coupling between electronic and ionic subsystem. The sharp meta-stable maximum of the electron density appears near one open electrode and moves to another one during the periodic change of applied voltage. Our results can explain the nature and correlation of electrical and mechanical memory effects in thin films of solid electrolytes. The analytical expression proving that the electrically induced bending of solid electrolyte films can be detected by interferometric methods is derived.

40|$|Summary. [...] Tank {{tests were}} {{required}} {{to find out whether}} the water characteristics of a hull with a main step, faired in both planform and elevation, were comparable with those of a hull with a conventional Vee or transverse step. Stability diagrams and spray and resistance characteristics were obtained over a large range of loadings (Czx 0 = 0. 616 to Czx 0 = 1 - 440). The fully faired step offers more possibility of designing a longitudin ally stable flying boat hull than does the convention al transverse or Vee step, but a hull with such a step is 5 to 10 per cent. less efficient hydrodynamically except at high speed. In order to avoid running too fine at high speed, it is recommended that the centre of gravity should not be more than 0. 46 b ahead of the apex of the step. The modification to the step planform makes little difference to the main spray characteristics, but increase in all-up-weight reduces wing, tailplane and propeller clearances. The effect of increase in load on the porpoising stability characterictics is to raise both limits, with a tendency for the upper limit to rise more rapidly, but less regularly, than the lower limit. The free-to-trim attitudes also rise with increase in all-up-weight. The planing efficiency of the hull increases with increase of load, especially at high speeds. There is evidence of a second <b>resistance</b> <b>hump</b> at high speeds and also of a critical variation of planing efficiency with attitude under simila...|$|R
