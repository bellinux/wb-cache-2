40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the different smear layer morphologies produced by instrumentation with a hand curette and a periodontal sonic scaler <b>for</b> <b>potential</b> <b>removal</b> by soft acidic solution. The effect of a new oxalate-containing phytocomplex spray in preventing tubules exposure after citric acid solution application was also evaluated. Methods: Thirty recently extracted human teeth were used to obtain root dentinal fragments and divided in two groups: Curette treatment (CRT) root planed applying 30 working strokes to each surface using a Gracey?s curette 5 - 6 and Ultrasonic scaler (USC) treated using a periodontal scaler mounted on an ultrasonic hand-piece for 30 seconds. Each principal group was further divided in three sub-groups (Control, Acid challenge and Acid/Phyto-oxalate). The control group samples were immersed in distilled water buffered to pH 7. 4 using NH 4 OH solution. The samples of the acid challenge group were immersed in a solution of citric acid 0, 02 M; [pH 2. 5] for 3 minutes. The samples of the Acid/Phyto-oxalate group were sprayed for 15 sec with a 1. 5 % phytocomplex spray prior to immersion. Samples were examined using SEM. Results: Ultrasonic instrumentation created a very thin smear layer whereas curettes produced a multilayered smear layer. The acidic solution was able to remove the smear layer from root surfaces treated with ultrasonic instrumentation exposing the dentinal tubules. The smear layer on the root surfaces treated with hand instruments was not completely removed. The phytocomplex solution was able to prevent dentinal tubule exposure. Conclusions: Acidic soft drinks are able to remove the smear layer created on root surfaces during different non-surgical periodontally treatments. The smear plugs created by hand instrumentation appeared to be more resistant to acid attack. The tested phytocomplex solution protected the dentine from demineralization and it might prevent post-treatment dentinal hypersensitivity induced by acidic soft drinks...|$|E

40|$|Constructed wetland {{technology}} is gaining increasing attention as a low cost-efficient alternative to high-tech treatment systems for treating municipal and industrial wastewaters especially in small communities. However, its application for grey water reuse has been rarely investigated whilst performance for nutrients (N and P) still remains relatively poor. Pilot scale {{study was conducted}} in which three differently configured subsurface constructed wetlands: a horizontal flow reed bed (HFRB), vertical flow reed bed (VFRB) and a novel system - Green Roof Water Recycling System (GROW) were investigated for their suitability and robustness in treating grey water for reuse across a range of influent strengths to represent the limiting conditions observed in the literature. The HFRB and the GROW systems were found to be generally limited to comply with reuse standards especially at high strength. The release of iron from the HFRB media and particulates from the GROW system contributed to the poor turbidity of the final effluent from these systems. Overall, all wetland configurations were able to effectively treat low strength greywater but only the vertical flow system maintained its robustness when high strength greywater was treated. Analysis of the systems reveals this was {{due to the fact that}} aerobic metabolism is a more suitable treatment pathway for greywater. Ultimately, the performance of the vertical system was slightly lower but comparable to that of a membrane bioreactor making constructed wetlands a suitable technology for greywater recycling. Also, Bauxol, Red mud, Bayoxide, Ochre, Filtralite-P, Steel slag, concrete, Zeolite and various form of limestones were investigated <b>for</b> <b>potential</b> <b>removal</b> of soluble reactive phosphorous (SRP) and metals (Cu and Ni) in final sewage effluent for post Constructed Wetland System. P capacities exhibited by the different adsorbents correlated with type of metal (e. g. Fe, Al, Ca) and their cation exchange capacities. Ochre exhibited the best P removal ability with a P capacity of 26 g Kg- 1 based on a Freundlich isotherm model. The equilibrium sorption capacity of BauxolTM and Ochre based on a Dubinin-Radushkevich model was found to be 4. 1 and 4. 9 mg g- 1 for Cu and Ni unto BauxolTM respectively and 2. 6 and 10. 2 mg g- 1 for Cu and Ni onto Ochre respectively. Kinetic and thermodynamic study revealed a spontaneous and efficient adsorption process via a pseudo-second order mechanism where intraparticle diffusion was shown to be the rate limiting step.

Autotrophic denitrification was observed for both electron acceptors, and NO(x) (-) /S(2 -) ratios defined whether sulfide oxidation was complete or not. Kinetic parameter values obtained for nitrate were higher than for nitrite as electron acceptor. Zero-order models were better adjusted to profiles obtained for suspended cell reactors, whereas first-order models were more adequate for immobilized cell reactors.

40|$|Nitrifying {{wastewater}} treatment plants (WWTPs) are more efficient than non-nitrifying WWTPs to remove several micropollutants such as pharmaceuticals and pesticides. This {{may be related to}} the activity of nitrifying organisms, such as ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOBs), which could possibly co-metabolically oxidize micropollutants with their ammonia monooxygenase (AMO). The role of AOBs in micropollutant removal was investigated with aerobic granular sludge (AGS), a promising technology for municipal WWTPs. Two identical laboratory-scale AGS sequencing batch reactors (AGS-SBRs) were operated with or without nitrification (inhibition of AMOs) to assess their <b>potential</b> <b>for</b> micropollutant <b>removal.</b> Of the 36 micropollutants studied at 1 mu g l(- 1) in synthetic wastewater, nine were over 80 % removed, but 17 were eliminated by less than 20 %. Five substances (bisphenol A, naproxen, irgarol, terbutryn and iohexol) were removed better in the reactor with nitrification, probably due to co-oxidation catalysed by AMOs. However, for the removal of all other micropollutants, AOBs did not seem to play a significant role. Many compounds were better removed in aerobic condition, suggesting that aerobic heterotrophic organisms were involved in the degradation.

Discharges containing cadmium, in particular, are strictly controlled because of the highly toxic nature of this element and its tendency to accumulate in the tissues of living organisms.
