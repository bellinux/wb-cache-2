Below around 700 °C (727 °C in <b>eutectic</b> <b>iron)</b> the austenite is thermodynamically unstable and, under equilibrium conditions, it will undergo a eutectoid reaction and form pearlite - an interleaved mixture of ferrite and cementite (Fe3C).

40|$|Abstract. Successful {{inoculation}} is {{not guaranteed}} and effects {{may even be}} deleterious. The main risks are the appearance of types B and D graphite, associated with ferrite and/or carbides {{due to lack of}} control of undercooling during eutectic solidification.

Sulphur and aluminium content in a molten iron are considered to be the main factors to control the degree of eutectic undercooling, graphite morphology and inoculation efficiency.

The carbon nanofibers seem to form either in the vapor phase [5, 6] or over catalyst deposited on supported material [7, 8]. A sulfur compound (elemental sulfur, hydrogen sulfides, thiophene) is essential with metal catalyst to promote the catalytic growth for CNFs formation [6, 9]. It helps to increase the reaction kinetics which reduces the soot formation and leads to formation of thickened carbon nanofiber [6]. Small amount of such impurity helps to produce fibers of reasonable quality and good yields. In an earlier study {{it was observed that}} without any hydrogen sulfides in the feedstock, a negligible amount of fibers formed and the major products was soot [9]. Sulfur plays an important role for the formation of CNFs as it liquefies iron particle that enhances CNFs formation.

40|$|International audienceOur {{objective}} is to understand how graphite can be formed at "low" temperatures (< 1200 °C) {{in contrast to the}} high temperature of the industrial processes (∼ 3000 °C), and from precursors which are non-graphitizable by a thermal treatment alone. Blends of iron and saccharose char were heated between 650 and 1600 °C. The carbons obtained were characterized by SEM, TEM and Raman microspectrometry. Our work confirms that graphite can be formed from non-graphitizable carbons during a heat-treatment in the presence of iron. Carbon and iron migrations, below the eutectic temperature (1150 °C), appear to be a key factor for carbon transformation. Iron migration and graphitization could be favored by nucleation of Fe nanoparticles and surface melting, detected as soon as 900 °C. This allows formation of turbostratic macroporous carbons.

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of iron, its thermal {{state and its}} phase in the accreting Earth probably {{played a major role}} in the Earth's early thermal evolution. Plausible impact thermal histories make it possible that pure iron was molten in the accreting Earth after it was about 10 % grown. Hence, <b>iron</b> <b>eutectic</b> alloys (FeS, FeO) certainly were. Additionally, the initial temperature of the core is an important constraint on the secular cooling of the early Earth and on the strength of the early geodynamo. Whether iron is solid or molten would influence geochemical equilibria in the upper and lower mantle; the mode of core formation, by spherical or near-spherical blobs, stalk-like instabilities, or something more catastrophic would influence the partitioning of siderophiles between silicate and iron phases. Early descent of iron (during accretion) favors partitioning according to low-pressure phase equilibria, whereas late descent favors higher pressure. The later core formation occurs, the greater the heat pulse, due to the strong dependence of gravitational potential energy on planetary radius. The heat may homogenize the mantle if core formation is global; otherwise, heterogeneity of iron differentiation may leave some of the pre-archean mantle unaffected.

30|$|Our view of {{the deep}} {{interiors}} of the terrestrial planets and moons, and their magnetic fields, has changed substantially {{over the past decade}} as a consequence of insights from recent space missions, new experimental data that have become available, and the results of more detailed and sophisticated numerical models. Because the evolution of a planet’s magnetic field is closely linked to its thermal evolution, constraints on the dynamo in iron (Fe)-rich cores will help provide a better understanding of a planet’s evolution in general. For instance, the MESSENGER mission has collected new magnetic field data for Mercury (e.g., Anderson et al. 2011; Johnson et al. 2015), and lunar samples have been reanalyzed with improved paleomagnetic methods (for a review, see Weiss and Tikoo 2014 among others). Space missions have further helped to better constrain the surface compositions of planets and to provide better constraints on geochemical models of their interiors. MESSENGER spectroscopic data show that the planet is more volatile rich than previously thought and additionally suggest that it was formed and differentiated under reducing conditions (Nittler et al. 2011; Weider et al. 2012). Therefore, the core is now thought to be composed of Fe–Si–S (e.g., Malavergne et al. 2010; Chabot et al. 2014) rather than Fe–S, which is generally taken as a good model for Earth-like planetary cores. Experimental data relevant to Fe–FeS eutectic melting relations (Fei et al. 1997, 2000; Chudinovskikh and Boehler 2007; Stewart et al. 2007; Chen et al. 2008; Buono and Walker 2011) suggest that crystallization in the core can proceed substantially differently in small planets compared with the Earth’s core. In small planets, iron may start crystallizing at the core–mantle boundary (CMB) rather than in the center, and iron snow may form (e.g., Hauck et al. 2006). As a consequence, a dynamo that is tied to crystallization may work differently in these planets than it would in Earth. Moreover, for a core richer in sulfur than the <b>eutectic</b> composition, <b>iron</b> sulfide (FeS) will crystallize first and also result in a different crystallization process as compared with crystallization on the iron-rich side of the eutectic.|$|R
30|$|Recent {{planetary}} space missions, new experimental data, {{and advanced}} numerical techniques {{have helped to}} improve {{our understanding of the}} deep interiors of the terrestrial planets and moons. In the present review, we summarize recent insights into the state and composition of their iron (Fe)-rich cores, as well as recent findings about the magnetic field evolution of Mercury, the Moon, Mars, and Ganymede. Crystallizing processes in iron-rich cores that differ from the classical Earth case (i.e., Fe snow and iron sulfide (FeS) crystallization) have been identified and found to be important in the cores of terrestrial bodies. The Fe snow regime occurs at pressures lower than that in the Earth’s core on the iron-rich side of the <b>eutectic,</b> where <b>iron</b> freezes first close to the core–mantle boundary rather than in the center. FeS crystallization, instead, occurs on the sulfur-rich side of the eutectic. Depending on the core temperature profile and the pressure range considered, FeS crystallizes either in the core center or close to the core–mantle boundary. The consequences of the various crystallizing mechanisms for core dynamics and magnetic field generation are discussed. For the Moon, revised paleomagnetic data obtained with advanced techniques suggest a peculiar history of its internal dynamo, with an early strong field persisting between 4.25 and 3.5  Ga, and subsequently a much weaker field. In addition, the long-lasting dynamo and the possible presence of an inner core, as inferred from a revised interpretation of Apollo seismic data, suggest core crystallization as a viable process of magnetic field generation for a substantial period during lunar evolution. The present-day magnetic fields of Mercury and Ganymede (if they occur on the iron-rich side of the Fe–FeS eutectic) and the related dynamo action are likely generated in the Fe snow regime and seem to be recent features. An earlier dynamo in Mercury would have been powered differently. For Mercury, MESSENGER data further suggest core formation under reducing conditions that may have resulted in an Fe–S–Si composition, further complicating the core crystallization process. Mars, with its early and strong paleo-field, likely has not yet started to freeze out an inner iron core.|$|R

Many of the linear areas intersected the sample edge at notches present before the tests or followed linear flaws visible in pre-test images. Compositions of corrosion products differed significantly from the bulk composition, and the maximum observed concentration of U in corrosion products (~ 25 at%) slightly exceeded the highest reported values in actinide-bearing phases in uncorroded surrogate MWF samples with comparable concentrations of U (~ 17 - 19 at%) ...|$|R
40|$|The work is {{particularly}} aimed at metallurgical problems connected with manufacture of castings of weight about 1 up to 40 tons from high-alloy austenitic nickel cast irons also known under the trade name Ni-resist. The main {{aim is to}} check and complement the knowledge about manufacture of heavy castings from austenitic nickel cast irons {{in a field of}} control of tapping and casting temperature, carbon content control with regard to the prediction of eutectic composition and in a field of setting a suitable chemical composition of cast iron with regard to the formation of chunky graphite and stability of the austenitic matrix and further on also possibilities of cast iron filtration during pouring the castings. Based on done experiments the formulae were determined that enable to calculate eutectic and liquidus temperatures on the basis of chemical composition of the cast iron. The use of several formulae given in the literature for calculating the carbon equivalent of austenitic nickel cast irons was compared and evaluated. For utilization of determined results in practice a calculating programme has been compiled making possible to be used in operational practice. This programme is named Calculation of casting temperature of Ni-resist cast irons. After the entry of the melt chemical composition the programme calculates the all important parameters necessary to know and to be controlled for manufacture of high quality castings from austenitic nickel cast <b>irons.</b> <b>Eutectic</b> temperature, liquidus temperature and then based on it the tapping and casting temperatures are included among those parameters. Further on there are eutectic concentration of carbon, carbon equivalent, nickel equivalent, and a criterion evaluating a danger of chunky graphite formation...|$|R
40|$|Argonne National Laboratory has {{developed}} an electrometallurgical process for conditioning spent sodium-bonded metallic reactor fuel prior to disposal. A waste stream from this process consists of stainless steel cladding hulls that contain undissolved metal fission products such as Tc, Ru, Rh, Pd, and Ag; {{a small amount of}} undissolved actinides (U, Np, Pu) also remains with the hulls. These wastes will be immobilized in a waste form whose baseline composition is stainless steel alloyed with 15 wt% Zr (SS- 15 Zr). Scanning electron microscope (SEM) observations of simulated metal waste forms (SS- 15 Zr with added actinides) show <b>eutectic</b> intergrowths of <b>iron</b> solid-solution (''steel'') and Fe-Zr-Cr-Ni (''intermetallic'') materials. The actinide elements are almost entirely in the intermetallic materials, where they occur in concentrations as high as 20 at%. Neutron- and electron-diffraction studies of the simulated waste forms show materials with structures similar to those of Fe{sub 2 }Zr and Fe{sub 23 }Zr{sub 6 }. New TEM observations of simulated waste form samples with compositions SS- 15 Zr- 2 Np, SS- 15 Zr- 5 U, SS- 15 Zr- 11 U- 0. 6 Ru- 0. 3 Tc- 0. 1 Pd, and SS- 15 Zr- 10 Pu suggest that the major U- and Pu-bearing phase has a structure {{similar to that of the}} C 15 (cubic, MgCu{sub 2 }-type) polymorph of Fe{sub 2 }Zr. Materials with this structure exhibit significant variability in chemical compositions and actinide concentrations up to 20 at% (normalized so that atomic fractions of Cr, Ni, Fe, and Zr add up to 1). A U-bearing material similar to the C 36 (dihexagonal, MgNi{sub 2 }-type) polymorph of Fe{sub 2 }Zr was also observed. Chemical variability in materials with the C 36 Fe{sub 2 }Zr structure is smaller than in those with the C 15 Fe{sub 2 }Zr structure, and U concentrations are less than 5 at%. Uranium concentrations up to 5 at. % were observed in materials with the Fe{sub 23 }Zr{sub 6 } (cubic, Mn{sub 23 }Th{sub 6 }-type) structure. Microstructures similar to those produced during experimental deformation of Fe- 10 at% Zr alloys were observed in intermetallic materials in all of the simulated waste form samples. Stacking faults and associated dislocations are common in samples with U, but rarely observed in those with Np and Pu, while twins occur in all samples. Previously reported differences in dissolution behavior between samples with different actinides may be related to increased defect-assisted dissolution in samples with U...|$|R
40|$|The <b>eutectic</b> {{temperature}} between <b>iron</b> {{and carbon}} is 1150 °C. This {{is the lowest}} temperature in which Fe-C solution can be tapped from a blast furnace. Current operating temperatures of iron blast furnace are much higher than 1150 ° Cand limited bymelting temperature of the slag. There is room to lower the operating temperature of the iron blast furnace. As a result, coke consumption and CO 2 gas emissions can be reduced and campaign length of the furnace can be increased. Akey factor in achieving the low operating temperature of the blast furnace is to use an optimum slag composition that can be tapped at low temperature. Phase equilibria studies have been undertaken in the system "TiO 2 "-CaO/MgO-Al 2 O 3 SiO 2 at carbon saturation. Extensive experimental data are presented {{in the form of}} pseudoternary "TiO 2 "-(CaO+MgO) - (Al 2 O 3 +SiO 2) at fixedMgO/CaO and Al 2 O 3 /SiO 2 ratios. Melting temperatures of complex slag are described as functions of basicity weight ratio (CaO+MgO) /(SiO 2 +Al 2 O 3) and TiOx concentration. The phase diagrams determined in this study explain the behaviour of titanium-containing slag such as Panzhihua ironmaking slag. These diagrams will be used for selection of optimum slag composition with low liquidus temperature for both Ti-free and Ticontaining slag. The possibility of lowering ironmaking temperature by adding titania has been discussed based on the experimental data determined in this study. A large amount of iron blast furnace slag containing 20 - 25 wt% "TiO 2 " are produced in Panzhihua Iron & Steel. "TiO 2 " has to be concentrated before it can be efficiently extracted from the slag. It was found in this study that titanium is present in the blast furnace slag mainly in two minerals, perovskite CaTiO 3 and pseudobrookite (Mg 2 +,Al 3 +,Ti 3 +,Ti 4 +) 3 O 5. Electron probe X-ray microanalysis (EPMA) has been used to determine phase assemblage of the slag quenched from high temperature and the compositions of the phases. It was found that "TiO 2 " is 58 wt% in perovskite and 80 - 90 wt% in pseudobrookite. The particle size of the pseudobrookite is much larger than that of the perovskite. It was found that the composition of the current Panzhihua ironmaking slag is located in the perovskite primary phase field. The maximum "TiO 2 " concentration in the recovered materials is only 58 wt% if the crystal phase is perovskite. With the information provided in this study {{it may be possible to}} recover "TiO 2 " from the Panzhihua slag in the form of pseudobrookite so that recovered materials contains 80 - 90 wt% "TiO 2 " and can be used directly for production of pure TiO 2...|$|R
