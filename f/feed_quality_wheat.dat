40|$|AbstractWheat {{is a very}} {{variable}} grain {{in terms}} of its physical and chemical characteristics. Of its physical characteristics, hardness appears {{to be the most important}} quality, having the greatest influence on broiler performance and nutrient digestibility. The effect of wheat hardness on broiler performance is also likely to be influenced by feed form (e. g. mash versus pelleted feed). For the chemical characteristics, the level and structure of the non starch polysaccharides (NSP) are important criteria in determining the <b>feeding</b> <b>quality</b> of the <b>wheat.</b> With regard to enzyme response, most research has focused on the chemical structure, in particular NSP level of the wheat with little attention on the importance of the physical quality.

40|$|Comparisons of Maris Widgeon, an old taller {{breadmaking}} variety, {{were made}} with more modern varieties of wheat in eight successive field experiments between 1987 / 88 and 1994 / 95 at Harnhill Manor Farm, Cirencester, Gloucestershire, U. K. for grain yield, specific weight, protein concentration, SDS-sedimentation volume and Hagberg falling number. The effect of quality of the grain on financial value was investigated by applying a range of penalties for insufficient protein, Hagberg falling number and specific weight. Values for <b>feed</b> and breadmaking <b>quality</b> <b>wheat</b> were also varied. For all of the different pricing scenarios, grain from Maris Widgeon was of lower value than that from the most modern variety. The higher protein concentration of Maris Widgeon, in comparison with Hereward, was insufficient to compensate for lower yields and Hagberg falling numbers. Reduced height genes (Rht 1 and Rht 2) in isogenic lines of Maris Widgeon, studied in one field experiment, increased grain yield and Hagberg falling number but reduced protein content. Interactions of variety with other factors relevant to organic systems were also investigated namely undersowing (four seasons), defoliation by mowing or sheep grazing in Spring (three seasons), and sowing date (two seasons) but these factors had little impact on the relative grain performance of the varieties studied. authorsversionPeer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Different F 5 {{recombinant}} {{inbred lines}} from the cross Yumai 34 × Ukrainka were grown in replicated trials on a single site in one harvest year at Rothamsted Research. A total of 10 samples from those lines were harvested and used in a broiler experiment. Twenty nutritionally complete meal-form diets that had 630 g/kg of wheat with different amounts of pentosan, with and without exogenous xylanase supplementation, were used to compare broiler growth performance and determine apparent metabolizable energy corrected for N retention (AMEn). We {{examined the relationship between}} the nutritive value of the wheat samples and their chemical compositions and results of quality tests. The amounts of total and water soluble pentosans in wheat samples ranged from 36. 7 to 48. 0 g/kg DM, and 6. 7 to 11. 6 g/kg DM, respectively. The mean crude oil and protein contents of the wheat samples were 10. 5 and 143. 9 g/kg DM, respectively. The average determined value for the kinematic viscosity was 0. 0018 mPa. s, and 2. 1 mPa. s for the dynamic viscosity. The AMEn of the wheat-based diets had a maximum range of 0. 47 MJ/kg DM within the ten wheat samples that were tested. Xylanase supplementation improved (P < 0. 05) dietary AMEn, dry matter, and fat digestibility coefficients. There was a positive (P < 0. 05) relationship between in vitro kinematic viscosity of the wheat samples and the total pentosan content. There was a negative relationship between the total pentosan content in the wheat and broiler growth performance. An increase by 10 g of pentosan per kg of wheat reduced (P < 0. 001) daily feed intake and weight gain by 2. 9 [*]g and 3. 5 [*]g, respectively. The study shows that the <b>feeding</b> <b>quality</b> of <b>wheat</b> samples can be predicted by their total pentosan content.

40|$|The {{determination}} of forage quality {{is one of}} the most important factors essential to appropriate field management. The most important factor, effective on forage quality, is the growth stage; by studying on phenological stages of the forage, suitable grazing time can be determined. Since different cultivars of forage crops have different <b>feed</b> <b>qualities</b> at each of their growth stages, for the purpose of investigation of genetic diversity of forage yields and their quantitative characters, we studied three foxtail millet cultivars, KFM 1, KFM 6 and KFM 9, at three phenological stages including vegetative growth stage, flowering stage and seeding stage by use of a factorial experimental design with a complete block basic design with 3 replications in Karaj, Iran, during 2008 - 2009. Except for acid detergent fiber (ADF) and crude fibre percentage, the differences between the other <b>feed</b> <b>quality</b> indices as well as wet and dry yields, among the different cultivars and the three growth phases of the cultivars, were significant (P< 0. 01). Further, the interaction effect between different cultivars and also the phenological growth stages was statistically significant only in connection with wet and dry yield. Proportional to the development of growth stages, approximately in all cultivars the crude protein percentage and digestive dry material percentage decreased and the fibre content increased.

Here, we report the occurrence and strength of relationships among extractable nutrients in soils and CR <b>feed</b> <b>quality</b> traits, and the effects of improved nutrients input on feed availability and <b>feed</b> <b>quality</b> of CR. Soil samples were collected from farmers’ fields in the semiarid zone of Karnataka and analyzed for available phosphorus (P), potassium (K), sulphur (S), zinc (Zn) and boron (B) using standard laboratory methods. Soil test results were clustered as low, medium or high based on the level of nutrient concentration. Four major farming systems involving nine crops and 419 farms were selected for on-farm trials. Under every sample farm, a plot with farmer’s practice (control) and improved fertilizer inputs (combined application of nutrients found deficient by soil testing) were laid. Performance of crops was recorded. Samples were collected for CR <b>feed</b> <b>quality</b> trait analysis using Near Infrared Reflectance Spectroscopy. The result showed that for cereal and oil crops, extractable soil S was significantly negatively associated with anti-feed quality traits such as neutral detergent fibre (NDF), acid detergent fibre (ADF), acid detergent lignin (ADL) (P < 0. 01), but significantly positively related to metabolizable energy (ME) and in vitro digestibility (P < 0. 01). Extractable B and K levels were associated positively and significantly with NDF, ADF and ADL for oil crops and cereals. Crop level associations, for most crops, showed similar trend. Improved fertilizer inputs affected CR yield much more than it did the quality. It increased ME productivity (ME ha− 1) and thereof the potential milk yield ha− 1 by as high as 40 % over the control.
