5|$|Beginning in 1619, {{the ethnic}} Manchu Qing dynasty forced all men in China {{to adopt the}} queue: a long braid down the back with the hair near the {{forehead}} completely shaved. Hair length and style became a life-or-death matter in 1645 as the Manchu told them either their hair or their <b>head</b> <b>would</b> be cut.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the NWOBHM {{had broken}} into the mainstream, as albums by Iron Maiden and Saxon, as well as Motörhead, reached the British top 10. Though less commercially successful, other NWOBHM bands such as Venom and Diamond <b>Head</b> <b>would</b> have a {{significant}} influence on metal's development. In 1981, Motörhead became the first of this new breed of metal bands to top the UK charts with No Sleep 'til Hammersmith.|$|E

5|$|His earlier {{insistence on}} not filming with live {{ammunition}} {{proved to be}} a good decision. Having been told while filming Angels with Dirty Faces that he would be doing a scene with real machine gun bullets (a common practice in the Hollywood of the time), Cagney refused and insisted the shots be added afterwards. As it turned out, a ricocheting bullet passed through exactly where his <b>head</b> <b>would</b> have been.|$|E
5|$|If {{traditional}} Hunanese customs were adhered to, the baby's <b>head</b> <b>would</b> {{have been}} shaved after four weeks, {{with a small}} tuft of hair left on the crown and {{at the nape of}} the neck; it was at this point that the child would have been officially given its name. According to tradition, visitors probably would have gathered for this ceremony, bringing gifts of money, pork, fish, fruit, and decorated eggs.|$|E
5|$|June's {{body and}} {{clothing}} were heavily bloodstained; {{she was found}} in her nightdress with bare feet. The police believe she had been sitting up during part of the attack, based on the pattern of blood on her clothing. She was found {{lying on the floor}} by the door of the master bedroom. She had been shot seven times. One shot to her forehead, between her eyes, was fired from under one foot away. That and another shot to the right side of her <b>head</b> <b>would</b> both have caused her death quickly, the court heard. There were also shots to the right side of her lower neck, her right forearm, and two injuries {{on the right side of}} her chest and right knee.|$|E

5|$|Machine Head {{was formed}} when Flynn felt musically {{unfulfilled}} with his bands Forbidden and Vio-lence and requested {{to start a}} side project. When his request was denied, he left the band and formed Machine Head in 1991 with Duce, Logan Mader and Tony Constanza. The band's first album, Burn My Eyes, was a big success in Europe where it garnered attention on MTV's Headbangers Ball. In America (with HBB taken off the air during the grunge movement) Machine <b>Head</b> <b>would</b> not have success until later albums.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the single}} {{was never a}} {{physical}} CD release, artwork was created for it. The artwork featured the headless man who is otherwise seen throughout the releases for other singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, however on this cover, the area where his <b>head</b> <b>would</b> be is a fireball, and {{he appears to be}} holding a briefcase while walking down the hallway of a hotel, another common theme throughout the artwork for the album. Unlike the last two singles from Dream Days at the Hotel Existence, the artwork doesn't follow the picture-in-picture theme.|$|E
5|$|Waste is {{delivered}} to the station by road, using up to 100 waste collection vehicles. Up to 2,800 tonnes of waste a week or as much as 1,000 tonnes of waste a day, can be delivered at the plant. A rail head was also built on the railway sidings adjacent to the site in 2009. This allows for waste to be {{delivered to the}} plant by rail, rather than just by road. This is more sustainable as it reduces the amount of traffic on local roads. In December 2011, {{it was announced that}} the rail <b>head</b> <b>would</b> be used to receive up 500,000 tonnes of residual waste per year from Merseyside via a rail waste transfer facility at Knowley Industrial Park, Kirby, in a contract worth £400million.|$|E

5|$|Yagan's head {{spent some}} time in storage in a bank vault before being handed over to {{forensics}} experts who reconstructed a model from it. After that it was held in storage at Western Australia's state mortuary. Plans to re-bury the head were repeatedly deferred, causing ongoing conflict between Noongar groups. In September 2008 it was reported that Yagan's <b>head</b> <b>would</b> be reburied in November, and a Yagan Memorial Park created as a projected cost of A$996,000; but in November it was announced that the reburial had been rescheduled for July 2009 because of logistical problems. In March 2009, it was announced that the Department of Indigenous Affairs had given the City of Swan more than A$500,000 to develop the park.|$|E
5|$|Another legend narrated in the Arakanese chronicle {{relates to}} the nine {{phenomena}} that occurred when the image was consecrated in the temple and continued to occur after the Buddha had departed. These nine phenomena were: holy water used for washing the image would not overflow the collecting vessels; {{the water from the}} tank that was used for washing the Buddha's <b>head</b> <b>would</b> retain its quality throughout the year; six coloured rays appeared when the devotees worshipped the image in the evenings; the rays faded in the presence of non-believers; the space in the temple would automatically accommodate any number of devotees; the leaves of trees would tilt {{in the direction of the}} Buddha image; birds would not fly over the temple; and the stone guardians at the entrance would sense the presence of evil doers and prevent them from entering the temple.|$|E
5|$|Oppenheimer {{had already}} {{recruited}} key people for Parson's Ordnance Division. Edwin McMillan was a physicist {{who headed the}} Proving Ground Group. His first task was to establish the ordnance test area. Later he became Parsons' deputy for the gun-type fission weapon. Charles Critchfield, a mathematical physicist with ordnance experience at the Army's Aberdeen Proving Ground, {{was in charge of}} the Target, Projectile and Source Group. Kenneth Bainbridge arrived in August to take charge of the Instrumentation Group. Parsons recruited Robert Brode from the proximity fuze project to become head of the Fuze Development Group. Joseph Hirschfelder was brought in as an expert on internal ballistics, and headed the Interior Ballistics Group. From the beginning, Parsons wanted Norman Ramsey as the head of the delivery group. Edward L. Bowles, the scientific adviser to the Secretary of War, Henry L. Stimson, was reluctant to part with Ramsey, but gave way under pressure from Groves, Tolman and Bush. Perhaps the most controversial group <b>head</b> <b>would</b> be Seth Neddermeyer, the head of the Implosion Experimentation Group; for the time being, Parson accorded a relatively low priority to this work. He also recruited Hazel Greenbacker as his secretary.|$|E

5|$|The TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal and {{the debut}} of the X Division TerrorDome were {{promoted}} as featured matches for the Sacrifice undercard. The TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal was announced by Cornette on the April24 episode of Impact!. The rules of the contest involved two stages: a standard battle royal in which competitors fought to eliminate wrestlers by throwing them over the top rope and a ladder match in which the final two wrestles fought to retrieve a contract that had been hung above the ring. An added stipulation to the bout was that the loser's <b>head</b> <b>would</b> be shaved and the winner would earn a TNA Women's Knockout Championship match. On the May8 episode of Impact!, Gail Kim won a Ten-Woman Clippers on a Pole match that granted her immunity from having her head shaven if she lost at the event. During the April24 episode of Impact!, TNA announced plans to introduce a new match type in the near future. The TerrorDome was announced on the May1 episode of Impact!, and the participants were announced on the May8 episode. The participants were Alex Shelley, Chris Sabin, Consequences Creed, Curry Man, Jay Lethal, Jimmy Rave, Johnny Devine, Kaz, Shark Boy, and Sonjay Dutt.|$|E
5|$|The {{director}} of the episode, Cliff Bole, was a school friend of makeup supervisor Michael Westmore. The scene with Remmick {{at the end of}} the episode was added in post-production, as it was originally scripted to have Riker and Picard come face to face with a full-sized mother creature. The part where the parasite enters Remmick's throat reportedly took many takes because the bulging effect was made by Westmore blowing into air bladders under a false neck, and Bole kept trying to make Westmore hyperventilate from the exertion. The parasites themselves were created by Makeup & Effects Laboratories from a design by Rick Sternbach. A mold of Paul Newman's face was filled with raw meat and then blown up to create the effect used when Picard and Riker fire on Remmick, but both Rick Berman and Peter Lauritson were concerned that it was too graphic. Dan Curry invited his six-year-old son to watch the episode in order to test how children would react to it; the boy reportedly liked it so much that he suggested the creation of a Remmick action figure whose <b>head</b> <b>would</b> blow up by pressing a button. This resulted in Berman deciding to air the episode uncut with the full sequence included.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea for}} the episode {{can be traced back}} to an early idea Vince Gilligan, the writer of the episode, had. His {{original}} idea featured a man holding an individual hostage on a Tilt-A-Whirl. Gilligan pitched this idea at several meetings and it soon became a recurring joke. Most of the comments Gilligan received noted that his premise lacked an explicit mystery to investigate and so Gilligan decided that after the ride was shut off, the man's <b>head</b> <b>would</b> explode. Researching various government experiments, Gilligan discovered the controversial use of low-frequency waves. The secret military experiment featured in this episode is based on two real-life military experiments, Project HAARP and Project ELF. The former is a U.S. Army experiment dealing with electromagnetic radiation in the Earth's ionosphere, and the second is a U.S. Navy experiment dealing with long wavelengths. Thus, a script was crafted that featured an individual that, due to a secret experiment, could not slow down for fear of rupturing his head.|$|E
2500|$|Many of the Dead <b>Heads</b> <b>would</b> go on {{tour with}} the band. As a group, the Dead Heads were {{considered}} very mellow.

50|$|In the Rāmāyaṇa, Nalakūvara’s {{would be}} wife Rambha {{was raped by}} his uncle, Rāvaṇa. In some {{versions}} of the Ramayana, Nalakūvara curses Rāvaṇa, so that if Rāvaṇa touches any woman without permission, his <b>heads</b> <b>would</b> explode. This curse protected the chastity of Sītā, the wife of Rāma, after she was kidnapped by Rāvaṇa.|$|R

"I {{realized}} when I {{thought about}} it calmly that if we failed in our mission our <b>heads</b> <b>would</b> roll, and if we succeeded we'd have to commit seppuku afterwards. either way, it was certain death.

5|$|In 1997, the American {{palaeontologist}} Kenneth Carpenter {{pointed out}} that the dorsal vertebrae {{from the back of the}} pachycephalosaur Homalocephale show that the back curved downwards just before the neck (which was not preserved), and unless the neck curved upwards, the <b>head</b> <b>would</b> point to the ground. He therefore inferred that the necks of Stegoceras and other pachycephalosaurs were held in a curved posture (as is the norm in dinosaurs), and that they would therefore not have been able to align their head, neck, and body horizontally straight, which would be needed to transmit stress. Their necks would have to be held below the level of the back, which would have risked damaging the spinal cord on impact. Modern bighorn sheep and bison overcome this problem by having strong ligaments from the neck to the tall neural spines over the shoulders (which absorb the force of impact), but such features are not known in pachycephalosaurs. These animals also absorb the force of impact through sinus chambers at the base of their horns, and their foreheads and horns form a broad contact surface, unlike the narrow surface of pachycephalosaur domes. Because the dome of Stegoceras was rounded, it would have given a very small area for potential impact, and the domes would have glanced off each other (unless the impact was perfectly centred). Combating pachycephalosaurs would have had difficulty seeing each other while their heads were lowered, due to the bony ridges above the eyes.|$|E
5|$|The first {{main event}} match was the TNA Knockouts Makeover Battle Royal, {{the winner of}} which would become the number one {{contender}} to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship. It involved Angelina Love, Christy Hemme, Gail Kim, Jackie Moore, ODB, Salinas, Rhaka Khan, Roxxi Laveaux, Traci Brooks, and Velvet Sky. This contest involved two stages; {{the first was a}} standard battle royal. After all but two wrestlers were eliminated, stage two, a ladder match, began. The winner of the ladder match would become the number one contender to the TNA Women's Knockout Championship; the loser would have her head shaved. The final four were Kim, Laveaux, Love, and ODB. The next eliminated was ODB, followed by Love; both were eliminated by Laveaux. Only Kim and Laveaux remained for the ladder match portion. Kim had won immunity on the May8 episode of Impact!, so if Laveaux won the match, then Love's <b>head</b> <b>would</b> be shaven. Love and Sky interfered in the contest several times. During the bout, as Kim and Laveaux stood on the ladder, Kim flipped over Laveaux, grabbed her around the legs, and slammed her into the mat back-first with a powerbomb. Laveaux's head was legitimately cut open during this stage. Later, while Laxeaux climbed the ladder in an attempt to retrieve the contract, Love interfered by pushing the ladder over. Kim followed by climbing the ladder and grabbing the contract to win the encounter at ten minutes. Afterwards, Laveaux was forced to have her head shaven.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, {{although}} {{before each}} {{series of tests}} Head and Rivers would discuss their plan of action, Rivers was careful to vary this order {{to such an extent}} during the actual testing that <b>Head</b> <b>would</b> be unable to tell what was coming next.|$|E
