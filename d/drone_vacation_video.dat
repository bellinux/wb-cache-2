40|$|We {{present an}} {{approach}} for identifying picturesque highlights from {{large amounts of}} egocentric video data. Given a set of egocentric videos captured {{over the course of}} a vacation, our method analyzes the videos and looks for images that have good picturesque and artistic properties. We introduce novel techniques to automatically determine aesthetic features such as composition, symmetry and color vibrancy in egocentric videos and rank the video frames based on their photographic qualities to generate highlights. Our approach also uses contextual information such as GPS, when available, to assess the relative importance of each geographic location where the <b>vacation</b> <b>videos</b> were shot. Furthermore, we specifically leverage the properties of egocentric videos to improve our highlight detection. We demonstrate results on a new egocentric vacation dataset which includes 26. 5 hours of videos taken over a 14 day vacation that spans many famous tourist destinations and also provide results from a user-study to access our results...|$|R

50|$|Lee and Anderson had videotaped {{their sexual}} {{activities}} while on <b>vacation.</b> The <b>video</b> was stolen in 1995 and released on the Internet, becoming {{a prime example}} of viral pornography. According to The Dirt, Lee claims that he was having work done at his house, and a person (who, according to the book, was a former porn star by the name of Rand Gauthier) working at the house found the tape and sold it. Anderson sued the video distribution company, Internet Entertainment Group. Ultimately, the Lees entered into a confidential settlement agreement with IEG. Thereafter, the company began making the tape available to subscribers to its Web sites again, resulting in triple the normal traffic on the site.|$|R

One episode in season three did not include a vacation because a family's daughter was in isolation at a local hospital. As the family took <b>vacation,</b> they received <b>video</b> messages via computer laptop from Pennington's camera. The videos displayed on the laptop were superimposed on broadcasts to avoid both screen glare and the requirement of paying advertising royalties on the software used in the videos.|$|R

40|$|Millions of {{individuals}} explore virtual worlds every day, for entertainment, training, or to plan business trips and <b>vacations.</b> <b>Video</b> games such as Eve Online, World of Warcraft, {{and many others}} popularized their existence. Sand boxes such as Minecraft and Second Life illustrated how they {{can serve as a}} media, letting people create, share and even sell their virtual productions. Navigation and exploration software such as Google Earth and Virtual Earth let us explore a virtual version of the real world, and let us enrich it with information shared between the millions of users using these services every day. Virtual environments are massive, dynamic 3 D scenes, that are explored and manipulated interactively bythousands of users simultaneously. Many challenges have to be solved to achieve these goals. Among those lies the key question of content management. How can we create enough detailed graphical content so as to represent an immersive, convincing and coherent world? Even if we can produce this data, how can we then store the terra–bytes it represents, and transfer it for display to each individual users? Rich virtual environments require a massive amount of varied graphical content, so as to represent an immersive, convincing and coherent world. Creating this content is extremely time consuming for computer artists and requires a specific set of technical skills. Capturing the data from the real world can simplify this task but then requires a large quantity of storage, expensive hardware and long capture campaigns. While this is acceptable for important landmarks (e. g. the statue of Liberty in New York, the Eiffel tower in Paris) this is wasteful on generic or anonymous landscapes. In addition, in many cases capture is not an option, either because an imaginary scenery is required or because the scene to be represented no longer exists. Therefore, researchers have proposed methods to generate new content programmatically, using captured data as an example. Typically, building blocks are extracted from the example content and re–assembled to form new assets. Such approaches have {{been at the center of}} my research for the past ten years. However, algorithms for generating data programmatically only partially address the content management challenge: the algorithm generates content as a (slow) pre–process and its output has to be stored for later use. On the contrary, I have focused on proposing models and algorithms which can produce graphical content while minimizing storage. The content is either generated when it is needed for the current viewpoint, or is produced under a very compact form that can be later used for rendering. Thanks to such approaches developers gain time during content creation, but this also simplifies the distribution of the content by reducing the required data bandwidth. In addition to the core problem of content synthesis, my approaches required the development of new data-structures able to store sparse data generated during display, while enabling an efficient access. These data-structures are specialized for the massive parallelism of graphics processors. I contributed early in this domain and kept a constant focus on this area. The originality of my approach has thus been to consider simultaneously the problems of generating, storing and displaying the graphical content. As we shall see, each of these area involve different theoretical and technical backgrounds, that nicely complement each other in providing elegant solutions to content generation, management and display...|$|R
5000|$|On the June 16, 2006 {{episode of}} SmackDown vignettes {{designed}} to look like <b>vacation</b> promotion <b>videos</b> for Quebec and starring Sylvan ("the Ambassador at Large for the Beautiful Province of Québec", or [...] "the Ambassador of Québec" [...] for short) began airing. On July 7 he appeared in-ring to cut a promo attempting to [...] "make peace" [...] with the US fans by welcoming them to visit his home province. The fans responded with a chorus of boos and a loud [...] "USA" [...] chant. In the coming weeks he continued to appear backstage, telling everyone within earshot how much better Québec was than where ever they were from. He made his ring return with this gimmick on the July 28 SmackDown with a win over Tatanka. Sylvan {{would go on to}} job against the likes of Tatanka, Vito, and Batista under this gimmick. Sylvan's losing streak ended on the first CW Network episode of SmackDown on September 22, 2006, when he defeated Tatanka again by using the ring ropes for illegal leverage. The following week on SmackDown, Sylvan defeated Jimmy Wang Yang, who had insulted Canada the week before. The next week, Sylvan cheated again to take a lead in the feud. The following week, Sylvan finally lost to Yang in a six-man tag team match. After disappearing for a couple of weeks, Sylvan finally returned to cost Yang a match versus Gregory Helms. After that match, Matt Hardy came out to help Yang ward off Helms and Sylvan. The following week, Hardy and Yang defeated Helms and Sylvan, ending Sylvan's feud with Yang.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} opens with two FBI detectives (played by Eric Roberts and Clarence Williams III) {{on the hunt}} for two diamond thieves (Ja Rule and Charli). It then cuts to Ja Rule and Charli ready to steal a diamond in a mansion at night (with Ja Rule rapping outside a car {{in-between}} scenes). They successfully found the diamonds hidden in the portrait. The owners, an actual married couple, were awakened by the alarm knowing that the hidden diamonds were stolen. The husband then pressed the alert button, calling the police. Ja Rule was able to escape, while his partner, Charli was arrested by the police. The scene then cuts to Charli's interrogation where the elder detective furiously asks the whereabouts of Ja Rule while another detective reveals the crime scene as well as Charli being the one who pulled the crime with Ja assisting her. He then asks where Ja is, along with the elder detective asking in a more furious manner. Charli replies that she doesn't know what they're talking about. In the next verse, Charli, still in the interrogation room raps {{in front of the}} two detectives which then shifts to her in prison. Charli, then makes a phone call to Ja Rule, who is at his own home and replies to her by rapping and singing the next verse. Charli is then released from prison and rides a limo to the airport where she meets Ja Rule in an airplane. It then shifts to the two celebrating Charli's release from prison in a beach. The two were then spotted by the detectives (via binoculars) in the same beach, who were also in <b>vacation.</b> The music <b>video</b> ends with the detectives laughing, complimenting and telling each other that [...] "you are the man" [...] with the white detective saying [...] "I love my job" [...] just as they are about to approach Ja and Charli as the music video for Down 4 U starts.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2013, three Al Jazeera English journalists Peter Greste, Mohamed Fahmy, and Baher Mohamed {{were arrested}} in their hotel rooms in a Cairo Marriott arrested on charges of {{delivering}} [...] "false news" [...] and [...] "aiding a terrorist organization" [...] by being part of Al Jazeera Media Network in Egypt following the 2013 Egyptian coup d'état and the shutdown in Egypt of Al Jazeera Mubasher Misr. The crew has had court trials that have been adjourned over 10 times where questionable evidence including video from other news organizations claimed to be from Al Jazeera English, inaudible audio recordings, pictures from a family <b>vacation,</b> a music <b>video</b> and video of sheep had been presented as evidence. The trial has been called out by free press groups and rights groups as a sham. The former Cairo Bureau chief from Al Jazeera English now works for sister channel AJ+ after the shutdown of the bureau. During the detainment of the journalists Al Jazeera along with the BBC and other major news organizations launched the Twitter and social media campaign #FreeAJStaff. The campaign included moments of silence while holding the hashtag as well as protesting at Egyptian embassies in various countries among other things. Calls from the United Nations, European Union and the United States for the journalists to be released were ignored. On 23 June 2014, the three journalists were found guilty by an Egyptian court. Greste and Fahmy were sentenced to 7 years in prison while Mohamed was sentenced to 10 years. The ruling was denounced by fellow journalists, including some at BBC, CNN, ABC Australia and most other major news outlets along with world leaders from Australia, Canada, The United States, United Nations, Switzerland and the United Kingdom primarily because they were found guilty based on no actual evidence {{in a case that}} has been deemed politically motivated and also because the ruling was seen as an attack on press freedom. The response was especially negative on the part of United States Secretary of State John Kerry who a day earlier was in Egypt and was made a promise of press freedom by Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi. The ruling has resulted in many negative stories in print, online and on television by various news outlets around the world calling the Egyptian justice system a kangaroo court and calling the Egyptian government authoritarian. There were various calls for amnesty, clemancy and pardons by various governments and news agencies all of which were declined by the Egyptian government who claimed that their justice system was independent and to respect the courts decision and stay out of Egyptian affairs. There are also calls for the United States to end or hold funding for the Egyptian military in response to the case. Attempts to free the journalists are still ongoing. Peter Greste was released from prison and deported back to Australia on 1 February 2015. On 29 August 2015, Fahmy, Greste and Mohamed were sentenced to 3 years in prison in a decision heavily criticized internationally. The Government of Canada worked to have Fahmy pardoned and deported. On 23 September 2015, Fahmy and Mohamed were pardoned by Egyptian president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi along with 100 other people and released from prison.|$|R
