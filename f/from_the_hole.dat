5|$|Bronchial {{injuries}} {{are divided into}} those that are accompanied by a disruption of the pleura {{and those that are}} not; in the former, air can leak <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> in the airway and a pneumothorax can form. The latter type is associated with more minor signs; pneumothorax is small if it occurs at all, and although function is lost in the part of the lung supplied by the injured bronchus, unaffected parts of the lungs may be able to compensate.|$|E

The investigation {{ground to a halt}} after a ruling by a U.S. District Court judge in a case concerning Marc and Claire Headley's complaints against the Church over their treatment at Gold Base.|$|E
5|$|Krohn's {{analysis}} of the production of Psycho in his book Hitchcock at Work, while refuting Bass' claims for directing the scene, notes that these storyboards did introduce key aspects of the final scene—most notably, {{the fact that the}} killer appears as a silhouette, and details such as the close-ups of the slashing knife, Leigh's desperate outstretched arm, the shower curtain being torn down, and the transition <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole</b> of the drainage pipe to Marion Crane's dead eyes. Krohn notes that this final transition is highly reminiscent of the iris titles that Bass created for Vertigo.|$|E

5|$|On the July 4, 2008 {{episode of}} SmackDown, Edge took his frustrations out on Vickie because {{he lost the}} title and told her the wedding was off. The {{following}} week, however, after Guerrero saved Edge from a con-chair-to by The Big Show, Edge re-proposed, and the wedding was back on. On July 18, 2008 at the wedding reception, Triple H came out and showed a video of Edge cheating on Guerrero the day before with the wedding planner, Alicia Fox. The angle continued at The Great American Bash in July, when Fox attempted to hand Edge the WWE Championship belt {{to use as a}} weapon against Triple H, but was stopped by Guerrero. Edge attempted to spear Triple H but hit Guerrero instead, with the distraction, Triple H performed a Pedigree on Edge to retain the WWE title. Edge attempted to apologize to Guerrero, even though he was seen talking to Fox, but she revealed to him that she had rehired The Undertaker and that Edge would face him in a Hell in a Cell match at SummerSlam. Edge then turned on La Familia during the August 8 episode of SmackDown, performing a one-man con-chair-to on Chavo in the ring, and tossed Guerrero out of her wheelchair, effectively disbanding the faction. The following week, Edge verbally assaulted Guerrero, before he forced her to apologize to The Undertaker for what she did to him. He also mentioned to Guerrero, that it was because of her that La Familia suffered. At SummerSlam, The Undertaker defeated Edge, and after the match, Undertaker chokeslammed Edge off the top of a ladder and through the ring canvas, with flames rising <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{edge of the}} bit has a {{sharpened}} spur to cut {{the fibers}} of the wood, as in the lip and spur drill bit. A radial cutting edge planes the wood {{from the base of}} the hole. In this version, there is minimal or no spiral to remove chips <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> The bit must be periodically withdrawn to clear the chips.|$|E
25|$|The {{center of}} the bit is a tapered screw thread. This screws into the wood as the bit is turned, and pulls the bit into the wood. There {{is no need for}} any force to push the bit into the workpiece, only the torque to turn the bit. This is ideal for a bit for a hand tool. The radial cutting edges remove a slice of wood of {{thickness}} equal to the pitch of the central screw for each rotation of the bit. To pull the bit <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> either the female thread in the wood workpiece must be stripped, or the rotation of the bit must be reversed.|$|E

25|$|The bit {{includes}} a center point which guides {{it throughout the}} cut (and incidentally spoils the otherwise flat bottom of the hole). The cylindrical cutter around the perimeter shears the wood fibers {{at the edge of}} the bore, and also helps guide the bit into the material more precisely. The tool in the image has a total of two cutting edges in this cylinder. Forstner bits have radial cutting edges to plane off the material at the bottom of the hole. The bit in the image has two radial edges. Other designs may have more. Forstner bits have no mechanism to clear chips <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> and therefore must be pulled out periodically.|$|E
25|$|Echidnas {{are very}} timid animals. When they feel {{endangered}} {{they attempt to}} bury themselves or if exposed they will curl into a ball, both methods using their spines to shield them. Strong front arms allow echidnas to continue to dig themselves in whilst holding fast against a predator attempting to remove them <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole.</b> Although they {{have a way to}} protect themselves, the echidnas still face many dangers. Some predators include wild cats, foxes, domestic dogs and goannas. Snakes pose as a large threat to the echidna species because they slither into their burrows and prey on the young spineless puggles. Some precautions that can be taken include keeping the environment clean by picking up litter and causing less pollution, planting vegetation for echidnas to use as shelter, supervising pets, reporting hurt echidnas or just leaving them undisturbed. Merely grabbing them may cause stress, and picking them up improperly may even result in injury.|$|E
25|$|The trapper who has {{located a}} cricket must catch and contain the insect without causing it any injuries. Present-day trappers use zhao, a soft {{catching}} net {{on a wire}} frame, to contain the cricket on the ground. The captured crickets are then placed into a clay pot and stay there until being sold; they are fed a few boiled rice grains per day. Earlier, the Chinese used cage-like traps made of bamboo or ivory rods. Pavel Piassetsky, who visited Beijing in the 1880s, described a different technique. The Beijing people used two kind of tools: a bell-like bowl {{with a hole in}} its bottom, and a tube several inches long. When a cricket was forced to leave its hideout, the trapper would quickly cover it with the bell. When the trapped cricket emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> the trapper would present the tube, and the cricket would eagerly hide inside it. The plugged tube then became a convenient cricket cage.|$|E

50|$|Besides {{sequential}} uncovering, recorders can use forked fingering {{to produce}} tones {{other than those}} produced by simple sequential lifting of fingers. In the fingering 0123, air leaks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> open <b>holes</b> 4,5,6, and 7. The pressure inside the bore is higher at <b>the</b> fourth <b>hole</b> than at <b>the</b> fifth, and decreases further at the 6th and 7th <b>holes.</b> Consequently, <b>the</b> most air leaks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> fourth <b>hole</b> and <b>the</b> least air leaks <b>from</b> <b>the</b> seventh <b>hole.</b> As a result, covering <b>the</b> fourth <b>hole</b> affects <b>the</b> pitch more than covering any of <b>the</b> <b>holes</b> below it. Thus, at the same air pressure, 01235 produces a pitch between 0123 and 01234 may be obtained. In this way, the fingers {{may be used to}} obtain fine gradations in pitch.|$|R

25|$|Woods {{made his}} next {{appearance}} at the Dubai Desert Classic, an event he had previously won twice and always ended inside the top five, in six previous appearances. Woods, ranked #3 in the world, was grouped with #1 Lee Westwood and #2 Martin Kaymer {{for the first two}} rounds. Woods started with 71 and scored 6-under 66 in round two to move into contention, and stayed in the hunt with 72 for round three, but struggled on Sunday with 75, to end in a tie for 20th, at 4-under 284, seven shots back of winner Álvaro Quirós. During the final round of that competition, Woods spat on the ground a few feet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hole,</b> after missing a putt at the 12th green. The incident was shown on televised coverage worldwide. Woods apologized for the incident in which he breached the European Tour's code of conduct; he will be fined an undisclosed sum. Later starters had to play across the area where Woods spat. Sportswriter John Feinstein stated on Golf Channel {{a few days after the}} incident that Woods is in fact the most-fined player in the history of the PGA Tour.|$|E
