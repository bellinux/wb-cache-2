40|$|I’d like {{to thank}} you all <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>today.</b> Let me start by sharing some {{information}} about today’s format. Each caller will have three minutes to make their comments. We will notify you when you have 30 seconds left in your comment period, so please at that point wrap up your other comments to allow other speakers an opportunity to be heard. Panelists will not be answering questions or responding to statements today that are voiced during this comment period. So please keep your comments professional, succinct and relevant to today’s topic. This session is being recorded and it will be available for playback at a later date and with that we look forward to the input and participation of everyone who is registered. At this point, I am going to turn it over to Jim Williams. Jim Williams, Manager, FAA UAS Integration Office: Good afternoon or good morning to everyone. Thank you, John, and let me add my welcome to those of you on the line who are participating in this listening session. I would like to provide you with some background information and go over ground rules for how the session will work. But first, I will take a minute to provide a quick introduction to unmanned aircraft systems.

40|$|Today’s {{hearing is}} the first in a two-part series that will examine the issues {{surrounding}} the treatment of migrants by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And the first of the series, this hearing today, we will have two panels, which will primarily focus on the issue of detention. I would like to begin by thanking our witnesses: Mr. John Torres, Mr. Richard Seiter, Ms. Michelle Brane´, Ms. Christina Fiflis, and Mr. Michael Cutler. And thank you <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>today</b> to discuss these important issues. With the end of the ‘‘catch and release’’ program, the Department of Homeland Security faces a daunting challenge: how to deal with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of migrants that have been detained in recent enforcement actions. But the challenge is not only for law enforcement. It is also a humanitarian challenge. Our goal must not only be to detain migrants, but also to make sure that their detention is humane. And at the same time, we must explore alternatives to detention that meet our law enforcement goals and that may provide more humane conditions for these detainees. Recently, reports have signaled that detention conditions and the treatment of detainees in administrative immigration detection have not been acceptable. I have found these reports very disturbing, and so have many of my colleagues. And I hope that this hearing will shed some light on the situation and lead to action points by which we can improve the conditions of these detainees. And I am particularly interested in learning more about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement standards for care and custody of these detainees. These standards need to include a guarantee for detainees to be treated humanely and, of course, to have access to counsel. It is also critical that the subcommittee {{gain a better understanding of}} how ICE and their detention contractors work together to meet these minimum standards. In addition, I am looking forward to hearing about alternatives to detention that can appropriately monitor individuals but ensure that they show up to all the necessary hearings. As a nation, we must be committed to treating detainees appropriately, with respect for their dignity as fellow human beings and in accordance with our laws, our traditions, and, quite frankly, the idea of this great country. Recent reports indicate that we have some work to do before we achieve all of this, and I hope this hearing gives us some sense of the progress that we have made on these issues...|$|E

40|$|Welcome to {{the inaugural}} issue of Rejecta Mathematica! Thank you <b>for</b> <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>for</b> {{what we hope}} will be a unique and {{interesting}} experiment. For those unfamiliar with our mission, Rejecta Mathematica is an open access, online journal that publishes only papers that have been rejected from peer-reviewed journals in the mathematical sciences. In addition, every paper appearing in Rejecta Mathematica includes an open letter from its authors discussing the paper’s original review process, disclosing any known flaws in the paper, and stating {{the case for the}} paper’s value to the community. Since starting this endeavor, the questions we’ve been asked most often are “Why are you doing this? ” and “Is it a joke? ” While we are not above admitting that we have had a few good laughs in this process, we hope that this issue will serve as definitive proof that Rejecta Mathematica is not a joke. Despite the central role that peer review (and even rejection) must play in the scientific process [1], we believe there are several reasons why this project can make a positive and valuable contribution to the mathematical sciences research community. First, there is ample evidence that in the traditional review process, significant (eve...|$|R

This {{year you}} will hear diverse talks from the HCIL’s faculty, staff, and {{students}} on cutting-edge research which focus on three important areas of HCI work: collaboration, search, and visual interfaces. In addition, new this year, we will also be previewing five HCI books that have been either authored or edited {{in the past year}} by our lab’s faculty. Following these talks, we will continue the long-standing tradition of welcoming you to our lab for demos and posters (and of course birthday cake) ! We hope you will be staying the next day as well, May 29, 2009, to enjoy a wide variety of tutorials and workshops topics that range from usability testing, to designing for people who learn differently. The Human-Computer Interaction lab has a long, rich history of transforming the experience people have with new technologies. From understanding user needs, to developing and evaluating those innovative technologies, the lab’s faculty, staff, and students have been leading the way in HCI research and teaching. We believe it is critical to understand how the needs and dreams of people can be reflected in our future technologies. To this end, the HCIL develops advanced user interfaces and design methodology. Our primary activities include collaborative research, publications, and the sponsorship of open houses, workshops and symposiums...|$|R

Our journal has turned 5 {{years old with}} this issue. We are {{extremely}} delighted and proud to see the seeds we planted {{in the autumn of}} 2010 take root and grow. Social studies as a system of scientific research, and an academic career, is relatively new to Turkey, so achieving this success here means even more compared to in other countries with more deeply rooted traditions and a greater accumulation of knowledge in this area. Therefore I am grateful to everyone who contributed to achieving this success over the last four years. JSSER {{is a member of the}} Association for Social Studies Educators (ASSE). From ASSE’s perspective JSSER‘s role is to provide a basis for social studies academicians to fulfill their national and wider responsibilities and mission by contributing to the advancement of the social science research and to the sharing of research results. The second contribution of the JSSER in this area was to set up and institutionalize an International Symposium on Social Studies Education. Last month we held the third such symposium. Every year we bring together hundreds of native and foreign scientists, teachers and students in these symposiums, which have gained the status of a scientific banquet. Among our medium term targets is the advancement of these two activities in quality and quantity...|$|R
40|$|The Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon John Howard MP, today officially {{opened the}} Sydney Campus of The University of Notre Dame Australia, amid the {{presence}} of distinguished guests, including the Cardinal Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal George Pell. The Sydney Campus of Notre Dame opened its doors this week to 450 foundation students, studying in six Schools: Arts and Sciences, Business, Education, Law, Nursing, and Philosophy and Theology. Notre Dame, a private Catholic university, {{has been established in}} Western Australia for 15 years, and its move to the east coast, at the invitation of Cardinal Pell, reflects the importance of an enhanced Catholic higher education presence, starting in Sydney. Notre Dame Australia Vice Chancellor, Dr Peter Tannock, says the University owes a debt of gratitude to both the Prime Minister and Cardinal Pell for their support and encouragement of this venture. ‘We are delighted that the Prime Minister and also the former Minister of Education, the Hon Dr Brendan Nelson MP, have graciously <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>today.</b> ‘Cardinal Pell’s vision for the rejuvenation of St Benedict’s and also Sacred Heart Parish at Darlinghurst, has enabled Notre Dame to establish itself in Sydney. ‘The Broadway Campus is centrally located on the historic St Benedict’s site. The University has magnificently restored and transformed two former schools and parish buildings into a splendid campus of higher education. ‘An important aspect of the new Campus is St Benedict’s Church, which has been restored to its rightful position and a significant Sydney landmark. ‘Notre Dame will make a substantial contribution to the diversity and quality of higher education in Sydney. ‘We aim to replicate the beauty of the Broadway campus on the Darlinghurst site, where it is proposed to open a Medical School in 2008. ‘Both Campuses will see the revival of these places of historical significance to the church and community of Sydney,’ Dr Tannock said. ‘I am grateful to the foundation students and their families who have placed trust in Notre Dame. Our dedicated staff, under the leadership of Peter Glasson, Executive Director and Professor George Kailis, Assistant Provost, will confirm the important choice they have made. ‘I also wish to acknowledge the Parish Priest of St Benedict’s, Fr John Neill op and his parishioners, whose co-operation and support has facilitated the successful restoration of St Benedict’s Church,’ Dr Tannock said...|$|R
