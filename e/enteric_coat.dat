40|$|ABSTRACT − The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a stable enteric coated {{diclofenac}} sodium (DFS) tablets using Aqua-Polish E without using a subcoat. DFS uncoated tablets were manufactured through the non direct compression process. AquaPolish E white aqueous coating dispersion was used as enteric coating material. This film forming polymer is a mixture of selected polymethacrylic/ethylacrylate copolymers. The stability of the obtained enteric coated tablets was evaluated according to ICH guidelines. No signs of disintegration or cracking was observed when they placed in 0. 1 N HCl solution (pH 1. 2), but they were completely disintegrated within 10 minutes when they placed in buffered solution at pH 6. 8. Dis-solution test was also conducted by placing tablets in 0. 1 N HCl for 2 hours and then 1 hour in phosphate buffer at pH 6. 8. Less than 0. 9 % of drug was released in the acidic phase and up to 97 % in the basic medium. These findings suggest that aqueous enteric coating with AquaPolish E system is an easy and economical approach for preparing stable DFS <b>enteric</b> <b>coat</b> without the use of a subcoating layer.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to apply artificial neural networks (ANNs) to examine {{the relative importance of}} various factors, both formulation and process, governing the in-vitro dissolution from enteric-coated sustained release (SR) minitablets. Input feature selection (IFS) algorithms were used in order to give an estimate of the relative importance of the various formulation and processing variables in determining minitablet dissolution rate. Both forward and backward stepwise algorithms were used as well as genetic algorithms. Networks were subsequently trained using the back propagation algorithm in order to check whether or not the IFS process had correctly located any unimportant inputs. IFS gave consistent rankings for the importance of the various formulation and processing variables in determining the release of drug from minitablets. Consistent ranking was achieved for both indices of the release process; ie, the time taken for release to commence through the <b>enteric</b> <b>coat</b> (Tlag) and that for the drug to diffuse through the SR matrix of the minitablet into the dissolution medium (T 90 - 10). In the case of the Tlag phase, the main coating parameters, along with the original batch blend size and the blend time with lubricant, were found to have most influence. By contrast, with the T 90 - 10 phase, the amounts of matrix forming polymer and direct compression filler were most important. In the subsequent training of the ANNs, removal of inputs regarded as less important led to improved network performance. ANNs were capable of ranking the relative importance of the various formulations and processing variables that influenced the release rate of the drug from minitablets. This could be done for all main stages of the release process.

A 260 cm long multilumen tube {{was used for}} double marker perfusion of two 20 cm segments located in the duodenum and in the ileum respectively. Luminal pH, flow, and trypsin and lipase activity outputs were measured at each segment for four hours postcibally. Placebo treated patients with pancreatic steatorrhoea had low enzyme outputs in the duodenal test segment and even lower outputs in the ileal segment. Pancreatin treatment significantly decreased steatorrhoea (p < 0. 05) and increased luminal enzyme outputs (p < 0. 05). The increase was much greater in the ileal than in the duodenal segment. Thus <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> pancreatin treatment abolished the normal gradient between postcibal duodenal and ileal lipase output. The results suggest that <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> pancreatin nearly corrects severe pancreatic steatorrhoea. The ingested lipase was utilised inefficiently, however, as luminal enzyme activity in the ileum was enhanced {{to a greater extent}} than in the duodenum, and consequently the absorptive potential of the small bowel was only partially utilised...|$|R
40|$|Background: Poor drug {{quality is}} a matter of serious concern, {{especially}} in countries where drug regulation and law enforcement are constrained by limited resources. This study was carried out to investigate the cause of quality failure of omeprazole in Cambodia in 2010 and Myanmar in 2014. Methods: We conducted pharmacopoeial quantity, content uniformity and dissolution tests of 156 samples of omeprazole capsules collected in Cambodia in 2010 and Myanmar in 2014. High failure rates were found, especially in dissolution testing, and detailed investigation of several unacceptable samples was carried out by means of in-vitro dissolution profiling, scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and X-ray computed tomography (X-ray CT) to identify the cause of failure. Results: Dissolution profiling with and without the acid stage showed that acid caused premature omeprazole release, indicating that the <b>enteric</b> <b>coating</b> of the omeprazole granules was ineffective. SEM examination of two failed samples revealed cracked and broken granules mixed with apparently intact omeprazole granules in the capsule. X-ray CT examination indicated that some granules of failed samples completely lacked <b>enteric</b> <b>coating,</b> and others had incomplete and non-uniform <b>enteric</b> <b>coating</b> or malformation. Conclusions: Omeprazole capsules collected in Myanmar and Cambodia showed high failure rates in pharmacopoeial tests, especially dissolution tests. Some samples were found to have ineffective or absent <b>enteric</b> <b>coating</b> of the granules, resulting in premature dissolution and degradation in acidic conditions. This is a potentially serious public health issue {{that needs to be addressed}} by regulatory authorities in Cambodia and Myanmar, possibly through a collaborative initiative with manufacturers. © 2017 The Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Controlled and {{localized}} {{release of}} drugs in the intestine {{can be achieved by}} <b>enteric</b> <b>coating.</b> The design of enteric-coated tablets has so far remained empirical, {{in part because of the}} lack of a quantitative description of the drug release kinetics. In this paper, a mathematical model is presented that describes the dissolution of the polymer coating and release kinetics of weakly acidic drugs from enteric-coated tablets in buffered media. This model can also be used to predict the time of onset of core disintegration. The model assumes that the release rate is limited by diffusion, and furthermore, all the reactions are considered as reversible and instantaneous. Dissolution and reaction are assumed to take place in the polymer layer and a hypothetical stagnant liquid film adjacent to the polymer layer (the classical film theory approach). The dissolution of the <b>enteric</b> <b>coating</b> is found to depend on the intrinsic solubilities and p K a 's of the drug and polymer and the medium properties. The release rate of the drug is found to depend on the intrinsic solubilities and p K a 's of drug and polymer, the medium properties, i. e., pH and buffer capacity, and a mass transfer coefficient. Explicit relationships between the release rates and all these factors are derived. Successful prediction of experimental data indicates that the model provides an adequate description of release from <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> tablets. Limitations of the model and its potential application to the design of appropriate in vitro testing conditions and to the formulation of <b>enteric</b> <b>coated</b> tablets are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|In {{an effort}} to reduce {{production}} costs, a simple, direct compression delayed release formulation consisting of pantoprazole was investigated. Pantoprazole is a proton pump inhibitor belongs to group of benzimidazole. It is very efficient for the treatment of gastric and duodenum ulcers. Even in solid state pantoprazole is sensitive to heat, humidity, light and especially to substances containing an acidic group. For such types of drugs, <b>enteric</b> <b>coating</b> added to the formulation tends to avoid the stomach's acidic exposure, delivering them instead to a basic pH environment where they do not degrade, and give their desired action. Subcoating is desirable to protect the <b>enteric</b> <b>coating.</b> Opadry and Acryl-EZE systems have been utilized for subcoating and <b>enteric</b> <b>coating</b> respectively. Delayed-release tablets with good physical, mechanical and technological properties were obtained with use of different combinations of diluents, binders, superdisintegrants and lubricants. A comparative kinetic study of the present tablets and commercial tablets was established. The value for the similarity factor (f 2 = 71. 6) suggested that the dissolution profile of the present two delayed-release oral dosage forms are similar. Hixon–Crowell (erosion) kinetic profiles were achieved...|$|R
