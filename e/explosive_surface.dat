40|$|This paper {{describes}} a probabilistic analysis {{of an unusual}} safety concern encountered during safety analysis of a closed system containing high explosive (HE). In this application, a pyrophoric material could be generated inside the system by corrosion of system components. This pyrophoric may form extremely small particles that could be transported through a complex path to a high explosive component where they could collect on exposed surfaces {{as a result of}} routine handling operations. A potentially serious accident could be initiated if the system is opened for maintenance and oxygen reaches the pyrophoric particles that are resting {{on the surface of the}} high explosive. The pyrophoric particles react vigorously in the presence of oxygen and will ignite the high explosive if there is a sufficient concentration of the particles in a localized area. This paper reports on models for estimating the probability of achieving hazardous concentrations of pyrophoric particles on the <b>explosive</b> <b>surface.</b> These probability estimates are based on occupancy likelihood and geometric models. The probability models provide a means for exploring the effects of material behavior, heat transfer, and material transport on the likelihood of achieving unwanted concentrations of pyrophoric particles on the <b>explosive</b> <b>surface...</b>|$|E
40|$|Even {{a single}} excess {{electron}} or ion migrating {{on the surface}} of sensitive explosives can catalyze their gradual exothermic decomposition. Mechanisms underlying such a charge-induced gradual thermal decomposition of highly sensitive explosives can be different. If sensitive explosive is a polar liquid, intense charge-dipole attraction between excess surface charges and surrounding explosive molecules can result in repetitive attempts of solvation of these charges by polar explosive molecules. Every attempt of such uncompleted nonequilibrium solvation causes local exothermic decomposition of thermolabile polar molecules accompanied by further thermal jumping unsolvated excess charges to new surface sites. Thus, ionized mobile hot spots emerge on charged <b>explosive</b> <b>surface.</b> Stochastic migration of ionized hot spots on <b>explosive</b> <b>surface</b> causes gradual exothermic decomposition of the whole mass of the polar explosive. The similar gradual charge-catalyzed exothermic decomposition of both polar and nonpolar highly sensitive explosives can be also caused by intense charge-dipole attacks of surrounding water vapor molecules electrostatically attracted from ambient humid air and strongly accelerated towards charged sites on explosive surfaces. Emission of electrons, photons and heat from ionized hot spots randomly migrating on charged surface of highly sensitive explosive aerosol nanoparticles converts such particles into the form of short-circuited thermionic nanobatteries.

30|$|Hydrothermal {{systems are}} {{relevant}} {{to a variety of}} hydrovolcanic phenomena, including hydrovolcanic eruptions (Barberi et al. 1992; Germanovich and Lowell 1995; Browne and Lawless 2001). In this study, we focus on phreatic eruptions, defined by Barberi et al. (1992), as the eruption style caused by underground aquifers, {{whether or not they are}} phreatic or geothermal, without direct involvement of a magma body. Although most phreatic eruptions are local phenomena affecting a limited area, they can be accompanied by hazards such as ballistic blocks, base surges, and debris avalanches, and precursors are often subtle (Barberi et al. 1992). Germanovich and Lowell (1995) suggested a typical sequence of processes for phreatic eruptions: (1) dike injection, (2) hydrothermal system heating above the dike, and (3) rapid crack propagation due to thermal stress. This implies that the hydrothermal system may experience some change in state prior to phreatic eruptions. However, changes in the hydrothermal system do not always lead to <b>explosive</b> <b>surface</b> manifestations. Thus, improved understanding of changes in state in the hydrothermal system contributes to the assessment of whether phreatic eruption is likely.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} assess the {{possibility}} to follow surface reactions in a quantitative way by vibrational spectroscopy, a combination of temperature programmed reaction spectroscopy (TPRS) and reflection absorption infrared spectroscopy (RAIRS) {{has been used to}} study the decomposition of NO and the reaction between NO and CO on Rh(100). NO adsorbs in two configurations: in an almost parallel position at coverages below 0. 18 ML and, in addition, in an upright position, probably on a bridge site, at all coverages. Coadsorbing NO and CO has only a minor influence on NO binding, whereas CO shifts gradually from top toward the bridge site under the influence of NO. Combining TP-RAIRS with TPRS during the reaction between CO and NO enabled us to simultaneously study site occupation and obtain qualitative surface coverages and desorption rates. At low surface coverages, NO dissociation is observed at lower temperatures than CO 2 formation. Near saturation, NO dissociation becomes blocked and shifts up in temperature. NO dissociation occurs simultaneously with CO 2 formation. To decompose NO, free surface sites have to be generated through surface diffusion or desorption of some CO. During NO decomposition, the formed oxygen atoms react with CO to form CO 2, creating more empty sites. This may lead to an <b>explosive</b> <b>surface</b> reaction...|$|E
40|$|Aquistore {{is a deep}} saline CO 2 storage {{research}} and demonstration project located near Estevan, Saskatchewan where CO 2 is transported via pipeline and injected into a sandstone reservoir ∼ 3200 m below the surface. A pre-injection time-lapse analysis performed on two sparse 3 D seismic datasets was used to characterise the background time-lapse signal-to-noise level at the storage site. The time-lapse analysis revealed that the lowest global nRMS was 0. 07 which was taken to represent the level above which CO 2 would be detectable in the reservoir. We investigate {{the conditions under which}} the injected CO 2 can be detected above the defined minimum noise level through Gassmann fluid substitution and 3 D seismic forward modelling. Additionally, Wave Unix was used to simulate the seismic response of the reservoir due to the injected CO 2 by generating the synthetic surface reflection seismic data from an <b>explosive</b> <b>surface</b> P-wave source. We generated noise-free synthetic seismograms for the baseline model {{as well as for the}} 2 -phase fluid replacement of brine with CO 2 for CO 2 concentrations up to 100 % within the target zone – the monitors. The baseline and monitor traces from the 3 D seismic survey at Aquistore are used as the noise traces in this study, and were added to their respective baseline and monitor synthetic traces. The nRMS within the reservoir was then computed for the noisy baseline and various noisy monitor surveys and was used in the assessment of the limitation to the detection of the injected CO 2 in the reservoir under the background noise level at the site. We are able to conclude that the time-lapse repeatability will not limit the ability to monitor the CO 2 induced changes in the reservoir at the Aquistore storage site...|$|E
40|$|We assess bias in {{the record}} of {{kimberlite}} volcanism by using newly acquired size data on more than 900 kimberlite bodies from 12 kimberlite fields eroded to depths of between 0 m and > 1200 m, and by a comparison with intraplate monogenetic basaltic volcanic fields. Eroded kimberlite fields are composed of pipes (or diatremes) and dikes, and within any one kimberlite field, regardless of erosion level, kimberlite bodies vary in area at Earth’s surface over 2 – 3 orders of magnitude. Typically 60 %– 70 % of the bodies are < 10 % {{the area of the}} largest pipe in the field. The maximum size of a kimberlite pipe found in a field shows a relationship with estimated erosion levels, suggesting that the erosion level of a region could be used to predict the maximum potential size of a pipe where it intersects the surface. The data indicate that the selective removal of surface volcanic structures and deposits by erosion has distorted the geological record of kimberlite volcanism. Selective mining of preferentially large, diamondiferous kimberlite pipes and underreporting of small kimberlite pipes and dikes add further bias. A comparison of kimberlite volcanic fields with intraplate monogenetic basaltic volcanic fields indicates that both types of volcanism overlap in terms of field size, volcano number and size, and typical erupted volumes. Eroded monogenetic basaltic fields consist of dikes that fed effusive and weakly <b>explosive</b> <b>surface</b> eruptions, and diatremes (pipes) generated during phreatomagmatic eruptions, and they are structurally similar to eroded kimberlite fields. Reassessment of published data suggests that kimberlite magmas can erupt {{in a variety of ways}} and that most published data, taken from the largest kimberlite pipes, may not be representative of kimberlite volcanism as a whole. This refuels long-standing debates as to whether kimberlite pipes (diatremes) primarily result from phreatomagmatic eruptions (as in basaltic volcanism) or from volatile-driven magmatic eruptions...|$|E

Trace amounts adhere to the hands and equipment of those handling explosives and are subsequently transferred to clothing, parcels, vehicles, or other surfaces. Improved methods to remove detectable amounts of these <b>explosives</b> from <b>surfaces</b> will allow more effective detection of explosives in a range of environments. ^ Current collection methods can be classified as either contact or non-contact.

In the standard tests, the driver is a column of low density powder of high explosive PETN, inserted coaxially into the bore of a smooth-walled cylinder and initiated by exploding a bundle of fine copper wires at the column axis using a discharge current from a high-voltage capacitor bank. Notched cylinders with single axial slit, various grooves in the walls, and smooth cylinders with varied wall thicknesses were tested. Low-carbon steels and an aluminum alloy A 5052 were provided in addition to the standard smooth-walled 304 stainless steel cylinder, and they were fully or partially charged with varying explosive column diameters. The initiated locations in the explosive column are changed for comparison, placing the bundle of fine copper wires eccentrically from the central axis or replacing the fine wire bundle into a bold wire line except the middle portion at the central axis for central point initiation.

40|$|We report new {{geophysical}} {{observations on}} the distribution of subsurface structures associated with monogenetic volcanism in the Garrotxa volcanic field (Northern Spain). As part of the Catalan Volcanic Zone, this Quaternary volcanic field is associated with the European rifts system. It contains the most recent and best preserved volcanic edifices of the Catalan Volcanic Zone with 38 monogenetic volcanoes identified in the Garrotxa Natural Park. We conducted new gravimetric and self-potential surveys to enhance our understanding {{of the relationship between the}} local geology and the spatial distribution of the monogenetic volcanoes. The main finding of this study is that the central part of the volcanic field is dominated by a broad negative Bouguer anomaly of around - 0. 5 mGal, within which a series of gravity minima are found with amplitudes of up to - 2. 3 mGal. Inverse modelling of the Bouguer data suggests that surficial low-density material dominates the volcanic field, most likely associated with effusive and <b>explosive</b> <b>surface</b> deposits. In contrast, an arcuate cluster of gravity minima to the NW of the Croscat volcano, the youngest volcano of this zone, is modelled by vertically extended low-density bodies, which we interpret as a complex ensemble of fault damage zones and the roots of young scoria cones. A ground-water infiltration zone identified by a self-potential anomaly is associated with a steep horizontal Bouguer gravity gradient and interpreted as a fault zone and/or magmatic fissure, which fed the most recent volcanic activity in the Garrotxa. Gravimetric and self-potential data are well correlated and indicate a control on the locations of scoria cones by NNE-SSW and NNW-SSE striking tectonic features, which intersect the main structural boundaries of the study area to the north and south. Our interpretation of the data is that faults facilitated magma ascent to the surface. Our findings have major implications for understanding the relationship between subsurface structures and potential future volcanic activity in the Garrotxa volcanic field.

Surface water represented three rivers {{with a range of}} total organic carbon concentrations and two rivers draining glacial watersheds with minimal organic carbon but high suspended solids. 18. 2 MX deionized water exhibited no explosives transformation. Nitroaromatic compound loss from solution was generally: tetryl > 1, 3, 5 -TNB > TNT > 1, 3 -DNB > 2, 4 -DNT. The HMX, RDX, 2, 6 -DNT, 2 ADNT, and 4 ADNT concentrations remained somewhat stable over time. The surface water with the highest total organic carbon concentration exhibited the most dramatic nitroaromatic loss from solution with tetryl, 1, 3, 5 -TNB and TNT concentrations decreasing to below detection within 10 d. The two water samples with high suspended solid loads exhibited substantial nitroaromatic explosives loss which could be attributable to adsorption onto fresh mineral surfaces and/or enhanced microbiologic biotransformation on mineral surfaces.

40|$|We {{report the}} results of Raman {{investigation}} performed at stand-off distance between 6 - 10 m with a new apparatus, capable to detect traces of <b>explosives</b> with <b>surface</b> concentrations {{similar to those of}} a single fingerprint. The device was developed as part of the RADEX prototype (RAman Detection of EXplosives) and is capable of detecting the Raman signal with a single laser shot of few ns (10 - 9 s) in the UV range (wavelength 266 nm), in conditions of safety for the human eye. This is because the maximum permissible exposure (MPE) for the human eye is established to be 3 mJ/cm 2 in this wavelength region and pulse duration. Samples of explosives (PETN, TNT, Urea Nitrate, Ammonium Nitrate) were prepared starting from solutions deposited on samples of common fabrics or clothing materials such as blue jeans, leather, polyester or polyamide. The deposition process takes place via a piezoelectric-controlled plotter device, capable of producing drops of welldefined volume, down to nanoliters, on a surface of several cm 2, in order to carefully control the amount of explosive released to the tissue and thus simulate a slight stain on a garment of a potential terrorist. Depending on the type of explosive sampled, the detected density ranges from 0. 1 to 1 mg/cm 2 and is comparable to the density measured in a spot on a dress or a bag due to the contact with hands contaminated with explosives, as it could happen in the preparation of an improvised explosive device (IED) by a terrorist. To our knowledge the developed device is at the highest detection limits nowadays achievable in the field of eyesafe, stand-off Raman instruments. The signals obtained show some vibrational bands of the Raman spectra of our samples with high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), allowing us to identify with high sensitivity (high number of True Positives) and selectivity (low number of False Positives) the explosives, so that the instrument could represent the basis for an automated and remote monitoring device...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{aimed to}} determine the neuromuscular response of the bicep brachii during heavy (6 RM) dynamic resistance exercise performed to volitional exhaustion. Electromyographic (EMG) activity was compared in twelve male subjects performing dominant-limb elbow flexion exercise during four conditions: i) Explosive concentric and eccentric (SSC); ii) Explosive concentric, control eccentric (EC); iii) control (C); and iv) control with limb occlusion (CO) (110 mmHg). CO and SSC are reported to increase motor unit activity when compared to control exercise (2 second flexion, 2 second extension). It was hypothesised that EMG activity will be higher in conditions of <b>explosive</b> exercise. <b>Surface</b> EMG activity was collected (Digitmer, Neurolog NL 844, NL 820) at 2 kHz and filtered using 500 Hz (low-pass) and 10 Hz (high-pass) filters (Digitimer, Neurolog NL 44, NL 135). Root mean square (RMS) significantly increased; SSC= 71. 0 ± 14. 9 % (P= 0. 004), EC= 52. 8 ± 10. 0 % (P= 0. 001), C= 44. 4 ± 11. 1 % (P= 0. 007), CO= 33. 9 ± 11. 1 % (P= 0. 025) and mean power frequency (MPF) significantly decreased; SSC= 36. 0 ± 4. 2 Hz (P= 0. 001), EC= 18. 0 ± 3. 8 Hz (P= 0. 002) C= 17. 9 ± 3. 4 Hz (P= 0. 001), CO= 20. 3 ± 3. 2 Hz (P= 0. 001) from the first to last repetition. The first repetition of SSC exercise displayed significantly higher MPF (17. 4 ± 4. 0 Hz, P= 0. 009) compared to C. RMS was significantly different in CO to SSC exercise (34. 9 ± 10. 5 %, P= 0. 048) at the final repetition. SSC exercise demonstrated the greatest EMG response to exhaustive heavy resistance exercise and is attributed {{to an increase in}} motor unit recruitment and discharge rate. The lack of an observed difference between the EC and C exercise suggests eccentric limb speed is important for concentric muscle activation...|$|R
40|$|The end-Permian {{extinction}} decimated up to 95 % of carbonate shell-bearing {{marine species}} and 80 % of land animals. Isotopic excursions, dissolution of shallow marine carbonates, and {{the demise of}} carbonate shell-bearing organisms suggest global warming and ocean acidification. The temporal association of the extinction with the Siberia flood basalts at approximately 250  Ma is well known, and recent evidence suggests these flood basalts may have mobilized carbon in thick deposits of organic-rich sediments. Large isotopic excursions recorded in this period are potentially explained by rapid venting of coal-derived methane, which has primarily been attributed to metamorphism of coal by basaltic intrusion. However, recently discovered contemporaneous deposits of fly ash in northern Canada suggest large-scale combustion of coal as an additional mechanism for rapid release of carbon. This massive coal combustion may have resulted from explosive interaction with basalt sills of the Siberian Traps. Here we present physical analysis of explosive eruption of coal and basalt, demonstrating {{that it is a}} viable mechanism for global extinction. We describe and constrain the physics of this process including necessary magnitudes of basaltic intrusion, mixing and mobilization of coal and basalt, ascent to the <b>surface,</b> <b>explosive</b> combustion, and the atmospheric rise necessary for global distribution...|$|R
40|$|Live-fire {{military}} training can deposit millimeter-sized particles of high <b>explosives</b> (HE) on <b>surface</b> soils when rounds do not explode as intended. Rainfall-driven {{dissolution of the}} particles then begins a process whereby aqueous HE solutions can enter the soil and groundwater as contaminants. We dripped water onto individual particles of TNT, Tritonal, Comp B and Octol to simulate how surface-deposited HE particles might dissolve under the action of rainfall {{and to use the}} data to verify a model that predicts HE dissolution as a function of particle size, particle composition and rainfall rate. Particle masses ranged from 1. 1 to 17 mg and drip rates corresponded to nominal rainfall rates of 6 and 12 mm h- 1. For the TNT and Tritonal particles, TNT solubility governed dissolution time scales, whereas the lower-solubility of RDX controlled the dissolution time of both RDX and TNT in Comp B. The large, low-solubility crystals of HMX slowed but did not control the dissolution of TNT in Octol. Predictions from a drop-impingement dissolution model agree well with dissolved-mass timeseries for TNT, Tritonal and Comp B, providing some confidence that the model will also work well when applied to the rainfall-driven, outdoor dissolution of these HE particles...|$|R
