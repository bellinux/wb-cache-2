5|$|A lattice gas {{automaton}} is {{a cellular}} automaton designed {{to simulate the}} motion of particles in a fluid or an ideal gas. In such a system, gas particles move on straight lines with constant velocity, until undergoing elastic collision with other particles. Lattice gas automata simplify these models by only allowing a constant number of velocities (typically, only one speed and either four or six <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> motion) and by simplifying the types of collision that are possible.|$|E

5|$|Adrian {{previously}} converted their downtown {{streets to}} one-way traffic between 1950 and 1973. The traffic pattern created an unusual arrangement in the routings {{of the two}} state highways downtown. Southbound M-52 followed Winter Street, which also carried both eastbound and westbound <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> the US223 business loop. These streets carried both highways around the downtown business district in this arrangement until November 2009.|$|E
5|$|An {{expert panel}} of {{engineers}} {{released a report}} outlining concerns regarding the decreased loop ramp radii {{and a lack of}} protective guardrail at sharp curves, in addition to the lack of a concrete median barrier to separate the opposite <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> travel. However, it was also argued that the large grass median was sufficient to prevent cross-over collisions, given that Highway410 has a similar median.|$|E
5|$|By then, {{work was}} already {{advanced}} on several projects, including the northbound HOV lane on Highway404 (that opened on July23, 2007) and an HOV lane along both <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> Highway403 between Highway407 and Highway401.

40|$|AbstractWhen {{subjects}} viewed {{straight and}} turned {{eyes that were}} isolated singly or in pairs from a head that was straight or turned, they underestimated their true <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> gaze. They also underestimated the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> head turn when both eyes were closed. However, the judged <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> gaze was improved when the eyes were layered against the heads. Judged <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> averted gaze was primarily based on the abducting eye. The effect that the deviation between an eye’s optical axis and its true <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> gaze (angle kappa) has on its judged <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> gaze is discussed...|$|R

5|$|However, not {{everyone}} {{was satisfied with}} the new liturgical and political <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> the AFM. Wessel's political ties led to the radicalization of younger black pastors, {{the loss of the}} majority of the English membership, and a major division of Afrikaner members who did not share his political views. These Afrikaners not only disagreed with Wessel politically but also with du Plessis liturgically. In 1958, they broke from the AFM and formed the Pentecostal Protestant Church.|$|E

5|$|Among Uranus's {{five major}} moons, Ariel {{is the second}} closest to the planet, {{orbiting}} at the distance of about 190,000km. Its orbit has a small eccentricity and is inclined very little relative to the equator of Uranus. Its orbital period is around 2.5Earth days, coincident with its rotational period. This means that {{one side of the}} moon always faces the planet; a condition known as tidal lock. Ariel's orbit lies completely inside the Uranian magnetosphere. The trailing hemispheres (those facing away from their <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> orbit) of airless satellites orbiting inside a magnetosphere like Ariel are struck by magnetospheric plasma co-rotating with the planet. This bombardment may lead to the darkening of the trailing hemispheres observed for all Uranian moons except Oberon (see below). Ariel also captures magnetospheric charged particles, producing a pronounced dip in energetic particle count near the moon's orbit observed by Voyager 2 in 1986.|$|E

The highway briefly parallels the Shafter Subdivision of the Union Pacific Railroad's Central Corridor, which was formerly part of the Feather River Route of the Western Pacific Railroad. As the highway travels east towards a half trumpet interchange with I-80, the number of lanes drops from five to two. Traffic from BL-80 can access eastbound I-80 or turn off onto Frontage Road; however, to access westbound I-80, travelers must continue eastbound until the next exit and turn around.
