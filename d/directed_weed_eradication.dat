40|$|There {{has been}} recent {{interest}} {{in determining the}} upper limits to the feasibility of <b>weed</b> <b>eradication.</b> Although a number of disparate factors determine the success of an eradication program, ultimately eradication feasibility must be viewed {{in the context of}} the amount of investment that can be made. The latter should reflect the hazard posed by an invasion, with greater investment justified by greater threats. In simplest terms, the effort (and hence investment) to achieve <b>weed</b> <b>eradication</b> comprises the detection effort required to delimit an invasion plus the search and control effort required to prevent reproduction until extirpation occurs over the entire infested area. The difficulty of estimating the required investment at the commencement of a <b>weed</b> <b>eradication</b> program (as well as during periodic reviews) is a serious problem. Bioeconomics show promise in determining the optimal approach to managing weed invasions, notwithstanding ongoing difficulties in estimating the costs and benefits of eradication and alternative invasion management strategies. A flexible approach to the management of weed invasions is needed, allowing for the adoption of another strategy when it becomes clear that the probability of eradication is low, owing to resourcing or intractable technical issues. Whether the considerable progress that has been achieved towards eradication of the once massive witchweed invasion can be duplicated for other weeds of agricultural systems will depend to a large extent upon investment (. $ 250 million over 50 yr in this instance). Weeds of natural ecosystems seem destined to remain more difficult eradication targets for a variety of reasons, including higher impedance to eradication, more difficulty in valuing the benefits arising from eradication, and possibly less willingness to pay from society at large...|$|R

40|$|<b>Weed</b> <b>eradication</b> {{programs}} {{often require}} 10 {{years or more}} to achieve their objective. It is important that progress is evaluated {{on a regular basis}} so that programs that are 'on track' can be distinguished from those that are unlikely to succeed. Earlier research has addressed conformity of eradication programs to the delimitation criterion. In this paper evaluation in relation to the containment and extirpation criteria is considered. Because strong evidence of containment failure (i. e. spread from infestations targeted for eradication) is difficult to obtain, it generally will not be practicable to evaluate how effective eradication programs are at containing the target species. However, chronic failure of containment will be reflected in sustained increases in cumulative infested area and thus a failure to delimit a weed invasion. Evaluating the degree of conformity to the delimitation and extirpation criteria is therefore sufficient to give an appraisal of progress towards the eradication objective. A significant step towards eradication occurs when a weed is no longer readily detectable at an infested site, signalling entry to the monitoring phase. This transition will occur more quickly if reproduction is prevented consistently. Where an invasion consists of multiple infestations, the monitoring profile (frequency distribution of time since detection) provides a summary of the overall effectiveness of the eradication program in meeting the extirpation criterion. Eradication is generally claimed when the target species has not been detected for a period equal to or greater than its seed longevity, although there is often considerable uncertainty in estimates of the latter. Recently developed methods, which take into consideration the cost of continued monitoring vs. the potential cost of damage should a weed escape owing to premature cessation of an eradication program, can assist managers to decide when to terminate <b>weed</b> <b>eradication</b> programs...|$|R

40|$|Summary Knowing {{the extent}} of a weed infesta-tion is {{required}} to justify a <b>weed</b> <b>eradication</b> program as this has a large influence on the benefit:cost ratio. Detecting weeds at low levels is difficult and expensive as large numbers of samples are required. For weeds that contaminate grain, many samples can be collected cheaply as the grain is delivered for sale and these can be screened for weed seed. Using image analysis al-lows large numbers of samples to be screened quickly. This paper describes a system where a video camera is set up over a conveyor belt and the images are analysed {{for the presence of}} three-horned bedstraw (Galium tricornutum) seed. The image analysis software is trained by passing contaminated grain through the system where 25 characteristics of suspect objects are recorded. Discriminant analysis is then used to develop a formula that distinguishes the three-horned bedstraw from similar looking objects. Grain to be screened is then passed through the machine. When a suspect seed is detected the grain is automatically diverted to a separate container. Grain from this container is then manually scanned or put through the machine again to further concentrate the sample...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Decision-making in weed {{management}} involves {{consideration of}} limited budgets, long time horizons, conflicting priorities, {{and as a}} result, trade-offs. Economics provides tools that allow these issues to be addressed and is thus integral to management of the risks posed by weeds. One of the critical issues in weed risk management {{during the early stages}} of an invasion concerns feasibility of eradication. We briefly review how economics may be used in weed risk management, concentrating on this management strategy. Location: Australia. Methods: A range of innovative studies that investigate aspects of weed risk management are reviewed. We show how these could be applied to newly invading weeds, focussing on methods for investigating eradication feasibility. In particular, eradication feasibility is analysed in terms of cost and duration of an eradication programme, using a simulation model based on field-derived parameter values for chromolaena, Chromolaena odorata. Results: The duration of an eradication programme can be reduced by investing in progressively higher amounts of search effort per hectare, but increasing search area will become relatively more expensive as search effort increases. When variation in survey and control success is taken into account, increasing search effort also reduces uncertainty around the required duration of the eradication programme. Main conclusions: Economics is integral to the management of the risks posed by weeds. Decision analysis, based on economic principles, is now commonly used to tackle key issues that confront <b>weed</b> managers. For <b>eradication</b> feasibility, duration and cost of a <b>weed</b> <b>eradication</b> programme are critical components; the dimensions of both factors can usefully be estimated through simulation. © 2013 John Wiley & Sons Ltd...|$|R

We found no negative relationships in terms of emergent diversity metrics and occupation of space, indeed, many positive relationships were revealed. When split by land-use, differences were found along the disturbance gradient. In high-moderately disturbed grasslands associated with land-uses such as cropping and modified pastures, positive associations were enhanced. Tolerance and facilitation mechanisms may be involved, such as complementary roles through different life history strategies: the exotic flora was dominated mainly by annual grasses and herbs whereas the native flora represented more diverse growth-forms with a higher proportion of perennials. The positive relationships existing between native and exotic plant species in high-moderately disturbed grasslands of South Australia are most likely due to facilitation through different strategies in occupation of space given that the effect of habitat suitability was controlled for by including environmental and disturbance factors.

R. M. King & H. Rob. (Siam weed) seeds at three different stages of maturity. After foliar application of fluroxypyr germination of mature seeds was reduced by 88 % and intermediate and immature seeds were reduced by 100 %, compared to the control. Fluroxypyr also reduced the viability of mature, intermediate and immature seeds by 79, 89 and 67 % respectively, compared to the control. Metsulfuron-methyl reduced germination of intermediate and immature seeds by 53 and 99 % respectively compared to the control. Viability was also reduced by 74 and 96 % respectively, compared to the control.

40|$|Two {{prerequisites}} for realistically embarking upon an eradication programme are that cost-benefit analysis favours this strategy over other management options and that sufficient resources {{are available to}} carry the programme through to completion. These are not independent criteria, but it is our view that too {{little attention has been}} paid to estimating the investment required to complete <b>weed</b> <b>eradication</b> programmes. We deal with this problem by using a two-pronged approach: 1) developing a stochastic dynamic model that provides an estimation of programme duration; and 2) estimating the inputs required to delimit a weed incursion and to prevent weed reproduction over a sufficiently long period to allow extirpation of all infestations. The model is built upon relationships that capture the time-related detection of new infested areas, rates of progression of infestations from the active to the monitoring stage, rates of reversion of infestations from the monitoring to active stage, and the frequency distribution of time since last detection for all infestations. This approach is applied to the branched broomrape (Orobanche ramosa) eradication programme currently underway in South Australia. This programme commenced in 1999 and currently 7450 ha are known to be infested with the weed. To date none of the infestations have been eradicated. Given recent (2008) levels of investment and current eradication methods, model predictions are that it would take, on average, an additional 73 years to eradicate this weed at an average additional cost (NPV) of $AU 67. 9 m. When the model was run for circumstances in 2003 and 2006, the average programme duration and total cost (NPV) were predicted to be 159 and 94 years, and $AU 91. 3 m and $AU 72. 3 m, respectively.
