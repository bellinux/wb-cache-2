In 1960, construction was begun on McCormick Place, a huge exposition and convention complex at 23rd Street and Lake Shore Drive named <b>for</b> <b>newspaper</b> magnate Robert R. McCormick. The original building burned in 1967, and was rebuilt and reopened in 1971 {{at the behest of}} mayor Richard J. Daley. Large expansions were added in 1986, 1997 and 2007. The current redevelopment includes greatly expanded hotel accommodation. McCormick Place also houses the Arie Crown Theater, and it is the annual location for the Chicago Auto Show.|$|E

He also held the federal seat of O'Connor in Western Australia, which included much of the Great Southern region and significant areas of plantation forests. Tuckey and the forest industry had a close relationship, {{to the extent that}} the industry paid <b>for</b> <b>newspaper</b> advertisements that reproduced a letter from Tuckey, following critical coverage of forestry MIS schemes in the media. Great Southern also reproduced Tuckey's letter in their 2000 Annual Report.|$|E

5|$|Growing up {{primarily}} at Langley Field, Virginia, Olds virtually made daily {{contact with the}} small group of officers who would lead the US Army Air Forces in World War II (one neighbor was Major Carl Spaatz, destined to become the first Chief of Staff of the USAF), and as a result was imbued with an unusually strong dedication to the air service, and conversely, with a low tolerance for officers who did not exhibit the same. On November 10, 1925, his father appeared as a witness on behalf of Billy Mitchell during Mitchell's court-martial in Washington, D.C.. He brought three-year-old Robin with him to court, dressed in an Air Service uniform, and posed with him <b>for</b> <b>newspaper</b> photographers before testifying.|$|E
5|$|When his {{apprenticeship}} {{ended in}} 1847, Evans, then 21, refused {{an offer of}} employment from Landells, deciding instead to go into business for himself as a wood-engraver and colour printer. In 1848 Evans engraved a title-page illustration, among other commissions, for the Illustrated London News. However, the Illustrated London News stopped employing him {{on the basis that}} his wood engraving was too fine <b>for</b> <b>newspaper</b> work. His final print for the Illustrated London News showed the four seasons, and was illustrated by Foster. In fact Foster received his first commission from the publisher Ingram, Cook, and Company to reproduce the four scenes in oil. In 1851, Ingram chose Evans to engrave three prints for Ida Pfeiffer's Travels in the Holy Land. He used three blocks for the work: the key-block, outlining the illustration, was printed in a dark-brown hue; the other two were in a buff colour and a grayish-blue colour. For the same firm, Evans completed an order for a book-cover using bright reds and blues on white paper. That year he received the first commission to print a book, written by Fanny Fern and illustrated by Foster. Evans had enough business to apprentice his two younger brothers, Wilfred and Herbert, and to buy a hand-press. Soon he moved his premises to Racquet Court, and bought three more hand-presses.|$|E

25|$|Because of the clear, bold {{nature of}} the large serifs, slab serif designs are often used for posters and in small print. Many monospace fonts, on which all {{characters}} occupy {{the same amount of}} horizontal space as in a typewriter, are slab-serif designs. While not always purely slab-serif designs, many fonts intended <b>for</b> <b>newspaper</b> use have large slab-like serifs for clearer reading on poor-quality paper. Many early slab-serif types, being intended for posters, only come in bold styles with the key differentiation being width, and often have no lower-case letters at all.|$|E
25|$|Technological {{developments}} in the late-19th century such as the development of lithography and photography led to diversification and specialization among printers. Further fragmentation in the printing labor movement led {{to the establishment of}} the International Printing Pressmen Union of North America (IPPU), in 1889. In 1892, the ITU authorized membership for mailers and <b>for</b> <b>newspaper</b> writers. Pressure mounted for a separate pressman's union, and in 1892 the International Brotherhood of Bookbinders (IBB) was formed. Many pressmen left the ITU for the Bookbinders. At the same time as mailers joined, two thousand pressmen members seceded to form the International Printing Pressmen Union Assistants, (IPPUA) in 1897 and the International Stereotypers' and Electroplater's Union, (IS) in 1902. At the start of the 20th Century, ITU membership was primarily compositors and mailers.|$|E
