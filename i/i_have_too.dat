Think about it: If you {{lived on a}} block with $300,000 houses and you sold yours for $2.5 million, your neighbors would thank you. But in my business they don't. That used to make me angry.

500|$|... "The Sixth Extinction II: Amor Fati" [...] is the series' last episode {{to feature}} Mimi Rogers as Agent Fowley. After reading {{a copy of}} the script, Rogers {{realized}} that her character was going to die before she reached the ending. The script included a large part for Fowley, which Rogers described as [...] "by far the most [...] had to do in an episode." [...] She later explained, [...] "It occurred to me , uh oh, this is way too good. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>too</b> much to do. They're going to kill me." ...|$|E
500|$|Unlike the {{majority}} of his contemporaries, Simpson was open about the use of drugs in professional cycling. In 1960, interviewed by Chris Brasher for The Observer newspaper, Simpson spoke about his understanding of how riders could beat him, saying: [...] "I know from the way they ride the next day they are taking dope. I don't want to have to take it– <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>too</b> much respect for my body." [...] Two years before his death, Simpson hinted in the newspaper, The People, at drug-taking in races, although he implied that he himself was not involved. Asked about drugs by Eamonn Andrews on the BBC Home Service radio network, Simpson did not deny taking them; however, he said that a rider who frequently took drugs might get to the top but would not stay there.|$|E

500|$|Jean-Jacques Rousseau's {{philosophical}} {{treatise on}} education, [...] (1762), {{is one of}} the major literary influences on Mary. A few months before starting the work, Wollstonecraft wrote to her sister Everina: [...] "I am now reading Rousseau's Emile, and love his paradoxes ... however he rambles into that chimerical world in which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>too</b> often wandered ... He was a strange inconsistent unhappy clever creature—yet he possessed an uncommon portion of sensibility and penetration" [...] (emphasis Wollstonecraft's). Rousseau, she notes, [...] "chuses [...] a common capacity to educate—and gives as a reason, that a genius will educate itself" [...] (emphasis Wollstonecraft's). When Mary was published, the title page included a quotation from Rousseau: [...] "L'exercice des plus sublimes vertus éleve et nourrit le génie" [...] ("the exercise of the most sublime virtues raises and nourishes genius"). The novel is therefore, in many ways, an early bildungsroman, or novel of education.|$|E
2500|$|Sturgeon {{met with}} new UK Prime Minister Theresa May in Edinburgh on 15 July 2016 after the latter {{had made it}} clear that UK unity was a high priority. Afterwards, Sturgeon said that [...] "It would be inconceivable for any prime {{minister}} to seek to {{stand in the way of}} a referendum if that is what the Scottish Parliament voted for ... if there's a clear sense that that's what people in Scotland want, would be completely the wrong thing to do." [...] She added a conciliatory note, however in her assessment of May: [...] "She's a woman who has a fairly businesslike way of doing things, which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>too.</b> So I think we can find a way of working together, notwithstanding those disagreements." ...|$|E
2500|$|During early {{conceptions of}} the album, Norwood had wanted to re-unite with Rodney [...] "Darkchild" [...] Jerkins – her {{longtime}} collaborator who had executive-produced Human (2008). However mid-way through 2009, during an interview with Out magazine, Norwood refused to talk about Human, telling interviews [...] "to hell with that album" [...] when questions were asked about it. It wasn't until 2010 when Norwood would break her silence during an episode of her VH1 reality TV show Brandy and Ray J: A Family Business. During one of the episodes when her brother Ray J announces {{that he wants to}} work with Darkchild, Norwood reveals that she felt the producer [...] "did not put his all into the album", and that [...] "was a personal issue between me and him." [...] Elaborating on what she meant, Norwood replied [...] "You know what kind of chemistry Rodney and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>too,</b> but on some personal issues, he doesn't deliver.....I don't want the same thing that happened to me, to happen to you.".|$|E

2500|$|In early 2006, Corgan {{moved in}} with Courtney Love and her daughter, Frances Bean Cobain. According to Love, {{he had his own}} wing in her new Hollywood Hills mansion. Two years later, Love criticized Corgan {{publicly}} over the latter's alleged refusal to attend Frances' sweet 16 birthday party. In March 2010, Corgan stated in an interview in reference about Love [...] "I have no interest in supporting her in any way, shape or form. You can't throw enough things down the abyss with a person like that" [...] and said he parted ways with her. Shortly after, when Hole's Nobody's Daughter was released, Corgan unleashed on Twitter a set of anger-filled words against her in reference to including two songs he wrote, [...] "Samantha" [...] and [...] "How Dirty Girls Get Clean", that ended up on the new album without his permission. Love then wrote an apology to him on her Facebook, but things heated up. Corgan took to Twitter again in six parts, attacking her again. Love responded to Corgan on Twitter, saying [...] "All i am is nice about you so if you wanna be mean be mean i dont feel anything. <b>i</b> <b>have</b> <b>too</b> much to feel dear." ...|$|E
