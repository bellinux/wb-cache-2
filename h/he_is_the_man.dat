25|$|Van Leeuwenhoek was a {{contemporary}} of another famous Delft citizen, the painter Johannes Vermeer, who was baptized {{just four days}} earlier. It {{has been suggested that}} <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> portrayed in two Vermeer paintings of the late 1660s, The Astronomer and The Geographer, however, others argue that there appears to be little physical similarity. Because they were both relatively important men in a city with only 24,000 inhabitants, it is likely that they were at least acquaintances; Van Leeuwenhoek acted as the executor of Vermeer's will after the painter died in 1675.|$|E

25|$|The {{moment of}} epiphany comes {{late in the}} play. At the {{beginning}} of Scene III, Oedipus is {{still waiting for the}} servant to be brought into the city, when a messenger arrives from Corinth to declare that King Polybus of Corinth is dead. Oedipus, when he hears this news, feels much relieved, because he believed that Polybus was the father whom the oracle had destined him to murder, and he momentarily believes himself to have escaped fate. He tells this all to the present company, including the messenger, but the messenger knows that it is not true. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> who found Oedipus as a baby in the pass of Cithaeron and gave him to King Polybus to raise. He reveals, furthermore that the servant who is being brought to the city as they speak is the very same man who took Oedipus up into the mountains as a baby. Jocasta realizes now all that has happened. She begs Oedipus not to pursue the matter further. He refuses, and she withdraws into the palace as the servant is arriving. The old man arrives, and it is clear at once that he knows everything. At the behest of Oedipus, he tells it all.|$|E

He is one of the main antagonists of Final Fantasy XII. <b>He</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> responsible for discovering the technology behind airships, as well as for the creation of manufacted, or artificial, nethicite. Cid is revealed during the game to be Balthier's father, whose ambitions drove Balthier away; this incident was the result of Cid going to Giruvegan to study more of the nethicite, only to return as a maniacal shell of his former self. During the game, Cid seems to talk to himself multiple times, but it is revealed that he is instead talking to Venat, a renegade Occurian; Occurians have the ability to make themselves seen and heard only by whom they wish.

500|$|While Amelia {{waits for}} the Doctor in the garden, the camera returns to her house where something, presumably Prisoner Zero, darts past the camera. It is {{actually}} Smith in footage intended for the finale, [...] "The Big Bang", but when it did not fit into that episode it was recycled here. Originally the scene where the Doctor confirms that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> she remembers by showing her the apple she gave him that day was cut due to pacing issues and that the fact had been established in a previous scene. The previous scene was then cut and the apple scene returned. Due to the rain, the scene where the Doctor tries to gain the Atraxi's attention with his sonic screwdriver had to be simplified. Adam Smith based {{the style of the}} confrontation on a Western film. The destruction of the sonic screwdriver shortly after was achieved with a spark effect concealed inside the screwdriver, activated by an electrical charge that reached the screwdriver by an electrical wire that ran up Smith's sleeve and connected to a receiver. Special effects head Danny Hargreaves then used a remote control to activate the device. Contrary to reports, the effect did not injure Smith. The [...] "fish fingers and custard" [...] scene was shot in 12 takes. The fish fingers were actually a breaded coconut-flavored food item; Smith estimated that he had eaten some 14 of them.|$|E
500|$|The film is not lost, but {{a modern}} {{synopsis}} {{has not been}} published. The official synopsis of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on December 24, 1910. It states: [...] "Jack Harkaway is of aristocratic birth, being {{the son of a}} wealthy Englishman's daughter and a poor young man, with whom she has eloped. Her parents bring about a separation and compel her to place the child in the hands of strangers, who are bribed to keep his whereabouts a secret from his mother. At the age of 12 Jack is placed in a school, the master of which is prejudiced against him, owing to the boy's mischievous disposition. After having received severe and unjust punishment from the schoolmaster, Jack decides to run away from school, and escapes from the room in which he is locked, through the window. Wandering along a country road, he accidentally overhears two sneak thieves planning to rob a house. Jack makes his way to the house in time to warn its mistress of the proposed robbery. Two [...] servants are placed in hiding, when the would-be thieves put in an appearance there and are immediately captured. Jack is given a fine supper by the lady of the house, who is very grateful to him. And when the schoolmaster, accompanied by Jack's guardian, arrives, she is touched by the boy's appeal not to be turned over to his rough-looking 'friends.' Upon getting a closer view of the man who calls himself the lad's guardian, she realizes that <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> to whom she was forced to give over her child. The man admits that Jack is her own boy, and the picture ends with the men being turned {{out of the house and}} Jack restored to his mother's arms." ...|$|E

2500|$|The terms verlig ("enlightened") and verkramp ("cramped") {{entered the}} Afrikaans (and later English) vernacular {{during the late}} 1960s. They were first used in a speech by prof. [...] (son of Jan de Klerk and brother of future State President of South Africa, F.W. de Klerk) on 6 October 1966, exactly {{a month after the}} {{assassination}} of dr. Hendrik Verwoerd. In his speech, De Klerk distinguished between verligte, verkrampte, and positiewe ("positive") Afrikaners. This threefold division would soon be simplified in the colloquial language to a simpler dichotomous partition between simply verlig and verkramp. What De Klerk called [...] "positive Afrikaners" [...] would then refer to what generally became known as verligte Afrikaners. He described positive Afrikaners (verligtes, thus) as [...] "purpose conscious Afrikaners". [...] "And purpose means to recognize the enduring and the changing. The closedness and the openness. The tradition and the progression... The purpose conscious Afrikaner recognizes and appreciates the tradition, and yet <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>man</b> of today and with a vision on tomorrow, until eternity. The Afrikaner heritage is the Afrikaner-Christendom with the Calvinistic bedrock which recognizes the authority of the Bible as revelation and guide. But also he is open to further study of Scripture and he seeks the new roads to expand his religious heritage. At the same time the Afrikaner culture is young and virile, and is still busy to form itself on many levels, without having to cut ties with the past. The Book teaches clearly that exaggerated nationalism (idolatry of the People) as well as cosmopolitism contrast with the stipulations of God. Just as ungodly is the nationalized religion, which is the same as idolatry of the People." ...|$|E

At the end of the show, Sam and Vic are said to plan to get married. When asked why Sam wants to marry Vic â€“ she always stated she did not have feelings for him, though he loved her â€“ she says it is because Vic understands her and will not try to change her; plus, he reminds her of Casey.|$|E
