5000|$|THE CLAIM FOR RESTITUTION OF THE FAREBasis {{on which}} the claim is advanced5. By cl.12 of her further amended writ of summons in personam, the {{respondent}} claimed: [...] "return of the full fare in the sum of $2,205.00 as for a total failure of consideration". By cl.7 of the defence, the appellant simply denied {{that there had been}} a total failure of consideration. At trial, the respondent's claim was refined so as to extend only to the balance of the fare not already refunded by the appellant, that balance being $1,417.50.6. Carruthers J. held that the contract of passage was an entire one and said:"In reality, the plaintiff got no benefit from this contract. It is true that she did have eight days cruising on the vessel and visited the Bay of Islands, Auckland, Tauranga, Wellington and Picton, but those benefits were entirely negated by the catastrophe which occurred upon departure from Picton. Thus, I would allow the amount claimed under this head."In the Court of Appeal, the appellant challenged the finding that there was a total failure of consideration. The challenge was rejected. Kirby P, with whom Gleeson C.J. agreed on this point, noted that the appellant had urged that there was no total failure of consideration as [...] "(t)he respondent had had the benefit of eight of fourteen days of an idyllic cruise." [...] He concluded that the contract of carriage was an entire one. Kirby P said:"On this point it is my view that Carruthers J reached the right conclusion. The respondent did not contract with the appellant for an eight-day cruise, still less for an eight-day cruise interrupted by the disaster which befell the MS Mikhail Lermontov. What she contracted for was a relaxing holiday experience. It is this that she failed to secure. The contract of carriage was properly categorised as an entire contract. I agree with the judge that there is a good analogy to Sir George Jessel MR's statement in Re Hall and Barker: '...If a shoemaker agrees to make a pair of shoes, he cannot offer you one shoe, and ask you to pay one half of the price.'"He then observed that, in order to avoid over-compensation, a claim for restitution of money paid on a total failure of consideration will succeed only if accompanied by counter-restitution of benefits bargained for and received by the claimant.7. In the Court of Appeal, the appellant also relied upon cl.9 of the printed ticket terms and conditions. That clause incorporated a right to proportional return of the consideration in certain circumstances. Kirby P. held that the clause, while it could exclude the right to restitution in certain circumstances, was inapplicable for two reasons: first, the clause was not incorporated into the contract of carriage; secondly, by reason of the admission of negligence by the appellant, the reason for the impossibility of continuation of the voyage was not [...] "beyond the control" [...] of the appellant and, therefore, a precondition of its operation was not satisfied. Gleeson CJ agreed generally that the ticket terms and conditions were not incorporated.However, he said that sufficient notice may have been given of some terms and conditions printed on the ticket so as to incorporate them. He did not consider cl.9 separately.8. Accordingly, the Court of Appeal, by majority, held that the respondent was entitled to restitution of the balance of the fare.9. In this Court, the appellant contends that the majority in the Court of Appeal erred in holding that the respondent was entitled to restitution of the whole of the fare. In support of this contention, the appellant submits that there was not a total failure of consideration arising from the fact that the contract of carriage was entire.The appellant also submits that a plaintiff cannot pursue both a claim for restitution of the consideration paid under a contract and a claim for damages for breach of that contract. It seems that this argument was not presented to, or considered by, the courts below. The merits of this argument, which will be considered below, do not necessarily depend on the availability of damages for disappointment and distress. That is but one head of damages whose recoverability is in question. However, if restitution is available and such damages are recoverable, questions of <b>double</b> <b>compensation</b> arise.Is the fare recoverable on the ground of total failure of consideration or otherwise?10. An entire contract or, perhaps more accurately, an entire obligation is one in which the consideration for the payment of money or for the rendering of some other counter-performance is entire and indivisible. In Steele v Tardiani, Dixon J. cited the general proposition stated in Edward Vaughan Williams's Notes to Saunders:"Where the consideration for the payment of money is entire and indivisible, as where the benefit expected by the defendant under the agreement is to result from the enjoyment of every part of the consideration jointly, so that the money payable is neither apportioned by the contract, nor capable of being apportioned by a jury, no action is maintainable, if any part of the consideration has failed; for, being entire, by failing partially, it fails altogether."11. The concept of an entire contract is material when a court is called upon to decide whether complete performance by one party is a condition precedent to the other's liability to pay the stipulated price or to render an agreed counter-performance. If this were a case in which the appellant sought to enforce a promise to pay the cruise fare at the conclusion of the voyage the concept would have a part to play; then, if the appellant's obligations were entire, on the facts as I have stated them, the appellant's incomplete performance of its obligations would not entitle it to recover.12. When, however, an innocent party seeks to recover money paid in advance under a contract in expectation of the entire performance by the contract-breaker of its obligations under the contract and the contract-breaker renders an incomplete performance, in general, the innocent party cannot recover unless there has been a total failure of consideration. If the incomplete performance results in the innocent party receiving and retaining any substantial part of the benefit expected under the contract, there will not be a total failure of consideration.13. In the context of the recovery of money paid on the footing that there has been a total failure of consideration, it is the performance of the defendant's promise, not the promise itself, which is the relevant consideration. In that context, the receipt and retention by the plaintiff of any part of the bargained-for benefit will preclude recovery, unless the contract otherwise provides or the circumstances give rise to a fresh contract. So, in Whincup v Hughes, the plaintiff apprenticed his son to a watchmaker for six years for a premium which was paid. The watchmaker died after one year. No part of the premium could be recovered. That was because there was not a total failure of consideration.A qualification to this general rule, more apparent than real, has been introduced in the case of contracts where a seller is bound to vest title to chattels or goods in a buyer and the buyer seeks to recover the price paid when it turns out that title has not been passed. Even if the buyer has had the use and enjoyment of chattels or goods purportedly supplied under the contract for a limited time, the use and enjoyment of the chattels or goods has been held not to amount to the receipt of part of the contractual consideration. Where the buyer is entitled under the contract to good title and lawful possession but receives only unlawful possession, he or she does not receive any part of what he or she bargained for. And thus, it is held, there is a total failure of consideration. As this Court stated in David Securities Pty Ltd v Commonwealth Bank:"the notion of total failure of consideration now looks to the benefit bargained for by the plaintiff rather than any benefit which might have been received in fact".14. An alternative basis for the recovery of money paid in advance pursuant to a contract in expectation of the receipt of the consideration to be provided by the defendant may arise when the defendant's right to retain the payment is conditional upon performance of his or her obligations under the contract. This basis of recovery has a superficial, but not a close, resemblance to the concept of an entire contract. In this class of case the plaintiff may be entitled to recover so long as the payment remains conditional.15. So, in Dies v British and International Mining and Finance Corporation, the plaintiff bought arms for the price of 135,000 pounds, paying 100,000 pounds in advance. Though unwilling or unable to take delivery, the plaintiff succeeded in recovering the payment, notwithstanding that Stable J held that there was not a total failure of consideration.There can, of course, be no such failure when the plaintiff's unwillingness or refusal to perform the contract on his or her part is the cause of the defendant's non-performance. The decision is explicable either on the ground that the seller accepted the plaintiff's repudiation and thus itself effected the discharge of the contract or on the ground that the payment was a mere part payment, the right to which depended upon performance of the contract and was thus conditional. Of the two explanations, the second is to be preferred because it is in closer accord with the judgment of Stable J. His Lordship said:"(W)here the language used in a contract is neutral, the general rule is that the law confers on the purchaser the right to recover his money, and that to enable the seller to keep it he must be able to point to some language in the contract from which the inference to be drawn is that the parties intended and agreed that he should".This statement in turn accords with the distinction drawn by Lord Denman C.J. (to which Stable J. referred) in Palmer v Temple between a deposit which was to be forfeited if the plaintiff should not perform the contract and a mere part payment the right to which depended upon performance of the contract. The statement also accords with the point made by Dixon J. in McDonald v Dennys Lascelles Ltd, where he said:"When a contract stipulates for payment of part of the purchase money in advance, the purchaser relying only on the vendor's promise to give him a conveyance, the vendor is entitled to enforce payment before the time has arrived for conveying the land; yet his title to retain the money has been considered not to be absolute but conditional upon the subsequent completion of the contract."16. The question whether an advance payment, not being a deposit or earnest of performance, is absolute or conditional is one of construction. In determining that question it is material to ascertain whether the payee is required by the contract to perform work and incur expense before completing this performance of his or her obligations under the contract. If the payee is so required then, unless the contract manifests a contrary intention, it would be unreasonable to hold that the payee's right to retain the payment is conditional upon performance of the contractual obligations.17. I have come to the conclusion in the present case that the respondent is not entitled to recover the cruise fare on either of the grounds just discussed. The consequence of the respondent's enjoyment of the benefits provided under the contract during the first eight full days of the cruise is that the failure of consideration was partial, not total. I do not understand how, viewed from the perspective of failure of consideration, the enjoyment of those benefits was [...] "entirely negated by the catastrophe which occurred upon departure from Picton", to repeat the words of the primary judge.18. Nor is there any acceptable foundation for holding that the advance payment of the cruise fare created in the appellant no more than a right to retain the payment conditional upon its complete performance of its entire obligations under the contract. As the contract called for performance by the appellant of its contractual obligations from the very commencement of the voyage and continuously thereafter, the advance payment should be regarded as the provision of consideration for each and every substantial benefit expected under the contract. It would not be reasonable to treat the appellant's right to retain the fare as conditional upon complete performance when the appellant is under a liability to provide substantial benefits to the respondent during the course of the voyage. After all, the return of the respondent to Sydney at the end of the voyage, though an important element in the performance of the appellant's obligations, was but one of many elements.In order to illustrate the magnitude of the step which the respondent asks the Court to take, it is sufficient to pose two questions, putting to one side cl.9 of the printed ticket terms and conditions. Would the respondent be entitled to a return of the fare if, owing to failure of the ship's engines, the ship was unable to proceed on the last leg of the cruise to Sydney and it became necessary to airlift the respondent to Sydney? Would the fare be recoverable if, owing to a hurricane, the ship was compelled to omit a visit to one of the scheduled ports of call? The answer in each case must be a resounding negative.19. The respondent sought to derive support from authorities relating to the contracts for the carriage of goods by sea which hold that freight is due on the arrival of the goods at the agreed destination. More to the point is the principle that an advance by the shipper on account of the freight to be earned is, in the absence of any stipulation to the contrary, [...] "an irrevocable payment at the risk of the shipper of the goods". The result of this rule is that an advance on account of freight may be retained, notwithstanding that, because of a failure to complete the voyage and to deliver the goods, the freight remains unearned and that a payment due as an advance on account of freight is recoverable (if not duly paid) even after frustration of the voyage.This does not mean that freight is earned prior to delivery: it will be earned upon shipment only if the parties expressly so stipulate). This rule, although it has been said to be a stipulation introduced into such contracts by custom and not the result of applying some abstract principle, would certainly exclude a restitutionary claim on facts analogous to those in the present case.The combination of a claim for restitution and a claim for damages20. In view of my conclusion that the respondent cannot succeed in her restitutionary claim for recoupment of the fare, there is no necessity for me to consider whether the two claims can be maintained. However, as the question has been argued, I should record my view of the question. There is authority to suggest that the claims are alternative and not cumulative. But Lord Denning MR was clearly of the view that the claims may be concurrent. In Heywood v Wellers, he said:"(The plaintiff) could recover the 175 pounds as money paid on a consideration which had wholly failed. She was, therefore, entitled to recover it as of right. And she is entitled to recover as well damages for negligence. Take this instance. If you engage a driver to take you to the station to catch a train for a day trip to the sea, you pay him 2 pounds - and then the car breaks down owing to his negligence. So that you miss your holiday. In that case you can recover not only your 2 pounds back but also damages for the disappointment, upset and mental distress which you suffered".Lord Denning was speaking of negligence in the sense of breach of a contractual obligation of due care. He noted a qualification to the entitlement to maintain the two claims:"Some reduction should be made for the fact that if the (defendants) had done their duty... it would have cost her something."That reduction was accordingly made to the damages for breach of contract.21. Similarly, in Millar's Machinery Company Limited v David Way and Son, the Court of Appeal dismissed an appeal from a decision of Branson J. in which such a dual award was made. The case concerned a contract for supply of machinery. It was held {{that there had been a}} total failure of consideration and that the purchasers were entitled to recover the amount paid on account. In addition, the purchasers were held to be entitled to damages, the proper measure of which was:"the sum which the (purchasers) had to spend to put themselves in the positi{{on which the}}y would have been if the (suppliers) had carried out their contract".That amount was the difference between the contract price and the amount which they had to pay to another supplier for a similar machine.22. And Treitel says in relation to claims for loss of bargain, reliance loss and restitution:"There is sometimes said to be an inconsistency between combining the various types of claim... The true principle is not that there is any logical objection to combining the various types of claim, but that the plaintiff cannot combine them so as to recover more than once for the same loss ... The point has been well put by Corbin: 'full damages and complete restitution ... will not both be given for the same breach of contract'."23. The action to recover money paid on a total failure of consideration is on a common money count for money had and received to the use of the plaintiff. To the extent that it is necessary to say so, this decision correctly reflects the law in Australia and, to the extent that it is inconsistent, should be preferred to the decision of this Court in In re Continental C. and G. Rubber Co. Proprietary Ltd.. The action evolved from the writ of indebitatus assumpsit. It is available only if the contract has been discharged, either for breach or following frustration, and if there has been a total, and not merely partial, failure of consideration. It is now clear that, in these cases, the discharge operates only prospectively, that is, it is not equivalent to rescission ab initio [...] Nor is rescission ab initio a precondition for recovery. Unconditionally accrued rights, including accrued rights to sue for damages for prior breach of the contract, are not affected by the discharge. Prepayments can, in general, be recovered, but the position of deposits or earnests is not entirely clear, the better view being that they are not recoverable if paid to provide a sanction against withdrawal.24. In 1846, when Pollock CB held in Walstab v Spottiswoode that it was not possible to combine a claim for damages with one for restitution, the restitutionary action was brought on the writ of indebitatus assumpsit, was essentially a procedural development, simplifying recovery and providing a more convenient or more summary remedy). Subsequently, Lord Wright said in Fibrosa Spolka Akcyjna v Fairbairn Lawson Combe Barbour Ltd:"The writ of indebitatus assumpsit involved at least two averments, the debt or obligation and the assumpsit [...] The former was the basis of the claim and was the real cause of action. The latter was merely fictitious and could not be traversed, but was necessary to enable the convenient and liberal form of action to be used in such cases."The action was, as Lord Mansfield said in Moses v Macferlan, [...] "quasi ex contractu" [...] and founded on an obligation imposed by law and accommodated within the system of formal pleading by means of the fictitious assumpsit or promise. It was necessary to plead the fictitious assumpsit until the enactment of s.3 of the Common Law Procedure Act 1852 (Eng.). And even then its influence continued.The abolition of the forms of action inspired an analysis of the sources of obligation in the common law in terms of a rigid dichotomy between contract and tort. In that context, there was little room for restitutionary obligation imposed by law except as a [...] "quasi-contractual" [...] appendix to the law of contract. As a result, until recently, restitutionary claims were disallowed when a promise could not be implied in fact. However, since Pavey and Matthews Pty Ltd v Paul, such an approach no longer represents the law in Australia.25. But, in the circumstances prevailing in 1846, it is not difficult to see that a plaintiff would necessarily be put to an election between the real and fictitious promises. In cases of tort it is equally plain that there had to be a choice between an action on a fictitious assumpsit (waiving the tort) and seeking damages for the tort.26. The decision in Walstab v Spottiswoode may also be seen as a consequence of two historical threads. The first is the competition in the latter part of the sixteenth century between the judges of the King's Bench and those of the Common Pleas as to the relationship between debt and assumpsit [...] The critical decision in the resolution of the conflict was Slade's Case. While the precise contemporary import of the decision is a matter of controversy, it was taken in the seventeenth century as deciding that indebitatus assumpsit lay as well as debt to recover sums due under a contract in the absence of an express subsequent promise to pay. The assumpsit or promise was founded [...] "not upon any fiction of law, but upon an interpretation of facts by the court which led it to the genuine conclusion that the parties had actually agreed (to make the payment)".27. The second is the decision at around the same time that indebitatus assumpsit lay in circumstances where the assumpsit was necessarily imputed rather than genuinely implied from the facts. Arris v Stukley is an example. In that case, the defendant, who had been granted by letters patent the office of comptroller of the customs at the port of Exeter, continued to pretend title to that office after its termination and grant to the plaintiff. The Court held that indebitatus assumpsit lay to recover the profits received by the defendant after the grant of the office to the plaintiff. In Holmes v Hall Holt CJ refused to nonsuit the plaintiff who sued on an indebitatus assumpsit to recover moneys he paid as executor to the defendant who held certain writings of the testator. The defendant failed to perform his promise to deliver up the writings.28. But it was recognized early on that cases like Holmes v Hall were equally cases of breach of contract in which a special assumpsit lay, and the question was raised whether the plaintiff should be required to bring his or her action in that form. In Moses v Macferlan, Lord Mansfield said that the plaintiff would be permitted to proceed on an indebitatus assumpsit, although an action for damages in covenant or on a special assumpsit was available. He continued:"If the plaintiff elects to proceed in this favourable way (on the indebitatus assumpsit [...] ), it is a bar to his bringing another action upon the agreement; though he might recover more upon the agreement, than he can by this form of action."He referred to Dutch v. Warren, where the general principles were re-stated as follows:"(T)he defendant by a refusal to execute, or by a complete and selfevident inability to perform, or by a fraudulent execution he has given the plaintiff an option to disaffirm the contract, and recover the consideration he was paid for it in the same manner as if it had never existed ... But then the contract must be totally rescinded, and appear unexecuted in every part at the time of bringing the action; since otherwise, the contract is affirmed by the plaintiff's having received part of that equivalent for which he has paid his consideration, and it is then reduced to a mere question of damages proportionate to the extent to which it remains unperformed."See also Greville v Da Costa.29. This insistence on rescission or the non-existence of an [...] "open" [...] contract makes it easier to understand how the decision in Chandler v Webster. We now know the effect of discharge to be different and, as Fibrosa indicates, nothing more than that usual effect is necessary to ground the action to recover money paid on a total failure of consideration.Conclusion: the respondent cannot recover the fare and damages for breach of contract30. The old forms of action cannot provide the answer today. But, in my view, Walstab v Spottiswoode and the earlier cases support the view expressed by Corbin and Treitel that full damages and complete restitution will not be given for the same breach of contract. There are several reasons. First, restitution of the contractual consideration removes, at least notionally, the basis on which the plaintiff is entitled to call on the defendant to perform his or her contractual obligations. More particularly, the continued retention by the defendant is regarded, in the language of Lord Mansfield, as [...] "against conscience" [...] or, in the modern terminology, as an unjust enrichment of the defendant because the condition upon which it was paid, namely, performance by the defendant may not have occurred. But, equally, that performance, for deficiencies in which damages a re sought, was conditional on payment by the plaintiff. Recovery of the money paid destroys performance of that condition. Secondly, the plaintiff will almost always be protected by an award of damages for breach of contract, which in appropriate cases will include an amount for substitute performance or an amount representing the plaintiff's reliance loss. Nothing said here is inconsistent with McRae v. Commonwealth Disposals Commission.31. I would therefore conclude that, even if the respondent had an entitlement to recover the cruise fare, Carruthers J. and the majority of the Court of Appeal erred in allowing restitution of the balance of the fare along with damages for breach of contract. The consequences of this conclusion will be considered below in light of the conclusion to be reached with regard to the award of damages for disappointment and distress.|$|E

40|$|This article {{attempts}} {{to highlight the}} potential danger in applying private-law principles to social-security law in deciding whether or not social grants should be deducted from awards for damages. Typically, this issue comes to the fore where a damage-causing event, such as death, sets into motion a system that provides for the payment of social benefits, damages or both. In social-security law, the receipt {{of more than one}} social benefit is called "double dipping", whereas in private law the problem of <b>double</b> <b>compensation</b> is addressed by applying the collateral-source rule. In some instances the applicable legislation clearly prescribes the deduction or not of the social benefit, but unfortunately our legislation is not always clear on this issue and this can best be illustrated by two recent conflicting decisions in Makhuvela (SGHC) and Timis (SCA). In Makhuvela the court held that a foster-care grant should be disregarded in calculating the award for damages, inter alia because the child will never have a claim to the grant. In Timis the SCA distinguished the facts from Makhuvela and held that the child-support grants received by the mother after the father's death are directly linked to the death of the father and should therefore be deducted from her claim for loss of support. It is submitted that although the outcome of the Timis decision is correct, the court should have incorporated the means test into the process of deciding if the grant should be deducted from the compensation. A two-phase approach is suggested: first determine if the receipt of the grant is directly linked to the death of the breadwinner, and secondly determine how the grant and the subsequent settlement paid by a wrongdoer will affect the circumstances of a particular individual or family. The objectives in social-security law differ from the objectives in the law of damages and therefore the principles applied in cases of double dipping cannot be equated with those applied in cases of collateral benefits...|$|E

40|$|Voltage sensors {{based on}} the Pockels {{electro-optic}} effect in LiNbO 3 crystals have been applied to practical engineering measurements because of their passive nature, wide operating bands, and low transmission loss. However, {{the temperature of the}} measurement environment can greatly affect the dynamic responses of these sensors because the natural birefringence of a single LiNbO 3 crystal voltage sensor (SVS) is related to its temperature. To improve the stability of this sensor over a wide temperature range, a <b>double</b> crystal <b>compensation</b> method is introduced in this paper to compensate for the natural birefringence of the SVS. A double LiNbO 3 crystal voltage sensor (DVS) was fabricated, and its working point drift characteristics and amplitude-frequency response were investigated over the temperature range from 0 °C to 50 °C. The effects of two intrinsic parameters of the LiNbO 3 crystal were also investigated. Comparison between an existing SVS and the proposed DVS showed that the DVS resisted environmental temperature fluctuations more strongly...|$|R
40|$|Many {{extended}} Boolean models such as fuzzy set, $p$-norm, et al. {{have been}} proposed in the information retrieval literature to support ranking facility for the Boolean retrieval system. They can be explained within the same framework, and each extended Boolean model is characterized by evaluation formulas for AND and OR operations. A variety of operators have been also developed {{in the area of}} fuzzy set theory for AND and OR operations, and can be used in extended Boolean models. In this paper we analyze the behavioral aspects of various operators for AND and OR operations, and address important properties in terms of retrieval effectiveness. Our analyses show that the four properties, namely single operand dependency, negative <b>compensation,</b> <b>double</b> operand dependency and unequal importance decrease retrieval effectiveness in some circumstances. This suggests that the two properties, namely positive compensation and equal importance might help retrieval effectiveness. We also provide the experimental results that coincide with our analyses...|$|R
40|$|Overlapped block motion {{compensation}} or B-frames {{are examples of}} multihypothesis {{motion compensation}} where several motion-compensated signals are superimposed to reduce the bit-rate of a video codec. This paper extends the wide-sense stationary theory of motion-compensated prediction (MCP) for hybrid video codecs to multihypothesis motion compensation. The power spectrum of the prediction error {{is related to the}} displacement error probability density functions (pdf's) of an arbitrary number of hypotheses in a closed-form expression. We then study the influence of motion compensation accuracy on the efficiency of multihypothesis motion compensation as well as the influence of the residual noise level and the gain from optimal combination of hypotheses. For the noise-free limiting case, doubling the number of (equally good) hypotheses can yield a gain of up to 1 2 bits/sample, while doubling the accuracy of motion compensation (such as going from integer-pel to 1 2 -pel accuracy) can additionally reduce the bit-rate by up to 1 bit/sample independent of. For realistic noise levels, it is shown that the introduction of B-frames or overlapped block motion compensation can provide larger gains than <b>doubling</b> motion <b>compensation</b> accuracy. Spatial filtering of the motion-compensated candidate signals becomes less important if more hypotheses are combined. The critical accuracy beyond which the gain due to more accurate motion compensation is small moves to larger displacement error variances with increasing noise and increasing number of hypotheses. Hence, sub-pel accurate motion compensation becomes less important with multihypothesis MCP. The theoretical insights are confirmed by experimental results for overlapped block motion compensation, B-frames, and multiframe motion- [...] ...|$|R
40|$|This study {{aimed at}} {{analysing}} first-time hospitalisations for {{traumatic brain injury}} (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) in Western Australia (WA), in terms of socio-demographic profile, cause of injury, relative risks and survival, using tabular and regression analyses of linked hospital discharge and mortality census files and comparing results with published standardised mortality rates (SMRs) for TBI. Participants were all 9, 114 first hospital admissions for TBI or SCI from 7 / 2003 to 6 / 2008, linked to mortality census data through 12 / 2008, and the main outcome measures were number of cases by cause, SMRs in hospital and post-discharge by year through year 5. Road crashes accounted for 34  % of hospitalised TBI and 52  % of hospitalised SCI. 8, 460 live TBI discharges experienced 580 deaths during 24, 494 person-years of follow-up. The life-table expectation of deaths in the cohort was 164. Post-discharge SMRs were 7. 66 in year 1, 3. 86 in year 2 and averaged 2. 31 in years 3 through 5. 317 live SCI discharges experienced 18 deaths during 929  years of follow-up. Post-discharge SMRs were 7. 36 in year 1 and a fluctuating average of 2. 13 in years 2 through 5. Use of data from model systems {{does not appear to}} yield biased SMRs. Similarly no systematic variation was observed between all-age studies and the more numerous studies that focused on those aged 14 to 16 and older. Based on two studies, SMRs for TBI, however, may be higher in year 2 post-discharge in Australia than elsewhere. That possibility and its cause warrant exploration. Expanding public TBI/SCI compensation in WA from road crash to all causes might triple TBI <b>compensation</b> and <b>double</b> SCI <b>compensation...</b>|$|R
40|$|Many gait pathologies (e. g. stroke, injury, joint replacement, amputation) {{result in}} both {{bilateral}} asymmetry and substantial metabolic and biomechanical costs. Despite this, {{the role of}} gait asymmetry during walking remains uncertain; gait asymmetry may either be caused by the pathology or may be adaptive, minimizing {{the costs associated with}} an already problematic situation. Here I asked, are there inherent costs to gait asymmetry independent of gait pathology and beyond that imposed by non-preferred step times? To answer this question, I measured the rate of metabolic energy expenditure and calculated mechanical power production while healthy adults walked symmetrically and asymmetrically at a range of step and stride times. I found that walking with asymmetric steps required more metabolic power than symmetric gait at corresponding step times. The positive mechanical power production increased with increasing asymmetry, paralleling the increases I observed in metabolic power. I suggest that the increased need for mechanical power may result from increased power absorption during <b>double</b> support and <b>compensation</b> through increased power production during single support. Overall, I identify an inherent metabolic and mechanical cost to gait asymmetry and find that symmetry is optimal in healthy, symmetric adults...|$|R
50|$|At this time, the Greek {{government}} {{tried to}} resolve another core issue pertaining to the Cham Albanians, the property dispute. In 1928, the Venizelos government had withdrawn from the Greco-Albanian agreement, signed by Pangalos that would compensate Chams equally with other Greek citizens. Muslim Chams tried to regain their properties under the Law of 1926, which gave {{them the opportunity to}} dispute the confiscation of their properties before the courts. Following these actions, Greece passed two laws, in 1930 and 1931, which gave bigger compensations to the Muslim community, {{but not as much as}} to other Greek citizens. The first law <b>doubled</b> the promised <b>compensation,</b> and forced the state authorities to give 3/4 of the promised compensation, even if they appealed the decisions in the courts. The second law returned some of the lands that were not settled by Greeks to Cham Albanians. Both laws were implemented on a limited scale, because of the change of the Greek government and the establishment of the dictatorial Metaxas Regime. At that time, members of the Cham community suffered from discrimination due to severe expropriations of their lands.|$|R
40|$|Irrespective of its Western origin, {{the idea}} of human rights is widely acknowledged. Following the {{establishment}} of the United Nations, the movement of human rights has been dramatically extended from its local boundaries to a more global domain by means of international treaties, declarations, conferences etc by which a universal standard of human rights has been established. However, a sharp contrast has occurred between advocates of relativism of human rights and supporters of the universalism of human rights as a result of attempts to impose a single interpretation to human rights instruments that is the western liberal tradition. After the collapse of the communist regimes, the conflict about the universalism of human rights takes place between developed and less developed Countries, or between Islam, and the West. Therefore, this thesis explores the extent to which human rights jurisprudence can accommodate different cultures. The thesis concerns particular aspects of the subject of human rights. It compares rights provided for the accused person during trial in the judicial system in Saudi Arabia with those embodied in the European Convention on Human Rights. It examines in particular; the presumption of innocence, the principle of legality, legal assistance, an interpreter, adequatg time and facilities, a speedy trial, prompt information of the accusation, trial {{in the presence of the}} accused, the accused's right to defend himself in person, equality of arms, the calling and cross-examination of witnesses, the right not to be compelled to confess guilt, an independent and an impartial trial, an open court, a reasoned judgment, an appeal against conviction or punishment, <b>double</b> jeopardy, and <b>compensation</b> for miscarriage of justice. The thesis shows that (a) generally speaking, the judicial system in Saudi Arabia provides the accused during the trial stage with similar rights to those called upon by the European Convention although it sometimes uses different terminology. (b) Suggestions to readdress deficiencies in the Saudi judicial system can be adopted without violating Islamic law. (c) The Saudi judicial system in certain areas provides the same rights with a higher standard of application. (d) Due to the fact that it is based on the religion of Islam, the Saudi judicial system provides the accused with rights totally unknown to the European Convention.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{deals with}} techniques for designing integrated amplifiers with high linearity. Amplifiers with operating frequencies from Audio to RF have been built. An enhanced feedback configuration, capable of very low distortion, is presented. Also presented is a statistical method for relating the distortion of a wideband {{signal to the}} total harmonic distortion (THD) of a single tone. Two fully integrated class AB CMOS audio power amplifiers {{that are capable of}} driving 8 Ohm loudspeaker loads directly from the chip are presented. Two different topologies are used, both resulting in low distortion and high output voltage swing. The second amplifier operates with supply voltages down to 1. 5 V. Both amplifiers feature advanced phase compensation strategies to be able to drive loudspeakers with up to 100 nF and down to 8 Ohm without external components, such as load stabilising networks. Two wideband IF amplifiers are presented. They are fully integrated and have high linearity from DC to 20 MHz. Both have differential inputs and outputs. To achieve high linearity, large feedback together with <b>double</b> nested Miller <b>compensation</b> are used, resulting in a high degree of linearisation of the output stage. One of the amplifiers is built in CMOS and the other is built using npn-only bipolar technology. One fully integrated RF power amplifier in 0. 8 um CMOS without coils is presented. The purpose of this amplifier is to investigate how fast and linear a power amplifier can be made in CMOS, without using coils to resonate with major parasitic capacitances. This investigation is done {{in order to be able}} to build fast RF power amplifiers without coils when the speed of the CMOS processes increases in the future. An enhanced feedback scheme, which is the subject to a patent application, is also presented. By connecting a negative impedance to the inverting input of a feedback amplifier, the feedback can be boosted to become infinite at a certain frequency. Thereby the distortion at this frequency can be eliminated completely. The gain of the arrangement is equal to that with an ideal amplifier. Finally a novel method of how to relate the intermodulation distortion of a wideband signal to the total harmonic distortion (THD) of a single tone test is presented. The motivation for this is that the THD, as opposed to the intermodulation distortion of the wideband signal, is easy to measure and use as a design parameter. It is shown how to select both the amplitude and the frequency of the single tone to get the same distortion power as with a wideband signal...|$|R
