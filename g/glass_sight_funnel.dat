50|$|Engine safety {{appliances}} were sparse. The Bourdon gauge for pressure readings was patented in 1849. A rival gauge {{was developed in}} 1857 by Wooten. <b>Glass</b> <b>sight</b> gauges for boiler water level were not popular until the 1890s. Part {{of the problem was}} production of the proper glass, and the sealing of the gauge.|$|R
50|$|Simple <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> {{may be just}} {{a plastic}} or glass tube {{connected}} {{to the bottom of}} the tank at one end and the top of the tank at the other. The level of liquid in the <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> will be the same as the level of liquid in the tank. Today, however, sophisticated float switches have replaced <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> in many such applications.|$|R

60|$|Upon this, vague {{though they}} were, my suspicions returned; and I closely {{questioned}} the Islander concerning {{the disappearance of}} these important articles. In reply, he gave me to understand, that the nautical instruments had been clandestinely carried down into the forecastle by Annatoo; and by that indefatigable and inquisitive dame they had been summarily taken apart for scientific inspection. It was impossible to restore them; {{for many of the}} fixtures were lost, including the colored <b>glasses,</b> <b>sights,</b> and little mirrors; and many parts still recoverable, were so battered and broken as to be entirely useless. For several days afterward, we now and then came across bits of the quadrant or sextant; but it was only to mourn over their fate.|$|R

50|$|A vector bombsight {{where the}} bomb aimer input {{details of the}} bombload, target {{altitude}} and wind direction and the analogue computer then continuously calculated the trajectory of the bombs and projected an inverted sword shape onto a <b>sighting</b> <b>glass</b> on the <b>sighting</b> head. Assuming the sight was set correctly, when the target was in the cross hairs of the sword shape, the bomb aimer {{would be able to}} accurately release the bombs.|$|R
50|$|Industrial {{observational}} instruments {{have changed}} with industry itself. More structurally sophisticated than the water gauge, the contemporary <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> — {{also called the}} sight window or sight port — {{can be found on}} the media vessel at chemical plants and in other industrial settings, including pharmaceutical, food, beverage and bio gas plants. <b>Sight</b> <b>glasses</b> enable operators to visually observe processes inside tanks, pipes, reactors and vessels. The modern industrial <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> is a glass disk held between two metal frames, which are secured by bolts and gaskets, or the glass disc is fused to the metal frame during manufacture. The glass used for this purpose is either soda lime glass or borosilicate glass, and the metal, usually a type of stainless steel, is chosen for desired properties of strength. Borosilicate glass is superior to other formulations in terms of chemical corrosion resistance and temperature tolerance, as well as transparency. Fused <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are also called mechanically prestressed glass, because the glass is strengthened by compression of the metal ring. Heat is applied to a glass disc and its surrounding steel ring, causing a fusion of the materials. As the steel cools, it contracts, compressing the glass and making it resistant to tension. Because glass typically breaks under tension, mechanically prestressed glass is unlikely to break and endanger workers. The strongest <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are made with borosilicate glass, because of the greater difference in its coefficient of expansion.|$|R
50|$|Apart {{from these}} basic type, the hose/pipe {{connection}} part can be various type such as flange, butt welding, truck use <b>sight</b> <b>glass,</b> etc.|$|R
50|$|At 15:31 on 18 September, Thresher <b>sighted</b> the masts, <b>funnel</b> {{and bridge}} {{of a ship}} on the horizon. After {{determining}} the enemy's base course and zigzag plan, Thresher surfaced and locked on the freighter with radar at 19:23. Another pip, an escort vessel, soon appeared on radar.|$|R

50|$|Static balance can be {{measured}} by a static balancing machine where the tire is placed in its vertical axis on a non-rotating spindle tool. The spot on the tire with the greatest mass is acted upon by gravity to deflect the tooling downward. The amount of deflection indicates {{the magnitude of the}} unbalance. The angle of the deflection indicates the angular location of the unbalance. In tire manufacturing factories, static balancers operate by use of sensors mounted to the spindle assembly. In tire retail shops, static balancers are usually non-rotating bubble balancers, where the magnitude and angle of the unbalance is observed by looking at the center bubble in an oil-filled <b>glass</b> <b>sighting</b> gauge. While some very small shops which lack specialized machines still do this process, they have been largely replaced in larger shops with machines.|$|R
5000|$|Water level indicators: They {{show the}} {{operator}} {{the level of}} fluid in the boiler, {{also known as a}} <b>sight</b> <b>glass,</b> water gauge or water column.|$|R
50|$|The {{one piece}} {{lubricator}} {{body is a}} gunmetal casting and incorporates the condensing chamber, the oil reservoir and the <b>sight</b> <b>glasses.</b> Passages within the body interconnect these areas. The body is fitted with a steam valve, a water valve, an oil control valve. <b>Sight</b> <b>glasses</b> are fitted at the front & back of the body {{on each of the}} feeds, these feeds are fitted with individual feed regulating valves for controlling the feed rate for each outlet. The oil control valve was used to either turn the supply off/on, or to shut off the supply to the cylinders and just supply the air compressor with oil whilst the locomotive is stationary on lubricators with a center feed. Each feed is also fitted with a drain valve for cleaning each <b>sight</b> <b>glass.</b> The body is also fitted with an oil chamber drain for draining the condensed water from the oil chamber.|$|R
50|$|A <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> {{or water}} gauge is a {{transparent}} tube {{through which the}} operator of a tank or boiler can observe the level of liquid contained within.|$|R
50|$|The {{accessories}} {{required for}} oil and gas separators are pressure gauges, thermometers, pressure-reducing regulators (for control gas), level <b>sight</b> <b>glasses,</b> safety head with rupture disk, piping, and tubing.|$|R
50|$|For safety reasons, {{nearly all}} steam engines are {{equipped}} with mechanisms to monitor the boiler, such as a pressure gauge and a <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> to monitor the water level.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: [...] "Wakefield" [...] brand {{displacement}} lubricator {{mounted on}} a locomotive boiler backplate. Through the right-hand <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> a drip of oil (travelling upwards through water) can be seen.|$|R
60|$|They were on {{him like}} a pack of hungry though dubious wolves. He pushed his <b>glass</b> out of <b>sight,</b> {{accepted}} one of the drinks pressed upon him, and leaned nonchalantly against the counter.|$|R
5000|$|Later {{types of}} {{lubricator}} (from around 1887), {{referred to as}} the [...] "sight-feed" [...] type, allowed a <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> to be positioned in the cab where the rate of oil feed could be observed.|$|R
50|$|Modified armed combat variant. Changes include {{composite}} armouring, toughened <b>glass,</b> and gun <b>sights.</b> Armaments {{include two}} jettisonable weapons pods, {{each of which}} contains a single 12.7 mm machine gun and up to three 70 mm rockets.|$|R
5000|$|The SR was {{originally}} developed under the design credo [...] "easy to use", and when Yamaha's Technical Director wrenched his ankle while testing a prototype, easier starting became a priority — and Yamaha developed a decompression lever and <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> system.|$|R
50|$|The {{steering}} column {{passes through the}} straight dashboard and spark and throttle levers worked in sectors inside the wheel rim. All main bearing were lubricated by a force feed lubricator, located {{in front of the}} dashboard. <b>Sight</b> <b>glasses</b> were attached to the left-hand side of the engine.|$|R
50|$|The cupola tender {{observes the}} furnace through the <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> or peep <b>sight</b> in the tuyeres. Slag {{will rise to}} the top of the pool of iron being formed. A slag hole, located higher up on the {{cylinder}} of the furnace, and usually to the rear or side of the tap hole, is opened to let the slag flow out. The viscosity is low (with proper fluxing) and the red hot molten slag will flow easily. Sometimes the slag which runs out the slag hole is collected in a small cup shaped tool, allowed to cool and harden. It is fractured and visually examined. With acid refractory lined cupolas a greenish colored slag means the fluxing is proper and adequate. In basic refractory lined cupolas the slag is brown.|$|R
50|$|The maximum fuel {{capacity}} is 115 liters, with 110 liters usable. The engine can use gasoline of 80/87 to 100/130 octane. Each wing contains an aluminum fuel tank in the root. Fuel quantity {{is indicated by}} <b>sight</b> <b>glasses</b> in the wing roots. There are two separate fuel selectors, for each tank, which can be independently opened and closed.|$|R
60|$|But in his cups {{that night}} he had thought in some dim way to {{precipitate}} matters by affronting Mr. Wilding, secure, as I have shown, in his belief that Wilding would perish sooner than raise a finger against Ruth's brother. And his drunken astuteness, it seemed, had been to his mind {{as a piece of}} bottle <b>glass</b> to the <b>sight,</b> distorting the image viewed through it.|$|R
50|$|The National Board of Boiler and Pressure Vessel Inspectors {{recommends}} a daily testing procedure {{described by the}} American National Standards Institute, chapter 2 part I-204.3 water level gauge. While not strictly required, this procedure is designed to allow an operator to safely verify that {{all parts of the}} <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> are operating correctly and have free flowing connections to the boiler necessary for proper operation.|$|R
50|$|The 7th Class {{represented}} a considerable advance {{in design and}} power. They were the first South African locomotives to be equipped with sight feed lubricators which allowed a <b>sight</b> <b>glass</b> to be positioned in the cab, where the rate of oil feed to the cylinders could be observed. The reversing gear was of the quick-threaded screw type instead of the reversing lever which had earlier been used.|$|R
5000|$|Another grand Suffolk {{church is}} St. Edmunds in Southwold, {{but it is}} not a [...] "wool" [...] church which boasts {{extraordinary}} painted chancel screens, although nearly all the medieval stained glass is gone, thanks to zealous Puritans during Cromwell's reign. Ironically, Peter Hobart, who served as assistant vicar of St. Edmunds, later left Suffolk for the Puritan Massachusetts Bay Colony, where he was instrumental in the building of Old Ship Church in Hingham, Massachusetts, the oldest church in continuous use in the United States. (A more vivid contrast to England's wool churches can hardly be imagined. Old Ship Church is a hand-hewn wooden structure with a modified Hammerbeam roof and not a shard of stained <b>glass</b> in <b>sight.)</b> ...|$|R
50|$|The {{sense of}} sight {{can also be}} used with a series of new and {{innovative}} technologies such as virtual reality. With the aid of these gadgets, firms and brands can provide customers with sensory experiences that are more immersive and would not be possible otherwise. Marriott Hotel's new 'Teleporter' is a great example: Where interested customers can use a pair of virtual reality <b>glasses</b> to see <b>sights</b> of potential travel destinations.|$|R
6000|$|Corresponding to the {{crescent}} in our van, we beheld another in our rear. It seemed formed of detached white vapors, {{rising and falling}} something like the spouts of the whales; only they did not so completely come and go; for they constantly hovered, without finally disappearing. Levelling his <b>glass</b> at this <b>sight,</b> Ahab quickly revolved in his pivot-hole, crying, [...] "Aloft there, and rig whips and buckets to wet the sails;--Malays, sir, and after us!" ...|$|R
25|$|Some of his inventions were an {{automated}} (self-striking) water clock (the Jagyeokru) which worked by activating motions of wooden figures to indicate time visually (invented in 1434 by Jang), a subsequent more complicated water-clock with additional astronomical devices, and an improved {{model of the}} previous metal movable printing type created in the Goryeo Dynasty. The new model was of even higher quality and was twice as fast. Other inventions were the <b>sight</b> <b>glass,</b> and the udometer.|$|R
50|$|The {{air-cooled}} engine has a gear-driven counterbalancer {{as well as}} a proprietary cylinder wall plating similar to a Nikasil coating. The coating, marketed as Suzuki Composite Electro-chemical Material or SCEM, is nickel-phosphorus-silicon-carbide based, reducing weight (by eliminating a steel liner) and improving heat transfer, allowing for tighter and more efficient piston-to-cylinder clearance. Valves are adjustable via 'screw and locknut' type clearance adjusters. The engine features an oil sump <b>sight</b> <b>glass,</b> enabling visual oil checks, and uses 87 octane fuel.|$|R
