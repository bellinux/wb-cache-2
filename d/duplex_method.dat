50|$|The Vedic <b>duplex</b> <b>method</b> {{from the}} book 'Vedic Mathematics' is {{a variant of the}} digit-by-digit method for calculating the square root. The duplex is the square of the central digit plus double the cross-product of digits {{equidistant}} from the center. The duplex is computed from the quotient digits (square root digits) computed thus far, but after the initial digits. The duplex is subtracted from the dividend digit prior to the second subtraction for the product of the quotient digit times the divisor digit. For perfect squares the duplex and the dividend will get smaller and reach zero after a few steps. For non-perfect squares the decimal value of the square root can be calculated to any precision desired. However, as the decimal places proliferate, the duplex adjustment gets larger and longer to calculate. The <b>duplex</b> <b>method</b> follows the Vedic ideal for an algorithm, one-line, mental calculation. It is flexible in choosing the first digit group and the divisor. Small divisors are to be avoided by starting with a larger initial group.|$|E

Materials and methods:Fifty-three consecutive patients underwent IA-DSA prior to carotid endarterectomy providing 103 carotid angiograms. Objective assessment of ICA stenosis was by the North American Symptomatic Carotid Endarterectomy Trial (NASCET) criterion and the Carotid Stenosis Index (CSI). Duplex estimation of stenosis was derived from peak systolic and diastolic velocities in the ICA and common carotid artery (CCA). Results:The coefficient of repeatability was poorest for NASCET stenosis estimates (40 %), whilst the improved values for CSI (20 %) {{were consistent with the}} lower variability recorded for measuring the CCA diameter. Correlation and agreement levels between subjective (r = 0. 8; 0; − 41 % to + 33 %) or objective assessments and duplex (NASCET: r= 0. 76; − 52 to + 28 %, CSI: r = 0. 72; − 27 to + 39 %) showed similar values. Conclusions:We conclude that the inter-observer variability for assessing angiograms obtained by arch injection is considerable and precludes high agreement when IA-DSA is compared with other methods.
