25|$|After the cuticle {{has been}} broken down, the next {{structure}} that is targeted is the medulla. This region is first colonized by hyphae present in the cuticle and fungal growth is more rapid <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> trichohyalin of the medulla is more readily digested than the keratin of the cuticle. The medullary mycelium then grow back towards the cuticle {{in a manner that}} makes the origin of the mycelium undetectable after 5–6 days of infection.|$|E
25|$|On 29 May 1799, Hannah and Joshua, {{and their}} two {{children}} set out from Portsmouth for India aboard the ship Criterion. Although there was a threat of a French naval attack the family landed safely at the Danish settlement of Serampore (a few miles north of Calcutta) on 13 October 1799. They had chosen to land <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> East India Company was still hostile to missionaries, they settled in the Danish colony at Serampore and were joined there by William Carey on 10 January 1800.|$|E

25|$|The {{confusion}} arises <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> bather is {{not asked}} if the puppy he is holding is a male, but rather if either is a male. If the puppies are labeled (A and B), each has a 50% chance of being male independently. This independence is restricted when at least A or B is male. Now, if A is not male, B must be male, and vice versa. This restriction is introduced {{by the way the}} question is structured and is easily overlookedmisleading people to the erroneous answer of 50%. See Boy or Girl paradox for solution details.|$|E
25|$|Running {{across the}} borough {{from the east}} end and ending in the west near the {{university}} campus is Avenida Miguel Angel de Quevedo. This street is lined with bookstores, such as Nalanda, El Sotano de Coyoacan, “Octavio Paz” and two branches of the Gandhi chain. The first {{was one of the}} Gandhi stores, placed in 1973 at the site of a former supermarket. The bookstores are <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> area is close to the Ciudad Universitaria and the student population that lives in the area. The bookstores have attracted other cultural businesses such as theaters cafes and restaurants. The second Gandhi store, called Gandhi 2000, was built to be a cultural center as well as a bookstore with literature related events, children’s activities, concerts and more. It also has a series of nude sculpture by Gabriel Ponzanelli.|$|E
500|$|For example, to find {{a number}} in a sorted list, the binary search {{algorithm}} checks the middle entry and proceeds with the half {{before or after the}} middle entry if the number is still not found. This algorithm requires, on average, [...] comparisons, where N is the list's length. Similarly, the merge sort algorithm sorts an unsorted list by dividing the list into halves and sorting these first before merging the results. Merge sort algorithms typically require a time approximately proportional to [...] The base of the logarithm is not specified <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> result only changes by a constant factor when another base is used.

500|$|In {{terms of}} energy: surface tension [...] of a liquid is {{the ratio of}} the change in the energy of the liquid, and the change in the surface area of the liquid (that led to the change in energy). This can be easily related to the {{previous}} definition in terms of force: if [...] is the force required to stop the side from starting to slide, then this is also the force that would keep the side in the state of sliding at a constant speed (by Newton's Second Law). But if the side is moving to the right (in the direction the force is applied), then the surface area of the stretched liquid is increasing while the applied force is doing work on the liquid. This means that increasing the surface area increases the energy of the film. The work done by the force [...] in moving the side by distance [...] {{is at the same time}} the total area of the film increases by [...] (the factor of 2 is <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> liquid has two sides, two surfaces). Thus, multiplying both the numerator and the denominator of [...] by , we get ...|$|E

Saba, in Hebrew, literally means [...] "army."

2500|$|During World War Two, {{the area}} near McKenzie's Jetty {{was used by}} the Services Reconnaissance Department (popularly known as [...] "Z Special Unit") as a special forces {{training}} camp – the Fraser Commando School. Thousands of soldiers were trained <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> conditions were similar to those found on Pacific Islands where the Japanese were fought. Lake McKenzie was used for parachute training and the wreck of the Maheno was used for explosive demolitions practice.|$|E
2500|$|While Gholam-Hossein Elham, an Iranian politician, {{argues that}} [...] "taqiya" [...] {{does not apply}} <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> fatwa by Khamenei is a primary {{religious}} order and not a secondary one. According to him, Khamenei's fatwa bans massacre of innocent people {{and this is not}} going to change in any situations because it is a primary order. Also, he said that Islamic Jurists have banned deception in Jihad and war, i.e., Islamic leader respects by any commitment he accepts.|$|E
2500|$|Further complicating this is {{a feature}} of unknown {{structure}} and origin, the Olympic-Wallowa Lineament (OWL). This is a seemingly accidental alignment of topographic features that runs roughly east-southeast from {{the north side of}} the Olympic Peninsula to the Wallowa Mountains in northeastern Oregon. It aligns with the West Coast fault and Queen Charlotte Fault system of strike-slip fault zones (similar to the San Andreas Fault in California) on the west side of Vancouver Island, but does not itself show any significant or through-going strike-slip movement. It is of interest <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>the</b> various strands of the Seattle Fault change orientation where they appear to cross the OWL, and various other features, such as the Rosedale monocline and Olympia structure, and a great many local topographical features, have parallel alignments. It may also be the original location of the Darrington—Devils Mountain Fault (the dashed line [...] "X" [...] at the top of the following map). The OWL appears to be a deep-seated structure over which the shallower crust of the Puget Lowland is being pushed, but this remains speculative.|$|E
