25|$|In a {{study by}} Føllesdal, the MSCEIT test results of 111 {{business}} leaders were compared with how their employees described their leader. It was {{found that there were}} no correlations between a leader's test results and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> was rated by the employees, with regard to empathy, ability to motivate, and leader effectiveness. Føllesdal also criticized the Canadian company Multi-Health Systems, which administers the MSCEIT test. The test contains 141 questions but it was found after publishing the test that 19 of these did not give the expected answers. This has led Multi-Health Systems to remove answers to these 19 questions before scoring but without stating this officially.|$|E

2500|$|The {{tension between}} {{tradition}} and modern pressures {{in relation to}} marriage—and, by extension, within Japanese culture as a whole—is {{one of the major}} conflicts Ozu portrays in the film. Sorensen indicates by several examples that what foods a character eats or even <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> sits down (e.g., on tatami mats or Western-style chairs) reveals the relationship of that character to tradition. According to Peña, Noriko [...] "is the quintessential moga—modan gaaru, 'modern girl'—that populates Japanese fiction, and really the Japanese imagination, beginning in the 1920s onward." [...] Throughout most of the film, Noriko wears Western clothing rather than a kimono, and outwardly behaves in up-to-date ways. However, Bordwell asserts that [...] "Noriko is more old-fashioned than her father, insisting that he could not get along without her and resenting the idea that a widower might remarry… she clings to an outmoded notion of propriety." ...|$|E

2500|$|For each project, {{the member}} prepares and {{delivers}} {{a speech in}} front of the club. Speakers are expected to keep their presentations within prescribed time limits. For most Competent Communication speeches, the limit is five to seven minutes. [...] The Icebreaker (CC Manual, Project 1) is between 46 minutes. While some Advanced communication projects are five to seven minutes, some are shorter and most are longer, generally ten to fifteen minutes, and some are a half an hour or more. After the member gives the presentation, another Toastmaster evaluates the presenter based on the criteria for each project. The distinctive feature of Toastmasters is this continual evaluation. Each activity at a club is evaluated: speeches are evaluated both orally at the meeting and in the member's manual. In some clubs, even the evaluators are themselves evaluated {{at the end of the}} meeting by a [...] "General Evaluator", also a club member. This near-immediate feedback provides the member with information on <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> can improve his or her presentation skills for the next speech and is intended to provide a positive experience for the speaker.|$|E

"Then," [...] he continues, [...] "you can comment {{upon the}} hardihood of the Bavarian peasant. <b>How</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> walks about bare-headed and bare-footed through the fiercest showers, {{and seems to}} find the rain only pleasantly cooling. How, during the {{performance}} of the Passion Play, they act and sing and stand about upon the uncovered stage without taking the slightest notice of the downpour of water that is soaking their robes and running from their streaming hair, to make great pools upon the boards; and how the audience, in the cheaper, unroofed portion of the theatre, sit with equal stoicism, watching them, no one ever dreaming even of putting up an umbrella--or, if he does dream of doing so, experiencing a very rude awakening from the sticks of those behind." ...|$|E
60|$|After {{a careful}} perusal of 'Twixt Love and Duty, by Mr. Tighe Hopkins, we confess {{ourselves}} unable to inform anxious inquirers {{who it is}} that is thus sandwiched, and <b>how</b> <b>he</b> (<b>or</b> <b>she)</b> got into so unpleasant a predicament. The curious reader {{with a taste for}} enigmas may be advised to find out for himself--if he can. Even if he be unsuccessful, his trouble will be repaid by the pleasant writing and clever character drawing of Mr. Hopkins's tale. The plot is less praiseworthy. The whole Madeira episode seems to lead up to this dilemma, and after all it comes to nothing. We brace up our nerves for a tragedy and are treated instead to the mildest of marivaudage--which is disappointing. In conclusion, one word of advice to Mr. Hopkins: let him refrain from apostrophising his characters after this fashion: 'Oh, Gilbert Reade, what are you about that you dally with this golden chance?' and so forth. This {{is one of the worst}} mannerisms of a bygone generation of story tellers.|$|E

6000|$|At {{the time}} of this volume going to press the results {{obtained}} by clients of this medium have been forty-two successes out of fifty attempts, checked and docketted by the author. This series forms a most conclusive proof of spirit clairvoyance. An attempt has been made by Mr. E. F. Benson, who examined some of the letters, to explain the results upon the grounds of telepathy. He admits that [...] "The tastes, appearance and character of the deceased are often given, and many names are introduced by the medium, some not traceable, but most of them identical with relations or friends." [...] Such an admission would alone banish thought-reading as an explanation, for there is no evidence in existence to show that this power ever reaches such perfection that one who possesses it could draw the image of a dead man from your brain, fit a correct name to him, and then associate him with all sorts of definite and detailed actions in which he was engaged. Such an explanation is not an explanation but a pretence. But even if one were to allow such a theory to pass, there are numerous incidents in these accounts which could not be explained in such a fashion, where unknown details have been given which were afterwards verified, and even where mistakes in thought upon the part of the sitter were corrected by the medium under spirit guidance. Personally I believe that the medium's own account of how she gets her remarkable results is the absolute truth, and I can imagine no other fashion in which they can be explained. She has, of course, her bad days, and the conditions are always worst when there is an inquisitorial rather than a religious atmosphere in the interview. This intermittent character of the results is, according to my experience, characteristic of spirit clairvoyance as compared with thought-reading, which can, in its more perfect form, become almost automatic within certain marked limits. I may add that the constant practice of some psychical researchers to take no notice at all of the medium's own account of <b>how</b> <b>he</b> <b>or</b> <b>she</b> attains results, but to substitute some complicated and unproved explanation of their own, is as insulting as it is unreasonable. It has been alleged as a slur upon Mrs. B's results and character that she has been twice prosecuted by the police. This is, in fact, not a slur upon the medium but rather upon the law, which is in so barbarous a condition that the true seer fares no better than the impostor, and that no definite psychic principles are recognised. A medium may under such circumstances be a martyr rather than a criminal, and a conviction ceases to be a stain upon the character.|$|E
