Currently, the main streams of commercially available machines use the point or line forming method to create the solid part. A thin polymeric material layer is delivered by a roller or scraper to form a thin material layer for further layer forming. This process won’t be able to control the size of the forming part. In this paper, “Liquid Spray Process ” is proposed to use a spray pen to spread a thin layer of polymeric material on the <b>forming</b> <b>bed</b> for further layer forming in a rapid prototyping system. It will decrease time and cost of the current R. P. machines by spreading proper size of thin <b>forming</b> <b>bed.</b> The setup of the system of the automatic spray pen, continuous material supply system, spray parameter settings and man-machine interface control system were discussed in this paper. Furthermore, the Taguchi Methods were applied to find the optimal spray forming parameters including height, velocity, acceleration, control air pressure, atomizing air pressure, fluid flow of spray, material pressure and speed of gear pump. Finally, the minimum uniform coating thickness could reach as low as 25 µm with “Liquid Spray Process ” when the optimal parameters were used. The uniformity could be well maintained for both sprays in cross or in parallel directions to form an area of 120 mm × 150 mm with the optimal parameters...|$|E

The initial artificially made <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> were out of equilibrium with the flow field. Temporal evolution of <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> was monitored using time-lapse photography in order to characterize <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> adjustment to the imposed flow. Velocity measurements were collected using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter to characterize both mean flow and turbulence associated with different <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> geometries. Sandy <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> all had identical initial geometries; however, the initial distance between <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> crests was varied between experiments. Overall deformation of the bed varied {{as a function of}} initial <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> spacing; however, <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> evolved unpredictably as periods of relatively slow change were punctuated by periods of rapidly changing geometry. Subtle changes in <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> trough geometry were found to have a strong influence on turbulence and therefore sediment transport.

40|$|This study {{examines}} tide-dependent {{variations in the}} formation and dynamics of suspended sediment patterns coupled to mean flow and turbulence above asymmetric <b>bed</b> <b>forms.</b> In the Danish Knudedyb inlet, very large primary <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> remain ebb-oriented during a tidal cycle while smaller superimposed <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> reverse direction with each tidal phase. Hydroacoustic in situ observations reveal pronounced differences in suspended sediment transport patterns between tidal phases caused by the relative orientation of primary <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> and the mean tidal flow and flow unsteadiness during a single tidal phase. When flow and primary <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> orientation are aligned, water-depth-scale macroturbulence develops in the <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> lee-sides {{in the presence of}} flow separation. Macroturbulent flow structures occur at high flow stages and are coupled to increased amounts of sediment in suspension. When flow and <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> orientation are opposed no evidence of flow separation associated with primary <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> is found. Sediment-laden macroturbulence at high flow velocities is of a smaller scale and attributed to the superimposed secondary <b>bed</b> <b>forms.</b> The flow structures are advected along the primary <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> stoss-side (temporary hydraulic lee-side). The steep primary <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> lee-side (temporary hydraulic stoss-side) however, limits transport capabilities beyond the scale of primary <b>bed</b> <b>forms...</b>|$|R
40|$|Field and {{laboratory}} {{studies indicate that}} changes in riverbed morphology often lag changes in water discharge. This lagged response produces hysteresis {{in the relationship between}} water discharge and <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> geometry. To understand these phenomena, we performed flume experiments to observe the response of a sand bed to step increases and decreases in water discharge. For an abrupt rise in discharge, we observed that <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> grew rapidly by collision and merger of <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> migrating with different celerities. Growth rate slowed as <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> approached equilibrium with the higher discharge regime. After an abrupt discharge drop, <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> decay occurred through formation of smaller secondary <b>bed</b> <b>forms,</b> in equilibrium with the lower discharge, which cannibalized the original, relict features. We present a simple model framework to quantitatively predict time scales of <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> adjustment to flow changes, based on equilibrium <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> heights, lengths, and celerities at low and high flows. For rising discharge, the model assumes that all <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> collisions result in irreversible merger, due to a dispersion of initial celerities. For falling discharge, we derive a diffusion model for the decay of relict high-stage features. Our models predict the form and time scale of experimental <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> adjustments. Additional experiments applying slow and fast triangular flood waves show that <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> hysteresis occurs only when the time scale of flow change is faster than the modeled (and measured) <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> adjustment time. We show that our predicted adjustment time scales {{can also be used to}} predict the occurrence of <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> hysteresis in natural floods...|$|R
40|$|Based on the <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> {{control factor}} {{theory and the}} {{existing}} flume experimental data, the correspondence between values taken by the control factor and different <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> configurations is analyzed. A <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> parameters including the particle Froude number and the relative depth (ratio of depth to median diameter of sediment particle) are proposed. In addition, a computational method {{on the basis of}} simplified control factor m, and its scope of application are introduced. The adaptability of the relationship between <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> control factor and the <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> parameter is discussed. With the relationship and the characteristics of <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> movement observed in the lower reach of Yellow River, a method to discriminate <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> is established. The study suggests that the flow resistance characteristics in upper and lower flow regimes can be described by the control factor m, and the relationship between the control factor m and the <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> parameter exists not only in the laboratory flume experiments but also in the natural river systems. The preliminarily test of the established method to discriminate various <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> phases is done using the field observations.

The influence of the <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> length and height on the total bed shear stress and energy slope is deliberated, and empirical expressions for the length of the separation zone behind the <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> are also proposed.

Although aeolian <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> should be observed at all elevations on Venus, their optimum expression {{is compatible with the}} lowest elevations where atmospheric pressure is greatest. Their development is relatively unhindered by the presence of dense grains, the lack of sorting in source sediment from which they form, or the addition of cohesive dust. Small (about 10 cm) <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> are efficient in sorting materials either by density or particle size.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of sedimentary strata records {{the dynamics of}} the surfaces that produced them. Cross strata {{are one of the most}} common features preserved in the stratigraphic record and are typically formed by migrating ripples, dunes, and bars.

The surface kinematics is characterized by the migration (translation of the waveforms) and deformation (change in shape of the waveforms) of the <b>bed</b> <b>forms.</b> We show that, for transverse, unidirectional <b>bed</b> <b>forms,</b> the local slope and curvature of the preserved stratigraphic boundaries depend on the competition between migration and deformation of the <b>bed</b> <b>forms.</b> Further, we show that deformation is the sole cause of curved cross-set boundaries and define a quantitative relationship between the curvature of the bounding surfaces of the preserved cross sets and the deformation rate of the <b>bed</b> <b>forms.</b> The theoretical results compare well with experimental data of subaqueous, transverse <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> evolution under equilibrium, steady state conditions with no net deposition...|$|R

The turbulence associated with flow separation that develops over their steep lee side {{is responsible for}} the form shear stress which can represent a substantial part of total shear stress in rivers. This paper uses the Delft 3 D modeling system to investigate the effects of <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> geometry and forcing conditions on flow separation length and associated turbulence, and <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> shear stress over angle-of-repose (30 lee side angle) <b>bed</b> <b>forms.</b> The model was validated with lab measurements that showed sufficient agreement to be used for a systematic analysis. The influence of flow velocity, bed roughness, relative height (<b>bed</b> <b>form</b> height/water depth), and aspect ratio (<b>bed</b> <b>form</b> height/length) on the variations of the normalized length of the flow separation zone, the extent of the wake region (where the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) was more than 70 % of the maximum TKE), the average TKE within the wake region and the form shear stress were investigated. Form shear stress was found not to scale with the size of the flow separation zone but {{to be related to the}} product of the normalized extent of the wake region (extent of the wake region/extent of water body above the <b>bed</b> <b>form)</b> and the average TKE within the wake region.

This Coastal and Hydraulics Engineer Technical Note (CHETN) is concerned with large <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> that chronically or periodically encroach on the authorized navigation depth. Smaller <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> have been observed in many (perhaps most) other inlets, but {{because they do not}} hinder navigation, they are not discussed in this CHETN.

BACKGROUND: Large <b>bed</b> <b>forms,</b> as depicted in Figure 1, are called either sand waves or medium-to-large dunes. They have been documented to pose a navigation hazard if they extend about 1 m or higher above the channel floor (Ashley 1990; Boothroyd and Hubbard 1974).

The modelling of river processes involves numerous uncertainties, resulting in uncertain model results. Knowledge of the type and magnitude of these uncertainties is crucial for a meaningful interpretation of the model results. Uncertainty in the hydraulic roughness due to <b>bed</b> <b>forms</b> {{is one of the}} main contributors to the uncertainty in the modelled water levels. The aim of this study was to quantify the uncertainty in the <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> roughness under design conditions and quantify the effect on the design water levels in the Dutch river Waal. Five roughness models that predict <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> roughness based on measured <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> and flow characteristics were extrapolated to design conditions. The results show that the 95 % confidence interval of the predicted Nikuradse roughness values under design conditions ranges from 0. 32 to 1. 03 [*]m. This uncertainty was propagated through the two-dimensional hydrodynamic model, WAQUA, by means of a Monte Carlo simulation for an idealized schematization of the Dutch river Waal. The uncertain <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> roughness results in an uncertainty in the design water levels, with a 95 % confidence interval of 0. 53 [*]m, which is significant for Dutch river management practice. The uncertainty in the <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> roughness was mainly caused by a lack of knowledge about the physical process of <b>bed</b> <b>form</b> evolution that causes roughness.
