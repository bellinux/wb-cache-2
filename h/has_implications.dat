5|$|If truly a gondwanathere, TNM02067 {{extends the}} known {{geographic}} {{range of the}} group {{to another part of}} Gondwana, the African mainland. The uncertain age of locality TZ-07 renders a precise assessment of the significance of TNM02067 difficult. It may well be older than the oldest previously known gondwanathere, the Campanian Gondwanatherium. It also <b>has</b> <b>implications</b> for the hypothesis that Africa was isolated from the rest of Gondwana from an early dateas early as the early Cretaceousand consequently had a fauna distinct from the rest of Gondwana for much of the Cretaceous, as it may be closely related to the sudamericids of South America, India, Madagascar, and Antarctica, a highly derived group.|$|E

International flights often require a higher level of physical security than do domestic airports, although in recent years, many countries have adopted the same level of security for both.|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanism}} of prion replication <b>has</b> <b>implications</b> for designing drugs. Since the incubation period of prion diseases is so long, an effective drug {{does not need}} to eliminate all prions, but simply needs to slow down the rate of exponential growth. Models predict that {{the most effective way to}} achieve this, using a drug with the lowest possible dose, is to find a drug that binds to fibril ends and blocks them from growing any further.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect <b>has</b> <b>implications</b> for real-life decisions. In the lab, people disproportionately favor brands matching their initials. An analysis of a large database of charity donations revealed that a disproportionately large number of people donate to disaster relief following hurricanes with names sharing their initial letter (e.g. Kate and Kevin following Hurricane Katrina). Studies that investigate the impact of name-letter matching on bigger life decisions (where to live, whom to marry, which occupation to take on) are controversial.|$|E

5|$|There is some {{evidence}} that the effect <b>has</b> <b>implications</b> for real-life decisions. One lab study revealed an increase in a favourable attitude towards prices when they were secretly manipulated to match subjects’ birthday dates, thus resulting in a higher chance of purchase. However a second study using birth year as price did not lead to the same result. A study of the liking of products found that participants with high self-esteem liked products better if the product names unknowingly involved their birthday number and letters of their name. Some field research into the impact of the birthday-number effect on bigger life decisions (e.g. where to live) is controversial.|$|E
5|$|Attachment theory <b>has</b> <b>implications</b> in {{residence}} and contact disputes, and applications by foster parents to adopt foster children. In the past, particularly in North America, the main theoretical framework was psychoanalysis. Increasingly attachment theory has replaced it, thus {{focusing on the}} quality and continuity of caregiver relationships rather than economic well-being or automatic precedence of any one party, such as the biological mother. Rutter noted that in the UK, since 1980, family courts have shifted considerably to recognize the complications of attachment relationships. Children tend to have attachment relationships with both parents and often grandparents or other relatives. Judgements need to take this into account along {{with the impact of}} step-families. Attachment theory has been crucial in highlighting the importance of social relationships in dynamic rather than fixed terms.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} impact of the common cold is not well understood in much of the world. In the United States, the common cold leads to 75–100 million physician visits annually at a conservative cost estimate of $7.7 billion per year. Americans spend $2.9 billion on over-the-counter drugs and another $400 million on prescription medicines for symptom relief. More than one-third of people who saw a doctor received an antibiotic prescription, which <b>has</b> <b>implications</b> for antibiotic resistance. An estimated 22–189 million school days are missed annually due to a cold. As a result, parents missed 126 million workdays to stay home to care for their children. When added to the 150 million workdays missed by employees suffering from a cold, the total {{economic impact}} of cold-related work loss exceeds $20 billion per year. This accounts for 40% of time lost from work in the United States.|$|E

5|$|Three {{channels}} facilitate lymphatic drainage {{from the}} cervix. The anterior and lateral cervix drains to nodes along the uterine arteries, travelling along the cardinal ligaments {{at the base}} of the broad ligament to the external iliac lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes. The posterior and lateral cervix drains along the uterine arteries to the internal iliac lymph nodes and ultimately the paraaortic lymph nodes, and the posterior section of the cervix drains to the obturator and presacral lymph nodes. However, there are variations as lymphatic drainage from the cervix travels to different sets of pelvic nodes in some people. This <b>has</b> <b>implications</b> in scanning nodes for involvement in cervical cancer.|$|E
5|$|Whether Smilodon {{was sexually}} dimorphic <b>has</b> <b>implications</b> for its {{reproductive}} behavior. Based on their conclusions that Smilodon fatalis had no sexual dimorphism, Van Valkenburgh and Sacco (2002) suggested that, if the cats were social, they {{would likely have}} lived in monogamous pairs (along with offspring) with no intense competition among males for females. Likewise, Meachen-Samuels and Binder (2010) concluded that aggression between males was less pronounced in S.fatalis than in the American lion. Christiansen and Harris (2012) found that, as S.fatalis did exhibit some sexual dimorphism, {{there would have been}} evolutionary selection for competition between males. The structure of the hyoid bones suggest that Smilodon communicated by roaring, like modern big cats.|$|E
5|$|Drugs {{function}} by binding {{to specific}} locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a conformational change. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, {{it is difficult}} to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current in silico methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculations. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and evaluate their efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (Å) root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy <b>has</b> <b>implications</b> to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins. Scientists have used Folding@home to research drug resistance by studying vancomycin, an antibiotic drug of last resort, and beta-lactamase, a protein that can break down antibiotics like penicillin.|$|E

5|$|Mu {{waves are}} thought to be {{indicative}} of an infant’s developing ability to imitate. This is important because the ability to imitate plays a vital {{role in the development of}} motor skills, tool use, and understanding causal information through social interaction. Mimicking is integral in the development of social skills and understanding nonverbal cues. Causal relationships can be made through social learning without requiring experience firsthand. In action execution, mu waves are present in both infants and adults before and after the execution of a motor task and its accompanying desynchronization. While executing a goal-oriented action, however, infants exhibit a higher degree of desynchronization than do adults. Just as with an action execution, during action observation infants’ mu waves not only show a desynchronization, but show a desynchronization greater in degree than the one evidenced in adults. This tendency for changes in degree of desynchronization, rather than actual changes in frequency, becomes the measure for mu wave development throughout adulthood, although the most changes take place during the first year of life. Understanding the mechanisms that are shared between action perception and execution in the earliest years of life <b>has</b> <b>implications</b> for language development. Learning and understanding through social interaction comes from imitating movements as well as vowel sounds. Sharing the experience of attending to an object or event with another person can be a powerful force in the development of language.|$|E
