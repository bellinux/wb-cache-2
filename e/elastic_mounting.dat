40|$|In the {{prediction}} of active vibration isolation performance, control force requirements were ignored in previous work. This may limit the realization of theoretically predicted isolation performance if control force of large magnitude cannot be supplied by actuators. The behavior of a feed-forward active isolation system subjected to actuator output constraints is investigated. Distributed parameter models are developed to analyze the system response, and to produce a transfer matrix {{for the design of}} an integrated passive-active isolation system. Cost functions comprising a combination of the vibration transmission energy and the sum of the squared control forces are proposed. The example system considered is a rigid body connected to a simply supported plate via two passive-active isolation mounts. Vertical and transverse forces as well as a rotational moment are applied at the rigid body, and resonances excited in <b>elastic</b> <b>mounts</b> and the supporting plate are analyzed. The overall isolation performance is evaluated by numerical simulation. The simulation results are then compared with those obtained using unconstrained control strategies. In addition, the effects of waves in <b>elastic</b> <b>mounts</b> are analyzed. It is shown that the control strategies which rely on unconstrained actuator outputs may give substantial power transmission reductions over a wide frequency range, but also require large control force amplitudes to control excited vibration modes of the system. Expected power transmission reductions for modified control strategies that incorporate constrained actuator outputs are considerably less than typical reductions with unconstrained actuator outputs. In the frequency range in which rigid body modes are present, the control strategies can only achieve 5 – 10 dB power transmission reduction, when control forces are constrained to be the same order of the magnitude as the primary vertical force. The resonances of the <b>elastic</b> <b>mounts</b> result in a notable increase of power transmission in high frequency range and cannot be attenuated by active control. The investigation provides a guideline for design and evaluation of active vibration isolation systems. Lingling Sun, Wei Sun, Kongjie Song, Colin H. Hanse...|$|R

In the work described in this thesis, the use of stiffening elements to decrease low-frequency noise transmission through lightweight panels was explored. The effect of <b>elastic</b> <b>mounting</b> as a possible contributor to low-frequency noise transmission was also considered. A finite element model allowing for both panel stiffening from clamping {{and the addition of}} variable-stiffness beams within the panel was constructed. The model allows for variable positioning of such elements as part of a stiffened panel configuration. Several double-panel configurations, representing double-pane windows typically seen in energy-efficient constructions were also tested with various clamped-stiffening elements. The change in panel vibration was also gauged {{through the use of a}} Rayleigh-Ritz model that allowed for construction of the modes of vibration of stiffened panels. In addition to the FEM and Rayleigh-Ritz models, experimental sound transmission loss testing of panels with variable edge stiffness was performed to verify the character of the predictions seen in the models.

Electrical {{equipment}} such as switchboard {{should be}} protected from the seismic hazard to enable stable electric power supply even after the earthquake, since its seismic damage results in the severe damage such as social chaos, fire, and explosion.

Since most of these systems contain one or more controlled axes, which are often designed for high bandwidth and high accuracy, the mechanical design process is mainly focused on obtaining a lightweight and stiff design. With respect to the dynamic properties of mechanical systems (mass, stiffness and damping), damping {{is by far the most}} difficult to model. In addition, material damping properties are frequency and temperature dependent, and so, damping is often not implemented beforehand, but only after the negative effects of undamped resonance frequencies have become painfully visible in practice. The research work that was done together with the Eindhoven University of Technology shows that the incorporation of damping with negligible virtual play is quite straightforward and highly advantageous to the overall optimization process of the design. It is emphasized that high stiffness and high damping are each necessary, and not individually sufficient requirements for high precision machines and instruments. Two patent applied design proposals were made and investigated analytically to implement viscoelastic damping in metal leaf springs, both based on constrained layers. Compared to material damping in metals, for which the loss factor is typically in the order of 10 - 3 to 10 - 4 [-], the loss factor is increased to up to even 40 %, depending on the direction (axial or lateral) and the application (elastic mechanism or kinematic <b>elastic</b> <b>mount).</b> Consequently, the response function X/F a...|$|R

The double panel material and geometrical properties have been chosen so as to emulate section of an aircraft fuselage, or bodywork of a vehicle. It consists of two plates: an aluminium plate simply supported along all the edges and a honeycomb plate with all the edges free. The two plates, having the same length and width, are connected using <b>elastic</b> <b>mounts,</b> so that a double panel with a thin rectangular cavity between the plates is formed. Since the two plates are linked by the mounting system, and since the air is confined in the cavity between them, they form a structurally and acoustically coupled system. The sound transmission properties of the system are studied {{in such a way that}} the aluminium plate (“source panel”) is excited using a plane acoustic wave, while the honeycomb plate (“radiating panel”) radiates sound into free field. The aim of the active control is to reduce the sound transmitted in a broad frequency band, but with a particular focus on the reduction of the sound transmission at lower frequencies of the band. Decentralised velocity feedback control systems (applying active damping) are implemented, with purpose of reducing sound transmission at resonance frequencies. Control sensors and actuators are embedded into the double plate system as a regular array, so that a smart double panel is created. The theoretical study includes analysis of the passive sound transmission in terms of a parametric study, implementation of the active control using skyhook velocity sensors and skyhook force actuators, and the performance/stability analysis in case when reactive actuators and skyhook velocity sensors are used. In the latter case the actuating force is obtained using actuators located in the air cavity which can react off the two plate...|$|R
