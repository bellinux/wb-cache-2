She had gone with Kennicott and Aunt Bessie to the supper, which was spread on oilcloth-covered and trestle-supported tables in the church basement.

5000|$|After the Civil Rights Act, {{the group}} lost {{momentum}} and power. Meetings became less frequent and money stopped coming in. (Forman writes: [...] "By 1965 the Council on United Civil Rights Leadership was raising {{less and less}} money while trying to inflict {{more and more of}} its conservative positions on the movement.") Division over U.S. warfare in Southeast Asia increased tension to the breaking point. [...] "Johnson needs a consensus. If we are not with him on Vietnam then he is not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> on civil rights", said Young. Leaders of SNCC and CORE (as well as King, though perhaps not the rest of the SCLC) disagreed strenuously.|$|E

50|$|Corporation like Northern Telecom, General Electric, and Data General {{have adopted}} pay bands to promote teaming and lateral {{development}} {{to take away}} from hierarchical movement within the workplace.

5000|$|Graham has {{expressed}} inclusivist views, suggesting that people without explicit faith in Jesus can be saved. In a 1997 interview with Robert Schuller, Graham said I think that everybody that loves or knows Christ, {{whether they are}} conscious of it or not, they {{are members of the}} body of Christ... God is calling people out of the world for his name, whether they come from the Muslim world, or the Buddhist world or the non-believing world, they are members of the Body of Christ because they have been called by God. They may not know the name of Jesus but they know in their hearts that they need something they do not have, and they turn to the only light they have, and I think that they are saved and they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> in heaven.|$|E
5000|$|In February 1978, Castellano made an {{agreement}} between the Gambino family and the Westies, an Irish-American gang from Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan. Castellano wanted hitmen that law enforcement could not tie directly to the Gambino family. The Westies wanted Gambino protection from the other Cosa Nostra families. The Gambino-Westie alliance was set in a meeting between Westies leader James Coonan and Castellano. According to Westies gangster Mickey Featherstone, Castellano gave them the following directive:You guys got to stop acting like cowboys - acting wild. You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> now. If anyone {{is going to get}} killed, you have to clear it with us. [...] Castellano also created an alliance with the Cherry Hill Gambinos, a group of Sicilian heroin importers and distributors in New Jersey, also for use as gunmen. With the Westies and the Cherry Hill Gambinos, Castellano commanded a small army of capable killers.|$|E
40|$|The US {{policy on}} the {{disposition}} of weapons and commercial plutonium by geologic storage is examined and compared with destruction in reactors or accelerator-driven systems. The close coupling with Russian weapons plutonium is considered. Strong {{emphasis is placed on}} the preference by terrorists and rogue states for commercial plutonium over weapons plutonium for fast and simple nuclear weapons acquisition. US policy faces now the issue of whether the plutonium is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> essentially ``forever`` or whether several technical options for total destruction will be supported. Accelerator-driven transmutation technology is proposed as a safe, affordable, and complete solution to this problem...|$|E

[...] "We wanted {{to start with a}} clean slate because the last couple of records felt kind of compromised", said Foreman concerning the period the band had with Columbia Records after 2003's The Beautiful Letdown. He describes the time period with their former label as one filled with personnel turnover, which eventually led to their departure from Sony because [...] "we wanted to create an environment where we <b>were</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> the same people {{for a long time and}} trust is established." ...|$|R

40|$|At {{an earlier}} {{research}} seminar, Dr. John Seubert observed that available evi¬dence indicated the red-winged blackbird was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>with</b> <b>us</b> for some time, and perhaps we 2 ̆ 7 d better learn to 2 ̆ 2 live with it. 2 ̆ 2 Whereupon {{a representative of}} the com growers said if Dr. Seubert really believed that, he 2 ̆ 7 d better look for a new job. I sincerely hope this attitude is not too widespread among corn producers and market¬ers; because if it is, we can expect a lot of pressure designed to force scientists to abandon their search for a safe method of reducing redwing damage. 2 ̆ 2 Risk now, find out later 2 ̆ 2 has been the guiding policy of pesticide makers, merchants, and control operators for some 30 years. I submit that this policy has cost the consumer and taxpayer far more than if DDT, and most other hard pesti¬cides, had never been discovered. Yesterday, when the evidence against persistent chemicals was not all in, risk-now-find-out-later advocates may have had some slight excuse for continuing their policy. Today, the evidence is in, - it is conclusive - there is no excuse (unless blinded by greed) for pursuing this suicidal course. Whether attempting to control mosquitoes, red-wings, or the most recent outbreak of corn blight, if risk now-find-out-later does not die soon, then we can expect a lot of sick and dying people within the decade. We already have a lot of sick and dying people as a result of environmental pollution. No one denies this. So, there is scant excuse for adding one more bird poison to the land unless and until we are certain of its side effects...|$|E

In reviewing Deftones, Stephen Thomas Erlewine wrote that [...] "Hexagram", the album's opener, [...] "hits hard—harder than they ever have, revealing how mushy Staind is, or how toothless Linkin Park is". He also went on to say, however, that the album [...] "sticks a little too close to familiar territory". The A.V. Club similarly called the album [...] "less rewarding than its predecessor, though its peaks rival any in the genre".|$|R
