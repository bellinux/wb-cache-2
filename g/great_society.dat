5|$|In 1966, {{criticism}} {{over the}} Johnson Administration's {{handling of the}} Vietnam War began to grow, with Ford and Congressional Republicans expressing concern that the United States was not doing what was necessary to win the war. Public sentiment also began to move against Johnson, and the 1966 midterm elections saw a 47-seat swing {{in favor of the}} Republicans. This was not enough to give Republicans a majority in the House, but the victory gave Ford the opportunity to prevent the passage of further <b>Great</b> <b>Society</b> programs.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Nixon {{took office in}} 1969, {{inflation}} was at 4.7percentâ€”its highest rate since the Korean War. The <b>Great</b> <b>Society</b> had been enacted under Johnson, which, together with the Vietnam War costs, was causing large budget deficits. Unemployment was low, but interest rates were at their highest in a century. Nixon's major economic goal was to reduce inflation; the most obvious means of doing so was to end the war. This could not be accomplished overnight, and the U.S. economy continued to struggle through 1970, contributing to a lackluster Republican performance in the midterm congressional elections (Democrats controlled both Houses of Congress throughout Nixon's presidency). According to political economist Nigel Bowles in his 2011 study of Nixon's economic record, the new president did little to alter Johnson's policies through {{the first year of}} his presidency.|$|E
25|$|In {{the congressional}} {{elections}} of 1966, the Republicans gained three {{seats in the}} Senate and 47 in the House, reinvigorating the conservative coalition and {{making it more difficult}} for Johnson to pass any additional <b>Great</b> <b>Society</b> legislation. However, in the end Congress passed almost 96 percent of the administration's <b>Great</b> <b>Society</b> programs, which Johnson then signed into law.|$|E

[...] The oriental-sounding [...] "Daydream-Nightmare-Love" [...] and the darkly psychedelic [...] "Born to Be Burned" [...] are also included. [...] "Someone to Love" [...] is arguably The <b>Great</b> <b>Society's</b> most famous song, due to the later hit single version by Jefferson Airplane (retitled [...] "Somebody to Love"). [...] The <b>Great</b> <b>Society's</b> vocalist, Grace Slick, joined Jefferson Airplane in late 1966 and consequently she sings lead vocal on the Airplane's recording of the song, which became a Top 5 hit in the U.S. in May 1967.|$|R

To Tucker, their eloquent writings speak for themselves, and are testament to a high minded civic morality.|$|E

40|$|Claiming that {{interest}} in local vs. foreign news {{is one way}} of measuring orientation towards local and <b>greater</b> <b>society,</b> this paper utilizes a Norwegian survey with questions about interest in news to identify groups with different orientations. The study builds on Mertonâ€™s (1949) local/cosmopolitan dichotomy, but takes this further by claiming that rather than two, there are four different ways of orienting oneself towards local and <b>greater</b> <b>society</b> on the basis of local/foreign news interest. The author suggests that a categorizing of individuals into either â€˜localsâ€™, â€˜cosmopolitansâ€™, â€˜local cosmopolitansâ€™ or the â€˜disconnectedâ€™ is a more fruitful way of dealing with this matter. The results show that gender, age, education and ties to oneâ€™s domicile may help explain which type of individual constitutes each of the four categories. Comparing traditional media with the Internet, the study shows that the level of interest in news on the Internet is generally lower, but that the patterns tied to the traditional media are transferred relatively unchanged to the Internet...|$|R
