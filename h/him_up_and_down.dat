500|$|As Commissioner, Heaphy's {{role was}} to {{administer}} native reserves set aside {{by the government and}} to determine areas of land that could be opened to migrants. His work took <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the country, inspecting land and negotiating with Māori landowners, a process he did not always enjoy. He still advocated for aggrieved Māori, whose land had been stolen by colonials. An added stress in Heaphy's first year as Commissioner, was an enquiry into his conduct during the period he was [...] "Chief Surveyor to the General Government of New Zealand" [...] and working in the Waikato. Allegations had been raised that he took bribes, for illegally adjusting land boundaries. The enquiry cleared Heaphy of corruption although he was criticised for taking payments from young trainee surveyors, in return for work. In 1872, he and his wife moved to Wellington, which was more centrally located and thus convenient for his work, which now included an appointment as 'Trust Commissioner for the Wellington District', dealing with land fraud.|$|E

6000|$|... "Artful 'Arry {{went down}} the companion-ladder very quiet, and then stood {{at the foot of}} it looking at Uncle Dick. He looked <b>'im</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> all over, and then 'e gave a fierce, loud cough.|$|R
60|$|He did {{not reply}} for a moment but looked all around <b>him,</b> <b>and</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> as though he {{expected}} to find some inspiration for an answer.|$|R
60|$|Taking the scout's arm {{he paced}} with <b>him</b> slowly <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the yard, while Dick and Mary {{went off on}} a cruise elsewhere.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Lidgett looked <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> and, {{being an}} artist, understood.|$|E
60|$|VIVIE [who {{has been}} looking <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> sharply] If you like.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{turned and}} looked <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> with her {{wondering}} blue eyes.|$|E
60|$|Vane frowned {{but made}} no answer; and Carroll, {{recognizing}} that his comrade was {{not inclined to}} be communicative, left <b>him</b> pacing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The rest of {{his career}} saw <b>him</b> {{bouncing}} <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> between the minors and majors, spending only one season in the majors for the entire year: [...]|$|R
6000|$|... "The skipper told {{me about}} it ten minutes arter they was made snug in the inner berth 'ere. He walked <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> like a man with a raging toothache, <b>and</b> arter follering <b>'im</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the wharf till I was tired out, I {{discovered}} that 'is father-in-law 'ad got 'imself mixed up with a widder-woman ninety years old and weighing twenty stun. Arter he 'ad cooled <b>down</b> a bit, <b>and</b> I 'ad given 'im a few little pats on the shoulder, 'e made it forty-eight years old and fourteen stun.|$|R
60|$|She looked <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> with a {{deliberate}} eye, her lip curling a little.|$|E
60|$|The old {{man looked}} <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> and then motioned {{him to take}} a seat.|$|E
60|$|She {{scoffed at}} him, looked <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> at his well-fitting clothes, his general air of prosperity.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Pierston {{showed in}} her face that she fully {{recognized}} {{the difference between a}} rich bird in hand and a young bird in the bush. She looked <b>him</b> curiously <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "What's got the Master, Mother?" [...] inquired old Robert, presently. [...] "I hear <b>him</b> striding <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> in {{his room}} 'sif he was caged. Sure you didn't lock him in by mistake?" ...|$|R
5000|$|While Hillary Clinton can’t claim {{credit for}} {{coming up with}} a duck to {{highlight}} how Donald Trump is refusing to release his tax returns, she certainly was amused watching <b>him</b> ride <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> Trump Tower’s escalator.|$|R
60|$|Tallente looked <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down.</b> The {{station master}} was {{approaching}} now, the whistle had blown, their conversation {{was at an}} end.|$|E
60|$|She looked <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> a measured, merciless survey. He was a tall, big man, but {{he seemed}} to shrink into insignificance.|$|E
60|$|Terence at once stepped forward, {{and again}} saluted. The general, whom Terence had not before met, looked <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> and then {{held out his}} hand.|$|E
60|$|They went {{on talking}} {{in the other room}} for another ten minutes, and then Mr. Parable lets them out himself, and goes a little way with them. When he came back we could hear <b>him</b> walking <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the other room.|$|R
60|$|I am {{an early}} riser, but {{my uncle was}} an even earlier one, for I found <b>him</b> pacing <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the lawn {{at the side of}} the house. He ran towards me in his eagerness when he saw me come out from the door.|$|R
60|$|The Flowers {{were quite}} indignant at his daring to intrude into their {{beautiful}} home, {{and when they}} saw <b>him</b> capering <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the walks, <b>and</b> waving his arms above his head in such a ridiculous manner, they could not restrain their feelings any longer.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes; {{they are}} walking <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> under the south wall,' said Nuttie, thankful {{that she had}} peeped under the many wraps as he was carried across the hall.|$|E
60|$|And {{with these}} {{apparently}} meaningless words {{he turned to}} the shaken Boyle and, taking his arm, began to walk <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> in the moonlight, talking in low tones.|$|E
60|$|Old Bouvet {{laughed in}} his wheezy way, until I {{had to give}} my moustachios a twirl and look <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> in a manner which brought him to reason.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not bother}} to hang it on a tree, but flung it into the underbush. And as the steady tide of packers flowed by <b>him,</b> <b>up</b> trail <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> he noted that the other tenderfeet were {{beginning}} to shed their shooting-irons.|$|R
6000|$|Burnamy fond the Bird of Prey, as he {{no longer}} had the heart to call <b>him,</b> walking <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> in his room like an eagle caught in a trap. He erected his crest {{fiercely}} enough, though, when the young fellow came in at his loudly shouted, [...] "Herein!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm sure I don't know. I watched <b>him</b> walk <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> wring his hands. And {{then he took}} a {{notebook}} {{out of his pocket and}} began to study some of the figures in it. Then Nixon came along with the auto, and he jumped in and rode off." ...|$|R
60|$|HER HUSBAND [shortly, showing ill humor for {{the first}} time] Oh, indeed. [He leaves his hearth and begins to {{approach}} Henry slowly, looking <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> with growing resentment].|$|E
60|$|He {{stared at}} me as if this {{announcement}} of his would have crushed me to the earth, but I smiled at him in my turn, and looked <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> with a twirl of my moustache.|$|E
60|$|She stared <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down,</b> and he {{felt uncomfortable}} in his spine, but {{maintained}} his air of nonchalance. Then she turned slowly on her heel, and started to walk back. The corporal went at her side.|$|E
60|$|The {{next morning}} he was again more surprised. On coming down to the breakfast-parlour, he found his uncle there before <b>him,</b> walking <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the room with {{his hands behind his}} back. As soon as George had entered, his uncle stopped his walk, and bade him shut the door.|$|R
60|$|We {{filed out}} of the hotel, Arthur Jukes leading. When I had passed through the swing-doors, I found <b>him</b> gazing perplexedly <b>up</b> <b>and</b> <b>down</b> the street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Pike, {{will you}} please go for'ard and {{interview}} this devil? Fasten <b>him</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> tie <b>him</b> <b>down</b> <b>and</b> I'll {{take a look at}} him in the morning." ...|$|R
