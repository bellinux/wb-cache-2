It was built as an extension to the Queen's Building and was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II in March 2005.|$|E
5|$|Geology is {{the science}} and study of the solid and liquid matter that {{constitutes}} the Earth.

The field is a major academic discipline, and is also important for mineral and hydrocarbon extraction, knowledge about and mitigation of natural hazards, some Geotechnical engineering fields, and understanding past climates and environments.|$|E

The new model featured a rounded exterior body shell, improved <b>dynamics</b> <b>and</b> many firsts for an Australian-built car. Also, a stronger body structure increased crash safety. The locally produced Buick-sourced V6 engine powered the Commodore range, as did the 5.0-litre Holden V8 engine, and was replaced in 1999 by the 5.7-litre LS unit.|$|E
5|$|In {{the view}} of the {{production}} team, Peggy's breast cancer was a catalyst, creating new <b>dynamics</b> <b>and</b> tensions amongst existing characters. Realism was also an issue. As a middle-aged woman, Peggy was epidemiologically at higher risk for developing breast cancer. In 2001, it was reported that Peggy's character was one of only a few media portrayals of older females to be given the disease, and source organisations have praised EastEnders for this.|$|E

Spiderland was Slint's first release on Touch and Go, and the group's only album to feature Todd Brashear.|$|E
5|$|The Angolan Civil War was notable {{due to the}} {{combination}} of Angola's violent internal <b>dynamics</b> <b>and</b> massive foreign intervention.
