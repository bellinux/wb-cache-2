5|$|A {{study from}} 2005 {{concluded}} that heat waves significantly increased in frequency, persistence and spatial {{coverage in the}} decade 1991-2000, {{when compared to the}} period between 1971–80 and 1981-90. A severe heat wave in Orissa in 1998 resulted in nearly 1300 deaths. Based on observations, heat wave related mortality <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> India prior to 2005. The 2015 Indian heat wave killed more than 2,500 people.|$|E
5|$|Glass fiber <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> {{popularity}} {{since the}} discovery that asbestos causes cancer and its subsequent removal from most products.

5|$|Literary critics {{received}} Rand's fiction {{with mixed}} reviews, and academia generally ignored or rejected her philosophy, though academic interest <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> recent decades. The Objectivist movement attempts to spread her ideas, {{both to the}} public and in academic settings. She has been a significant influence among libertarians and American conservatives.|$|E

5|$|When {{platinum}} {{was declared}} a strategic government resource during World War II, many jewelry bands were {{made out of}} palladium. As recently as September 2001, palladium was more expensive than platinum and rarely used in jewelry because of the technical difficulty of casting. Currently, the casting problem has been resolved and use in jewelry has increased because platinum <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> price while palladium decreased.|$|E
5|$|Five {{years after}} the {{pioneering}} flight of the Wright brothers on 17 December 1903, Thomas Selfridge became the first fatality of powered flight while flying as a passenger with Orville Wright during {{a demonstration of the}} Wright Model A at Fort Myer, Virginia, on 17 September 1908. Eugène Lefebvre was the first pilot killed in a power airplane in 1909, while the first fatal mid-air collision occurred on 19 June 1912, near Douai, France, killing the pilot of each aircraft. Since the deaths of these early aviation pioneers, the scale of fatal aircraft accidents <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> proportion to the size and capacity of airplanes.|$|E

5|$|In 2007, {{sales of}} spirits {{increased}} 9% {{over the previous}} year. Whiskey and vodka were the top sellers, while tequila had the largest percentage increase. Oregonian's top buy was Jack Daniel's, with 412,000 bottles sold. This was during a national spirits trend where manufacturers introduced new products and advertising aimed at young drinkers. Again in 2007, Oregon's 2.6 million adults on average drank 32 gallons of beer each, versus 4 gallons of wine and 2 gallons of spirits, but sales of beer hadn't increased like sales of spirits. The Oregon Department of Human Services reported that while drinking among 8th11th graders has fallen nationally, it <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> Oregon. The number of DUI offenses dropped between 2002 and 2005, from 25,342 to 23,455.|$|E
5|$|Mass transit {{accounts}} for 9% of total U.S. work trips. Transport of goods by rail is extensive, though relatively low numbers of passengers (approximately 31 million annually) use intercity rail to travel, {{partly because of}} the low population density throughout much of the U.S. interior. However, ridership on Amtrak, the national intercity passenger rail system, grew by almost 37% between 2000 and 2010. Also, light rail development <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> recent years. Bicycle usage for work commutes is minimal.|$|E
5|$|Satellite {{observations}} {{record a}} decrease in snow-covered areas since the 1960s, when satellites when satellite observations began. In some areas, including China, snow cover <b>has</b> <b>increased.</b> <b>In</b> some regions such as China, a trend of increasing snow cover has been observed from 1978 to 2006. These changes are attributed to global climate change, which may lead to earlier melting and less aea coverage. However, in some areas {{there may be an}} increase in snow depth because of higher temperatures for latitudes north of 40°. For the Northern Hemisphere as a whole the mean monthly snow-cover extent has been decreasing by 1.3% per decade.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of total immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibodies and antibodies {{of the four}} IgG subclasses in serum against Haemophilus influenzae type b capsular polysaccharide (CPS) was studied in 24 children and 11 adults with invasive Haemophilus influenzae type b infections, by using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. None of the 8 children aged 10 months or younger <b>had</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> the IgG class or {{in any of the}} IgG subclasses. In contrast, 14 of 16 children between 10 months and 6 years of age and 10 of 11 adults <b>had</b> significant <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> total IgG, IgG 1, or IgG 2 antibodies in various combinations, but none of them <b>had</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> IgG 3 or IgG 4 antibodies. The <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> IgG 1 and IgG 2 antibodies in the children were of similar magnitudes. Of 11 adult patients, 9 <b>had</b> significant <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> IgG 2 antibodies, while only 4 <b>had</b> <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> IgG 1 antibodies. In conclusion, this study shows that children younger than approximately 1 year have no IgG response to H. influenzae type b CPS, while individuals above this age have a mixed IgG 1 and IgG 2 response...|$|R

5|$|The BLM {{management}} of the herd has included improvements to the range to give the horses additional access to water, and numerous roundups that {{have resulted in the}} removal and adoption of hundreds of horses to private individuals, including over 50 horses in 2009, and another 44 in 2012. In 2015, a plan was approved to gather 6-12 one and two year old horses annually until the contraceptive vaccine the mares are given can lower birth rates more. This resulted in the most recent gather and removal of 17 horses and 1 foal. Once again, every horse captured was adopted. The Pryor Mountains Wild Horse Range {{is one of the most}} accessible areas to view feral horse herds in the United States and tourism to the area <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> recent years.|$|E
5|$|The {{headwaters}} of the Snake River and the high mountains elsewhere in the watershed were historically heavily forested. These include aspen, Douglas fir, and spruce fir, comprising about 20% of the historic watershed. At the base of mountains and in the Lost River basin, sagebrush was and is the predominant vegetation cover. Because of deforestation, up to {{one quarter of the}} forests have been taken over by sagebrush, leaving the remaining forests to cover about 15% of the watershed. However, the lodgepole pine <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> number, taking over historic stands of other conifers. There are also up to 118 species of rare or endemic plants that occur in the Snake River watershed.|$|E
5|$|Though ideologically {{the temples}} are {{divided between the}} sects of Hinduism, namely Saivism and Vaishnavism, the Char Dham pilgrimage is an all-Hindu affair. There are four abodes in the Himalayas called Chota Char Dham (Chota meaning small): Badrinath, Kedarnath, Gangotri and Yamunotriall of which lie {{in the foothills of}} the Himalayas. The name Chota was added during the mid of 20th century to {{differentiate}} the original Char Dhams.

5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been a steady {{increase}} in the energy output of the Sun. When the Sun first became a main sequence star, it radiated only 70% of the current luminosity. The luminosity <b>has</b> <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> a nearly linear fashion to the present, rising by 1% every 110 million years. Likewise, in three billion years the Sun {{is expected to be}} 33% more luminous. The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.|$|E
