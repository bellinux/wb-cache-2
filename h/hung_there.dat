5|$|A strong {{smell of}} burning {{was present in}} the Lords' {{chambers}} during the afternoon of 16 October, and at 4:00pm two gentlemen tourists visiting to see the Armada tapestries that <b>hung</b> <b>there</b> were unable to view them properly because of the thick smoke. As they approached Black Rod's box {{in the corner of}} the room, they felt heat from the floor coming through their boots. Shortly after 4:00pm Cross and Furlong finished work, put the last few sticks into the furnaces—closing the doors as they did so—and left to go to the nearby Star and Garter public house.|$|E
25|$|A {{well-known}} incident involved paratrooper John Steele of the 505th Parachute Infantry Regiment (PIR), whose parachute {{caught on}} the spire of the town church, and could only observe the fighting going on below. He <b>hung</b> <b>there</b> limply for two hours, pretending to be dead, before the Germans took him prisoner. Steele later escaped from the Germans and rejoined his division when US troops of the 3rd Battalion, 505 Parachute Infantry Regiment attacked the village, capturing thirty Germans and killing another eleven. The incident was portrayed in the movie The Longest Day by actor Red Buttons.|$|E
25|$|The {{structure}} was enlarged within {{ten years of}} its original construction and, in 1315, the bell tower was added and in the subsequent year, a great bell was <b>hung</b> <b>there.</b> The {{upper part of the}} {{structure was}} covered in 1472 and the large hall divided into two rooms, one large and the other small. The larger of the two occupied an area that corresponds approximately to the room known today as the Sala dei Quattrocento. Subsequently, the building functioned as a residence for the Capitano del Popolo, the Podestà and the Signori Sette.|$|E

25|$|First sold in 1897 by Van Gogh's {{sister-in-law}} for 300 francs, {{the painting}} was subsequently bought by Paul Cassirer (1904), Kessler (1904), and Druet (1910). In 1911, {{the painting was}} acquired by the Städel (Städtische Galerie) in Frankfurt, Germany and <b>hung</b> <b>there</b> until 1933, when the painting was put in a hidden room. The Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda confiscated the work in 1937 {{as part of its}} campaign to rid Germany of so-called degenerate art. Hermann Göring, through his agent Sepp Angerer, sold it to Franz Koenigs in Paris, together with 'The quarry of Bibemus' by Cézanne and Daubigny's Garden, the latter also by van Gogh. In August 1939, Koenigs transported the paintings from Paris to Knoedler's in New York. Siegfried Kramarsky fled to Lisbon in November 1939 and arrived January 1940 in New York. The paintings ended up in Kramarsky's custody, where the work was often lent to the Metropolitan Museum of Art.|$|E
25|$|When news began leaking {{that the}} three men were to be {{executed}} and a country-wide curfew would be imposed at 11:00 PM, Paglin was at a movie. After being called out and told the news, he hurried to Begin's safe house, where he was meeting with members of his high command, where doubts were being raised over the feasibility of hanging the sergeants with the British and Haganah on high alert. Paglin, {{who had not been}} allowed to venture into British-controlled areas by the high command for the previous six months, asked to take personal charge of the operation. He was convinced that the sergeants could be hanged inside the plant, and the bodies could be moved to an orange grove and <b>hung</b> <b>there,</b> since attempting to move the two alive would be too great a risk. Since the hangings were meant as a 'lesson for all to see', Irgun wanted the bodies hung up in public. That was so clear that the mayor of Tel Aviv, Yisrael Rokah, feared Irgun would hang them in the city's main square, while in Netanya it was feared that they would be hanged on local lamp posts. Begin approved Paglin's plan. Paglin then slipped {{out of the house and}} drove to Netanya in his car, where he collected four Irgun men; Benjamin Kaplan, Yoel Kimchi, Avraham Rubin, and Yosef Meller. They arrived at the diamond plant in the afternoon.|$|E
500|$|Ditton has a ford which, {{along with}} St Peter's Ad Vincula's Church, is {{situated}} in a conservation area on the west of a large green. The church is dated to the 12th century with a later 14th-century tower and the first bell of Ditton church was <b>hung</b> <b>there</b> in 1656. Ditton parish register has as its opening words, [...] "The Register book of Ditton beginning Anno Dom. 1663. William Jole, rector, inducted Rector of Ditton, 1st August, Anno Dom. 1663." [...] Also at the commencement it is recorded, on 1 August 1711, that every acre of woodland in the parish of Ditton by immemorial custom pays tithe to the rector. In 1798 Ditton was recorded as being within the ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the Diocese of Rochester, and deanery of Malling. This parish, among others, was obliged {{to contribute to the}} repair of the fifth pier of Rochester bridge. The church was restored in 1860 by Sir George Gilbert Scott.|$|E

500|$|The fight scene between Jack and Ethan was {{performed}} by the actors themselves. The two were given the freedom to set up how their characters would fight each other. However, stunt coordinator Michael Vendrell wanted Ethan to be [...] "as feral as possible; no school of combat, karate, kung-fu." [...] Before filming the scene where Jack finds Charlie, episode director Stephen Williams scouted for a suitable location and found [...] "what looked like a cathedral," [...] because of the layout of trees behind where Charlie was hung. Monaghan had to be harnessed to a cable for roughly four to five hours. The actor described the scene; [...] "they {{put me in the}} tree and I just <b>hung</b> <b>there.</b> I just hung limp. I tried to fall asleep, I tried to relax. When everything was going on, when they cut me down from the tree, when [...] was trying to revive me, when [...] was crying, I really didn't hear any of it. I just was in a semi-meditative state; however close that I could get with someone smacking me in the chest.|$|E

When they sought advice about this event, an oracle told them to take the head down and bury it, and to make annual {{sacrifice}} to Onesilos as a hero, saying {{that it would be better}} for them if they did this.

2500|$|When Israel {{included}} Khdeir in its Victims of Acts of Terror Memorial at Mount Herzl, {{the family}} obtained its immediate removal. They {{had not been}} consulted, dismissed the inclusion as a bid to improve Israel’s image, rebuffed the idea of him being memorialized among fallen Israeli soldiers who [...] "killed his relatives in Gaza, Lebanon and the West Bank", stated {{the trial of the}} suspects was being dragged out, and complained that several months earlier, the Jerusalem council had forced them to remove his image from outside their home after it had <b>hung</b> <b>there</b> for four months, by threatening them with a per diem $500 fine, on the grounds it contravened a local Israeli law.|$|E
2500|$|The painting's {{history is}} certain after {{it appears in}} a list of 1813 of the {{paintings}} bequeathed to Alleyn's College the charity owning Dulwich College, a school in the London suburbs, by Sir Francis Bourgeois in 1811. [...] It was described as by Annibale Carracci here, and only finally confirmed as a Domenichino in 1906–7 by Hans Tietze, an attribution since accepted by all writers. [...] The Dulwich Picture Gallery was founded to hold the Bourgeois bequest and other artworks owned by the charity, and the painting <b>hung</b> <b>there</b> until it was controversially sold by the trustees in 1971. [...] It was sold at auction for £100,000 by Sotheby's London on 24 March 1971, and bought by the National Gallery of Scotland. [...] The sale {{was the subject of}} an adjournment debate in the House of Commons on May 13, 1971, where both the trustees and the minister whose consent had been necessary for the sale to occur were criticised by George Strauss M.P., especially for only publicising the sale three weeks before the auction. [...] For a month over Christmas and New Year 2011/12 the painting returned to Dulwich as part of the celebrations for the gallery's bicentenary.|$|E

2500|$|The Crown Collection {{works on}} display are also usually {{augmented}} with approximately 100 art pieces and antiques {{on loan from}} various museums, galleries, and private collections; this continues a tradition started in the 1930s, when the National Gallery lent pieces to the viceroy at the time, the Earl of Bessborough. Additionally, {{since the time of}} Clarkson's appointment, themed artistic exhibitions have been mounted at Rideau Hall, such as that during the tenure of Michaëlle Jean wherein the show [...] "Body and Land" [...] featured select silkscreen prints from the artist's book The Journals of Susanna Moodie by author Margaret Atwood and artist Charles Pachter. What had been praised during Clarkson's tenure, however, was soon critiqued when it was revealed that into Jean's appointment, Rideau Hall's interpretation and exhibition planner, Fabienne Fusade, was removing from sight the portraits of Canada's past and present sovereigns {{and other members of the}} Royal Family, in order to fulfill Jean's wish to make the royal residence a showcase for Canadian art and give [...] "a strong image of Canada"; the portrait by Jean Paul Lemieux of Queen Elizabeth II and the Duke of Edinburgh that had for decades dominated the focal wall of the ballroom was shifted to the rear wall, thereby bumping the copy of George Hayter's [...] that had <b>hung</b> <b>there</b> to the Tent Room, where the portraits of Canada's British governors general had been collected together. These moves and removals were criticised by the editorial board of the National Post, as well as other journalists, as having [...] "demoted and ghettoized" [...] history in order to [...] "siphon off the great symbolic power of the monarchy, to further [...] particular tastes and agendas," [...] noting that Rideau Hall should not be used [...] "primarily [...] an art gallery." ...|$|E
