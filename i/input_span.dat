The present technique is aimed at increasing the velocity measurement range of the instrument. This is particularly important in blood flow measurement applications. The probe field is formed by the holographic technique employing the static periodic wavefront modulator and the field-forming hologram. By proper selection of the parameters of these components, the probe field with pronounced high-order spatial harmonic content is obtained. This results {{in the presence of}} several Doppler frequency harmonics in the output signal.

This paper presents a continuous and programmable first-order – filter with sub-millivolt offset performance. Low offset is achieved by auto-zeroing and continuity by ping-ponging between two transconductors, all under the construct of a compact and bandwidth-efficient circuit topology. The proposed – circuit was fabricated with AMI’s 0. 5 - m CMOS process technology and achieved an input-referred offset of less than 210 V, hand-over glitches of less than 40 mV, and 57 dB of linearity over the rail-to-rail <b>input</b> <b>span</b> for a lithium-ion battery supply range of 3 to 4. 2 V.

The mixing of the fuel gas with the combustion air takes place after the original fuel jet has been diluted with combustion products. Scaling rules of staged-low NOX flames should aim to reach these conditions. To achieve similarity in the flow pattern the general conclusions are: · The staged fuel-to-central-air momentum ratio must be maintained; · The staged Natural Gas (NG) jet momentum and Re must be high enough; · The effect of the furnace confinement is secondary for confinement ratio larger than 3 (the ratio between the furnace diameter and the quarl outlet diameter); · The geometrical burner similarity should be maintained; · The heat extraction in the furnace should be similar...|$|E
