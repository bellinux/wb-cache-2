5|$|The Tosa-class {{ships were}} {{intended}} to be armed with a main battery of ten 45-caliber 41-centimeter guns in five twin turrets, four of which were superfiring fore and aft. Numbered one through five from front to rear, the <b>hydraulically</b> <b>powered</b> turrets had an elevation range of −2 to +35 degrees. The rate of fire for the guns was around two rounds per minute. The ships were designed to carry 90 rounds per gun, although space was available for 110.|$|E
5|$|Courageous carried four BL 15-inch Mk I guns in two <b>hydraulically</b> <b>powered</b> {{twin gun}} turrets, {{designated}} 'A' and 'Y' {{from front to}} rear. Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen BL 4-inch Mk IX guns mounted in six manually powered mounts. The mount placed three breeches too close together, causing the 23 loaders to get in one another's way, and preventing the intended high rate of fire. A pair of QF 3-inch 20 cwt anti-aircraft guns were fitted abreast the mainmast on Courageous. She mounted two submerged tubes for 21-inch torpedoes and carried 10 torpedoes for them.|$|E
5|$|Situated {{just below}} Northwich, the Anderton Boat Lift {{is now the}} normal route for leisure boats to reach the river. Following its closure in 1983, a Trust was created to {{campaign}} for its restoration. The lift became a Scheduled Ancient Monument in 1994, and work eventually started on its refurbishment in 1999. It reopened in 2002, and is once more <b>hydraulically</b> <b>powered.</b> The use of modern hydraulic fluids is expected to prevent the problem of corrosion suffered when it was originally built.|$|E

25|$|In 1998 Chris Phoenix informally {{outlined}} a {{design for a}} <b>hydraulically</b> <b>powered</b> replicator a few cubic feet in volume that used ultraviolet light to cure soft plastic feedstock and a fluidic logic control system, but didn't address most {{of the details of}} assembly procedures, error rates, or machining tolerances.|$|E
25|$|The {{complexity}} {{and weight of}} mechanical flight control systems increase considerably with the size and performance of the aircraft. <b>Hydraulically</b> <b>powered</b> control surfaces help to overcome these limitations. With hydraulic flight control systems, the aircraft's size and performance are limited by economics rather than a pilot's muscular strength. At first, only-partially boosted systems were used in which the pilot could still feel some of the aerodynamic loads on the control surfaces (feedback).|$|E
50|$|The {{standard}} equipment of the BTR-3U also includes <b>hydraulically</b> amplified <b>powered</b> steering {{on the front}} four road wheels and a central tire-pressure regulation system that allows the driver to adjust the tire-pressure to suit the terrain being crossed. The BTR-3U is fitted with French Michelin tires.|$|R
50|$|Hydrostatic {{transmissions}} transmit all <b>power</b> <b>hydraulically,</b> {{using the}} components of hydraulic machinery. They are similar to electrical transmissions, but use hydraulic fluid as the power distribution system rather than electricity.|$|R
50|$|Tools, such as hooks or socket {{wrenches}} can be mounted {{at the end}} of the pole. More sophisticated poles can accept pneumatically or <b>hydraulically</b> driven <b>power</b> tools which allow, for example, bolts to be unscrewed remotely. A rotary wire brush allows a terminal to be scoured clean before a connection is made. However, a worker's dexterity is naturally reduced when operating tools {{at the end of}} a pole that is several metres long.|$|R
25|$|The Flamingo's {{fuselage}} had a {{welded steel}} tube structure, skinned forward with light alloy and aft with laminated plastic. Its {{two rows of}} seats were enclosed under a three part canopy which merged at the rear into the raised fuselage. There was a wide door on either side for cabin access and a separate baggage space behind the seats. It had a retractable tricycle undercarriage with the mainwheels, fitted with brakes, behind the engines. The nosewheel was steerable. The undercarriage, like the flaps and airbrakes, were <b>hydraulically</b> <b>powered.</b>|$|E
25|$|Hawker Aircraft {{continued}} {{to develop and}} refine the Sea Fury Mk X, resulting in the more capable Sea Fury Mk 11, otherwise known as the Sea Fury FB 11. This upgraded model had several improvements, most notable being the <b>hydraulically</b> <b>powered</b> wing folding mechanism which eased flight deck operations and the adoption of new weapons for performing air-to-ground combat. Iraq ordered a two-seat Sea Fury model and the British Admiralty followed suit. During testing, the rear canopy collapsed, leading to a redesign of the type's two-seat cockpit prior to entering service. Designated as the Sea Fury T 20, a total of 60 trainers were manufactured for the Fleet Air Arm between 1950 and 1952. The Royal Navy bought a total of 615 Sea Furies, mostly of the Mk 11 standard.|$|E

40|$|It's {{become clear}} that if muscles could be <b>powered</b> <b>hydraulically</b> instead of pneumatically, then they would provide a very {{efficient}} actuator for underwater use.

5000|$|The Entracque Power Plant, {{also known}} as The Upper Gesso Plant, is a pumped-storage {{hydroelectric}} power station located in Valle Gesso just south of Entracque, Italy. The power station contains pump-generators for two co-located but <b>hydraulically</b> separated <b>power</b> schemes; the Chiotas-Piastra Plant and Rovina-Piastra Plant. Both plants use separate upper reservoirs but use Lago della Piastra as their common lower reservoir. To produce power, water is released from the upper reservoirs to the power station located at the lower reservoir. The pump-generators re-fill the reservoirs and the process repeats as needed. The Chiotas' upper reservoir, Lago del Chiotas, is located much higher in the valley and larger than Rovina's Lago della Rovina which affords it the ability to produce more electricity. The installed capacity of Chiotas is [...] with a hydraulic head (water drop in elevation) of 1048 m while Rovina has an installed capacity of [...] and a head of 598 m. Construction on the plant began in 1962 and operations started in 1982. It is {{owned and operated by}} Enel.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the design of}} and some preliminary control results for a <b>hydraulically</b> actuated human <b>power</b> amplifier. The system {{is in the form}} of an oar, with its reach and pitch degrees of freedom being hydraulically assisted. A robust PI force controller is proposed so that the hydraulic actuator force tracks a scaled copy of the force exerted by the human. Nonlinearities and uncertainties in the compression spring, as well as parametric uncertainties are taken into account. The passivity property of the closed loop system is also analyzed. The controller has been tested in simulations and experimentally. It is shown to be effective when pushing against an object, and in assisting in bearing static loads. ...|$|R
5000|$|The most {{important}} {{changes were made}} to the front and rear of the body where the designers reinterpreted the styling in a more modern idiom. In particular, the tail was squared and simplified, and the nose lost its separate air intake and headlamp nacelles. The mechanics retained most of the Flavia's specifications including the front-wheel drive, boxer engine, independent suspension and disc brakes all around, with vacuum-assist and split-circuits (called [...] "Superduplex" [...] by Lancia).The 2000 used the 1991 cc 4-cylinder boxer engine, available in either carbureted form (115 hp) or with fuel-injection (126 hp). The latter abandoned the previously used Kugelfisher mechanical system in favor of a more reliable Bosch D-type electronic system. The transmission (produced by ZF) was a 4-speed manual-type for the 2000 equipped with a carburetor, and a manual 5-speed for the fuel-injected 2000. Since the 2000 was given a flagship role for Lancia (following in the footsteps of the prestigious Flaminia), the 2000 was given a high standard of finishes (fine wood for the dashboard and velvet or leather upholstery) and standard or optional equipment including <b>hydraulically</b> operated <b>power</b> steering (also manufactured by ZF), air conditioning, electric windows and sun blinds.|$|R
