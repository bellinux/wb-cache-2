50|$|The <b>gomphosis</b> is {{the only}} joint-type in which a bone does not join another bone, as teeth are not {{technically}} bone. In modern, more anatomical, joint classification, the <b>gomphosis</b> is simply considered a fibrous joint because the tissue linking the structures is ligamentous.|$|E
50|$|Suture {{joints and}} <b>Gomphosis</b> joints are synarthroses.|$|E
50|$|A <b>gomphosis</b> {{is a joint}} {{between the}} root of a tooth and the socket in the maxilla or {{mandible}} (jawbones).|$|E
5000|$|A suture {{is a type}} of {{fibrous joint}} that is only found in the skull. The bones are bound {{together}} by Sharpey's fibres. A tiny amount of movement is permitted at sutures, which contributes to the compliance and elasticity of the skull.These joints are synarthroses. It is normal for many of the bones of the skull to remain unfused at birth. The fusion of the skull's bones at birth is known as craniosynostosis. The term [...] "fontanelle" [...] is used to describe the resulting [...] "soft spots". The relative positions of the bones continue to change during the life of the adult (though less rapidly), which can provide useful information in forensics and archaeology. In old age, cranial sutures may ossify (turn to bone) completely.The joints between the teeth (<b>gomphoses)</b> and the joint between the mandible and the cranium, the temporomandibular joint, form the only non-sutured joints in the skull.|$|R
50|$|The {{motion of}} a <b>gomphosis</b> is minimal, though {{considerable}} movement {{can be achieved}} over time—the basis of using braces to realign teeth. The joint {{can be considered a}} synarthrosis.|$|E
50|$|Tooth enamel {{is white}} {{initially}} but {{is susceptible to}} stains from coffee and cigarette usage. A tooth sits in a specialized socket called <b>gomphosis.</b> The tooth is held in location by a periodontal ligament, {{with the assistance of}} cementum.|$|E
50|$|A <b>gomphosis</b> is a {{specialized}} fibrous joint {{in which a}} conical process or peg of one bone fits into a hole or socket in another bone.(gomphos is a Greek word meaning bolt). Small quantity of fibrous tissue holds the bones together.No movement is possible at such peg-and-socket joints.|$|E
5000|$|Gomphoses {{are found}} in the sockets of the teeth. The socket of a tooth is often {{referred}} to as a <b>gomphosis</b> (type of a joint in which a conical peg fits into a socket). Normally, there should be an absolutely minimal amount of movement of the teeth in the mandible or maxilla.|$|E
50|$|A <b>gomphosis,</b> {{also known}} as a dentoalveolar syndesmosis, is a joint that binds the teeth to bony teeth sockets in the maxillary bone and mandible. The fibrous {{connection}} between a tooth and its socket is a periodontal ligament. Specifically, the connection is made between the maxilla or mandible to the cementum of the tooth.|$|E
50|$|Dental alveoli (singular alveolus) are sockets in {{the jaws}} {{in which the}} roots of teeth are held in the {{alveolar}} process with the periodontal ligament. The lay term for dental alveoli is tooth sockets. A joint that connects {{the roots of the}} teeth and the alveolus is called <b>gomphosis</b> (plural gomphoses). Alveolar bone is the bone that surrounds the roots of the teeth forming bone sockets.|$|E
50|$|A joint or {{articulation}} (or articular surface) is {{the connection}} made between {{bones in the}} body which link the skeletal system into a functional whole. They are constructed to allow for different degrees and types of movement. Some joints, such as the knee, elbow, and shoulder, are self-lubricating, almost frictionless, {{and are able to}} withstand compression and maintain heavy loads while still executing smooth and precise movements. Other joints such as sutures between the bones of the skull permit very little movement (only during birth) {{in order to protect the}} brain and the sense organs. The connection between a tooth and the jawbone is also called a joint, and is described as a fibrous joint known as a <b>gomphosis.</b> Joints are classified both structurally and functionally.|$|E
40|$|The gum and the {{desmodontium}} are constituent {{parts of}} the morpho-functional complex of the parodontium. Depending on its topographic situation, we can describe three portions of the gum: alveolar, marginal and interdental, each one having its features. Within the gum, the collagen fibres from the subepihtelial net are grouped in alveologingival, dentogingival, circular and interdental, the last ones being seen by us as a single group, called peridental fibres. The desmodontium or the alveolodental ligament or the parodontal ligament makes {{the relation between the}} alveolar bone and the radicular cement within the dentoalveolar articulation, articulation known under the name of <b>gomphosis,</b> a syndesmose that does not allow any movement to the tooth. Depending on their topographic situation, the collagen fibres in the constitution of the alveolodental ligament, also called cemento-alveolar fibres, can be divided in marginal, intermediary and apical. The alveolodental ligament has the important role in the transmission of the chewing forces to the resistance structures within the functional architectonics of the cranium...|$|E
40|$|JHE rostral {{teeth of}} the Pristidae exhibit a number of peculiarities which have {{interested}} dental anatomists for some time. They are reputed to be composed of vaso-dentin by some ' and of plici-dentin by others 3; they are im-planted in sockets along the margin of a rostrum, <b>gomphosis</b> {{being one of the}} rarer methods of attachment in pisces; they are reputed to be held in these sockets by cementum'; and they {{are one of the few}} examples as Owen says "of 'permanent teeth ' to be met with in the whole class, " i. e., they grow from persistent pulps. Owen seems to have been the only person to suggest that they were not teeth at all " [...] and the rostral teeth of Pristis (if these modi-fied dermal spines may be so called). An examination of these teeth was carried out to investigate the structure of the dentin during an histologic survey of the types of dentin which may occur in the animal kingdom. MATERIAL AND METHODS The material consisted of dried museum specimens. In many ways, this was unfortunate, as fixed material would have proved very useful in a stud...|$|E
40|$|The {{osteology}} of Protobrama avus, of a {{new species}} of this genus, P. woodwardi, and of two new monospecific genera of protobramid fishes, Eusebichthys byblosi and Abisaadichthys libanicus, is studied. Protobramidae are small deep-bodied marine teleosts from the Lower Cenomanian of Lebanon. They are characterised by the <b>gomphosis</b> of the neural and haemal arches on the centra all along the axial skeleton, the loss of segmentation on the dorsal and anal fin rays, the small cycloid scales covering {{the basis of the}} unpaired fins, the ribs fused with the haemapophyses, the loss of epicentrals and epipleurals, the loss of epurals, the reduced number (4 or 5) of hypurals and the fusion of hypurals 3 and 4 into a dorsal hypural plate. The skull is medio-parietal. The temporal fossa is dorsally bordered by the parietal. The jaws are feebly toothed or toothless. The maxillary, which is bordering the mouth, is always toothless. The supramaxillaries are lost. The possible synonymy of the Protobramidae and Plethodidae (or Tselfatiidae) as well as the integration of the Protobramidae, the Araripichthyidae and the Ferrifronsidae into a suborder of the Protobramoidei are discussed and rejected. The analysis of the protobramid characters leads to range them as a valid family in the clupeocephalan order Tselfatiiformes near the Plethodidae...|$|E
40|$|Background The dentitions of extinct organisms {{can provide}} pivotal {{information}} regarding their phylogenetic position, {{as well as}} paleobiology, diet, development, and growth. Extant birds are edentulous (toothless), but their closest relatives among stem birds, the Cretaceous Hesperornithiformes and Ichthyornithiformes, retained teeth. Despite their significant phylogenetic position immediately outside the avian crown group, the dentitions of these taxa have never been studied in detail. To obtain new insight into the biology of these ‘last’ toothed birds, we use cutting-edge visualisation techniques to describe their dentitions at unprecedented levels of detail, in particular propagation phase contrast x-ray synchrotron microtomography at high-resolution. Results Among other characteristics of tooth shape, growth, attachment, implantation, replacement, and dental tissue microstructures, revealed by these analyses, we find that tooth morphology and ornamentation differ greatly between the Hesperornithiformes and Ichthyornithiformes. We also highlight the first Old World, and youngest record of the major Mesozoic clade Ichthyornithiformes. Both taxa exhibit extremely thin and simple enamel. The extension rate of Hesperornis tooth dentine appears relatively high compared to non-avian dinosaurs. Root attachment is found {{for the first time}} to be fully thecodont via <b>gomphosis</b> in both taxa, but in Hesperornis secondary evolution led to teeth implantation in a groove, at least locally without a periodontal ligament. Dental replacement is shown to be lingual via a resorption pit in the root, in both taxa. Conclusions Our results allow comparison with other archosaurs and also mammals, with implications regarding dental character evolution across amniotes. Some dental features of the ‘last’ toothed birds can be interpreted as functional adaptations related to diet and mode of predation, while others appear to be products of their peculiar phylogenetic heritage. The autapomorphic Hesperornis groove might have favoured firmer root attachment. These observations highlight complexity in the evolutionary history of tooth reduction in the avian lineage and also clarify alleged avian dental characteristics in the frame of a long-standing debate on bird origins. Finally, new hypotheses emerge that will possibly be tested by further analyses of avian teeth, for instance regarding dental replacement rates, or simplification and thinning of enamel throughout the course of early avian evolution...|$|E
