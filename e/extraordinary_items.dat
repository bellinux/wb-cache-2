40|$|Changes in {{accounting}} and financial reporting are inevitable (Hall & Aldridge, 2007). Hall and Aldridge (2007) stated that this happens because in preparing periodic financial statements, companies must take estimates and judgements to allocate costs and revenues. Accounting disclosure especially {{notification of information}} on a business unit has become a widely studied area in the West (Benston, 1973). The issue of accounting change has been subject to considerable research attention during the 1990 s. The main interest has been directed at exploring changes in: accounting systems, accounting techniques, the accountancy profession, {{and the role of}} an accountant (for general references to such work, see Chua (1995) and Bhimani (1996)). In Malaysia, the accounting disclosure has yet to be studied vigorously (Hamzah, 1983). This however, does not mean that this issue is unimportant, and lately a lot of researchers have been researching on the report of <b>extraordinary</b> <b>item</b> (Shamsul & Nor Izah, 2000), cash flow statement (Ng, 1999), empirical studies on accounting and disclosure (Ng, 1998), uses of financial report (Azhar, 1999) and information that are needed by consumer and voluntary disclosures by the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange (KLSE), currently name as Bursa Malaysia listed companies (Tan et al., 1990). Disclosure is a means whereby information regarding a business unit can be conveyed. Based on this information, interested parties and potential investors will be informed of {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} a particular business unit, in terms of profits made, and/or whether the management of the business unit act in a manner which can be of benefit to the potential investors (Hamzah, 1983). Consistency in the accounting policy as stated in the Malaysian Accounting Standards Board (MASB) 1 is one of the accounting doctrine, which is the basis of financial planning and presentation. Users should be able to compare and differentiate every company financial statement for a period of time to identify financial position flow, performance, and cash flow. For that matter, the same accounting policy will be used for an accounting period. Changes in the accounting policy need to be done if directed by the law or the MASB, or if the change will give a more accurate result for presenting a situation or transaction in a company’s financial statement (MASB 3). This study is a preliminary study on the accounting disclosure by listed companies on the main board of the KLSE based on their annual financial report. The remainder of this paper is structured as follows. The next section provides an overview of accounting change. Section three discusses research methodology, followed by research findings.

40|$|U. S. District Judge Robert R. Merhige Jr. {{approved}} {{late yesterday}} afternoon the final {{terms of the}} agreements settling the uranium contract litigation involving Westinghouse Electric Corp. and Virginia Electric and Power Co. The companies had announced an agreement in principle April 16 to resolve their 4 -year-old dispute that arose when Westinghouse canceled three uranium supply contracts it had with Vepco involving more than 14 million pounds of uranium. As reported previously, Vepco said the settlement provides for the payment of cash, uranium deliveries and goods and services having a present value to the utility of more than 380 million. 2 ̆ 2 This sum {{is equal to the}} value of the uranium contracts under litigation if they had been fully performed by Westinghouse, 2 ̆ 2 Vepco said. The specific terms of the settlement were approved by Vepco 2 ̆ 7 s board of directors several hours before the final order dismissing the case was signed by Merhige. In addition to a cash payment having a present value of 129 million, Vepco will receive 7. 5 million pounds of uranium from Westinghouse between 1980 and 1994 with a present value to the utility of about 130 million. The settlement also stipulates that Vepco may receive cash payments having a present value of up to 48 million from Westinghouse out of any proceeds it might receive if it is successful in its pending antitrust suit against members of the uranium cartel. Westinghouse estimated that the pretax cost of its current and future obligations to Vepco {{as a result of the}} settlement is approximately 202. 2 million. This will be accounted for, the company said, as an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>item</b> in the second quarter. As part of the uranium settlement, the companies also completed their previously announced plans to resolve a dispute over repairs to the steam generators at the Surry power station. Westinghouse had built the turbine generator equipment which Vepco now is having to replace at the plant. 2 ̆ 2 This agreement provides for recovery from Westinghouse of cash and goods and services of over 32 million, 2 ̆ 2 Vepco said. 2 ̆ 2 This is equivalent to about 35 percent of the cost of repairs to the steam generators and turbine generator. 2 ̆ 2 While the turbine generator settlement was less than 100 cents on the dollar, Vepco said Dean William B. Spong Jr. of the College of William and Mary 2 ̆ 7 s law school had found the terms to be fair and equitable to both the utility and to Westinghouse. Spong has served as Merhige 2 ̆ 7 s special settlement negotiator in the uranium contract litigation.

Two types of statistical tests performed have confirmed the proposition that the disclosure of <b>extraordinary</b> <b>items</b> is subject to this type of manipulation during the period before the adoption of the new standard. Although it is proved that the broad definition of <b>extraordinary</b> <b>items</b> allows companies to manipulate income, evidence gathered from multivariate regressions demonstrates that <b>extraordinary</b> <b>items</b> are of value-relevance for investors in valuing a firm's equity. Thus, investors take into account the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>items</b> even though it is disclosed 'below the line'...|$|E

It is hypothesised that Australian agricultural firms {{are more likely}} to report big bath losses in drought years than in non-drought years, and in a given drought year, agricultural firms {{are more likely to}} report big bath losses than firms in other industries. Design/methodology We analyse 405 firm-years data for agricultural firms over 1980 - 1995. For comparison, we also analyse matched-pair samples of 17 and 30 non-agricultural firms for the drought years of 1983 and 1995, and matched-pair samples of 19 non-agricultural firms for the non-drought years of 1986 and 1990, respectively. Both univariate and multivariate analyses are used to test the hypotheses. Findings It is found that agricultural firms are more likely to take big baths in drought years than in non-drought years.

To the extent that stock price reflects the market 2 ̆ 7 s expectation about future earnings, the return predictability of the two components of income should differ when they have different persistence. The study finds that while the profitability of the conventional EP trading rule is significant, it increases substantially when the earnings are defined to be operating income rather than net income before <b>extraordinary</b> <b>items</b> and discontinued operations. Further, the conventional risk factors, including market return and firm size, do not fully explain the profitability of EP trading rule based on operating income.

40|$|Misgivings about dirty surplus {{accounting}} practices derive, in part, from two related concerns. Firstly, {{it has been}} argued that dirty surplus accounting might result in value-relevant items being reported within ‘dirty surplus flows’ rather than within earnings. Secondly, it has been suggested that the low transparency of dirty surplus flows might reduce investors' ability to recognize value-relevant items in a timely fashion. In this study, we address the first of these concerns. We examine UK stock returns and accounting flows accumulated over intervals of up to 20 years. We report evidence on the value-relevance of accounting flows which were excluded from ‘ordinary profit’ (i. e. accounting profit exclusive of <b>extraordinary</b> <b>items)</b> in the UK over the period from 1972 to 1992. Our tests provide strong evidence that UK ordinary profit is value-relevant and provide some evidence, on the basis of long-interval tests, that <b>extraordinary</b> <b>items</b> are value-relevant. There is little evidence that other flows excluded from ordinary profit are value-relevant, however. These finding may allay concerns that, by allowing value-relevant flows to bypass reported earnings, dirty surplus {{accounting practices}} have promoted undesirable ‘creative accounting’ activity by UK firms...|$|E
