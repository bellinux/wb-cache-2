5|$|Born in Purbalingga, Dutch East Indies, Sudirman {{moved to}} Cilacap in 1916 and {{was raised by}} his uncle. A diligent student at a Muhammadiyah-run school, he became {{respected}} within the community for his devotion to Islam. After dropping out of teacher's college, in 1936 he began working as a teacher, and later headmaster, at a Muhammadiyah-run elementary school. After the Japanese occupied the Indies in 1942, Sudirman continued to teach, before joining the Japanese-sponsored Defenders of the Homeland as a battalion commander in Banyumas in 1944. In this position <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> a rebellion by his fellow soldiers, but was later interned in Bogor. After Indonesia proclaimed its independence on 17 August 1945, Sudirman led a break-out then went to Jakarta to meet President Sukarno. Tasked with overseeing the surrender of Japanese soldiers in Banyumas, he established {{a division of the}} People's Safety Body there. On 12 November 1945, at an election to decide the military's commander-in-chief in Yogyakarta, Sudirman was chosen over Oerip Soemohardjo in a close vote. While waiting to be confirmed, Sudirman ordered an assault on British and Dutch forces in Ambarawa. The ensuing battle and British withdrawal strengthened Sudirman's popular support, and he was ultimately confirmed on 18 December.|$|E

All of a sudden, his behaviour with his parents changed awkwardly. But as soon as he left Meerut, things went normally.|$|E
25|$|Returning home to New Hampshire, he {{was named}} the state's {{attorney}} general in 1782 and served until 1786. During this same time {{he was elected to}} the state assembly, and served as speaker of the house. He led the drive in New Hampshire that led to ratification of the United States Constitution on June 21, 1788. He was elected President of New Hampshire (now Governor) in 1786, 1787 and 1789. During his first term as governor, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the Exeter Rebellion.|$|E

It is evident that he had need of that fortifier and refresher. <b>He</b> <b>puts</b> <b>down</b> the beaker and says, [...] "How are you, Titmarsh? I was SO cut last night. My eyes, wasn't I! Not in the least: that's all." ...|$|R

25|$|Kankoro-sigui Mari Djata, {{who had no}} {{relation}} to the Keita clan, essentially ran the empire in Musa Keita II's stead. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> a Berber Tuareg rebellion in Takedda and campaigned in Gao. Ibn Khaldun recorded that in 776 A.H or 1374/1375 AD he interviewed a Sijilmasan scholar named Muhammad b. Wasul who had lived in Gao and had been employed in its judiciary. The latter told Ibn Khaldun about devastating struggle over Gao between Mali imperial forces against Berber Tuareg forces from Takedda.|$|E
25|$|A {{powerful}} 15th century Chajoma lord {{was known}} by the name Ichalkan Chi Kumkwat in Nahuatl and Lajuj No'j in Kaqchikel. Around 1450, with Kaqchikel help, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> a rebellion by vassals along the Motagua river. As {{a result of the}} rebellion, this lord left his capital at Och'al Kab'awil Siwan (Pan Och'al in San Martín Jilotepeque) and moved it to Saqik'ajol Kaqapek (Jilotepeque Viejo, the archaeological site known as Mixco Viejo). The Chajoma alliance with the Kaqchikel became more powerful until the Kaqchikels turned on Lajuj No'j and his Chajoma and completely defeated them.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s {{he tried to}} defend Short Brothers {{from the loss of}} work due to the {{suspension}} of work on the de Havilland Comet airliner, which had suffered a series of disasters. The Minister of Supply agreed to try to bring forward other contracts. Support for the local aircraft industry became a regular subject for him to raise. He also pressed for an increase in pensions payable to the disabled, saying that anything less than 90s. per week would be regarded as an instalment by the Royal British Legion in Northern Ireland. In the 1955 budget, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> an amendment to exempt vehicles used by limbless ex-servicemen from purchase tax.|$|E

25|$|He couldn't bat {{himself back}} into {{form in the}} home ODIs against West Indies or on the South Africa tour and was {{expected}} to be dropped for the New Zealand tour given the conditions in that country and the hosts' pace-heavy attack. He was not selected for 2014 Asia Cup in Bangladesh but he selected for the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 same place. Yuvraj performances in the practice matches were major boosts for India ahead of the World T20. In Super10 match against he missed a full delivery and was bowled by the second ball. In both matches, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> what could have been costly misses Chris Gayle and Mohammad Hafeez but India created and converted more chances soon after. His solitary over in the tournament so far went for 13.|$|E
25|$|In 39 or 38 BC, Octavian {{appointed}} Agrippa {{governor of}} Transalpine Gaul, where in 38 <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> a rising of the Aquitanians. He also fought the Germanic tribes, becoming the next Roman general {{to cross the}} Rhine after Julius Caesar. He was summoned back to Rome by Octavian to assume the consulship for 37 BC. He was well below the usual minimum age of 43, but Octavian had suffered a humiliating naval defeat against Sextus Pompey and needed his friend to oversee the preparations for further warfare. Agrippa refused the offer of a triumph for his exploits in Gaul – on the grounds, says Dio, that he thought it improper to celebrate {{during a time of}} trouble for Octavian. Since Sextus Pompeius had command of the sea on the coasts of Italy, Agrippa's first care was to provide a safe harbour for his ships. He accomplished this by cutting through the strips of land which separated the Lacus Lucrinus from the sea, thus forming an outer harbour, while joining the lake Avernus to the Lucrinus to serve as an inner harbor. The new harbor-complex was named Portus Julius in Octavian's honour. Agrippa was also responsible for technological improvements, including larger ships and an improved form of grappling hook. About this time, he married Caecilia Pomponia Attica, daughter of Cicero's friend Titus Pomponius Atticus.|$|E
500|$|Cooper was not {{the first}} to attempt air piracy for {{personal}} gain. In early November 1971, for example, a Canadian man named Paul Joseph Cini hijacked an Air Canada DC-8 over Montana, but was overpowered by the crew when <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> his shotgun to strap on the parachute he had brought with him. Cooper's apparent success inspired a flurry of imitators, mostly during 1972. Some notable examples: ...|$|E

500|$|Denning {{gained a}} first {{in all his}} {{subjects}} except jurisprudence, which he described as [...] "too abstract a subject for my liking". He {{did not return to}} study for a Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL) but instead attempted to gain a [...] "prize fellowship" [...] at All Souls College, Oxford; he failed to be accepted, something <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> to his poor pronunciation of Latin. [...] He was awarded the 1921 Eldon Scholarship.|$|E
500|$|He {{supported}} {{political activist}} and labor leader Thomas Mooney's defense fund, but was repelled by {{the behavior of}} some of Mooney's supporters at a rally. Around the same time, he gave money for a Spanish Republican Army ambulance during the Spanish Civil War, which <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> to being [...] "a soft touch". This donation enhanced his liberal reputation. He also became involved in a [...] "liberal group...with a leftist slant," [...] along with Ronald Reagan. However, when Reagan {{and he saw the}} direction the group was heading, they resigned on the same night.|$|E
500|$|Paton {{spent four}} years at Brunswick preparatory school in Haywards Heath, Sussex before {{studying}} at Cheltenham College. [...] He was a good student, [...] which <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> to an excellent maths teacher, a good memory and [...] being [...] "not much good at games". [...] On Alexander Gibb's advice Paton read for a [...] degree in civil engineering at University College London (UCL), where he had won a scholarship {{at the age of}} 17. [...] Whilst at UCL Paton earned half-colours for long distance running and became the only student to graduate with a first class honours Bachelor of Science degree in engineering in 1925.|$|E

500|$|In December 2011, Uncle David was {{released}} as a Region Free DVD {{by the company}} Peccadillo Pictures, a UK based film distributor of art house, gay and lesbian, independent and world cinema. The release contained several extras, including the three preparatory shorts detailing {{the relationship between the}} characters of Ashley and Uncle David and a cast commentary track voiced by Hoyle, Ryder, Reich and Nicholls. Reviewing the DVD release for the Sex Gore Mutants website, Stuart Willis noted that the disc contained periods of [...] "murkiness or softness in the picture" [...] and a few [...] "(infrequent) instances of muffling", all of which <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> to the original production values of the film. British gay magazine Attitude celebrated the DVD's release with a competition to win one of three copies; they described the film as [...] "a bit surreal, but totally amazing." ...|$|E
500|$|Groza was a {{straight-ahead}} kicker. He {{approached the}} football {{in a straight}} line and booted it with the top of his foot, aiming for the middle of the ball. Early in his career, Groza scraped the ground with his cleats {{in a straight line}} to help guide his kicks. Later <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> a piece of one-inch adhesive tape rolled up inside his helmet. The [...] "Lou Groza Rule" [...] in 1950 banned the use of artificial kicking aids, including the tape. [...] The straight-ahead style used by Groza and other kickers of his era has since been supplanted by soccer-style kicking with the side of the foot. [...] "I don't know why all the kids kick soccer-style", he said in 1997. [...] "They kick the ball with the side of their foot, which is supposed to give them better control. I don't know, I never tried it." ...|$|E
500|$|Despenser {{first heard}} {{news of the}} rising in his own diocese {{at a time when}} he was absent at his manor of Burley in Rutland, [...] west of Norwich. Armed, he hastened back to Norfolk via Peterborough, Cambridge and Newmarket, with a company of only eight lances and a small body of bowmen. His {{followers}} increased on the way, and by the time he reached North Walsham, near the Norfolk coast, he had a considerable force under his command. There he found the rebels entrenched and defended by makeshift fortifications. According to Thomas Walsingham, in the Battle of North Walsham the bishop himself led the assault and overpowered his enemies in hand-to-hand fighting. Many were slain or captured, including the rebels' leader, who was hanged, drawn and quartered soon afterwards. Despenser personally superintended Litster's execution. In the following months he proceeded to deal with other rebels in his diocese. But the rigour with which <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> the rebellion made him highly unpopular in Norfolk and in the following year a plot was organised to murder him. The scheme was betrayed in time by one of the conspirators, and the plotters were dealt with by the authorities.|$|E

500|$|According to Bradman, Morris' {{success was}} due to his {{powerful}} wrists and forearms. Bradman interpreted Morris' unorthodox methods—he often defended with his bat not straight—as a sign of genius. Ian Johnson believed that Morris' idiosyncratic technique was a strength, as it disrupted any plans made by the opposition. Contrary to the accepted wisdom of the day, Morris had a penchant for lofting his drives, backing his ability to clear the infield. Benaud rated Morris alongside Neil Harvey as having the best footwork against spin bowling among batsmen after the Second World War. Morris was particularly known for his fast analysis {{of the length of}} the ball, and as a result, he quickly and decisively moved forward or back. Morris' productivity declined {{in the latter half of}} his career, something <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> to the break-up of his opening pairing with Barnes. Morris' partnerships with his later partners yielded less runs, leading him to remark that [...] "When Siddy [...] went, I lost a lot of support because he'd always get ones." [...] Morris was also known for his unselfishness, often sacrificing his wicket after being involved in mix-ups while running between wickets, and he had a reputation for not attempting to finish not out to inflate his average.|$|E
500|$|A regency {{of three}} {{was elected to}} rule until the five-year-old Dom PedroII {{reached the age of}} {{majority}} and the ability to rule in his own right. One of the regents chosen was Luís Alves' father. The regency had little effective authority, resulting in nine years of chaos, during which the country was plagued by rebellions and coup attempts initiated by unruly political factions. The army, [...] "demoralized by the far from exemplary part it had played in the April Revolution ," [...] said historian C. H. Haring, [...] "became the ready tool of any popular agitator or demagogue, and often the source of riot and sedition." [...] The government severely reduced the size of the standing army and effectively replaced it with the newly created National Guard, a militia force. In July 1831, without troops to command, Luís Alves and other officers joined the Volunteer Soldier-Officers Battalion as soldiers. As second in command of that unit, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> a mutiny of navy artillerymen in the Ilha das Cobras (Island of the Snakes) on 7 October. A year later, on 18 October 1832, he was appointed commander of the Permanent Municipal Guard Corps, a police force in the city of Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
500|$|At {{the time}} of its initial release, Don't Look Now was {{generally}} well received by critics, although some criticised it for being [...] "arty and mechanical". Jay Cocks for Time, wrote that [...] "Don't Look Now is such a rich, complex and subtle experience that it demands more than one viewing", while Variety commented that the film's visual flourishes made it [...] "much more than merely a well-made psycho-horror thriller". Pauline Kael writing for The New Yorker was more reserved in her praise, considering the film to be [...] "the fanciest, most carefully assembled enigma yet put on the screen" [...] but that there was a [...] "distasteful clamminess about the picture", while Gordon Gow of Films and Filming felt that it fell short of the aspirations of Nicolas Roeg's previous two films, Performance and Walkabout, but it was nevertheless a thriller of some depth. Vincent Canby, reviewer for The New York Times, on the other hand, criticised the film for a lack of suspense which <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>down</b> to a twist that comes halfway through rather than at the end, and at which point it [...] "stops being suspenseful and becomes an elegant travelogue that treats us to second-sightseeing in Venice". Canby also suggested that second sight was not convincing on screen, since it appeared simply like flash-forward which is a standard story-telling device in films, and concluded that [...] "Not only do you probably have better things to do, but so, I'm sure, do most of the people connected with the film." ...|$|E
