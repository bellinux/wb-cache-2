40|$|The {{combined}} use of dry cooling air-handler {{and dedicated}} ventilation (DV) system for energy saving and better indoor condition {{has been confirmed}} effective. But the application of this system is hindered by the condensation risk on <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>coil.</b> In this study, the condensation risk {{of the use of}} dry cooling air-handler and dedicated ventilation (DCDV) system in subtropical climates was examined by analysing its application in a typical office building in Hong Kong using actual equipment performance data and realistic system characteristics. Through hour-by-hour simulations {{it was found that the}} annualised cumulative frequency of occurrence of condensation (ConHR) for normal operation of the office building was acceptable. However, departures of the in-use condition from design values are inevitable. Additional parametric studies were therefore performed to evaluate the influence of five design parameters on the ConHR, and to identify the influential factors. By statistical analysis, it was found that ConHR was most sensitive to changes in system latent load, followed by (descending order) system sensible heat ratio, system total load and design moisture absorption coefficient of <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> <b>coil.</b> Furthermore, a regression model relating ConHR to latent load, sensible heat ratio, total load and design moisture absorption coefficient was established for minimising condensation risk during the design of DCDV system.

Accurate temperature and humidity control are essential in semiconductor cleanrooms and high energy consumption steam humidification is commonly used. Therefore, we propose an adiabatic humidification system employing a pressurized water atomizer to reduce the energy consumption. The annual energy consumption of three different HVAC systems were analyzed {{to evaluate the}} applicability of adiabatic humidification.

The energy saving potential of adiabatic humidification over steam humidification has been proved, with savings of 8 % and 23 % in CASE 2 and CASE 3 compared to CASE 1, respectively.

Specifically, this task addresses the ability to successfully fill intact <b>cooling</b> <b>coils,</b> presently within the HLW tanks, with grout that satisfies the fresh and cured grout requirements [1] under simulated field conditions. The overall task was divided into two phases. The first phase was {{the development of a}} grout formulation that satisfies the processing requirements for filling the HLW tank <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> [5].

Data from {{a limited number}} of field studies (Khattar et al. 1985; Henderson and Rengarajan 1996; Henderson 1998) have demonstrated that the moisture removal capacity of a <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> degrades at part-load conditions [...] especially when the supply fan operates continuously while the <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> cycles on and off. Degradation occurs because moisture that condenses on the coil surfaces during the cooling cycle evaporates back into air stream when the coil is off.

This report summarizes the results of a comprehensive project to better understand and quantify the moisture removal (dehumidification) performance of <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> at part-load conditions.

Total, bacterial and fungal DNA concentrations in condensate water produced by a wet coil were also quantified by means of fluorescent dsDNA-binding dye and qPCR assays. Results revealed that the deposition of bioaerosols and total particles is substantial on coil surfaces, especially when wet and cool. The average deposition fraction was 0. 14 for total DNA, 0. 18 for bacterial DNA and 0. 22 for fungal DNA on the dry coil, increasing to 0. 51 for total DNA, 0. 50 for bacterial DNA and 0. 68 for fungal DNA on the wet coil.

A low delta-T may increase the pumping energy consumption and increase the chiller energy consumption. The system studied in this thesis is the chilled water system at the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW Airport). This system has the problem of low delta-T under low cooling loads. When the chilled water flow is much lower than the design conditions at low cooling loads, it may lead to the laminar flow of the chilled water in the <b>cooling</b> <b>coils.</b> The main objective of this thesis is to explain the heat transfer performance of the <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> under low <b>cooling</b> loads. The water side and air side heat transfer coefficients at different water and air flow rates are calculated. The coefficients are used to analyze the heat transfer performance of the <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> at conditions ranging from very low loads to design conditions. The effectiveness-number of transfer units (NTU) method is utilized to analyze the <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> performance under different flow conditions, which also helps to obtain the <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> chilled water {{temperature differential}} under full load and partial load conditions. When the water flow rate drops to 1 ft/s, laminar flow occurs; this further decreases the heat transfer rate on the water side. However, the <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> effectiveness increases with the drop of water flow rate, which compensates for the influence of the heat transfer performance under laminar flow conditions. Consequently, the delta-T in the <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> decreases in the transitional flow regime but increases in the laminar flow regime. Results of this thesis show that the laminar flow for the chilled water at low flow rate is not the main cause of the low delta-T syndrome in the chilled water system.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{need for}} more {{efficient}} air conditioning systems requires an in depth understanding about the performance of its components. One of the key components in the air conditioning plant is the fin-and-tube <b>cooling</b> <b>coil,</b> which is investigated here. The main focus {{of the work is}} concerned with the analysis of fin-and-tube <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> having two classes of passive enhancement techniques known as corrugated and turbulated fins with particular reference of developing flow region. Initially, two-dimensional modelling was done to establish the scope of later three-dimensional modelling in terms of dominant variables, meshing strategies and convergence criteria. The results gave key insights into required modelling strategies needed for the more complex three-dimensional problem of the composite fin-and-tube <b>cooling</b> <b>coil.</b> Three-dimensional CFD modelling of fin-and-tube <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> having turbulated, corrugated and flat-fin geometries have been investigated with particular reference to the dry-hot arid climate. Five modelling approaches have been considered based on an isothermal fin-and-tube, periodic boundaries, conjugate heat transfer, tube-row temperature gradient and the effect of manufacturing defects. The last three approaches are novel contributions to this field of research. The influences of the key design parameters of fin pitch, fin material, and fin thickness have also been investigated parametrically for all fin types. To provide confidence in these models, experimental studies on these <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> were carried out to acquire data for comparison between the predicted and measured values of heat transfer and friction, and to investigate the effect of range of design conditions on the <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> performance. The detailed results of this work can be used to optimise the air-conditioning coil designs. The turbulated fin coil was found to give the highest values of Nusselt number at given friction factor followed by the corrugated fin coil. At a given pressure drop (dP = 52 N/m 2 corresponding to 14, = 2. 3 m/s), the heat transfer coefficient of the corrugated and turbulated fin coils was higher than that of flat fin by 16 % and 36 % respectively. For typical operating conditions, the corrugated and turbulated fin coils required core volumes of 19 % and 40 % less than that of flat fin coil respectively for the same performance. The <b>cooling</b> <b>coils</b> employing corrugated and turbulated fin geometries contribute significantly to the energy conservation and volume reduction of the air conditioning plant...|$|R
40|$|A {{study is}} {{reported}} {{of the potential}} performance of <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> on power generation. This {{is done in the}} context of a generic trough solar thermal power plant. The commercial power plant analysis code GateCycle is applied for this purpose. This code is used to estimate typical performance of both wet and <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> options. Then it is configured to estimate the performance of ideal wet and <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> options. The latter are defined as the condenser temperature being at the ambient wet bulb temperature or dry bulb temperature, respectively. Yearly power production of a solar power plant located in Las Vegas is presented for each of the cooling options. To move further toward approaching the possible improvement in <b>dry</b> <b>cooling,</b> the impact of a high-performance heat exchanger surface is evaluated. It is found that higher efficiency generation compared to current <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> designs is definitely possible. In fact the performance of these types of systems can approach that of wet cooling system units. Solar thermal power <b>Dry</b> <b>cooling</b> Efficiency Flattened-tube surface...|$|R

40|$|Cooling {{tower is}} an {{integrated}} {{part of any}} geothermal power plant because waste heat from turbine exhaust steam must be continuously rejected to make the plants operate. According to the heat dump choice, the cooling system can be classified as wet <b>cooling</b> and <b>dry</b> <b>cooling.</b> <b>Dry</b> <b>cooling</b> towers conduct heat transfer through air-cooled heat exchanger that separates the working fluid from the cooling air. In a <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> tower, air can be introduced by either mechanical draft fans or by natural draft tall tower to move the air across the air-cooled heat exchangers. Ambient condition has {{significant effect on the}} performance of <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> towers. Most geothermal power plants, especially the geothermal power plants using Enhanced Geothermal Systems (EGS) technology, have unique ambient conditions and applications. The Queensland Geothermal Energy Centre of Excellence (QGECE) developed natural draft <b>dry</b> <b>cooling</b> towers (NDDCTs) and steel cooling tower technologies for geothermal power plants...|$|R
40|$|A DX air <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> may {{normally}} {{be assumed to}} have two regions in its refrigerant side, according to refrigerant status, a two-phase region (TPR) and a superheated region (SPR). Dry air side surface of the SPR in a DX air <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> has been normally assumed in lumped-parameter mathematical models previously developed without however being validated. Therefore, an experimental study {{has been carried out}} to examine such an assumption under different operating conditions. The experimental results suggested that the air side surface of the SPR in a DX air <b>cooling</b> <b>coil</b> was either fully or partially wet under all experimental conditions and assuming dry air side of the SPR could lead to an underestimated total amount of water vapor condensed on the entire DX coil surface. Therefore, it is recommended that the assumption of dry air side in a SPR be no longer used in future lumped-parameter models to be developed for improved modeling accuracy.
