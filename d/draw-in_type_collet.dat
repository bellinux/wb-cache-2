25|$|There {{are many}} <b>types</b> of <b>collet</b> {{used in the}} {{metalworking}} industry. Common industry-standard designs are R8 (internally threaded for mills) and 5C (usually externally threaded for lathes). There are also proprietary designs which only fit one manufacturer's equipment. Collets can range in holding capacity from zero to several inches in diameter. The most common <b>type</b> of <b>collet</b> grips a round bar or tool, but there are collets for square, hexagonal, and other shapes. In addition to the outside-holding collets, there are collets used for holding a part on its inside surface {{so that it can}} be machined on the outside surface (similar to an expanding mandrel). Furthermore, it is not uncommon for machinists to make a custom collet to hold any unusual size or shape of part. These are often called emergency collets (e-collets) or soft collets (from the fact that they are bought in a soft (unhardened) state and machined as needed). Yet another <b>type</b> of <b>collet</b> is a step collet which steps up to a larger diameter from the spindle and allows holding of larger workpieces.|$|R

5000|$|The {{smallest}} lathes are [...] "jewelers lathes" [...] or [...] "watchmaker lathes", {{which are}} small {{enough that they}} may be held in one hand. The workpieces machined on a jeweler's lathe are metal. Jeweler's lathes can be used with hand-held [...] "graver" [...] tools or with compound rests that attach to the lathe bed. Graver tools are generally supported by a T-rest, not fixed to a cross slide or compound rest. The work is usually held in a collet. Common spindle bore sizes are 6 mm, 8 mm and 10 mm. The term W/W refers to the Webster/Whitcomb collet and lathe, invented by the American Watch Tool Company of Waltham, Massachusetts. Most lathes commonly referred to as watchmakers lathes are of this design. In 1909, the American Watch Tool company introduced the Magnus <b>type</b> <b>collet</b> (a 10-mm body size collet) using a lathe of the same basic design, the Webster/Whitcomb Magnus. (F.W.Derbyshire, Inc. retains the trade names Webster/Whitcomb and Magnus and still produces these collets.) Two bed patterns are common: the WW (Webster Whitcomb) bed, a truncated triangular prism (found only on 8 and 10 mm watchmakers' lathes); and the continental D-style bar bed (used on both 6 mm and 8 mm lathes by firms such as Lorch and Star). Other bed designs have been used, such a triangular prism on some Boley 6.5 mm lathes, and a V-edged bed on IME's 8 mm lathes.|$|R

The {{raw material for}} the rings of Ball bearing is prepared from a single bar stock using trepanning. Special <b>collet</b> <b>type</b> soft jaw and Mandrels were devised and used on CNC Lathes to reduce manufacturing problems like ovality.

5000|$|A <b>collet,</b> one <b>type</b> of chuck, is {{a sleeve}} with a (normally) {{cylindrical}} inner surface and a conical outer surface. The collet can be squeezed against a matching taper such that its inner surface contracts to a slightly smaller diameter, squeezing the tool or workpiece whose secure holding is desired. Most often this is achieved with a spring collet, made of spring steel, {{with one or}} more [...] cuts along its length to allow it to expand and contract. An alternative collet design is one that has several tapered steel blocks (essentially tapered gauge blocks) held in circular position (like the points of a star, or indeed the jaws of a jawed chuck) by a flexible binding medium (typically synthetic or natural rubber). The Jacobs Rubber-Flex brand is a name that most machinists would recognize for this <b>type</b> of <b>collet</b> chuck system.|$|R
40|$|A {{releasable}} {{coupling device}} for connecting two members {{to one another}} where a <b>collet</b> <b>type</b> fastener has normally retracted latching fingers insertable into a latching recess and a longitudinally movable expander for activating the fastener is described. The longitudinal movement is retained with a paraffin actuated system which can reset. The longitudinal movement of the expander in one direction is through a one way threaded ratchet system which provides an automatic locking action and the expander is movable in either direction by an independently operated threaded action...|$|R
40|$|The {{material}} {{flow in the}} combined extrusion/forging process is an important phenomenon which controls the mechanical and metallurgical properties of any manufactured component. Collet chuck holder is a tool holding device used in different types of CNC milling machines. The chuck holder is described by a flange at the middle {{to fit into the}} machine, taper portion which is conical shaped area present at the bottom which enters the spindle for changing holder and collet pocket which fits the collet for holding the cutting tool. For manufacturing the tool holder an enormous amount of material is being wasted by the machining process which is almost equal to the volume of the product. Some manufacturer use casting, subsequently by machining to get the final shape. Both the used processes have their limitations as discussed earlier. To secure our material resources and to get better mechanical properties it is proposed to adopt the combined extrusion/forging and/or multi-stage processes for the production of different <b>types</b> of <b>collet</b> chuck holders. In general, it is found challenging to predict the metal flow by 3 D combined extrusion/forging process of complicated sections, collet chuck holder in particular, due to its complexity nature of analysis. From experiments it is observed that the complete process to get the first three components can be assumed to compose of four stages and fourth one of two stages with regard to forward/backward extrusion, forging, die corner filling, and flash formation. The mechanical, microscopic, micro hardness and residual stress analyses are performed for all the four components manufactured under different frictional conditions and ram velocities. The results confirm the advantage of the proposed processes to manufacture collet chuck holder. In the present investigation, upper bound method is used to analyze the combined extrusion/forging process of different <b>types</b> of <b>collet</b> chuck holders. A set of kinematically admissible velocity field is proposed to predict the metal flow pattern and the forging load. This work also employed 3 D finite element formulation to simulate the combined extrusion/forging process for axisymmetric collet chuck holders. The forming loads obtained by proposed upper bound technique is in good agreement with the numerical and experimental results and lies in the range of 0 - 15...|$|R
50|$|Like any complex process, {{mistakes}} in handloading {{are easy to}} make. A bullet puller allows the handloader to disassemble mistakes. Most pullers use inertia to pull the bullet; they are shaped like hammers, and the case is locked in place inside. A sharp blow on a hard surface will suddenly stop the case, and the inertia of the heavy bullet will pull it free of the case in a few blows, trapping the powder and bullet {{in the body of}} the puller. <b>Collet</b> <b>type</b> pullers are also available, which use a caliber-specific clamp to grip the bullet, while the loading press is used to pull the case downwards. It is essential that the collet be a good match for the bullet diameter, because a poor match can result in significant deformation of the bullet.|$|R
40|$|AbstractJigs and {{fixtures}} are {{the special}} production tools which make the standard machine tool, more versatile {{to work as}} specialized machine tools. They are normally used in large scale production by semi-skilled operators; however they are also used in small scale production by when interchangeability is important. Various areas related to design of fixture are already been very well described by various renowned authors, {{but there is a}} need to couple and apply all these research works to an industrial application. This paper on “Design and manufacturing of 8 cylinder hydraulic fixture for boring YOKE on VMC – 1050 ” which integrates all these aspects and the evolutionary functional approach of designed fixture is proved from the fact that a real industrial component is considered for fixture designing. In addition of the fixture being hydraulic type, it is also <b>collet</b> <b>type</b> and has expanding customized collet as its main fixturing element. The fixture shows great time saving in the production...|$|R
