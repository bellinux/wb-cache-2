50|$|The {{characterization}} of an ellipse as {{the locus of}} points so that sum of the distances to the foci is constant leads to a method of drawing one using two drawing pins, a length of string, and a pencil. In this method, pins are pushed into the paper at two points, which become the <b>ellipse's</b> <b>foci.</b> A string tied at each end to the two pins and {{the tip of a}} pencil pulls the loop taut to form a triangle.

40|$|By {{exploring}} the four-terminal transmission of a semi-elliptic open quantum billiard in dependence of its geometry and an applied magnetic field, it is {{shown that a}} controllable switching of currents between the four terminals can be obtained. Depending on the eccentricity of the semi-ellipse and the width and placement of the leads, high transmittivity at zero magnetic field is reached either through states guided along the curved boundary or focused onto the straight boundary of the billiard. For small eccentricity, attachment of leads at the <b>ellipse</b> <b>foci</b> can yield optimized corresponding transmission, while departures from this behavior demonstrate the inapplicability of classical considerations in the deep quantum regime. The geometrically determined transmission is altered by the phase-modulating and deflecting effect of the magnetic field, which switches the pairs of leads connected by high transmittivity. It is shown that the elliptic boundary is responsible for these very special transport properties. At higher field strengths edge states form and the multiterminal transmission coefficients {{are determined by the}} topology of the billiard. The combination of magnetotransport with geometrically optimized transmission behavior leads to an efficient control of the current through the multiterminal structure.

40|$|The {{asymptotic}} {{solution of}} the Schrodinger equation with non-separable variables is obtained for a particle confined to an infinite elliptic cylinder potential well under applied uniform longitudinal magnetic field. Using standard-problem method, dimension quantized eigenvalues have been calculated when the magnetic length is large enough {{in comparison with the}} half of the distance between the boundary <b>ellipse</b> <b>focuses.</b> In semi-classical approximation, the confined electron (hole) states are divided into the Boundary States (BS), Ring States (RS), Hyperbolic Caustic States (HCS), and Harmonic Oscillator States (HOS). For large angular momentum quantum numbers and small radial quantum numbers, the BS and RS are grouped into the Whispering Gallery mode. They associate with particles moving along the wire cross section boundary. The motion is limited from the wire core by the elliptic caustic. Consisting of the HCS and HOS, the Jumping Ball modes correspond to the states of particle moving along a wire diameter when the angular momentum quantum number is much less than the radial quantum number. In this case, the motion is restricted by the hyperbolic caustics and two boundary ellipse arcs. For excited hole states in Bi wire, the energy spectrum and space probability distribution are analyzed. Comment: 27 pages, 2 figure...|$|R
40|$|Summary &mdash; Genetic {{variation}} of effective pollen received by individual ramets in a Douglas fir clonal seed orchard was {{not representative of}} the genetic {{variation of}} this clonal seed orchard. This deviation was not due to selfing rate. Effective pollen dispersal might be responsible for this deviation. It was then assessed around 3 individual ramets by comparing genotypes of effective pollen with those of pollinator and surrounding trees located in a circle or in an <b>ellipse</b> <b>focused</b> on the receptor tree. The best prediction of genetic diversity of effective pollen was obtained considering a maximum pollination distance of about 20 - 30 m and an elliptical pollen dispersal. Effective pollen dispersal took place preferentially along rows of trees and probably depended on the wind. As the flowering period was short and particularly synchronous {{in the year of}} seed collection, reproductive phenology probably did not favour some peculiar crosses. Matings between a few neighbour trees was probably the major cause of the homozy-gosity level in seed crop. isozyme / mating system / pollen dispersal / Pseudotsuga menziesii = Douglas fir / surrounding trees Résumé &mdash; Régime de reproduction dans un verger à graines de Douglas (Pseudotsuga men-ziesii (Mirb) Franco.

25|$|The {{reflector}} {{affects the}} quality and directionality of the light output. A reflector is located behind or around the light source {{in such a way}} as to direct more light towards the lens or opening. Each unit has a characteristic reflector, used in conjunction with the lens (or lack thereof) to create the desired effect. An ellipsoidal reflector has a lamp set at one focus point of an ellipsoid-shaped reflector that bounces the light and focuses it at the second focus point of the <b>ellipse.</b> This <b>focuses</b> the beam of light into a tight beam. Ellipsoidal reflectors often are used for tight, focusable spots, although they can be used for floodlights, such as in scoops (see below). A parabolic reflector has a lamp set at the focus point of a parabola-shaped reflector that bounces the light in parallel beams away from the reflector. There is no point at which the light converges, so the light is unfocusable. Parabolic reflectors are used for lights intended to provide an unfocused wash, such as PAR cans.|$|R
