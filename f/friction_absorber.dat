50|$|The Straight Eight is {{provided}} with wire wheels. The springs are half-elliptical, splayed front and back and underhung at the rear and controlled both front and back by <b>friction</b> shock <b>absorbers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|TT-01 - The first Tamiya TT-01 was {{released}} as a Ferrari Enzo in 2003. The original version features a 27T 540 [...] "silver-can" [...] motor, open planetary differentials front and rear, and non-adjustable double wishbone suspension with dry <b>friction</b> shock <b>absorbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{damping force}} of a <b>friction</b> shock <b>absorber</b> is {{adjusted}} with the central pivot and clamping bolt. A star-shaped spring applies a force to the stack of disks. The damping force is roughly proportional to this force and the clamping nut is provided with a pointer arm to indicate the approximate setting.|$|R
50|$|<b>Friction</b> disk shock <b>{{absorber}}s</b> or André Hartford dampers were {{an early}} form of shock absorber or damper used for car suspension. They {{were commonly used}} in the 1930s but were considered obsolete post-war.|$|R
50|$|In 1909 T.B. André, {{owner of}} Hartford <b>Friction</b> disk shock <b>absorbers,</b> {{took control of}} the dealership, and {{introduced}} a new range of larger cars with engines ranging in size between 2210 cc and 3617 cc.|$|R
50|$|Motorcycles of {{the same}} period, through to the 1950s, that used girder forks also used <b>friction</b> disk shock <b>absorbers.</b> These were often {{provided}} with a large handwheel, {{so that they could}} be adjusted easily during a ride, or even whilst in motion.|$|R
50|$|The sidecar was unarmoured, {{with thin}} {{sheetmetal}} {{on the front}} of the sidecar and there was no suspension in the rear of the heavy duty frame. The sidecar was mounted on four leaf springs, and had two <b>friction</b> disc shock <b>absorbers</b> at the back. The Big Four was eventually replaced by the Ford GP or the Willys Jeep in 1941.|$|R
50|$|Lever arm shock {{absorbers}} {{were the first}} form of hydraulic shock absorber or damper used for car suspension. They appeared in the 1930s and were most commonly used in the 1950s and 1960s, but were replaced by telescopic {{shock absorbers}} in the 1970s. One of the earliest patents for a hydraulic lever arm shock absorber was awarded in 1925 to Georges de Ram, who was already an established maker of <b>friction</b> disk shock <b>absorbers.</b>|$|R
50|$|The MG J-type is {{a sports}} car that was {{produced}} by MG from 1932 to 1934. This 2-door sports car used {{an updated version of}} the overhead camshaft, crossflow engine, used in the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 and previously fitted in the MG M-type Midget of 1929 to 1932, driving the rear wheels through a four-speed non-synchromesh gearbox. The chassis was from the D-Type with suspension by half-elliptic springs and Hartford <b>friction</b> shock <b>absorbers</b> all round with rigid front and rear axles. The car had a wheelbase of 86 inches (2184 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm). Most cars were open two-seaters, but a closed salonette version of the J1 was also made, and some chassis were supplied to external coachbuilders. The open cars can be distinguished from the M type by having cut-away tops to the doors.|$|R
5000|$|The car used a tuned short-stroke (73 mm) {{version of}} the bevel gear driven {{overhead}} camshaft engine from the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 with a single SU carburettor and a new crankshaft producing [...] at 6400 rpm. It could from 1932 be had with the crossflow head to be seen later on the MG J-type and a Powerplus supercharger version was also available with [...] at 6500 rpm. Drive was to the rear wheels through a four-speed non-synchromesh gearbox. The chassis was new and {{took the form of}} a ladder frame with tubular cross members and passed under the rear axle. The suspension used half-elliptic springs and Hartford <b>friction</b> shock <b>absorbers</b> with rigid front and rear axles and centre lock wire wheels. The car had a wheelbase of 81 inches (2057 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm).|$|R
5000|$|The car {{used the}} M-Type 847 cc engine that {{was derived from}} the {{overhead}} camshaft engine from the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 with a single SU carburettor producing [...] at 4500 rpm. Drive was to the rear wheels through a three-speed non-synchromesh gearbox with a four-speed gearbox was an option on later cars. The chassis came from the C-Type and took the form of a ladder frame with tubular cross members and passed under the rear axle. The suspension used half-elliptic springs and Hartford <b>friction</b> shock <b>absorbers</b> with rigid front and rear axles and centre lock wire wheels, the brakes were cable operated with eight-inch (203 mm) drums. At 84 inches (2134 mm), 86 inches (2184 mm) after the first 100 cars, the wheelbase was longer than the C-Type to cater for the larger body, but the track remained the same at 42 inches (1067 mm).|$|R
5000|$|Launched at the 1932 London Motor Show, the K-Type {{replaced}} the F-Type Magna but having at first a slightly smaller capacity engine {{it took the}} name Magnette. The chassis {{was similar to the}} Magna but strengthened and had the track increased by 6 inches (150 mm) to 48 inches (1200 mm) and was available in two lengths with a wheelbase of either 94 inches (2388 mm) or 108 inches (2743 mm). The steering was modified with a patented divided track rod which was claimed to reduce kick back at the steering wheel. The brakes were cable operated with 13-inch (330 mm) drums made of [...] "Elektron", a light magnesium alloy, with shrunk in steel liners. Suspension by half-elliptic springs and Hartford <b>friction</b> shock <b>absorbers</b> all round with rigid front and rear axles. Wire wheels with 4.75 x 19 tyres and centre lock fixing were used.|$|R
5000|$|Looking {{for a car}} to {{fill the}} gap between the M-Type Midget and the 18/80, MG turned to another of the engines that had become {{available}} from William Morris's acquisition of Wolseley. This was the 1271 cc 6-cylinder version of the overhead camshaft engine used in the 1929 MG M type Midget and previously seen in the 1930 Wolseley Hornet and had dummy side covers to disguise its origins. Fitted with 1 in twin SU carburettors it produced [...] at 4100 rpm at first, later increased to [...] by revising the valve timing. Drive was to the rear wheels through a four-speed non-synchromesh gearbox of ENV manufacture. The chassis was a 10 in longer version of the one from the MG D-type with suspension by half-elliptic springs and Hartford <b>friction</b> shock <b>absorbers</b> all round with rigid front and rear axles. Wire wheels with 4.00 x 19 tyres and centre lock fixing were used. The car had a wheelbase of 94 in and a track of 42 in.|$|R
5000|$|This 2-door {{sports car}} used {{an updated version}} of the four-cylinder {{bevel-gear}} driven overhead camshaft engine used in the 1928 Morris Minor and Wolseley 10 with a single SU carburettor giving [...] at 4000 rpm.< [...] Drive was to the rear wheels through a three-speed non-synchromesh gearbox. The chassis was based on the one used in the 1928 Morris Minor with lowered suspension using half-elliptic springs and Hartford <b>friction</b> disk shock <b>absorbers</b> with rigid front and rear axles and bolt on wire wheels. The car had a wheelbase of 78 inches (1980 mm) and a track of 42 inches (1067 mm).|$|R
50|$|On {{the trailer}} cars, the trucks {{are similar to}} those of {{ordinary}} passenger cars, but have shorter frames. They lack axlebox guides (the longitudinal movements of the axles relative to the truck frame are limited solely by the suspension springs themselves), the springs are softer, the central pivot is made of 3 segments (which gives it a degree of flexibility), and the axlebox suspension <b>friction</b> shock <b>absorbers</b> are mounted inside the springs (on the power car trucks, they are mounted outside). The leading truck of the driving trailer has brackets for mounting the cab signal receiver coils. The early ER2 trailer cars had KVZ-5/E type trucks (identical to those on the ER1); later examples had the KVZ-TsNII/E type. The latter had the following design changes: the springs were softer; the bolster was attached to the frame by means of 2 swing links with rubber/metallic elements; the weight of the car body was borne by the bolster only via the skid pads (on the earlier type, part of the weight was also borne by the central pivot).|$|R
2500|$|The car {{was fitted}} with a purpose built 18.3-litre V12 engine based on a hybrid of the Sunbeam Manitou and Sunbeam Arab aero engines. [...] This engine had four blocks of three {{cylinders}} arranged in two banks set at 60 degrees (unlike the Arab which were set at 90 degrees). Each cylinder had one inlet and two exhaust valves actuated by a single overhead camshaft. The two camshafts were driven by {{a complex set of}} 16 gears {{from the front of the}} crankshaft - a very similar arrangement to that used on the Maori engine which had two OHC per bank of cylinders. A 4-speed transmission initially drove a back axle with differential with a shaft drive rather than the hazardous chains of other cars. Harry Hawker drove the car in 1920 at Brooklands but suffered a burst tyre, spinning off the circuit. The differential was replaced with a simple crown wheel and pinion so that the rear wheels were locked together and it was more successful in the hands of Kenelm Lee Guinness. Brakes were crude, as was usual in the period, with a foot brake acting on the transmission and a hand brake on the rear drums. Suspension was also typical, with half-elliptic springs all round damped by Andre Hartford <b>friction</b> shock <b>absorbers.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In {{common with}} {{carriages}} and railway locomotives, most early motor vehicles used leaf springs. One {{of the features}} of these springs was that the friction between the leaves offered a degree of damping, and in a 1912 review of vehicle suspension the lack of this characteristic in helical springs was the reason it was [...] "impossible" [...] to use them as main springs. However the amount of damping provided by leaf spring friction was limited and variable according to the conditions of the springs, and whether wet or dry. It also operated in both directions. Motorcycle front suspension adopted coil sprung Druid forks from about 1906, and similar designs later added rotary friction dampers, which damped both ways - but they were adjustable (e.g. 1924 Webb forks). These <b>friction</b> disk shock <b>absorbers</b> were also fitted to many cars.|$|R
40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this work is to {{determine}} the energy losses in the shock absorber of the freight car whose wheel-set moves in the derailed state on the track panel depending on the axle load and structural parameters of spring suspension. Methodology. On the basis of spring suspension construction analysis and operating principle of the <b>friction</b> shock <b>absorber</b> of the freight car bogie the authors provide the method for determining the energy absorbed by it. The calculations take the maximum values of the absorber elements displacement and the regulatory values of spring suspension parameters. Findings. The authors obtained the calculated formula for determining the energy absorbed by shock absorber for regulation-set mounting schemes of elastic bogie elements depending on the axial load. The mentioned curves are parabolic. Originality. The work examines the crash mode of the wheel-set movement on the track panels after its derailment. It is shown that the energy dissipation in the shock absorbers is the reason for increase in resistance to rolling stock movement. The formulas for calculating the amount of energy dissipated in the shock absorber with a maximum displacement of its elements are derived. This energy depends on the axle load and structural parameters of spring suspension. Practical value. The proposed method allows setting the value of the additional resistance to motion that occurs in crash mode which makes it possible to increase the accuracy of traction calculations...|$|R
50|$|Each car {{is mounted}} on the {{bolsters}} of 2 double-sprung 2-axle trucks; the trucks of the power and trailer cars have significant differences. The power car trucks have axlebox guides which prevent any lateral or longitudinal movement of the axles relative to the truck frame. The truck frame's longitudinal beams are reinforced in the middle to take the car's weight via the bolster and suspension springs. The transverse beams have a complex shape to accommodate the traction motors (which are mounted entirely on the truck frame). The truck frame rests on the axleboxes via the axlebox suspension, which consists of 4 coil springs per axlebox (2 on each end of each axle). In turn, the truck frame bears {{the weight of the}} bolster via the double central suspension; the bolster bears the weight of the car directly. The truck frame is additionally reinforced at the attachment points for the suspension swing links. On early trains, the central suspension incorporated elliptical leaf springs, but from 1965 onward they were replaced with coil springs, which increased the maximum suspension travel from 95 to 120 mm (which reduced the risk of bottoming). Both stages of the suspension incorporate shock absorbers: the axlebox suspension has 2 <b>friction</b> shock <b>absorbers</b> per axle, and the central suspension has 5 hydraulic shock absorbers (on trucks with coil springs only). The car body rests on skid pads on the cast side flanges of the bolster; these skid pads are made of layered plastic, and serve to reduce the rolling and yawing movements of the trucks and car bodies. The car body is also connected {{to the center of the}} bolster by means of the central pivot—a vertical steel rod mounted in the center of the bolster, which transmits the traction and braking forces from the truck to the car body, and also receives part of the car body's weight.|$|R
40|$|We {{investigate}} analytically and experimentally {{the effects}} of Coulomb friction {{on the performance of}} centrifugal pendulum vibration absorbers (CPVAs), which are used to reduce torsional vibrations in rotating machinery. The analysis is based on perturbation methods applied to the non-linear equations of motion for a rotor subjected to an engine order applied torque and equipped with a circular path CPVA with viscous and Coulomb damping. The experimental work is based on quantifying parameters for the damping model using free vibration measurements with a viscous and Coulomb damping identication scheme that is enhanced to better handle measurement noise, and running tests for steady-state operation under a range of loading conditions. The level of Coulomb damping is varied by adjusting the <b>friction</b> of the <b>absorber</b> connection bearing. Good agreement is found between the analytical predictions and the experimental data. It is shown that the absorber sticks up to a level of excitation that allows it to release, after which the Coulomb damping acts in the expected manner, resulting in lowered response amplitudes. The results obtained are of general use in assessing absorber performance when dry friction is present in absorber suspensions. ...|$|R
