5000|$|As for his almost polite {{approach}} to the game, Jones believed that anything less would have been downright un-Christian. [...] "If I have to play defense by holding on, that's when I quit," [...] Jones said early in his career. [...] "If I have to use an elbow to get position, then I’m <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> for another position. And if I foul, or if the official makes a mistake, there's no use screaming about it. It won’t change things or make me happier." ...|$|R

60|$|Don Jose obeyed {{the touch}} of the big hairy hand. Decoud {{followed}} out the brothers-in-law. And there remained only one visitor in the vast empty sala, bluishly hazy with tobacco smoke, a heavy-eyed, round-cheeked man, with a drooping moustache, a hide merchant from Esmeralda, who had come overland to Sulaco, riding with a few peons across the coast range. He was very full of his journey, undertaken mostly {{for the purpose of}} seeing the Senor Administrador of San Tome in relation to some assistance he required in his hide-exporting business. He hoped to enlarge it greatly now that the country was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>settled.</b> It was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>settled,</b> he repeated several times, degrading by a strange, anxious whine the sonority of the Spanish language, which he pattered rapidly, like some sort of cringing jargon. A plain man could carry on his little business now in the country, and even think of enlarging it--with safety. Was it not so? He seemed to beg Charles Gould for a confirmatory word, a grunt of assent, a simple nod even.|$|R
60|$|And now {{to grapple}} with it! Now to get it clear! What work was he <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do? That <b>settled,</b> he would deal with his distractions readily enough. Until that was settled he was lax and exposed to every passing breeze of invitation.|$|R

60|$|I {{would have}} been glad to suggest that she might ask me to come again, and it would also have pleased {{me to say that}} I did not believe that her husband, if he could express his opinion, would commend her {{apparent}} inhospitality to his successor.

When Tyler asks Chuck who he is, Chuck says he's from Tyler's record label. Tyler isn't concerned when Chuck says he's protecting him from a death threat. He just wants to party and tosses Chuck's cell phone into the fountain so their partying won't be disturbed by the wringing hands at the label. At the bar, surrounded by a smattering of women, Chuck and Tyler pound back drinks. Tyler shouts to everyone that all the drinks are on his record label and points to Chuck.|$|R
50|$|Outside the town, {{there is}} an old Hindu temple with an {{illegible}} inscription cut in stone. According to the local story, about 700 years ago before Chauhan Ratansing was driven out of Nadol, his family goddess Ashapura commanded him to leave Nadol, and, <b>going</b> westward, <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> in a place where the rope of his wagon should break. Starting off, the rope broke near Tharad. Here he stopped, and, in time, subduing the country round built a temple, calling it in honour of his goddess Nan Devi. The original shrine was probably built in 12th century by Ratansing.|$|R

5000|$|The Amish did {{not believe}} in <b>going</b> <b>to</b> court <b>to</b> <b>settle</b> {{disputes}} but instead follow the biblical command to [...] "turn the other cheek." [...] Thus, the Amish are at a disadvantage when it comes to defending themselves in courts or before legislative committees. However, a Lutheran minister, Reverend William C. Lindholm, took an interest in Amish legal difficulties from a religious freedom perspective and founded The National Committee for Amish Religious Freedom (partly {{as a result of this}} case) and then provided them with legal counsel.|$|R
50|$|Crowfoot was levelheaded in his {{consideration}} of the offerings in the treaty. He {{did not want to}} give up land only to see the white man and the Métis force out and kill the bison. Although, he was aware that the bison were disappearing and that more settlers from the east were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> inevitably <b>settle,</b> with or without a treaty. As long as the bison were there he knew that farming would not even be an option to his people, but he also knew that they would soon be gone. Overall, he had thought that the terms were generally favourable to his people.|$|R
