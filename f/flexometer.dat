40|$|This paper evaluates three {{methods for}} objectively {{measuring}} ROM while workers are wearing protective clothing: a universal goniometer, a Leighton <b>Flexometer,</b> and an electrogoniometer. Ten male subjects performed {{a set of}} nine gross body movements while semi-nude and while wearing each of nine configurations of coveralls. Coveralls varied in relative size and fabric weight. Changes in joint angles were measured simultaneously with the goniometer and the electrogoniometer, and then simultaneously with the <b>Flexometer</b> and the electrogoniometer. The goniometer and <b>Flexometer</b> data were positively correlated across garment treatments, but the electrogoniometer data were not highly correlated with either the goniometer or <b>Flexometer</b> data. Precision was similar between the goniometer and <b>Flexometer,</b> but the goniometer {{was found to be}} much less invasive than the <b>Flexometer...</b>|$|E
40|$|Flexibility is an {{indispensable}} {{component of the}} ability to carry out activities of daily living. The flexibility test proposed by the American Alliance for Health, Physical Education, Recreation and Dance (AAHPERD) is easy to administer and requires little equipment. Thus, the present study sought to ascertain the validity of the flexibility component of the AAHPERD Functional Fitness Assessment in Brazilian older adults. The study sample comprised 330 subjects (278 women and 52 men), {{with a mean age of}} 69. 45 + 6. 19 years, who took part in a physical activity program for older adults. The Leighton <b>Flexometer</b> was chosen as a comparator instrument. The Pearson correlation coefficient (r), simple linear regression, and Bland-Altman plots were used for statistical analysis. The correlation between AAHPERD Functional Fitness Assessment and Leighton <b>flexometer</b> findings was r = 0. 93 and r = 0. 86 (p < 0. 01) for males and females respectively. The AAHPERD Functional Fitness Assessment explained 74. 3 % of variance in Leighton <b>flexometer</b> findings in female participants and 86. 6 % in male participants. We conclude that the flexibility component of the AAHPERD Functional Fitness Assessment provides adequate estimation of lumbar and hip flexibility in Brazilian older adults...|$|E

40|$|One of the {{premature}} {{failures of}} truck and bus tyres {{is associated with}} temperature rise known as blowout that occurs in the thick shoulder regions of the tyre. It occurs due to various dissipative processes under dynamic deformations. The heat produced is sufficiently high to cause thermal degradation that produces volatiles, which consequently exerts internal pressure sufficiently large to tear open a path to the exterior. Blowout failure may cause fatal road accidents. Although the tyre industry {{is aware of the}} problem, research in this area is still inadequate apart from the work conducted by Gent and Hindi in 1988, Choi and Kim in 1998 and Park in 2000. The factors affecting heat generation are still not fully investigated, thus the work presented in this thesis has covered the areas which are not covered by the previous researchers. This includes the work to investigate the effects of glass-transition temperature, Tg of the rubber, partcicle size of the filler, structure of filler, viscosity of process oil and coupling agent on silica-filled vulcanizate on temperature rise and blowout failure. Temperature rise and blowout failure tests were conducted by subjecting a cylindrical test-piece to flexing in a compression <b>flexometer</b> at a constant displacement amplitude in accord with IS 0466 / 3 - 1982. The compression <b>flexometer</b> was modified accordingly to monitor the temperature rise in the interior of the test-piece continuously until the occurrence of blowout failure. Thus this enables the true blowout temperature to be registered. Some of the interesting findings are highlighted in this abstract. In unfilled vulcanized rubber, the temperature rise was found to increase in the increasing order of the Tg of the rubber, NBR>SBR>NR. However, the heat produced was not sufficiently high to cause blowout failure because the heat generated by mechanical work was not sufficiently high either to cause degradation of rubber or to cause breaking of chemical crosslink. In black-filled vulcanizates, temperature rise and blowout were affected by the Tg of the rubber, filler loading, particle size and filler structure. Increasing the Tg, filler loading, filler structure and decreasing the particle size increased temperature rise and shortened the blowout time. The blowout failure was also affected by the process oil. Blowout time was shorter with paraffinic oil than aromatic oil. In the case of silica-filled vulcanized rubber, temperature rise and blowout temperature increased with increasing amount of coupling agent (TESPT) beacuse the hardness increased progressively with increasing TESPT and hence higher dynamic work was required to deform the test-piece at a constant displacement amplitude. The results show that the actual blowout temperature was much higher than the temperature recorded {{at the base of the}} test-piece. The blowout temperature of the interior of the test-piece was 200 °C for NR and 230 - 240 °C for NBR and SBR respectively. These actual blowout temperatures are in good agreement with those reported independently by Gent and Hindi, and that of Choi and Kim...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{relationship}} of flexibility, strength and anthropometric measurements of the lower limbs to the skating speed of hockey players. Seventeen university varsity hockey players were assessed for: leg and grip strengths using cable-tension methods; lower limb flexibility using Leighton?s <b>flexometer</b> and technique; anthropometry of the legs; and skating speed under standing and flying start conditions with and without a stick over two distances, 40 feet and 25 metres. Time was recorded using photoelectric cells and a Universal Counter Timer Model 604 A. The strength, flexibility, and anthropometric measures were the independent variables and the skating speeds were the dependent variables. Using a significance level of. 05 the data were analyzed using the Pearson Product-Moment Correlation Coefficient and Stepwise Multiple Regression statistical methods. The resulting r*s indicated that 1) flexibility was specific to each Joint measured, 2) there was a general strength factor and a general skating body type, 3) two of the skating speed tests encompassed many factors of the other six, 4) flexibility was related to a little degree to strength and anthropometry, 5) strength and anthropometry were related, and 6) flexibility and anthropometry were not related to skating speed.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Recent claims suggest foam rollers {{are useful}} in self-myofascial release and are a {{stretching}} technique used by health care professionals to treat patients {{with a variety of}} soft tissue conditions including muscle tightness. The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine if foam rollers are beneficial in gaining range of motion (ROM) in the hamstring muscle group. DESIGN AND SETTING: All subjects ’ ROM was tested prior to the beginning of the stretching protocol. All stretching routines were performed three times a week in the Mitchell Hall athletic training room. Treatment consisted of three-one minute stretching bouts with a one minute rest between each stretch. The control group was instructed to continue with normal activity, but to perform no additional stretching. SUBJECTS: Twenty-three male and female college students (ages 18 - 32) from the University of Wisconsin- La Crosse participated in this study. All subjects were healthy with no history of recent injury. The criterion for subject inclusion was tight hamstrings as defined by a knee extension range of motion less than 80 ˚. MEASUREMENTS: Active knee extension measurements were determined using an inclinometer and a <b>Flexometer</b> ® before the start of the stretching program, at four weeks and at the conclusion of eight weeks. RESULTS: A doubly multivariate repeated measures analysis was used to interpret the data. The statistical significance was set at p< 0. 05. The analysis showed no significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the treatment and control groups. CONCLUSIONS: No increased range of motion was associated with the use of the foam rollers after the eight week study. Therefore, our findings suggest stretching the hamstrings using foam rollers may not be an effective technique for increasing range of motion in this muscle group...|$|E
