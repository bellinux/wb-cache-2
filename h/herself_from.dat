5|$|Her {{rule was}} finally ended by the {{politician}} Aulus Postumius, after she opted against Roman suppression. Very {{little is known}} {{of the rest of}} her life, but she was eventually succeeded by Gentius in 181 BC. According to the folklore of the modern inhabitants of Risan, Teuta ended her life in grief by throwing <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> Orjen Peak.|$|E

5|$|Michael {{discovers that}} Jan Levinson (Melora Hardin) has artificially inseminated <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> a sperm bank when Kevin runs into {{her at the}} grocery store.

He initially is indecisive, but eventually calls and agrees to attend Lamaze class with her.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the books}} that include the story of Lebrón are The Ladies' Gallery: A Memoir of Family Secrets by Irene Vilar (Lebrón's granddaughter), {{translated}} by Gregory Rabassa (formerly published as A Message from God in the Atomic Age). The author criticizes her grandmother as a distant, gun-toting, larger-than-life figure who cast a veil of pain and secrecy over her family so vast that Ms. Vilar is still untangling <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> it. It also documents the death of Lebrón's only daughter (Vilar's mother) as suicide.|$|E
5|$|By 2000, Madonna {{was dating}} {{director}} Guy Ritchie, and {{was pregnant with}} their child. Wanting to distract <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> the media frenzy surrounding this news, Madonna concentrated {{on the development of}} her eighth studio album, Music. Buoyed up by the commercial success of 1998's Ray of Light album, she was keen on getting back to the studio to record new material. She was then introduced to French DJ and producer Mirwais Ahmadzaï. Madonna instantly liked his pitch-shifting, pulverizing rhythms and his utilization of acid bass in his songs.|$|E

Why--why--why had her mother deserted her in her need? As {{she thought of her}} mother she knew that her plan of rebellion was nothing; but why--why had her mother deserted her? ...|$|R
5|$|Carla {{has brought}} Isabella to the hospital, and {{everyone}} is cooing over the new baby, when Elliot comes in and announces happily that she just bought a new house. Turk exits with Isabella, and Elliot expresses concern that J.D. thinks he's moving into the house with her. Carla has decided to take one year parental leave, and Laverne, Ted, and The Worthless Peons wonder how they can go on at the hospital without Carla's help ("Gonna Miss You, Carla"). Carla begins {{to realize that she}} does not want to separate <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> her work for so long.|$|E
5|$|Cather {{discussed}} her authorship {{privately with}} her father and friends, but otherwise said {{she was not the}} author. She was reluctant to discuss most of her work before O Pioneers! (1913). According to L. Brent Bohlke, editor of Willa Cather in Person (1990), Cather regarded the Eddy book as poorly written. While it contains some excellent writing and character analysis, Bohkle wrote, it is not well-structured; the editing had failed to rid the book of the serialized nature of the McClure's pieces. Stouck adds that Cather wanted to distance <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> journalism, and sought to minimize her role in the articles because they had angered the Christian Science church.|$|E
5|$|Dr. John Markway narrates {{the history}} of the 90-year-old Hill House, which was {{constructed}} by Hugh Crain as a home for his wife. She died when her carriage crashed against a tree as she approached the house for the first time. Crain remarried, but his second wife died in the house from a fall down the stairs. Crain's daughter Abigail lived in the house {{for the rest of her}} life, never moving out of the nursery. She died calling for her nurse-companion. The companion inherited the house, but later hanged <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> a spiral staircase in the library. Hill House was eventually inherited by a Mrs. Sanderson, although it has stood empty for some time.|$|E

5|$|Gestation lasts six {{to seven}} months. Births {{generally}} occur in the midday; the female will isolate <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> the herd when labour pain begins. The perception that females can delay giving birth for an additional month if conditions are harsh may however not be realistic. A single calf is born, and is immediately concealed in cover {{for the first few}} weeks of its birth. The fawn then joins a nursery group within its mother's herd. Calves are suckled for four to six months; young males, forced out of the group, join bachelor herds, while females may stay back.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Strickland {{garnered}} positive critical {{comment for}} the romantic comedy Fever Pitch, and in 2007, {{she was a}} cast regular in the television show The Wedding Bells and subsequently {{was added to the}} cast of Private Practice. Strickland has spoken against the emphasis placed on beauty in the Los Angeles acting community, in which she says her Southern U.S. background has helped to distinguish <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> other blonde-haired actors. She has spoken of an affinity for her strong female characters and a desire to avoid sexualizing or sensationalizing her self-presentation as a woman. She also has worked closely with the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) after participating in a storyline in which her Private Practice character Charlotte King was raped.|$|E
5|$|Marlohe {{had secured}} the role after two auditions for {{director}} Sam Mendes and casting director Debbie McWilliams. She looked to Xenia Onatopp {{as a point}} of inspiration for her performance. Distancing <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> the Bond girl title, she interpreted the character as more modern and realistic. Media commentators characterized Sévérine as a femme fatale and an anti-heroine. Costume designer Jany Temime designed Sévérine's wardrobe using concepts from film noir as well as contemporary fashion, with close attention paid to the black dress she wears when meeting Bond in a Macau casino.|$|E

5|$|Means (Kristen Cloke) is a {{forensic}} psychologist and {{a candidate to}} join the Millennium Group. Like Black, Means has a nearly-supernatural insight into criminal cases (which she attributes to a guardian angel). When Means is prepared for initiation into the group the angelic presence forsakes her, leading to a mental breakdown as she shelters <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> the viral outbreak orchestrated by the group. Means gives Catherine Black her vaccine dose, which she uses to inoculate her daughter Jordan.|$|E
5|$|Shruti's employer, Suryanarayana, {{suggests}} that she marry {{the man she}} loves. To repel Pasupathy's advances, she meets Pandu and proposes to him. After an attack by Narayana's henchmen, who are murdered by Pandu, he reveals {{that he is a}} gangster and {{suggests that}} she might want to rethink her proposal. After Shruti distances <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> Pandu, Pasupathy frames her with a mock sexual assault by a few gangsters unbeknownst to her family and the other villagers. He intends this act to ruin her life and subsequently force her to be his mistress. Learning this, Pandu confronts Pasupathy and warns him that he will face dire consequences if he is found guilty of being involved.|$|E
5|$|The ensuing {{confusion}} allowed Belvidera to fire her stern chasers, killing {{six more}} men aboard President. Rodgers {{kept up the}} pursuit, using his bow chasers to severely damage Belvideras rigging, but his two broadsides had little effect. The crew of Belvidera quickly made repairs to the rigging. They cut loose her anchors and boats and pumped drinking water overboard to lighten her load, thereby increasing her speed. Belvidera soon gained enough speed to distance <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> President, and Rodgers abandoned the pursuit. Belvidera sailed to Halifax to deliver the news that war had been declared.|$|E

5|$|The first {{manslaughter}} {{charge was}} in March 1888, when Abby H. Corner, a practitioner in Medford, Massachusetts, attended {{to her daughter}} during childbirth; the daughter bled to death and the baby did not survive. The defense argued {{that they might have}} died even with medical attention, and Corner was acquitted. To the dismay of the Christian Scientists' Association (the secretary resigned), Eddy distanced <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> Corner, telling the Boston Globe that Corner had only attended the college for one term and had never entered the obstetrics class.|$|E
5|$|Thumbelina {{tries to}} protect <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> the elements, but when winter comes, {{she is in}} desperate straits.

The mouse suggests Thumbelina marry her neighbor, a mole, but Thumbelina finds repulsive {{the prospect of being}} married to such a creature because he spent all his days underground and never saw the sun or sky. The field mouse keeps pushing Thumbelina into the marriage, saying the mole is a good match for her, and does not listen to her protests.|$|E
5|$|Torres {{sings the}} second verse, telling Selena {{that he will}} wait for her, {{reasoning}} that he likes having an illusion and believing that she loves him. He then tells her he does not care how long he has to wait. Selena replies, telling him how beautiful his responses are, which makes her feel she is falling in love. Selena states that she stops <b>herself</b> <b>from</b> making a mistake that could hurt her. Torres and Selena repeat the song's chorus before the song concludes.|$|E
