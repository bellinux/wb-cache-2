He {{was also}} an {{innovative}} guitarist, using extended techniques and exploring the musical and sonic possibilities of dissonance, distortion, feedback, the echo machine, tapes and other effects; his experimentation was partly inspired by free improvisation guitarist Keith Rowe of the group [...] AMM, active {{at the time in}} London. One of Barrett's trademarks was playing his guitar through an old <b>echo</b> <b>box</b> while sliding a Zippo lighter up and down the fret-board to create the mysterious, otherworldly sounds that became associated with the group. Barrett was known to have used Binson delay units to achieve his trademark echo sounds. Daevid Allen, founder member of Soft Machine and Gong, has cited Barrett's use of slide guitar with echo as a key inspiration for his own [...] "glissando guitar" [...] style.|$|E
2500|$|Lynott {{then left}} the family home and moved into a flat in Clontarf, where he briefly joined 'Kama Sutra'. It was in this band that he learned his {{frontman}} skills, and worked out how to interact with an audience. In early 1968, he teamed up with bassist Brendan 'Brush' Shiels to form Skid Row. Shiels also wanted Brian Downey to play drums in the band, but Downey wasn't interested in the band's style, so the job went to Noel Bridgeman instead. The band signed a deal with Ted Carroll, who would later go on to manage Thin Lizzy, and played a variety of covers including [...] "Eight Miles High", [...] "Hey Jude" [...] and several numbers by Jimi Hendrix. Because Lynott did not play an instrument {{at this point in}} his career, he instead manipulated his voice through an <b>echo</b> <b>box</b> during instrumental sections. He also took to smearing boot polish under his eyes on stage, which he would continue to do throughout Lizzy's career later on, and regularly performed a mock fight with Shiels onstage to attract the crowd. In mid 1968, guitarist Bernard Cheevers quit to work full-time at the Guinness factory in Dublin, and was replaced by Belfast-born guitarist Gary Moore.|$|E

50|$|In 1910 {{the only}} {{significant}} changes {{were made to the}} instrument with the replacement of Schulze’s “borrowed” solo manual with an independent department in its own swell box. Another new swell-box was provided for the echo organ making it in the words of Magnus Black “inaudible above the traffic except {{in the early hours of}} the morning”. The <b>echo</b> swell <b>box</b> shutters have since been removed! A large leathered No1 Diapason, standing in its own separate chest, was added to the Great at this time. It was removed in 1959.|$|R
25|$|Following {{the work}} of Jimi Hendrix in the late 1960s, black funk artists such as Sly and the Family Stone pioneered a style known as {{psychedelic}} funk by borrowing techniques from psychedelic rock music, including wah pedals, fuzz <b>boxes,</b> <b>echo</b> chambers, and vocal distorters, as well as blues rock and jazz. In the following years, groups such as George Clinton's Parliament-Funkadelic continued this sensibility, employing synthesizers and rock-oriented guitar work.|$|R
50|$|At CSIRO Radiophysics Laboratory, {{work that}} in 1942-1945 was {{classified}} {{appeared in a}} dozen reports. Activities included design, construction, and demonstration of voice-modulation equipment for a 10 cm magnetron (July 1943), a microwave triode oscillator at 25 cm using cylindrical cavity resonators, equipment designed for microwave radar in field use (wavemeter, <b>echo</b> <b>box,</b> thermistor power meter, etc.) and microwave measurement technique. Experience with numerical computation of fields in cavities led, after the war, to a Master of Engineering degree (1948) and the definitive publication on step discontinuities in radial transmission lines (1954).|$|E
50|$|The South Fork of the Humboldt River has {{its origins}} in a fan-shaped group of canyons {{draining}} the western slopes of the Ruby Mountains in northeastern Nevada. These headwaters run from Ruby Dome south to King Peak, and include <b>Echo,</b> <b>Box,</b> Kleckner, North Furlong, Long, Segunda, Drown, and Rattlesnake Canyons. Streams draining these canyons exit the mountains and converge at an elevation of 5775 ft, {{near the town of}} Lee and within the tribal lands of the Te-Moak tribe of the South Fork Band of the Western Shoshone.|$|E

5000|$|The {{band played}} a few live shows in early 2013, {{including}} Soundwave Music Festival in Australia and Lollapalooza Chile, though Keenan {{reported that they}} had still yet to complete any new tracks due to their other commitments. Later in the year, the band announced two separate compilation releases for November 2013. The first, a greatest hits album entitled Three Sixty, containing one new studio recording, [...] "By and Down", and the second, a box set entitled A Perfect Circle Live: Featuring Stone and <b>Echo.</b> The <b>box</b> set contained four CDs of live music: one for each of their three entire-album performances of Mer de Noms, Thirdteenth Step, and Emotive done in 2010, collectively dubbed Trifecta, and a recording of their 2011 performance at the Red Rocks Amphitheatre, dubbed Stone and Echo. The set also came with DVD video recording of the 2011 Stone and Echo performance. In promoting the releases, Howerdel commented on future releases once again, stating that he felt they had [...] "75% of the foundation of next A Perfect Circle record ready", though he conceded that they were still without Keenan's lyrics or vocal melodies, and could still change depending on Keenan's reaction to the material. He also conceded that they still disagreed on the release medium; Keenan preferred smaller releases, while Howerdel preferred the format of a full album. Shortly after, the band again fell into a few years of public inactivity, with little occurring outside of Howerdel's 2015 commentary reiterating his commitment to the band, and Keenan's early 2016 commentary reiterating he still hoped to return to the band.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{the late}} 1960s work of Jimi Hendrix, psychedelia {{began to have}} a {{widespread}} impact on African American musicians. [...] Black funk artists such as Sly and the Family Stone borrowed techniques from psychedelic rock music, including wah pedals, fuzz <b>boxes,</b> <b>echo</b> chambers, and vocal distorters, as well as elements of blues rock and jazz. In the following years, groups such as Parliament-Funkadelic continued this sensibility, employing synthesizers and rock-oriented guitar work into open-ended funk jams. Producer Norman Whitfield would draw on this sound on popular Motown recordings such as The Temptations' [...] "Cloud Nine" [...] and Marvin Gaye's [...] "I Heard It Through the Grapevine."Subsequent artists would {{be influenced by the}} style including Prince. In the early 1970s, jazz artists such as Miles Davis and Herbie Hancock combined elements of psychedelic funk with urban jazz to pioneer jazz fusion. Influenced by George Clinton, new wave band Talking Heads explored psychedelic funk in collaboration with producer Brian Eno on a trilogy of acclaimed albums in the late 1970s. [...] In recent years, examples of psychedelic funk from world music scenes have been collected on compilations issued on the World Psychedelic Funk Classics label.|$|R
5000|$|Being an {{expensive}} album the producers {{were able to}} make early use of an eight-track professional reel-to-reel recorder, which was used to mix second generation four-track tape that had been transferred from another four-track recording for overdubs. This was during an era when most studios were still limited to four-track machines. Parks has added that the bulk of the album was done [...] "before Sgt. Pepper reared its ugly head", and that Randy Newman had written [...] "Vine Street" [...] especially for him. Many Los Angeles recording facilities were used, not because of any particular sound preference, but to maximize studio time. Song Cycle contained experimental production and recording methods, including varispeed and regenerated tape delay. Audio engineer Bruce Botnick is credited for inventing the [...] "Farkle" [...] effect, an ingenious modification to a Sunset Sound Recorders <b>echo</b> <b>box.</b> The Farkle effect was used most prominently on violins, harps, and the intro to [...] "The All Golden", and involved very thin splicing tape folded like a fan attached to a tape overhead.|$|E

500|$|Upon release, {{the album}} was well {{received}} by reviewers. Sounds gave Join Hands a grade of 4.5 out of 5, with the reviewer, Pete Silverton, noting {{a change in the}} sound: [...] "The mix is different to the last album. Now there's a clarity which frames Sue's voice like it was a thing of treasure". Silverton also wrote that some of the songs have [...] "Siouxsie's voice double-tracked with devastating effect". Jon Savage, a Melody Maker reviewer, described the first track, [...] "Poppy Day", as a [...] "short, powerful evocation of the Great War graveyards in Flanders". He also wrote that [...] "Placebo Effect" [...] "has a stunning flanged guitar intro, chasing clinical lyrics covering some insertion or operation". About [...] "Icon", Savage wrote: [...] "The brilliantly reverbed guitar is a perfect foil for Siouxsie's soaring and, for once, emotional vocal." [...] Savage noted that the five songs of the first side [...] "rise and fall into another in a stunning segue". Similarly, Paul Morley [...] wrote in NME that [...] "Side one's five songs [...] are all addictive Banshees mini-dramas". Ronnie Gurr, a Record Mirror reviewer, also hailed the record, saying: [...] "Poppy Day establishes the band's perfect employ of atmospherics and sets the tone of all the tracks". [...] "Mother" [...] was compared to the soundtrack of an Alfred Hitchcock film, with Gurr noting that the [...] "track features a musical <b>box,</b> <b>echoes</b> menacing guitar grumblings and Siouxsie providing vocals that would befit any of Hitchcock's best matricides". Gurr concluded that with [...] "Severin's truly disturbing scratchings", Join Hands was a dangerous work that [...] "should be heard".|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} {{improving}} the accuracy of measuring the velocity and time of flight of ultrasonic signals through moving web-like materials such as paper, paperboard and the like, includes a pair of ultrasonic transducers disposed on opposing sides of a moving web-like material. In order to provide acoustical coupling between the transducers and the web-like material, the transducers are disposed in fluid-filled wheels. Errors due to variances in the wheel thicknesses about their circumference which can affect time of flight measurements and ultimately the mechanical property being tested are compensated by averaging the ultrasonic signals for a predetermined number of revolutions. The invention further includes a method for compensating for errors resulting from the digitization of the ultrasonic signals. More particularly, the invention includes a method for eliminating errors known as trigger jitter inherent with digitizing oscilloscopes used to digitize the signals for manipulation by a digital computer. In particular, rather than cross-correlate ultrasonic signals taken during different sample periods as is known in the art {{in order to determine}} the time of flight of the ultrasonic signal through the moving web, a pulse <b>echo</b> <b>box</b> is provided to enable cross-correlation of predetermined transmitted ultrasonic signals with predetermined reflected ultrasonic or echo signals during the sample period. By cross-correlating ultrasonic signals in the same sample period, the error associated with trigger jitter is eliminated. Institute Of Paper Science And Technology, Inc...|$|E
