40|$|Alumino-silicate <b>fireclay</b> <b>material</b> {{was found}} within the {{equatorial}} region of Ekiti state of Nigeria. From Ijero-Ekiti, fireclay samples were explored, exploited and developed into automobile brake pads. Eight samples were taken from 5 to 30 metres downward at various pits to prevent unwanted foreign materials. Specifically, these samples were examined and found to be characteristically homogeneous in physical, mechanical, mineralogical and chemical composition. 30 per cent of the unwanted foreign materials from the fireclay were technically removed with above 45 micron sieve using a wet sieving method. 70 per cent of the purified clay of less than 45 micron sieve was eventually used as beneficiated <b>fireclay</b> <b>material.</b> After the purification, sample clay obtained was finally calcined at 15000 C temperature for clay structural stability and prevention of excessive clay shrinkage. The refractory clay material was eventually made into various is batches using a mathematical model. Material composition fomula used was technically based on range of grain particle sizes (30 to 70 per cent) grog or calcined clay; and beneficiated clay {{range of particle sizes}} of 70 to 30 per cent as the binding agent respectively. Thereafter, batch material compositions were homogeneously mixed and properly wedge together in a pugged mill before they were hydraulically pressed with 1000 kg/mm 2 with a designed steel mould. Automobile brake pads made were characteristically tested and found suitable for light (Cars) vehicles usage 80 per cent efficiency...|$|E

The {{following}} year Fireclay developed its own product line, called Colonia, which consisted of 4x4 and 6x6 tiles and corresponding trim pieces. In 1988 Fireclay began to manufacture their own glazes, and made the choice {{to do so without}} lead, making Fireclay a pioneering company as far as environmentalism.Using locally ubiquitous <b>materials,</b> <b>Fireclay</b> partnered with their Aromas factory neighbor, Granite Rock in 1997. Difficult to repurpose excess granite dust then became a key ingredient in the recycled clay body, which was launched in 1998. Twelve years later in 2010, the introduction of Project Porcelain marked another key initiative in Fireclay's continued efforts to turn trash into treasure. Their latest innovation, the Cathode Ray Tube tile, was introduced in 2013, and released to the market in 2014. The project of converting CRT to tile expanded an already impressive recycling repertoire by inventing a way to utilize copious amounts of electronic refuse.|$|R
