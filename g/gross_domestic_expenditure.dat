40|$|Abstract. The paper validates the {{relations}} between the share of public and private R&D spending and the effectiveness of national R&D sector. It states that in order to implement effective and profitable “high-tech policy”, governments have to intensify the share of business sector in <b>Gross</b> <b>Domestic</b> <b>Expenditures</b> on R&D. At the same time it is necessary to preserve the definite “government share ” in R&D investments, as reduction of it up to certain extent gives the negative effect...|$|R
25|$|Between 2000 and 2008, <b>Gross</b> <b>Domestic</b> <b>Expenditures</b> on Research and Development (GERD) rose by {{an average}} of 22.8% annually, which {{increased}} the share of GERD to GDP from 0.9% to 1.54%. China aims to increase this to 2.5% by 2020 and in 2016 it reached just over 2%. In 2008 82.76% went to experimental development, 12.46% to applied research, and 4.78% to basic research. Business enterprises contributed 59.95% of GERD in 2000 and 73.26% in 2008. Spending by enterprises is predominantly on experimental development. China aims to increase basic research's share to 15% by 2020.|$|R
2500|$|Brazil’s {{economic}} boom between 2004 and 2012 translated into higher {{government and business}} spending {{on research and development}} (R). <b>Gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>expenditure</b> on R (GERD) almost doubled to PPP$35.5 billion (in 2011 dollars). Most of this growth occurred between 2004 and 2010, when GERD climbed from 0.97% to 1.16% of GDP. In 2012, GERD stood at 1.15% of GDP. Since 2010, the government sector alone has been driving up R intensity, since the non-government contribution has actually declined from 0.57% to 0.52% of GDP (2012). Preliminary figures for 2013 indicate slight growth in government spending and a constant contribution from the business sector (relative to GDP). Business research expenditure is likely to contract from 2015 onwards until the economy shows signs of recovery. Even the most optimistic analysts do not expect this to happen before 2016. Fixed capital investment in Brazil is expected to decline further in 2015, especially in the manufacturing sector. This trend will certainly affect industrial research spending. The Petrobrás crisis is expected to {{have a major impact on}} investment in R, since it alone has accounted for about 10% of the country’s annual fixed capital investment in recent years. The cuts to the federal budget announced in 2015 and other austerity measures should also affect government spending on R ...|$|E

40|$|Countries with a {{high amount}} of {{knowledge}} capital {{are likely to have}} higher volumes of venture capital (VC) investments because more researchers come up with innovative business ideas that require venture capital finance. Using panel data techniques, the paper finds evidence that VC investments depend strongly on the countries' knowledge capital measured by the number of patents, or the number of R&D researchers, or <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>expenditures</b> on R&D. In addition, the paper analyzes whether government-financed knowledge capital fulfills a special role for VC investments. It finds only weak evidence that VC investments depend, with a delay of several years, on government-financed knowledge capital.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the development of}} astronomy and astrophysics research productivity in Turkey in terms of publication output and their impacts {{as reflected in the}} Science Citation Index (SCI) for the period 1980 - 2010. It includes 838 refereed publications, including 801 articles, 16 letters, 15 reviews, and six research notes. The number of papers were prominently increased after 2000 and the average number of papers per researcher is calculated as 0. 89. Total number of received citations for 838 papers is 6938, while number of citations per papers is approximately 8. 3 in 30 years.

40|$|In {{this study}} of Ghana {{integrated}} to the world economy, we focus primarily on Ghana-UK-Germany trade axis partly because of Ghana?s relative dependence on the EU for her international trade. The study employs ?representative? country macroeconometric models of these economies, using data over 1970 - 1991, including bilateral trade links among them and with the USA and Japan, to quantitatively analyze and draw policy inference of the international transmission mechanism of macroeconomic disturbance effects in the trade axis. Specifically, the study addresses the issue: how does external economic perturbations in the EU in particular influence Ghana?s policy goals of GDP and bilateral export growth, the nominal current account and inflation; and, which Ghanaian fiscal policy instruments are most influential in enhancing these policy goals in the liberalized world economy. The Ghanaian side of the model developed is characterized by interaction of supply components of agriculture, industry and services and the demand components of <b>gross</b> <b>domestic</b> <b>expenditures,</b> implicitly considering the input-output type of production process. Thus supply-side responses are incorporated into the Ghanaian model since output growth is {{a major determinant of}} exports and is relevant for the Ghanaian side of the trade linkage. The economies in the model are linked through trade flows and prices. Ghana is not an export competitor to UK, Germany, USA or Japan. However, she competes with other non-oil developing economies in the markets covered here. Hence Ghana?s export price relative to the non-oil developing countries are crucial in the Ghanaian trade flows. Real exchange rates confronting Ghanaian export, foreign import and export price as well as domestic price structures influence Ghana?s export price and are factored into the Ghanaian model. In addition the interaction of an aggregated export and import tax are brought explicitly into the model...|$|R
