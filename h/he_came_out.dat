5|$|During the 1952 Winter Olympics, Rødkleiva {{hosted the}} men's slalom and the women's slalom, {{with the other}} events taking place at Norefjell. The {{organizing}} committee had set up 15,000 tickets for the men's discipline on 19 February, but between 25,000 and 30,000 people attended the race, the surplus who did not pay for tickets. The large popularity was to see Norway's favoured Stein Eriksen. Although leading after the first heat, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of balance {{in the second and}} finished second behind Austria's Othmar Schneider. The women's race held the following day was won by the American Andrea Mead-Lawrence.|$|E
5|$|Hindman joined Confederate {{refugees}} in the Mexican town of Carlota, where he engaged in coffee planting and attempted to practice law. By April 1867, he was confident enough in the situation at home to return to Arkansas and apply to President Andrew Johnson for a pardon. Hindman's application {{was one of the}} few denied; nonetheless, he attempted to return to his former life. Politics still called to him and, although ineligible to run for office, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> against the Reconstruction Constitution, which put him in direct conflict with reconstruction authorities. These authorities revived a treason indictment against him and had him arrested. This did not stop Hindman, who went on the political circuit and had some success building an unlikely coalition of newly freed slaves and Democrats.|$|E

Jim Thorpe, who was later {{inducted}} into the Pro Football Hall of Fame, started the game for the Bulldogs, but <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> at halftime because he believed it would end in a tie. Both teams were slowed by a muddy field, and the football became soggy after three quarters. Neither the All-Americans nor the Bulldogs could gain a lot of yards during the game. The lone score of the game came with under four minutes to play: a field goal from the Bulldogs' Al Feeney. He never missed a field goal the entire 1920 season, and the final score of the game was 3–0.|$|E
5|$|Michael Hart {{arrived in}} Lyttelton {{with his wife}} and their two sons on the Cressy on 27 December 1850, one of the First Four Ships {{reaching}} Canterbury.

The hotel opened on 15 November 1851, {{less than a year after}} the organised settlement of Christchurch. In December 1852, Hart catered for 150 guests who had assembled to farewell John Robert Godley, the founder of Canterbury who returned to England after his short stay in the colony. A well-known man, Hart had no political experience; he was never elected onto the Canterbury Provincial Council.|$|E

5|$|Word about Barrymore's {{problems}} {{on and off}} the set spread around the industry, and he did not work on another film for over a year, when he had a supporting role in the musical film Maytime. His divorce from Costello was finalized in October 1936, and he married Barrie in November the same year. The couple had a heated argument in public shortly afterwards, and he again spent time in Kelley's Rest Home and hospital, which cost him an average of $800 daily, draining his finances. When <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out,</b> he collapsed on the Maytime set. On January 15, 1937, he was served with divorce papers, and a month later he filed for bankruptcy protection, with debts of $160,000. The divorce was granted in April, but the couple reconciled before it was finalized.|$|E
5|$|Adamle {{grew up in}} Cleveland, Ohio and was a star fullback on his Collinwood High School {{football}} team. He attended Ohio State University in 1942, but {{his college}} career was cut short by World War II. After {{a stint in the}} U.S. Air Force, Adamle returned to finish his education at Ohio State in 1946. He soon dropped out of school, however, and joined the Browns. Cleveland won AAFC championships in each of Adamle's first three years, after which the league folded and the Browns were absorbed by the more established NFL. Cleveland continued to succeed in the NFL, winning the 1950 championship and advancing to the 1951 championship but losing to the Los Angeles Rams. Adamle left the Browns after the 1951 season to pursue a medical degree, but <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of retirement briefly in 1954 as the Browns won another NFL championship.|$|E
5|$|After the , (his 19th with Santos), Pelé {{retired from}} Brazilian club {{football}} although {{he continued to}} occasionally play for Santos in official competitive matches. Two years later, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of semi-retirement to sign with the New York Cosmos of the North American Soccer League (NASL) for the 1975 season. Though well past his prime at this point, Pelé was credited with significantly increasing public awareness and interest of the sport in the United States. Hoping to fuel {{the same kind of}} awareness in the Dominican Republic, he and the Cosmos team played in an exhibition match against Haitian team, Violette AC, in the Santo Domingo Olympic Stadium on 3 June 1976, where over 25,000 fans watched him score a winning goal in the last seconds of the match, leading the Cosmos to a 2–1 victory.

5|$|At 8:00 on {{the morning}} of the Test, there was a storm to the south of London but the rain did not reach Lord's, which was located in the north of the English capital. The first over bowled by Bedser to Barnes was watchfully played to {{complete}} a maiden. The debutant Coxon opened the bowling with Bedser and he removed Barnes for a duck in his second over, caught by Hutton at short fine leg from a short delivery to leave Australia 3/1. Barnes tried to knock the ball through square leg but misjudged the pace of the wicket and played his shot too early, mishitting the ball to Hutton. Coxon bowled from very close to the wickets and left substantial footmarks just outside the right-hander's leg stump in an area ideal for a leg spinner. Although he was not of particularly fast pace, Coxon ran in vigorously and landed heavily after a pronounced delivery stride, making a significant impact on the surface. Bradman received a loud, positive reception from the crowd as <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> to bat in his final Test at Lord's.|$|E
5|$|Barnes {{fell for}} a duck {{in his second}} over, {{bringing}} Bradman to the crease at 1/3. Bradman received a loud reception from the crowd as <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> to bat in his final Test at Lord's. Bradman initially struggled against the English bowling. He faced his first ball from Alec Coxon and inside edged it past his leg stump, before missing the third ball from Coxon and surviving an appeal for leg before wicket (lbw). Bowling from the other end, Bedser beat Bradman with seam movement off the pitch and the ball narrowly skimmed past the stumps. Standing up to the stumps, wicket-keeper Godfrey Evans removed the bails as Bradman leaned forward, but his foot had stayed firmly behind the crease. In another close call, Bradman inside edged a ball towards Yardley at short leg, but the English captain was slow to react and the ball landed in front of him. The Australian captain managed only three runs in the first twenty minutes as Australia had only 14 after the first half-hour. Coxon consistently moved the ball into a cautious Bradman, and the Australians scored only 32 runs in the first hour.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's seventh film, The Public Enemy, {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} gangster movies of the period. Notable for a famous scene in which Cagney pushes a grapefruit against Mae Clarke's face, the film thrust him into the spotlight. He {{became one of}} Hollywood's biggest stars and one of Warner Bros.' biggest contracts. In 1938, he received his first Academy Award for Best Actor nomination, for Angels with Dirty Faces, for his subtle portrayal of the tough guy/man-child Rocky Sullivan. In 1942, Cagney won the Oscar for his energetic portrayal of George M. Cohan in Yankee Doodle Dandy. He was nominated a third time in 1955 for Love Me or Leave Me. Cagney retired from acting and dancing in 1961 to spend time on his farm with his family. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of retirement 20 years later for a part in the movie Ragtime (1981), mainly to aid his recovery from a stroke.|$|E

5|$|In 1949, Ray married Bijoya Das, {{his first}} cousin and long-time sweetheart. The couple had a son, Sandip, {{who is now}} a film {{director}}. In the same year, French director Jean Renoir came to Calcutta to shoot his film The River. Ray helped him to find locations in the countryside. Ray told Renoir about his idea of filming Pather Panchali, which had long been on his mind, and Renoir encouraged him in the project. In 1950, D.J. Keymer sent Ray to London to work at its headquarters office. During his three months in London, Ray watched 99 films. Among these was the neorealist film Ladri di biciclette (Bicycle Thieves) (1948) by Vittorio De Sica, which {{had a profound impact on}} him. Ray later said that <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of the theatre determined to become a film-maker.|$|E
5|$|López {{suffered}} from shoulder problems during spring training in 1982, {{and he was}} demoted to Detroit's Class AAA minor-league affiliate in Evansville by July. He was called back up to Detroit on September 1, but later that month he shocked his teammates by announcing that he was giving up his MLB career and returning to Mexico. López said that his reasons were personal, and he cited his family, the education of his children and the Mexican economy as motivating factors for the decision. <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of retirement and returned to Detroit {{in time for the}} 1983 season. In February 1983, López became the first player in MLB history to receive a pay cut through salary arbitration. López had earned $285,000 in 1982, asked for $315,000 for 1983 and was awarded $250,000. He finished 1983 with a 98 record, 2.81 ERA and 18 saves.|$|E
5|$|Three legends are narrated to the {{establishment}} of the monastery. In the first legend it is said that location of the present Monastery was selected by a horse which belonged to Merag Lama Lodre Gyatso who was on a mission assigned to him by the 5th Dalai Lama to establish a Monastery. After an intense search, when he failed to locate a suitable place, he retired into a cave to offer prayers seeking divine intervention to choose the site. When <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>out</b> of the cave, he found his horse missing. He then went in search of the horse and finally found it grazing {{at the top of a}} mountain called Tana Mandekhang, which in the past was the palace of King Kala Wangpo. He took this as a divine and auspicious guidance and decided to establish the monastery at that location. Seeking the help of the local people, Mera Lama established the monastery at that location in the latter part of 1681.|$|E
