5|$|Additionally, {{there can}} be {{confusion}} between the various water <b>hemlock</b> species and poison <b>hemlock</b> (Conium maculatum) as the common name <b>hemlock</b> is applied to both Cicuta and Conium maculatum. Both are poisonous and can be differentiated by differences in their root structure. Water <b>hemlock</b> has a branched root systems with tubules, while poison <b>hemlock</b> has a single tap root. Another reliable method to identify water <b>hemlock</b> {{is to examine the}} leaf veins. Water <b>Hemlock</b> is unique in the Apiaceae family in that it has leaf veins which terminate in the notches between the leaf tips, rather than extend to the tip of the leaf, as is found in the leaf structure of other members of this family.|$|E
5|$|Predators {{including}} Cactoblastis cactorum (mentioned above) {{can also}} be used to destroy invasive plant species. As another example, the poison <b>hemlock</b> moth (Agonopterix alstroemeriana) can be used to control poison <b>hemlock</b> (Conium maculatum). During its larval stage, the moth strictly consumes its host plant, poison <b>hemlock,</b> and can exist at hundreds of larvae per individual host plant, destroying large swathes of the <b>hemlock.</b>|$|E
5|$|Boreal {{forest trees}} such as black spruce, paper birch, and {{tamarack}} inhabit wetlands in the watershed of Roaring Brook.

50|$|Although not {{preferred}} by the larvae, pines and <b>hemlocks</b> {{are subject to}} heavy defoliation during gypsy moth outbreaks {{and are more likely}} to be killed than hardwoods.

5|$|Members of {{the family}} Apiaceae bear close {{resemblance}} to each other, and have many characteristics in common. Cicuta spp. are often mistaken for edible plants such as kvanne (Angelica archangelica), wild celery (Apium graveolens), pignut (Conopodium majus), wild carrot (Daucus carota), wild parsnip (Pastinaca sativa), and water parsnip (Berula spp.). One of the more common misidentifications is between water <b>hemlock</b> and water parsnip; both have clusters of small white flowers shaped like umbrellas, and both have the same habitat near the shore line of lakes and rivers. Differences between water parsnip and water <b>hemlock</b> include the water parsnip having leaves only once compound while the water <b>hemlock</b> has leaves which are {{two or three times}} compound. Water <b>hemlock</b> also has a large swelling at the stem base which water parsnip lacks. Additionally, water <b>hemlock</b> has bracts at the base of each small flower cluster, not {{at the base of the}} main flower head, while water parsnip has both bracts at the base of flowers and also at the main flower head.|$|E

5000|$|At night, by the fire, The {{colors of}} the bushes And of the fallen leaves, Repeating {{themselves}}, Turned in the room, Like the leaves themselves Turning in the wind. Yes: but {{the color of the}} heavy <b>hemlocks</b> Came striding. And I remembered the cry of the peacocks. The {{colors of the}}ir tails Were like the leaves themselves Turning in the wind, In the twilight wind. They swept over the room, Just as they flew from the boughs of the <b>hemlocks</b> Down to the ground. I heard them cryâ€”the peacocks. Was it a cry against the twilight Or against the leaves themselves Turning in the wind, Turning as the flames Turned in the fire, Turning as the tails of the peacocks Turned in the loud fire, Loud as the <b>hemlocks</b> Full of the cry of the peacocks? Or was it a cry against the <b>hemlocks?</b> Out of the window, I saw how the planets gathered Like the leaves themselves Turning in the wind. I saw how the night came, Came striding like the color of the heavy <b>hemlocks</b> I felt afraid. And I remembered the cry of the peacocks. It can be compared to imagist paintings of the period such as Klee's [...] "Blaue Nacht",http://imagesource.art.com/images/-/Paul-Klee/Blaue-Nacht-Print-C10078194.jpeg Klee's shades of blue replaced by Stevens' colors of the night. Stevens adds unsettling elements. The poem unfolds like a little horror show. A fire creates flickering images of the colors of bushes and leaves, which themselves turn in the wind. Also the color of heavy <b>hemlocks</b> [...] "came striding", as from the river Styx ("the Stygian hemlocks", in Vendler's phrase). Ambiguous peacocks descend from the <b>hemlocks.</b> Then the poet notices outside his window the planets gathering isomorphically, [...] "Like the leaves themselves", and the night came striding. The threat of darkness (death? suicide?) is palpable: [...] "I felt afraid." ...|$|R

5|$|Aureoboletus mirabilis, {{commonly}} known as the admirable bolete, the bragger's bolete, and the velvet top, is an edible species of fungus in the Boletaceae mushroom family. The fruit body has several characteristics with which it may be identified: a dark reddish-brown cap; yellow to greenish-yellow pores on the undersurface of the cap; and a reddish-brown stem with long narrow reticulations. Aureoboletus mirabilis is found in coniferous forests along the Pacific Coast of North America, and in Asia. Unusual for boletes, A.mirabilis sometimes appears to fruit on the wood or woody debris of <b>Hemlock,</b> suggesting a saprobic lifestyle. Despite occasional appearances to the contrary, Aureoboletus mirabilis is mycorrhizal, and forms close mutualistic associations with <b>hemlock</b> roots.|$|E

5|$|NY15A {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY15 {{in the town}} of Springwater hamlet of the same name, also officially known as Springwater Hamlet, located {{on the east side of}} a large valley in southeastern Livingston County. The route heads northward as North Main Street, proceeding along the eastern base of the valley as it passes through the northern half of the community. Outside of the hamlet, NY15A enters a rural, undeveloped area dominated by dense forests to the east and a low-lying, slightly more open area to the west. As the route approaches the Livingstonâ€“Ontario county line, the lowlands give way to marshes, which in turn lead to <b>Hemlock</b> Lake at the county line. While in Ontario County {{in the town of}} Canadice, NY15A follows a more inland route to the east, passing through an isolated forest situated between <b>Hemlock</b> and Canadice Lakes.

5|$|The {{climate of}} Adams {{gives it a}} large amount of {{diversity}} within its forests. On the west side, down in the lower valleys, grand fir and Douglas fir dominate the forest with Western <b>hemlock</b> and Western red cedar as well. On the east side, Douglas fir and ponderosa pine are dominant with some patches of dense lodgepole pine. Western <b>hemlock</b> and Western red cedar also occur, but are limited to creek and river bottoms. Grand fir is present on sites with better moisture retention. At middle elevations on the west side, grand fir is increasingly replaced by Pacific silver fir and noble fir; and on the east side, lodgepole becomes much more prevalent. Above a certain elevation, lodgepole pine also appears in areas on the west side as well. As elevation increases further, the forest changes again with subalpine fir, Engelmann spruce, and mountain <b>hemlock</b> becoming the dominant tree species on all sides of the mountain. Eventually, the last trees to disappear from the mountainside are the highly cold tolerant whitebark pine and mountain <b>hemlock.</b> Other conifers, 18 species in all, that play a lesser role than the dominant species are Western white pine, Sitka spruce, Western larch, Pacific yew, Alaska cedar, and mountain juniper. Adams is also home to many hardwoods as well including the tree species big leaf maple, Oregon white oak, quaking aspen, black cottonwood, and red alder. Large shrubs/small trees include the dwarf birch, Suksdorfâ€™s hawthorn, California hazelnut, bitter cherry, vine maple, Douglas maple, and blue elderberry and contribute to a vibrant fall display.|$|E

The Roaring Creek Bluffs are listed on the Columbia County Natural Areas Inventory. Jeweled shooting-star, which is threatened in Pennsylvania, occurs at this site. Other plant species in this area include hydrangea, fragile fern, maidenhair spleenwort, golden saxifrage. However, several weedy plants also grow in the area.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} habitats {{of these}} birds are mature coniferous woodlands, {{the central part}} of their breeding range being in the southeastern portion of Canada's boreal forest.
