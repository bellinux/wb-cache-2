40|$|A {{simplified}} {{model of}} a redundant power grid is used to study integration of fluctuating renewable generation. The grid consists of large number of generator and consumer nodes. The net power consumption {{is determined by the}} difference between the <b>gross</b> <b>consumption</b> and the level of renewable generation. The <b>gross</b> <b>consumption</b> is drawn from a narrow distribution representing the predictability of aggregated loads, and we consider two different distributions representing wind and solar resources. Each generator is connected to D consumers, and redundancy is built in by connecting R ≤ D of these consumers to other generators. The lines are switchable so that at any instance each consumer is connected to a single generator. We explore the capacity of the renewable generation by determining the level of ”firm ” generation capacity that can be displaced for different levels of redundancy R. We also develop message-passing control algorithm for finding switch settings where no generator is overloaded. ...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{monoxide}} (CO) {{plays an}} important role in controlling the oxidizing capacity of the atmosphere by reacting with OH radicals that affect atmospheric methane (CH 4) dynamics. We develop a process-based biogeochemistry model to quantify CO exchange between the soil and the atmosphere at the global scale. The model is parameterized using CO flux data from the field and laboratory experiments for eleven representative ecosystem types. The model is then extrapolated to the global terrestrial ecosystems. Global soil <b>gross</b> <b>consumption,</b> gross production, and net flux of the atmospheric CO are estimated to be 132 – 154, 29 – 36 and 102 – 119  Tg CO yr − 1 (1  Tg =  1012  g), respectively, assuming a constant spatially distributed atmospheric CO concentration (~  128  ppbv) during the 20 th century. When satellite-based atmospheric CO concentration data are used, our estimates of the soil <b>gross</b> <b>consumption</b> are 180 - 197 Tg CO yr- 1 in the period of 2000 – 2013. Tropical evergreen forest, savanna and deciduous forest areas are the largest sinks at 93  Tg CO yr − 1. Soil CO <b>gross</b> <b>consumption</b> is sensitive to air temperature and atmospheric CO concentration while gross production is sensitive to soil organic carbon (SOC) stock and air temperature. Under future climate scenarios, the soil <b>gross</b> <b>consumption,</b> gross production and net flux of CO will increase at 0. 15 – 1. 23, 0. 04 – 0. 3 and 0. 12 – 0. 94  Tg CO yr − 2 during 2014 – 2100, reaching 162 – 194, 36 – 44, and 126 – 150  Tg CO yr − 1 by the end of the 21 st century, respectively. Areas near the equator, Eastern US, Europe and eastern Asia will be the largest sinks due to optimum soil moisture and high temperature. The annual global soil net flux of atmospheric CO is primarily controlled by air temperature, soil temperature, SOC and atmospheric CO concentrations, while its monthly variation mainly determined by air temperature, precipitation, soil temperature and soil moisture.

40|$|The oxygen {{level in}} the deep layers (20 – 40 m) of the Baltic {{entrance}} is modelled {{as a function of}} an oxygen consumption rate constant and climate forcing. The oxygen level is calculated as median values of the observed oxygen concentrations. Climate forcing is expressed by water temperature and consumption period, representing the time during which the water was isolated below the halocline and experienced net respiration. First- and zero-order reaction terms are considered, and it is found that the first-order reaction yields an optimal representation of the natural range of oxygen concentration observations in the area. However, neither model performance nor conclusions are strongly dependent on the choice of reaction order. Using the first-order model, the modelled oxygen level declines exponentially with increasing consumption period, where the averaged rate constant for the oxygen consumption at 5 jC is estimated at 0. 0045 day 1. The consumption rate increases exponentially by a factor of 3 with a 10 jC temperature increase. Climate forcing accounts for 64 % of the total variation in oxygen level and 95 % of its seasonal variation. The <b>gross</b> <b>consumption</b> rate is enhanced by 25 % after the spring and autumn phytoplankton blooms, while it is reduced during winter, when surface-water primary production is light limited. This seasonal variation supports the argument that <b>gross</b> <b>consumption</b> can be limited by the availability of organic matter. The averaged seasonal variation in <b>gross</b> <b>consumption</b> rate is included in the model. In this way, we have accounted for both atmospheric forcing and seasonal variations in the bottom-water oxygen level at the Baltic entrance. The averaged error of the model estimate thus becomes 9 %.

40|$|Abstract: A {{number of}} {{products}} that display positive network effects are used in variable quantities by heterogeneous customers. Examples include corporate operating systems, infrastructure software, web services and networking equipment. In many of these contexts, the magnitude of network effects are influenced by <b>gross</b> <b>consumption,</b> rather than simply by user base. Moreover, the value an individual customer derives on account of these network effects {{may be related to}} the extent of their individual consumption, and therefore, the network effects may be heterogeneous across customers. This paper presents a model of nonlinear pricing in the presence of such network effects, under incomplete information, and with the threat of competitive entry. Both homogeneous and heterogeneous network effects are modeled. Conditions under which a fulfilled-expectations contract exists and is unique are established. While network effects generally raise prices, it is shown that accompanying changes in consumption depend on the nature of the network effects — in some cases, it is optimal for the monopolist to induce no changes in usage across customers, while in others cases, network effects raise the usage of all market participants. Optimal pricing is shown to include quantity discounts that increase with usage, and may also involve a nonlinear two-part tariff. These results highlight the impact of network effects on the standard trade-off between price discrimination and value creation, and have important implications for pricing policy...|$|E

Purpose: During {{the first decade of}} the millennia, the total cost of vitamin D tests has increased significantly within many health care jurisdictions worldwide. Australia reports a 100 -fold increase. Legitimately, concerns regarding the economic effectiveness of this test exist.

Methods: Longitudinal data from two Australian datasets are analysed. The first are data obtained from Medicare Australia, which report pharmaceutical consumption.
