These first measurements demonstrated a slight benefit of friction but also showed the subcritical nature of the observed limit cycle oscillations which is clarified.

40|$|AbstractWithin {{the last}} decade, mainly {{due to the}} {{technological}} advancements, educational institutions have witnessed {{a great deal of}} change. In a constantly evolving environment, all stakeholders have felt a kind of urge to invest in new technologies to provide a better learning/teaching environment for their prospective students and therefore innovation and innovative curricular change has become a fundamental issue in educational institutions. However, while some innovations flourish in some institutions, they simply turn out to be epic fail in some others. This paper argues on the importance of acknowledging the fact that innovative change - especially when it involves technology - is shaped and influenced by contextual factors such as leadership, teachers’ attitudes, institutional policies and context specific norms and values. The current paper firstly aims at focusing on “change” phenomenon and its <b>friction</b> <b>generating</b> nature, and then proposes – and – argues on the relevance of a certain model for the sustainability of classroom innovation...|$|E

40|$|Insects show a large {{variety in}} prey capture strategies, with a {{correspondingly}} large diversity in predatory adaptations. We studied {{a specific type}} of predatory claws, these can for example be found in praying mantis species. The claw is closeable over its entire length and the prey is fixed between the femur (upper arm) and the tibia (lower arm) of the insect leg. The morphology of these predatory claws is diverse. Some species have straight claws covered with spines, while other species have smooth, curved claws. We have studied the mechanics of this femur-tibia type of predatory insect claws, by making a physical model, eventually trying to explain why in some insect species the claws are curved instead of straight. The main results are (1) when comparing curved claws to straight claws, curvature leads to a strong reduction of forces driving the prey away from the pivoting point, thereby reducing the need for <b>friction</b> <b>generating</b> structures. (2) In the curved claw model a position exists where the resulting force on the prey is exactly zero. This is because the normal forces on the femur and tibia are opposed, and in line. At this position the prey is perfectly clamped and not driven out of the claw. This feature does not exist in straight claws. (3) In the curved claw, the prey cannot be placed at a position further than a certain maximum distance from the pivoting point. Near this maximum position, the resulting force on the prey reaches high values because moment arms are near zero. (4) Between the zero position and the maximum position the resulting force is directed toward the pivoting point, which stabilizes prey fixation...|$|E
40|$|Wet {{clutches}} are {{machine components}} using friction to transfer torque and providing interruptible connection between rotating shafts in different automobile applications including automatic transmissions. Like any <b>friction</b> <b>generating</b> machine components, wet clutches {{are susceptible to}} continuous wear and degradation during sliding. This regular deterioration process {{as well as the}} choice of operating conditions, ultimately change the overall system performance during operation due to resultant change in the system parameters. The first part of this thesis summarizes some of the notable studies on the wet clutch tribological performance and clarifies goals of the investigation. Previously, plenty of experimental studies on wet clutches have been reported but still some effects regarding the water contamination problem and the influence of mechanical design factors are not covered thoroughly. The thesis aims to experimentally analyse these two different aspects for improving wet clutch performance regarding frictional characteristics and reliability. These two investigations are focused on wet clutches in automatic transmission applications. For evaluating friction behaviour during a long clutch engagement period, suitable test equipment is designed where standard paper based friction plates and steel separator plates are tested with commercially available ATF. To investigate a clutch operated in a controlled environment is one of main the research objectives. The vital concern while designing the test rig is to monitor the clutch parameters for achieving the desired operating conditions for individual tests. Instead of using a multiple clutch plate configuration, as in real applications, a single friction and reaction plate arrangement is considered to simplify the analyses. An experimental study on wet clutch frictional behaviour under water contaminated lubrication condition reveals the change in the friction level for a water contaminated lubricant. It was shown that the friction level increased for the addition of water in the system. This is not a desirable clutch frictional behaviour for maintaining frictional stability. The increase of friction for added water was influenced by the water amount but not by the water exposure time. The test results also showed a higher change in the separator plate's roughness parameter (Ra) for water contaminated systems compared to an uncontaminated wet clutch. In the second part of this thesis, the influence of the clutch’s output shaft’s stiffness and inertia on the clutch system‘s friction reliability is experimentally evaluated. Test results show that the choice of these design factors can provide different outcome concerning clutch frictional performance and shudder sensitivity. Shudder tendency is seen to be increased for decreased torsion shaft stiffness. High frictional losses and clutch degradation are observed for systems with less inertia.

40|$|Wet {{clutches}} are lubricated {{machine components}} which utilize friction to transfer torque and thus establish connection between shafts rotating at different speeds. They {{are used in}} automatic transmission as shifting device or lockup clutch. As well as cooling the contacting surfaces, the lubrication provides controlled friction, smooth performance and long life. Because of this advantage, wet clutches are applicable for heavy duty vehicles (e. g. construction equipment, tractors) to handle high power. However, like any other tribological system, wet clutch performance is dependent on several factors concerning operating conditions, system design etc. As a <b>friction</b> <b>generating</b> machine component, the degradation of the lubricant and the contacting clutch surfaces are continuous process and the friction behavior also changes consequently with the progression of the system deterioration and that directly influences the clutch performance. So, to investigate the clutch influencing factors and fundamental understanding of the interaction mechanism is of great interest. Though wet clutches were immensely studied earlier to investigate different issues, there was lack of clear understanding and knowledge concerning water contamination problem and the system design parameters. The main aim of this thesis is to experimentally evaluate and explain the impact of water contamination and to verify different system design parameters’ influence on wet clutch tribological performance. The study focused on the wet clutches in automatic transmissions. Initially the thesis reviews {{the state of the}} art in wet clutch research, discusses the motivation for the current research aim and clarifies the goals of the investigation. Later the details of the experimental method and findings are discussed in this thesis. Since evaluating the friction behaviour in desired environment is the key requirement, an automated wet clutch test rig was utilized to carry out the friction test where operating conditions (slip time, oil temperature, contact pressure/load, sliding speed) can be controlled and the output torque, contact temperature etc. can monitored. This suitable test equipment was designed for standard paper based friction plate and steel separator plate lubricated with automatic transmission fluid. Instead of using a multiple clutch plate configuration, as in real applications, a single friction and reaction plate arrangement is considered to simplify the analyses. In the first part of the thesis the effect of water contamination on wet clutch tribological performances is experimentally investigated. The study reveals that both the friction reliability and the friction-velocity relation are influenced by the change in the friction behaviour for a water contaminated lubricant. It is shown that the friction level increased for the addition of water in the system. This is not a desirable clutch frictional behaviour for maintaining frictional stability. The increase of friction for added water is influenced by the water amount but not by the water exposure time. Then the study is continued for longer test to evaluate the ageing of the friction interfaces and the lubricant. Though water does not show any long term effect on water contaminated ATF as it is seen in case of friction interfaces, the short term effect in the surface active additives is observed in the current research. This finding also supported the investigation on the water contaminated friction interface degradation and the effect of water on additive adsorption of the contacting surfaces. It was found that the addition of water in ATF intensifies the mean friction coefficient, but in the long run the loss of friction much faster and high, which can in fact degrade the clutch life faster as well. Two simplified ATF was also analysed along with the commercial fully formulated ATF for investigating the water impact to get a simple and comprehensive overview of the consequence. In the second part of this thesis, the influence of the clutch’s output shaft’s stiffness and inertia on the clutch system‘s friction reliability is experimentally evaluated. Test results show that the change in the clutch frictional behaviour with time and degradation can largely influence by the choice of these design factors. This can provide different outcome concerning clutch frictional performance and shudder sensitivity. Shudder tendency is seen to be increased for decreased torsion shaft stiffness. High frictional losses and clutch degradation are observed for systems with less inertia.

For example, the fact that aerostatic bearings require an air supply means having to use a separate air compressor and connecting hoses. This makes the installation bulky. Aerodynamic and hydrodynamic bearings cannot support loads at zero speed. Both hydrodynamic and hydrostatic bearings may cause contamination to the work-pieces and the work environment because of the use of lubricating fluid. A potential solution to the above-mentioned problems is the new squeeze film air bearing. It works on the rapid squeeze action of an air film to produce separation between two metal surfaces. This has the benefit of being compact with a very simple configuration because it does not require an external pressurized air supply, can support loads at zero speed and is free of contamination. For this research, two squeeze film air journal bearings, made from material of Al 2024 - T 3 and Cu - C 101 with the same geometry, were designed. The bearing is in the shape of a round tube with three fins on the outer surface and the journal, a round rod. When excited at a certain normal mode, the bearing shell flexes with a desirable modal shape for the squeeze film action. The various modes of vibration of Al bearing were obtained from a finite-element model implemented in ANSYS. Two Modes, the 13 th and 23 rd, at the respective frequencies of 16. 320 kHz and 25. 322 kHz, were identified for further investigation by experiments with respect to the squeeze film thickness and its load-carrying capacity. For Cu bearing, the two Modes are also 13 th and 23 rd at the respective frequencies of 12. 184 kHz and 18. 459 kHz. In order to produce dynamic deformation of the bearings at their modes, a single layer piezoelectric actuator was used as a driver. The maximum stroke length and the maximum blocking force of the single layer piezoelectric actuator were determined using manual calculation and ANSYS simulation. In the coupled-field analysis, the single layer piezoelectric actuator was mounted on the outside surface of the bearing shell and loaded with an AC and a DC voltage in order to produce the static and dynamic deformation. For the static analysis, the maximum deformation of Al bearing shell is 0. 124 μm when the actuators are driven at the DC of 75 V. For the dynamic analysis, the actuators are driven at three levels of AC, namely 55, 65 and 75 V with a constant DC offset of 75 V and the driving frequency coincided with the modal frequency of the bearing. The maximum dynamic deformation of Al bearing shell is 3. 22 μm at Mode 13 and 2. 08 μm at Mode 23 when the actuators were driven at the AC of 75 V and the DC of 75 V. Similarly, the FEA simulation was used for analyzing Cu bearing. Furthermore, the dynamic deformation of both Al and Cu bearing at Mode 13 and 23 are validated by experiments. This research developed two theoretical models that explain the existence of a net pressure in a squeeze film for the levitation. The first model uses the ideal gas law as first approximation whilst the second uses the CFX simulation to provide a more exact explanation. In terms of the load-carrying capacity, Mode 13 was identified to be better than Mode 23 for both bearings. However, at Mode 13, Al bearing has a higher load-carrying capacity than Cu bearing. This is due to Al bearing having a higher modal frequency and amplitude. Finally, the coupled-field analysis for fluid solid interaction (FSI) was studied at both Mode 13 and 23 for Al bearing. The findings are that: a) the fluid force in the squeeze film can affect the dynamic deformation of the bearing shell, especially at high oscillation frequency, more at Mode 13 than at Mode 23 due to the relatively high pressure end-leakage in the latter; b) the dynamic deformation of the bearing shell increases with the gap clearance in a logarithmic manner at Mode 13; and c) the micron levels of gap clearance provide a damping effect on the dynamic deformation of the bearing shell at Mode 13 and at Mode 23, though much less dominant.
