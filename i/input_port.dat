25|$|In {{order to}} {{generate}} transmission zeroes in stopbands {{for the purpose}} to improve filter selectivity, a number of supplementary couplings besides the nearest couplings are often made in the filters. They are called cross couplings. These couplings bring to foundation of several wave paths from the <b>input</b> <b>port</b> to the output port. Amplitudes of waves transmitted through different paths may compensate themselves at some separate frequencies while summing at the output port.

500|$|The phase {{properties}} of a 90° hybrid coupler {{can be used}} to great advantage in microwave circuits. [...] For example, in a balanced microwave amplifier the two input stages are fed through a hybrid coupler.

[...] However, since the devices are essentially identical the reflection coefficients from each device are equal. [...] The reflected voltage from the FETs are in phase at the isolated port and are 180° different at the <b>input</b> <b>port.</b> [...] Therefore, all of the reflected power from the FETs goes to the load at the isolated port and no power goes to the <b>input</b> <b>port.</b> [...] This results in a good input match (low VSWR).|$|E

[...] This is the case with high power transmitters where returning power can be high enough to damage the transmitter. [...] An absorption filter may be used to remove transmitter spurious emissions such as harmonics or spurious sidebands. [...] A design that has been in use for some time has slots cut in the walls of the feed waveguide at regular intervals. [...] This design is known as a leaky-wave filter. [...] Each slot is connected to a smaller gauge waveguide which is too small to support propagation of frequencies in the wanted band. [...] Thus those frequencies are unaffected by the filter. [...] Higher frequencies in the unwanted band, however, readily propagate along the side guides which are terminated with a matched load where the power is absorbed. [...] These loads are usually a wedge shaped piece of microwave absorbent material. [...] Another, more compact, design of absorption filter uses resonators with a lossy dielectric.|$|E

40|$|In Proc. of the 2014 Makassar International Conference on Electrical Engineering and Informatics (MICEEI). Published in IEEE Xplorer (Indexed by SCOPUS) This paper {{presents}} an arbitration mechanism to balance bandwidth consumption or data throughputs between packets in a network-on-chip (NoC) with ID-based wormhole cut-through switching method. When data traffic flowing through a network communication link is high, the bandwidth {{space of the}} link, which is comsumed by a message or a data stream, could {{be affected by the}} distance between the source node, from which the message is injected, and the hotspot node. Without considering the number of stream flows from different <b>input</b> <b>ports,</b> a simple arbitration control such as round-robin arbitration cannot balance throughput between the streams. This paper proposes an arbitration control strategy capable of assigning bandwidth or data rate fairly between the data streams. The fair arbitration mechanism is enabled by which the arbiter units detect active requests from <b>input</b> <b>ports</b> and the number of the streams flowing from the <b>input</b> <b>ports</b> of the routers. By using the arbitration mechanism, a stream coming far from a hotspot node, can share bandwidths fairly with other streams nearby the the hotspot node...|$|R

[...] Consequently, the port condition is broken for both the <b>input</b> <b>ports</b> of the original networks since current is still able to flow into the other terminal.
