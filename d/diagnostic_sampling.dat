40|$|Background—A nonsurgical {{means to}} access the normal pericardial space could provide {{opportunities}} for <b>diagnostic</b> <b>sampling</b> and therapeutic interventions. Because there are currently no approved nonsurgical methods to accomplish this, we tested a new approach in large animals. Methods and Results—A catheter system was employed in a percutaneous approach from a femoral vein to pierce the right atrial appendage. Pericardial access was confirmed by placement of a radiopaque guidewire visible under fluoroscopy (6 dogs, 13 pigs). In 7 of the pigs, pericardial tamponade, produced by injection of saline or heparinized blood into the pericardial space through this route, was confirmed by fluoroscopy and hemodynamic evidence. The feasibility and safety of this access route were tested with multiple repetitions in all 19 animals. At {{the end of each}} of the 17 acute experiments, direct inspection after thoracotomy revealed no hemopericardium, laceration, or bleeding on catheter withdrawal. In 24 -hour survival studies performed in 2 of the 6 dogs, the animals exhibited no behavioral signs of discomfort or untoward consequences on recovery from anesthesia. Histology revealed only a small (' 1 -mm) fibrinous plug at the site of puncture. Conclusions—The percutaneous approach via the right atrial appendage provides a rapid, safe route {{to access the}} normal pericardial space for <b>diagnostic</b> <b>sampling</b> and to alleviate high-volume and low-volume (, 200 mL) pericardial effusions. The access route is potentially useful for selective administration of therapeutic agents, growth factors, gene vectors, and cardioactive and vasoactive agents to the heart.

This technique is advantageous over traditional cloning of the diagnostic PCR product itself by: (1) making it visually easy to detect plasmid contamination and thus prevent false positives from the plasmid; (2) develop a positive control when the target organism is at a very low prevalence, so initial detection is not relied on for cloning positive controls (this will ensure the PCR is working correctly prior to <b>diagnostic</b> <b>sampling,</b> reducing false negatives); or (3) for developing a PCR and determining the sensitivity prior to the use of diagnostic samples.

40|$|Anaemias are {{a common}} threat to very low birth weight infants and {{a major problem in}} the {{intensive}} care of preterm infants. Contributing factors include anaemia of prematurity and blood losses. The major cause of anaemia of prematurity is an abrupt increase in oxygen availability after transition from placental to pulmonary oxygenation with a consequent decrease in erythro-poietin (EPO) production. As anaemia develops there is a diminished EPO response to decreased oxygen availability. Additionally there is more rapid destruction of fetal cells. Due to rapid growth between 30 and ^ w e e k s ' gestation there may also be haemodilution [1, 2]. Blood loss may be due to spontaneous perinatal haemorrhage, but the most significant cause of anae-mia in the first weeks of life is <b>diagnostic</b> <b>sampling.</b> The smallest preterm infants requiring the highest level of intensive care may have their total blood volume removed for sampling within the first 28 days of life [3].

40|$|Personalized {{medicine}} {{requires the}} development of a wide array of biomarker diagnostic assays, reflecting individual variations and thus allowing tailored therapeutic interventions. Membrane proteins comprise approximately 30 % of total human proteins; they {{play a key role in}} various physiological functions and pathological conditions, although, currently, only a limited number of membrane proteins are applied as biomarkers. In many normal tissues, cell surface membrane proteins are not easily accessible for <b>diagnostic</b> <b>sampling,</b> and tumor-derived membrane preparations – while serving as potential tumor biomarkers – may not reflect physiological protein expression. In addition to post-translational modifications, which may include glycosylation, phosphorylation and lipid modifications, the trafficking of membrane proteins is also regulated. Moreover, a tight cellular quality control monitors membrane protein maturation, and continuous removal and reinsertion, involving special signaling systems, occurs in many cases. However, cell surface membrane proteins already serve as valuable prognostic and predicative biomarkers, for example, in hematological and immunological diseases, by the determination of the cluster of differentiation markers. In this review, we demonstrate the relevance of cell surface membrane biomarkers in various diseases and call attention to the potential application of red blood cell (erythrocyte) membrane proteins in this regard. Surprisingly, red blood cells express hundreds of membrane proteins, which seem to reflect a general genetic and regulatory background, and may serve as relatively stable and easily accessible personalized membrane biomarkers. Quantitative membrane protein detection in red blood cells by flow cytometry may bring a breakthrough in this regard...|$|E

Material and methodsA single-center retrospective observational study was conducted over the period 2001 – 13. Age, gender, histologic type, location, type of clinical presentation, time interval between symptom onset and histologic diagnosis and presence of specific symptoms were recorded, as were the specialty of the physician initially consulted and of the physician taking the diagnostic sample. ResultsSixty-seven cases of ELHN were diagnosed: 39 male and 28 female patients, with a median age of 68 years. B-cell lymphoma (84 %) was more frequent than plasmacytoma (7 %) or T-cell lymphoma (6 %). Location was mainly palatine tonsil (28 %), nasal fossa and sinus (19 %), nasopharynx (14 %) or parotid (13 %). Revelation often involved a mass (33 %), and only rarely any specific symptoms (9 %). Time interval from symptom onset to diagnosis was short in aggressive lymphoma and longer in low-grade lymphoma (mean 4 and 10 months respectively).

40|$|AbstractSkull-base {{osteomyelitis}} (SBO) occurs {{secondary to}} invasive bacterial and fungal infection. Distinguishing between {{fungal and bacterial}} aetiologies of SBO has significant therapeutic implications. An 18 -year (1990 – 2007) retrospective review of patients with SBO presenting to Westmead Hospital was performed. Epidemiological, clinical, laboratory and radiology data were collated. Twenty-one patients (median age 58 years) with SBO were identified: ten (48 %) had bacterial and 11 (52 %) had fungal SBO. Diabetes mellitus (57 %) and chronic otitis externa (33 %) were the most frequent co-morbidities; immunosuppression was present in five cases (24 %). Cranial nerve deficits occurred in ten (48 %) patients. The commonest pathogens were Pseudomonas aeruginosa (50 % bacterial SBO) and a zygomycete (55 % fungal SBO). Compared to bacterial SBO, fungal SBO was more frequently associated with underlying chronic sinusitis, sinonasal pain, facial/periorbital swelling and nasal stuffiness or discharge {{and the absence of}} purulent ear discharge (all p < 0. 05). Bacterial SBO was more frequently associated with deafness, ear pain or ear discharge (all p < 0. 05).
