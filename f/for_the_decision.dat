After comparing museum specimens, paleoanthropologist Ian Tattersall and physical anthropologist Colin Groves recognized three new subspecies in 1991: the Pale fork-marked lemur (P.f.pallescens), Pariente's fork-marked lemur (P.f.parienti), and the Amber Mountain fork-marked lemur (P.f.electromontis). In 2001, Groves elevated all four subspecies to species status based on noticeable color, size, and body proportion differences between the fragmented populations.

López said that his reasons were personal, and he cited his family, the education of his children and the Mexican economy as motivating factors <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision.</b> He came out of retirement and returned to Detroit {{in time for the}} 1983 season. In February 1983, López became the first player in MLB history to receive a pay cut through salary arbitration. López had earned $285,000 in 1982, asked for $315,000 for 1983 and was awarded $250,000. He finished 1983 with a 98 record, 2.81 ERA and 18 saves.|$|E
5|$|Sitting in Paris, the Tribunal of Arbitration {{finalized}} {{its decision}} on 3 October 1899.

The Schomburgk Line was, with small deviations, re-established as {{the border between}} British Guiana and Venezuela. The first deviation from the Schomburgk line was that Venezuela's territory included Barima Point {{at the mouth of}} the Orinoco, giving it undisputed control of the river, and thus the ability to levy duties on Venezuelan commerce. The second was drawing the border at the Wenamu River rather than the Cuyuni River, giving Venezuela a substantial territory east of the line – territory which Britain had originally refused to include in the arbitration. However, Britain received most of the disputed territory, and all of the gold mines.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports the}} result of the {{empirical}} investigation on the usefulness of company prospectuses <b>for</b> investment <b>decisions.</b> <b>The</b> invesment <b>decisions</b> are measured in terms of initial returns <b>for</b> <b>the</b> investment <b>decision</b> in <b>the</b> primary stock market, and 15 -day mean adjusted returns after Initial public offering <b>for</b> <b>the</b> investment <b>decision</b> in <b>the</b> secondary stock market. The data of the prospectus used are accounting and non-accounting information. Based on the sample of 91 firm-year observations, the result shows that non-accounting information of the prospectus is relevant <b>for</b> <b>the</b> investment <b>decision</b> in <b>the</b> primary stock market. As well, both accounting and non-accounting information is useful <b>for</b> <b>the</b> investment <b>decision</b> in <b>the</b> secondary stock market. Eventhough some ceveats appear in the study and preclude the generalization, the results are robust.

5|$|Kirilenko {{was seen}} as a {{possible}} candidate for the post of First Deputy Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet in 1977, however, First World observers tended to overrate the significance of the office, and because of it, their observation were completely off the mark. Vasili Kuznetsov, a 76-year-old man, was chosen to the office of First Deputy Chairman instead. During Brezhnev's later rule, KGB chairman Yuri Andropov gradually took over the functions and, eventually, Kirilenko's position within the Soviet leadership. In 1979, Kirilenko lost his unofficial office as supervisor of the defence industry over to Pavel Finogenov, a protegé of Dmitriy Ustinov. Kirilenko {{was seen as}} a key candidate by the West to replace Brezhnev as Soviet leader in 1982. After Brezhnev's death, Kirilenko was removed from the ruling Politburo by the new General Secretary Andropov. With his deteriorating health, having a disease known as arteriosclerosis, Kirilenko was disabled from ensuing active politics or protecting himself from Andropov's attacks. After Brezhnev's death and funeral, Kirilenko's mental condition deteriorated to where he could not remember the names of several leading Politburo members. He was unable to write properly during his later life; when asked by Andropov to write a letter of resignation in 1982, he was unable to do so. The decision to remove Kirilenko was taken before Andropov rose to power, so in the event Brezhnev had died later, Kirilenko would still have been forced to resign. The reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision</b> was that Kirilenko's son had tried to defect to the United Kingdom.|$|E
