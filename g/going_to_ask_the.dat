60|$|CONJURER. I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> God whose enemies I {{have served}} if I am still worthy {{to save a}} child.|$|E
6000|$|... "I've got an idea," [...] said Dave, {{as several}} {{children}} approached them. [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> youngsters if they've seen {{a young man}} who looks like me." ...|$|E
60|$|For a {{full minute}} they heard nothing, {{and the others were}} just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> leader what he had heard when there came a shrill laugh from the cedars.|$|E
6000|$|When I had {{sufficiently}} {{thanked her}} and admired it, I said, [...] "What boon are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> from <b>the</b> Virgin, Monica, when you offer her these flowers--safety for your lover in the wars?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>the</b> {{favor of}} {{respecting}} my incognito, Miss Thorn, as Crocker has done," [...] he said. [...] "Crocker knew {{me in the}} East, too. I had not counted upon finding him at Asquith." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't quite know," [...] Dane answered. [...] "I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>the</b> same thing. Carsluith, if Rideau or {{the other}} rascal interferes with us further before I have won {{sufficient}} to float my patent, some of the party won't go home again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's a fact. I {{rang the}} bell, {{and was just}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> maid for 'Persian' when your Aunt Cynthia herself came through the hall and pounced on me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Musha, it's to Mass I'm <b>going,</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Mother of God to give ye many happy Christmases {{the like}} of this, Miss Honora." [...] And Catherine's arms were about her.|$|E
6000|$|George Hatchard {{fell over}} a {{footstool}} with surprise. [...] "Go on," [...] he ses, rubbing his leg. [...] "It's a queer thing, but I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> Morgans 'ere {{to spend the}} evening next Wednesday." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>the</b> same thing, but it don't count," [...] he said. [...] "There's a door yonder, and {{you have}} 'bout ten seconds {{to get out of}} it. If you're here any longer you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take tolerably steep chances of getting hurt." ...|$|R
5000|$|June 9 [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> {{be seeing}} if I can {{challenge}} {{this at the}} Supreme Court level. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>asking</b> <b>the</b> internet providers and all of <b>the</b> phone companies: <b>ask</b> your customers <b>to</b> join me in a class-action lawsuit." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{looked at}} me gravely, as though for {{confirmation}} of his words, and I silently expressed my assent. Leonard de Cartienne was nothing to me; and if his father was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> me <b>the</b> question which I hoped he was, he should have a straightforward answer.|$|R
6000|$|... "But I mean to ask {{the same}} {{question}} that she asked, and you won't put me off with a cock-and-bull story like that." [...] But then, as she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> question, dinner was announced.|$|E
6000|$|Paul Ruttledge. Oh! I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> {{help of the}} Church. But I am to {{be married}} by what may be as old a {{ceremony}} as yours. What is it I am to do, Charlie? ...|$|E
60|$|The dog didn't seem to {{be quite}} 'imself next day, {{and he was so}} fierce in the yard that my missis was afraid to go near 'im. I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> skipper about it, as 'e seemed to know more about dogs than I did, but when I got to the wharf the barge had sailed.|$|E
50|$|In the UK, {{an unseen}} {{examination}} is an essay test {{in school or}} college, where the student {{does not know what}} questions are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>asked.</b> <b>The</b> student is required to answer questions based upon what they have learned over the course of their academic study.|$|R
6000|$|Indeed, {{they were}} a pretty sight, and glistened under the {{sunlight}} like spun silver. [...] "Isn't this tin hollyhock <b>going</b> <b>to</b> seed?" [...] <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Wizard, bending over the flowers.|$|R
5000|$|... "The Schwab" [...] was {{informed}} {{ahead of time}} what topics were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be <b>asked</b> during <b>the</b> [...] "Schwab Showdown" [...] round in each episode. However, {{he did not know}} what the individual questions were.|$|R
60|$|Toby {{could not}} agree exactly with that opinion, neither did he think it wise to disagree, more {{especially}} since he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> very great favor of being discharged; therefore {{he nodded his head}} gravely, and began to stir up what it pleased Mr. Lord to call lemonade, so that the last addition might be more thoroughly mixed with the others.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, he's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> whole gang,"--I hardly felt complimented by the word,--"and {{whatever}} he gives you, he'll give you good. Don't {{look forward to}} variety, but you'll have excellence. And there's another rum thing in his house," [...] proceeded Wemmick, after a moment's pause, as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood; [...] "he never lets a door or window be fastened at night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, we {{must have}} the party," [...] said Aggie, thoughtfully, [...] " [...] and we must make the boys come, if possible. It's no use for {{me to try to}} study now, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> deacon to let me go home. Some of you girls catch Winny Curtis, and find out from him what the boys are going to do. I'll think up some kind of a plan, and after school to-night we'll see what can be done." ...|$|E
60|$|At first I was alarmed, for an Express lunatic and no {{communication}} with the guard, is a serious position. The thought came to my relief that the gentleman might be what is popularly called a Rapper: one of a sect for (some of) whom I have the highest respect, but whom I don't believe in. I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him <b>the</b> question, {{when he took the}} bread out of my mouth.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, it hasn't," [...] said Kate, {{with some}} warmth. [...] "It's turned out first-rate. I think that {{interest}} idea is all stuff. As {{if we wanted}} to set up Aunt Matilda with an income that would last forever! Here comes father. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him about <b>the</b> gun." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Just <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> for <b>the</b> same information,' said Mr. Neigh, {{determining}} the very longest hair in his beard to an infinitesimal nicety by drawing its lower portion through his fingers. 'I have quite forgotten--cannot keep people's names {{in my head}} at all; nor could my father either--nor any of my family--a very odd thing. But my old friend Mrs. Napper knows for certain.' And he turned to one {{of a small group}} of middle-aged persons near, who, instead of skimming the surface of things in general, like the rest of the company, were going into the very depths of them.|$|R
6000|$|I had {{a lovely}} harangue all pat in my head, {{in much the}} same strain, on the {{infinite}} possibilities of entertaining angels unawares, in cabs, on the Underground, in the aÃ«rated bread shops; but Elsie's widening eyes of horror pulled me up short like a hansom in Piccadilly when the inexorable upturned hand of the policeman checks it. 'Oh, Brownie,' she cried, drawing back, 'you don't mean to tell me you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> first young man you meet in an omnibus to marry you?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Very well, I will. Firstly, Arnold Baxter is in jail. Secondly, {{he states}} {{his friends are}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> {{governor}} for a pardon. Thirdly, a friend in disguise comes to the jail with the supposed pardon. Fourthly, great joy of Baxter. Fifthly, he thanks his jailers and bids them good-by, as I said before. Sixthly, after he and his friend are gone the jailers inspect the so-called pardon. Seventhly, the jailers telephone to the governor. Eighthly, the pardon is pronounced a forgery, signatures, seal, and all. Ninthly, all {{the powers that be}} are as mad as hornets, but they can do nothing, for Baxter the elder has gone and has left no trace behind him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{your advice}} and opinion. I {{do not know}} what to do. This acting scheme gets worse and worse, you see. They have chosen almost as bad a play as they could, and now, to {{complete}} the business, are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> help of a young man very slightly known to any of us. This is the end of all the privacy and propriety which was talked about at first. I know no harm of Charles Maddox; but the excessive intimacy which must spring from his being admitted among us in this manner is highly objectionable, the more than intimacy--the familiarity. I cannot think of it with any patience; and it does appear to me an evil of such magnitude as must, if possible, be prevented. Do not you see it in the same light?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Peter." [...] "Well, Daly," [...] {{were the}} greetings, {{as the two}} men met; and then they rode on {{together}} in silence for a mile. [...] "Have you heard what the boys are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do?" [...] <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> master. Peter shook his head. [...] "I suppose there's nothing in it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shucks, he needn't worry a morsel over that. Seth'll {{quiet down}} {{as soon as}} he finds he can't run the Master. He's a rare good teacher--better'n Mr. West was even, and that's saying something. The {{trustees}} are hoping he'll stay for another term. They're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> him at <b>the</b> school meeting to-morrow, and offer him a raise of supplement." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It is {{different}} with you. But a man, {{let him be}} who he may, should live within certain means. As for your sister, I think she will break my heart." [...] Silverbridge {{found it to be}} quite impossible to say anything in answer to this. [...] "Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> church?" [...] <b>asked</b> <b>the</b> Duke.|$|R
6000|$|Early in {{the winter}} the general had called at the Orangery. [...] "We {{are going to make}} a call upon the patriotism of the {{planters}} of this neighborhood, Mrs. Wingfield," [...] he said, during lunch time. [...] "You see our armies are facing those of the Federals opposite Washington, and can offer a firm front to any foe marching down from the North; but unfortunately they have command of the sea, and there is nothing to prevent their embarking an army on board ship and landing it in either the James or the York rivers, and in that case they might make a rush upon Richmond before there would be time to bring down troops to our aid. I am therefore proposing to erect a chain of works between the two rivers, so as {{to be able to keep}} even a large army at bay until re-enforcements arrive; but to do this a large number of hands will be required, and we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> proprietors of plantations to place as many negroes as they can spare at our disposal." ...|$|E
60|$|The letter, {{which had}} {{overcome}} the tacit misgivings {{of his mother}} as they read it and read it again together, was from a girl who had perhaps no need to confess herself young, or to own her inexperience {{of the world where}} stories were written and printed. She excused herself with a delicacy which Verrian's correspondents by no means always showed for intruding upon him, and then pleaded the power his story had over her as the only shadow of right she had in addressing him. Its fascination, she said, had begun with the first number, the first chapter, almost the first paragraph. It was not for the plot that she cared; she had read too many stories to care for the plot; it was the problem involved. It was one which she had so often pondered in her own mind that she felt, in a way she hoped he would not think conceited, almost as if the story was written for her. She {{had never been able to}} solve the problem; how he would solve it she did not see how she could wait to know; and here she made him a confidence without which, she said, she should not have the courage to go on. She was an invalid, and her doctor had told her that, though she might live for months, there were chances that she might die at any moment suddenly. He would think it strange, and it was strange that she should tell him this, and stranger still that she should dare to ask him what she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask.</b> <b>The</b> story had yet four months to run, and she had begun to have a morbid foreboding that she should not live to read it in the ordinary course. She was so ignorant about writers that she did not know whether such a thing was ever done, or could be done; but if he could tell her how the story was to come out he would be doing more for her than anything else that could be done for her on earth. She had read that sometimes authors began to print their serial stories before they had written them to the end, and he might not be sure of the end himself; but if he had finished this story of his, and could let her see the last pages in print, she would owe him the gratitude she could never express.|$|E
5000|$|When the {{contract}} with CBS ends 1993, no network {{is ever going to}} pay that much money again. The owners, who threw away all the television money, most on bad ballplayers, in the first 15 minutes after the checks cleared, are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> players for a giveback. And the players, who have every reason to believe the owners are rich idiots, are going to laugh at them. New York Times sports columnist George Vecsey in October 1991 ...|$|E
50|$|The {{initial period}} was tough with many sceptics. Tan started by <b>going</b> {{door-to-door}} <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> biggest taxi fleet companies {{to try his}} product. Only the fifth taxi company he approached, operating a small fleet of 30, gave him a chance. The company progressed and raised US$90 million in 12 months from hedge fund Tiger Global, prominent Chinese venture capital firm GGV Capital, Vertex Venture Holdings (subsidiary of Singapore sovereign wealth fund Temasek Holdings), and more. In May 2014, GrabTaxi said it had 1.2 million downloads. At around June 2013, it claimed to be doing one booking every eight seconds, or 10,000 a day, a sixteen-fold growth within a year.|$|R
6000|$|... "You needn't {{imply that}} I {{like it to}} be in the dark. I would like to walk with you in broad day past all the houses in Leatherwood. But I don't suppose you'd let me." [...] She did not say anything, and he added, [...] "I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first chance." [...] Still she did not say anything, though her father had fallen behind and left the talk wholly to them.|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this piece}} I {{would like to}} tell a few stories; three stories to be precise. Firstly I want to explain where I am, where I've come from and what has led me to the views that I hold today. I find myself at an {{interesting}} point in my life and career at the same point as the research community is undergoing massive change. The second story is one of what the world might look like {{at some point in the}} future. What might we achieve? What might it look like? And what will be possible? Finally I want <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> <b>the</b> question of how we get there from here. What is the unifying idea or movement that actually has the potential to carry us forward in a positive way? At the end of this I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>ask</b> you, <b>the</b> reader, <b>to</b> commit to something as part of the process of making that happen. </p...|$|R
