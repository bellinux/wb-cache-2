25|$|The {{process of}} {{measurement}} goes as follows. First, {{a sample of}} the substance is cooled to absolute zero. At this temperature, the entropy is zero by definition. Then, small amounts of heat are introduced into the sample and the change in temperature is recorded, until the temperature reaches a desired value (usually 25°C). The obtained data allows to integrate the equation above, yielding the absolute value of entropy of the substance at the <b>final</b> <b>temperature.</b> This value of entropy is called calorimetric entropy.|$|E
25|$|In {{classical}} thermodynamics, {{a commonly}} considered {{model is the}} heat engine. It consists of four bodies: the working body, the hot reservoir, the cold reservoir, and the work reservoir. A cyclic process leaves the working body in an unchanged state, and is envisaged as being repeated indefinitely often. Work transfers between the working body and the work reservoir are envisaged as reversible, and thus only one work reservoir is needed. But two thermal reservoirs are needed, because transfer of energy as heat is irreversible. A single cycle sees energy taken by the working body from the hot reservoir {{and sent to the}} two other reservoirs, the work reservoir and the cold reservoir. The hot reservoir always and only supplies energy and the cold reservoir always and only receives energy. The second law of thermodynamics requires that no cycle can occur in which no energy is received by the cold reservoir. Heat engines achieve higher efficiency when the difference between initial and <b>final</b> <b>temperature</b> is greater.|$|E

40|$|We {{revisit the}} classic {{thermodynamic}} problem of maximum work extraction from two arbitrary sized {{hot and cold}} reservoirs, modelled as perfect gases. Assuming ignorance {{about the extent to}} which the process has advanced, which implies an ignorance about the <b>final</b> <b>temperatures,</b> we quantify the prior information about the process and assign a prior distribution to the unknown temperature(s). This requires that we also take into account the temperature values which are regarded to be unphysical in the standard theory, as they lead to a contradiction with the physical laws. Instead in our formulation, such values appear to be consistent with the given prior information and hence are included in the inference. We derive estimates of the efficiency at optimal work from the expected values of the <b>final</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and show that these values match with the exact expressions in the limit when any one of the reservoirs is very large compared to the other. For other relative sizes of the reservoirs, we suggest a weighting procedure over the estimates from two valid inference procedures, that generalizes the procedure suggested earlier in [J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. 46, 365002 (2013) ]. Thus a mean estimate for efficiency is obtained which agrees with the optimal performance to a high accuracy. Comment: 14 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

The endo/exothermicity of pyrolysis reactions were estimated and the results verified later by thermal analysis using a Calvet isothermal calorimeter. The pyrolysis retort set-up was classical (with possibilities of recovery of all effluents generated) and used electrical resistors to provide the heat for carbonizing the wood. The electrical energy utilized during a complete cycle of carbonization was measured by a watt-hour meter to estimate the SSE. The carbonization process parameters (i. e. initial wood moisture, <b>final</b> <b>temperatures,</b> residence time at <b>final</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and heating rates employed) were varied and chosen to approach field carbonization conditions as would be encountered on an industrial scale.
