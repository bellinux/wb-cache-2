25|$|Leff (1982, 1997) {{explains}} the decline {{experiences in the}} north-east in terms of Dutch disease. As coffee exports came to play {{a greater role in}} the foreign exchange market, the real exchange rate increasingly reflected the importance of that product, which had a negative impact on the less competitive regions, such as the north-east. It was neither possible to restructure the sugar industry very quickly, nor easy to promote large-scale inter-regional migration flows, although a large number of slaves did move from the north-east to the south-east. Throughout this period, the expansion of the coffee industry was not hindered by any increase in labor costs, since up to 1852(end of the slave trade), wages were depressed by the presence of slave labor and later by subsidized immigration flows, particularly from Italy (Leff 1997:5). This strengthened the existing pattern in Brazil: an export sector that generated high levels of earnings alongside a large sector that catered to the domestic market and a large subsistence economy, both with very low levels of productivity, with the outcome being low per capita income levels but a high <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> relative to the other Latin American economies.|$|E

The existing <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> approach is attractive due to minimum data requirements; however, this method does not account for hydrologic variability. In this paper, an erosion-scaled <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> approach is proposed that can model and explain the hydrologic variability in predicting the annual phosphorus (P) loading to the receiving stream. Here sediment discharge was introduced into the <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> model as a surrogate for hydrologic variability. Application of this approach to model P in the Fishtrap Creek of Washington State showed the superiority of this approach compared to the traditional <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> approach, while maintaining its simplicity and low data requirement characteristics. In addition, a Bayesian framework is proposed to assess the parameter uncertainty of the <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> method instead of subjective assignment of uncertainty. This work also showed through a joint variability-uncertainty analysis the importance of separate consideration of hydrologic variability and parameter uncertainty, as these represent two independent and important characteristics of the overall model uncertainty. The paper also recommends the use of a longitudinal data collection scheme to reduce the uncertainty in export coefficients...|$|E

40|$|The use of {{nutrient}} <b>export</b> <b>coefficients</b> {{provides a}} convenient means to estimate diffuse export of nutrients from catchments to lakes. Within individual catchments {{it is common}} to calibrate measured nutrients in surface waters with coefficients of intensity of land use, but the estimation of nutrient loads from one catchment based on <b>export</b> <b>coefficients</b> from another, albeit similar one, can be problematic. In the Lough Carra catchment in the west of Ireland, use of seemingly reasonable <b>export</b> <b>coefficients,</b> led to the estimation of about three times the measured load of phosphorus to the lake. This discrepancy is likely caused by low drainage density, high chemical buffering capacity of podzolic soils of the catchment and low historical intensification of the catchment relative to many other Irish grasslands. Nevertheless, profiles of lake sediment indicate progressive eutrophication of the lake, with associated reductions in Fe:P ratios indicative of impact from diffuse P loads. Lough Carra {{is one of the few}} remaining calcareous lakes in Europe managed to protect populations of wild trout (Salmo trutta). There is a high risk that continuation of current landuse in the catchment of the lake is an ecological time-bomb that will effect undesirable and persistent changes...|$|R
40|$|A manageable, {{relatively}} inexpensive model was constructed {{to predict the}} loss of nitrogen and phosphorus from a complex catchment to its drainage system. The model used an <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> approach, calculating the total nitrogen (N) and total phosphorus (P) load delivered annually to a water body as {{the sum of the}} individual loads exported from each nutrient source in its catchment. The <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> modelling approach permits scaling up from plot-scale experiments to the catchment scale, allowing application of findings from field experimental studies at a suitable scale for catchment management. The catchment of the River Windrush, a tributary of the River Thames, UK, was selected as the initial study site. The Windrush model predicted nitrogen and phosphorus loading within 2 % of observed total nitrogen load and 0. 5 % of observed total phosphorus load in 1989. The <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> modelling approach was then validated by application in a second research basin, the catchment of Slapton Ley, south Devon, which has markedly different catchment hydrology and land use. The Slapton model was calibrated within 2 % of observed total nitrogen load and 2. 5 % of observed total phosphorus load in 1986. Both models proved sensitive to the impact of temporal changes in land use and management on water quality in both catchments, and were therefore used to evaluate the potential impact of proposed pollution control strategies on the nutrient loading delivered to the River Windrush and Slapton Le...|$|E

The model predicted an annual TP load of 25605 kg yr− 1, compared with an observed (measured) value of 23400 kg yr− 1 Monthly loads calculated using the <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> model agreed well with monthly observed values except in months of variable discharge, when observed values were low, probably due to infrequent, and therefore unrepresentative, sampling. Comparison between filterable reactive phosphorus (FRP) and TP concentrations observed in the period 1990 – 1997 showed that trends in FRP could be estimated from trends in TP. A sensitivity analysis (varying individual export coefficients by ± 10 %) showed that sewage treatment works (STWs) (3. 5 %), tilled land (2. 7 %), meadow–verge–seminatural (1. 0 %), and mown and grazed turf (0. 6 %) had the most significant effect (percent difference from base contribution) on model prediction. The model was also used to estimate the effect of phosphorus stripping at STWs in order to comply with a pending change in the European Union wastewater directive. Theoretical reduction of TP from the largest STW in the catchment gave a predicted reduction in TP loading of 2174 kg yr− 1 This illustrates the value of this seasonal <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> model as a practical management tool...|$|E

Nutrient export coefficients are the amounts of nitrogen or phosphorus exported from an area over a specific time period and are generally applied to a specific land use.

40|$|This study {{examined}} nonpoint source pollution via tributaries to Pineview Reservoir. Since few literature values of <b>export</b> <b>coefficients</b> {{are available for}} snowfall-dominated watersheds such as Pineview, locally scaled rates were quantified using an upstream-downstream bracketing technique. Nitrogen and phosphorus grab samples were manually collected and discharge measurements were conducted during the annual study period. Additionally, high-frequency monitoring sensors that measured EC, temperature, turbidity, and water level were deployed at the up- and downstream sites to represent short-duration transport events and to examine watershed processes on a more representative time scale. Daily nutrient loads were estimated from grab samples and flow rates using the Rank- Data (RD) distribution method and, using surrogate relationships for discharge and total phosphorus (TP) concentration from high-frequency sensors, half-hour TP loads were calculated. Short-duration snow melt events were identified by turbidity spikes and increased air temperatures as well as, in some cases, hydrograph peaks. During these events, <b>export</b> <b>coefficients</b> from 0. 31 to 0. 54 g TP/ha/hr were observed for low and high elevation snow melt events. While losses to ground water were observed for one study reach, the study reach with positive load gains had annual <b>export</b> <b>coefficients</b> of 0. 018 g TP/ha/hr from high-frequency loads and 7. 5 e- 5 g NOx-N/ha/hr, 3. 5 e- 6 g SRP/ha/hr, and 9. 1 e- 6 g TP/ha/hr from RD loads. These rates were 1, 000 to 2, 000 times greater than available literature values typical of rainfall-dominated watersheds.

The model was developed to provide reasonable estimates across the whole of Europe based on readily accessible datasets, and that would be amenable to application within a gridded model of water quality loadings to surface waters. The <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> models for biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), total nitrogen (TN) and total phosphors (TP) were fitted to data from European Union European Environment Agency databases of 79 – 106 selected river basins around Europe depending on the variable in question. Estimated export coefficients were on a reasonable level with estimates made by other methods within Europe. Firstly, it was shown that runoff, number of livestock and point load were common factors for BOD, TP and TN loads with runoff as the most important factor. Secondly, cropland area also contributed to diffuse TN load. Thirdly, average slope steepness and runoff, as a combined factor, had a negative effect on diffuse TP load. Fourthly, lake area reduced diffuse loads because of retention mechanisms in lakes. A larger set of data with higher spatial and temporal resolution and partitioning of the data based on, e. g. climate or spatial patterns would further improve the precision of the <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> estimates. When applied at the catchment scale, the parameters should be updated with local data. In the long run, adaptive modelling should be applied in order to fit the model to continuously accumulating data and experience, although the study showed that the export coefficients derived were stable over time.

The model was originally developed for the Windrush catchment where the highly reactive Jurassic limestone aquifer underlying the catchment is well connected to the surface drainage network, allowing the system to be modelled using uniform export coefficients for each nutrient source in the catchment, regardless of proximity to the surface drainage network. In the Slapton catchment, the hydrological pathways are dominated by surface and lateral shallow subsurface flow, requiring modification of the <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> model to incorporate a distance–decay component in the export coefficients.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the development of}} an <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> model to characterise the rates and sources of P export from land to water in four reservoir systems located in a semi-arid rural region in southern of Portugal. The model was developed to enable effective management of these important water resource systems under the EU Water Framework Directive. This is the first time such an approach has been fully adapted for the semi-arid systems typical of Mediterranean Europe. The sources of P loading delivered to each reservoir from its catchment were determined and scenario analysis was undertaken to predict the likely impact of catchment management strategies on the scale of rate of P loading delivered to each water body from its catchment. The results indicate the importance of farming and sewage treatment works/collective septic tanks discharges as the main contributors to the total diffuse and point source P loading delivered to the reservoirs, respectively. A reduction in the total P loading for all study areas would require control of farming practices and more efficient removal of P from human wastes prior to discharge to surface waters. The scenario analysis indicates a strategy based solely on reducing the agricultural P surplus may result in only a slow improvement in water quality, which would be unlikely to support the generation of good ecological status in reservoirs. The model application indicates that a reduction of P-inputs to the reservoirs should first focus on reducing P loading from sewage effluent discharges through the introduction of tertiary treatment (P-stripping) in all major residential areas. The fully calibrated <b>export</b> <b>coefficient</b> modelling approach transferred well to semi-arid regions, with the only significant limitation being the availability of suitable input data to drive the model. Further studies using this approach in semi-arid catchments are now needed to increase the knowledge of nutrient export behaviours in semi-arid regions...|$|E

Estimates of the relative contribution of phosphorus from various sources enabled the selection of possible reduction strategies on a site specific basis. The effect of reduction strategies on trophic status was predicted with the aid of the model. It was established that diffuse agricultural losses of phosphorus are the most common source of enrichment. However, consented discharges of sewage efHuent appear to affect a significant number of sites. Phosphorus in urban runoff is a notable source for lakes situated in less rural areas. Agricultural point sources significantly influence a small number of lakes. A critique of the methodology concluded that the use of separate <b>export</b> <b>coefficients</b> for organic and inorganic sources may be useful for identifying appropriate management strategies, but that the scientific basis for such an approach is dubious. In addition, the employment of agricultural returns for data on livestock levels may introduce an unacceptable degree of error into the calculations.

These coefficients were used to estimate the annual P load at each monitoring site, and also the relative contribution of point source (from sewage treatment works (STW)) and diffuse input (from both livestock and agricultural land use). The estimated annual P loads showed very close agreement (r 2 = 0. 98) with the measured total phosphorus (TP) loads. Sites with the highest proportion of P derived from STW had the highest TP concentrations and loads, and also had greater variations between seasons, with elevated P concentrations occurring during the summer months. The GIS model was re-run to determine the effect of an 80...|$|R
40|$|The {{amendments}} to the Forest Law proposed by the Brazilian government that allow partial substitution of forested areas by agricultural activities raised deep concern about the integrity of aquatic ecosystems. To assess the impacts of this alteration in land uses on the watershed, diffuse loads of total nitrogen (Nt) and total phosphorus (Pt) were estimated in Lobo Stream watershed, southeastern Brazil, based on <b>export</b> <b>coefficients</b> of the Model of Correlation between Land Use and Water Quality (MQUAL). Three scenarios were generated: scenario 1 (present scenario), with 30 -meter-wide permanent preservation areas along the shore of water bodies and 50 -meter-radius in springs; scenario 2, conservative, with 100 -meter-wide permanent preservation areas along water bodies; and scenario 3, with the substitution of 20 % of natural forest by agricultural activities. Results indicate that a suppression of 20 % of forest cover would cause an increase in nutrient loads {{as well as in}} the trophic state of aquatic ecosystems of the watershed. This could result in losses of ecosystem services and compromise the quality of water and its supply for the basin. This study underlines the importance of forest cover for the maintenance of water quality in Lobo Stream watershed...|$|R
