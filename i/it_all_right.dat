500|$|Julian Glover as (Lieutenant) Colonel Breen: Roy Ward Baker {{first met}} Glover when he {{directed}} {{him in an}} episode of The Avengers ("Two's a Crowd", 1965). Baker said of Glover's performance, “He turned in a tremendous character, forceful, autocratic but never over the top.” Glover recalled of the role, “I think I was too young for it. [...] I think I played <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>right.</b> It was very straightforward. Bit of a stereotype. [...] The obligatory asshole!” ...|$|E
500|$|On May 29, Conley {{was interviewed}} for four hours. His new {{affidavit}} said that Frank told him, [...] "he {{had picked up}} a girl back there and let her fall and that her head hit against something." [...] Conley said he and Frank took the body to the basement via the elevator, then returned to Frank's office where the murder notes were dictated. Conley then hid in the wardrobe after the two {{had returned to the}} office. He said Frank gave him $200, but took it back, saying, [...] "Let me have that and I will make <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> with you Monday if I live and nothing happens." [...] Conley's affidavit concluded, [...] "The reason I have not told this before is I thought Mr. Frank would get out and help me out and I decided to tell the whole truth about this matter." [...] At trial, Conley changed his story concerning the $200. He said Frank decided to withhold the money until Conley had burned Phagan's body in the basement furnace.|$|E

2500|$|The first {{historical}} {{reference to}} Yang Meng was in 919, when Yang Longan had just declared himself the King of Wu, a kingdom {{derived from the}} domains that Yang Xingmi conquered {{at the end of}} Tang. [...] Yang Longyan created his younger brothers and his only known son Yang Fen (楊玢) dukes — in Yang Meng's case, the Duke of Lujiang. [...] It was said that Yang Meng was talented, and he often lamented the state of the affairs in Wu, which then was in effect controlled by the regent Xu Wen, stating, [...] "It is the state of my family's; is <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> for it to be taken over by others?" [...] Xu heard of his remarks and was displeased at them. [...] Shortly after, Xu had him sent out of the capital Guangling to serve as the military prefect (團練使, Tuanlianshi) of Chu Prefecture (楚州, in modern Huai'an, Jiangsu).|$|E
2500|$|Young said he {{traveled}} to Seattle to record the record for a [...] "challenge." [...] He said, [...] "Recording Mirror Ball was like audio vérité, just a snapshot of what's happening. Sometimes I didn't know who was playing. I was just conscious of this big smouldering mass of sound." [...] Young called Pearl Jam drummer Jack Irons [...] "unbelievable." [...] He stated that he [...] "played his ass off on every take at every session," [...] and added, [...] "I can't say enough good things about him." [...] Pearl Jam vocalist Eddie Vedder was not around much for the recording sessions. Vedder {{explained that he was}} [...] "in the midst of a pretty intense stalker problem," [...] adding that [...] "leaving the house wasn't the easiest thing to do." [...] Vedder would refer to the issue in the song [...] "Lukin" [...] from Pearl Jam's 1996 album, No Code. Pearl Jam guitarist Stone Gossard said that Mirror Ball [...] "came {{at a time when we}} needed it, that Neil thought we were a band that would be good to make a record with. He probably felt sorry for us. He made <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>right</b> for us to be who we were. He's not taking his career so seriously that he can't take chances. Suddenly, our band seemed too serious." ...|$|E
