5|$|The RIRA's {{objective}} is a united Ireland by forcing {{the end of}} British sovereignty over Northern Ireland {{through the use of}} physical force. The organisation rejects the Mitchell Principles and the <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>Agreement,</b> comparing the latter to the 1921 Anglo-Irish Treaty which resulted in the partition of Ireland. The organisation aims to uphold an uncompromising form of Irish republicanism and opposes any political settlement that falls short of Irish unity and independence.|$|E
5|$|Although {{there have}} been {{permanent}} garrisons in Northern Ireland throughout its history, the British Army was deployed as a peacekeeping force from 1969 to 2007 in Operation Banner. Initially, this was (in the wake of unionist attacks on nationalist communities in Derry and Belfast) to prevent further loyalist attacks on Catholic communities; it developed into support of the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) and its successor, the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI) against the Provisional Irish Republican Army (PIRA). Under the 1998 <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>Agreement,</b> there was a gradual {{reduction in the number}} of soldiers deployed. In 2005, after the PIRA declared a ceasefire, the British Army dismantled posts, withdrew many troops and restored troop levels to those of a peace-time garrison.|$|E
25|$|Attempts {{to secure}} its {{operation}} {{on a permanent}} basis had been frustrated by disagreements between the two main unionist parties (the Democratic Unionist Party and the Ulster Unionist Party) and Sinn Féin, the largest nationalist party. Unionists refused {{to participate in the}} <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>Agreement's</b> institutions alongside Sinn Féin until they were assured that the IRA had discontinued its activities, decommissioned its arms and disbanded.|$|R
50|$|Mitchell was {{reportedly}} among those considered by Al Gore as {{a running mate}} for his 2000 presidential run. Gore, however, ultimately selected Joe Lieberman. Had Mitchell been nominated and the Democratic ticket won that year, {{he would have been}} the first Arab American to serve as the Vice President of the United States and just the second Vice President from Maine after Hannibal Hamlin. He also was mentioned in both 2000 and in 2004 as a potential Secretary of State for a Democratic administration, due to his role as Senate Leader and the <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>agreements.</b>|$|R

5|$|In {{the months}} {{following}} Labour's 1997 election victory, referendums {{were held in}} Scotland and Wales regarding devolution. There was a clear majority supporting devolution in Scotland and a narrower majority in Wales; Scotland received a stronger degree of devolution than Wales. The Labour government passed laws in 1998 to establish a Scottish Parliament and Welsh Assembly, the first elections for these were held in 1999. Blair attempted to continue peace negotiations in Northern Ireland by offering {{the creation of a}} regional parliament and government. In 1998, the <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>Agreement</b> was made, which allowed for a 108-member elected assembly and a power-sharing arrangement between nationalists and unionists. Blair was personally involved in these negotiations.|$|E
5|$|Other groups, on {{both the}} unionist side and the {{nationalist}} side, participated in violence and a period known as the Troubles began. Over 3,600 deaths resulted over the subsequent three decades of conflict. Owing to the civil unrest during the Troubles, the British government suspended home rule in 1972 and imposed direct rule. There were several unsuccessful attempts to end the Troubles politically, such as the Sunningdale Agreement of 1973. In 1998, following a ceasefire by the Provisional IRA and multi-party talks, the <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>Agreement</b> was concluded as a treaty between the British and Irish governments, annexing the text agreed in the multi-party talks.|$|E
5|$|On 7 March 2009 the RIRA claimed {{responsibility}} for the 2009 Massereene Barracks shooting. This shooting occurred outside the Massereene Barracks as four soldiers were receiving a pizza delivery. Two soldiers were killed, and the other two soldiers and two deliverymen were injured. On 3 April 2009 the RIRA in Derry {{claimed responsibility}} for carrying out a punishment shooting {{of a man who was}} awaiting sentencing for raping a 15-year-old girl. The RIRA were also blamed for orchestrating rioting in the Ardoyne area of Belfast on 13 July 2009 as an Apprentice Boys parade was passing. Several PSNI officers were injured in the rioting and at least one shot was fired at police. In early November, the Independent Monitoring Commission released a report stating that the threat from the RIRA and other dissident republicans was at its most serious level since the 1998 <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>Agreement.</b>|$|E

In March 2005, the Irish-language TV service TG4 began broadcasting from the Divis transmitter near Belfast, as a result of an agreement between the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Northern Ireland Office, although so far this is the only transmitter to carry it.|$|R
2500|$|Mowlam's time as Northern Ireland Secretary saw {{the signing}} of the {{historic}} <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> in 1998.

Mitchell {{that led to the}} <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>Agreement</b> of 1998, but withdrew in protest when Sinn Féin, an Irish republican party with links to the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), was allowed to participate while the IRA kept its weapons. The DUP opposed the Agreement in the <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>Agreement</b> referendum, in which the Agreement was approved with 71.1% of the electorate in favour.|$|E
50|$|The Northern Ireland {{peace process}} is often {{considered}} to cover the {{events leading up to}} the 1994 Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA) ceasefire, the end of most of the violence of the Troubles, the <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> (or Belfast) <b>Agreement</b> of 1998, and subsequent political developments.|$|R

50|$|Following the <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> of 1998 he was {{appointed}} by then Secretary of State for Northern Ireland Rt Hon Mo Mowlam MP, as an Equality Commissioner for Northern Ireland (1999-2002). The Equality Commission for Northern Ireland {{was born out of}} the 'Good Friday’ peace agreement and was charged with dealing with equalities issues between Catholics & Protestants, Unionists & Nationalists, and discrimination by race, gender, disability, sexuality and age. Malik served as the only ever person from England, Scotland or Wales (Great Britain) to have been appointed a Commissioner in Northern Ireland.|$|R
25|$|The Irish Government {{was bound}} {{by the terms of}} the 1998 <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> (Belfast) <b>Agreement</b> to submit Articles 2 and 3 to {{amendment}} by referendum. To this end, the Nineteenth Amendment of the Constitution was adopted in June of the same year by 94% of those voting. The new wording describes the Irish nation as a community of individuals with a common identity rather than as a territory, and is intended to reassure unionists that a united Ireland will not come about without a majority of the Northern Ireland electorate declaring in favour of such a move.|$|R

25|$|In the leadup to {{the signing}} of the <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>Agreement,</b> Allmand was an active {{participant}} in the negotiations via the Coalition for Peace in Ireland. During the negotiations, Allmand met his second wife, Rosemary Nolan, whom he married in 2002.|$|E
25|$|Some {{criticisms of}} the {{amendment}} related merely to {{the manner in which}} it was proposed. Some argued that the amendment had been rushed through without proper debate and consultation. Because the constitutional right to citizenship had been introduced as part of the <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>Agreement</b> it was argued that there should have been consultation with Northern Ireland political parties. In the lead-up to the referendum the Irish and British governments issued a joint statement saying that they did not regard the proposed constitutional change as affecting the British-Irish Agreement (this being the inter-governmental component of the <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> <b>Agreement).</b> The Democratic Unionist Party cited the amendment as evidence that the Agreement could be changed.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{employs the}} {{hypothesis}} {{that one of the}} functions of political discourse is to legitimise a perceived point of view by promoting certain representations of a socio-political reality. It could be argued that the 1998 <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> (Belfast) <b>Agreement</b> creates a paradoxical reality in Northern Ireland because its language is so vague that it can be interpreted in different ways. This paper analyses linguistic categories used in the text of the Agreement to reveal the type of peaceful reality promoted and the constructive ambiguity used to facilitate agreement. It argues that the success of the peace process depended to a large extent on the particular nuances of discourse in and around this crucial document...|$|R

As executive director of the CAJ, O'Brien helped to secure strong human rights provisions in the 1998 <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> Peace <b>Agreement</b> supported by most parties, that set forth a timetable and a structure to create a new power-sharing government in Northern Ireland. It was during O’Brien’s tenure in 1998 that the CAJ was awarded the prestigious Council of Europe Human Rights Prize in recognition of its contribution to protecting and promoting human rights in Northern Ireland.|$|R

40|$|Since {{the advent}} of the <b>Good</b> <b>Friday</b> peace <b>agreement,</b> {{violence}} associated with dissident Irish Republican groups continues to present major security challenges. While {{there has not been a}} tragedy on the scale of the 1998 Omagh bombing, the level of violent dissident Republican (VDR) activity has risen steadily in frequency since then, and in 2010 reached unprecedented levels. This article presents findings from the VDR Project at the International Center for the Study of Terrorism at Pennsylvania State University. The research is based on the extensive identification, collection, and analysis of open source material examining the nature and extent of VDR activity from 1997 to 2010. The project analyses data on VDR activity across this period as well as the individuals taking part in these violent events. The data suggests that while originally recruitment was predominantly southern based it is now more focused on Northern Ireland. Analysis of the data also indicates that the VDR leadership continues to recruit individuals with skill-sets to serve the movement's aims...|$|R
