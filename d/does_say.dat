Experiments involving noxious stimuli and recordings from the dorsal horn of animals revealed that {{referred pain}} sensations began minutes after muscle stimulation. Pain was felt in a receptive field that was some distance away from the original receptive field. According to hyperexcitability, new receptive fields are created {{as a result of the}} opening of latent convergent afferent fibers in the dorsal horn. This signal could then be perceived as referred pain.|$|E
25|$|Al-Tabari {{reports that}} al-Mahdi {{was just about}} to promote Harun as heir {{apparent}} ahead of Musa when he died, and adds by way of corroboration another report that al-Mahdi set off for Masabadhan in a great hurry. However, it may be doubted that al-Mahdi at the time shared the reporter's subsequent knowledge of his imminent demise there, and none of the other reported circumstances of his death suggest that he was in a hurry to go anywhere. On the contrary, the sources in general make it clear that he had gone to Masabadhan for recreation, and they occasionally say so explicitly. Al-Tabari <b>does</b> <b>say</b> explicitly that envoys were sent to the provinces, where they obtained the oath of allegiance not only to al-Hadi as caliph but also to Harun as heir apparent (wali l-'ahd) (38). This was probably the first occasion on which Harun was so acknowledged. Harun himself, with the advice of al-Rabi', sent out these envoys, and all of this must have been presented to his brother on his return as a fait accompli.|$|E
500|$|The {{battle was}} a very costly defeat for the Rus' princes, with Richard Gabriel {{claiming}} that they lost 50,000 men, while the Mongol losses were minimal. All the engaged coalition forces were caught with {{their backs to the}} river, and thus had no feasible line of retreat. Only Msitslav the Bold was able to save some of his army. Out of the Rus' primary sources, The Primary Chronicle gives a number of 10,000 killed while the much later (and much less reliable) Nikonian Chronicle cites 60,000 killed. [...] The Novgorodian First Chronicle (the most reliable), contemporary to the battle, gives no figures at all, but <b>does</b> <b>say</b> that only 1 in 10 soldiers made it back home, suggesting the number of killed was equivalent to almost the entire army. Out of the Rus' princes, the wounded Daniel of Volhynia and Mstislav the Bold managed to escape the battle. This battle was a significant defeat, given that many of the Rus principalities lost much of their armies, with the notable exception of Vladimir-Suzdal. Historian Robert Marshall describes the raid as follows: [...] "The rest of Subutai's campaign has entered the annals of military history {{as one of the greatest}} adventures of cavalry warfare." ...|$|E

500|$|Even the {{truncated}} {{version was}} met with considerable controversy by UK film critics. Dilys Powell in The Sunday Times complained [...] "...17th century hanging, burning, raping, screaming, and Vincent Price as England's prize torture-overseer. Peculiarly nauseating." [...] The Guardian felt the film was filled with [...] "gratuitous sadism." [...] Margaret Hinxman of The Sunday Telegraph dismissed it as a [...] "sadistic extravaganza." [...] Nonetheless, several critics felt the film was worth accolades. John Russell Taylor in the London Times Saturday Review said the film [...] "...is quite happily and deliberately a horror film: that is to say, it has no particular pretensions to being anything else... There is much in it which would win Michael Reeves an important reputation if he were dealing with some more pretentious, but fundamentally no more serious subject... Mr. Reeves is no longer merely promising. He already has real achievements behind him: not merely good horror films, but good films, period." [...] Films and Filming noted, [...] "Witchfinder General has no explicit 'message', but it <b>does</b> <b>say</b> something about the springs of despair and it says it forcefully. It is a very frightening film... Matthew Hopkins {{is the best of}} Price's recent performances. Witchfinder General is emphatically not a horror film; it is, however, a very horrifying one..." [...] Monthly Film Bulletin observed, [...] "Not since Peeping Tom has a film aroused such an outcry about nastiness and gratuitous violence as this one... the tone of the film is oddly muted, with torture and death in plenty, but viewed matter-of-factly and without stress... Throughout the whole film there is a vivid sense of a time out of joint, which comes as much from the stray groups of soldiers who skirmish against unseen attackers in the woods or hang wearily about by the wayside waiting for battle to commence, as from the bloody crimes committed in the name of religion by Matthew Hopkins." ...|$|E

2500|$|There is however, {{little in}} the way of {{completely}} definitive evidence either way. Jewish studies scholar, Philip Mendes suggests that, [...] "It therefore remains an open question as to who was responsible for the bombings," [...] claiming that [...] "memories and interpretations of the events have further been influenced and distorted by the unfortunate discrimination which many Iraqi Jews experienced on their arrival in Israel (Black Panthers 1975:132–133; Shohat 1988; Swirski 1989; Massad 1996)."

2500|$|Sawyer {{produced}} {{a table of}} Viking ship numbers, as documented in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, and assumes that each Viking ship could carry no more than 32 men, leading to his conclusion that the army would have consisted {{of no more than}} 1,000 men. Other scholars give higher estimates. For example, Laurent Mazet-Harhoff observes that many thousands of men were involved in the invasions of the Seine area. However, Mazet-Harhoff <b>does</b> <b>say</b> that the military bases that would accommodate these large armies have yet to be rediscovered. Guy Halshall reported that, in the 1990s, several historians suggested that the Great Heathen Army would have numbered in the low thousands; however, Halshall advises that there [...] "clearly is still much room for debate".|$|E

He does, however, praise Kenney's [...] "adroit use of alliteration, consonance, and assonance," [...] going further to call The Invention of the Zero an [...] "epic rendition of creation"—but not in the religious sense.
