5|$|The {{first stage}} of the {{physical}} restoration was to re-attach any areas of the plaster surface (which was approximately 5mm thick) that {{were in danger of}} separating and breaking away. This was done by injecting a polyvinylacetate resin. Earlier bronze braces that had been used to stabilise surfaces were removed <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> where they were causing cracking, and the holes filled. Pigments that appeared to be not well adhered were consolidated with the application of diluted acrylic resin.|$|E

5|$|Two {{distinct}} functions – {{first that}} of traction by adhesion as in an ordinary loco; second that of traction by pinions {{acting on the}} track bars. The brakes are four in number – two handbrakes, acting by friction; and two acting by preventing the free escape of air from cylinder and thus using compressed air in retarding {{the progress of the}} engine. The former are used for shunting whilst the later for descending steep gradients. One of the handbrakes acts on the tyres of the wheels in the ordinary manner and the second acts on grooved surfaces of the pinion axle, but can be used <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> where the rack is laid.|$|E
5|$|Gods {{were linked}} with {{specific}} {{regions of the}} universe. In Egyptian tradition, the world includes the earth, the sky, and the Duat. Surrounding them is the dark formlessness that existed before creation. The gods in general were said to dwell in the sky, although gods whose roles were linked with {{other parts of the}} universe were said to live <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> instead. Most events of mythology, set in a time before the gods' withdrawal from the human realm, take place in an earthly setting. The deities there sometimes interact with those in the sky. The Duat, in contrast, is treated as a remote and inaccessible place, and the gods who dwell there have difficulty communicating with those {{in the world of the}} living. The space outside the cosmos is also said to be very distant. It too is inhabited by deities, some hostile and some beneficial to the other gods and their orderly world.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Don Valley Parkway was a major undertaking that changed much of the Don valley. While industrial areas existed both {{near the mouth of}} the Don River and the area of today's Leaside Bridge, several natural areas remained <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> where the steep sides of the valley had dissuaded large-scale urban development. The post-war growth period of Toronto provided an impetus to build a new automobile route into central Toronto, and the route through the valley was chosen to avoid expropriation of existing development and provide access for new development in the Metropolitan Toronto region. The {{construction of}} the six-lane highway modified the valley through the removal of hills, other earth works and the rerouting of the Don River. Since completion, the parkway has not been changed significantly, other than adding one partial interchange at Wynford Drive and updating its infrastructure to current standards.|$|E

25|$|Christian missionaries {{recognized}} {{early on}} that the Danes did not worship stone or wooden idols as the north Germans or some Swedes did. They could not simply destroy an image to prove that Christ was a superior god. The great religious sites at Viborg, Lejre, Lund, and Odense were also the location of Denmark's great assembly places (Danish: landsting). Religious sites in Denmark were often located at sacred springs, magnificent beech groves, or isolated hilltops. Missionaries simply asked to build chapels <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>places.</b> Over time the religious significance of the place transferred itself to the chapel.|$|E
25|$|Perry {{had also}} {{properly}} denied the defense motion to suppress evidence obtained via the search warrants of Lazarus's home, cars and workspaces, according to Manella, {{since they were}} based on reasonable assumptions about possibly incriminating evidence that might still be <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> over two decades after the crime—again, supported by existing state and federal case law. And since none of {{the information in the}} search-warrant affidavit was known to be false or shown to have been stated with reckless disregard for its truth, the good-faith exception was validly applied. For the same reason, there was no basis for a Franks hearing.|$|E
25|$|The {{movement}} weathered {{strong opposition}} from virtually all other Hasidic movements in Ukraine throughout the 19th century, {{yet at the}} same time experienced growth in numbers of followers from Ukraine, Belarus, Lithuania and Poland. By World War I, thousands of Breslov Hasidim were located <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>places.</b> After the Bolshevik Revolution, Communist oppression forced the movement underground in Russia. Thousands of Hasidim were imprisoned or murdered during the Great Purge of the 1930s, and killed by Nazis who invaded Ukraine in 1941. The movement was regenerated in the United Kingdom, United States, and Israel by those who escaped, with large numbers of Yemenite Jews and other Mizrahim joining the sect.|$|E

25|$|The {{production}} Prius Plug-in has {{a number}} of key changes from the demonstration units that were deployed in the field for testing based on that experience and customer feedback. The production version has two key modifications from the demonstration vehicle to improve efficiency: the ability to select between EV and hybrid mode, and the ability to recharge the battery from regenerative braking. Toyota decided to include a selectable electric driving mode (EV mode), allowing drivers to conserve energy for use <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> where EV mode is more efficient, such as city driving. Production Prius PHVs may direct the regenerative braking energy to the electric-vehicle battery, rather than the regular hybrid system battery, thus providing additional range in EV mode.|$|E
25|$|Emmel and Perry (2004) {{believed}} {{there to be}} shifts in the relative abundances of the three Orthalicus taxa in the Keys. In the past, Orthalicus floridensis {{was the most common}} and widespread of the three, whereas subsequent to 2000, Emmel and Perry (2004) considered the Orthalicus floridensis to be the rarest. This situation results partly from the translocations that bolstered Orthalicus reses reses distribution and allowed them to avoid extinction, but probably also reflects actual declines in Orthalicus floridensis populations over time. Orthalicus reses reses now occur in sympatry with their congeners in several locations. The observations of Emmel and Perry (2004) suggested that translocated Orthalicus reses reses, all of which are outside the historic range, perform as well or better than congeners <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> where they overlap.|$|E
25|$|Making {{seemingly}} contradictory argument, Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson view strong {{property rights}} and ownership as {{an essential component of}} institutions that produce higher per capita income. They expand on this by saying property rights give individuals the incentive to invest, rather than stockpile, their assets. While this may appear to further encourage colonialists to exert their rights through exploitative behaviors, instead it offers protection to native populations and respects their customary ownership laws. Looking broadly at the European colonial experience, Acemoglu, Johnson, and Robinson explain that exploitation of natives transpired when stable property rights intentionally did not exist. These rights were never implemented in order to facilitate the predatory extraction of resources from indigenous populations. Bringing the colonial experience to the present that, they maintain that broad property rights {{set the stage for the}} effective institutions that are fundamental to strong democratic societies. An example of Acemoglu, Robinson and Johnson hypothesis is in the work of La Porta, et. al. In a study of the legal systems in various countries, La Porta, et. al. found that <b>in</b> <b>those</b> <b>places</b> that were colonized by the United Kingdom and kept its common-law system, the protection of property right is stronger compared to the countries that kept the French civil law.|$|E
