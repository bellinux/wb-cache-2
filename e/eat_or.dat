5|$|In Ancient Rome {{people did}} not <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> drink with the same pottery as that used by someone who was {{affected}}. People of the time would spit on their chest believing that this would keep the problem from affected them. According to Apuleius and other ancient physicians, in order detect epilepsy it was common to light a piece of gagates, whose smoke would trigger the seizure. Occasionally a spinning potter's wheel was used, perhaps a reference to photosensitive epilepsy.|$|E
5|$|Dayton Project {{employees}} {{were not allowed}} to <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> smoke in processing areas, and had to scrub their hands before leaving these areas. They also had to shower {{at the end of each}} day's work, and were subjected to weekly urine tests. Employees with elevated levels of polonium were not allowed in the processing areas. Working with polonium without spreading contamination proved to be almost impossible. Fortunately, it was not a bone-seeker like radium or plutonium, and was readily excreted in urine. Detection methods had already been developed, making it easy to track. The employee at Unit IV with the highest levels of polonium in her urine had contaminated her hair, and often held bobby pins in her mouth.|$|E
5|$|In early 2002, Ebert was {{diagnosed}} with papillary thyroid cancer which was successfully removed in February. In 2003, he underwent surgery for cancer in his salivary gland, which was followed up by radiation treatment. He was again afflicted with cancer in 2006. In June of that year, he had surgery to remove cancerous tissue near his right jaw. A week later he had a life-threatening complication when his carotid artery burst near the surgery site. He was confined to bed rest {{and was unable to}} speak, <b>eat,</b> <b>or</b> drink for a period of time, necessitating the use of a feeding tube.|$|E

5|$|In {{people with}} AD, the {{increasing}} impairment {{of learning and}} memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis. In a small percentage, difficulties with language, executive functions, perception (agnosia), or execution of movements (apraxia) are more prominent than memory problems. AD does not affect all memory capacities equally. Older memories of the person's life (episodic memory), facts learned (semantic memory), and implicit memory (the memory of the body {{on how to do}} things, such as using a fork to <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> how to drink from a glass) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories.|$|E
5|$|Since then, Jackson {{has further}} {{clarified}} {{the origins and}} the nature of the bad blood between the two. According to Jackson, the rivalry exists because he was one of the few fighters in Japan who was not afraid of Silva outside of the ring. Jackson stated that fighters were afraid to <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> be in an elevator with Silva, but he was not one of them. He added that the bad blood is only coming from Silva's end. Silva, on the other hand, cited Jackson's apparent insults towards him on the internet to account for the bad blood in an interview prior to the UFC 92 fight.|$|E
5|$|Some species (such as Tetramorium caespitum) {{attack and}} take over {{neighbouring}} ant colonies. Others are less expansionist, but just as aggressive; they invade colonies to steal eggs or larvae, which they either <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> raise as workers or slaves. Extreme specialists among these slave-raiding ants, such as the Amazon ants, are incapable of feeding themselves and need captured workers to survive. Captured workers of the enslaved species Temnothorax have evolved a counter strategy, destroying just the female pupae of the slave-making Protomognathus americanus, but sparing the males (who don't take part in slave-raiding as adults).|$|E

5|$|Carrion, fungi, fruits such as chokecherry (Prunus virginiana), {{and seeds}} are also eaten. Two grey jays were seen eating slime mold (Fuligo septica) near Kennedy Hot Springs in the Glacier Peak Wilderness, Washington. This {{was the first}} report of any bird {{consuming}} slime mold in the field. Risk and energy expenditure are factors in food selection for the grey jay, which selects food {{on the basis of}} profitability to maximize caloric intake. Increased handling, searching, or recognition times for a preferred food item lowers its profitability. Grey jays wrench, twist, and tug food apart, unlike other birds known as jays (such as the blue jay, Cyanocitta cristata), which grasp and hammer their food. Grey jays commonly carry large food items to nearby trees to <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> process for storage, possibly as defense against large scavengers.|$|E
5|$|Domestic cats select food {{based on}} its temperature, smell and texture; they dislike chilled foods and respond most {{strongly}} to moist foods rich in amino acids, which are similar to meat. Cats may reject novel flavors (a response termed neophobia) and learn quickly to avoid foods that have tasted unpleasant in the past. They may also avoid sugary foods and milk. Most adult cats are lactose intolerant; the sugars in milk are not easily digested and may cause soft stools or diarrhea. They can also develop odd eating habits. Some cats like to <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> chew on other things, most commonly wool, but also plastic, cables, paper, string, aluminum foil, or even coal. This condition, pica, can threaten their health, depending on the amount and toxicity of the items eaten.|$|E

25|$|In Israel {{and other}} {{temperate}} climates (such as Florida, Australia, Texas, and Southern California), observant Jews will often conduct all their eating, studying, and sleeping {{activities in the}} sukkah.

IV fluids are given to treat dehydration, and the patient is placed on bowel rest (meaning nothing to <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> drink) until the symptoms resolve. If possible, cardiac function and oxygenation should be optimized to improve oxygen delivery to the ischemic bowel. A nasogastric tube may be inserted if an ileus is present.|$|E

25|$|In addition, females, {{although}} they did not serve in the Tabernacle or the Temple, were permitted to <b>eat</b> <b>or</b> benefit {{from some of the}} 24 kohanic gifts. However, if a kohens daughter married a man from outside the kohanic line, she was no longer permitted to benefit from the kohanic gifts. Conversely, the daughter of a non-kohen who married a kohen took on the same rights as an unmarried daughter of a kohen.|$|E
