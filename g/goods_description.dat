40|$|Nowadays {{the market}} is {{saturated}} with goods and services, people are always faced {{with the problem of}} selecting the best. The problem of choice became particularly acute when there was a separation of spheres of production. In the result, there was a need to delegate the right to choose an expert in this field. In the history of Russia, like in other countries, at the time of formation of a saturated market, there was a need to identify the manufacturer of high-quality goods and services. The easiest and most affordable way to identify honest manufacturers, whose products have passed the conformity assessment procedures, is the use of heraldic symbol in the <b>goods</b> <b>description.</b> The paper provides a brief history of quality marks in Russia. The article presents the rules developed by the non-profit organization "Roskachestvo" for the selection and evaluation of products, and the registration procedure of the right to use quality mark. The authors analyze factors promoting and impeding the introduction if the quality mark into the daily practice of marking the best domestic products...|$|E
