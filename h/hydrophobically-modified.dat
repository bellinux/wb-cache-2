40|$|A <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> {{polyacrylamide}} and two partially hydrolyzed derivatives containing hydrophobic and carboxylic {{groups were}} prepared by micellar polymerization and post-hydrolysis. The molecular weight, {{second virial coefficient}} and radius of gyration were determined by static light scattering (SLS). Dynamic light scattering (DLS) and small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) were employed to determine the aggregate formation and type of chain packing in the semidilute regime, respectively. The behavior of solutions in dilute and semidilute regimes was also studied by viscometry and rheology. The <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> polyacrylamide showed a tendency to form aggregates due to the hydrophobic groups, {{but not enough to}} increase apparent viscosity. The partially hydrolyzed derivatives did not show the same aggregate-forming tendency. Rather, they exhibited anisotropic behavior, due to the charge density introduced into the polymer chain, which led to a more elongated macromolecular conformation and higher viscosity...|$|E
40|$|Conventional {{delivery}} of anticancer drugs is less effective due to pharmacological drawbacks such {{as lack of}} aqueous solubility and poor cellular accumulation. This study reports the increased drug loading, therapeutic delivery, and cellular accumulation of silibinin (SLB), a poorly water-soluble phenolic compound using a <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> chitosan nanoparticle (pCNP) system. In this study, chitosan nanoparticles were <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> to confer a palmitoyl group as confirmed by 2, 4, 6 -Trinitrobenzenesulfonic acid (TNBS) assay. Physicochemical features of the nanoparticles were studied using the TNBS assay, and Attenuated total reflectance Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (ATR-FTIR) analyses. The FTIR profile and electron microscopy correlated the successful formation of pCNP and pCNP-SLB as nano-sized particles, while Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) and Field Emission-Scanning Electron Microscopy (FESEM) results exhibited an expansion in size between pCNP and pCNP-SLB to accommodate the drug within its particle core. To evaluate the cytotoxicity of the nanoparticles, a Methylthiazolyldiphenyl-tetrazolium bromide (MTT) cytotoxicity assay was subsequently performed using the A 549 lung cancer cell line. Cytotoxicity assays exhibited an enhanced efficacy of SLB when delivered by CNP and pCNP. Interestingly, controlled release {{delivery of}} SLB was achieved using the pCNP-SLB system, conferring higher cytotoxic effects and lower IC 50 values in 72 -h treatments compared to CNP-SLB, which was attributed to the hydrophobic modification of the CNP system...|$|E
40|$|Isothermal {{titration}} microcalorimetry {{has been}} applied to investigate the interactions between <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> water-soluble polymers and surfactants. The following polymers were used in this study: poly(sodium acrylate-co-n-alkyl methacrylate) (A), where n-alkyl = C 9 H 19, C 12 H 25, and C 18 H 37 (percentage of n-alkyl methacrylate to total monomer content ranging from 0 to 8), and poly(acrylamide-co-n-alkyl methacrylate) (B), where n-alkyl = C 12 H 25 (percentage of lauryl methacrylate to total monomer content ranging from 0 to 5). The surfactants were a cyclic (mono-) n-dodecyl sodium phosphate (1) (CMP), a cyclic di-n-dodecyl sodium phosphate (2) (CDP), n-dodecyltrimethylammonium bromide (3) (DTAB), and di-n-dodecyldimethylammonium bromide (4) (DDAB). The following factors were found to influence the interactions between polymers and surfactants: electrostatic forces, polymer hydrophobicity (both the length of the hydrophobic moiety and the degree of hydrophobic modification), and the aggregational states of the amphiphilic molecules, which are micellar for the single-tailed surfactants and vesicular for the double-tailed amphiphiles. We provide evidence that, {{in the case of the}} single-tailed surfactants, individual amphiphilic molecules adsorb onto existing polymeric microdomains. This is in strong contrast with 'classical' polymer-surfactant interactions, where cooperative aggregation of single-tailed amphiphiles in the presence of homopolymers like poly(ethylene oxide) or poly(propylene oxide) was found at concentrations lower than the critical micelle concentration in pure water. In the case of vesicle-forming surfactants, the hydrophobic side chain of the polymer anchors into the bilayers of the vesicles. Non-hydrophobically-modified polymers do not interact at all with the vesicle bilayers. Interestingly, the interactions between single-tailed surfactants and <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> polymers are governed by different factors than the binding of <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> polymers to vesicular bilayers. In the former case, the number and strength of existing (inter) polymeric associations is of importance, and it is particularly the length of the hydrophobic moieties that is decisive. However, for favorable polymer-bilayer interactions it is sufficient that the hydrophobic moieties are long enough to be able to anchor. If this is the case, the number of hydrophobic anchors per polymer molecule further determines the effectiveness of the interaction. Finally, it appears that electrostatic repulsions can be easily overcome by hydrophobic interactions, but added salt facilitates the interactions between equally charged polymers and surfactants...|$|E

The hydrophobized nanoparticles assist carbonic anhydrase B (CAB) refolding {{in a manner}} similar to the mechanism of molecular chaperones, namely by catching and releasing the protein. Irreversible CAB thermal denaturation is prevented by nanoparticle complexation and recovery of almost 100 % of enzymatic activity is triggered by the ability of beta-cyclodextrin to interact with the hydrophobic moieties.

On the other hand, these systems are sometimes related to low chemical and mechanical stability, and the research for new formulations with higher performances is continuously growing. To this aim the investigation of the phase, structural and dynamic properties on a nanometric and subnanometric scale and of their correlations with the final macroscopic behaviour is of fundamental importance. In this field, Solid-State NMR (SSNMR) can givean important contribution since it offers a large variety of tools for the investigation of both structural and dynamic properties, on large spatial (0. 1 - 100 nm) and frequency ranges, of amorphous polymeric materials.

These well-engineered dendritic molecules offer scientists with challenges and exciting opportunities. Dendrimers have numerous potential applications in chemical, biological, medicinal and materials research which have been facilitated by their commercial availability. In this work, we chose the second generation poly(propylene imine) (PPI, DAB-dendr-(NH 2) 8) dendrimer as starting material. A series of <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> dendrimers were prepared by using fatty acid chlorides. The modified dendrimers are amphiphiles which contain a hydrophilic (water-loving) core (head) and eight hydrophobic (water-fearing) tails. These dendrimers are designed to be interfacial stabilization agents between electrode and electrolyte in lithium batteries, and so how these dendrimers behave on flat surface is very intriguing to us.

With the exception of the highly pathogenic SARS and MERS coronaviruses, human coronaviruses (HCoV-NL 63, HCoV-OC 43, HCoV- 229 E, and HCoV-HKU 1) circulate worldwide and typically cause the common cold. In most cases, infection with these viruses does not lead to severe disease, although acute infections in infants, the elderly, and immunocompromised patients may progress to severe disease requiring hospitalization. Importantly, no drugs against human coronaviruses exist, and only supportive therapy is available. Previously, we proposed the cationically modified chitosan, N-(2 -hydroxypropyl) - 3 -trimethylammonium chitosan chloride (HTCC), and its <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> derivative (HM-HTCC) as potent inhibitors of the coronavirus HCoV-NL 63.

40|$|Most {{existing}} eyedrop formulations consist {{primarily of}} dilute solutions of water-soluble polymers. While these solutions provide temporary relief of dry eye or {{a means to}} transport a drug to the cornea, dilute solutions are quickly cleared from the eye via blinking, resulting in low drug uptake {{and the need for}} multiple treatments per day. In contrast, more viscous polymer solutions can cause discomfort or irritation of the ocular surface. Highly shear-thinning polymer solutions that can flow upon the application of shear but form gels at rest and (even more ideally) act to stabilize the tear film would instead be ideal for eyedrop formulations. Poly(oligoethylene glycol methacrylate) -based hyperbranched polymers (prepared by the Strathclyde methodology using dodecanethiol as a chain transfer agent to graft hydrophobes on chain ends in a single step) represent a unique polymer building block intermediate between a nanoparticle and a linear polymer.

40|$|Infant skin is {{different}} from adult in structure, function, and composition. Despite these differences, the skin barrier is competent at birth in healthy, full-term neonates. The primary focus {{of this paper is}} on the developing skin barrier in healthy, full-term neonates and infants. Additionally, a brief discussion of the properties of the skin barrier in premature neonates and infants with abnormal skin conditions (i. e., atopic dermatitis and eczema) is included. As infant skin continues to mature through the first years of life, it is important that skin care products (e. g., cleansers and emollients) are formulated appropriately. Ideally, products that are used on infants should not interfere with skin surface pH or perturb the skin barrier. For cleansers, this can be achieved by choosing the right type of surfactant, by blending surfactants, or by blending <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> polymers (HMPs) with surfactants to increase product mildness. Similarly, choosing the right type of oil for emollients is important. Unlike some vegetable oils, mineral oil is more stable and is not subject to oxidation and hydrolysis. Although emollients can improve the skin barrier, more studies are needed to determine the potential long-term benefits of using emollients on healthy, full-term neonates and infants...|$|E

These hydrophobic and non-functionalized MPs have magnetic properties that {{are suitable for}} various biological applications.

Certain surface modifications of MPs, such as attaching silane groups and silica coating, lead to formation of more complex structures of superparamagnetic and fluorescent silica microspheres and nanostructures. These microspheres and nanostructures comprising MPs and semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are useful tools for biological applications such as for magnetically controlling with fluorescent tracking of particles and for bimodal imaging. Surface modifications of MPs with <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> polyacrylic acid (mPAA) amphiphilic polymer and catechol-derivative surfactants resulted in hydrophilic MPs that are stable in physiological environment and small in their hydrodynamic size.

40|$|AbstractInteractions of <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> poly-(N-isopropylacrylamides) (HM PNIPAM) with {{phospholipid}} liposomes {{were studied}} {{as a function}} of the lipid type, the lipid bilayer fluidity, and the polymer conformation. Fluorescence experiments monitoring non-radiative energy transfer (NRET), between naphthalene attached to the HM PNIPAM and 1, 6 -diphenyl- 1, 3, 5 -hexatriene (DPH) incorporated into the lipid bilayer, confirmed the direct penetration of hydrophobic anchor groups linked to the polymer into the liposome hydrophobic core. Contraction of the polymer backbone above the lower critical solution temperature (LCST) resulted in a partial withdrawal of the anchor groups from the lipid bilayer. Analysis of polymer/lipid mixtures by centrifugation and quasi-elastic light scattering (QELS) revealed the polymer-induced fission of liposomes in the liquid-crystalline state, resulting in the formation of vesicles 150 – 230 nm in diameter. The process is reversible and upon transition of the bilayer into the gel state these vesicles are converted into larger aggregates. According to the results of gel-filtration experiments the HM PNIPAM is in dynamic exchange between the liquid-crystalline lipid bilayer and the water solution, while the binding to the bilayer in the gel state is more static in nature.

Poly(diallylamine-co-N,N-dodecylmethyldiallylammonium bromide) (PDA-C 12), poly(N-methyldiallyl-co-N,N-dodecylmethyldiallylammonium bromide) (PMDA-C 12) both contain hydrophobic side chains with 12 carbon atoms. The swelling behavior of these polysoap hydrogels was studied by immersion of the gels in buffered solutions at various pHs and ionic strengths. It {{was found that the}} structure of the polysoap backbone influenced the pH-dependent swelling and deswelling. The swelling process is reversible after repeating cycles of swelling and deswelling induced by a change of pH in appropriate buffer solutions. SEM micrographs of polysoap gels indicate that the network structures are characterized by the presence of large open pores or small closed pores. The stimuli response of the polysoap gels in electric fields was also investigated. In a contact electric field, deswelling was observed at the anode side of the gels. In a non-contact electric field, the gels bend towards the anode. The gels can turn back to the original shape and bend toward the cathode with time when higher electric potentials are applied. These properties of the gels are related to both the change of osmotic pressure caused by mobile ions and by hydrophobic interactions. ...|$|E

The <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> PEGs (HMPEGs) are comb-graft polymers with strictly alternating monodisperse PEG blocks (Mw= 6, 12, or 35 kDa) bonded to C 18 stearylamide hydrophobes. Cooperativity is varied {{by changing the}} degree of oligomerization at a constant ratio of PEG to stearylamide. Fusogenic liposomes prepared from N-C 12 -DOPE:DOPC 7 : 3 (mol:mol) were equilibrated with HMPEGs. Affinity for polymer association to liposomes increases with the degree of oligomerization; equilibrium constants (given as surface coverage per equilibrium concentration of free polymer) for 6 kDa PEG increased from 6. 1 ± 0. 8 (mg/m 2) /(mg/ml) for 2. 5 loops to 78. 1 ± 12. 2 (mg/m 2) /(mg/ml) for 13 loops. In contrast, the equilibrium constant for distearoylphosphatidylethanolamine-poly(ethylene glycol) (DSPE-PEG 5 k) was 0. 4 ± 0. 1 (mg/m 2) /(mg/ml). The multi-loop HMPEGs demonstrate higher levels of protection from complement binding than DSPE-PEG 5 k. Greater protection does not correlate with binding strength alone. The best shielding was by HMPEG 6 k-DP 3 (with three 6 kDa PEG loops), suggesting that PEG chains with adequate surface mobility provide optimal protection from complement opsonization. Complement binding at 30 min and 12 h demonstrates that protection by multi-looped PEGs is constant whereas DSPE-PEG 5 k initially protects but presumably partitions off of the surface at longer times...|$|E

40|$|This project {{consists}} of two parts. One area of focus {{in the first part}} is understanding the interactions between a non-ionic, block copolymer type dispersant and <b>hydrophobically-modified,</b> ethoxylated urethane (HEUR) associative thickeners in water. The dispersant was mixed at various concentrations (0 - 2 % by weight) with HEUR thickeners at 1 % by weight concentration in the aqueous medium. This study {{is an integral part of}} our attempts to determine mechanisms of viscosity drop when colorant dispersions are added to latex tint base formulations thickened with associative thickeners. One of the HEUR thickeners is a product that has been available for over three decades (HEUR RM- 825), whereas the other, HEUR RM- 995 is a product recently introduced to minimize the tint base viscosity drop. The old HEUR showed a definitive viscosity maximum as a function of the dispersant concentration. However, the new generation product did not indicate a viscosity maximum within the dispersant concentration range studied; instead it showed a small, but linear increase in viscosity as dispersant level was increased. The next area of focus was on understanding the phase behavior, rheology, and interactions between polymer latex particles and a <b>hydrophobically-modified,</b> ethoxylated urethane (HEUR) associative thickener in water. The influence of the addition of surfactant in some of the systems was also studied. Several types of dispersions were made using two types of polymer latex, two associative thickeners, and two surfactants. Mixtures containing a small particle size acrylic latex and HEUR RM- 825 exhibited the most interesting and complex phase behavior and rheology. In experiments wherein the latex particle volume fraction was kept constant, the addition of HEUR caused stable, followed by phase separated (syneresis) and stable mixtures as HEUR concentration was increased. The observed phase behavior is consistent with previous work reported by other investigators. However, detailed rheological data on systems such as these have not been reported, and this report presents the rheological data and correlate rheology with the phase behavior. The stable latex-HEUR mixtures at low HEUR levels show shear-thinning viscosity with well-defined low-shear Newtonian plateaus. As HEUR level is increased wherein syneresis is observed, erratic rheological profiles with shear-thickening are observed. When HEUR level is increased to a region where no syneresis is observed, low shear Newtonian plateaus re-appeared albeit at higher viscosities. The effects of added non-ionic and anionic surfactants on the dispersion are also studied. The main focus of the second part of this project is hybrid organic-inorganic photovoltaics. They have been the focus of recent studies due to their promising use in low-cost, flexible electronics, which can be processed from solution by printing and coating techniques. Understanding the rheology of these nanocomposites is essential in controlling shear flows during printing and application processes. Through rheology, we can determine different properties of poly(3 -hexylthiophene) and dodecanethiol (DDT) modified zinc oxide (ZnO-DDT). Semiconductor nanowires such as ZnO have rigid or rod-like macromolecule geometry. Therefore, they have a tendency to have a lytropic liquid crystal (LLC) phase. LLC orders occur spontaneously in solutions with rod-shaped or anistropic objects from isotropic phase to nematic phase above a critical volume fraction which was studied using ZnO-DDT. The shear-induced alignment of the liquid crystal molecules was analyzed, serving as a guide for LLC printing. Furthermore by using this nanocomposite we are able to induced gelation using the ZnO-DDT nanowires in what is considered as a “good solvent,” dichlorobenzene. The kinetics of this gelation process was determined to be of first-order reaction kinetics. Furthermore, a mechanism of this gelation process is also presented...|$|E

We investigated surfactant-induced wetting of C 18 -modified silica gel with aqueous solution by means of fluorescence spectroscopy, confocal fluorescence imaging and multi-photon excitation imaging. Ratiometric imaging with solvatochromic probe Prodan revealed the nanotransport of intact surfactant micelles inside the hydrophobic nanopores. The influence of hydrophobic and electrostatic effects on the distribution of fluorescent probe molecules in the C 18 -particle-surfactant system was addressed by employing positively and negatively charged water-soluble probes, rhodamine 6 G and fluorescein, respectively. The methodology for the preparation of surfactant-decorated particles with retained internal hydrophobicity was evaluated by means of confocal fluorescence imaging. C 18 -derivatized nanoporous silica particles were incorporated in the design of semi-solid three-dimensional tissue phantoms. Patient-to-patient differences and complexity of the biochemical environments cause significant variation in the spectral characteristics of cancerous tissues. The use of tissue phantoms with controlled boundaries of optical features can assist in the development of optical biopsy methods. The phantoms were composed of hydrophobic nanoporous silica beads loaded with an endogenous tissue fluorophore, flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), and imbedded in 1 % agar gel. Uniform 10 -micron silica particles serve as perfect imaging objects for testing optical biopsy methods, providing features of known dimensions and shapes. Efficacies of methods for the analysis of autofluorescence tissue spectra were compared. Evaluated methods included: principle peak ratio (PPR), differential normalized fluorescence (DNF), bivariate DNF (2 D-DNF), principal component analysis (PCA) and correlation coefficient mapping (CCM). Comparison was achieved by performing diagnosis in a large simulated tissue-phantom data set. The use of simulation in this study ensured the comparison of methods in nearly the entire sample space, while avoiding environmental and patient-to-patient variation biases.

40|$|The {{electrostatic}} and hydrophobic {{interactions in}} aqueous solutions of <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> water-soluble non-ionic or ionic polymers, their mixtures {{with a second}} polymer, nonionic or of opposite charge, and their mixtures with surfactants of opposite charge have been investigated. The relative strength of the electrostatic and hydrophobic contributions has been modulated by {{a variation of the}} polymer charge density and the solution pH, and by a variation in the degree and strength of the hydrophobic modifications, respectively. The repercussions of such interactions on the thermodynamics and dynamics of the systems under study have been quantified experimentally with the aid of phase behavior, rheology, and light scattering techniques, and have been rationalized theoretically in the context of dynamic scaling theory. The association between two oppositely charged hydrophobically modified polyelectrolytes can lead to the formation of soluble or insoluble mixtures depending on the mixture composition, the total polymer concentration, and the charge density of the polyions. The simultaneous presence of ionic and hydrophobic groups in both polymers results in a broad miscibility region (instead of the precipitate expected if only electrostatics were in effect), where the viscosity is three to four orders of magnitude higher than that of the solutions of the individual polymers. The physical networks obtained through the formation of mixed aggregates are especially reinforced in the proximity of phase separation as revealed by the existence of two relaxation modes, a fast diffusive mode and a slow mode (attributed to enhanced hydrophobic associations) in the time correlation data obtained from light scattering measurements. The network dynamics are strongly affected by the presence of the hydrophobic moieties and by the mixture composition, thus making the hydrophobically modified polyelectrolyte mixtures exhibit rheological properties of complex scaling behavior. However, the binary mixtures of unmodified polyelectrolytes as well as the single polyelectrolyte solutions exhibit a viscosity scaling behavior in good agreement with recent predictions of the dynamic scaling theory of polyelectrolytes in the semidilute regime. The interactions between polymers and surfactants of opposite charge in aqueous solutions can lead to the formation of transient networks, the rheological properties of which have been modulated via the addition of cyclodextrins. Cyclodextrins can form inclusion complexes with the hydrophobic moieties of surfactants, and thus they disrupt the polymer-surfactant network as evidenced by their ability to reverse the high viscosities exhibited by such networks...|$|E
40|$|Vesicles are hollow spherical {{structures}} {{formed by}} the self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules in aqueous solution. They are of great interest for applications ranging from drug delivery and controlled release to separations and sensing. However, the limited stability of vesicles to external conditions such as pH, temperature or ionic strength has hampered their applicability. In this dissertation, we explore the integration of vesicles with biopolymers as a route to creating vesicle-bearing soft materials with increased stability. Two specific types of such materials are studied: (a) vesicle gels, where the vesicles are linked into a network by biopolymer chains; and (b) vesicle-loaded capsules, where the vesicles are embedded in biopolymer-based capsules. The materials we have developed could be useful for the controlled and targeted release of drugs, cosmetics, and other chemicals. The {{first part of this}} dissertation focuses on vesicle gels, obtained by adding a <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> polysaccharide, chitosan (denoted as hm-chitosan) to a solution of surfactant vesicles. The resulting gel shows an elastic rheological response, and is able to hold its own weight upon tube inversion. Small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) and cryo-transmission electron microscopy (cryo-TEM) are used to confirm the existence of vesicles within the gel. Based on these results, the likely structure in these gels is a network of vesicles connected by hm-chitosan chains, with the hydrophobes on the polymer embedded in vesicle bilayers. The SANS and cryo-TEM data also reveal interesting differences in the morphology of the vesicles at low and high polymer concentrations. In particular, adding a high concentration of polymer to unilamellar vesicles is shown to transform some of these into bilamellar (double-bilayered) structures. A similar co-existence of unilamellar and bilamellar vesicles is observed in all eukaryotic cells, {{but this is the first}} systematic demonstration of the phenomenon in an in vitro formulation. The final part of this dissertation focuses on vesicle-loaded capsules. Capsules are created spontaneously when a solution of a cationic biopolymer is added dropwise into a solution of an anionic biopolymer. The driving force for capsule formation is the electrostatic interaction between the biopolymers at the interface of the drop. We modify the above procedure to create capsules with embedded vesicles. Additionally, to demonstrate the potential use of these capsules in targeted drug delivery, we load them with magnetic nanoparticles, and attach antibodies to the capsule surface. Controlled release experiments are conducted with both the vesicle-bearing capsules and with the vesicle gels. In each case, a model dye encapsulated in the vesicles is shown to release slowly over an extended period of time due to the combination of transport resistances from the vesicle bilayer and the capsule/gel. The results indicate the potential utility of these materials for drug delivery applications...|$|E

There are two kinds of rheology modifiers used in waterborne coatings; associative thickeners and non-associative thickeners. Coatings formulated with associative thickeners are quite sensitive to coating variations; the slightest change in the formulation has profound effects on the rheology of the coating. The opposite is true for coatings formulated with non-associative thickeners, where the rheology of the coating is not affected by minor changes in the formulation. The rheological properties of coatings are most influenced by the latex, thickener, and surfactant components of the coating. Previous {{studies have shown that the}} most ideal balance of rheological properties come from using associative thickeners. However, when waterborne coatings with associative thickeners are tinted with colorants containing high levels of surfactants they exhibit a significant decrease in viscosity. This change in viscosity results in poor sag resistance, poor brush loading, and may also cause a reduction in tint strength of the coating. In this work, the effect of tinting paints with six different colorants on the viscosity of the paint was studied for four different paint formulations: a pastel base and a deeptone base formulated with hydroxyethylcellulose (HEC-type) non-associative thickeners, and a pastel base and a deeptone base formulated with <b>hydrophobically-modified,</b> ethoxylated polyurethane (HEUR-type) associative thickeners. Gloss values and tinting strengths were obtained in accordance with ASTM methods D 523 - 08 and D 4838 - 88. In addition, dynamic stress and frequency sweeps were taken in order to study the effect of colorant addition on the viscoelastic properties of each sample. Colorant addition had little to no effects on the viscosity of the bases formulated with HEC thickeners, while there was a dramatic decrease in viscosity upon colorant addition to the bases with HEUR thickeners. Similar results were observed in the viscoelastic property analysis: little to no effects on the elastic and viscous moduli was seen with the tinted coatings formulated with the non-associative thickeners, while both the elastic and viscous moduli decreased for the coatings formulated with associative thickeners. A few of the deeptone bases showed increased moduli upon tinting compared to the parent deeptone base. The addition of colorant resulted in a decrease in tinting strength and an increase in gloss for those samples with associative thickeners, while the opposite was found for those samples with non-associative thickeners...|$|E
40|$|This thesis will be {{in three}} parts {{describing}} three projects which investigated different areas of new materials science {{in the context of}} nanotechnological chemistry. The parts include: the synthesis and characterisation of novel metalloporphyrin complexes with the geometry of ‘molecular cogs’; physical analysis of simple, new cyclodextrin-based inclusion compounds, and attempts to generate rotaxanes there-from; and analysis of the behaviour of aromatic <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> water-soluble polymers as components in supramolecular complexing complementary polymer systems. A synthetic approach through a vinyl sulfone–modified Barton and Zard pyrrole was successfully utilised. It was envisaged that this functionality could be extended further into a cyclic spiro substituent: where the spiro functionality incorporated aromaticity, it would constitute a planar, non-rotating substituent arranged orthogonally to the macrocyclic plane. Symmetrical, tetraspiro annulated porphyrin systems including indanyl and fluorenyl derivatives were synthesised and spectroscopically characterised. The fluorenyl-derived zinc metalloporphyrin gave suitable crystals for X-ray crystallographic analysis. The design and synthesis of a series of cyclodextrin inclusion compounds incorporating relatively simple amino-substituted biaryl axle was carried out. The pseudorotaxanes were asymmetric in character, incorporating functionalised homo- and heteroaromatic rings at either end, joined by an unsaturated linker. The heterocycle was an azine ring (pyridine or pyrimidine), and therefore bore one or more nitrogen protonation sites; pK[subscript]a s in water-methanol solutions were determined. Distinct inclusion in a-cyclodextrin was observed and quantified in dilute basic aqueous solution by UV-visible spectroscopy. Corresponding inclusion in concentrated acidic conditions was studied through 2 D NMR techniques, revealing a clear temperature dependence for the a-cyclodextrin/pyridine based axle, and site-exchange analysis was performed to determine the rate of inclusion compound formation. Generation of corresponding rotaxanes was not achieved, most likely due to the reactivity of azine ring-bound amine groups in the necessary reaction conditions. The range of hydrophobically modified polymers was expanded by appending amide- bonded aromatic side chains to poly(acrylic acid), to give phenyl-, diphenyl-, naphthyl- and anthryl-type modification. This procedure allowed control over the molecular weights of the polymer products, and a degree of direction of the amount of each new polymer’s modification observed primarily through 2 D NMR techniques, and absorbance/fluorescence where applicable. It was generally found that aromatic substituents lacked the tendency to aggregate in solution that is observed for long polymer-bound alkyl groups. This is likely due to the relative length and rigidity of aromatic species. For naphthyl and anthryl groups excimer emission would be a likely consequence of aggregation but its absence suggests that π-CH hydrophobic association between aromatic groups and the alkane backbone is more favoured. For the anthryl- bearing polymer in particular this means that the likely form of substitution consistent with the fluorescence data is not suitable for studying anthracene fluorescence behaviour in an aqueous-polymer environment. The interactions of these modified polymers with native α- and β-cyclodextrin and the corresponding cyclodextrin-modified PAAs in aqueous solution were assessed with 2 D NOESY NMR spectroscopy.

40|$|The {{self-assembly}} {{of several}} pyrene-labelled amphiphilic macromolecules in water {{was characterized by}} fluorescence. Information on their self-assembly was obtained by monitoring the level of pyrene aggregation in solution. A measure {{of the level of}} association was obtained by determining the fraction of aggregated pyrene of the labelled macromolecules from the global analysis of their monomer and excimer fluorescence decays. Global analysis limits the degrees of freedom of the analysis thus reducing the error on the parameters retrieved from the analysis. Extensive developments in the global analysis of the pyrene monomer and excimer decays enabled the first characterization of the molar absorbance coefficient of the pyrene aggregates formed by aqueous solutions of pyrene-labelled poly(N,N-dimethylacrylamide) (PyPDMA) and poly(ethylene oxide) (PyPEO). The molar absorbance coefficients of the pyrene aggregates determined for PyPDMA and PyPEO were both found to be broader and red-shifted compared to that of unaggregated pyrene. These results agree with observations found in the scientific literature made by using absorption and excitation fluorescence measurements. Attempts to determine the molar absorbance coefficient of pyrene-labelled <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> alkali-swellable emulsion (PyHASE) polymers were unsuccessful. The inability to characterize the pyrene aggregates of PyHASE was attributed to the greater complexity of the PyHASE polymer compared to PyPDMA and PyPEO. For these simpler pyrene-labelled polymers, a protocol has been established which uses the global analysis of the pyrene monomer and excimer decays to determine quantitatively the level of association of pyrene-labelled polymers as well as the molar absorbance coefficient of their aggregates. Changes in the level of aggregation of pyrene-labelled lipids (PLLs) having head groups bearing an alcohol (PSOH) or imido diacetic acid (PSIDA) embedded in 1 -palmitoyl- 2 -oleyl- 3 -sn-phosphatidylcholines (POPC) or distearylphosphatidylcholine (DSPC) liposomes were probed by fluorescence. Distribution of the PLLs in the fluid POPC membrane was found to be homogeneous while the PLLs phase-separated into amorphous channels created in the DSPC membranes. Multivalent cations Cu 2 + and La 3 + were found to bind to PSIDA, hindering diffusional encounters between unaggregated PSIDA but leaving the PLL aggregates intact. Using the fluorescence quenching ability of Cu 2 +, the viscosity of the amorphous channels of the DSPC membrane was determined to be about six times greater than that of the more fluid POPC membrane. 	Simultaneous rheological and fluorescence measurements were achieved by interfacing a rheometer with time-resolved and steady-state fluorometers using fiber-optic cables. This joint set up enabled the simultaneous rheological and fluorescence measurements of PyHASE solutions having concentrations ranging from 0. 5 w/w% to 5 w/w%. The level of association of the PyHASE solutions was tracked using fluorescence at shear rates of 0, 0. 1 and 100 s– 1. Despite the presence of shear thinning leading to viscosity drops of up to four orders of magnitude, no change in the fluorescence and hence the level of association was observed. The lack of change in level of association implied that the mechanism of shear thinning is due to a switching from inter- to intramolecular association rather than a drop in the level of association. This information will prove useful for future models attempting to predict the rheological behaviour of sheared associative polymers...|$|E
40|$|Rheology {{modifiers}} {{are used}} in paints and coatings to ease their application to a surface, prevent sagging once applied, and allow the leveling of brushstrokes, among other benefits. The early rheology modifiers were hydroxyethyl celluloses (HECs), a type of non-associative thickener that is relatively inexpensive and synthesized from cellulose, which is abundant. However, coatings that are modified with HECs tend to suffer from poor leveling and syneresis (phase separation). HECs have since been replaced with associative thickeners (ATs). These thickeners, when properly formulated, produce stable dispersions that have improved rheological properties, yet, unlike HECs, are sensitive to changes to the coating formulation. This drawback has encouraged research that attempts to predict the phase behavior and rheology of systems that are modified with ATs. This work {{is concerned with the}} phase behavior and rheology of waterborne latex / <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> ethoxylated urethane (HEUR) AT systems. When latex volume fraction is held constant, the amount of HEUR (and surfactant) in the mixture determines whether the system experiences syneresis. Dispersion phase diagrams (DPDs) of such systems have been previously studied, but the rheology of the mixtures used to prepare the DPDs have not been studied in any detail. A study on the rheology of phase separated latex / HEUR mixtures that were prepared with commercial materials was done at Cal Poly and showed a correlation between syneresis and complex rheology. However, a proper analysis was limited because the compositions and chemical structures of the commercial materials were not well known. To better understand the relationships between phase behavior and rheology, waterborne latex / HEUR mixtures were prepared from latex and HEURs that were made at Cal Poly. Three series of mixtures were studied: commercial latex / commercial HEUR (I), commercial latex / Cal Poly HEUR (II), and Cal Poly latex / Cal Poly HEUR (III). The latex volume fraction was held constant at 0. 25 and the concentration of HEUR was varied from 0 – 2. 0 wt%. Mixtures were allowed to equilibrate for 7 days, syneresis was measured on day 7, and steady-state viscosities over a shear rate range of 0. 01 – 1000 s- 1 were determined on days 7 – 9 with a DHR- 2 rheometer (TA Instruments) that was outfitted with 40 mm, 2 o cone. The mixtures were also studied by microscopy and dynamic oscillatory testing. The chemical structures of the Cal Poly HEURs were determined by proton nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (1 H NMR) and the molecular weight by gel permeation chromatography (GPC). From this study, a correlation between syneresis and complex rheology was observed in I. Similar trends were observed in phase-separated II and dispersed (not phase-separated) III, though II with over 0. 4 wt% HEUR were ejected from the cone / plate geometry at 1 – 100 s- 1 and III did not demonstrate syneresis. Further investigation of dispersed II and phase-separated III is recommended to confirm the presence of the syneresis–rheology correlation of I in both II and III. In addition to these trends, only 2. 1 – 4. 2 wt% II were able to be analyzed by the single-mode Maxwell model. Also the transition from phase-separated to stable dispersion was observed with a polarized microscopy at 5 x magnification. In conclusion this study represents progress in the ongoing study at Cal Poly to better understanding the mechanisms behind the syneresis and rheology of these latex / HEUR AT dispersions...|$|E

The ability to control triple helix formation or higher order assemblies of collagen peptides would be useful for biomaterial applications. We have engineered a pH-responsive CTH peptide that includes modified hydroxyproline residues with a carboxylate moiety (P E) along the collagen peptide. The introduction of one or three P E residues into a collagen peptide had little effect on triple helix stability at acidic and neutral pH. However, the introduction of five or seven PE residues within a collagen peptide demonstrated that a CTH may form under acidic conditions, but not at neutral pH. These data support a pH dependent CTH formation. Furthermore, we used the PE residues to perturb the folding in localized sites along the collagen peptide due to the negative charges. We demonstrated that the addition of PE residues into collagen peptides affects the folding of the CTH, as well as the thermal stability. Increasing the numbers of charged PE residues within the peptide was found to reduce the refolding rate of CTH formation due to electrostatic repulsion. Moreover, the specific placement of PE residues within the collagen peptide allowed us to selectively test for possible terminal and central nucleation. These studies indicate that incorporation of PE residues may be a strategy to study the folding mechanism of collagen peptides. ^ Our strategy was further expanded to promote the higher order assembly of collagen triple helices by electrostatic interactions from charges found on the modified hydroxyproline residues. The negative and positive charges were introduced into a (Pro-Hyp-Gly) 9 scaffold through modification of the hydroxyproline residues with carboxylate (PE) and amine (PK) functionality by O-alkylation. Combination of the two triple helical collagen peptides, the negatively charged 3 / 3 E/ 3 and the positively charged 3 / 3 K/ 3, was found to facilitate radial growth of collagen structures via electrostatic interactions into disk shaped nanostructures. This study suggests that the higher order assembly of collagen triple helices could be promoted by electrostatic interactions with varied environmental conditions resulting in a different morphology for the assembled structure with a different growth mechanism. ^ Our strategy to control the supramolecular assembly of collagen peptides was further extended to use of hydrophobic interactions. Incorporation of a <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> hydroxyproline residue (PL) into collagen peptides allowed us to observe different assembly characteristics depending on the position of the hydrophobic PPLG units in the peptide. The PPLG- 4 T peptide, containing PPLG units at the C- and N-termini of the peptide, was found to form heterotrimers with a neutral and shorter POG- 7 peptide through a heat-triggered or self-triggered mechanism. The hydrophobic sticky ends generated by the formation of heterotrimers offer the possibility for head to tail assembly. The PPLG- 4 G peptide, containing hydrophobic segments embedded within a (Pro-Hyp-Gly) 10 peptide, was able to form round assemblies suggesting that it may grow in radial direction via hydrophobic interactions. These results suggest that functionalizing collagen peptides by alternating the position of the PL residues may trigger the peptide to perform strand-invasion or self-assembly. ^ Metal coordination has been a powerful strategy to promote higher order assemblies in collagen model peptides. We incorporated Gla (γ-carboxyglutamic acid) residues into a collagen peptide to investigate the metal-promoted higher order assembly of CTH. The Gla- 1 peptide, containing a central Gla residue, was able to form assembled structures with various metals, including LaCl 3, FeCl 3 and GdCl 3. Metal-assisted assembled micro- or nano-structures of Gla- 1 were found with a variety of morphologies and sizes. Our various strategies for controlling triple helical conformation or higher order assemblies of collagen peptides could provide the basis for new biomaterial applications. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} pyrene end-labeled {{monodisperse}} poly(ethylene oxide) s (PEO(X) -Py 2 where X represents the number {{average molecular weight}} (Mn) of the PEOs and equals 2, 5, 10 and 16. 5 K) and one pyrene mono-labeled PEO (PEO(2 K) -Py 1) were synthesized and characterized in solution using fluorescence. First, the end-to-end cyclization (EEC) of PEO(X) -Py 2 was investigated in seven organic solvents with viscosities (η) ranging from 0. 32 to 1. 92 mPa•s. The classical Birks scheme was used to globally fit the pyrene monomer and excimer fluorescence decays. The fraction of pyrenes that did not form excimer (ffree) was found to increase with increasing η and Mn. This result was contrary to the assumptions made by Birks’ scheme. To account for this, ffree was assumed to represent the fraction of PEO chains other than the monolabeled polymer impurities that cannot accomplish EEC. A fluorescence blob model (FBM) was applied to handle this assumption in the process of excimer formation for the PEO(X) -Py 2 samples in solution. The radius of a blob, Rblob, in organic solvents was determined according to the results retrieved from the FBM. To quantitatively account for the existence of pyrene impurity in pyrene-labeled macromolecules, known amounts of PEO(2 K) -Py 1 were added into a PEO(2 K) -Py 2 solution and the fluorescence decays were fitted globally according to the Birks scheme and “model free” (MF) analysis to verify the validation of the MF analysis. The MF analysis was then applied to determine the amounts of 1 -pyrenebutyric acid (PyBA) that had been added to a solution of pyrene end-labeled fourth generation dendritic hybrid (Py 16 -G 4 -PS). The results demonstrated that the contribution from unwanted fluorescent species could be isolated and quantitatively accounted for by fitting the fluorescence decays of the pyrene monomer and excimer globally with the MF analysis. Since the PEO(X) -Py 2 samples form hydrophobic pyrene aggregates in aqueous solution, a sequential model (SM) was proposed to characterize the pyrene excimer formation of PEO(X) -Py 2 in water at different polymer concentration (CP). The capture distance over which the pyrenyl end-groups experience hydrophobic forces in water was determined by assuming that the end-to-end distances of the PEO(X) -Py 2 samples adopt a Gaussian distribution and that the fraction of pyrenes that are aggregated (fE 0) determined by the sequential model corresponds to the fraction of PEO(X) -Py 2 chains whose end-to-end distance is smaller than the hydrophobic capture distance. Since a surfactant can interact with a hydrophobically modified water-soluble polymer in aqueous solution, the interactions taking place between PEO(X) -Py 2 and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) were investigated at a low PEO(X) -Py 2 concentration. The pyrene monomer and excimer fluorescence decays of the PEO(X) -Py 2 and SDS solutions were acquired at various SDS concentrations and globally fitted according to the MF analysis to retrieve the parameters that described the kinetics of pyrene excimer formation. At high SDS concentrations above the critical micelle concentration (CMC), the pyrene end-groups of the short-chain samples (PEO(2 K) -Py 2 and PEO(5 K) -Py 2) were incorporated inside the same micelle and excimer was formed intramolecularly, while most pyrene groups of the long-chain samples (PEO(10 K) -Py 2 and PEO(16. 5 K) -Py 2) were isolated into different micelles. Lastly, both the rheological properties and fluorescence behavior of a pyrene-labeled <b>hydrophobically-modified</b> alkali-swellable emulsion (Py-HASE) polymer in basic aqueous solution with SDS were studied. Furthermore, a joint experimental setup that combined a rheometer and a steady-state fluorometer was applied to investigate at the molecular level the effect that a shearing force had on the polymeric network. However, despite the dramatic decrease in solution viscosity with increasing shear rate, no change in the fluorescence spectra was detected, suggesting that changes in the polymeric network that affected the balance of intra- versus intermolecular pyrene associations did not impact the process of excimer formation. Together the experiments described in this thesis represent the broadest set of examples found in the scientific literature where information on the dynamics and level of association of pyrene-labeled polymers has been retrieved through the quantitative analysis of the fluorescence decays acquired with pyrene-labeled polymers in solution...|$|E
