Spectral-domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) images were obtained for all patients. We investigated {{the relationship between the}} hyperreflective <b>foci</b> <b>in</b> the outer retinal layers of the external limiting membrane (ELM) at the fovea and the photoreceptor integrity and VA. : SD-OCT showed that 58 eyes (53. 7 %) had hyperreflective <b>foci</b> <b>in</b> the outer retinal layers, and 107 eyes (99. 1 %) had hyperreflective <b>foci</b> <b>in</b> the inner retinal layers.

5|$|Fielding's seventh play, Rape upon Rape; or, The Justice Caught in His Own Trap, was a five-act comedic {{play that}} first ran on 23 June 1730 at the Little Theatre for eight nights. The play enjoyed some success {{until it was}} renamed The Coffee-House Politician and was altered to {{possibly}} update the play as it focused on mocking current news events. The play is a love comedy that incorporates a corrupt judge that stands in the lovers' way. Eventually, various characters attempt to stop the judge, but he prevails albeit in a comedic fashion. Fielding's <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> the play is to point out corruption in government and to attack those who abuse their power.|$|E
5|$|In Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking, {{which was}} based on her {{doctoral}} research, Palmer explores the possibility of a process philosophy-inspired account of environmental ethics, focussing on the work of Alfred North Whitehead and Charles Hartshorne. She ultimately concludes that a process ethic is not a desirable approach to environmental questions, despite the fact that process thought has been co-opted by some environmentalist thinkers. In Animal Ethics in Context, Palmer asks about responsibilities to aid animals, in contrast to the typical <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> animal ethics on not harming animals. She defends a contextual, relational ethic according to which humans will typically have duties to assist only domestic, and not wild, animals in need. However, humans will often be permitted to assist wild animals, and may be obligated to do so if there is a particular (causal) relationship between humans and the animals' plight.|$|E

5|$|In modern times, the Giant Schnauzer {{is used as}} {{a police}} dog; is trained for obedience, dog agility, herding, search and rescue, and schutzhund; and is shown in {{conformation}} shows. They are also used for carting. In Europe, the breed is considered {{to be more of a}} working dog than a show dog. The <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> many European Schnauzer clubs is not so much on conformation shows, but on the working ability of the breed. In several countries, including Germany, dogs must achieve a Schutzhund Champion title before they can qualify to be a conformation champion.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{prosperity}} {{became a}} primary <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> healing revivals. T. L. Osborn began emphasizing prosperity in the 1960s and became {{known for his}} often ostentatious displays of personal wealth. During that decade, Roberts and William Branham criticized other prosperity ministries, arguing that their fund-raising tactics unfairly pressured attendees. These tactics were prompted {{in part by the}} expense of developing nationwide radio networks and campaign schedules. At the same time, leaders of the Pentecostal Assemblies of God denomination often criticized the focus on prosperity taken by independent healing evangelists.|$|E
5|$|Individuals {{living in}} large groups may be safer from attack because the {{predator}} may be {{confused by the}} large group size. As the group moves, the predator has greater difficulty targeting an individual prey animal. The zebra has been suggested by the zoologist Martin Stevens and his colleagues {{as an example of}} this. When stationary, a single zebra stands out because of its large size. To reduce the risk of attack, zebras often travel in herds. The striped patterns of all the zebras in the herd may confuse the predator, making it harder for the predator to <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> on an individual zebra. Furthermore, when moving rapidly, the zebra stripes create a confusing, flickering motion dazzle effect {{in the eye of the}} predator.|$|E

5|$|Little says Rosenberg was {{influenced}} by Erich Fromm, George Albee, and George Miller to adopt a community <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> his work, moving away from clinical psychological practice. The central ideas influencing this shift by Rosenberg were that: (1) individual mental health depends on the social structure of a community (Fromm), (2) therapists alone are unable to meet the psychological needs of a community (Albee), and (3) knowledge about human behavior will increase if psychology is freely given to the community (Miller).|$|E
5|$|Local {{influences}} {{have also}} been a strong part of Scouting. By adopting and modifying local ideologies, Scouting {{has been able to}} find acceptance {{in a wide variety of}} cultures. In the United States, Scouting uses images drawn from the U.S. frontier experience. This includes not only its selection of animal badges for Cub Scouts, but the underlying assumption that American native peoples are more closely connected with nature and therefore have special wilderness survival skills which can be used as part of the training program. By contrast, British Scouting makes use of imagery drawn from the Indian subcontinent, because that region was a significant <b>focus</b> <b>in</b> the early years of Scouting. Baden-Powell's personal experiences in India led him to adopt Rudyard Kipling's The Jungle Book as a major influence for the Cub Scouts; for example, the name used for the Cub Scout leader, Akela (whose name was also appropriated for the Webelos), is that of the leader of the wolf pack in the book.|$|E
