40|$|Abstract: <b>Intelligent</b> <b>power</b> quality <b>monitoring</b> {{systems have}} become an {{essential}} component of high technology and high availability-oriented industries. Most power quality disturbances are non-stationary and transitory and the detection and classification have proved to be very demanding. The first step towards any solution for a disturbance is to recognize the presence of a particular type of disturbance. This research automates this process where the design and implementation of a power quality disturbance classifier in FPGA is presented. The disturbances of interest include sag, swell, transient, fluctuation, interruption and normal waveform. The approach combines new intelligent system technologies using wavelet transform, artificial neural networks and fuzzy logic and provides some unique advantages regarding fault analysis. The approach developed in VHDL obtained a classification accuracy of 98. 17 %. The implementation of the project on Altera APEX EP 20 K 200 EBC 652 - 1 X FPGA utilized 1209 logic cells and achieved a maximum frequency of 263. 71 MHz.

40|$|Obtaining {{high quality}} {{information}} economically and reliably {{is always a}} difficult objective to achieve. The electric power industry and consumers recently face many challenges, such as deregulation, autonomous power systems and power quality. The knowledge {{of the nature and}} state of the power systems will undoubtedly be the key in meeting these challenges. The Non-Intrusive <b>Power</b> <b>Monitor</b> is a novel attempt to collect such information with a minimal physical installation. Raw voltage and current are measured at a single location to yield harmonic power signals. They typically carry the fingerprints of the electric loads present in a system, and their analysis can produce such information as the operational and diagnostic status of the loads. The power signals can also be used for the system identification, parameter estimation and energy consumption optimization study. In this research, the power signals are mostly modeled as stochastic processes and various detection, estimation and pattern recognition algorithms are developed to extract desired information. A constant load status identifier is developed in this thesis which can identify the ON and OFF status of electric loads, both from their steady-state power consumptions and transient patterns. The identifier can also classify multiple load events occurring at a same time and estimate states without load events. The power consumed by a variable speed drive is also estimated using the correlations between the fundamental powers and higher harmonic powers. The harmonic signal generated by the imbalance of a rotating machine is estimated to monitor the drive, i. e. its speed and magnitude of the imbalance. The algorithms are thoroughly tested using the data collected at real buildings, {{and some of them are}} implemented on-line. (cont.)

Physiological signals of humans such as heartbeats, temperature and pulse can be monitored from a distant location using tiny biomedical wireless sensors. Hence, it is highly essential to combine the ubiquitous computing with mobile health technology using wireless sensors and smart phones to monitor the well-being of chronic patients such as cardiac, Parkinson and epilepsy patients. Since physiological data of a patient are highly sensitive, maintaining its confidentiality is highly essential. Hence, security is a vital research issue in mobile health (mHealth) applications, especially if a patient has an embarrassing disease. In this paper a three tier security architecture for the mHealth application is proposed, in which light weight data confidentiality and authentication protocols are proposed to maintain the privacy of a patient. Moreover, considering the energy and hardware constraints of the wireless body sensors, low complexity data confidential and authentication schemes are designed.

This paper advocates statistical inference methods to robustify <b>power</b> <b>monitoring</b> tasks against the outlier effects owing to faulty readings and malicious attacks, as well as against missing data due to privacy concerns and communication errors. In this context, a novel load cleansing and imputation scheme is developed leveraging the low intrinsic-dimensionality of spatiotemporal load profiles and the sparse nature of “bad data. ” A robust estimator based on principal components pursuit (PCP) is adopted, which effects a twofold sparsity-promoting regularization through an ℓ 1 -norm of the outliers, and the nuclear norm of the nominal load profiles. After recasting the non-separable nuclear norm into a form amenable to distributed optimization, a distributed (D-) PCP algorithm is developed {{to carry out the}} imputation and cleansing tasks using a network of interconnected smart meters.
