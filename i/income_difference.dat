40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{barriers}} to the diffusion of development across countries over the very long run. We find that genetic distance, a measure associated {{with the amount of}} time elapsed since two populations' last common ancestors, bears a statistically and economically significant correlation with pairwise <b>income</b> <b>differences,</b> even when controlling for various measures of geographical isolation, and other cultural, climatic and historical difference measures. These results hold not only for contemporary <b>income</b> <b>differences,</b> but also for <b>income</b> <b>differences</b> measured since 1500 and for <b>income</b> <b>differences</b> within Europe. We uncover similar patterns of coefficients for the proximate determinants of <b>income</b> <b>differences,</b> particularly for differences in human capital and institutions. The paper discusses the economic mechanisms that are consistent with these facts. We present a framework in which differences in human characteristics transmitted across generations [...] including culturally transmitted characteristics [...] can affect <b>income</b> <b>differences</b> by creating barriers to the diffusion of innovations, even when they have no direct effect on productivity. The empirical evidence over time and space is consistent with this "barriers" interpretation. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{provides}} a framework relating the vertical transmission of characteristics across generations- such as the transmission of culture, language, norms and values- to <b>differences</b> in <b>income</b> per capita across countries. We propose a novel way to measure cultural barriers using genetic distance, i. e. coancestor coefficients from population genetics. Our econometric methodology addresses the problem of spatial correlation inherent in having pairwise <b>income</b> <b>differences</b> as our dependent variable. We find a significant effect of genetic distance on <b>income</b> <b>differences,</b> even when controlling for geographical distance, differences in latitude, and other cultural and geographic distance measures. These results hold not only for contemporary <b>income</b> <b>differences,</b> but also for <b>income</b> <b>differences</b> measured as of 1500 and 1700.

I also study variants of the model with endogenous and exogenous barriers to accumulation of technology capital, which consists of intangible capital and a fraction of physical capital that embodies technology. The addition of endogenous barriers, for reasonable parameter values, has a very small positive effect on the ability of the model to account for <b>income</b> <b>differences.</b> The addition of exogenous barriers suggests that huge cross-country differences in such barriers are needed to generate the observed <b>income</b> <b>differences...</b>|$|R
40|$|China’s {{rapid and}} uneven growth since 1978 has not {{eliminated}} but even re- inforced the persistent income inequality across provinces. While existing literature focuses {{mainly on the}} provincial variation in growth performance using cross-province growth regressions or growth accounting, few efforts {{has been made to}} directly study the <b>differences</b> in <b>income</b> levels across provinces. This paper explores the proximate causes of cross-province <b>income</b> <b>differences</b> in the framework of development accounting. Rather than assuming a priori values for output elasticities of capital and labor, we estimate them from an aggregate production function using panel data. The accounting results show that differences in total factor productivity (TFP) and in physical capital intensity are both important sources of cross-province <b>income</b> <b>differences,</b> each accounting for roughly half of the variation of <b>income</b> levels. <b>Differences</b> in human capital accumulation explain only a small amount of <b>income</b> <b>differences</b> across provinces. The results are robust {{to whether or not the}} assumption of constant returns to scale is imposed, and are valid in the long run.

50|$|Relative {{deprivation}} theory {{states that}} {{awareness of the}} <b>income</b> <b>difference</b> between neighbors or other households in the migrant-sending community {{is an important factor}} in migration. The incentive to migrate is a lot higher in areas that have a high level of economic inequality. In the short run, remittances may increase inequality, but in the long run, they may actually decrease it. There are two stages of migration for a worker: first, they invest in human capital formation, and then they try to capitalize on their investments. In this way, successful migrants may use their new capital to provide for better schooling for their children and better homes for their families. Successful high-skilled emigrants may serve as an example for neighbors and potential migrants who hope to achieve that level of success.|$|E

40|$|This is {{the author}} {{accepted}} manuscript. The final version is available from Taylor & Francis via [URL] article explores the association between intergenerational social mobility and attitudes towards <b>income</b> <b>differences</b> in post-socialist societies.

The described hypotheses are tested with two cross-national data sets – European Values Studies and Life in Transition Survey. The derived findings are robust to alternative statistical specifications and indicate that individuals who perceive themselves as subjectively mobile have significantly different attitudes towards <b>income</b> <b>differences</b> in comparison to non-mobile groups, but that this effect does not manifest among objectively mobile individuals...|$|R

Thus, while the postwar era has seen increasing trade and conditional convergence, the causality is bi-directional: convergence causes trade, and trade causes convergence.

Comecon realized disproportionately more political than economic gains from its heavy contributions to these three countries' underdeveloped economies.
