5|$|The {{attack on}} the gap began at 7:30am on 11 August, as a flight of Savioa-Marchetti SM.81 medium bombers {{attacked}} British defenders on Punjab Ridge. This half-hour assault {{was followed by a}} long artillery bombardment lasting until noon. At 12:30, the infantry attack began. II Brigade began moving slowly towards the Indians through the trackless wilderness north of the road, XIV Brigade attacked Mill, <b>Knobbly,</b> and Observation Hills, and XV Brigade clambered atop Punjab Ridge, engaging its defenders. The attacks of XIV Brigade against the Rhodesians failed, but XV Brigade managed to drive off the Indian defenders of Punjab Ridge. Counterattacks were mounted against the Italians, but these were unsuccessful. The Italian {{attack on the}} hills was renewed the next day, 12 August. Black, <b>Knobbly,</b> and Mill Hills were {{on the receiving end of}} repeated assaults by XIV Brigade, and the weakest of them, Mill Hill, began to reel under the sustained pressure. By 4:00pm, the British defenses were being overrun, and after nightfall the British retreated from the Hill, spiking their guns as they left.|$|E
5|$|The British had {{determined}} the Tug Argan gap {{the best possible}} place to make a stand out of the three roadways, and also the most likely invasion route, and thus positioned {{the bulk of the}} army around it. On the British right, to the north of Tug Argan, were three companies of the 3/15 Punjab Regiment, set upon a group of west-facing strongpoints overlooking the rough wilderness that lay beside the road. South of them lay the gap itself, manned by a contingent of Rhodesian troops. They sat upon a line of small hills, named from north to south Black, <b>Knobbly,</b> Mill, Observation, and Castle Hills. These hills, positioned in a row with 2,000–2,500 yard gaps in between, housed machine-gun nests surrounded with light rings of barbed wire and served as the Rhodesians' defensive strongholds and the main defense for the British of the pass. On the British left were another group of Indian troops, located upon the aptly named 'Punjab Ridge' facing directly to the south. Unfortunately for the British, the front was too wide for the troops available, and the gaps between hills too large, leaving the defenses prone to infiltration. Also, due to the hills being in a single line, the position lacked depth. Meanwhile, De Simone, arriving {{at the site of the}} impending battle on 10 August, set his forces directly opposite the British positions. On the left, II Brigade prepared to advance through the wilderness towards the Punjab troops in the north. In the Italian center, XIV Brigade faced the Rhodesian hilltop positions within the pass, and XV Brigade looked north towards Punjab Ridge on the Italian right. Behind them were XIII Brigade and the armored vehicles.|$|E

25|$|Threlkeld Knotts (meaning: the <b>knobbly</b> hill above Threlkeld) is a lower, rounded hill, {{nestling}} {{against and}} {{overshadowed by the}} steep northern face of Clough Head. Its curving summit ridge contains three small tops, {{each of which is}} marked by a cairn. From Threlkeld Knotts there is a striking view of Red Screes just above, and a narrow path slants up through the crags to the west shoulder of Clough Head.|$|E
500|$|The genus name Crocodylus {{comes from}} the Greek kroko which means a pebble and deilos, a worm or man, {{referring}} to the <b>knobbly</b> appearance of the dorsal surface of the reptile. The specific epithet novaeguineae is from the Latin and means [...] "of New Guinea". Other common names for this crocodile include New Guinea freshwater crocodile, Singapore large grain, Puk Puk, Buaya air tawar and Wahne huala.|$|E
500|$|Ergonomics {{and ride}} were also praised by Gavin Green in CAR August 1992: [...] "you sit {{straight}} ahead, pedals and four-spoked Nardi wheel beautifully positioned. [...] There's {{none of the}} askew nonsense that plagues Italian supercars...forward visibility is panoramic and side vision is good. [...] Rear vision is better than on some other mid-engined monsters." [...] He went on to describe the ride: [...] "The XJ220 rides over <b>knobbly</b> tarmac with extraordinary dexterity...the big Jag rides urban blacktop better than many sports saloons, never mind supercars." ...|$|E
500|$|At the {{posterior}} {{end of this}} spermaceti complex is the frontal sac, which covers the concave surface of the cranium. [...] The posterior wall of the frontal sac is covered with fluid–filled knobs, which are about 4–13 mm in diameter and separated by narrow grooves. [...] The anterior wall is smooth. The <b>knobbly</b> surface reflects sound waves that come through the spermaceti organ from the phonic lips. The grooves between the knobs trap a film of air that is consistent whatever the orientation or depth of the whale, making it an excellent sound mirror.|$|E
500|$|The {{humpback}} whale (Megaptera novaeangliae) is {{a species of}} baleen whale. One of the larger rorqual species, adults range in length from [...] and weigh about [...] The humpback has a distinctive body shape, with long pectoral fins and a <b>knobbly</b> head. It is known for breaching and other distinctive surface behaviors, making it popular with whale watchers. Males produce a complex song lasting 10 to 20 minutes, which they repeat {{for hours at a}} time. Its purpose is not clear, though it may have a role in mating.|$|E

2500|$|Lister Cars {{announced}} the build {{and sale of}} the Lister <b>Knobbly</b> Stirling Moss at the Royal Automobile Club in London in June 2016. The car is built to the exact specification of the 1958 model, {{and is the only}} magnesium-bodied car in the world, and the only car in history endorsed by [...] Moss. Brian Lister invited Moss to drive for Lister on three separate occasions, at Goodwood in 1954, Silverstone in 1958 and at Sebring in 1959, and to celebrate these races, 10 special edition lightweight Lister <b>Knobbly</b> cars are being built. The company announced that the cars will be available for both road and race use, and Moss will personally be handing over each car.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from recent}} {{alluvial}} deposits, the other main {{rock in the}} valley is Hauturu Sandstone, which is mid to late Whaingaroan, about 30 million years old.

2500|$|Threlkeld Knotts {{was first}} {{recorded}} by the Ordnance Survey in 1900. Knott is a dialect word from the Old Norse knǫttr, 'ball, hard round mass' used of compact or craggy hills. Hence Threlkeld Knotts is [...] "the <b>knobbly</b> hill above Threlkeld", a place-name recorded from as early as 1197 and meaning [...] "the slaves' spring" [...] from the Old Norse þræla, 'thrall, slave,' and Old Norse kelda, 'a spring.' 'Thrall' {{may have been the}} word used by the Norse settlers to refer to the native Britons.|$|E
2500|$|Internally {{the penis}} of Deroceras panormitanum has two side pockets (penial caecum and penial lobe), as in Deroceras invadens but unlike in Deroceras golcheri or related forms on Sicily. However, in Deroceras panormitanum the caecum is more {{tapering}} and pointed than in Deroceras invadens and the lobe may appear reduced or missing. [...] Also unlike in Deroceras invadens, the penial glands are <b>knobbly</b> and attach {{closer to the}} caecum than to the lobe. And inside the penis, between the distal and proximal parts, is a small flap that is absent in other species.|$|E
2500|$|Wollemia nobilis is an {{evergreen}} tree reaching [...] tall. The bark is very distinctive, {{dark brown}} and <b>knobbly,</b> quoted as resembling Coco Pops breakfast cereal. The tree coppices readily, and most specimens are multiple-trunked or appear as clumps of trunks thought {{to derive from}} old coppice growth, with some consisting of up to 100 stems of differing sizes. The branching is unique in that nearly all the side branches never have further branching. After a few years, each branch either terminates in a cone (either male or female) or ceases growth. After this, or when the cone becomes mature, the branch dies. New branches then arise from dormant buds on the main trunk. Rarely, a side branch will turn erect and develop into a secondary trunk, which then bears {{a new set of}} side branches.|$|E

60|$|The {{news that}} an open rupture had {{occurred}} between the Generals {{of the two}} invading armies was not slow in circulating. The early editions of the evening papers were full of it. A symposium of the opinions of Dr. Emil Reich, Dr. Saleeby, Sandow, Mr. Chiozza Money, and Lady Grove was hastily collected. Young men with <b>knobbly</b> and bulging foreheads were turned on by their editors to write character-sketches of the two generals. All was stir and activity.|$|E
6000|$|How quaint they were, those home-made rooms! They {{rise out}} of the shadows and shape {{themselves}} again before my eyes. I see the <b>knobbly</b> sofa; the easy-chairs that might have been designed by the Grand Inquisitor himself; the dented settle that was a bed by night; the few blue plates, purchased in the slums off Wardour Street; the enamelled stool to which one always stuck; the mirror framed in silk; the two Japanese fans crossed beneath each cheap engraving; the piano cloth embroidered in peacock's feathers by Annie's sister; the tea-cloth worked by Cousin Jenny. We dreamt, sitting on those egg-boxes--for we were young ladies and gentlemen with artistic taste--of the days when we would eat in Chippendale dining-rooms; sip our coffee in Louis Quatorze drawing-rooms; and be happy. Well, we have got on, some of us, since then, as Mr. Bumpus used to say; and I notice, when on visits, that some of us have contrived so that we do sit on Chippendale chairs, at Sheraton dining-tables, and are warmed from Adam's fireplaces; but, ah me, where are the dreams, the hopes, the enthusiasms that clung like the scent of a March morning about those gim-crack second floors? In the dustbin, I fear, with the cretonne-covered egg-boxes and the penny fans. Fate is so terribly even-handed. As she gives she ever takes away. She flung us a few shillings and hope, where now she doles us out pounds and fears. Why did not we know how happy we were, sitting crowned with sweet conceit upon our egg-box thrones? ...|$|E
