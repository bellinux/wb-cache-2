5|$|A team {{of doctors}} and {{surgeons}} at the Fifteenth Scottish Hospital in Cairo worked extensively on Smith, putting his jaw back together with a complicated assembly of bandage, plaster, nuts, bolts and wire, and rebuilt his face through skin grafts and other reconstructive surgery. In March 1944, after about five months' convalescence, he was passed fit <b>for</b> <b>flying.</b> He turned down the offer of a posting home to Southern Rhodesia as an instructor and, after a refresher course in Egypt, travelled to Corsica to rejoin No. 237 Squadron, which was by now flying Spitfire Mk IXs.|$|E
5|$|After {{the end of}} the campaign, Galland {{claimed to}} be {{suffering}} from rheumatism and therefore unfit <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> in open-cockpit aircraft, such as the Hs 123. He tactfully suggested a transfer to a single-engine aircraft type with a closed cockpit would improve his condition. His request was accepted on medical grounds. Galland was removed from his post as a direct ground support pilot. Galland never explained whether open cockpits had caused the complaint or some other cause; given his performance with eye specialists, a certain amount of suspicion is reasonable. He was transferred to Jagdgeschwader 27 (JG 27—Fighter Wing 27) on 10 February 1940 as the adjutant, restricting him from flying.|$|E
5|$|Aviation {{interests}} {{have their own}} set of weather maps. One type of map shows where VFR (visual flight rules) are in effect and where IFR (instrument flight rules) are in effect. Weather depiction plots show ceiling height (level where {{at least half the}} sky is covered with clouds) in hundreds of feet, present weather, and cloud cover. Icing maps depict areas where icing can be a hazard <b>for</b> <b>flying.</b> Aviation-related maps also show areas of turbulence.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s and 1930s {{the only}} fully trained crews were pilots, other crew members being volunteers from skilled ground trades who {{underwent}} short courses in gunnery and bomb aiming. Pilots {{were responsible for}} navigation, and when accurate navigation was essential, a second pilot was carried. Early in 1936 the Air Navigation School had been formed at RAF Manston to take over this training for all pilots destined for Coastal and Bomber Commands. Conversion training <b>for</b> <b>Flying</b> Boats was also given there.|$|E
5|$|Goble was {{accepted}} <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> training with the Royal Naval Air Service (RNAS) in July 1915. After graduating as a flight sub-lieutenant on 20 October 1915, {{he became a}} test pilot and undertook anti-submarine patrols out of Dover. Goble commenced operations with only three hours solo flying experience. Towards {{the end of the}} year he was posted across the Channel to Dunkirk, flying Caudron reconnaissance-bombers and Sopwith Pup fighters.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, he was {{selected}} <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> training with the Royal Australian Air Force at RAAF Point Cook, after which he transferred to the RAF, being granted a short service commission as a pilot officer on 21 August 1936. Posted to No. 15 Bomber Squadron, he was appointed adjutant of No. 90 Squadron in March 1937, flying Bristol Blenheim bombers. He received a promotion to flying officer on 21 May 1938.|$|E

5|$|King {{transferred}} to the Australian Flying Corps (AFC) on 13January 1917, and was posted to Britain to join No.4 Squadron AFC (also referred to as No.71 (Australian) Squadron, Royal Flying Corps, by the British) as an air mechanic on 18April. He was assigned to a training squadron <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> instruction in August. On 15October, he gained his wings and officer's commission. Allocated to No.4 Squadron in November 1917, King was posted to France for active duty on 21March 1918. The same day, the Germans launched Operation Michael, the opening phase of the Spring Offensive.|$|E
5|$|Malley took {{temporary}} {{command of}} No.4 Squadron {{at the end}} of June 1918, overseeing its move from Clairmarais North to a new airfield at Reclinghem. In August, he was posted to No.5 (Training) Squadron AFC at Minchinhampton, England. The squadron was part of the 1st Training Wing, led by Lieutenant Colonel Oswald Watt. Malley's rotation to home establishment was in accordance with Royal Air Force policy requiring pilots to be rested and serve as instructors after nine to twelve months in combat. Known <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> a white Camel trainer, he received the Air Force Cross for his instructional work; the award was promulgated on 3June 1919.|$|E
5|$|Mölders joined an {{infantry}} regiment of the Reichswehr in Allenstein, East Prussia on 1 April 1931. After {{completing his}} basic military training in October 1932, {{he transferred to}} the Military School Dresden. On 1 June 1933, he successfully completed his training in Dresden and was promoted to ensign. He again was transferred, this time to the 1st Prussian Pioneer Battalion (Infantry Regiment 2) at the Pioneer School in Munich. During his training years, Mölders made his first attempt to fulfil his dream of flying and volunteered for pilot training, but was declared unfit <b>for</b> <b>flying.</b> He tried again and was given conditional permission (bedingt tauglich—with constraints) to begin flight training.|$|E

5|$|Prinz zur Lippe-Weißenfeld in {{his younger}} years was very {{enthusiastic}} about the mountains and wildlife. From his fourteenth year he participated in hunting. At {{the same time he}} was also very much interested in music and sports and discovered his love <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> at the Gaisberg near Salzburg. Here he attended the glider flying school of the Austrian Aëro Club. He attended a basic flying course with the second air regiment in Graz and Wiener Neustadt even before he joined the military service.|$|E
5|$|The Bhutanese {{subsequently}} redesigned their flag {{to match}} the measurements of the flag of India, which they believed fluttered better than their own. Other modifications such as changing the red background color to orange led to the current design, in use since 1969. The National Assembly of Bhutan codified a code of conduct in 1972 to formalize the flag's design and establish protocol regarding acceptable flag sizes and conditions <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> the flag.|$|E
5|$|The Delhi Flying Club, {{established}} in 1928 with two de Havilland Moth aircraft named Delhi and Roshanara, was based at Safdarjung Airport which started operations in 1929, {{when it was}} the Delhi's only airport and the second in India. The airport functioned until 2001, however in January 2002 the government closed the airport <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> activities because of security concerns following the New York attacks in September 2001. Since then, the club only carries out aircraft maintenance courses and is used for helicopter rides to Indira Gandhi International Airport for VIP including {{the president and the}} prime minister.|$|E

5|$|The Law on the National Flag {{mentions}} five possible sizes {{that could}} be made for the national flag: According to Article 4 of the Law On the National Flag, people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions and municipalities directly under the Central Government are directed to authorize companies to make any copy of the national flag. Besides five official sizes <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> on flagpoles, there are another four smaller sizes for other purpose, such as decoration on cars or display in the meeting room.|$|E
5|$|The Operation Goodwood attack force sailed on 18 August. The {{timing of}} the {{operation}} was set to allow the Home Fleet to also protect Convoy JW 59, which had departed from Scotland on 15 August bound for the Soviet Union. After an uneventful journey north, the attack forces arrived off Norway on 20 August. While the first attack against Kaafjord had been planned to take place on 21 August, weather conditions that day were unsuitable <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> operations, and Moore decided upon a 24-hour postponement. The Germans were first alerted {{to the presence of}} the British fleet on 21 August when radio messages from the carriers were detected.|$|E
5|$|The government's {{contracts}} with the civilian organisations <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> instruction at Mascot and Newcastle were terminated during August 1940, and their aircraft—fifteen Tiger Moths and eight Gipsy Moths—were impressed by the RAAF. Airflite was engaged to provide maintenance. On 18November, an instructor was killed when he fell into a Randwick street from a Tiger Moth performing a slow roll after his safety harness broke; {{neither he nor his}} student, who though badly shaken was able to land the plane, were wearing parachutes. One Tiger Moth landed on top of another on 27December; both planes were badly damaged but no-one was killed.|$|E

5|$|Geilo Airport {{was opened}} in 1985 as a {{regional}} airport. On 20 June 1986, Coast Aero Center was awarded the concession <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> from Stavanger to Geilo Airport, Dagali until 1991. The airline used a Beechcraft 200 Super King Air on the service. At the same time, Norving started operations to Oslo. The ridership from Geilo {{turned out to be}} insufficient to make a profit, and both Coast Aero Center and Norving terminated their routes. Widerøe and Norsk Air said there was not enough ridership for them to be interested. In 1989, Coast Air received a one-year concession to operate from Geilo to Oslo and Stavanger. The company used de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. The service was soon limited to two round trips each week.|$|E
5|$|Isaacson {{grew up in}} Melbourne {{and started}} working for a {{newspaper}} when he was sixteen. He joined the RAAF in 1940. Following his stint in Bomber Command, he became well known in Australia for his tours in the Avro Lancaster Q-for-Queenie to promote the sale of war loans and, in particular, <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> his plane under the Sydney Harbour Bridge in 1943. He transferred to the RAAF Reserve after the war, retiring as a wing commander in 1969. From 1956 {{he served as a}} Trustee, Chairman, and finally Life Governor of the Victorian Shrine of Remembrance. In 1991 he was appointed a Member of the Order of Australia for his publishing and community work.|$|E
5|$|Leonard Victor (Len) Waters (20June 1924– 24August 1993) was {{the first}} Aboriginal Australian {{military}} aviator, {{and the only one}} to serve as a fighter pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) during World WarII. Aborigines at the time suffered significant discrimination and disadvantages in Australian society, such as restrictions on movement, residence, employment, and access to services and citizenship. Born in northern New South Wales and raised in Queensland, Waters was working as a shearer when he joined the RAAF in 1942. Training initially as a mechanic, he volunteered <b>for</b> <b>flying</b> duties and graduated as a sergeant pilot in 1944. He flew P-40 Kittyhawks in the South West Pacific theatre, where he completed 95 missions, mainly close air support. By {{the end of the war}} he had risen to the rank of warrant officer. Following his discharge from the RAAF in 1946, he attempted to start a regional airline but was unable to secure financial backing and government approval. He went back to shearing, and died in 1993 at the age of 69.|$|E
