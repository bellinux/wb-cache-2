500|$|The lead {{visual effects}} company was Weta Digital in Wellington, New Zealand, {{at one point}} {{employing}} 900 people {{to work on the}} film. Because of the huge amount of data which needed to be stored, cataloged and available for everybody involved, even {{on the other side of}} the world, a new cloud computing and <b>Digital</b> <b>Asset</b> <b>Management</b> (DAM) system named Gaia was created by Microsoft especially for Avatar, which allowed the crews to keep track of and coordinate all stages in the digital processing. To render Avatar, Weta used a [...] server farm making use of 4,000 Hewlett-Packard servers with 35,000 processor cores with 104 terabytes of RAM and three petabytes of network area storage running Ubuntu Linux, Grid Engine cluster manager, and 2 of the animation software and managers, Pixar's RenderMan and Pixar's Alfred queue management system. The render farm occupies the 193rd to 197th spots in the TOP500 list of the world's most powerful supercomputers. A new texturing and paint software system, called Mari, was developed by The Foundry in cooperation with Weta. Creating the Na'vi characters and the virtual world of Pandora required over a petabyte of digital storage, and each minute of the final footage for Avatar occupies 17.28 gigabytes of storage. Often, it would take each frame of the movie several hours to render. To help finish preparing the special effects sequences on time, a number of other companies were brought on board, including Industrial Light & Magic, which worked alongside Weta Digital to create the battle sequences. ILM was responsible for the visual effects for many of the film's specialized vehicles and devised a new way to make CGI explosions. Joe Letteri was the film's visual effects general supervisor.|$|E

40|$|Launching a {{successful}} digital repository {{takes more than}} selecting the right software and hiring the right staff. How do libraries know that they’re developing repository services that their users want? How do you lobby administration for the funding and staff needed for a new program? How do you ensure a digital initiative 2 ̆ 7 s success? OHSU Library’s DAM/IR Task Force share their experiences developing relationships, getting administrative support, and implementing a marketing and communications <b>digital</b> <b>assets</b> <b>management</b> system, which {{is now in the}} implementation phase. From the beginning of this process, the library took the opposite of the 2 ̆ 2 If we build they will come 2 ̆ 2 approach. This panel presentation focuses on how the OHSU Library built support for repository services by connecting with prospective users, and how the DAM/IR Task Force continues to involve users during implementation. Decisions around DAM implementation are not only informed by expertise in repositories management, digital library systems administration, and digital preservation, but also by stakeholder perspectives from across the OHSU campus. Panelists’ presentations emphasize the process, timeline, and methods for lobbying administration; advocating and communicating with IT departments; approaches to user-focused repository system selection, installation, and migration; and ensuring digital repository management best practices at the stakeholder level...|$|R
40|$|Digital {{content is}} a common {{denominator}} that underlies all discussions on scholarly communication, <b>digital</b> preservation, and <b>asset</b> <b>management.</b> This past decade has seen a distinctive evolution in thinking among stakeholders on how to assemble, care for, deliver, and ultimately preserve digital resources in a college and university environment. At first, institutional repositories promised both a technical infrastructure and a policy framework for the active management of scholarly publications. Now other approaches that take a broader view of digital content hold sway, the result being confusion rather than clarity about where digital content originates, who the stakeholders are, and how to establish and adjust <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> priorities. This article seeks to present a model for plotting the range of digital content that might be amenable to <b>management</b> as <b>digital</b> <b>assets</b> in higher education. The article reviews differing perspectives on digital content, outlines a generalized model, and suggests how the model {{could be used for}} examining the distribution of campus <b>digital</b> <b>assets</b> and fostering dialog on management priorities across stakeholder communities. A multivariate model of digital content provides a rich framework for analyzing <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> priorities in a university setting. The model should be applied and tested in a variety of university settings. The model is a tool for establishing <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> priorities across campus units that produce digital content.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the potential of}} a <b>digital</b> media <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> system to enable educational design and related work to proceed within a knowledge economy paradigm in a university setting. An action learning project at RMIT University in Melbourne during 1999 and 2000 took an institution-wide knowledge management approach to assess the feasibility of implementing a Web-database-driven system for managing {{a wide range of}} media objects used in teaching and learning and other core university operations. The project also assessed the implications of working with such a system for the professional practices of academics. The RMIT project canvassed the requirements of key stakeholders, worked out the major elements of system design, and built several iterations of a functional model for further testing. A media <b>asset</b> <b>management</b> system may help to resolve some serious issues associated with present patterns of use of educational media in diverse electronic formats.
