Modelling the loss stochastically, the cost of credit risk is the <b>expected</b> <b>loss.</b> In credit business {{the probability that the}} debtor will default in payments within one year, often is the only reliable quantitative parameter.

40|$|Abstract: When {{evaluating}} point estimators {{by means}} of general <b>loss</b> functions, the <b>expected</b> <b>loss</b> is not always minimal, similar {{to the case of}} mean-biased estimators, whose mean squared error can be reduced by accounting for the mean-bias. Depending on the loss function, the so-called Lehmann-bias can be significantly more important than the mean-bias of an estimator. Although a simple decomposition does not hold for <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> as it does for the mean squared error, the <b>expected</b> <b>loss</b> can still be reduced by correcting for the Lehmann-bias. An asymptotic and a bootstrap-based correction are suggested and compared in small samples for the exponential distribution {{by means of}} Monte Carlo simulation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new approach, {{based on the}} Merton model, to decomposing corporate bond spreads into the <b>expected</b> <b>loss,</b> bond risk premium and liquidity premium components. The approach focuses on establishing the bond risk premium using the equity risk premium and the hedge ratio, which are estimated using a dividend discount model and a BEKK-GARCH model. The analysis focuses on non-financial European BBB-rated corporate bonds and distinguishes explicitly between German, French, Spanish and Italian firms. The {{results show that the}} bond risk premium is the largest component. While the <b>expected</b> <b>loss</b> component made the greatest contribution to the strong widening of the spreads around the turn of 2008 / 09, the spreads were then heavily dominated by the bond risk premium and investors received relatively low or, at times, no compensation for <b>expected</b> <b>losses.</b> The safe interest rate and the sovereign CDS premiums are key determinants of the <b>expected</b> <b>loss</b> component and the bond risk premium...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The paper {{attempts}} {{to analyze the}} volatility of returns and <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> of Islamic bank financing. In particular, it takes the case of Indonesian Islamic banking industry. Design/methodology/approach – The paper uses Value at Risk (VaR) approach to compute the volatility (risk) of returns and <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> of Islamic bank financing. In particular, it uses variance-covariance method to calculate VaR of multi-asset portfolios (groups of equity-, debt- and service-based financing). Findings – First of all, equity and debt-based financing produce sustainable returns of bank financing. Moreover, they are also very resilient during unfavorable economic conditions. Second, the performance of service-based financing is very sensitive to the economic conditions. Lastly, VaR computation on the volatility of returns and <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> of bank financing finds that risk of investment and <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> are well managed. Practical implications – The paper demands Islamic banks to keep intensifying equity-based financing rather than only debt-based financing and improve the banking services to support the performance of service-based financing. Originality/value – To {{the best of the}} author's knowledge, this is the first paper to assist the volatility of returns and <b>expected</b> <b>losses</b> of the Islamic banking financing in Indonesian.
