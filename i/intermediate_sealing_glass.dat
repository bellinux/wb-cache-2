Copper-plated tungsten wire {{can be used to}} seal through borosilicate glass with a low coefficient of thermal expansion which is matched by tungsten. The tungsten is electrolytically copper plated and heated in hydrogen atmosphere to fill cracks in the tungsten and to get a proper surface to easily seal to glass. The borosilicate glass of usual laboratory glassware has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion than tungsten, thus it is necessary to use an <b>intermediate</b> <b>sealing</b> <b>glass</b> to get a stress-free seal.|$|E
40|$|A new {{protocol}} for fabrication of glass microchips is {{addressed in this}} research paper. Initially, the method {{involves the use of}} an uncured SU- 8 <b>intermediate</b> to <b>seal</b> two <b>glass</b> slides irreversibly as in conventional adhesive bonding-based approaches. Subsequently, an additional step removes the adhesive layer from the channels. This step relies on a selective development to remove the SU- 8 only inside the microchannel, generating glass-like surface properties as demonstrated by specific tests. Named sacrificial adhesive layer (SAB), the protocol meets the requirements of an ideal microfabrication technique such as throughput, relatively low cost, feasibility for ultra large-scale integration (ULSI), and high adhesion strength, supporting pressures on the order of 5 [*]MPa. Furthermore, SAB eliminates the use of high temperature, pressure, or potential, enabling the deposition of thin films for electrical or electrochemical experiments. Finally, the SAB protocol is an improvement on SU- 8 -based bondings described in the literature. Aspects such as substrate/resist adherence, formation of bubbles, and thermal stress were effectively solved by using simple and inexpensive alternatives...|$|R

Three different methods as, grinding the 8 YSZ coating prior to the sealing (fixture A), putting an interlayer glass on the 8 YSZ coating prior to the sealing (fixture B), and exerting an external compressive force of similar to 10. 28 kPa during the sealing (fixture C), {{have been used to}} improve the thermal cycle stability of the <b>sealing</b> <b>glass.</b> The fixture A (using the grinding method) and the fixture B (using the interlayer method) both show poor thermal cycle stability.

40|$|For {{reliable}} operation of planar solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC), long-term {{stability of the}} sealing materials, including gas tightness and bonding to the joined materials, is essential. Failures induced by thermal cycling, slight stack deformation or degradation of the sealing material can lead to leakages and undesired combustion of fuel gas, causing hot spots and severe damage of stacks or whole systems. Suitable partially crystallizing SOFC <b>sealing</b> <b>glasses</b> are presented and characterized {{in terms of their}} softening properties, viscosity, thermal expansion and crystallization behaviour. However, it is not sufficient to characterize these internal properties. For reliable long-term operation, structural changes of <b>sealing</b> <b>glasses</b> and particularly reactions between interconnector materials and <b>sealing</b> <b>glasses</b> have to be considered. Therefore model sealings are tested in dual atmospheres with applied voltage. The resistivities of these arrangements were monitored continuously and changes in the microstructure of the joints were investigated after testing. The results are discussed in terms of the devolution of resistivity of model sealings at high temperatures and the microstructures of the <b>sealing</b> <b>glasses</b> and the glass-to-metal interfaces.

In this paper, interface reactions between a <b>sealing</b> <b>glass</b> and a ferritic metal interconnect (SS 410) are tested under three different heat treatment conditions: sealing (static), aging (static), and thermal cycling (dynamic). The {{results show that the}} BaCrO 4 crystals with two different morphology (round-shaped and needle-shaped) form both at the three-phase boundary (where air, glass, and SS 410 meet) and {{on the surface of the}} <b>sealing</b> <b>glass</b> under the three conditions. Round-shaped BaCrO 4 crystals form with low O- 2 concentration and short reaction time. Needle-shaped BaCrO 4 crystals form with high O- 2 concentration and long reaction time. For the thermal cycling condition, the BaCrO 4 formed at early stages causes the delamination of the sealing interface. Then, O- 2 diffuses into the interior interface along the delamination path, which results in the formation of BaCrO 4 at the interior interface. The delaminationenhanced BaCrO 4 formation during thermal cycling will lead to crack along the sealing interface, causing the striking increase of leak rates...|$|R

It is found that the <b>sealing</b> <b>glass</b> interacts chemically with the SS 410 alloy and the formation of BaCrO 4 new phase results in the rapid increase of the leak rates.
