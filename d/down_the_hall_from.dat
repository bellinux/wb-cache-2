5|$|In late 1976, Bakshi {{learned that}} John Boorman was {{contracted}} to direct {{an adaptation of}} The Lord of the Rings, in which J. R. R. Tolkien's three-volume novel would be condensed into a single film. Bakshi arranged a meeting with Mike Medavoy, United Artists' head of production, who agreed to let Bakshi direct {{in exchange for the}} $3 million that had been spent on Boorman's screenplay. <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> Medavoy was Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer president Dan Melnick, who interrupted a meeting with Peter Bogdanovich when he learned that Bakshi wanted to discuss acquiring the rights to The Lord of the Rings. Melnick agreed to pay United Artists $3 million, but was soon fired; the project was canceled by his replacement, Dick Shepherd. Bakshi contacted Saul Zaentz, who wrote a check to cover MGM's debt and agreed to fund the $8 million budget for the first of what was initially planned as a series of three films, and later negotiated down to two. Before production began, Bakshi and Zaentz insisted that the Tolkien estate receive residuals from the film.|$|E
25|$|Cobb agreed, {{traveling}} to Cuba afterwards. Her duties in Havana included translating Castro's speeches and {{working as a}} public relations assistant. She also translated Castro's new land reform laws into English. She worked on the 18th floor, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> Castro's office. She and William Alexander Morgan were the only Americans to gain any sort of influence in the new regime.|$|E

His interests shifted to math and physics and he received an advanced education in mathematics and experimental physics at the Swiss Federal Polytechnic (today known as ETH Zurich), located in Zurich, Switzerland. In 1925, he emigrated to the United States to work with Robert Millikan at California Institute of Technology (Caltech) with an office <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> Robert Oppenheimer after receiving the [...] "international fellowship from the Rockefeller Foundation." ...|$|E

5000|$|<b>The</b> town <b>hall</b> {{was built}} in 1861 and 1862 on the same site as the old one from the 16th century which had burnt <b>down.</b> <b>The</b> first town <b>hall,</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> 14th century, is {{believed}} to have stood elsewhere.|$|R
50|$|Bolzern {{also used}} this {{software}} himself to continue accessing the system from his third-floor Lathrop Hall dorm room, via wires {{to the one}} phone for <b>the</b> entire floor, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> Also <b>from</b> anywhere else {{he happened to be}} with his Apple II and Hayes Modem, as well as to communicate with his family back home via email, and continued after graduation in 1981 with a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering. What Bolzern had created at UAF soon became used by university teachers and students for years thereafter.|$|R
2500|$|Recording for Is This What You Want? {{began at}} EMI Studios in London in June 1968 and {{continued}} through the summer in between Harrison's work on the Beatles' White Album. While working alone at Trident Studios, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> where the band were recording, Lomax was invited to add backing vocals to [...] "Dear Prudence" [...] in late August; he had also joined the backing chorus for [...] "Hey Jude" [...] earlier that month.

(Rufio and Britannus come <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> the loggia at {{opposite}} sides, past Caesar, who {{waits for a}} moment near the step {{to say to the}} soldier.)

Caesar comes down the hall between Rufio and Britannus) Rufio: we have some ships in the west harbor. Burn them.|$|E
60|$|Virginia sat upon a {{very hard}} {{horsehair}} chair in a barely furnished room, and waited. The table was covered with magazines, {{but she did not}} touch them. She sat nervously twisting and untwisting her fingers. Then the sudden sound of voices outside attracted her attention. The door of the room in which she sat had been left ajar, and apparently two men, passing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> a room on the other side, had paused just outside it.|$|E
50|$|It {{is alleged}} that the {{challenge}} was actually accepted in 1689 by an old woman, supposedly a noted Jacobite swordsman in disguise, who challenged the Dymoke {{of the day to}} combat next day in Hyde Park. There is no evidence to support this claim. Equally, rumour reported that in 1764 a lady's white kid glove fluttered <b>down</b> into <b>the</b> <b>Hall,</b> supposedly <b>from</b> a Jacobite.|$|R
40|$|On {{an early}} fall day in September 1962 I sat quietly, thoughtfully, at my large desk {{in a newly}} renovated corner office in the old Crane wing of the Lillie Building, Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL), Woods Hole, Massachusetts. Looking out through high, ancient windows, I could see the busy main street of Woods Hole in the foreground, Martha's Vineyard beyond, behind me the MBL Stone Candle House, across the street the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI) and to the far right, the Biological Laboratory of the Bureau of Commercial Fisheries (BCF) (Fig. 1). <b>Down</b> <b>the</b> inner <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> my office {{stretched}} renovated quarters for the fledgling, ongoing, year-round MBL Systematics-Ecology Program (SEP), which I {{had been invited to}} direct...|$|R
60|$|The {{opposite}} {{door opened}} and a light flooded <b>the</b> <b>hall.</b> <b>From</b> where <b>the</b> girl stood in the dark drawing-room she could see Miss Stearne standing in her doorway and listening. Mary Louise held herself motionless. She scarcely dared breathe. The principal glanced up and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall,</b> noted <b>the</b> locked doors and presently retired into her room, after a little while extinguishing the light.|$|R
6000|$|... "It wasn't so {{hard when}} I got fairly started," [...] said Cyrilla, smiling. [...] "Now, let's hunt up Nora Jane {{and send the}} letters around so that {{everybody}} can read his or hers before tea-time. We should have a choice assortment of smiles at the table instead of all those frowns and sighs we had at dinner." [...] Miss Emily Marshall {{was at that moment}} sitting in her little back room, all alone in the dusk, with the rain splashing drearily against the windowpanes outside. Miss Marshall was feeling as lonely and dreary as she looked--and as she had often felt in her life of sixty years. She told herself bitterly that she hadn't a friend in the world--not even one who cared enough for her to come and see her or write her a letter now and then. She thought her boarding-house acquaintances disliked her and she resented their dislike, without admitting to herself that her ungracious ways were responsible for it. She smiled sourly when little ripples of laughter came faintly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> the front room where The Trio were writing their letters and laughing over the fun they were putting into them.|$|E
6000|$|After prayers we {{had dinner}} in a great banqueting hall which was lighted by {{hundreds}} of grease-jets, and everything was as fine and lavish and rudely splendid as might become the royal degree of the hosts. At {{the head of the}} hall, on a dais, was the table of the king, queen, and their son, Prince Uwaine. Stretching <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> this, was the general table, on the floor. At this, above the salt, sat the visiting nobles and the grown members of their families, of both sexes,--the resident Court, in effect--sixty-one persons; below the salt sat minor officers of the household, with their principal subordinates: altogether a hundred and eighteen persons sitting, and about as many liveried servants standing behind their chairs, or serving in one capacity or another. It was a very fine show. In a gallery a band with cymbals, horns, harps, and other horrors, opened the proceedings with what seemed to be the crude first-draft or original agony of the wail known to later centuries as [...] "In the Sweet Bye and Bye." [...] It was new, and ought to have been rehearsed a little more. For some reason or other the queen had the composer hanged, after dinner.|$|E
50|$|Also {{during this}} time, Truitt earned a masterâ€™s degree in {{physical}} education from Ohio State in 1962. His office in St. John Arena was just <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> <b>from</b> the office of Woody Hayes, the longtime coach of the Ohio State Buckeyes football team.|$|E

5000|$|In {{the mid-1800s}} the Loyal Orange Institution, a protestant fraternal organization, had a {{group based in}} Shanly known collectively as the Loyal Orange Lodge No. 1227. The Orange Lodge {{constructed}} a hall in 1869, calling the building Dufferin Lodge. The two-storey frame structure consisted of an upper-level meeting hall and a lower-level drive shed. This hall was replaced in 1889, when new hall was constructed for their meetings in a new location. In 1949, the Orange Lodge tore <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>hall</b> after purchasing <b>the</b> Workmanâ€™s <b>Hall</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Shanly United Church (formerly the Wesleyan-Methodist), which was used for meeting into the 1990s.|$|R
