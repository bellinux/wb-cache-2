At the same time, he shared in the drafting of a proclamation giving Anabaptists and Sacramentaries ten <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> out of the country. In 1539 Parliament passed the Six Articles reaffirming Roman Catholic practices such as transubstantiation, clerical celibacy {{and the importance of}} confession to a priest and prescribed penalties if anyone denied them. Henry himself observed the Easter Triduum in that year with some display.|$|E
5|$|The {{initiative}} for a cross-fjord ferry services {{was taken by}} Arthur Selvig, leader of the merchants' association in Levanger. In January 1955, he invited members of the municipal councils {{on both sides of}} the fjord to establish a company. The meeting was held in Levanger, and the representatives from Mosvik took two <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to the meeting. An interim committee was appointed, which was to cooperate with Innherreds Aktie Dampskibsselskab to persuade them not purchase a new ship, and also to consider purchase of a combined car- and cargo-ferry, or alternatively a conventional vessel. At the time, National Road 755 between Mosvik and Leksvik was being constructed and would be competed by the end of the decade; however, it would take longer before Mosvik would be connected to Venneshamn. The committee suggested the route Venneshamn–Kjerringvik–Vangshylla–Ytterøy–Levanger be established. The municipal council of Ytterøy voted to place the ferry quay at Hokstad, which was serving as the municipal center.|$|E

25|$|It took Alexander three <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> {{everything}} {{ready for}} the general assault {{that was about to}} take place against the city. When things were finally ready, Alexander divided his force into three parts. The first part of the force he ordered to attack the palisades that were around the city itself. The second part formed a line of battle and faced the Theban infantry. The third part was a reserve, tasked with plugging up any holes and to press up any advantages that the Macedonians gained {{in the course of the}} siege.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, {{the group}} focused on {{working with the}} {{financial}} proposals which they expected {{to present to the}} organization that oversees the Games: the Central American and Caribbean Sports Organization (CASCO) in January 2009. By this point, the committee was planning meetings with popular representatives and had received moral support from the government. On 30 January 2009, CASCO gave the local organizers committee for the Games 60 <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> an estimated $20 million budget for the Games, or risk losing the hosting rights. The funds for the event were officially secured on 19 March 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{part of the}} {{expedition}} that took place over land took about 40–51 <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to San Diego. The contingent coming by sea encountered the south flowing California Current and strong head winds, and were still straggling in three months after they set sail. After their arduous journeys, {{most of the men}} aboard the ships were ill, chiefly from scurvy, and many had died. Out of a total of about 219 men who had left Baja California, little more than 100 survived. The survivors established the Presidio of San Diego on May 14, 1769. Mission San Diego de Alcala was established on July 16, 1769. As the first of the presidios and Spanish missions in California, they provided the base of operations for the Spanish colonization of Alta California (present-day California).|$|E

25|$|They were in {{the process}} of pulling back their forward units to the Green I fortifications of the Gothic Line proper and Kesselring was {{uncertain}} whether this was the start of a major offensive or just Eighth Army advancing to occupy vacated ground whilst the main Allied attack would come on the U.S. Fifth Army front towards Bologna. On 27 August, he was still expressing the view that the attack was a diversion and so would not commit reserves to the front. It was not until 28 August—when he saw a captured copy of Leese's order of the day to his army prior to the attack—that Kesselring realised that a major offensive was in progress, and three divisions of reinforcements were ordered from Bologna to the Adriatic front, still needing at least two <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into position.|$|E
25|$|Svenskhuset (the Swedish House) is {{the oldest}} house on Spitsbergen. The house was erected by the Swedes on Cape Thordsen in Isfjorden, and was {{intended}} to withstand the harsh conditions of the Svalbard winters. A group of Norwegian seal hunters were stuck on the island {{in the autumn of}} 1872. They sought out the Finland-Swedish explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld, who at the time was conducting an expedition in the area, for assistance. Nordenskiöld did not have the resources to accommodate all the hunters, so it was agreed that a number of the men would make their way to Svenskhuset, where they knew there would be food, coal and equipment. Seventeen men without families were selected, and on 14 October 1872 they set out for Svenskhuset in row boats. The journey was 350 km (220 mi), and it took the crew seven <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> to their destination.|$|E
25|$|Carts or floats {{are built}} by local clubs, which as local {{charities}} themselves are aimed specifically and solely at raising funds for other charities which operate within their locality. Clubs generate all funds required {{to build and}} operate their carts totally by charitable donations from individuals and sponsorship from local businesses— all funds raised during the carnival season are wholly distributed by the club charity. Some carts cost in excess of £20,000 to build and {{are the result of}} thousands of man-hours work throughout the year. Most clubs are based around local working or social circles, such as pubs and clubs. Many clubs have specialist Juvenile Carnival clubs for the under 16s. To join an adult 16 and over club, an initiation ceremony is often involved. All work is carried out in the spare time of the club members on a voluntary basis– often working all night in the final few <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> carts ready.|$|E

25|$|On 27 May, Joseph sent Clausel {{an order}} asking {{for him to}} return the {{divisions}} of Barbot, Foy and Taupin, if he was finished using them. At this time it might take eight to ten <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a courier through to Clausel's 15,000-man column. On 15 June, Clausel marched from Pamplona, heading for Logroño, hoping to join Joseph. From Logroño he turned northwest and reached Treviño on 22 June, completely unaware of the Battle of Vitoria the day before. At last, Clausel heard about the French defeat and his column marched south to Viana on 23 June. The next day he tried to go north to Salvatierra but turned around when he received reports {{of the magnitude of}} the Vitoria disaster. On 25 June Clausel picked up the garrison of Logroño and marched northeast toward Pamplona. But reports that the British were trying to intercept his column caused him to swerve south and cross the Ebro River at Lodosa on 26 June.|$|E
25|$|In {{the myth}} of Inanna's descent, Inanna, in order to console her grieving sister Ereshkigal, who is {{mourning}} {{the death of her}} husband Gugalana (gu, bull, gal, big, ana, sky/heaven), slain by Gilgamesh and Enkidu, sets out to visit her sister. She tells her servant Ninshubur (Lady Evening), a reference to Inanna's role as the evening star, that if she does not return in three <b>days,</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> help from her father Anu, Enlil, king of the gods, or Enki. When she does not return, Ninshubur approaches Anu only to be told that he understands that his daughter is strong and can take care of herself. Enlil tells Ninshubur he is much too busy running the cosmos. Enki immediately expresses concern and dispatches his Galla demons, Galaturra or Kurgarra, sexless beings created from the dirt from beneath the god's finger-nails, to recover the young goddess. These beings may be the origin of the Greco-Roman Galli, androgynous beings of the third sex, similar to the American Indian berdache, who played an important part in early religious ritual.|$|E
25|$|Before World War II, the Medal of Honor {{could be}} {{received}} for actions not involving direct combat {{with the enemy}} and 193 men earned the medal in this way. Most of these medals were presented {{to members of the}} United States Navy for rescuing or attempting to rescue someone from drowning. One of those awarded the Medal of Honor for rescuing others was Fireman Second Class Telesforo Trinidad, who as of 2010 has been the only Asian American Sailor to be awarded the Medal of Honor. In addition to the medals that were presented for lifesaving acts, one Medal of Honor was presented to William Halford who sailed in a small boat for 31 <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> help for {{the other members of the}} USS Saginaw who had been stranded on an island. Three explorers were also presented with the medal by special acts of Congress. Charles Lindbergh received the medal for flying the first solo non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean as well as Floyd Bennett and Richard Evelyn Byrd who received it for their participation in what was thought to be the first successful heavier-than-air flight to the North Pole and back. One recipient, Adolphus W. Greely received his for a lifetime of military service.|$|E

500|$|According to Wong, {{the idea}} of using a roller-coaster {{derailment}} as the opening-scene disaster came from New Line Cinema executive Richard Bryant and was not inspired by a Big Thunder Mountain Railroad incident. The idea of death omens in photographs was taken from The Omen (1976). Morgan revealed he searched the aisles of a local store at Sunset Boulevard for <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> inspiration regarding Erin's death at the hardware store. According to Morgan, the loss of control was a major theme that he and Wong had envisioned from the very beginning for the film; this is exemplified by both Wendy, who is afraid of losing control, as well as the roller coaster. He stated {{that one of the reasons}} people are afraid of roller coasters is because, according to psychologists, [...] " [...] have no control" [...] while on them.|$|E

With reference to their personal website, they state that their satisfaction remains with the many women they have helped and inspired and not so much with the success of book sales and viewing figures.|$|E
500|$|The soundtrack album {{has five}} songs set to tune by Harris Jayaraj {{apart from a}} theme music. The album marks the {{playback}} singing debut of Nakul, Andrea Jeremiah and Saindhavi. The first song to be composed was [...] "Kumari", a semi-classical folk melody sung by Shankar Mahadevan and Harini. [...] "Iyengaaru Veetu Azhage", written by Vairamuthu is a pure carnatic song sung by Hariharan and Harini. The track begins with [...] "Jagadananda Karaka", one of the Pancharatna Kritis by Saint Tyagaraja. [...] "Kadhal Yaanai", a peppy club song, was sung by G. V. Prakash Kumar and Nakul. Kumar, who would later turn a composer, {{was working as a}} keyboard programmer for Jayaraj when Shankar noticed him and made him sing. While Kumar had already sung a few songs as a kid under Rahman (his maternal uncle), this was his first song as an adult. Again, it was Shankar who recommended using Nakul's voice to Jayaraj. Nakul had earlier sung for the backing vocals of Shankar's Boys which also marked his acting debut. Na. Muthukumar's lyrics for the song predominantly contains Tanglish words interspersed among Tamil words. The music of [...] "Andangkaka", an aesthetic folk number, took three days to compose while the singers rehearsed for another five <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the words right. The lyrics by Vairamuthu is written in pure Tamil in a dialect spoken in the region surrounding Theni and Madurai districts of Tamil Nadu. The song was rendered by Jassie Gift, Shreya Ghoshal and Saindhavi. The song [...] "Lajjavathiye" [...] from the soundtrack of the Malayalam film 4 the People (2004) was composed and sung by Gift; it was a viral hit in Kerala. Jayaraj was impressed with him and made him sing, making it his first song in a Tamil film. The song also happens to be Saindhavi's maiden attempt at playback singing.|$|E
