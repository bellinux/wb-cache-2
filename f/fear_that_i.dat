500|$|The {{role of the}} Evil Queen/Regina went to Lana Parrilla. She {{explained}} the character, [...] "There's always two stories being told when playing Regina. There's the threat of her knowing she's an evil queen and then there's just the pure simple fact that the biological mother has stepped into her world {{and the threat of}} losing her son is just enormous. That's a <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> think any adopted mother would have. I think that's going to really help the audience relate to Regina in some level." [...] The role of Rumpelstiltskin was given to Robert Carlyle; it was written with Carlyle in mind, though the writers initially thought he would never accept the part. Horowitz recalled Carlyle's prison sequence, which was the actor's first day on the set as [...] "mind-blowing... You could see Ginny actually jump, the first time he did that character. It was fantastic!" [...] The writers offered the part of the Blue Fairy to recording artist Lady Gaga, but never heard back from her management staff.|$|E
500|$|Basu {{wanted to}} cast a new girl from Kolkata for the autistic character. Basu's wife, Tani {{suggested}} Chopra's name for the role. However, Basu feared that audience would see [...] "the Priyanka Chopra" [...] and not the character due to Chopra's stardom. Basu explained [...] "I had the <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would see Priyanka Chopra in the character and Jhilmil wouldn’t work. This has happened in many films where known faces have harmed the character." [...] Priyanka Chopra was cast to play the part but, the development was not announced as Basu wanted to workshop first {{and see how it}} goes. After three days of workshop, Basu was convinced that Chopra could play the autistic part and reflected that he was glad that he chose Chopra for the role. Later, Basu revealed that he did not approach any actress other than Chopra for the autistic part. After Chopra was cast in the film, Kaif left the project for unknown reasons. Media reported that she may have opted out of the film because Chopra had been given a stronger role. Later, media reported that Asin was approached {{to play the role of}} the narrator, replacing Kaif. However, Asin was never signed to the project. Media reported that no other actress wanted to sign for the film because according to them, the autistic part was stronger. In July 2010, Mumbai Mirror reported that Chopra was ready to play the role of narrator and leave the autistic role, so that another actress could be cast in the film; Chopra did not want the film to stall. Basu confirmed this development and said, [...] "It’s true we’ve been unable to cast the other part." [...] After facing several casting problems, Basu chose {{to cast a}} completely new fresh face to play the second female role. In early December 2010, Ileana D'Cruz from south Indian films, was finalised for the second female lead, featuring as narrator and Kapoor's first love interest in the film.|$|E

[...] Clinton's acknowledgment section began: [...] "It takes a village to bring a book into the world, as everyone who has written one knows. Many people have helped me to complete this one, sometimes without even knowing it. They are so numerous that I will not even attempt to acknowledge them individually, for <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> might leave one out." [...] During her promotional tour for the book, Clinton said, [...] "I actually wrote the book ... I had to write my own book because I want to stand by every word." [...] Clinton stated that Feinman assisted in interviews and did some editorial drafting of [...] "connecting paragraphs", while Clinton herself wrote the final manuscript in longhand.|$|E

He later remarked that [...] "I remember that what was generally happening was that everybody wanted to give me work, for <b>fear</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> would just be given other work by their rivals. So everybody was offering me things." [...] It was an era when comic books were increasing in popularity in Britain, and according to Lance Parkin, [...] "the British comics scene was cohering as never before, and {{it was clear that the}} audience was sticking with the title as they grew up. Comics were no longer just for very small boys: teenagers – even A-level and university students – were reading them now." ...|$|E
