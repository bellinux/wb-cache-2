40|$|A <b>foil</b> <b>switch</b> of plane {{configuration}} {{with low}} inductance and low resistance is described. An exploding aluminum foil drives the two switch electrodes together; the insulation is sheared and a metal-to-metal contact results. Clamp and start switching {{have been possible}} on circuits having a voltage up to 60 kV, a frequency up to 300 kHz and a current up to 2 MA. The delay is 3. 4 ± 0. 1 μsec for a 2 MA current rating and a 0. 4 mm polythene insulation; decreasing the current rating or the insulation thickness, decreases the delay too.

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} carried out to measure the dynamic cavity growth of dry sand during {{penetration}} by particulated jets from Viper 65 -mm-diameter, Cu-lined conical shaped charges at 1, 000 -mm standoff. The sand target was instrumented with <b>foil</b> <b>switches,</b> piezoelectric pins, and pressure transducers. Flash radiography at 450 -keV was used to characterize the jets before impact and to image the target hole during jet penetration. The authors have developed a dry sand equation of state based on existing Hugoniot data as input to a porous material model incorporated in the 2 -D arbitrary Lagrangian-Eulerian hydrocode CALE. They have carried out sand penetration simulations in which the particulated jet is modeled as hot copper rods. By varying parameters in the sand and copper descriptions they identify those features that affect the dynamic cavity formation...|$|R

40|$|AbstractComprehensive {{measurements}} of powder metal jet characteristics, namely the jet density and velocity profiles, {{have been obtained}} for a small size shaped charge widely used in the oilfield industry. The results are needed to examine existing penetration models, and to serve as benchmarks for numerical simulations. The jet flash x-ray and digitized images are recorded to measure the density profile, based on measured attenuation characteristics of the liner materials. Results show that density decreases from jet tail to tip, with a weak dependence on time. The {{results are consistent with}} previous findings for a similar charge. The jet velocity profile was determined by a series of time-of-arrival (TOA) experiments, using aluminum <b>foil</b> <b>switches</b> embedded in a limestone target. Results show that the jet velocity decreases linearly from tip to tail until the stagnation point. Finally, the measured jet density and velocity profile were applied to Tate-Alekseevskii penetration model to calculate jet penetration in limestone for which compressive strength is available. The calculated penetration time history fit the test data very well, while further work is needed to improve the agreement with penetration velocity...|$|R

40|$|An imaging {{bolometer}} is a {{new type}} bolometer which uses a large and thin gold foil which absorbs the incident radiation from the plasma and an IR camera to provide images of the temperature distribution within the foil which corresponds to the plasma radiation. Several theoretically predicted advantages of high temperature operation of an imaging bolometer, such are InSb sensors features, black body radiation intensity, noise equivalent power and others should increase the overall sensitivity. A series of experiments were made to prove this principle. The copper frame which supports the gold foil was heated by 4 vacuum compatible ceramic heaters up to 345 ºC. For simulating the local foil heating due to plasma radiation we used He-Ne laser. The laser beam was exposed on the foil only for several seconds for each frame temperature step. Also two thermocouples were {{used to measure the}} frame temperature. It was experimentally shown that the resulting sensitivity increases with the foil temperature. The sensitivity was measured as a weighted difference in mean signal intensity within a line crossing a laser beam point on the <b>foil</b> for <b>switched</b> off and switch on laser at different frame temperatures...|$|R
5000|$|Despite {{the sophistication}} of the concept, the {{mechanism}} of capacitive switching is physically simple. The movable part ends with a flat foam element {{about the size of}} an aspirin tablet, finished with aluminum <b>foil.</b> Opposite the <b>switch</b> is a PCB with the capacitor pads. When the key is pressed, the foil tightly clings {{to the surface of the}} PCB, forming a daisy chain of two capacitors between contact pads and itself separated with thin soldermask, and thus [...] "shorting" [...] the contact pads with an easily detectable drop of capacitive reactance between them. Usually this permits a pulse or pulse train to be sensed. Because the switch doesn't have an actual electrical contact, there is no debouncing necessary. The keys do not need to be fully pressed to be actuated, which enables some people to type faster.|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. This dissertation presents theoretical and experimental results from a research program that was aimed at finding practical ways of transferring energy to various loads, mainly from an inductive energy store fluxed by a primary store such as a capacitor bank. The main obj ecti ves of the work were to investigate and develop high power opening and closing switches, together with the transfer circuits needed to generate the fast (less than lOOns duration) high energy, pulses required in many applications. The study was to include a feasibility study {{of the use of}} the Plasma Erosion Opening Switch (PEOS) in such a system. To produce the large fast pulses required, an opening switch is required that: * Carry a current of the order of several kA during the inductor storage time. It should also be able to interrupt this current and to withstand the high voltage it will experience as the current is subsequently transferred to a load. * Conduct {{for as long as possible}} (up to one quarter period of the current waveform), to maximise the inductively stored energy which can be transferred to xhe load when the switch opens. * Open to an impedance that is large compared to the load impedance. This ensures that most of the inductively stored energy is transferred to the load. Open sufficiently rapidly to produce the required sharp pulse of voltage. In pulsed-power applications, energy is usually supplied from slow and relatively inexpensive power sources such as a capacitor bank, or an explosive flux-compression generator, which deliver large quantities of energy in the lO-lOO time range. Although no single switch is currently available which has such a long conduction time, together with a nanosecond opening time, the PEOS is a potential candidate. To overcome its short conduction time, while still obtaining an opening time of less than lOOns, the PEOS is used together with an additional slower stage or stages of switching. The key to this method is that each successive switching stage produces a considerably increased voltage. Various different types of switch were investigated and these are described in the thesis. Particular consideration is paid to the performance of the PEOS, as the final conditioning stage. Exploding foils are also investigated, together with a novel Automatic Exploding <b>Foil</b> Change-Over <b>Switch,</b> since an exploding <b>foil</b> opening <b>switch</b> is needed to condition the output of the capacitor bank before the PEOS. The initial resistance of the PEOS is very low, and the change-over switch is required to ensure that the current transfer takes place when the voltage across the fuse approaches its peak value. An important part of the investigation was to develop a mathematical model of the PEOS, as a part of the power condi tioning circuit, in order to simulate the system for different load conditions. The thesis explains the design, operation and performance characteristics of the various pulsed-power components, such as capacitor banks, closing and opening switches, pulse transformer, the vacuum system required for a PEOS, and high voltage and current measurement techniques...|$|R

40|$|Exploding foil {{initiators}} (EFIs) {{are highly}} {{suitable for use}} in inline fuze trains containing only secondary high explosives, mainly due to their insensitivity with respect to electromagnetic disturbances or mechanical stress, their precisely controllable fire characteristics and compact size. During EFI operation various multi-physical phenomena occur, such as high-volt <b>switching,</b> <b>foil</b> explosion, generation and acceleration of the flyer plate, as well as shock wave initiation of the explosive by flyer plate impact. In this work all the physical processes, including their coupling, are modelled using multi-physical models that neither employ complex finite elements computations nor experimentally determined fitting parameters. Implemented in a simulation tool, the complete EFI behaviour is covered, from firing (switching) to explosive initiation. Complementary experiments with test structures are conducted, analysing the electrical behaviour and the resulting flyer velocities of different EFI designs. Comparison with these experiments demonstrates {{the consistency of the}} simulations and sufficient accuracy. The validated simulation tool is used to determine all-fire/no-fire criteria, to improve geometries and materials and to analyse parasitic influences in the firing circuit. The paper shows that this model-based approach can be used to assess high reliability and safety either for existing or when developing new EFIs...|$|R
