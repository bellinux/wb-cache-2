500|$|On 21 May 1946, {{with seven}} colleagues watching, Slotin {{performed}} an experiment {{that involved the}} creation {{of one of the}} first steps of a fission reaction by placing two half-spheres of beryllium (a neutron reflector) around a [...] plutonium core. The experiment used the same [...] plutonium core that had irradiated Harry Daghlian, later called the [...] "demon core" [...] for its role in the two accidents. Slotin grasped the upper 9-inch beryllium hemisphere with his left hand through a thumb hole at the top while he maintained the separation of the half-spheres using the blade of a screwdriver with his right hand, having removed the shims normally used. Using a screwdriver was not a normal part of the <b>experimental</b> <b>protocol.</b>|$|E
500|$|Astrology has not {{demonstrated}} {{its effectiveness}} in controlled studies {{and has no}} scientific validity. Where it has made falsifiable predictions under controlled conditions, they have been falsified. One famous experiment included 28 astrologers who were asked to match over a hundred natal charts to psychological profiles generated by the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) questionnaire. The double-blind <b>experimental</b> <b>protocol</b> {{used in this study}} was agreed upon by a group of physicists and a group of astrologers nominated by the National Council for Geocosmic Research, who advised the experimenters, helped ensure that the test was fair and helped draw the central proposition of natal astrology to be tested. They also chose 26 out of the 28 astrologers for the tests (two more volunteered afterwards). The study, published in Nature in 1985, found that predictions based on natal astrology were no better than chance, and that the testing [...] "...clearly refutes the astrological hypothesis." ...|$|E

2500|$|British philosopher David Pearce defends what {{he calls}} physicalistic idealism (""Physicalistic idealism" [...] is the non-materialist physicalist claim that reality is {{fundamentally}} experiential and that the natural world is exhaustively described by the equations of physics and their solutions [...] "), and has conjectured that unitary conscious minds are physical states of quantum coherence (neuronal superpositions). This conjecture is, according to Pearce, amenable to falsification unlike most theories of consciousness, and Pearce has outlined an <b>experimental</b> <b>protocol</b> describing how the hypothesis could be tested.|$|E
2500|$|Experiences often {{associated}} with mystical reports such as out-of-body-experiences, intrusive thoughts, and the sensed presence were reported by hundreds of volunteers over decades of studying the phenomenon which were not associated with the subjects’ suggestibility. Subsequent theory and quantitative electroencephalographic measurements supported the contention that the sensed presence of a [...] "sentient being" [...] could be a normal brain-based prototype for god experiences or related mystical phenomena and was actually the left hemispheric awareness of the right hemispheric equivalent to the left hemispheric sense of self. Similar experiences were reported by people who had applied Todd Murphy’s technology. However other researchers either did not replicate or only partially replicated the experimental effects with variations of the helmet. In 2014, Tinoco and colleagues reported an independent replication of an <b>experimental</b> <b>protocol</b> which measured verbal behavior associated with field exposures using the helmet configuration.|$|E
2500|$|Although the <b>experimental</b> <b>protocol</b> had {{not been}} published, {{physicists}} in several countries attempted, and failed, to replicate the excess heat phenomenon. The first paper submitted to Nature reproducing excess heat, although it passed peer-review, was rejected because most similar experiments were negative {{and there were no}} theories that could explain a positive result; this paper was later accepted for publication by the journal Fusion Technology. Nathan Lewis, professor of chemistry at the California Institute of Technology, led one of the most ambitious validation efforts, trying many variations on the experiment without success, while CERN physicist Douglas R. O. Morrison said that [...] "essentially all" [...] attempts in Western Europe had failed. Even those reporting success had difficulty reproducing Fleischmann and Pons' results. On 10 April 1989, a group at Texas A University published results of excess heat and later that day a group at the Georgia Institute of Technology announced neutron production—the strongest replication announced up to that point due to the detection of neutrons and the reputation of the lab. On 12 April Pons was acclaimed at an ACS meeting. But Georgia Tech retracted their announcement on 13 April, explaining that their neutron detectors gave false positives when exposed to heat. Another attempt at independent replication, headed by Robert Huggins at Stanford University, which also reported early success with a light water control, became the only scientific support for cold fusion in 26 April US Congress hearings. But when he finally presented his results he reported an excess heat of only one degree celsius, a result that could be explained by chemical differences between heavy and light water in the presence of lithium. He had not tried to measure any radiation and his research was derided by scientists who saw it later. For the next six weeks, competing claims, counterclaims, and suggested explanations kept what was referred to as [...] "cold fusion" [...] or [...] "fusion confusion" [...] in the news.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Two {{important}} {{characteristics of}} science are the “reproducibility ” and “clarity”. By rigorous practices, scientists explore {{aspects of the}} world that they can reproduce under carefully controlled experimental conditions. The clarity, complementing reproducibility, provides unambiguous descriptions of results in a mechanical or mathematical form. Both pillars depend on well-structured and accurate descriptions of scientific practices, which are normally recorded in <b>experimental</b> <b>protocols,</b> scientific workflows, etc. Here we present SMART Protocols (SP), our ontology-based approach for representing <b>experimental</b> <b>protocols</b> and our contribution to clarity and reproducibility. SP delivers an unambiguous description of processes by means of which data is produced; by doing so, we argue, it facilitates reproducibility. Moreover, SP is thought to be part of e-science infrastructures. SP results from the analysis of 175 protocols; from this dataset, we extracted common elements. From our analysis, we identified document, workflow and domain-specific aspects in the representation of <b>experimental</b> <b>protocols.</b> The ontology is available a...|$|R
