40|$|Locking and {{unlocking}} {{operations are}} crucial to keep data consistency for concurrency control. Compared with traditional pessimistic locking method, the neutral concurrency control scheme can highly improve the concurrency of spatial database management systems. However, in consideration of spatial rules, <b>dead</b> <b>locks</b> brought about by waiting mutually for releasing required resources may frequently arise. To avoid such <b>dead</b> <b>locks,</b> referring to the theories of session management in operation system, we set forward an extended locking method for geographical database with spatial rules to implement the collaboration and competition between concurrent locking and unlocking transactions. The method avoids the expenditure of detecting <b>dead</b> <b>locks</b> and rolling back, and the system becomes more efficient. The test shows the extended locking technique makes the spatial database management system more ordered and efficient in a multi-users environment only with some time consumption of managing logical codes...|$|R

In addition, the queue mechanism within the extended locking method keeps the system in a good order.

40|$|Abstract: A {{challenging}} task in wireless {{sensor network}} (WSN) is to deliver authentic data between source nodes and sink nodes. The collision or <b>dead</b> <b>lock</b> occurs when two or more close nodes are attempted to send data {{at the same time}} to the others node. To avoid such <b>dead</b> <b>lock</b> situation in the network we propose a nonlinear mathematical model. The effect of nonlinearity often renders a periodic solution unstable for certain parametric choices even a very small change in initial conditions can lead to different result in chaotic systems which appears to exhibit chaos for a range of parametric values when long time behavior studied. The local stability conditions for the system have been discussed and analyzed. Numerically simulations have been carried out to study the complex behavior of the system for reasonable ranges of parameters in WSN...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Large-scale {{software}} systems achieve concurrency on enormous scales using {{a number}} of different design patterns. Many of these design patterns are based on pools of pre-existing and reusable threads that facilitate incoming service requests. Thread pools limit thread lifecycle overhead (thread creation and destruction) and resource thrashing (thread proliferation). Despite their potential for scalability, thread pools are hard to configure and test because of concurrency risks like synchro-nization errors and <b>dead</b> <b>lock,</b> and thread pool-specific risks like resource thrashing and thread leakage. Addressing these challenges requires a thorough understanding of the behaviour of the threads in the thread pool. We argue for a methodology to automatically identify and rank deviations in the behaviour of threads based on resource usage.

40|$|Abstract − Although a {{great deal}} of {{localization}} methods have been proposed, when it comes to human coexisting real world there are still many unsolved problems. It is because real world contains various kinds of uncertainties. For reliable navigation in such a world, this paper proposes a new localization synthesis integrated localization. The integrated localization is a dependable active localization approach, which is the structural synthesis of navigation modules. Due to a dynamic change of an environment, robot navigation cannot be solved by a single algorithm. In this paper, various situations are classified into different status, which is modelled as discrete events. Then, developed algorithms are synthesized in a structured way. The discrete event control structure enables efficient combination of position estimation algorithms and synthesis of navigation modules. Furthermore, the scheme provides structural framework for <b>dead</b> <b>lock</b> avoidance. The proposed technique is applied to KIST public service robots and shown to be useful in real experiments...|$|R

40|$|In {{time stamp}} {{ordering}} method, transactions (txns) access data by {{the order of}} timestamp. This makes concurrency control (CC) simple but decreases the degree of concurrency. On the other hand, standard locking grants locks on data items to txns by their request order. It increases concurrency but brings <b>dead</b> <b>lock.</b> In this paper, we propose a new approach called level ordered txn scheduler (LOTS), which can optimize txns execution order and maximize the degree of concurrency. Two links, D_Link and T_Link, are implemented in LOTS to support its internal quick computing. Each txn has a lever number (LNo). A txn can commit only when its LNo is 0. As shown in this paper, LOTS provides flexible control mechanisms on CC. And the depth of cascading aborts can be controlled. In the presence of heavy conflict frequency, LOTS has no system "thrashing". Performance analysis also shows that it's a promising CC with reasonable small overhead...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{we propose}} {{to study and}} analyze the tasks of a robot and the {{interaction}} with its environment, by using the power of Petri nets modelling, especially the timed nets. Our system consists of a robot, a programmable automaton and a computer. We consider {{the execution of the}} tasks taking into account the temporal constraints. So, we use the temporal Petri nets to model the whole system and also for its verification. We describe the obtained Petri net and the constraints textually or graphically in the environment TINA, an open source tool dedicated for timed Petri nets. We note that the Petri nets have good qualities of abstraction from the modelling point of view compared to the finite state machines which suffer from the states explosion problem, related to the accessibility graph. Moreover, the consideration of the temporal constraints adds an important complexity to the problem; the system which was carried out successfully in the case "without temporal constraints", can get in a <b>dead</b> <b>lock</b> state in the case "with temporal constraints " if these constraints are not satisfied...|$|R
