25|$|Danziger Bridge : It is a <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> {{with seven}} {{vehicular}} lanes (US Highway 90 / Chef Menteur Highway). When this bridge {{was completed in}} 1988, replacing a previous bridge of the same name, it was the widest <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> in the world.

50|$|After {{the return}} of the British, the Japanese-made girder bridge was {{replaced}} with two Bailey bridge extensions in February 1946, with the rubble of the demolished <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> cleared and the railway tracks re-laid. The lock channel and <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> were permanently closed as there was insufficient vessel traffic to justify its cost.|$|R
50|$|Lake City has {{the only}} <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> {{in the world}} that has been raised once in its {{construct}}ion. In order to construct a four-lane highway, a new bridge was constructed in 2002 and the <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> was moved to a location just south of the new bridge where it remains as a landmark.|$|R
50|$|Scherzer was the {{inventor}} of a refinement of the Bascule bridge called the Scherzer rolling <b>lift</b> <b>bridge.</b> His last engineering work before he died, done in 1893, was the design of two of these rolling <b>lift</b> <b>bridges</b> in Chicago. His design pivots the bridge like a rocking horse. The friction is lowered because it is rolling friction. Moreover when the bridge is open the channel is completely free as the mechanism has rolled away the bridge from the edge leaving the passage free for wide traffic. The first rolling <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> ever built was the Van Buren Street Bridge {{in the city of}} Chicago and was patented by Scherzer. The second rolling <b>lift</b> <b>bridge</b> constructed spanned the Chicago River between Jackson and Van Buren Streets. These bridge projects were for the Metropolitan West Side Elevated Railroad Company.|$|R
5000|$|The Portage <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge</b> connects Hancock and Houghton, Michigan, by {{crossing}} over Portage Lake, {{which is part}} of the river and canal system that crosses the entire peninsula. The Portage <b>Lift</b> <b>Bridge</b> is the world's heaviest and widest double-decked vertical <b>lift</b> <b>bridge.</b> Its center span [...] "lifts" [...] to provide 100 ft of clearance for ships. Since rail traffic was discontinued in the Keweenaw, the lower deck is used to accommodate snowmobile traffic in the winter. This is the only land based link between the north and south section of the Keweenaw peninsula, and is crucial.|$|R
