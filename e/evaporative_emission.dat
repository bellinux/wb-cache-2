40|$|A {{physical}} model simulating canister adsorption and desorption processes on activated carbon was developed from experimental {{data obtained from}} repeated tests on a single carbon canister. The model is able to predict canister behaviour under different loading and purging conditions and is thus able to predict canister breakthrough emissions. The {{physical model}} can accurately simulate butane adsorption and desorption on activated carbon. An empirical model was then developed, using simpler expressions for describing adsorption and desorption. Based on the empirical model a full <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> test procedure was simulated, enabling the calculation of <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> from canister-equipped vehicles. The fair agreement between measured and modelled emissions verifies that the empirical model {{may be used for}} the estimation of <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> from modern gasoline vehicles. For the calibration of the model extensive testing was conducted on one vehicle and for the final validation a smaller number of targeted tests were performed on other vehicles. These tests covered a wide range of parameters having an effect on <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions,</b> namely fuel volatility, ambient temperature, canister and fuel tank sizes, fuel system materials. The source of <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> depends largely on the canister condition. A well purged canister, e. g. after extensive driving on the road, results in effective adsorption of vapour generated in the fuel tank. <b>Evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> in this case may be attributed to fuel permeation and/or leakage rather than the canister. When the canister is close to saturation, breakthrough emissions dominate the total <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions.</b> The empirical model is applied {{for the development of a}} methodology for the calculation of <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> from a fleet of vehicles. The development of emission factors for various vehicle categories taking into account a large number of activity data facilitates emissions inventorying. ...|$|R

Approximately 28, 000 vehicles were monitored, corresponding to approximately 36 millionkilometres over a period of one month. The driving pattern of each vehicle was processed to derive the relation between trip length and parking duration, and the rate of occurrence of parking events against multiple evaporative cycles, defined {{on the basis of the}} type-approval test procedure as 12 -hour diurnal time windows.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{assesses the}} {{effectiveness}} of the <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> control systems of European passenger cars on the basis of real-world activity data. The study relies on two large datasets of driving patterns from conventional fuel vehicles collected by means of on-board GPS systems, consisting of 4. 5 million trips and parking events recorded by monitoring 28, 000 vehicles over one month. Real world <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> are estimated using a model that associates a carbon canister desorption event to each trip and a fuel vapour generation event to each parking. The mass of volatile organic compounds released into the air is calculated taking into account the hot-soak, permeation and breathing emission mechanisms. The analysis is based on 36 scenarios, defined by varying the climate conditions, the fuel vapour pressure, the tank material, the tank headspace volume, the purging volume flow rate and the mass of the activated carbon contained in the canister. The results show that in May 4 out of the 18 scenarios considered for Modena and 6 out of the 18 scenarios considered for Firenze lead to <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> values above the current type approval limit (i. e. 2 [g/day] per vehicle). In July, these numbers increase to 10 out of the 18 scenarios for Modena and to 12 out of the 18 scenarios for Firenze. Looking at the fleet distribution a share of approximately 20 % of the fleet is characterised by <b>evaporative</b> <b>emissions</b> higher than the limit in May, increasing to 48 % in July, with a peak value of 98 %. The emission peak value is estimated to be approximately 4 [g/day] in May and 8 [g/day] in July, while the time-dependent results show emission rates up to nearly 15 [g/s] in Modena and 30 [g/s] in Firenze, with a respective cumulative value in July up to 0. 4 and 0. 8 tons of VOCs per day. The space-dependent results show a value of the emissions in July of approximately 4 -to- 8 [kg/km 2 /day] in the city areas.
