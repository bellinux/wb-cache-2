40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to assess the rate of screw <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> in elderly patients treated with the dynamic hip screw and the relationship to the Tip Apex Distance (TAD). This is a retrospective radiological evaluation of 100 cases of elderly patients with intertrochanteric fracture treated with dynamic hip screw fixation surgically treated between 1998 and 2002. The incidence of screw <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> was assessed and correlation of risk of <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> with the TAD was assessed. The rate of screw <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> was 9. 0 % and the average length of time to screw <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> was 3. 8 months (range, 1 to 6 months) post-operatively. The incidence of screw <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> increased significantly when the TAD was 20 mm or more. The screw <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> rates were 2. 9 %, 20. 0 %, 30. 8 %, 50 % and 100 % fo...|$|R

25|$|The {{origin of}} the use of these <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> is not known. It may extend back to the pre Hispanic period, but there are now 16th century chronicles documenting the practice. It may have been a post Conquest invention, after the Spanish {{destroyed}} all other forms of representing the gods. It was easy to carry, mold, make and hide. Many of the religious concepts related to the <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> do have pre Hispanic roots. However, during the colonial period, the Otomi, especially of San Pablito were accused numerous times of witchcraft involving the use of <b>cut</b> <b>outs.</b> Today, some <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> figures are being reinterpreted and sold as handcraft products or folk art, and the use of industrial paper for ritual is common as well. <b>Cut</b> <b>outs</b> made for sale often relate to gods of agriculture, which are less called upon in ritual.

2500|$|While the Nahua {{paintings}} {{remain the}} most important craft form related to amate paper, the Otomi have adopted their elaborate <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> figures to the commercial market as well. This began with shamans creating booklets with miniature <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> of gods with handwritten explanations. Eventually, these began to sell and this success led to their commercialization in markets in Mexico City, were the Otomi connected with the Nahua in the 1960s. The Otomi still sell <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> in traditional designs, but have also experimented with newer designs, paper sizes, colors and types of paper. These <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> include depictions of various gods, especially those related to beans, coffee, corn, pineapples, tomatoes and rain. However, these <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> are not 100% authentic, with exact replicas still reserved to shamans for ritual purposes. Innovation has included the development of books, and <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> of suns, flowers, birds, abstract designs from traditional beadwork and even Valentine hearts with painted flowers. Most <b>cut</b> <b>outs</b> are made of one type of paper, then glued onto a contrasting background. Their sizes range from miniatures in booklets to sizes large enough to frame and hang like a painting. [...] The production and sale of these paper products have brought tourism to San Pablito, mostly from Hidalgo, Puebla and Mexico City, but some come from the far {{north and south of}} Mexico and even from abroad.|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} question {{was raised by}} M. Stillman. Main Question: Let C ⊂ P r = CP r be a smooth arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve which is <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> scheme theoretically by quadrics. Is the homogeneous ideal of C necessarily <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> by quadrics? In [4], it was shown that the question has an affirmative answer if r ≤ 5. The purpose of this note {{is to show that}} the question has a negative answer (there is a counterexample with r = 7). It is a pleasure to thank D. Eisenbud, M. Stillman, and C. Walter for helpful conversations. 1 Homogeneous and Scheme-Theoretic Generation by Quadrics Let X be a projective variety. It is often of interest to know whether or not the homogeneous ideal of X can be generated by quadrics, e. g. if X is a general canonical curve. In such a case, X is <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> scheme-theoretically by quadrics as well. It is usually easier to verify the scheme-theoretic statement — this amounts to ignoring the vertex of the affine cone over X. Problem: Let C ⊂ P r = CP r be a smooth curve which is <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> scheme theoretically by quadrics. Is the homogeneous ideal of C necessarily <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> by quadrics? In [4], this problem was investigated. The answer is a resounding no. A counterexample was found with r = 5. However, positive results were found. The problem has an affirmative answer for curves on scrolls, all curves with 1 r ≤ 4, and arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curves which lie on projectively normal K 3 surfaces <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> by quadrics (this includes all arithmetically C-M curves with r = 5). This leads to a more precise question, which we could not answer: Question: Let C ⊂ P r = CP r be a smooth arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay curve which is <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> scheme theoretically by quadrics. Is the homogeneous ideal of C necessarily <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> by quadrics? It turns out that this question also has a negative answer. Proposition 1 Let C ⊂ P 7 be a general degree 19 embedding of a general genus 12 curve over an algebraically closed field of characteristic 0. Then C is smooth and arithmetically Cohen-Macaulay, C is <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> scheme-theoretically by quadrics, and the homogeneous ideal of C is not <b>cut</b> <b>out</b> by quadrics. 2 Candidate...|$|R
