40|$|In the {{literature}} {{there are several}} reports dealing {{with the possibility of}} a <b>desensitising</b> <b>treatment</b> in food allergy, but there are very few studies about the immunological mechanisms of oral desensitisation. We studied the immunological modifications in four children who underwent oral desensitisation with cow milk. Four children with cow milk allergy underwent oral desensitisation according to a standardized protocol. Total IgE, eosinophilic cationic protein in serum, and specific IgE and IgG 4 to α-lactalbumin, to β-lactoglobulin and to casein were determined {{at the beginning of the}} treatment and after 6, 12 and 18 months in the 4 children treated. All the 4 treated patients successfully completed the treatment. Specific IgE to casein showed a significant reduction (p< 0. 01), while specific IgG 4 to α-lactalbumin (p< 0. 02), to β-lactoglobulin (p< 0. 01) and to casein (p< 0. 01) showed a significant increase. Total IgE, eosinophilic cationic protein, and specific IgE to α-lactalbumin and to β-lactoglobulin did not show any significant modification. Control patients did not show any immunological modification and still had a positive double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge. These results make us think that oral desensitisation in food allergy happens with the same mechanisms of traditional desensitising treatments for respiratory and insect sting allergies...|$|E
40|$|The long-acting β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist {{formoterol}} (10 − 10 – 10 − 6 M) inhibited the IgE-dependent {{release of}} histamine from human lung mast cells in a concentration-dependent manner. Formoterol was more potent {{and a full}} agonist relative to the nonselective β-adrenoceptor agonist isoprenaline. By contrast, the long-acting β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist salmeterol (10 − 10 – 10 − 6 M) was about two-thirds less efficacious than either formoterol or isoprenaline as an inhibitor of histamine release. Isoprenaline, formoterol and salmeterol (all at 10 − 5 M) increased total cell cAMP levels in mast cells over basal by 361 ± 90 (P 0. 05), respectively. Long-term (24 h) incubation of mast cells with formoterol (10 − 6 M) or salmeterol (10 − 6 M) essentially abolished the subsequent ability of isoprenaline to inhibit histamine release. Both formoterol and salmeterol were more effective at inducing the functional desensitisation than isoprenaline (10 − 6 M) or the short-acting β 2 -adrenoceptor agonist salbutamol (10 − 6 M). The desensitisation induced by long-term treatments with salmeterol and formoterol was specific for β 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated inhibition of histamine release as the inhibitory effects of alternative cAMP-elevating compounds, prostaglandin E 2, a receptor-mediated activator of adenylate cyclase, and forskolin, a direct activator of adenylate cyclase, were unaffected by <b>desensitising</b> <b>treatments.</b> Radioligand binding studies were performed to determine β 2 -adrenoceptor density in cell membranes after pretreatment (24 h) of cells with agonists. Isoprenaline, formoterol and salmeterol (all at 10 − 6 M) reduced β 2 -adrenoceptor density by 13 ± 5 (P> 0. 05), 49 ± 13 (P 0. 05), respectively. These data indicate that long-term exposure of mast cells to both salmeterol and formoterol can cause substantial levels of desensitisation to β 2 -adrenoceptor-mediated responses in mast cells...|$|R
40|$|Syphilis can seriously complicate {{pregnancy}} {{and result in}} spontaneous abortion, stillbirth, non-immune hydrops, intrauterine growth restriction, and perinatal death, as well as serious sequelae in liveborn infected children. While appropriate treatment of pregnant women often prevents such complications, the major deterrent has been inability to identify the infected women {{and get them to}} undergo treatment. Screening in the first trimester with non-treponemal tests such as rapid plasma reagin (RPR) or venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test combined with confirmation of reactive individuals with treponemal tests such as the fluorescent treponemal antibody absorption (FTA-ABS) assay is a cost effective strategy. Those at risk should be retested in the third trimester. Treatment during pregnancy should be with penicillin. In determining a penicillin regimen, the clinician must consider the stage of the maternal infection and the HIV status of the mother. Patients who are allergic to penicillin should be <b>desensitised</b> before <b>treatment.</b> Despite appropriate treatment, as many as 14 % will have a fetal death or deliver infected infants. Treatment may further be complicated by the Jarich–Herxheimer reaction, a complex allergic response to antigens released from dead micro-organisms, which can cause fetal distress and uterine contractions. Thanks to effective intervention strategies and inexpensive penicillin, syphilis rarely complicates pregnancy in the Western world today. In parts of the world where the traditional sexually transmitted diseases have not been controlled, the magnitude of problems associated with syphilis during pregnancy is reminiscent of that faced by the West during the early 1900 s...|$|R
40|$|Polymicrobial inter-kingdom biofilm infections {{represent}} a clinical management conundrum. The presence of co-isolation of bacteria and fungi complicates {{the ability to}} routinely administer single antimicrobial regimens, and synergy between the microorganisms influences infection severity. We therefore investigated the nosocomial pathogens Staphylococcus aureus and Candida albicans with respect to antimicrobial intervention. We characterised the interaction using biofilm assays and evaluated the effect of miconazole treatment using in vitro and in vivo assays. Finally, we assessed the impact of biofilm extracellular matrix (ECM) on these interactions. Data indicated that the C. albicans mycofilms supported adhesion and colonisation by S. aureus through close interactions with hyphal elements, significantly increasing S. aureus biofilm formation throughout biofilm maturation. Miconazole sensitivity was shown to be reduced in both mono- and dual-species biofilms compared to planktonic cells. Within a three-dimensional biofilm model sensitivity was also hindered. Galleria mellonella survival analysis showed both enhanced pathogenicity of the dual-species infection, which was concomitantly <b>desensitised</b> to miconazole <b>treatment.</b> Analysis of the ECM revealed the importance of extracellular DNA (eDNA), which supported the adhesion of S. aureus {{and the development of}} the dual-species biofilm structures. Collectively, these data highlight the clinical importance of dual-species inter-kingdom biofilm infections, though also provides translational opportunities to manage them more effectively...|$|R
40|$|Human Urotensin-II (U-II) is a cyclic undecapeptide {{that binds}} to the U-II {{receptor}} UT. The desensitisation mechanisms of the UT receptor (G_{q/ 11 } coupled GPCR) {{are not well}} defined and hampered by (1) lack of native (in-vitro) models; (2) paucity of ligands, especially non-peptides and (3) irreversible binding of U-II. There are some limited studies using rat aorta, where a U-II induced primary contractile response was reduced upon a secondary re-challenge after 5 -hours. Studies were undertaken to characterise cell lines expressing native (SJCRH 30) and recombinant human hUT (HEK 293 and CHO) for their suitability in binding and functional assays (PI and Ca^ 2 +). SAR {{studies were carried out}} to characterise novel analogues modified at Tyr^ 9 of the U-II(4 - 11) template. This led to the identification of [3, 5 -diiodoTyr^ 9]U-II(4 - 11) a partial agonist in aorta and Ca^ 2 + assays at rat UT. Full agonism was demonstrated at hUT in PI and Ca^ 2 + assays. Efforts were made to delineate functional and genomic desensitisation of hUT. There was no functional desensitisation in SJCRH 30. In HEK 293 hUT functional heterologous desensitisation of hUT was observed, this was not so in CHOhUT; instead P_ 2 YR was functionally attenuated. In SJCRH 30 6 -hr U-II treatments led to UT mRNA reduction. Genomic desensitisation was also studied in Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). U-II treatments alone did not affect UT mRNA. Lipolysaccharide treatment of PBMCs led to UT mRNA upregulation which was <b>desensitised</b> with U-II <b>treatments.</b> In recombinant systems UT mRNA was upregulated at 6 -hr U-II treatments. In conclusion modification of the U-II(4 - 11) template at Tyr^ 9 is useful for reducing efficacy. There is a difference in desensitisation profiles of native and recombinant hUT, where native receptors are not prone to functional desensitisation while receptor mRNA is reduced. In recombinant systems, hUT undergoes desensitisation (HEK 293 hUT only) while receptor mRNA is increased in both systems. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
