[...] By about 320 BC fine figurative vase-painting had ceased in Athens and other Greek centres, with the polychromatic Kerch style a final flourish; it was probably replaced by metalwork for most of its functions. West Slope Ware, with decorative motifs on a black glazed body, continued for over a century after.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{availability and}} deployment of imaging sensors operating in multiple spectral bands {{has led to}} a large research effort in image fusion, resulting in a plethora of pixel-level image fusion algorithms. However, the cognitive aspects of multisensor image fusion have not received much attention in the development of these methods. In this study we investigate how humans interpret visual and infrared images, and we compare the interpretation of these individual image modalities to their fused counterparts, for different image fusion schemes. This was done in an attempt to test to what degree image fusion schemes can enhance human perception of the structural layout and composition of realistic outdoor scenes. We asked human observers to manually segment the details they perceived as most prominent in a set of corresponding visual, infrared and fused images. For each scene, the segmentations of the individual input image modalities were used to derive a joint reference ("gold standard") contour image that represents the visually most salient details from both of these modalities and for that particular scene. The resulting reference images were then used to evaluate the manual segmentations of the fused images, using a precision-recall measure as the evaluation criterion. In this sense, the best fusion method provides the largest number of correctly perceived <b>details</b> (<b>originating</b> from each of the individual modalities that were used as input for the fusion scheme) and the smallest amount of false alarms (fusion artifacts or illusory details). A comparison with an objective score of subject performance indicates that the reference contour method indeed appears to characterize the performance of observers using the results of the fusion schemes. The results show that this evaluation method can provide valuable insight into the way fusion schemes combine perceptually important details from the individual input image modalities. Given a reference contour image, the method can potentially be used to design image fusion schemes that are optimally tuned to human visual perception for different applications and scenarios (e. g. environmental or weather conditions). © 2009 Elsevier B.

The inquiry <b>detailed</b> below <b>originated</b> in such questions and my desire {{to contribute to the}} larger hermeneutic community that seeks more satisfying interpretations of curriculum change and the people who live it. There is no paucity of advice for teachers. Their work world is a pre scriptive milieu peppered with criticism, exhortations, and man dates, among which are the curriculum innovations or inventions (Westbury, 1984) of educational researchers and curriculum workers. My purpose in this study was to generate grounded speculations, or hypotheses, about the mediating influence of teachers, conceived as autonomous agents, on the implementation of one such curriculum invention in their classrooms. Computer assisted instruction (CAT) was deemed an appropriate in vention for this exploration of teachers as curriculum agents. First, it was accessible. Most schools in the United States now have com puters (Quality Educational Data, 1984), {{and many of them are}} in some way implementing CAT. Second, CAT is a relatively unplanned invention and, consequently, its potential in the hands of teachers is vast. They can take the basic abstraction of CAT (using computers to help students learn the curriculum) in myriad directions and ex press it in as many forms. The invention itself is feeble compared to the level of development needed before it can be used in actual situ ations for particular purposes, so the terrain between invention and implementation is rich with practical mediation. Dorothy and Mary I interviewed two teachers over a period of eight months as they in quired into CAT and attempted to develop classroom applications. Their interest in this au courant invention had inclined them to en roll in a local university course on CAT, and in addition to this self selection, each had indicated a desire to carry on the inquiry in their elementary school settings.

Adding inference capabilities to SOA-based applications not only aids in the translation of data into information thus increasing visibility into the sea of content that is the web, but also provides a powerful mechanism for performing the domain-centric decision making that is the heart of intelligent applications. The Web Ontology Language (OWL) offers the medium and the tools necessary to represent models of business activities as well as support native inference across related semantic concepts. In this paper the authors present an architecture for combining OWL with a SOA-based paradigm to enhance traditional web applications with powerful inference capabilities.

Field survey revealed that standing groundwater exists within the landslide on the source area, and the loess on the source area was in great void ratio. Therefore, {{it is reasonable to}} infer that liquefaction failure within the water-saturated loess layer was the main reason for this long-travel landslide, rather than the assumption that these earthquake-triggered rapid landslides were due to the suspension of silt in air. To examine this assumption, ring shear tests were performed on the samples taken from the source area of Dangjiacha landslide. Undrained ring shear tests on the water-saturated loess soils applied to monotonic/cyclic shearing showed that the loess soil is highly liquefiable, and shear failure can be triggered during cyclic loading. In additional, undrained ring shear tests had also been performed on the dry sample “saturated ” by air to examine whether landslide with high mobility can be triggered or not, with the involving of air. The results revealed that the increase of pore-air pressure with increase of shear displacement was small such that n...|$|R
5000|$|A {{particular}} controversy {{attaches to}} Germanus's second visit {{as described by}} Constantius, which has been suspected as representing merely a ‘doublet’, of the first: a version that was so badly remembered that it appeared to Constantius or his source as representing an entirely different, 'second', visit. As Norah Chadwick [...] noted, in both visits the object is the same, Germanus is accompanied by another bishop and the incident of the cured boy of the second visit is matched by an incident in which Germanus cures a blind girl in the first. Then there {{is the fact that}} on both visits, as Germanus sets out, there are ‘demons’, active against him (in the first they provoke bad weather: in the second we are told they are unable to do this, but instead spread news of his approach). Professor Ian Wood [...] argued for the authenticity of the second visit: he quoted the Vita Genovefa (Life of St Genevieve) but this (perhaps 6th c. work) is one of many sources written after Constantius's Vita Germani which are likely to have been influenced by it. The allocation to Germanus of a different, named, companion - Severus instead of Lupus - remains hard to explain but it might be that it was <b>details</b> like this (<b>originating</b> perhaps with the oral transmission of one version of the tale) that persuaded Constantius that Germanus must actually have made two separate visits.|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of a warehouse using data from DuPont Pharmaceutical’s Clinical Pharmacokinetics Group with the SAS/Warehouse Administrator ™ product is described herein. Data sources incorporated into the pharmacokinetic warehouse existed in multiple formats (Oracle, Excel, SAS data sets, etc) and were represented by numerous individual files, rather then few large files. In most cases, the data density enjoys low granularity. The pharmacokinetic data warehouse draws data from many sources represented by multiple departments and spans long drug development cycles {{with varying degrees of}} <b>detail.</b> Additionally, data <b>originated</b> from both internal legacy systems or was obtained from an external contract research organization (CRO). Remote systems have been easily identified within the warehouse and views rather than distinct copies have been incorporated as data sources. The SAS/Warehouse Administrator ™ product was essential to this effort as it organized the metadata from the various operational data definitions (ODD), assisted in the cleaning / scrubbing of the data via user-written code, and facilitated the creation of multi-dimensional databases (MDDB), datamarts and infomarts which were front-ended by exploitation tools including SAS/IntrNet ™ based and SAS/EIS ® derived applications. More importantly, the warehouse is under the central control of a single administrator and refresh is scheduled {{in a manner consistent with}} the needs of the department using the Windows AT scheduler (Windows NT 4. 0). The current data warehouse will assist in multiple aspects of electronic transmission of regulatory data: data (SAS XPORT), reports, and computer assisted new drug applications (CANDA). The following SAS systems and products discussed included Base SAS®, SAS/GRAPH®, SAS/Warehouse Administrator ™ v 1. 3, SAS/SHARE®, SAS/CONNECT®, SAS/MDDB™, SAS/IntrNet ™ v 1. 2, and PH. Kinetics ™ v 2. 00...|$|R
40|$|It {{is hoped}} to {{establish}} the motives and intentions of Guernes in undertaking his poem, to evaluate his success in fulfilling his ambitions. Chapter one outlines the historical background to the dispute between Henry II and Thomas Becket; in composing this chapter no attempt {{has been made to}} exclude any historical <b>details</b> which may <b>originate</b> from Guernes' poem, or from works which Guernes may have consulted. The aim here is to give a balanced picture of events, and to this end modern historians as well as mediaeval sources have been consulted. This may lead to accusations of historical impurity in subsequent chapters, but it leaves the question of Guernes' sources open for discussion; this is a more important consideration in this study. Chapter two discusses the dating and sources of Guernes' poem, and considers the evidence and significance of the fragments of the first draft of the poem, recently discovered. Chapter three attempts {{to establish the}} intentions of the poet, by examining his own statements in the poem and attempting to establish to what degree they may be religious, devotional, panegyrical, historical or political. In chapters four to eight the poet's treatment of his material studied; chapters four, five and six are concerned predominantly with the figure of Thomas Becket, chapter seven with King Henry II and King Louis VII, chapter eight with the remaining figures in the poem. Where appropriate the poet's treatment is compared and contrasted with that of his sources, and with the surviving fragments of the first draft. Consideration is also given to Guernes’ consciousness of his audience and to how this may have influenced his treatment of material. In chapter nine the poet's achievement and his success in fulfilling his stated ambitions are evaluated...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} effect of a single, {{instantaneous}} starburst on the dynamical and chemical evolution of a gas-rich dwarf galaxy, whose potential well is dominated by a dark matter halo. We follow the dynamical and chemical evolution of the ISM by means of an improved 2 -D hydrodynamical code coupled with <b>detailed</b> chemical yields <b>originating</b> from type II SNe, type Ia SNe and single low and intermediate mass stars (IMS). In particular we follow the evolution of the abundances of H, He, C, N, O, Mg, Si and Fe. We find that for a galaxy resembling IZw 18, a galactic wind develops {{as a consequence of the}} starburst and it carries out of the galaxy mostly the metal-enriched gas. In addition, we find that different metals are lost differentially in the sense that the elements produced by type Ia SNe are more efficiently lost than others. As a consequence of that we predict larger [α/Fe] ratios for the gas inside the galaxy than for the gas leaving the galaxy. A comparison of our predicted abundances of C, N, O and Si in the case of a burst occurring in a primordial gas shows a very good agreement with the observed abundances in IZw 18 as long as the burst has an age of ∼ 31 Myr and IMS produce some primary nitrogen. However, we cannot exclude that a previous burst of star formation had occurred in IZw 18 especially if the preenrichment produced by the older burst was lower than Z= 0. 01 Z_. Finally, at variance with previous studies, we find that most of the metals reside in the cold gas phase already after few Myr. This result is mainly due to the assumed low SNII heating efficiency, and justifies the generally adopted homogeneous and instantaneous mixing of gas in chemical evolution models.
