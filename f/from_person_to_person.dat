5|$|Naming is a {{symbolic}} {{tradition of the}} islands' Maori population. Names form a link not only to ancestors, descendents, and friends, but to titles and land, as well as events and relationships. Dreamed or created, name change {{are not limited to}} events, such as birth, marriage, and death, but can also occur in association with a bad omen. First names are interchangeable between men and women, while surnames can vary <b>from</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>person</b> within a family unit.|$|E
5|$|Poliovirus {{is usually}} spread <b>from</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>person</b> through {{infected}} fecal matter entering the mouth. It {{may also be}} spread by food or water containing human feces and less commonly from infected saliva. Those who are infected may spread the disease {{for up to six}} weeks even if no symptoms are present. The disease may be diagnosed by finding the virus in the feces or detecting antibodies against it in the blood. The disease only occurs naturally in humans.|$|E
5|$|Viral {{epidemiology}} is {{the branch}} of medical science that deals with the transmission and control of virus infections in humans. Transmission of viruses can be vertical, which means from mother to child, or horizontal, which means <b>from</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>person.</b> Examples of vertical transmission include hepatitis B virus and HIV, where the baby is born already infected with the virus. Another, more rare, example is the varicella zoster virus, which, although causing relatively mild infections in humans, can be fatal to the foetus and newborn baby.|$|E

5|$|The {{reason for}} the rise of polio in industrialised {{countries}} in the 20th century has never been fully explained. The disease {{is caused by a}} virus that is passed <b>from</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>person</b> by the faecal-oral route, and naturally infects only humans. It is a paradox that it became a problem during times of improved sanitation and increasing affluence. Although the virus was discovered {{at the beginning of the}} 20th century, its ubiquity was unrecognised until the 1950s. It is now known that fewer than two per cent of individuals who are infected develop the disease, and most infections are mild. During epidemics the virus was effectively everywhere, which explains why public health officials were unable to isolate a source.|$|E

500|$|Ācārya Amṛtacandra has {{described}} {{as to how}} the consequences of violence (karmas attracted) differ <b>from</b> <b>person</b> <b>to</b> <b>persons</b> for similar and different types of acts. A small violence may bring serious consequences <b>to</b> one <b>person,</b> while <b>to</b> another <b>person</b> grievous violence may bring about lesser consequences. For instance, a person hunting and killing only one small animal suffers severe consequences while a person who is building a temple or hospital suffers milder karmic consequences even though its construction kills many animals. Even when violence is jointly committed by two persons, the same act may result in severe consequence for one person and mild consequence for another person. This may happen in the case where the leader and planner of violence binds severe karmas, while a follower binds much lesser karmas. One who actually does not commit violence may be responsible for hiṃsā while one who actually commits violence is not responsible for hiṃsā. For instance, a burglar who fails in his robbery is still a felon but a diligent surgeon who is trying to save a patient is not responsible for violence even if a patient dies during the surgery. Persons who have not committed violence may become responsible for violence committed by others. This may happen when a violence which is carried out by someone is approved and instigated by someone else. [...] often gives result of himsa to one and himsa may sometimes give result of ahimsa to another. For instance, one <b>person</b> saves another <b>from</b> oppression by use of violence and hence enjoys consequences of ahimsa although resorting to violence, while another does not act to save someone wishing that the other person is not saved and thus suffers the consequences of violence although he may have not actually done anything.|$|R

500|$|Before {{reaching}} Cyrus, {{the song}} had {{been rejected by}} several country artists.

Chelsom found what would become [...] "The Climb" [...] while visiting Nashville, Tennessee, during a quest to find eleven new songs for Hannah Montana: The Movie. After hearing Alexander's music, Chelsom asked her to submit songs for consideration. Alexander recorded [...] "It's the Climb" [...] on a CD {{and gave it to}} him. Several weeks later, Chelsom called to say that [...] "the song was gonna {{be an integral part of}} the movie". However, he wanted Mabe and Alexander to rework some of the song's content and to change the song <b>from</b> third <b>person</b> <b>to</b> first <b>person.</b> Alexander felt the changes amounted to a [...] "substantial amount of the song" [...] and commented, [...] "For me, when you change something <b>from</b> third <b>person</b> <b>to</b> first <b>person,</b> it can change the whole meaning of a line." [...] She and Mabe [...] "wrestl over taking words out" [...] and how much they could change while maintaining the song's integrity.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{measures and}} statistical tests for multiplexity and exchange that are modeled on similar ideas developed for reciprocity quite {{early in the}} history of social network research. As properties of a multi-relation network, multiplexity, and exchange have almost as ancient a history as reciprocity, but have not been as intensively investigated from a methodological perspective. Multiplexity refers {{to the extent to which}} two ties, for example, advice and friendship, coincide over population; that is, do respondents name the same people as friends as the persons they nominate as individuals from who they seek advice. Exchange refers to the extent to which a tie of one type directed <b>from</b> <b>person</b> i <b>to</b> <b>person</b> j is returned by a tie of another type from j to i. We conceive of the current paper as the first part of a two-part paper, wherein the second part explores specific theoretical models for multiplexity and exchange. © Springer Science + Business Media B.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} semiparametric relative-risk {{regression models}} for infectious disease data based on contact intervals, where the contact interval <b>from</b> <b>person</b> i <b>to</b> <b>person</b> j {{is the time}} between the onset of infectiousness in i and infectious contact from i to j. The hazard of infectious contact from i to j is λ_ 0 (τ) r(β_ 0 ^T X_ij), where λ_ 0 (τ) is an unspecified baseline hazard function, r is a relative risk function, β_ 0 is an unknown covariate vector, and X_ij is a covariate vector. When who-infects-whom is observed, the Cox partial likelihood is a profile likelihood for β maximized over all possible λ_ 0 (τ). When who-infects-whom is not observed, we use an EM algorithm to maximize the profile likelihood for β integrated over all possible combinations of who-infected-whom. This extends the most important class of regression models in survival analysis to infectious disease epidemiology. Comment: 38 pages, 5 figure...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{nonparametric methods}} {{for the survival}} analysis of epidemic data based on contact intervals. The contact interval <b>from</b> <b>person</b> i <b>to</b> <b>person</b> j is the time between the onset of infectiousness in i and infectious contact from i to j, where we define infectious contact as a contact sufficient to infect a susceptible individual. We show that the Nelson-Aalen estimator produces an unbiased estimate of the contact interval cumulative hazard function when who-infects-whom is observed. When who-infects-whom is not observed, we average the Nelson-Aalen estimates from all transmission networks consistent with the observed data using an EM algorithm. This converges to a nonparametric MLE of the contact interval cumulative hazard function that we call the marginal Nelson-Aalen estimate. We study the behavior of these methods in simulations {{and use them to}} analyze household surveillance data from the 2009 influenza A(H 1 N 1) pandemic. In an appendix, we show that these methods extend chain-binomial models to continuous time. Comment: 30 pages, 6 figure...|$|R
