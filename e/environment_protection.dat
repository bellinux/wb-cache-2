5|$|Alloxylon flammeum is {{a canopy}} or {{emergent}} tree of the Mabi rainforest community of north Queensland. Its terminal tubular flowers {{indicate that the}} species is pollinated by birds. Readily adaptable to cultivation, Alloxylon flammeum prefers a site with good drainage and responds well to extra moisture and fertilisers low in phosphorus. It is listed nationally as vulnerable under the Australian <b>Environment</b> <b>Protection</b> and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) as most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and logging.|$|E
5|$|Banksia oligantha {{is listed}} as an {{endangered}} species under the federal <b>Environment</b> <b>Protection</b> and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), and as rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. These rankings are due to its small and severely fragmented distribution, and the ongoing degradation of its habitat. Threats include grazing by sheep and rabbits, drought, the drift of aerosol chemicals from surrounding farmland, invasion by weeds, and rising salinity. Studies have shown it to be moderately susceptible to Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback.|$|E
5|$|These {{concerns}} aside, B.integrifolia {{does not}} appear to be under threat.

5|$|Alloxylon flammeum {{is listed}} nationally as {{vulnerable}} under the Australian <b>Environment</b> <b>Protection</b> and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act), {{which indicates that}} there is a high risk it will become extinct in the wild in the mid-term future. Before the establishment of the EPBC Act, it was, and currently remains, listed as vulnerable under the state-based Nature Conservation Act 1992. Furthermore, it was listed by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) in 1997. Most of its habitat has been cleared for agriculture and development. Remaining stands in protected areas are highly fragmented. Furthermore, plants in cultivation are likely to come from a limited genetic pool. With under 2% of its original extent remaining, the rainforest is threatened by invasive plants and grazing by feral and domestic animals.|$|E

5|$|In 2016, {{the green}} rosella was rated as least concern on the IUCN Red List of Endangered species. This {{was on the}} basis of its large range—greater than 20,000km2 (7700mi2)—and small rate of decline in population. The King Island {{subspecies}} is listed under the <b>Environment</b> <b>Protection</b> and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 as vulnerable, and its population thought to number fewer than 500 birds. Around 70% of King Island's native vegetation has been cleared, and the remainder is highly fragmented and at risk of too-frequent bushfires. Like most species of parrots, the green rosella is protected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES) with its placement on the Appendix II list of vulnerable species, which makes the import, export, and trade of listed wild-caught animals illegal.|$|E

5|$|While the koala was {{previously}} classified as Least Concern on the Red List, it was uplisted to Vulnerable in 2016. Australian policy makers declined a 2009 proposal {{to include the}} koala in the <b>Environment</b> <b>Protection</b> and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. In 2012, the Australian government listed koala populations in Queensland and New South Wales as Vulnerable, because of a 40% population decline in the former and a 33% decline in the latter. Populations in Victoria and South Australia appear to be abundant; however, the Australian Koala Foundation argues that the exclusion of Victorian populations from protective measures {{is based on a}} misconception that the total koala population is 200,000, whereas they believe it is probably less than 100,000.|$|E
5|$|Around 90% of the {{turquoise}} parrot population resides in New South Wales. The species is not listed as threatened on the Commonwealth <b>Environment</b> <b>Protection</b> and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, though a status of near threatened was proposed by Stephen Garnett and Gabriel Crowley in their 2000 work The Action Plan for Australian Birds {{on account of}} the significant reduction in distribution. Its population and range have varied wildly; widely distributed across eastern Australia from Mackay to Melbourne up to the 1880s, it vanished from much of its range {{to the extent that it}} was presumed extinct in 1915. It was not recorded from Queensland between 1923 and 1950, and Victoria between the mid-1880s and 1949. However, numbers in New South Wales began increasing in the 1930s and the species had repopulated East Gippsland by the 1960s. Tentatively estimated at 20,000 breeding birds in 2000, the population is thought to be still rising.|$|E
5|$|Banksia verticillata {{has been}} {{declared}} vulnerable under the federal <b>Environment</b> <b>Protection</b> and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999, and Rare under Western Australia's Wildlife Conservation Act 1950. A 1995 census yielded an estimated total population size of 4500 plants. Apart from dieback and aerial canker, frequency of bushfires and illegal picking have been cited as threats. Ongoing management includes monitoring of current populations, gathering more data on best response to fire, and restricting access to populations. Seed has been collected from many populations, but germination rates after ten years of storage are much lower than in Banksia brownii. Translocation is considered an option in the future, as is spraying with phosphite, particularly {{in the vicinity of}} Walpole. Used successfully on B.brownii but as yet untrialled with B.verticillata, phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed as studies have shown that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth.|$|E

5|$|In John Gould's Handbook to the Birds of Australia, first {{published}} in 1865, he lamented {{the loss of the}} emu from Tasmania, where it had become rare and has since become extinct; he noted that emus were no longer common in the vicinity of Sydney and proposed that the species be given protected status. In the 1930s, emu killings in Western Australia peaked at 57,000, and culls were also mounted in Queensland during this period due to rampant crop damage. In the 1960s, bounties were still being paid in Western Australia for killing emus, but since then, wild emus have been granted formal protection under the <b>Environment</b> <b>Protection</b> and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Their occurrence range is between , and a 1992 census suggested that their total population was between 630,000 and 725,000. As of 2012, the International Union for Conservation of Nature considers their population trend to be stable and assesses their conservation status as being of least concern. The isolated emu population of the New South Wales North Coast Bioregion and Port Stephens is listed as endangered by the New South Wales Government.|$|E
5|$|Loggerhead {{sea turtles}} are {{classified}} as endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and are listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species, making international trade illegal. In the United States, the Fish and Wildlife Service and National Marine Fisheries Service classify them as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. Loggerheads are listed as endangered under both Australia's <b>Environment</b> <b>Protection</b> and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 and Queensland's Nature Conservation Act 1992. The Convention on Migratory Species works {{for the conservation of}} loggerhead sea turtles on the Atlantic coast of Africa, {{as well as in the}} Indian Ocean and southeast Asia. Throughout Japan, the Sea Turtle Association of Japan aids in the conservation of loggerhead sea turtles. Greece's ARCHELON works for their conservation. The Marine Research Foundation works for loggerhead conservation in Oman. Annex 2 of the Specially Protected Areas and Wildlife Protocol of the Cartagena Convention, which deals with pollution that could harm marine ecosystems, also protects them. Conservation organizations worldwide have worked with the shrimp trawling industry to develop turtle exclusion devices (TEDs) to exclude even the largest turtles. TEDs are mandatory for all shrimp trawlers.|$|E
5|$|The unranked group Isostylis, {{with its}} one species, was {{reclassified}} as a {{section in the}} 1856 arrangement of Carl Meissner, and 1870 arrangement of George Bentham. In his 1981 revision of the genus, Alex George reclassified {{the group as a}} subgenus—Banksia subg. Isostylis—defined by the dome-shaped flower heads, with B.ilicifolia joined by newly described species B.cuneata and later B.oligantha. Banksia ilicifolia is the only common member of that subgenus; the two other species are rare and threatened, and are protected under the <b>Environment</b> <b>Protection</b> and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. Relationships between B.ilicifolia and the other members of B.subg. Isostylis still remain unclear. Although DNA studies found B.cuneata to be the most basal of the three species, a 2004 study of genetic divergence within the subgenus yielded both other possibilities: some analyses suggested B.ilicifolia as basal, while others suggested B.oligantha. Biogeographical factors suggest that B.ilicifolia would be the most basal of the three species: it occurs in the High Rainfall Zone where relictual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the Transitional Rainfall Zone, where more recently evolved species are most common.|$|E

5|$|The white-bellied sea eagle {{is listed}} under the marine and migratory {{categories}} which give it protected status under Australia's federal <b>Environment</b> <b>Protection</b> and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999. As a mainly coastal species, it {{is vulnerable to}} habitat destruction in Australia's increasingly populated and urbanised coastal areas, particularly {{in the south and}} east of the country, where it appears to have declined in numbers. However, there may have been an increase in population inland, secondary to the creation of reservoirs, dams and weirs, and the spread of the introduced common carp (Cyprinus carpio). However, it is rare along the Murray River where it was once common. It is also listed as Threatened under Victoria's Flora and Fauna Guarantee Act (1988), with possibly fewer than 100 breeding pairs remaining in the state. On the 2007 advisory list of threatened vertebrate fauna in Victoria, the white-bellied sea eagle is listed as vulnerable.|$|E
5|$|Mulvihill {{continued}} {{breeding and}} promoting the ponies, and in 2002, the breed was recognised by the Irish Government as the Irish Heritage Pony. The same year, the Kerry Bog Pony Society was formed. Also in 2002, Americans {{became interested in}} the breed, and the first ponies were exported from Ireland to the US in 2003, to a farm in Ohio. In 2005, the American Kerry Bog Pony Society was founded, with 11 initial registrants. Also in 2005, the Irish Department of Agriculture and Food and the European Commission recognised the Kerry Bog Pony as an official breed; the following year, the Irish Horse Board issued the first equine passports for members of the breed. Until 2009, there was an exception in place that allowed unrelated ponies that met the physical breed standards to be bred as Kerry Bog Ponies, with the offspring being registered and given passports certifying them as purebred Kerry Bog Ponies. This was in part due to a concern of inbreeding among the small number of ponies initially registered. Kerry Bog Ponies were also part of the Irish Rural <b>Environment</b> <b>Protection</b> Scheme (closed to new applicants in 2009), which financially rewarded farmers for using environmentally-friendly methods. The Kerry Bog Village, an open-air museum on the Ring of Kerry is one location that breeds and houses part of the existing Kerry Bog Pony population.|$|E
