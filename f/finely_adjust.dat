50|$|Parachute: Some high {{performance}} gliders from the 1960s and 1970s {{were designed to}} carry a small drogue parachute because their air brakes were not particularly effective. This was stored in the tail-cone of the glider during flight. When deployed, a parachute causes a large increase in drag, but has a significant disadvantage over the other methods of controlling the glide slope. This is because a parachute does not allow the pilot to <b>finely</b> <b>adjust</b> the glide slope.

50|$|Stacked dado set {{consists}} of two circular saw blades fixed {{on either side of}} a set of removable chippers. As the dado set spins, the two outside blades cut the dado walls and the chippers remove the waste material in between and smooth the bottom of the dado. The chippers are added or removed to the set as required to make a dado of the desired width. Chippers can also be interspersed with spacers to <b>finely</b> <b>adjust</b> the dado width. Consequently, changing the dado width requires the complete removal of the dado blade set from the arbor. After disassembly, chippers and/or spacers are used to achieve the desired width of the dado set.|$|E
50|$|In {{order to}} {{maintain}} an extremely light tracking force, the stylus arm is surrounded by coils which sense deflection, and a circuit in the player responds to the signals from these coils by moving the stylus head carriage in steps as the groove pulls the stylus across the disc. Other coils are used to deflect the stylus, to <b>finely</b> <b>adjust</b> tracking. This system is very similar to—yet predates—the one used in Compact Disc players to follow the spiral optical track, where typically a servo motor moves the optical pickup in steps for coarse tracking {{and a set of}} coils tilts the laser lens for fine tracking, both guided by an optical sensing device which is the analogue of CED stylus deflection sensing coils. For the CED player, this tracking arrangement has the additional benefit that the stylus drag angle remains uniformly tangent to the groove, unlike the case for a phonograph tonearm in which the stylus drag angle and consequently the stylus side force varies with the tone arm angle, which in turn depends on the radial position on the record of the stylus. Whereas for a phonograph, where the stylus has a pinpoint tip, linear tracking is merely ideal to reduce wear of records and styli and to maximize tracking stability, for a CED player linear tracking is a necessity for the keel-shaped stylus, which must always stay tangent to the groove. Furthermore, the achievement of an extremely light tracking force on the CED stylus enables the use of a fine groove pitch (i.e. fine spacing of adjacent revolutions of the spiral), necessary to provide a long playing time at the required high rotational speed, while also limiting the rate of disc and stylus wear.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Flexibility can {{significantly}} impact performance. Some component-based frameworks {{come with a}} near to zero overhead but provide only build-time configurability. Other solutions provide {{a high degree of}} flexibility but with an uncontrollable and a possibly unaccept-able impact on performance. We believe that no flexible systems give programmers a means to control the inherent overhead introduced by flexibility. This prevents from reaching acceptable tradeoffs between per-formance and flexibility, according to the applications needs or hardware targets. This paper presents an ongoing work that aims to redesign the existing Think component framework. Once revisited, the framework makes possible to <b>finely</b> <b>adjust</b> the flexibility to the actually desired needs and thus better control the induced performance overhead. A cat-egorization of the dimensions of flexibility is also introduced in order to articulate our proposition. ...|$|E

40|$|International audienceDespite their {{apparent}} simple preparation by sol-gel process, silsesquioxanes based {{materials are}} quite complex and rich systems. Accordingly, {{a clear understanding}} of their elaboration chemistry and its relations to process and properties are important matter. In the particular case of thin film preparation, vitrification must be controlled to ensure high throughput and reliability. Using methylsilsesquioxane based films as a relevant model and a combination of IR spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and solution 29 Si NMR, a meaningful description of the film structure was obtained. Furthermore, vitrification, observed by dynamic mechanical analysis, was shown to depend strongly on the amounts of cages and extended structures present in the films. More interestingly, the proportion of these species can be tuned through a careful control of the elaboration chemistry. On one hand, long aging and high dilution yield a larger amount of cages, which results in a delay of the vitrification. On the other hand, pH appears as the convenient parameter to <b>finely</b> <b>adjust</b> the time span during which high quality films can be prepared from the sols, while preserving the film composition and final properties...|$|E

Increasing the number of electrodes is attractive as it provides the opportunity to <b>finely</b> <b>adjust</b> droplet size, and also increases the number of droplets that can be individually moved simultaneously. The tradeoffs associated with minimising the drive voltage by appropriate choice of dielectric thickness, strength and permittivity, are discussed and examples presented of systems with the ability to move liquid droplets using voltages between 27 and 70 V. A small electrode array has been designed using transistors with high voltage shields using a 100 V CMOS process. This circuitry has been fabricated and can successfully apply 90 V to the electrodes.

40|$|International audienceThis paper investigates how {{tennis players}} control stroke-induced vibration. Its {{aim is to}} characterise how a tennis player deals with {{entering}} vibration waves or how he/she {{has the ability to}} <b>finely</b> <b>adjust</b> them. A specific experimental procedure was designed, based on simultaneously collecting sets of kinematic, vibration and electromyographic data during forehand strokes using various commercial rackets and stroke intensities. Using 14 expert players, a wide range of excitations at spectral and temporal levels were investigated. Energetic and spectral descriptors of stroke-induced vibration occurring at the racket handle and at the player's wrist and elbow were computed. Results indicated that vibrational characteristics are strongly governed by grip force and to a lower extent by the racket properties. Grip force management drives the amount of energy, as well as its distribution, into the forearm. Furthermore, hand-grip can be assimilated to an adaptive filter which can significantly modify the spectral parameters propagating into the player's upper limb. A significant outcome is that these spectral characteristics are as much dependent on the player as on the racket. This contribution opens up new perspectives in equipment manufacture by underlining the need to account for player/racket interaction in the design process...|$|E

40|$|The plastid-localized methylerythritol {{phosphate}} (MEP) pathway synthesizes the isoprenoid {{precursors for}} the production of essential photosynthesis-related compounds and hormones. We have identified an Arabidopsis thaliana mutant, rif 1, in which posttranscriptional upregulation of MEP pathway enzyme levels is caused by the loss of function of At 3 g 47450, a gene originally reported to encode a mitochondrial protein related to nitric oxide synthesis. However, we show that nitric oxide is not involved in the regulation of the MEP pathway and that the encoded protein is a plastid-targeted homolog of the Bacillus subtilis YqeH protein, a GTPase required for proper ribosome assembly. Consistently, in rif 1 seedlings, decreased levels of plastome-encoded proteins were observed, with the exception of ClpP 1, a catalytic subunit of the plastidial Clp protease complex. The unexpected accumulation of ClpP 1 in plastids with reduced protein synthesis suggested a compensatory mechanism in response to decreased Clp activity levels. In agreement, a negative correlation was found between Clp protease activity and MEP pathway enzyme levels in different experiments, suggesting that Clp-mediated degradation of MEP pathway enzymes might be a mechanism used by individual plastids to <b>finely</b> <b>adjust</b> plastidial isoprenoid biosynthesis to their functional and physiological states...|$|E

Reductions of red to far-red ratio (R:FR) generated by an increase of the plant canopy above the plant are sensed by the phytochrome system triggering the shade-avoidance syndrome (SAS) that includes elongation of vegetative structures, reduction of branching and acceleration of flowering. Albeit the SAS is a strategy of major adaptative significance in plant communities, involving massive changes in gene expression, {{our knowledge of the}} SAS signaling network is still fragmented. By a selection and characterization of a T-DNA mutant with a long hypocotyl under shade, we identified BBX 21, a protein with two B-box domains, that is involved in the SAS. BBX 21 belongs to a small eight member family of B-box. containing proteins with both opposite and additive functions in the SAS signaling. BBX 21 downregulates the gene expression of auxin, brassinosteroid and ethylene signaling pathway components under shade. Furthermore BBX 21 is a transcription factor that interacts genetically with COP 1.

40|$|Besides an {{essential}} source of energy, light provides environmental information to plants. Photosensory pathways {{are thought to}} have occurred early in plant evolution, probably {{at the time of the}} Archaeplastida ancestor, or perhaps even earlier. Manipulation of individual components of light perception and signaling networks in tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) affects the metabolism of ripening fruit at several levels. Most strikingly, recent experiments have shown that some of the molecular mechanisms originally devoted to sense and respond to environmental light cues have been re-adapted during evolution to provide plants with useful information on fruit ripening progression. In particular, the presence of chlorophylls in green fruit can strongly influence the spectral composition of the light filtered through the fruit pericarp. The concomitant changes in light quality can be perceived and transduced by phytochromes (PHYs) and PHY-interacting factors, respectively, to regulate gene expression and in turn modulate the production of carotenoids, a family of metabolites that are relevant for the final pigmentation of ripe fruits. We raise the hypothesis that the evolutionary recycling of light-signaling components to <b>finely</b> <b>adjust</b> pigmentation to the actual ripening stage of the fruit may have represented a selective advantage for primeval fleshy-fruited plants even before the extinction of dinosaur...|$|E
