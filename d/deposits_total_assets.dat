For this purpose, two state banks, Bank of Ceylon and Peoples ’ bank and four private banks, namely, Commercial bank, Seylan bank, Hatton National Bank and Sampath were selected over the period 2009 - 2012. By using Data envelopment analysis (DEA) {{total factor productivity}} and its components were {{measured in terms of}} efficiency change, technical efficiency change, pure efficiency change and scale change. The data related to interest income and amount of loans which were considered as two outputs and amount of <b>deposits,</b> <b>total</b> <b>assets,</b> number of staff and interest expenses considered as four inputs were collected from annual reports of Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) in Sri Lanka and were analyzed on the assumption of output oriented method with constant returns to scale. It was found that, all six banks operate averagely at 87. 2 percent of overall efficiency and it reveals the less performance of the banks. This less performance was achieved due to the less progress in technical change than efficiency change and the finding highlights that technical change has been the main constraint to achieve a high level of total factor productivity of commercial banks in Sri Lanka. Among the private banks, Seylan bank has the highest efficiency of 1. 033 than other banks and among the state banks, Peoples ’ bank have the values of 0. 773 than Bank of Ceylon.

As financial intermediaries, banks {{play a crucial role}} in the economic growth of the country through making available the funds for investors to borrow as well as financial deepening in the country. Therefore, the success of working in the banks creates possibilities for more efficient (cheaper) crediting of economic entities which results in an increased potential for investing of the enterprises and encouraging the personal people’s spending.

The objective {{of this paper is to}} analyze, by applying the bootstrap DEA, the efficiency of banks in Brazil in 2010 - 2013. The methodology was applied to 30 largest banking organizations in a financial intermediation approach. In that model, the resources entering a bank in the form of <b>deposits</b> and <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> are classified as inputs and besides these manual labor is also considered as a resource capable of generating results. For the output variable, credit operations represent the most appropriate alternative, considering the role of the bank as a financial intermediary. In this work, the matter of the best classification among retail banks and banks specialized in credit has little relevance. The low relevance in this type of comparison is a result of analysis by segments (segments were analyzed separately). The results presented here point to an average level of efficiency for the large Brazilian banks in the period. This scenario requires efforts to reduce expenses but also to increase revenues...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to estimatethe effects of {{different}} balance sheet determinants on the interest rate risk exposure of banks operating in developed and developing financial markets. The quantification of the analysed exposure contributes to the process of identifying, monitoring and managing interest rate risk. As a sample of a developed financial market we surveyed 65 bank holding companies in the United States, whereas the sample of a developing financial market included 10 banks from the Republic of Serbia, which are listed on the Belgrade Stock Exchange. A comparative analysis of the influence of the balance sheet characteristics was conducted on the basis of the results of Stone’s regression model and the Econometric panel model. Based on the obtained regression coefficients, we conclude that growth of <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> in banks in the United States results in increases in exposure to interest rate risk, while in Serbia the relationship seems to be inverse. Furthermore, the results show that an increase in the share of <b>deposits</b> in <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> of the U. S. banks reduces exposure to interest rate risk, while banks in the Republic of Serbia experience an opposite effect. The coefficients also suggest that there are some empirical factors whose effects are universal. For instance, both an increase in return on average equity (ROAE) and a decrease in net interest income lead to reductions of interest rate sensitivity, regardless of the level of development of the market where the banks operate...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyze the financial performance of banking sector in India by classifying the banks based on their financial characteristics. A total of thirty six banks (17 private and 19 public sector banks) were considered for analysis, and simple regression model was used to estimate the impact of asset management, operational efficiency, and bank size on the financial performance. The study reveals that the banks with higher <b>total</b> capital, <b>deposits,</b> and <b>total</b> <b>assets</b> do not always mean that they have better financial performance. The overall banking industry is strongly influenced by asset utilization (ASSTUTZ), operational efficiency (OPEFF), log of asset size (Log of ASSTSIZ), in addition to return on assets (ROA) and interest income (INTINC). Private sector banks are positively influenced by asset utilization (ASSTUTZ), and operational efficiency (OPEFF) with interest income (INTINC). While, public sector banks are strongly and positively influenced by operational efficiency (OPEFF), asset management (ASSTMGT), return on assets (ROA) and interest income (INTINC). This shows that public sector banks performed remarkably well during the period than that of the private sector banks. The overall regression analysis shows that the financial performance of the banking industry is strongly and positively influenced by the operational efficiency, asset management, and interest income size...|$|R

A Chow test reveals that market structure variables do not measure market concentration in single bank communities and multiple bank communities equally well when banks from both types of communities are contained in the sample. Empirical results also indicate that Production Credit Associations influence the ratio of time and savings <b>deposits</b> to <b>total</b> <b>deposits</b> at agricultural banks but do not influence the ratio of loans to total assets;Changes in banking market structure that result from financial deregulation apparently will affect the liability side of agricultural bank balance sheets more strongly than the asset side. In order to mitigate the negative impacts of financial deregulation, bank owners and managers should seek ways of improving management ability.
