40|$|From 10 to 60 % of the nitrate {{present in}} plant tissue {{extracts}} and stem exudates of corn (Zea mays L.) {{was found to}} be reduced during <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>digestion,</b> {{even in the absence of}} added reducing agents. This reduction is of particular concern in [15 N]nitrate assimilation studies, because it results in an overestimate of nitrate reduction. To overcome this problem, a method was developed for removing nitrate prior to <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>digestion,</b> thereby preventing nitrate reduction. The procedure utilizes hydrogen peroxide for partial oxidation of organic matter in order to minimize the nitration of organic compounds. The free nitrates are then volatilized as nitric acid from concentrated sulfuric acid at 95 °C. When the proposed method was used as a pretreatment to <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>digestion,</b> less than 0. 5 % of the applied nitrate was recovered in the reduced nitrogen fraction of plant tissue extracts and stem exudates...|$|R

40|$|This {{study of}} the {{measurement}} and behaviour of nitrogen in soil is split into three main parts: 1) An investigation of the <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>digestion</b> method for measuring total nitrogen in soil and plant materials. 2) A {{study of the}} effect of air drying, temperature and repeated ammonium application on nitrification rates and 3) An investigation of ammonium contamination at a former nylon factory site. The investigation of the <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>digestion</b> method was made by comparing measured values of total nitrogen using a standard <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>digestion</b> method and salicylic acid modification digestion method. For each method three different catalyst mixtures were used. Measurements were made of certified reference plant materials (hay and cabbage) and a comparison was made of two soil samples. The standard <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>digestion</b> method with 1 g of sodium sulphate/copper sulphate mixture (100 : 10) measured significantly lower nitrogen (P&# 60; 5 %) than the certified reference value for hay but not cabbage. Significantly lower (P&# 60; 5 %) total nitrogen was measured in soil samples than with 2. 5 g of sodium sulphate/copper sulphate mixture (110 : 10) and Kjeltabs (2. 5 g potassium sulphate/copper sulphate/selenium, 100 : 10 : 1). The reason for the lower recovery of total nitrogen with 1 g of catalyst is the lower digestion temperature which causes incomplete digestion. The 2. 5 g of catalyst mixture and Kjeltabs with the standard method gave significantly (P&# 60; 5 %) higher total nitrogen than the certified values for both hay and cabbage. The high values of total nitrogen measured for plant material were probably due to variable recovery of the high levels of nitrate which were present in the plant material at 3. 1 mg g - 1 (hay) and 3. 2 mg g- 1 (cabbage). The salicylic acid modification method measured significantly higher total nitrogen than the certified reference values using all catalyst mixtures with both plant materials. This higher recovery of total nitrogen was due to partial recovery of nitrate as the method used for the certified values would not have recovered nitrate...|$|R

40|$|Eutrophication, {{the over}} {{enrichment}} of nutrients in an aquatic system, {{is associated with}} harmful algal blooms, and as such is a serious environmental issue. Consequently, interest in the monitoring of nutrient concentrations in aquatic systems has increased in tandem with a burgeoning public and scientific awareness of environmental problems. This thesis describes {{the development of a}} number of flow analysis techniques for the monitoring of nutrient concentrations in natural waters; namely total phosphorus and total nitrogen, as well as the design and construction of a total internal reflective flow-cell for use in flow analysis systems. The portable flow analysis system for the determination of total phosphorus in natural waters was designed with rapid underway monitoring in mind. The digestion module consisted of a ultra-violet photo-reactor, thermal heating unit, in-line filter and debubbler, with sample being merged with an acidic peroxodisulfate digestion reagent. A multi-commutational flow analysis unit was used to introduce gaspressurised molybdenum blue chromogenic reagents using two miniaturised solenoid valves, followed by spectrophotometric detection using a multi-reflective flow cell with a light emitting diode source and photo-diode detector. The fully automated system has a throughput of 115 measurements per hour, a detection limit of 1. 3 μgPL- 1, is highly linear over the calibration range of 0 - 200 μgPL- 1 (r 2 = 0. 9998), and a precision of 4. 6 %RSD at 100 μgPL- 1 (n= 10). Shipboard field validation of the instrument and method was performed in Port Philip and Western Port Bays in Victoria, SE Australia, where 2499 analyses were performed over a 25 hour period, over a cruise path of 285 kilometres. Good agreement was observed between determinations of samples taken manually and analysed in the laboratory and those measured in situ with the flow analysis system. Historically, total nitrogen has been determined by <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>digestion</b> or oxidative digestion to nitrate followed by reduction of the generated nitrate to nitrate by cadmium with spectrophotometric detection via the Griess assay. The <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>digestion</b> does not measure nitrate and nitrite, and the reduction of nitrate to nitrite involves the use of a toxic cadmium reagent that degrades rapidly in the presence of residual oxidant. The flow analysis system developed for the measurement of total nitrogen involves photo-oxidation of all nitrogenous compounds in the presence of alkaline peroxodisulfate, with in-line filtration and debubbling, followed by ultraviolet second derivative spectrophotometric detection of the nitrate generated. A ten minute stop flow period in the photo-reactor removes a substantial amount of residual oxidant, which is a spectral interferent in the 220 nm range used to quantify nitrate. Second derivative spectroscopy is used to minimise interference from any residual oxidant, as well as other species such as sulfate. The fully automated system has a throughput of 5 measurements per hour taken in triplicate, has a detection limit of 0. 05 mgNL- 1, is highly linear over the calibration range of 0 - 2 mgNL- 1 (r 2 = 0. 9989), and features a precision of 1. 2 %RSD for 1 mgNL- 1 as ammonia (n = 10). Excellent agreement was found between storm water samples measured using the flow analysis system in comparison to those obtained using a reference method. The design and construction of a total internal reflective photometric flow-through cell is described. This cell consists of a tubular length of fused silica quartz capillary, where light is introduced and collected from the cell using quartz optical fibres. Incident light undergoes total internal reflection at the air-quartz external wall interface, and thus undergoes multiple reflections as it propagates through the capillary. This cell was found to have several desirable features in common with liquid core waveguides (efficient light throughput that leads to high signal to noise ratio, versatile choice of irradiant light wavelength) and coated capillary multireflective cells (low hydrodynamic dispersion, no entrapment of bubbles, high tolerance to refractive index effects) ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Major food {{constituents}} such as proteins, {{fats and}} carbohydrates are generally recognised {{as having a}} strong influence {{on the performance of}} acid sample digestion. Various Scheffé mixture experimental designs were used to detect the influence and the interactions between these constituents during the <b>Kjeldahl</b> nitrogen <b>digestion</b> using focused microwaves. Pure ingredients were mixed in different proportions in order to prepare 7 synthetic food samples covering a wide range of foods types. 3 heating powers were applied and nitrogen recovery yields were recorded at different times. Two types of models were proposed to describe the data: one that explains the shape of the recovery profiles, the other that gives the response surfaces of the recovery yield as a function of digestion time. From these models precise guidelines to optimise the digestion program of a given food can be deduce...|$|R
40|$|Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. A dual phase gas diffusion-FIA system containing a tubular PTFE-membrane was studied as a mean of producing gas samples for routine 15 N/ 14 N isotopic ratio mass spectrometry. The method is based on Rittenberg's reaction; the ammonium sample is injected into a liquid alkaline stream containing hypobromite and the N 2 gas produced in the reaction diffuses across a PTFE-membrane into a helium carrier stream which carries it to the detector. Initially here, {{the use of a}} tubular microporous PTFE-membrane as a device for the preconcentration of samples in aqueous solutions was investigated. The performance of such a membrane was studied under a variety of operating conditions. A qualitative model of the membrane mechanism was developed based on the diffusion transport of vapour away from the contained liquid surface through the connected pore space. The dispersion undergone by the sample in the GD-FIA system containing this preconcentration unit was also studied and this FIA system was applied as a practical device for the determination and speciation of aluminium in a river water sample. The procedure for generating nitrogen gas involved optimisation of the system parameters including the oxidation reaction step and the production on-line of the chemicals used. The nitrogen gas was generated easily and rapidly, allowing a sample throughput capability of the order of 20 h- 1. The system was applied to the determination of total nitrogen content in agricultural sample prepared by the <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>digestion.</b> The method offered precision and accuracy comparable to those of the standard distillationtitration procedure. Isotope ratios were determined with good precision and means for obtaining accuracy comparable with established techniques were developed. It was also shown that the DPGD-FIA system can be readily adapted to enable different forms of nitrogen e. g. N 02 -, N 03 - and NH 4 + to be determined...|$|R
40|$|Substantial {{clearance}} {{of forests}} and conversion of forest into various land use types contribute to deterioration of soil fertility and associated nutrients loss. Soils from natural and rehabilitated forest in Chikus Forest Reserve and also enrichment planting forest and secondary forest of Tapah Hill Forest Reserve, Perak, Malaysia were selected {{in order to}} assess the influence of land use change on biological properties. This study was carried out to provide fundamental information on soil biological properties and also to compare the differences between natural forest, mono-rehabilitated forest, mixed planting forest and natural regenerated forest (secondary forest). Six subplots (20 Ã 20 m) were established at each study plot and soil samples were collected at the depths of 0 - 15 cm (topsoil) and 15 - 30 cm (subsoil). Soil microbial population was determined using spread-plate technique. Fluorescein Diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis was used to assess the amount of microbial enzymatic activity for each forest plot. Soil Microbial Biomass C (MBC) and N (MBN) were extracted using chloroform fumigation extraction technique and the amount of MBC was determined by dichromate digestion, while MBN via <b>Kjeldahl</b> <b>digestion</b> technique. Soil acidity was determined by pH meter and moisture content was elucidated using gravimetric method. The levels of microbial population of bacterial and fungal at natural significantly exceeded the corresponding values of rehabilitated and secondary forest. However, microbial population is much higher in rehabilitated forest of Tapah Hill compared to that of secondary forest and also Chikus Forest Reserve planted forest which proves that rehabilitation activities do help increase the level of microbial community in the soils. Longer period of time after planting as in enrichment planting compared to mono planting of S. leprosula plantation showed that restoring and recovery of the planted forest needed time. Deforestation activities decrease soil biological activities; however, proper forest management and rehabilitation activities are able to restore the condition of degraded forest land to its original state...|$|R
