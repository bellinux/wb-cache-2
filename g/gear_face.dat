40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop an integrated multibody dynamics computational framework for the deterministic and reliability-based design optimization of wind turbine drivetrains to obtain an optimal wind turbine gear design that ensures a target reliability under wind load and gear manufacturing uncertainties. Gears in wind turbine drivetrains are subjected to severe cyclic loading due to variable wind loads that are stochastic in nature. Thus, the failure rate of drivetrain systems is reported to be relatively higher than the other wind turbine components. It is known in wind energy industry that improving reliability of drivetrain designs is one of the key issues to make wind energy competitive as compared to fossil fuels. Furthermore, a wind turbine is a multi-physics system involving random wind loads, rotor blade aerodynamics, gear dynamics, electromagnetic generator and control systems. This makes an accurate prediction of product life of drivetrains challenging and very limited studies have been carried out regarding design optimization including the reliability-based design optimization (RBDO) of geared systems considering wind load and manufacturing uncertainties. In order to address these essential and challenging issues on design optimization of wind turbine drivetrains under wind load and gear manufacturing uncertainties, the following issues are discussed in this study: (1) development of an efficient numerical procedure for gear dynamics simulation of complex multibody geared systems based on the multi-variable tabular contact search algorithm to account for detailed gear tooth contact geometry with profile modifications or surface imperfections; (2) development of an integrated multibody dynamics computational framework for deterministic and reliability-based design optimization of wind turbine drivetrains using the gear dynamics simulation software developed in (1) and RAMDO software by incorporating wide spatiotemporal wind load uncertainty model, pitting gear tooth contact fatigue model, and rotor blade aerodynamics model using NREL AeroDyn/FAST; and (3) deterministic and reliability-based design optimization of wind turbine drivetrain to minimize total weight of a drivetrain system while ensuring 20 -year reliable service life with wind load and gear manufacturing uncertainties using the numerical procedure developed in this study. To account for the wind load uncertainty, the joint probability density function (PDF) of 10 -minute mean wind speed (V₁₀) and 10 -minute turbulence intensity (I₁₀) is introduced for wind turbine drivetrain dynamics simulation. To consider wide spatiotemporal wind uncertainty (i. e., wind load uncertainty for different locations and in different years), uncertainties of all the joint PDF parameters of V₁₀, I₁₀ and copula are considered, and PDF for each parameter is identified using 249 sets of wind data. This wind uncertainty model allows for the consideration of a wide range of probabilistic wind loads in the contact fatigue life prediction. For a given V₁₀ and I₁₀ obtained from the stochastic wind model, the random time-domain wind speed data is generated using NREL TurbSim, and then inputted into NREL FAST to perform the aerodynamic simulation of rotor blades to predict the transmitted torque and speed of the main shaft of the drivetrain that are sent to the multibody gear dynamics simulation as an input. In order to predict gear contact fatigue life, a high-fidelity gear dynamics simulation model that considers the detailed gear contact geometry as well as the mesh stiffness variation needs to be developed to find the variability of maximum contact stresses under wind load uncertainty. This, however, leads to a computationally intensive procedure. To eliminate the computationally intensive iterative online collision detection algorithm, a numerical procedure for the multibody gear dynamics simulation based on the tabular contact search algorithm is proposed. Look-up contact tables are generated for a pair of gear tooth profiles by the contact geometry analysis prior to the dynamics simulation and the contact points that fulfill the non-conformal contact condition and mesh stiffness at each contact point are calculated for all pairs of gears in the drivetrain model. This procedure allows for the detection of gear tooth contact in an efficient manner while retaining the precise contact geometry and mesh stiffness variation in the evaluation of mesh forces, thereby leading to a computationally efficient gear dynamics simulation suited for the design optimization procedure considering wind load uncertainty. Furthermore, the accuracy of mesh stiffness model introduced in this study and transmission error of gear tooth with tip relief are discussed, and a wind turbine drivetrain model developed using this approach is validated against test data provided in the literature. The gear contact fatigue life is predicted based on the gear tooth pitting fatigue criteria and is defined by the sum of the number of stress cycles required for the fatigue crack initiation and the number required for the crack to propagate from the initial to the critical crack length based on Paris-Erdogan equation for Mode II fracture. All the above procedures are integrated into the reliability-based design optimization software RAMDO for design optimization and reliability analysis of wind turbine drivetrains under wind load and manufacturing uncertainties. A 750 kW GRC wind turbine gearbox model is used to perform the design optimization and the reliability analysis. A deterministic design optimization (DDO) is performed first using an averaged joint PDF of wind load to ensure a 20 -year service life. To this end, <b>gear</b> <b>face</b> width and tip relief (profile modification) are selected as design variables and optimized such that 20 -year fatigue life is ensured while minimizing the total weight of drivetrains. It is important to notice here that an increase in face width leads to a decrease in the fatigue damage, but an increase in total weight. On the other hand, the tip relief has almost no effect on the total weight, but it has a major impact on the fatigue damage. It is shown in this study that the optimum tip relief allows for lowering the greatest maximum shear stresses on the tooth surface without relying heavily on face width widening to meet the 20 -year fatigue life constraint and it leads to reduction of total drivetrain weight by 8. 4 %. However, if only face width is considered as design variable, total weight needs to be increased by 4. 7 % to meet the 20 -year fatigue life constraint. Furthermore, the reliability analysis at the DDO optimum design is carried out considering the large spatiotemporal wind load uncertainty and gear manufacturing uncertainty. Local surrogate models at DDO optimum design are generated using Dynamic Kriging method in RAMDO software to evaluate the gear contact fatigue damage. 49. 5 % reliability is obtained at the DDO optimum design, indicating that the probability of failure is 50. 5 %, which is as expected for the DDO design. RBDO is, therefore, necessary to further improve the reliability of the wind turbine drivetrain. To this end, the sampling-based reliability analysis is carried out to evaluate the probability of failure for each design using the Monte Carlo Simulation (MCS) method. However, the use of a large number of MCS sample points leads to a large number of contact fatigue damage evaluation time using the 10 -minute multibody drivetrain dynamics simulation, resulting in the RBDO calculation process being computational very intensive. In order to overcome the computational difficulty resulting from the use of high-fidelity wind turbine drivetrain dynamics simulation, intermediate surrogate models are created prior to the RBDO process using the Dynamic Kriging method in RAMDO and used throughout the entire RBDO iteration process. It is demonstrated that the RBDO optimum obtained ensures the target 97. 725 % reliability (two sigma quality level) with only 1. 4 % increase in the total weight from the baseline design with 8. 3 % reliability. This result clearly indicates the importance of incorporating the tip relief as a design variable that prevents larger increase in the face width causing an increase in weight. This, however, does not mean that a larger tip relief is always preferred since an optimum tip relief amount depends on stochastic wind loads and an optimum tip relief cannot be found deterministically. Furthermore, accuracy of the RBDO optimum obtained using the intermediate surrogate models is verified by the reliability analysis at the RBDO optimum using the local surrogate models. It is demonstrated that the integrated design optimization procedure developed in this study enables the cost effective and reliable design of wind turbine drivetrains...|$|E

40|$|The use of <b>face</b> <b>gears</b> in an {{advanced}} rotorcraft transmission design was first {{proposed by the}} McDonnell Douglas Helicopter Company during their contracted effort with the U.

This novel gearing arrangement would substantially lower the drive system weight partly because a <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> mesh would be used to split the input power between two output gears. However, the use of <b>face</b> <b>gears</b> and their ability to operate successfully at the speeds and loads required for an aerospace environment was unknown. Therefore a proof-of-concept phase with an existing test stand at the NASA Lewis Research Center was pursued. Hardware was designed that could be tested in Lewis' Spiral Bevel Gear Test Rig. The initial testing indicated that the <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> mesh was a feasible design that could be used at high speeds and load. Surface pitting fatigue was the typical failure mode, and that could lead to tooth fracture. An interim project was conducted to see if slight modifications to the gear tooth geometry or an alternative heat treating process could overcome the surface fatigue problems. From the initial and interim tests, it was apparent that for the surface fatigue problems to be overcome the manufacturing process used for this component would have to be developed to the level used for spiral bevel gears. The current state of the art for <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> manufacturing required using less than optimal gear materials and manufacturing techniques because the surface of the tooth form does not receive final finishing after heat treatment as it does for spiral bevel gears.

Couple of used materials is the hard steel for the worm and the gray cast iron for the wheel. We mention technological conditions for obtaining the worm and the worm wheel. The contact patch completeness check gear flanks results was done on a test stand using training gear on both sides of succession worm knowing the fact that they show different pressure angles.

40|$|The use of <b>face</b> <b>gears</b> in {{helicopter}} transmissions was explored. A light-weight, {{split torque}} transmission design utilizing <b>face</b> <b>gears</b> was described. Face-gear design and geometry were investigated. Topics included tooth generation, limiting {{inner and outer}} radii, tooth contact analysis, contact ratio, gear eccentricity, and structural stiffness. Design charts were developed to determine minimum and maximum face-gear inner and outer radii. Analytical study of transmission error showed face-gear drives were relatively insensitive to gear misalignment, but tooth contact was affected by misalignment. A method of localizing bearing contact to compensate for misalignment was explored. The proper choice of shaft support stiffness enabled good load sharing in the split torque transmission design. Face-gear experimental studies were also included and the feasibility of <b>face</b> <b>gears</b> in high-speed, high-load applications such as helicopter transmissions was demonstrated...|$|R

Because of its small space, high contact ratio, large transmission torque, low vibration and noise, not {{sensitive to the}} axial phase error of the worm and so on, <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> transmission is widely applied. In the traditional gear transmission dynamic contact analysis (TCA), first, simulate the meshing equation; second, calculate the contact trajectory that is formed by the adherent point; last, solve each of the instantaneous contact areas and solve tooth contact region in meshing process. But it can’t solve the tail, diamond and other high contact defects. In the real mesh transmission, tooth meshing is very complex, including edges contact, multi-tooth engagement and many other issues. With {{the progress of the}} times, using finite element analysis software ANSYS, {{it will be able to}} simulate the dynamic contact analysis of the gear. In this paper, the offset <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> as the research object, with MATLAB program, Solidworks and ANSYS software, establish the mathematical model of the orthogonal offset <b>face</b> <b>gear,</b> simulate its geometric model in the three-dimensional software. Finally, implement the simulation of its dynamic contact meshing in the finite element analysis software. Tooth surface equation of the offset face gea...|$|R
40|$|Tests of a 167 Kilowatt (224 Horsepower) {{split torque}} face gearbox were {{performed}} by the Boeing Company in Mesa, Arizona, while working under a Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA) Technology Reinvestment Program (TRP). This paper provides a summary of these cooperative tests, which were jointly funded by Boeing and DARPA. Design, manufacture and testing of the scaled-power TRP proof-of-concept (POC) split torque gearbox followed preliminary evaluations of the concept performed early in the program. The split torque tests were run using 200 N-m (1767 in-lbs) torque input to {{each side of the}} transmission. During tests, two input pinions were slow rolled while in mesh with the two <b>face</b> <b>gears.</b> Two idler gears were also used in the configuration to recombine torque near the output. Resistance was applied at the output <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> to create the required loading conditions in the gear teeth. A system of weights, pulleys and cables were used in the test rig to provide both the input and output loading. Strain gages applied in the tooth root fillets provided strain indication used to determine torque splitting conditions at the input pinions. The final two pinion-two idler tests indicated 52 % to 48 % average torque split capabilities for the two pinions. During the same tests, a 57 % to 43 % average distribution of the torque being recombined to the upper <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> from the lower <b>face</b> <b>gear</b> was measured between the two idlers. The POC split torque tests demonstrated that <b>face</b> <b>gears</b> can be applied effectively in split torque rotorcraft transmissions, yielding good potential for significant weight, cost and reliability improvements over existing equipment using spiral bevel gearing...|$|R
