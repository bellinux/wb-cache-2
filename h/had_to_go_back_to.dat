5|$|Between the December {{meeting and}} second {{gathering}} in March 2011, {{prior to the}} ARG's launch, there was no direct verbal communication between Valve or the developers. Instead, the independent developers spent time, using a shared wiki provided by Valve, to plan out and coordinate the game. They also had to develop the new content for their games, which in most cases was work in addition to existing projects that they were presently undertaking. Others <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> older programming code and re-acquaint themselves with it before undertaking the new additions for the ARG. Valve's Jeep Barnett helped to coordinate the large effort. The second visit to Valve in March 2011 was to affirm {{the plans for the}} launch of the ARG.|$|E
5|$|Veronica asks Beaver {{how she got}} chlamydia—Woody had it, and Beaver {{transmitted}} it to her {{the night}} she was raped (revealing that he, not Duncan, raped her). Beaver is about {{to blow up the}} plane that has both Woody and Keith on it. Beaver pushes a button, and there is a flash in midair. Beaver tases Veronica before Logan appears, having read the text to Mac. The two steal Beaver's gun, and he ends up committing suicide instead of facing the consequences of his actions. Aaron and Kendall (Charisma Carpenter) are in bed, and while she is in the shower, Clarence Weidman (Christopher B. Duncan) appears and shoots him in the head. The scene moves to Australia, where we learn that Duncan organized the murder. Jackie meets Wallace and tells him that she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> New York, where she is actually from, in order to care for her two-year-old son, whom she left with her mother, when she came to Neptune to reconnect with Terrence. Veronica learns that Keith is alive—he was not ever on the plane, but Woody was. Kendall receives $8 million, as Cassidy basically gave her the money as part of her plan. Veronica and Logan (Jason Dohring) rekindle their relationship. Kendall makes Keith a business proposal, and as a result, he misses their plane flight to New York.|$|E

25|$|In an Italian Mickey Mouse story (Topolino E La Piramide Impossible), Mickey and Goofy {{travel back}} in time and by {{accident}} a young boy followed them back to the present. The boy <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> his own time and his memory of the future was erased, but before that he grabbed pieces of books. The boy of course became Nostradamus and the ripped pages from books explained his visions of the future. The story was made by Massimo Marconi and Massimo De Vita.|$|E
25|$|To get Railtrack out of administration, the {{government}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the High Court and present {{evidence that the}} company was no longer insolvent. The principal reason given by {{the government}} to the court for this assertion was the decision of the rail regulator – announced on 22 September 2002 – to carry out an interim review of the company's finances, with the potential to advance significant additional sums to the company. The High Court accepted {{that the company was}} not therefore insolvent, and the railway administration order was discharged on 2 October 2002.|$|E
25|$|After the Spanish–American War {{began in}} April 1898, Allen left from his {{position}} in Germany and by June 1898 was placed in command of Troop D of the 2nd Cavalry Regiment. He then became a major of volunteers and was ordered off to Cuba. He and the volunteers served as scouts and on escort duty during the Santiago Land Campaign. They also fought on July 1, 1898, in the Battle of El Caney. On July 10, Allen {{took control of the}} town and its camp containing over 20,000 refugees. Though there was not adequate food nor medicine, a disaster was averted when Santiago de Cuba surrendered only six days later, allowing the refugees to return to their homes. Allen then developed a case of malaria or yellow fever and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the United States to recover. His service in the war made him highly regarded by Theodore Roosevelt. Roosevelt would later try to make Allen part of a planned division of volunteers during World War I, but the division was never formed.|$|E

25|$|In {{the sixth}} year of her {{confinement}} in the sanatorium Madonna’s younger brother Orby, {{who also had}} tuberculosis, died. He had begged his sister to have their parents take him home from the sanatorium {{so that he could}} die at home. He was taken home and died later the same day. After being denied the opportunity to attend her brother’s funeral, and the thought of dying in the sanatorium added to Madonna’s desire to leave, which she did without permission and returned to her family home. Facing the threat of quarantine her father refused to return Madonna to the Indian sanatorium. Instead he wrote to an old school friend, Henry Standing Bear, who advised them to see a doctor in Pierre and gain admittance to the “white” TB sanatorium, Sanator at Custer, SD. This was not simple, again due to discrimination because they were Indians the authorities denied her admittance to Sanator, telling them that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> the Sioux San. Madonna’s father James Hart Swan would not accept this denial and he gained an audience with the governor of South Dakota, Judge Sigurd Anderson. James Swam explained their situation and the governor, who considered himself somewhat of a pioneer for human rights, understood that American Indians were not treated fairly, arranged for Madonna to be admitted to Sanator.|$|E
500|$|On July 14, 1999, former drummer Gar Samuelson died {{of liver}} failure at age 41 in Orange City, Florida. Three days later, during Megadeth's {{performance}} at Woodstock 1999, Mustaine dedicated [...] "Peace Sells" [...] to Samuelson's memory. That month, Megadeth also recorded a cover {{version of the}} Black Sabbath's [...] "Never Say Die" [...] for the second Nativity in Black tribute album. The band began a world tour in support of Risk in September, playing with Iron Maiden during the European leg. Three months into the tour, Friedman announced his resignation from Megadeth, citing musical differences. Mustaine later said: [...] "I told [...] after Risk that we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> our roots and play metal, and he quit." [...] In January 2000, guitarist Al Pitrelli, formerly of Savatage and the Trans-Siberian Orchestra, became Friedman's replacement.|$|E
500|$|... "Quite a lot, but in {{the sense}} in my {{preparation}} to find the Walter {{that we all know}} now, I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> him right at the beginning to see where he came from. So that process was started before the pilot really, what was this man like before he deteriorated, so I was able to revisit that. Physically, of course, what I had to do was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task. I was aided enormously by my hair and makeup and special effects people here in terms of getting the overall, and indeed wardrobe helped a lot as well. And then we, the shot up through these beautiful lenses that we got a different feel to the episode than we would now. All of those elements work together... to create this version that you see in the episode." ...|$|E

500|$|Grohl {{decided to}} take a two-week period before the QOTSA went on tour to work on the Foo Fighters record, and after {{consulting}} Raskulinecz decided to promote him to producer. First, Grohl visited Hawkins in Topanga to rework the songs that had already been done and show new compositions, such as [...] "Times Like These", [...] "Low", and [...] "Disenchanted Lullaby". Then Grohl and Hawkins went to Virginia to redo the drum, vocal and guitar tracks across a twelve-day period, and Mendel and Shiflett were later called to record their parts in Los Angeles' The Hook Studios, which were mostly done with the supervision of Raskulinecz, as Grohl <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> QOTSA. The only remaining track from the original sessions was [...] "Tired of You", which features a guest appearance by Queen guitarist Brian May. Two of the demos would leak online in 2012, with the other five unreleased demos being leaked on Reddit in 2015.|$|E
500|$|... "Dumpweed" [...] {{kicks off}} the record, and explores sexual frustration. The song is based around the hook [...] "I need a girl that I can train," [...] as in dog training. DeLonge, the song's {{primarily}} lyricist, explains {{the song in}} a 2000 tour booklet: [...] "Girls are so much smarter than guys and can see the future as well as never forget the past. So that leaves the dog as the only thing men are smarter than." [...] The song is a [...] "callow complaint about girls not always doing exactly what you wish they would," [...] and is followed by Hoppus' [...] "Don't Leave Me," [...] a song about a breakup, in irony. Hoppus wrote the song in ten minutes. The guitar swell preceding the second chorus is actually a digital reversal of the delaying guitar preceding it. [...] "Aliens Exist" [...] originates from DeLonge's interest in UFOs and conspiracy theories. [...] "Going Away to College" [...] was written in ten minutes by Hoppus while at home sick on Valentine's Day 1999. While watching the movie Can't Hardly Wait, Hoppus {{began to think about}} [...] "how much it sucks when people are in love in high school" [...] and are forced to be separated after graduation by different colleges in different cities. Since it was recorded late in production, the band <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> Los Angeles to record Barker's drum track.|$|E

2500|$|Wynette {{attended}} Tremont High School, {{where she}} was an all-star basketball player. A month before graduation, several months before her 18th birthday, she wed her first husband, Euple Byrd. He was a construction worker, but had trouble keeping a job, and they moved several times. Wynette worked as a waitress, a receptionist, and a barmaid, and also in a shoe factory. In 1963, she attended beauty college in Tupelo, Mississippi, where she learned to be a hairdresser.

2500|$|Thurber's {{behavior}} {{became increasingly}} erratic and unpredictable {{in his last}} year.

Thurber was stricken with a blood clot on the brain on October 4, 1961, and underwent emergency surgery, drifting {{in and out of}} consciousness. [...] The operation was successful, but he died, aged 66, due to complications from pneumonia. The doctors said his brain was senescent from several small strokes and hardening of the arteries. His last words, aside from the repeated word [...] "God", were [...] "God bless... God damn", according to his wife, Helen.|$|E
2500|$|The {{alternate}} {{version was}} leaked {{on the internet}} via Napster and other methods in the early 2000s, and was also played infrequently on some radio stations. According to then-member of the Boys' backing band, Tommy Smith, the album version is the [...] "original version"; the alternate version was recorded because the chorus of the album version did not make sense. In an interview with HitQuarters, Andreas Carlsson confessed that the song was a play with words. According to him, [...] "When Max {{came up with the}} original idea for the song, it already had the line 'you are my fire, the one desire'. We tried a million different variations on the second verse, and finally we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> what was sounding so great, 'you are my fire, the one desire'. And then we changed it to 'am I your fire, your one desire', which made absolutely no sense in combination with the chorus - but everybody loved it!." ...|$|E
