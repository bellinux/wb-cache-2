5|$|Myosin {{regulatory}} {{light chain}} 2, ventricular/cardiac muscle <b>isoform</b> (MLC-2) {{also known as}} the regulatory light chain of myosin (RLC) is a protein that in humans is encoded by the MYL2 gene. This cardiac ventricular RLC <b>isoform</b> is distinct from that expressed in skeletal muscle (MYLPF), smooth muscle (MYL12B) and cardiac atrial muscle (MYL7).|$|E
5|$|The {{infectious}} <b>isoform</b> of PrP, {{known as}} PrPSc, {{is able to}} convert normal PrPC proteins into the infectious <b>isoform</b> by changing their conformation, or shape; this, in turn, alters the way the proteins interconnect. PrPSc always causes prion disease. Although the exact 3D structure of PrPSc is not known, it has {{a higher proportion of}} β-sheet structure in place of the normal α-helix structure. Aggregations of these abnormal isoforms form highly structured amyloid fibers, which accumulate to form plaques. It is unclear as to whether these aggregates are the cause of cell damage or are simply a side-effect of the underlying disease process. The end of each fiber acts as a template onto which free protein molecules may attach, allowing the fiber to grow. Under most circumstances, only PrP molecules with an identical amino acid sequence to the infectious PrPSc are incorporated into the growing fiber. However, rare cross-species transmission is also possible.|$|E

5|$|Although {{many of the}} afore-mentioned inhibitors {{share the}} same Hsp90 binding site (either N- or C-terminal), {{it has been shown}} that some of these drugs {{preferentially}} access distinct Hsp90 populations, which are differentiated by the extent of their post-translational modification. Though no published inhibitor has yet to distinguish between Hsp90A and Hsp90B, a recent study has shown that phosphorylation of a particular residue in the Hsp90 N-terminus can provide <b>isoform</b> specificity to inhibitor binding., thus providing an additional level of regulation for optimal Hsp90 targeting.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Due to {{alternative}} splicing events in eukaryotic species, {{the identification of}} mRNA <b>isoforms</b> (or splicing variants) is a difficult problem. Traditional experimental methods for this purpose are time consuming and cost ineffective. The emerging RNA-Seq technology provides a possible effective method to address this problem. Although the advantages of RNA-Seq over traditional methods in transcriptome analysis have been confirmed by many studies, the inference of <b>isoforms</b> from millions of short sequence reads (e. g., Illumina/Solexa reads) has remained computationally challenging. In this work, we propose a method to calculate the expression levels of <b>isoforms</b> and infer <b>isoforms</b> from short RNA-Seq reads using exon-intron boundary, transcription start site (TSS) and poly-A site (PAS) information. We first formulate the relationship among exons, <b>isoforms,</b> and single-end reads as a convex quadratic program, and then use an efficient algorithm (called IsoInfer) to search for <b>isoforms.</b> IsoInfer can calculate the expression levels of <b>isoforms</b> accurately if all the <b>isoforms</b> are known and infer novel <b>isoforms</b> from scratch. Our experimental tests on known mouse <b>isoforms</b> with both simulated expression levels and reads demonstrate that IsoInfer is able to calculate the expression levels of <b>isoforms</b> with an accuracy comparable to the state-of-the-art statistical method and a 60 times faster speed. Moreover, our tests on both simulated and real reads show that it achieves a good precision and sensitivity in inferring <b>isoforms</b> when given accurate exon-intron boundary, TSS and PAS information, especially for <b>isoforms</b> whose expression levels are significantly high. ...|$|R

5|$|In 1991, the amyloid {{hypothesis}} {{postulated that}} extracellular amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits are the fundamental {{cause of the}} disease. Support for this postulate comes from {{the location of the}} gene for the amyloid precursor protein (APP) on chromosome 21, together with the fact that people with trisomy 21 (Down Syndrome) who have an extra gene copy almost universally exhibit at least the earliest symptoms of AD by 40years of age. Also, a specific <b>isoform</b> of apolipoprotein, APOE4, is a major genetic risk factor for AD. While apolipoproteins enhance the breakdown of beta amyloid, some isoforms are not very effective at this task (such as APOE4), leading to excess amyloid buildup in the brain. Further evidence comes from the finding that transgenic mice that express a mutant form of the human APP gene develop fibrillar amyloid plaques and Alzheimer's-like brain pathology with spatial learning deficits.|$|E
5|$|<b>Isoform</b> “a” {{of human}} CASS4 is {{considered}} the predominant species, and at 786 amino acids is the longest one. Amino acid sequence homology of this <b>isoform</b> of human CASS4 with other family members is 26% overall identity and 42% similarity. Using a yeast two-hybrid approach, the CASS4 protein SH3 domain was shown {{to interact with the}} FAK C-terminus, despite the lowest overall similarity to other SH3 domains in the CAS group. In addition, human CASS4 has a limited number of candidate SH2-binding sites, estimated at 10, which is similar to EFS (estimated at 9) and in contrast to p130Cas/BCAR1 and NEDD9, which have 20 and 18 respectively. The CASS4 C-terminus has a short region of CAS family homology, but lacks obvious similarity at the level of primary amino acid sequence. It also lacks a YDYVHL sequence at the N-terminal end of the FAT-like carboxy-terminal domain, even though this motif is conserved among the other three CAS family proteins and is an important binding site for the Src SH2 domain. Although this lack of sequence similarity may mean a reduced functionality of the CASS4 protein, molecular modeling analysis performed by Singh and colleagues using p130CAS/BCAR1 structures as templates suggested an almost identical fold between CASS4 and p130CAS/BCAR1 within their SH3 domains, and substantial similarity within 432-591 residues of CASS4 and 449-610 residues of p130Cas/BCAR1 at the level of secondary and tertiary structures. Also, the similar periodicity of α-helices and β-sheets in both CASS4 and p130Cas/BCAR1 provides another confirmation for the idea of well-conserved structures within the family members.|$|E

40|$|Over {{the last}} decade {{substantial}} {{progress has been made}} in the identification of <b>isoforms</b> of P-type ATPase subunits. Of the P-type ATPases characterized, only the four cx subunit <b>isoforms</b> of Na,K-ATPasel or the two a subunit <b>isoforms</b> of the closely related enzyme H,K-ATPase 2 are known to associate with p subunits. To date, studies investigating the existence of P-type ATPase p subunit <b>isoforms</b> have resulted in the identification of five p subunit <b>isoforms</b> (designated pl, p 2, p 3, H,K p, and pbl) in different specie^. ^ However, unlike the Na,K-ATPase or H,K-ATPase a subunit <b>isoforms</b> which share relatively high levels of amino acid homology (> 60 %), the amino acid sequences of p subunit <b>isoforms</b> share much lower levels of homology, sometimes as low as 30 %.

Here we investigated the expression, distribution, regulation and role of Bim <b>isoforms</b> in HCC cells. Fifteen Bim <b>isoforms</b> were identified in HCC, with six newly identified <b>isoforms</b> and two newly identified exons. Among of them, Bim EL, L, S, a 1, a 2, a 3, b 2, b 4 and b 6 are abundant <b>isoforms</b> according to their mRNA levels. However only Bim EL, L and S proteins could be clearly detected. Bim mRNA and protein were strongly expressed in HCC tissues compared to relevant non-tumorous regions, but the ratio of variant <b>isoforms</b> showed no difference between tumorous and non-tumorous tissues. Bim <b>isoforms</b> were differentially regulated after chemotherapeutic drug 5 -Fluorouracil (5 -FU) treatment. Interestingly, Bim EL, L and S, the <b>isoforms</b> known to induce apoptosis strongly, are the least inducible <b>isoforms</b> at their mRNA levels when exposed to the stress, suggesting that post-transcriptional rather than transcriptional, modulations may play a role to enhance their functions. Finally, overexpression of Bim EL, L, S and all alpha <b>isoforms</b> induced apoptosis in HCC cells, while overexpression of Bim beta <b>isoforms</b> showed no effects on cell survival after 5 -FU treatment. In conclusion, Bim alpha <b>isoforms</b> appears to have a role in the regulation of apoptosis in HCC cells, which may contribute to not only the growth of tumor cells but also the sensitivity of HCC cells to chemotherapy...|$|R
