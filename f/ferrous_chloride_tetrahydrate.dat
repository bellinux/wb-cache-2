40|$|Wrought iron with a {{remaining}} metallic core {{recovered from}} marine and terrestrial archaeological contexts is unstable {{and has the}} potential for further corrosion after recovery or excavation. Where metallic iron remains within the object, it deteriorates as crystals of new, chloride-bearing, corrosion products form at the metal/corrosion interface, resulting in the loss of overlying corrosion. This is undesirable, for the information on the form of the original, uncorroded, artefact is commonly found within the overlying corrosion which is detached. A mechanism for this type of deterioration, based upon the retention of chloride counter-ions as part of the electrochemical corrosion process, was identified by Turgoose (1982) for archaeological iron and his research has informed the storage of chloride-contaminated wrought iron in museum collections ever since: Iron corrodes in the presence of <b>ferrous</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>tetrahydrate</b> but not its dihydrate.

40|$|Liquid {{catalysts}} for decomposing {{hydrogen peroxide}} in rocket engines have certain advantages over conventional gauzes or pellets.

Against this background, the authors have investigated the feasibility of using different liquid agents to achieve the rapid decomposition needed for use in both monopropellant and bipropellant rocket applications.

40|$|Microscale ejector pumps {{offer the}} {{potential}} for high flow rate pumping of gases, a functionality that is greatly needed in MEMS technology. These pumps have many additional characteristics, such as their simplicity of design and their lack of moving parts, which favor them over other state-of-the-art MEMS gas pumps. One of the challenges associated with driving ejector pumps, however, is providing a compact source of motive fluid. This fluid is the high-speed gas that drives the pumping action. The current thesis presents a MEMS device capable of generating steam at speeds suitable for driving an ejector pump in a compact fashion. To that end, the device utilizes the homogeneous catalytic decomposition of hydrogen peroxide. Analysis shows that a MEMS ejector pump driven by this device is capable of handling mass flow rates per unit pump volume {{on the order of}} 10 - 2 g/s/cm 3, which are two orders of magnitude higher than those of state-of-the art MEMS gas pumps. In addition to pumping, the steam generator may also be used for microrocket thrust generation in micropropulsion applications. In this thesis, the design, fabrication, testing, and successful demonstration of the MEMS steam generator are presented. The device consists of a mixing section for the peroxide and catalyst streams, a reactor section where the peroxide decomposes, and finally a nozzle section where the gaseous products of the decomposition are accelerated to the required velocities. To design the device, multidomain (chemical, thermal, and fluidic) numerically-implemented modeling is used to study the underlying physics and arrive at an optimized, microfabricatable design. The modeling takes into account the key challenges of thermal management, achieving fast mixing, and boundary layer compensation. The device is then fabricated from a stack of four silicon wafers and one Pyrex wafer using deep reactive ion etching and wafer bonding. The modeling also guides the design of a micabased ceramic package which provides both thermal insulation and piping ports. The system is then experimentally tested using high-test hydrogen peroxide and <b>ferrous</b> <b>chloride</b> <b>tetrahydrate</b> solution as the catalyst. The overall initial peroxide mass fraction is varied between 83 % and 71 %. The device is characterized using temperature measurements, refractive index analysis, and visual inspection during operation. Successful performance is demonstrated via the full decomposition of the peroxide and the complete vaporization of the water produced. The experimental results are also compared with those from the simulation. Good agreement is observed between experiment and theory, providing comprehensive model verification. The realization and demonstration of this steam generator promise significant enhancements in MEMS technology, particularly in the fields of gas pumping and micropropulsion. by Feras Eid. Thesis (Ph.
