40|$|Remote {{observations}} of Mars have led scientists {{to believe that}} its early climate {{was similar to that}} of the early Earth, having had abundant liquid water and a dense atmosphere. One of the most fascinating questions of recent times is whether simple bacterial life developed on Mars (as it did on the Earth) during this early element period. Analyses of SNC meteorites have broadened considerably our knowledge of the chemistry of certain types of Martian rocks, underscoring the tantalizing possibility of early hydrothermal systems and even of ancient bacterial life. Detailed analyses of SNC meteorites in Terrestrial laboratories utilize the most sophisticated organic, isotopic and microscopic techniques in existence. Indeed; it is unlikely that the key biogenic indicators used in McKay et al (ibid) could be identified by a remote instrument on the surface of Mars. As a result, it is probable that any robotic search for evidence of an ancient Martian biosphere will have as its focus the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> <b>minerals</b> in likely host rocks rather than the direct detection of organic or isotopic biomarkers. Even on a sample return mission, mineralogical screening will be utilized to choose the most likely candidate rocks. X-ray diffraction (XRD) is the only technique that can provide a direct determination of the crystal structures of the phases present within a sample. When many different crystalline phases are present, quantitative analysis is better constrained if used in conjunction with a determination of elemental composition, obtainable by X-ray fluorescence (XRF) using the same X-ray source as for XRD. For planetary surface analysis, a remote instrument combining XRD and XRF could be used for mineralogical characterization of both soils and rocks. We are designing a remote XRD/XRF instrument with this objective in mind. The instrument concept pays specific attention to constraints in sample preparation, weight, volume, power, etc. Based on the geometry of a pinhole camera (transmission geometry, flat two-dimensional detector perpendicular to the direct beam), the instrument (which we call CHEMIN, for Chemistry and Mineralogy) uses an X-ray sensitive CCD detector which will allow concurrent positional and energy-dispersive analysis of collected photons. Thus XRF (energy) and XRD (geometry) analysis of transmitted X-rays will be performed at the same time. Tests performed with single minerals and simple mixtures give promising results. Refinements of the prototype promise interpretable results on complex samples...|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{procedure}} is described for finding sets <b>of</b> <b>key</b> {{players in a}} social network.

KPP-POS {{is defined as the}} <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> players for the purpose of optimally diffusing something through the network by using the key players as seeds. KPP-NEG is defined as the <b>identification</b> <b>of</b> <b>key</b> players for the purpose of disrupting or fragmenting the network by removing the key nodes. It is found that off-the-shelf centrality measures are not optimal for solving either generic problem, and therefore new measures are presented...|$|R
