Together, these were a prerequisite for the evolution of the most complex eukaryotic cells, from which all multicellular organisms are built.|$|E

Virgin Media signed an agreement with Cable & Wireless to become the unbundled local loop (LLU) network provider, providing access to 4million homes outside of the Virgin Media cable franchise network and would include linear pay broadcast channels and video on demand. This was originally scheduled to be released during 2008 but was delayed and scaled back as Virgin Media concentrated on improving its cable broadband proposition <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> competing with Sky in the premium television market.

Ribbentrop's friendship with Papen, which went back to 1918, ended over this issue. At the same time, Ribbentrop took to shouting at the Turkish Ambassador in Berlin, Mehemet Hamdi Arpag, {{as part of the}} effort to win Turkey over as a German ally. Ribbentrop believed that Turks were so stupid that only by shouting at them could one make them understand. One of the consequences of Ribbentrop's heavy-handed behaviour was the signing of the Anglo-Turkish alliance of 12 May 1939.|$|E

25|$|Fendt, {{part of the}} AGCO corporation, {{has also}} {{been working on a}} driverless tractor. In 2011 in Hanover at the Agritechnica show, Fendt {{presented}} their driverless tractor model called the GuideConnect. The GuideConnect is a tractor programmed to mirror the movements of another tractor. An operator-driven tractor maneuvers through a field or through crops and is followed by a driverless tractor. Because the first tractor has a driver, he or she can manually steer to avoid obstacles with the driverless tractor following. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> a completely independent piece of technology, Fendt made GuideConnect to work together with operator-controlled machinery.

500|$|As a result, {{when the}} cast {{returned}} to begin filming the series' fourth season in September 1975, there were {{major changes in}} both the makeup and {{the direction of the}} show: The more earnest and faithful family man Captain B.J.

Another change to the composition of the show occurred in the elevation of longtime recurring guest cast member Jamie Farr, who played Corporal Maxwell Q. Klinger, to the regular cast, with his name being featured on the opening credits. Episodes following this represented a major change in focus for the show: The individual effects and psychological damages of war were explored more, often in parallel to the ending of the Vietnam War, and the Korean culture was portrayed in greater depth than had been done before, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> a [...] "boorish, military mindset" [...] as before.|$|E
500|$|The {{dictator}} {{novel is}} a genre {{that has developed}} {{as a vehicle for}} Latin American writers to critique concentrated authority. Assistant Professor of Spanish at Walsh University, Jorge J Barrueto, argues that [...] has been heralded as epitomizing dictatorship, [...] "a phenomenon perceived to be a natural and inherent trait in the region". According to Garcia Calderon, the legacy of colonialism in Latin America has often led to the rise of an absolute authority, which seeks to contain a nation's inner conflict. Once in power, the man in charge often seeks complete control; he often amends constitutions, dismantling laws which previously prevented his re-election. For example, in 1899 General Manuel Estrada Cabrera altered the Guatemalan Constitution which had previously prohibited his re-election. Typically, however, dictator novels attempt to examine the abstract nature of authority figures and to question the idea of authority in general <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>focusing</b> <b>on</b> the rule of a particular dictator.|$|E

This paper explores why human variation is such an attractive and productive object particularly for the life sciences. It proposes that knowledge about human variation is incomplete in a promising way, and that it is of high instrumental value in the life sciences. I briefly illustrate the main points with an exemplary case, namely, population genetic studies of 'Roma'...|$|R
