These included the introduction of income tax and death duties which would leave the finances of the Brownlow family severely depleted.|$|E

A brief threat, {{in the shape of}} the German Type XXI and Type XIII emerged, too late to alter the outcome. The Allies held the technological edge from 1943 onward. Official wartime operations ceased at midnight on 4 June 1945. The last mission was flown by Wing Commander J. Barret DFC, GOC No. 201 Squadron RAF. By that time over 2,000 decorations had been awarded. These included four Victoria Crosses, 17 George Medals, and 82 Distinguished Service Orders.|$|E
5|$|Kartik {{played in}} ten {{first-class}} matches for Middlesex, taking 33 wickets at 22.87. He took his season's innings best of 5/65 and then 2/26 {{in the season}} opener against cross-London rivals Surrey, and then took 3/32 and 4/53 in a hard-fought 47-run win over Kent, {{and a total of}} 6/139 in the next match against Essex, but his season fell away at the end, managing only six wickets <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> matches. With the bat, he made 336 runs at 24.00, the most prolific season of his career with the willow, including 62 against Essex and 57 not out against Gloucestershire. He played in a solitary one-dayer, taking 2/19 against Northamptonshire.|$|E
5|$|With a 24-match unbeaten run in Serie A, Roma {{became the}} only challengers to Inter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> rounds for the league title that season, {{ultimately}} finishing runners-up after the final game. Despite suffering several injury problems, he surpassed former prolific strikers such as Gabriel Batistuta, Giuseppe Signori, and Kurt Hamrin, putting him in sixth place in the all-time Serie A scoring records. Totti also played in the Coppa Italia final against Inter on 5 May 2010, but received a red card in the closing minutes {{of the second half}} for kicking Mario Balotelli; Roma lost the match 0–1, thus failing to bring home a record tenth Coppa Italia title.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the match}} results were {{encouraging}} {{for such a}} young and inexperienced team, Craig scored only 103runs at 14.71. Despite his contributions as a leader, this was not up to standard. He had trouble with his defence, being bowled eight times in 17innings. In the 12 matches <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> months of the tour, Craig passed fifty only once in 13 innings. However, the selectors {{did not have to}} reverse their youth policy: Craig contracted a bout of hepatitis {{before the start of the}} 1958–59 season. He returned to cricket at the beginning of the season, but was underprepared, scoring two ducks in his only two innings of the season, the second coming against the touring England team. Craig declared that he was not ready for a return to Test cricket and relinquished the captaincy, which the selectors handed to Benaud. Benaud went on to defeat England 4–0; as England were widely regarded as the best team at the time, this established him as captain of a resurgent Australia.|$|E
5|$|China {{won their}} fifth {{gold medal in}} the women's event and the first since 2004 after winning the silver medal <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> Olympiads. They scored 20 match points with nine wins and two draws, {{finishing}} three points ahead of Poland and Ukraine who scored 17 match points each. Poland won the silver medal after winning the tie-breaker with Ukraine. The defending champions from the previous three Olympiads Russia finished without a medal on the fourth place after losing the decisive match for the gold medal against China in the final round. Vietnam, Azerbaijan and Israel have all surprised positively, finishing on the seventh, eighth and the ninth place, respectively. The teams that disappointed with their place in the final standings include Georgia, Bulgaria, Hungary, Romania, Germany, Spain and Turkey.|$|E

The brothers had previously had little success in partnerships together for Victoria and in the match against South Africa, Neil came in to join Raywho was playing as an openerwith the score at 2/21. The pair put on 96 runs. The Victorians drew the match and the brothers did not bat together in the second innings. In the match against South Australia, Neil joined his brother at 1/118 and the Harveys again narrowly missed a century partnership, as Ray fell at 2/211 for 121. Later, Neil was out for 95, missing out on another milestone. Mick was not selected for his adopted state in any fixture for the entire season and did not meet his brothers.|$|E

Chicago posted the then-earliest lead in Super Bowl history when {{returner}} Devin Hester ran back the opening kickoff 92 {{yards for a}} touchdown after 14 seconds had elapsed (a record later broken in Super Bowl XLVIII when the Seattle Seahawks scored a safety 12 seconds into the game). The Colts forced five turnovers, including cornerback Kelvin Hayden's 56-yard interception return for a touchdown. Indianapolis kicker Adam Vinatieri also scored three field goals. Colts quarterback Peyton Manning was named the game's Most Valuable Player (MVP), completing 25 of 38 passes for 247yards and a touchdown, with one interception for a passer rating of 81.8.|$|E

Technological answers to the Type XXI were available in the form of 3-centimetre radar and magnetic anomaly detectors in aircraft. At midnight 4 June 1945, official wartime operations ceased. The last mission was flown by Wing Commander J. Barret DFC, commanding officer of No. 201 Squadron RAF. By that time over 2,000 decorations had been awarded. These included four Victoria Crosses, of whom only one survived the war, 17 George Medals, and 82 Distinguished Service Orders.|$|E
5|$|Jones was {{selected}} by the Chicago Cardinals of the National Football League (NFL) with the second pick in the 1946 NFL Draft, but did not sign with the team as he pondered returning to LSU to finish his studies. When the Miami Seahawks of the new All-America Football Conference (AAFC) offered him a $12,000 contract, however, he accepted it and joined the team. The Seahawks won just three games in 1946, the AAFC's first season of play, and Jones was traded along with two other players to the Brooklyn Dodgers, another AAFC team, in December. The Seahawks, meanwhile, folded and were moved to Baltimore after the season because of poor attendance and shaky finances. Jones played sparingly for the Dodgers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> games of the 1946 season, rushing for 62 yards on 19 carries.|$|E

5|$|Native Silver perch and {{introduced}} brown trout were released in 1981–83 and 1987–89 respectively, {{but have not}} been stocked since. Silver perch stockings resulted in almost no captures. Introduced rainbow trout have been released sporadically, approximately once a decade, but have not been released since 2002–04, due to unacceptably low survival rates. According to a government report, {{the reason for the}} low survival rate is unknown, but the dominance of carp in the competition for food is one suggested theory. However, the eutrophic nature and high water temperatures of the lake in summer are more probable reasons. Golden perch and Murray cod have accounted for around four fifths of the released fish <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> decades and have been the only fish stocked in the last five years. The government plans to stock only these two species for the five years leading up to 2014.|$|E

He then played in all 14 of Punjab's round-robin matches in the 2009 Indian Premier League held in South Africa, taking 17 wickets at 22.94 with an economy rate of 7.74, and scored 196 runs at 19.60. He started strongly, taking nine wickets in four matches {{in the early stages}} of the tournament, before taking only two in the next five matches, and ending with six <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>three</b> fixtures.

The New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade evacuated 316 cases and the 2nd Light Horse Brigade had 57 cases, many of whom suffered a high fever of 105° to 106°F. More than 700 cases of mostly malignant malaria were reported during the first 12 days of October, and the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade lost about one third of its strength. Of the approximately 5,000 New Zealanders, about 3,000 were either in hospital or in convalescent depots, mostly with malaria.|$|E
