60|$|These gentlemen {{complain}} of hardship. No considerable number shows discontent; but, {{in order to}} give satisfaction to any number of respectable men, who come in so decent and constitutional a mode before us, let us examine a little what that hardship <b>is.</b> <b>They</b> <b>want</b> to be preferred clergymen in the Church of England as by law established; but their consciences will not suffer them to conform to the doctrines and practices of that Church: that <b>is,</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to be teachers in a church to which they do not belong; and it is an odd sort of hardship. They want to receive the emoluments appropriated for teaching one set of doctrines, whilst they are teaching another. A church, in any legal sense, is only a certain system of religious doctrines and practices fixed and ascertained by some law,--by the difference of which laws different churches (as different commonwealths) are made {{in various parts of the}} world; and the establishment is a tax laid by the same sovereign authority for payment of those who so teach and so practise: for no legislature was ever so absurd as to tax its people to support men for teaching and acting as they please, but by some prescribed rule.|$|E

Less than the JND is wasted effort because the improvement will not be perceived; more than the JND is again wasteful because it reduces the level of repeat sales.

5000|$|By {{the end of}} the summer, Denry {{has made}} a {{substantial}} profit from the sightseers, which he uses to finance his boldest venture. He starts up the Five Towns Universal Thrift Club. Members deposit money little by little; once they have accumulated half the sum they need to purchase whatever it <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>want,</b> the club allows them to buy on credit, but only from stores associated with the club. Denry makes money by getting a discount from the vendors in return for access to his large customer base. When his capital starts to run out, he arranges an [...] "accident" [...] for the Countess's coach. He drives conveniently by and gives her a lift to an urgent appointment.

Confronted with the necessity of making a immediate decision, they are not able to analyze or search - for the one hundredth time - deep inside their meticulously developed reasoning, with respect to their interests, caprices and desires, regarding the injustice suffered in the hands of others. At the same time obeying the emotional suggestion of the collective, their ideas burst into several representations, but {{no more than a few}} manage becoming consistent before the new images are formed, images of the righteousness and greater strength of the group, palpable deeds of their own belonging to the collective, the first elements of pride and initial sensations of sweet victory."

5000|$|The Wildwood Institute for STEM Research and Development (WISRD) was {{launched}} {{in the fall of}} 2014. Wildwood's Institute Model brings together students with deep passions in particular areas of academic interest. Student scholars enrolled in Institutes decide what it <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to learn and are charged with developing their own individualized learning outcomes. Coached by Wildwood teachers and supported by outside mentors in their fields of study, students figure out how to acquire knowledge. The Institute Model is a hallmark program for teaching and learning in Wildwood's middle and upper school that provides a framework for the best ways for students to develop skills necessary for 21st-century success: Mastering content, risk-taking, problem-solving, critical thinking, collaboration, and navigating uncomfortable situations with comfort. Two additional Institutes are planned: Institute for Digital Design and Entrepreneurship and the Social Good and Community Leadership Institute. In 2015, Wildwood received a matching grant in support of the Institute Model from the prestigious Edward E. Ford Foundation.|$|E
50|$|Rancière's book, The Ignorant Schoolmaster: Five Lessons in Intellectual Emancipation (original title Le Maître ignorant: Cinq leçons sur l'émancipation intellectuelle, {{published}} in 1987) {{was written for}} educators and educators-to-be. Through the story of Joseph Jacotot, Rancière challenges his readers to consider equality {{as a starting point}} rather than a destination. In doing so, he asks educators to abandon the themes and rhetoric of cultural deficiency and salvation. Rather than requiring informed schoolmasters to guide students towards prescribed and alienating ends, Rancière argues that educators can channel the equal intelligence in all to facilitate their intellectual growth in virtually unlimited directions. The schoolmaster need not know anything (and may be ignorant). Rancière begins with the premises that all are of equal intelligence and that any collective educational exercise founded on this principle can provide the insights from which knowledge is constructed. He claims that the poor and disenfranchised should feel perfectly able to teach themselves whatever it <b>is</b> <b>they</b> <b>want</b> to know. Furthermore, anyone can lead, and the oppressed should not feel bound to experts or reliant on others for their intellectual emancipation.|$|E
