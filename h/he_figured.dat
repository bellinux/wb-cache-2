5|$|Kerry Conran {{grew up on}} {{films and}} comic books of the 1930s and 1940s. He and his brother, Kevin, were {{encouraged}} by their parents to develop their creative side at a young age. Kerry studied at a feeder program for Disney animators at CalArts, and became interested in 2-D computer animation. While there, he {{realized that it was}} possible to apply some of the techniques associated with animation to live-action. Conran had been out of film school for two years and was trying to figure out how to make a movie. <b>He</b> <b>figured</b> that Hollywood would never take a chance on an inexperienced, first-time filmmaker, so he decided to make the movie himself.|$|E
5|$|O'Neill {{became an}} {{assistant}} professor at Princeton in 1956, and was promoted to associate professor in 1959. He visited Stanford University in 1957 to meet with Professor Wolfgang K. H. Panofsky. This resulted in a collaboration between Princeton and Stanford to build the Colliding Beam Experiment (CBX). With a US$800,000 grant from the Office of Naval Research, construction on the first particle storage rings began in 1958 at the Stanford High-Energy Physics Laboratory. <b>He</b> <b>figured</b> out how to capture the particles and, by pumping the air out to produce a vacuum, store them long enough to experiment on them. CBX stored its first beam on March 28, 1962. O'Neill became a full professor of physics in 1965.|$|E
5|$|The vault at Pinchbeck's work is emptied and {{the money}} is found above Alvarez' bar. Later Mulder and Scully confront LaBonge and Maleeni as they are {{released}} on bail, where Mulder explains that <b>he</b> <b>figured</b> out their plan - LaBonge and Pinchbeck were not, in fact, enemies, {{and that they had}} been working together to put Alvarez in prison for making LaBonge's life miserable in prison 8 years prior, and that, as masters of sleight of hand and escape tricks, the two of them easily escaped, performed the robbery, and returned to their cells before being noticed.|$|E

5|$|Cotto and Judah {{delivered}} an all-action brawl, {{but after}} weathering some difficult early rounds as <b>he</b> <b>figured</b> out Judah's southpaw style and adjusted to his speed, Cotto {{took over the}} bout. In round seven, both fighters went toe-to-toe and in round eight he hurt Judah several times. In round nine, Judah took a knee to gain a breather from Cotto's aggressive style. By the tenth round, Judah was bleeding from a cut over his right eye and was hurt by an uppercut from Cotto that sent him retreating to the ropes, but Judah stayed upright. Early in the eleventh round, Cotto landed a combination that dropped Judah to the canvas. He managed {{to get to his}} feet, but Cotto went after Judah with a relentless attack, turning him sideways along the ropes as he continued to throw punches. That forced the referee to stop the fight.|$|E

25|$|The {{death in}} London, of Mr John O'Connor Power recalls the earlier {{days of the}} land agitation, when <b>he</b> <b>figured,</b> as MP for Mayo, with Parnell and Biggar in their famous {{obstruction}} tactics in Parliament, {{and was one of}} those suspended after the great scenes in 1881 arising out of Davitt's arrest.|$|E
25|$|The {{business}} {{was a struggle}} at first, however in ten years' time he had sharpened his skills to perfection. <b>He</b> <b>figured</b> {{out how to make}} his machinery fabricate the wooden pencils efficiently in the old textile factory, creating the first and the most successful pencil company in the United States. Munroe took the lead in manufacturing pencils in the United States from that time forward {{as long as he was}} in the pencil business. He also make ever-pointed-pencil leads that were very popular.|$|E
25|$|Gauss {{was a child}} prodigy. A contested story relates that, when he was eight, <b>he</b> <b>figured</b> out how to add up all {{the numbers}} from 1 to 100. There are many other anecdotes about his {{precocity}} while a toddler, and {{he made his first}} ground-breaking mathematical discoveries while still a teenager. He completed Disquisitiones Arithmeticae, his magnum opus, in 1798 at the age of 21, although it was not published until 1801. This work was fundamental in consolidating number theory as a discipline and has shaped the field to the present day.|$|E

25|$|Following preparatory school Ross boarded at Haileybury where, {{being both}} small {{for his age}} and a latecomer to his year, he {{initially}} suffered greatly from bullying — to his intense relief the bully {{was killed in a}} vacation cycling accident — but his stock quickly rose when he revealed a talent which matched his passion for cricket. With a hint of the debonair style that was to characterise his life, he avoided participation in the OTC and all study of mathematics and science, instead enjoying art, French poetry and racquet sports. As a senior boy he was caned for making an unlicensed visit to Wimbledon; it was his misfortune that <b>he</b> <b>figured,</b> smoking a cigarette, in a photograph of spectators carried in his headmaster's newspaper the following morning.|$|E
25|$|Straight away Munroe {{obtained}} a few lumps of black graphite which he beat to a pulp with a hammer. He separated the fine particles that floated {{to the top}} of the water with a spoon and mixed them with a clay solution. His first experiments with this lead solution was not very successful. He continued making cabinet maker’s squares and sold the few of these which he could. In this time he continued experimenting with graphite lead for pencils with little accomplishment. He had no knowledge of the subject and feared consulting others as they might take the idea and produce pencils themselves. Munroe continued experimenting in secret with graphite powder formulas on his own. Eventually <b>he</b> <b>figured</b> a way to come up with a suitable graphite paste formula of various ingredients that could be poured into a slotted line made in some cedar wood blanks. The pencil centers would be his secret formula of a mixture of dried graphite paste of clay and other unknown ingredients. They were air dried and not hardened by firing in a furnace as Europeans did, so the quality was not as good as theirs—but it was fine enough to write with.|$|E
25|$|He succeeded {{equally in}} showing {{the paths of}} the planets when they come near or {{withdraw}} from the earth. He fashioned first an armillary sphere. He joined the two circles called by the Greeks coluri and by the Latins incidentes because they fell upon each other, and at their extremities he placed the poles. He drew with great art and accuracy, across the colures, five other circles called parallels, which, from one pole to the other, divided the half of the sphere into thirty parts. He put six of these thirty parts of the half-sphere between the pole and the first circle; five {{between the first and}} the second; from the second to the third, four; from the third to the fourth, four again; five from the fourth to the fifth; and from the fifth to the pole, six. On these five circles he placed obliquely the circles that the Greeks call loxos or zoe, the Latins obliques or vitalis (the zodiac) because it contained the figures of the animals ascribed to the planets. On the inside of this oblique circle <b>he</b> <b>figured</b> with an extraordinary art the orbits traversed by the planets, whose paths and heights he demonstrated perfectly to his pupils, as well as their respective distances.|$|E

25|$|The Nine Chapters on the Mathematical Art, {{the title}} of which first {{appeared}} by 179 AD on a bronze inscription, was edited and commented on by the 3rd century mathematician Liu Hui from the Kingdom of Cao Wei. This book included many problems where geometry was applied, such as finding surface areas for squares and circles, the volumes of solids in various three-dimensional shapes, and included {{the use of the}} Pythagorean theorem. The book provided illustrated proof for the Pythagorean theorem, contained a written dialogue between of the earlier Duke of Zhou and Shang Gao on the properties of the right angle triangle and the Pythagorean theorem, while also referring to the astronomical gnomon, the circle and square, as well as measurements of heights and distances. The editor Liu Hui listed pi as 3.141014 by using a 192 sided polygon, and then calculated pi as 3.14159 using a 3072 sided polygon. This was more accurate than Liu Hui's contemporary Wang Fan, a mathematician and astronomer from Eastern Wu, would render pi as 3.1555 by using 142⁄45. Liu Hui also wrote of mathematical surveying to calculate distance measurements of depth, height, width, and surface area. In terms of solid geometry, <b>he</b> <b>figured</b> out that a wedge with rectangular base and both sides sloping could be broken down into a pyramid and a tetrahedral wedge. He also figured out that a wedge with trapezoid base and both sides sloping could be made to give two tetrahedral wedges separated by a pyramid. Furthermore, Liu Hui described Cavalieri's principle on volume, as well as Gaussian elimination. From the Nine Chapters, it listed the following geometrical formulas that were known {{by the time of the}} Former Han Dynasty (202 BCE9 CE).|$|E
500|$|In 2005, Timberlake felt {{inspired}} to record songs again. Motivated by the [...] "sad state" [...] of pop radio, {{he decided he}} needed to experiment with music. Reportedly, {{it was not until}} Timberlake turned to producer Timbaland [...] "that <b>he</b> <b>figured</b> out the direction he wanted the record to take". In November 2005, Timberlake visited Timbaland's brand-new Thomas Crown Studios in Virginia Beach, Virginia, United States. Timbaland had previously collaborated with Timberlake, producing four tracks for Justified including [...] "Cry Me a River".|$|E
500|$|Moffat was {{inspired}} by a crack in his son's bedroom wall and developed the idea into the main story arc for the fifth series. He thought that a child might think that something interesting lived inside such a crack. The hidden room in Amelia's house was based on Moffat's recurring childhood dream of a nonexistent hidden room in his grandmother's house. Moffat was keen to give the monster a giant eyeball, and commented that the Atraxi's design— a giant eyeball on a star— was easy for children to draw, as he used to draw Doctor Who monsters as a child. These aspects reflect Doctor Who [...] "domestically-scaled menace" [...] principle. Moffat wrote a scene that explained Prisoner Zero's crime, but cut it because <b>he</b> <b>figured</b> no one would care.|$|E

500|$|Ryukishi07 of 07th Expansion {{wrote in}} 2004 {{how he was}} {{influenced}} by Key's works during the planning of Higurashi no Naku Koro ni. Ryukishi07 played Key's games as a reference, among other visual novels, and analyzed them {{to figure out the}} reason why they were found to be so popular. <b>He</b> <b>figured</b> that the secret was due to how the stories would start with ordinary, enjoyable days, but then a sudden occurrence would happen leading the player to cry due to the shock value. He used a similar model for the basis of Higurashi but instead of leading the player to cry, Ryukishi07 wanted to scare the player with the addition of horror elements. In this way, Ryukishi07 wished to be in some way associated with Key who he described as a [...] "masterpiece maker".|$|E
500|$|In the 16th century, the Holy Roman Empire was a {{centralised}} {{state in}} name only. [...] The Empire {{was divided into}} many princely and city states that provided a powerful check on {{the rule of the}} Holy Roman Emperor. [...] The division of power between the emperor and the various states made the Reformation in Germany possible, as individual states defended reformers within their territories. In the Electorate of Saxony, Martin Luther was supported by the elector Frederick III and his successors John and John Frederick. Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse—whose lands lay midway between Saxony and the Rhine—also supported the Reformation, and <b>he</b> <b>figured</b> prominently in the lives of both Luther and Bucer. The Emperor Charles V had to balance the demands of his imperial subjects. At the same time, he was often distracted by war with France and the Ottoman Empire and in Italy. The political rivalry among all the players greatly influenced the ecclesiastical developments within the Empire.|$|E
500|$|Over {{the next}} three Australian seasons, Ring played {{regularly}} for Victoria and appeared also in some lesser representative matches. <b>He</b> <b>figured</b> in both the Donald Bradman Testimonial Match and the Alan Kippax-Bert Oldfield Testimonial, which were the big set-piece matches of the 1948–49 season, the latter {{being used as a}} [...] "Test trial" [...] for the 1949–50 tour of South Africa, for which Ring was not picked. Instead, in early 1950 he went on a non-Test playing tour of New Zealand where, in the three-day match between New Zealand and the touring side, he took seven for 88 in the home side's first innings, which remained the best figures of his first-class career. By the 1950–51 season, when Ring had one of his worst batting but better bowling seasons for Victoria, he had been overtaken in the Test match pecking order by his Victoria team-mate, Jack Iverson, whose quirky all-sorts of spin bowling was used in all five Tests.|$|E
