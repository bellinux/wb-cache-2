5|$|The Church of Scientology {{sought an}} {{injunction}} and {{a restraining order}} to prevent Anonymous from protesting on March 15, 2008, citing threats allegedly made by Anonymous. Both the injunction and the restraining order were denied. On March 31, 2008, Radar Online reported that representatives of law firms delivered legal letters to suspected Anons, often at their homes. The Church filed complaints of trespassing and criminal harassment against Boston organizer Gregg Housh, who was charged with <b>disturbing</b> an assembly of worship, <b>disturbing</b> the peace, and harassment. The District Attorney's office dropped the harassment charge, and Judge Thomas Horgan issued a continuance without finding for the remaining charges.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Tree {{condition}} {{and characteristics of}} natural regeneration of tree species was assessed in Bwindi Impenetrable National Park. Sampling was done in anthropogenically undisturbed, lightly <b>disturbed,</b> heavily <b>disturbed</b> and completely <b>disturbed</b> forest types. Nested plots measuring 25 x 30 m were established to assess tree size classes from seedlings (diameter 15 cm). Higher stem densities were found in undisturbed and lightly <b>disturbed</b> forest types compared to heavily or completely <b>disturbed</b> types. Tree species richness and diversity were highest in lightly <b>disturbed</b> forest. Acacia mearnsii, an introduced tree species in Uganda, was recorded in completely <b>disturbed</b> forest. Regeneration from vegetative sprouts was highest in <b>disturbed</b> sites while regeneration from seeds was highest in undisturbed sites. High intensity human disturbance was associated with fewer signs of mammal damage. Damage to trees by physical agents and climber abundance increased with intensity of disturbance except in completely <b>disturbed</b> forest. High intensity human disturbance adversely affected tree species abundance, diversity and regeneration and increased the incidence of damage to trees. Regeneration from vegetative sprouts was most important in heavily <b>disturbed</b> sites. Intensity of disturbance and slope influenced th...|$|R
30|$|Data <b>disturb,</b> {{known as}} {{proximity}} <b>disturb,</b> {{can occur in}} a cell in RESET state if surrounding cells are repeatedly programmed. In this case, the heat generated during the programming operation diffuses from the neighboring cells and accelerates crystallization. Another type of <b>disturb,</b> read <b>disturb,</b> occurs when a cell is read many times. This type of <b>disturb</b> is dependent upon the applied cell voltage and ambient temperature. Both these types of <b>disturb</b> are not as prevalent and so {{in the rest of}} this section we focus on the effects of data retention and cycling endurance on the error rate.|$|R

5|$|He {{then used}} a {{hypothesis}} of local realism {{to conclude that}} the other particle had these properties already determined. The principle he proposed is that if it is possible to determine what the answer to a position or momentum measurement would be, without in any way <b>disturbing</b> the particle, then the particle actually has values of position or momentum.|$|E
5|$|Improvement {{continued}} in the nineteenth century. Innovations included the first working reaping machine, developed by Patrick Bell in 1828. His rival James Smith turned to improving sub-soil drainage and developed a method of ploughing that could break up the subsoil barrier without <b>disturbing</b> the topsoil. Previously unworkable low-lying carselands could now be brought into arable production {{and the result was}} the even Lowland landscape that still predominates.|$|E
5|$|In 1935, Einstein {{returned}} {{to the question of}} quantum mechanics. He considered how a measurement on one of two entangled particles would affect the other. He noted, along with his collaborators, that by performing different measurements on the distant particle, either of position or momentum, different properties of the entangled partner could be discovered without <b>disturbing</b> it in any way.|$|E
40|$|The {{impacts of}} {{disturbance}} were explored for red deer (Cervus elaphus) in the Scottish Highlands, {{by studying the}} distribution, behaviour and diet composition of deer in areas that were <b>disturbed</b> or less <b>disturbed</b> by human recreation, in different habitat types (grassland, heather moorland and woodland) and {{at different times of}} year.   The human-caused predation risk hypothesis states that there are similarities between the responses elicited by wild animals towards human recreational disturbance and predation.   This hypothesis was tested by comparing behaviour during the recreation season (spring and summer) and the hunting season (autumn and winter). Deer densities were lower in <b>disturbed</b> areas than less <b>disturbed</b> areas throughout the year, although {{there was no difference in}} relative habitat use as a result of disturbance. Habitat selection was primarily influenced by season, with grasslands having higher deer densities during the spring and summer and heather moorlands having higher densities during the winter. Behaviour was monitored using scan sampling of groups.   The percentage of animals that were vigilant was higher, resulting in a smaller number of deer feeding in <b>disturbed</b> than less <b>disturbed</b> areas during the recreational season.   Vigilance was higher in <b>disturbed</b> grassland and heather moorland than undisturbed woodland, while behaviour was similar in <b>disturbed</b> woodland and the less <b>disturbed</b> habitats.   In <b>disturbed</b> heather and woodland and in all less <b>disturbed</b> habitats, the majority of animals were standing while vigilant, whilst in <b>disturbed</b> grassland, lying was the main mode of vigilance.   Deer were more likely to be close together when vigilance levels were high.

40|$|Five villages {{undertaking}} joint {{forest management}} (JFM) were chosen in Uttara Kannada district, Karnataka for assessing regeneration in plantations and nearby natural {{forests of the}} village. Species number, stem density, diversity index, similarity in species composition in less <b>disturbed</b> and <b>disturbed</b> forests and plantations in the village were compared. Stem density was low in all the <b>disturbed</b> forests; however, the species number was low in <b>disturbed</b> forests of three villages and high in two villages. Plantations showed lower diversity values compared to the adjacent natural forests. Regeneration in all less <b>disturbed</b> forests was better compared to the <b>disturbed</b> counterparts. Villages were ranked based on number of landless families, per, capita forest available and number of cut stems. Assessment of village forests using ranks indicates that parameters such as per capita availability, cut stems in the forests may determine the success of JFM...|$|R

5|$|After World War I, {{the rivalry}} calmed, and Gothenburg {{supporters}} {{became known as}} friendly and sportsmanlike fans. However, this only applied to the behaviour on home ground, as IFK supporters continued to behave badly when travelling to away matches by train (called Göteborgstågen, the Gothenburg trains), a phenomenon that grew quickly in the 1920s. This behaviour peaked in 1939, just after the outbreak of World War II, when approximately 1,900 IFK fans travelled to Borås to see IFK play Elfsborg. After a 2–3 loss, the fans fought with the Borås police, before returning home to Gothenburg and <b>disturbing</b> a wartime blackout exercise.|$|E
40|$|The wind {{profiles}} in the wakes of buildings in a <b>disturbed</b> shear layer are investigated for conditions experienced during aircraft take-off and landing.

Velocity and turbulence profiles of <b>disturbed</b> and equilibrium flows upstream and downstream of the obstacles are presented. It is concluded that the integrated momentum flow of a boundary layer behind an obstacle can be greater than the upstream momentum flow, if the exponent of the upstream velocity profile is sufficiently high and the boundary layer has been <b>disturbed</b> by upstream obstacles. The rise of the turbulence level behind the obstacle is also dependent on the profile exponent in a <b>disturbed</b> layer...|$|R

5|$|Closed-circuit or semi-closed circuit rebreather scuba systems allow {{recycling}} of exhaled gases. The volume of gas used is reduced {{compared to that}} of open circuit, so a smaller cylinder or cylinders may be used for an equivalent dive duration. They far extend the time spent underwater as compared to open circuit for the same gas consumption. Rebreathers produce fewer bubbles and less noise than scuba which makes them attractive to covert military divers to avoid detection, scientific divers to avoid <b>disturbing</b> marine animals, and media divers to avoid bubble interference.|$|E

40|$|Background & Aims Sleep {{disturbances}} {{are common}} in patients with cirrhosis, but their determinants and effects on health-related quality of life are not well-understood. We investigated the prevalence of <b>disturbed</b> sleep in these patients, factors associated with sleep disruption, and effects on quality of life. Methods We performed a prospective, cross-sectional study of 193 stable ambulatory patients with cirrhosis (154 with decompensated cirrhosis). Participants completed the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (to assess sleep quality), the Chronic Liver Disease Questionnaire (CLDQ), and muscle cramp questionnaires and underwent neurocognitive testing. Actigraphy was performed in a subset of patients with normal and <b>disturbed</b> sleep. We collected serum samples from subjects with normal and <b>disturbed</b> sleep and performed non-targeted metabolomic analyses. Results Of the study subjects, 157 (81 %) had <b>disturbed</b> sleep, with Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index scores > 5. <b>Disturbed</b> sleep was associated with muscle cramps, daytime somnolence, and decreased quality {{of life on the}} basis of CLDQ scores. Factors independently associated with <b>disturbed</b> sleep in logistic regression analysis included hypoalbuminemia, opiate therapy, and muscle cramps. <b>Disturbed</b> sleep was independently associated with CLDQ score (correlation parameter, – 36. 6; 95 % confidence interval, – 24 to – 49; P <. 001) on linear regression. <b>Disturbed</b> sleep was associated with neurocognitive impairment and with significantly delayed bedtime and decreased total sleep time, measured by actigraphy. <b>Disturbed</b> sleep was associated with metabolome signatures of alterations to the intestinal microbiome and lipid, arginine, and urea cycle metabolism. Conclusions Most patients with advanced cirrhosis (81 %) have <b>disturbed</b> sleep. This has negative effects on quality of life and is associated with disruptions of several metabolic pathways, including metabolism by the intestinal microbiota...|$|R
