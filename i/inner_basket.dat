50|$|B&P Process Equipment and Systems (B&P) {{makes the}} largest {{single-stage}} pusher centrifuge, which they {{claimed to be}} superior to multistage designs. They claimed that additional impurities enter the liquid housing due to additional particles tumbling in each stage. The problem can be overcome by using a shorter <b>inner</b> <b>basket</b> with smaller diameter between the pusher plates and the basket and enabling pusher movement to take place between the pusher plate and the basket {{as well as between}} the <b>inner</b> <b>basket</b> and the outer basket. Compared to single-stage pushers that have pusher movement only between pusher plate and basket, multistage centrifuges have the advantages that the cake height is reduced, filtration resistance is lower and lesser force is required.|$|E
50|$|Nearly all front-loader washers for the {{consumer}} market must also use a folded flexible bellows assembly around the door opening, to keep clothing contained inside the basket during the tumbling wash cycle. If this bellows assembly were not used, small articles of clothing such as socks could slip out of the wash basket near the door, and fall down the narrow slot between the outer tub and basket, plugging the drain and possibly jamming rotation of the <b>inner</b> <b>basket.</b> Retrieving lost items from between the outer tub and <b>inner</b> <b>basket</b> can require complete disassembly of {{the front of the}} washer and pulling out the entire inner wash basket. Commercial and industrial front-loaders used by businesses (described below) usually do not use the bellows, and instead require all small objects to be placed in a mesh bag to prevent loss near the basket opening.|$|E
5000|$|Maintenance and reliability: Top-loading washers {{are more}} {{tolerant}} of maintenance neglect, and may not need a regular [...] "freshening" [...] cycle to clean door seals and bellows. During the spin cycle, a top-loading tub is free to move about inside the cabinet of the machine, using only a lip {{around the top of}} the <b>inner</b> <b>basket</b> and outer tub to keep the spinning water and clothing from spraying out over the edge. Therefore, the potentially problematic door-sealing and door-locking mechanisms used by true front-loaders are not needed. On the other hand, top-loaders use mechanical gearboxes that are more vulnerable to wear than simpler front-load motor drives.|$|E
50|$|The peeler {{centrifuge}} is {{a device}} that performs by rotating filtration basket in an axis. A centrifuge follows {{on the principle of}} centrifugal force to separate solids from liquids by density difference. High rotation speed provides high centrifugal force that allows the suspended solid in feed to settle on the <b>inner</b> surface of <b>basket.</b> There are three kinds of centrifuge, horizontal, vertical peeler centrifuge and siphon peeler centrifuge. These classes of instrument apply to various areas such as fertilisers, pharmaceutical, plastics and food including artificial sweetener and modified starch.|$|R
40|$|A cathode-anode {{arrangement}} {{for use in}} an electrolytic cell is adapted for electrochemically refining spent nuclear fuel from a nuclear reactor and recovering purified uranium and a mixture of uranium and plutonium {{for use as a}} fresh blanket and core fuel in a nuclear reactor. The arrangement includes a plurality of <b>inner</b> anodic dissolution <b>baskets</b> that are each attached to a respective support rod, are submerged in a molten lithium halide salt, and are rotationally displaced. An inner hollow cylindrical-shaped cathode is concentrically disposed about the <b>inner</b> anodic dissolution <b>baskets.</b> Concentrically disposed about the inner cathode in a spaced manner are a plurality of outer anodic dissolution baskets, while an outer hollow cylindrical-shaped cathode is disposed about the outer anodic dissolution baskets. Uranium is deposited from the anode baskets in a uniform cylindrical shape on the inner and outer cathode cylinders by rotating the anode baskets within the molten lithium halide salt. Scrapers located on each anode basket abrade and remove the spent fuel deposits on the surfaces of the inner and outer cathode cylinders, with the spent fuel falling {{to the bottom of the}} cell for removal. Cell resistance is reduced and uranium collection efficiency enhanced by increasing the electrode area and reducing the anode-cathode spacing for enhanced trapping and recovery of uranium dendrites scraped off of the cylindrical cathodes which may be greater in number than two...|$|R
50|$|This layout mounts the <b>inner</b> <b>basket</b> {{and outer}} tub horizontally, and loading {{is through a}} door {{at the front of}} the machine. The door often but not always {{contains}} a transparent window. Agitation is supplied by the back-and-forth rotation of the cylinder and by gravity. The clothes are lifted up by paddles on the inside wall of the drum and then dropped. This motion flexes the weave of the fabric and forces water and detergent solution through the clothes load. Because the wash action does not require the clothing be freely suspended in water, only enough water is needed to moisten the fabric. Because less water is required, front-loaders typically use less soap, and the repeated dropping and folding action of the tumbling can easily produce large amounts of foam or suds.|$|E
40|$|The immanent {{commercial}} obsolescence of the VCR affords film studies a new {{opportunity to}} examine domestic spectatorship and the challenges it poses to contemporaneous apparatus theory. While scholars like Christian Metz and Jean-Louis Baudry have argued that spectators understand movie projection as a gendered process of motion picture reproduction, the VCR’s electronic engineering – its <b>inner</b> <b>basket,</b> heads, and stacks – demonstrate that filmic sexuality does not necessarily conform to heterosexist binaries. The VCR’s sexualized inner architecture incarnates neither the alleged masculine gaze of cinema nor its televisual counterpart, the feminine glance, but rather suggests that the domestic viewer approaches film with a hermaphroditic curiosity that emphasizes the physical pleasure of making movies...|$|E
40|$|Vertebrate Tpr and its yeast homologs Mlp 1 /Mlp 2, long coiled-coil {{proteins}} {{of nuclear}} pore <b>inner</b> <b>basket</b> filaments, {{are involved in}} mRNA export, telomere organization, spindle pole assembly, and unspliced RNA retention. We identified Arabidopsis thaliana NUCLEAR PORE ANCHOR (NUA) encoding a 237 -kD protein with similarity to Tpr. NUA {{is located at the}} inner surface of the nuclear envelope in interphase and {{in the vicinity of the}} spindle in prometaphase. Four T-DNA insertion lines were characterized, which comprise an allelic series of increasing severity for several correlating phenotypes, such as early flowering under short days and long days, increased abundance of SUMO conjugates, altered expression of several flowering regulators, and nuclear accumulation of poly(A) + RNA. nua mutants phenocopy mutants of EARLY IN SHORT DAYS 4 (ESD 4), an Arabidopsis SUMO protease concentrated at the nuclear periphery. nua esd 4 double mutants resemble nua and esd 4 single mutants, suggesting that the two proteins act in the same pathway or complex, supported by yeast two-hybrid interaction. Our data indicate that NUA is a component of nuclear pore-associated steps of sumoylation and mRNA export in plants and that defects in these processes affect the signaling events of flowering time regulation and additional developmental processes...|$|E
