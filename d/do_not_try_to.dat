5|$|Out of {{a belief}} that many women in the sex {{industry}} have been spiritually abused by Christians trying to frighten {{them out of the}} sex industry with warnings of damnation, JC's Girls focuses on telling these women that God loves them. JC's Girls volunteers tell the women about the gospel but <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> persuade them to leave the sex industry; the organization recognizes that is often not financially viable for women in the sex industry to immediately sacrifice their employment. JC's Girls connects female sex workers with churches the organization believes to be non-judgmental, hoping that the women will experience the love of Christ through these churches and that they will thereby eventually have the support and strength they need to leave the industry. Prior to referring a woman to a church, JC's Girls puts the church through a formal approval process to ensure that the church will not be judgmental. If women express a desire to leave the sex industry, JC's Girls attempts to support them in doing so.|$|E

25|$|Males of V. maculifrons tend to form loose aggregations, {{resembling}} leks, during mating. In one area, hundreds {{to thousands}} of males patrol prominent trees and bushes by constantly flying around them. Males typically patrol large areas randomly, rather than limiting to a few trees. If a male sees a female while patrolling, he flies closer to the female in a zigzag fashion and stops on a nearby leaf. This then allows the male to climb onto the female’s gaster from behind. Other males <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> approach an ongoing copulation, but a male might try to copulate immediately after. If a second mating occurs, sperm competition may favor the second male. As a result, males can prevent competition from another male by elongating copulation.|$|E
500|$|Lisa {{plays the}} {{baritone}} saxophone, and some episodes {{use that as}} a plot device. According to Matt Groening, the baritone saxophone was chosen because he found the thought of an eight-year-old girl playing it amusing. He added, [...] "But she doesn't always play a baritone sax because the animators don't know what it looks like, so it changes shape and color from show to show." [...] One of the hallmarks of the show's opening sequence is a brief solo Lisa plays on her saxophone after being thrown out of music class. The Simpsons composer Alf Clausen said that the session musicians who perform her solos <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> play at the second grade level and instead [...] "think of Lisa as a really good player." ...|$|E

Contemporary Chinese painters, however, feel that only paintings with mountain and water images that follow specific conventions of form, style and function should be called [...] "shan shui painting." [...] When Chinese painters work on shan shui painting, they <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> present an image {{of what they have}} seen in the nature, but what they have thought about nature.

[...] In the Star Trek: Voyager episode [...] "", [...] Seven of Nine told Neelix that the Kazon were [...] "unworthy" [...] of assimilation and would only detract from the Borg's quest for perceived perfection.|$|E
