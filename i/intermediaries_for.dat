25|$|In certain cases, as in India, {{the colonial}} power {{directed}} all decisions related {{to foreign policy}} and defense, while the indigenous population controlled most aspects of internal administration. This led to autonomous indigenous communities that were {{under the rule of}} local tribal chiefs or kings. These chiefs were either drawn from the existing social hierarchy or were newly minted by the colonial authority. In areas under indirect rule, traditional authorities acted as <b>intermediaries</b> <b>for</b> the “despotic” colonial rule, while the colonial government acted as an advisor and only interfered in extreme circumstances. Often, {{with the support of the}} colonial authority, natives gained more power under indirect colonial rule than they had in the pre-colonial period. Mamdani points out that indirect rule was the dominant form of colonialism and therefore most who were colonized bore colonial rule that was delivered by their fellow natives.|$|E

Jevđević and pre-war Chetnik leader Ilija Trifunović-Birčanin sought to work with the Italians in the belief that an Italian occupation of both Bosnia and Herzegovina would limit the ability of the NDH to carry out its anti-Serb policies. Jevđević reportedly hoped that the Italians would allow the formation of a Serbian state of Bosnia and Herzegovina under their protection, but they were more interested in obtaining the practical assistance of his Chetniks in fighting the Partisans than helping him achieve his political aims.
