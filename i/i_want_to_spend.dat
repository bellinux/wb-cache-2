500|$|In June 2002, {{cast members}} from Holby City and Casualty competed against the EastEnders cast {{for the first}} Sport Relief fundraiser, in a segment dubbed [...] "Sport in the Square". The teams competed in events such as taxi pulling, melon tossing and a beer keg relay. The {{competition}} was televised on BBC One, and the event as a whole raised £10million. In October 2003, BBC One aired a [...] "Kenyon Confronts" [...] documentary by Panorama reporter Paul Kenyon, investigating hospitals run by the Private Finance Initiative. He discovered many problems within the hospitals, which were dramatised by the Holby City cast in specially commissioned scenes. March 2004 saw the station air the documentary [...] "Making It at Holby", {{as part of a}} BBC initiative to develop new acting talent. The documentary followed the casting process of Holby City and Casualty, from the audition stages to the filming of the selected actors' first scenes. Young explained his casting criteria, revealing: [...] "I try to put my head into the head of a viewer and ask: do <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> three years in the life of this person?" [...] 17 November 2006 Children in Need charity telethon included a segment featuring the Holby City cast performing a comical version of [...] "Hung Up" [...] by Madonna. 16 November 2007 Children in Need appeal again contained a musical performance from Holby City cast members. Sharon D Clarke, backed by Nadine Lewington, Rakie Ayola and Phoebe Thomas performed a soul version of Aretha Franklin's signature song, [...] "Respect". On 28 June 2008, Holby City stars competed against their Casualty counterparts in a special charity edition of BBC Two game-show The Weakest Link. Holby City and Casualty cast members united on 20 February 2010, performing a dance rendition of [...] "Jai Ho" [...] for Let's Dance for Sport Relief.|$|E

2500|$|In 1997, his {{autobiography}} and art book, <b>I</b> <b>Want</b> <b>To</b> <b>Spend</b> the Rest of My Life Everywhere, with Everyone, One to One, Always, Forever, Now, was published. With Alex James {{of the band}} Blur and actor Keith Allen, he formed the band Fat Les, achieving a number 2 hit with a raucous football-themed song Vindaloo, followed up by Jerusalem with the London Gay Men's Chorus. Hirst also painted a simple colour pattern for the Beagle 2 probe. This pattern was {{to be used to}} calibrate the probe's cameras after it had landed on Mars. He turned down the British Council's invitation to be the UK's representative at the 1999 Venice Biennale because [...] "it didn't feel right". He threatened to sue British Airways claiming a breach of copyright over an advert design with coloured spots for its low budget airline, Go.|$|E
2500|$|Hirst's {{first major}} {{international}} presentation {{was in the}} Venice Biennale in 1993 with the work, Mother and Child Divided, a cow and a calf cut into sections and exhibited {{in a series of}} separate vitrines. He curated the show Some Went Mad, Some Ran Away in 1994 at the Serpentine Gallery in London, where he exhibited Away from the Flock (a sheep in a tank of formaldehyde). On 9 May, Mark Bridger, a 35-year-old artist from Oxford, walked into the gallery and poured black ink into the tank, and retitled the work Black Sheep. [...] He was subsequently prosecuted, at Hirst's wish, and was given two years' probation. The sculpture was restored at a cost of £1,000. When a photograph of Away from the Flock was reproduced in the 1997 book by Hirst <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> {{the rest of my life}} everywhere, with everyone, one-to-one, always, forever, now, the vandalism was referenced by allowing the tank to be obscured by pulling a card, reproducing the effect of ink being poured into the tank; this resulted in Hirst being sued by Bridger for violating his copyright on Black Sheep.|$|E

Taylforth commented, [...] "I love EastEnders, it's in my blood. But after 12 years I want {{a bit of a}} change. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>spend</b> more time with my family and consider other offers. It was an extremely difficult decision to make but I felt this was the best time to go. I've had alternative job offers in the past, but I've always stuck with EastEnders. It's been brilliant for me and I will miss it hugely." [...] At the time, a BBC spokesperson would not confirm the departure saying, [...] "Gilly is in discussions about taking a possible break. It is the policy that long-serving, valued, senior cast members are eligible for such breaks." [...] However, her departure was later confirmed, with Taylforth saying that she made the decision to quit after she missed her daughter's sports day due to filming commitments on set. Barbara Windsor, who plays Kathy's mother-in-law Peggy Mitchell, said: [...] "This is really sad. Gill is a wonderful actress and a very good friend."

She wore a fur sack, and she was equipped against the cold as exquisitely as her Southern sisters defend themselves from the summer. Bits of warm color, in ribbon and scarf, flashed out here and there; when she flung open her sack, she showed herself much more lavishly buttoned and bugled and bangled than the Americans. She sat clown on the movable bench which Bartley had vacated, and crossed her feet, very small and saucy, even in their arctics, on a stick of fire-wood, and cast up her neat profile, and rapidly made eyes at every part of the interior.
