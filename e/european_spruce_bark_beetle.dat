All trap models proved to be efficient and gave high captures of beetles during operation for one summer season (2013). Ranking the trap models in descending order of total capture of beetles gave this list: Lindgren trap, Theysohn, prototype-P, Ecotrap, BEKA, and prototype-K. However, there was much variation in trapping results between localities for all trap models, and the estimated means did in most cases not differ significantly between models. The estimated mean capture of the Lindgren trap was significantly higher than for prototype-K and BEKA, but their confidence intervals were wide and they were close to being insignificantly different. The retail price of the traps vary from about 10 € (Ecotrap) to 50 - 55 € (Lindgren), while prices are not available for the two prototypes, which are not in regular production.

40|$|The {{effect of}} climate change on the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> Model {{simulations}} show that an increased frequency in storms and drought periods may result in more frequent and shorter outbreaks of <b>bark</b> <b>beetles.</b> Warmer summers can result in two <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> generations per summer instead of one, giving <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> the opportunity to attack forests twice in a single year. By Bjørn Økland, Paal Krokene and Holger Lange In a NORKLIMA project financed by the Research Council of Norway, we have focused on how climate change can affect an important species for Norwegian forestry, namely the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus). The <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> {{is one of the}} few insects in Norway capable of killing trees in large numbers, and this makes it an important species in both economic and ecological terms. Recurring outbreaks over the last few centuries have had catastrophic effects on forests in Central and Northern Europe. The most recent outbreak in southern Norway in the 1970 s killed forests equivalent to five million cubic meters of lumber, which at the time was worth about 500 million kroner (about 84 million dollars). The <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> is also important in ecological terms. When the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> kills entire swathes of trees, i...|$|R
50|$|The <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> has a {{significant}} impact on both the ecological and economic environment of Norway spruce forests. Together with storm events, bark beetle outbreaks are thought by some {{to be one of the}} most important natural disturbances in this region. Some scientists consider this beetle to be a keystone species, in part because it has an unusually high number of relationships with other organisms in the community and because it changes its environment so drastically. Others disagree, because it is also an invasive species in the area.|$|E
5000|$|Polish {{environmentalists say}} that logging is {{threatening}} the {{flora and fauna}} in the forest, including species of rare birds, such as the white-backed woodpecker, who lost 30% of their population in forestry-managed areas in the 1990s and 2000s. Poland's state forestry board claims the logging is for protection and for ecological reasons, [...] protecting against the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle.</b> From 2012, the amount of wood that can be extracted by foresters annually was reduced from about [...] to just [...] and most of it is sold locally, mainly as firewood.|$|E
50|$|The {{productive}} {{forest in}} Norway {{is expected to}} increase considerably due to climate change, but not without complications. Mild winters will reduce the resistance of trees and their frost tolerance. Freeze-thaw cycles will also be more frequent during mild winters, damaging the trees. Pest invasions and diseases are expected to be more frequent as new pests can move rapidly northwards. It is also possible that insects will be able to reproduce one more generation per summer due to higher temperatures, so that for instance the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> may damage spruce trees with an extra invasion per summer.|$|E

This experiment is shown on particular problem of <b>Spruce</b> <b>Bark</b> <b>Beetle</b> in the National Park of Šumava. There are two main streams towards this issue of <b>Spruce</b> <b>Bark</b> Beetle-one of them promotes the idea of incorporating the human intervention, while reducing the disaster, the other follows the opposite attitude towards {{the outbreak of the}} <b>Spruce</b> <b>Bark</b> <b>Beetle,</b> and that is not to intervene at all and to leave the destructed vegetation to regenerate. The backbone of the thesis is represented by a survey that aims at finding attitudes towards the problem mentioned above. Moreover, the survey also questions the way the attitudes change depending on critical reading of distinctive texts. Two main questions are posed in this research. The results are graphically depicted and commented upon in the thesis. The research shows {{the extent to which it}} is possible to influence the students' opinion utilising quality study texts.

40|$|<b>Spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus (Linnaeus, 1758)) is {{our most}} serious pests, {{frequently}} invading spruce stands. The most important predators of I. typographus are two species from genus Thanasimus - Thanasimus formicarius (Linnaeus, 1758) and Thanasimus femoralis (Zetterstedt, 1828). Monitoring {{of these three}} species were carried out from April to August, using pheromone traps type Theyson with pheromone lures designed for their capture. New pheromone lure attracting beetles of genus Thanasimus has been tested. It was used a total of six traps that were placed at three locations. Two traps were always placed at one location, one with pheromone lure Pheroprax attracting <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> and the second one with pheromone lure called Thanasiwit attracting beetles of the genus Thanasimus. All traps were checked once a week. A total of 10 291 of <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> were captured, 25 specimens of T. formicarius and 7 individuals of T. femoralis. <b>Spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> flight activity had two generations and one sister brood. The first catches were recorded on 26 April 2015 {{and the end of}} the flight activity was recorded on 26 July 2015. The species T. formicarius flight activity was from 12 April 2015 to 2 August 2015 and during this period two generations were recorded. For T. femoralis flight activity was from 17 April 2015 until 9 August 2015, during this period we also recorded two generations, which took place before and after the flight activity of I. typographus. Laboratory work was conducted after the end of captures. From every of sample twenty individuals were dissected and then inspected using a light microscope to presence of pathogens. The most frequently identified pathogen of <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetles</b> were nematodes, but only in one case nematods were identified in T. formicarius.

This relationship was analysed under outbreak conditions. The number of traps varied in different years from 70 to 92. The traps were installed in spruce-forest-dominated stands affected by a windstorm in 2004. A GPS device was used to mark the position of the pheromone traps. The potential solar radiation was calculated with GIS tools for three different time periods in each year: with entire year, for main flight season of the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> and the spring swarming period.

50|$|Nematodes of Micoletzkya live in {{symbiosis}} with bark beetles. The hosts include economically important species across North America and Europe such as {{the mountain}} pine beetle Dendroctonus ponderosae and <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> Ips typographus. The life history of the nematodes is closely linked to that of their hosts. Infective (dauer) larvae of Micoletzkya attach themselves onto the body surface of a beetle for transmission and resume their development in host breeding galleries. In the bark beetle galleries, nematodes go through a few free-living generations, presumably feeding on beetle-associated microorganisms and other nematodes, after which dauer larvae develop and attach to newly emerging bark beetles for transmission.|$|E
50|$|The adults overwinter at {{the base}} of conifers, rarely of {{deciduous}} trees. They emerge in the spring and fly to lower parts of trees to hunt bark beetles. Their common prey are pine bark beetles Tomicus piniperda and T. minor, and the <b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> Ips typographus. Often they are seen waiting their prey on the bark of fallen pine or spruce trees. Both ant beetles and bark beetles are attracted to monoterpenes from the damaged areas of the fallen trees. Stacked wood is especially attractive due to the monoterpene volatiles. The ant beetles are also attracted to specific pheromone components of bark beetles therefore they often fall into bark beetle pheromone traps. The larvae enter the scolytid galleries and feed on the immature stages of the bark beetles. The larvae grow very slowly, spending two years in the larval stage, and pupate in the fall in niches in the outer bark. Adults of T. formicarius live 4 to 10 months.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{evaluates the}} {{effectiveness}} of defensive techniques against the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus L.) with a primary focus on pheromone traps and selected factors affecting their efficacy. The factors tested are the setup system of pheromone traps and type of pheromone dispenser baits, {{the effect on the}} efficacy of pheromone traps of increasing evaporated pheromones, a comparison of the biological efficacy of different types of pheromone dispensers and an assessment of their impact on the swarming curve. In addition, an evaluation of non-traditional methods of forest protection against the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (water spraying of whole landings, efficacy of insecticidal sraying of whole landings, and the use of insecticidal nets) was conducted and the possibility of the <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> s sex determination was also examined. When comparing the systems of pheromone traps installation, (1) the standard way was along the stand edge with 20 m space and (2) traps concentrating in the centre of clear cut adjacent to each other with different baiting, the most effective way was found to be the standard trap arrangement and the system with traps installed in line with the dispenser in each pheromone trap. Efficacy decreased with a lower number of pheromone dispensers. The influence of increased amounts of evaporated pheromone on efficacy was tested. Pheromone traps with one, two or three dispensers were compared and it was found that a trap s efficacy was not increased with a higher amount of released pheromone. The Pheagr IT and IT Ecolure Tubus dispensers showed unchanged effectivity throughout the flight activity of <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle,</b> but other dispensers need to be replaced according to the instructions since their efficacy decreases, thus affecting the swarming curve.

40|$|Bark beetle {{outbreaks}} have {{a devastating}} effect on economically important forests worldwide, thus requiring extensive application of management control strategies. The presence of unmanaged protected areas {{in close proximity}} to managed forests can instigate concerns that bark beetle infestations may spread from unmanaged into managed stands.

Bayesian inferences of migration rates and a most parsimonious dispersal tree show that outgoing gene flow was consistently higher from managed to unmanaged areas. Reason for that is likely the thorough removal of potential breeding material in managed forests and thus the dispersal of the base stock beetles from these areas to unmanaged areas where breeding material is available. Our study suggests that the potential threat posed by unmanaged to managed forests in regard to I. typographus infestation needs to be carefully re-considered...|$|E

Using a cross-correlation function between the time series, an increase in the abundance of I. typographus due to windfall was demonstrated with a delay of 1 – 3 years. Wind damage was also shown to arise as a result of disturbed stand stability after sanitation felling with a stochastic delay of 1 − 5 years.

40|$|<b>European</b> <b>spruce</b> <b>bark</b> <b>beetle</b> (Ips typographus) is {{a natural}} forest pest that feeds on {{coniferous}} trees, mainly on spruce. Previous studies showed that population growth of bark beetle is supported by warm and dry weather and hindered by cold and humid weather. Temperature affects development rates and influences the number of generations bark beetle may produce during one season; furthermore, it affects survival rates during the winter. Low precipitation leads to water stress of spruce trees which become more prone to bark beetle infestation. High precipitation promotes growth of mold and other natural enemies of bark beetle. The aim of the experimental part of this thesis was to analyze the relationship between population dynamics of bark beetle and weather, {{using data from the}} Šumava national park. Data did not show a significant effect of temperature and precipitation on the population growth rate of bark beetle.

Both species have also experienced large outbreaks in recent years. But {{the magnitude of}} the outbreaks of D. ponderosae is much larger. In this review we compare the outbreak history of I. typographus in Sweden with D. ponderosae in British Columbia in Canada. We also discuss some possible explanations for the difference in outbreak magnitude between the two species. During the last fifty years (1960 - 2009), three outbreaks of I. typographus have occurred in Sweden which resulted in a volume of about 9 million m 3 of killed Norway spruces (Picea abies). During the same period D. ponderosae has killed about 600 million m 3 of lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta) in British Columbia. Based on a literature review we suggest two factors that may contribute to the much more severe outbreaks caused by D. ponderosae: (1) a lower colonisation density needed by D. ponderosae to overcome tree defences and (2) a higher reproductive success of D. ponderosae in killed trees. In addition, the proportion of old stands, susceptible to bark beetle attacks, is much higher in British Columbia than in Sweden...|$|E
