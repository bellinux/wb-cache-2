50|$|In 1256, Damscheid had {{its first}} {{documentary}} mention and got its first church sometime between 1150 and 1200. Indeed, Damscheid’s oldest {{and at the}} same time most striking building work is the square churchtower with its pointed <b>helm</b> <b>roof.</b> It bears witness to Damscheid’s having had a role in the Hunsrück’s power structures long before the first documentary mention. It was once a defensive tower, and according to expert opinion, was built between 1130 and 1150. Arrowslits, some of which can still be made out, show that the tower had a defensive function in the Middle Ages.|$|E
50|$|The Gothic Revival {{structure}} was constructed of random fieldstone ashlars, capped with sandstone; {{the roof was}} slate over an open timber arched frame. A separate chancel {{was placed on the}} south end of the building, and a shed-roofed ambulatory was run along the west side to house a side chapel and its altar. An odd detail was a set of dormers in the main west side roof, each with a lancet window; other windows also generally were of the lancet form, including a triple set at either end of the building. A belltower was attached to the northwest corner of the building; its third story, which contained the bell chamber, was topped with a Rhenish <b>helm</b> <b>roof</b> and was made octagonal through the truncation of the four corners.|$|E
