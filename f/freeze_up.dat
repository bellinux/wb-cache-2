25|$|In 1910, the Nechacco {{had been}} re-registered as the Chilco and was piloted {{for the first}} part of the season by Captain Bonser and the latter part by Captain George Ritchie. Late in November, she was on her way back from Soda Creek with South Fort George's winter food {{supplies}} and had just passed the Cottonwood Canyon when she hit a reef and sank. The river was nearing <b>freeze</b> <b>up</b> and nothing could be done at that time to salvage her, so the cargo was removed and taken down to Quesnel. Upon hearing of the wreck, one of the Chilco's owners, Russell Peden, and South Fort George hotelier, Al Johnson, immediately snow-shoed down to Quesnel to petition Captain Browne, who was then master of the BX, to make one last trip upriver with the much needed supplies. Browne consented and the supplies were delivered without incident, although ice had already begun to form along the shoreline.|$|E

500|$|Unfortunately, Ben's past {{comes up}} again during Leslie's {{interview}} with newspaper reporter Shauna Malwae-Tweep (Alison Becker), who asks why Pawnee should accept financial guidance from {{someone with a}} poor budget managing record like Ben. Tom and Ben go on the television show [...] "Ya' Heard? with Perd" [...] with Perd Hapley (Jay Jackson) {{in the hopes of}} recovering from the earlier debacle, but this interview is even worse, with Ben launching into a furious, incoherent rant when his past is brought up. [...] As a result, several businesses consider pulling their sponsorships from the Harvest Festival. Leslie decides to use her upcoming interview on [...] "Pawnee Today" [...] with Joan Callamezzo (Mo Collins) to perform damage control. During the interview, Joan asks very biased questions about the festival and Ben's past. Annoyed, Leslie brings Ben on stage to give him a final opportunity to explain himself. Ben again begins to <b>freeze</b> <b>up</b> at the questions from people calling in, but he finally gets over it and vigorously defends himself. By the end, the questions switch back from Ben to the festival itself, making the media blitz a successful one after all.|$|E

2500|$|Journalist Irwin Ross {{summed up}} the contradictions in Dewey's {{personality}} by noting that [...] "more than most politicians, he displayed an enormous gap between his private and his public manner. To friends and colleagues he was warm and gracious, considerate of others' views… He could tell a joke and was not dismayed by an off-color story. In public, however, he tended to <b>freeze</b> <b>up,</b> either out of diffidence or too stern {{a sense of the}} dignity of office. The smiles would seem forced… the glad-handing gesture awkward." [...] In a similar vein, a magazine writer in the 1940s described the difference between Dewey's private and public behavior by noting that [...] "Till he gets to the door, he may be cracking jokes and laughing like a schoolboy. But the moment he enters a room he ceases to be Tom Dewey and becomes what he thinks the Governor of New York ought to be." ...|$|E

[...] The troubles had become a public relations issue for Diem beyond his country, with speculation about a US-Diệm rift being discussed in American newspapers following the self-immolation. The New York Times ran a front page headline on 14 June, citing leaked government information that diplomats had privately attacked Diem's handling of the crisis. It also reported that General Paul Harkins, {{the head of the}} US advisory mission in South Vietnam to order his men not to assist ARVN units that were taking action against demonstrators. The US at the time considered telling Vice President Tho that they would support him replacing Diem as President. This occurred at the time as the surfacing of rumours that South Vietnamese air force Chief of Staff Lieutenant Colonel Đỗ Khắc Mai had begun gauging support among his colleagues for a coup.|$|E

[...] Before {{passenger}} accommodations were installed, Rossland was worked towing barges while the Lytton was being overhauled. [...] Passenger service for Rossland began in early 1898. [...] At her maximum speed, 22 miles per hour, Rossland was easily the fast vessel on the lakes. [...] However, she burned too much coal at this pace, and normally did not run so fast. [...] Steamboats were prone to damage and even destruction by fire, as Nakusp had been in 1897. [...] In 1899 Rossland caught fire [...] below the down of Nakusp. [...] Fortunately Captain Forslund was able to beach the vessel and extinguish the flames. [...] Steamboat operation on the Arrow Lakes was seasonal, as they were generally frozen over during winter.

2500|$|IGN's Chris Roper was {{impressed}} with New York City, praising [...] "how well your general duties as a cop are tied into the game, working very well alongside your own personal investigations," [...] and finding the gameplay and game mechanics superior to Streets of LA. Eurogamer's Jim Rossignol was critical of the AI; [...] "the perps you take down never suggest that they are anything other than mindless automata ready to be slain, and exhibit an artificiality that could never be described as 'intelligence'." [...] GameSpy's Sterling McGarvey wrote [...] "Luxoflux have turned a slightly above-par GTA clone into a sub-par franchise." [...] Of the graphics, he wrote, [...] "the frame rate {{has a knack for}} chugging. Considering it's a console and not a five year-old PC running this game, it's unacceptable. Out of nowhere, the frame rate will completely bottom out while Marcus patrols the streets." [...] He called the game [...] "unfinished." [...] GameSpot's Greg Mueller accused the game of being [...] "so riddled with problems that it feels like it was rushed to make it to store shelves in time for the holidays. He cited [...] "collision detection issues and edge detection problems that cause you to get stuck {{on the edge of a}} platform. [...] the game will actually <b>freeze</b> <b>up</b> entirely from time to time [...] There are also some pretty ugly clipping issues here too."

2500|$|Mr. Freeze {{appears in}} the 1997 film Batman & Robin, portrayed by Arnold Schwarzenegger. In the film, Dr. Victor Fries was in an {{accident}} in a cryogenics lab he was using {{to find a cure}} for his wife Nora Fries suffering from the terminal illness MacGregor's Syndrome and is now dependent on a diamond-powered subzero suit to keep cold or he would die. Mister Freeze crashes a charity event held by Wayne Enterprises and steals a diamond from the event. Mister Freeze is captured by Batman and detained at Arkham Asylum, but flees with the help of Poison Ivy and Bane. Ivy cuts off Nora's life support and deceives Mister Freeze into thiking that Batman was responsible for the deed as part of a plan to use him to <b>freeze</b> <b>up</b> Gotham City. With the use of a gigantic ray gun stationed in an observatory, he freezes over the entirety of Gotham. In a subsequent fight with Batman, Mr. Freeze destroys the observatory with a set of bombs (planted by Bane) in an unsuccessful attempt to take Batman with him. Batman shows Mr. Freeze a recording of Ivy during her fight with Batgirl in which she brags about killing Nora, revealing her real colours to him. Batman tells Mr. Freeze that his wife is not dead; she was restored and moved to Arkham, where he can complete his research. Batman asks him for the cure he created for the first stage of MacGregor's Syndrome for Alfred Pennyworth; Mr. Freeze atones for his past actions by giving Batman the medicine he had developed. Freeze is then detained at Arkham where he exacts his revenge on Ivy for her deception and trechery. The character's penchant for cold and ice-related puns was noted by critics. James Berardinelli of Reelviews commented that [...] "Schwarzenegger, aside from looking like a cross between the Michelin Man and Robocop, appears totally confused about what he's doing. Sometimes he's in Terminator mode; on other occasions, he's chomping on a cigar like he's back in Last Action Hero." [...] He also noted that Freeze's backstory and motivation were [...] "too complex for Schwarzenegger to convey effectively or for [...] Schumacher to care about exploring. As a result, Mr. Freeze ends up being a frustratingly incomplete brute who's out to smother Gotham City under a blanket of ice." [...] Robin Dougherty of Salon lamented that [...] "Schwarzenegger’s exuberance is pinned down. He’s like a moth squashed by an 18-wheeler. He’s also paralyzed by amazingly inert dialogue. How many lame jokes about cold can you fit into two hours? Buy a ticket and find out." [...] Patrick Stewart was considered for the role, before the script was rewritten to accommodate Schwarzenegger's casting. Schumacher decided that Mr. Freeze must be [...] "big and strong like he was chiseled out of a glacier". Schwarzenegger was paid a $25 million salary for the role. His prosthetic makeup and wardrobe took six hours to apply each day.|$|E
