40|$|Three {{methods are}} being {{developed}} for keeping water from freezing during high-altitude climbs so that mountaineers can remain hydrated. Three strategies have been developed. At {{the time of this}} reporting two needed to be tested in the field and one was conceptual. The first method is Passive Thermal Control Using Aerogels. This involves mounting the fluid reservoir of the climber s canteen to an inner layer of clothing for better heat retention. For the field test, bottles were mounted to the inner <b>fleece</b> <b>layer</b> of clothing, and then aerogel insulation was placed {{on the outside of the}} bottle, and circumferentially around the drink straw. When climbers need to drink, they can pull up the insulated straw from underneath the down suit, take a sip, and then put it back into the relative warmth of the suit. For the field test, a data logger assessed the temperatures of the water reservoir, as well as near the tip of the drink straw. The second method is Passive Thermal Control with Copper-Shielded Drink Straw and Aerogels, also mounted to inner layers of clothing for better heat retention. Braided wire emanates from the inside of the fleece jacket layer, and continues up and around the drink straw in order to use body heat to keep the system-critical drink straw warm enough to keep water in the liquid state. For the field test, a data logger will be used to compare this with the above concept. The third, and still conceptual, method is Active Thermal Control with Microcontroller. If the above methods do not work, microcontrollers and tape heaters have been identified that could keep the drink straw warm even under extremely cold conditions. Power requirements are not yet determined because the thermal environment inside the down suit relative to the external environment has not been established. A data logger will be used to track both the external and internal temperatures of the suit on a summit day...|$|E

50|$|The time of {{year the}} sheep will start {{shedding}} their wool, is heavily determined by the weather. A good warm spring, with good growth may trigger the shedding as early as late May, whereas a long cold and wet spring and summer, might not trigger the shedding until late July or in a few instances early August. If the sheep are gathered for shearing at a prime moment, then the fleece will easily part from the body by only sliding a hand betwixt {{the old and new}} <b>fleece</b> <b>layers.</b> The shorn <b>fleece</b> consists of two layers, the inner layer being fine, lanolin rich wool, perfect for underwear and other fine garments. The outer layer made up of coarse long hairs, traditionally used for heavy duty clothing, such as thick sweaters for fishermen, or even some early arctic explorers.|$|R
40|$|Physical {{processes}} to hydrophilisation of polymer surfaces, such as atmospheric (barrier discharge) and low pressure plasma (glow discharge) treatments, are of increasing {{interest for the}} textile industry. This is related to their compatibility with the environment and their innovative potential thus enabling {{the development of new}} products by unconventional methods. If depth effective hydrophilisation is targeted, plasma-based processes are not suitable yet, since the depth effect of plasma treatments on textiles is hardly investigated up to know. In case of request for homogeneously treated textile materials, e. g., for application in the filter manufacturing industry or if for instance in the field of sportswear heterogeneously finished textiles are demanded, an insufficiently controlled depth effect might reduce the quality of the products and thereby diminishes the industrial applicability of the process. In this work investigations on the plasma-based hydrophilisation of PP and PET fleece under normal and reduced pressure with special regard to the depth effect will be presented. In order to determine the depth effect, a layer model consisting of 10 layers of the respective textile substrate which simulates a fleece of high coating weight per unit area was developed. The layer model was low pressure plasma treated using oxygen as plasma gas and atmospheric plasma treated using air as plasma gas by simultaneous variation of the treatment parameters. Afterwards each layer of the model was examined by wettability tests to determine the depth efficacy of the treatment. Plasma induced chemical modifications of the <b>fleece</b> <b>layers</b> were determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and topical modifications of the fleece fibres were investigated by scanning electron microscopy, white light interferometry and atomic force microscopy. The results were compared to those achieved for untreated material. Both glow discharge and barrier discharge plasma treatment led to a recognizable hydrophilisation of all <b>fleece</b> <b>layers</b> of the layer model, regardless of the utilised textile substrate of the plasma process...|$|R
40|$|A {{precision}} {{measurement of}} the cosmic-ray positron spectrum may help to solve the puzzle {{of the nature of}} dark matter. Pairwise annihilation of neutralinos, predicted by some supersymmetric extensions to the standard model of particle physics, may leave a distinct feature in the cosmic-ray positron spectrum. As the available data are limited both in terms of statistics and energy range, we are developing a balloon-borne detector (PEBS) with a large acceptance of 4000 cm^ 2 sr. A superconducting magnet creating a field of 0. 8 T and a tracking device consisting of scintillating fibers of 0. 25 mm diameter with silicon photomultiplier readout will allow rigidity and charge determination to energies above 100 GeV. The dominant proton background is suppressed by the combination of an electromagnetic calorimeter and a transition radiation detector consisting of <b>fleece</b> <b>layers</b> interspersed with straw-tube proportional counters. The calorimeter uses a sandwich of tungsten and scintillating fibers that are again read out by silicon photomultipliers.

5000|$|Firstly, {{the cold}} is {{protected}} against with clothing of {{three types of}} layers as follows: a liner layer against the camper's skin (longjohns), an insulation <b>layer</b> (<b>fleece),</b> and a water- and wind-proof outer shell. Although cotton {{is one of the}} best quality fabrics there is, it is not recommended to be worn on winter camping because if it gets wet it dries out very slowly and the wearer could freeze. Rather than cotton, winter campers should wear wool or synthetic materials. The boots must be waterproof and the head must be protected against the cold. Although it seems a good choice, campers are advised not to wear too many pairs of socks as they might restrict blood flow to the feet, resulting in cold feet. Gaiters should also be worn to avoid snow and rain wetting the boots.|$|R
