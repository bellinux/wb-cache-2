The {{efficiency of the}} CRL-MWCNTs biocatalysts to catalyze the esterification production of <b>geranyl</b> <b>propionate</b> (solvent log P, alcohol:acid molar ratio and thermal stability) was compared with the free CRL for parameters. The use of CRL-MWCNTs in n-heptane (log P 4. 0) and alcohol:acid molar ratio of 5 : 1 resulted in a 2 -fold increased conversion frequency {{as compared to the}} free CRL for the production of <b>geranyl</b> <b>propionate,</b> in addition to a noteworthy 2 -fold enhanced thermal stability...|$|E
40|$|Terpene esters of short-chain {{fatty acids}} are {{essential}} oils that have big importance in food, cosmetic and pharmaceutical industries as flavours and fragrances. Geraniol and citronellol {{are the most}} important substances. Considering the everincreasing demand for such products, their enzymatic production from natural raw materials by using environmentally friendly and economically attractive processes may prove advantageous. In this contribution, we would like to present an alternative option for the production of <b>geranyl</b> <b>propionate</b> using nanobioconjugates consisting of Candida rugosa lipase adsorbed onto multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CRL-MWCNTs). We investigated the effects of incubation time, temperature, solvent log P and substrate molar ratio, and determined the optimum conditions. The yield of <b>geranyl</b> <b>propionate</b> catalysed by CRL-MWCNTs nanobioconjugates was significantly influenced by two factors, namely, temperature and time of the reaction. Under the optimum reaction conditions of 55 C, solvent n-heptane (log P D 4. 0), geraniol to propionic acid molar ratio of 5 : 1 and reaction time of 6 h, the use of CRL-MWCNTs resulted in 51. 3 % production of <b>geranyl</b> <b>propionate.</b> Therefore, the investigation revealed that <b>geranyl</b> <b>propionate</b> was successfully synthesized under mild conditions with reasonably high yield within a short period of time. The CRL-MWCNTs nanobioconjugates demonstrated a potential as economical and environmentally smarter biocatalysts for the production of <b>geranyl</b> <b>propionate...</b>|$|E
40|$|In view {{of several}} {{disadvantages}} {{as well as}} adverse effects {{associated with the use}} of chemical processes for producing esters, alternative techniques such as the utilization of enzymes on multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs), have been suggested. In this study, the oxidative MWCNTs prepared using a mixture of HNO 3 and H 2 SO 4 (1 : 3 v/v) were used as a supportive material for the immobilization of Candida rugosa lipase (CRL) through physical adsorption process. The resulting CRL-MWCNTs biocatalysts were utilized for synthesizing <b>geranyl</b> <b>propionate,</b> an important ester for flavoring agent as well as in fragrances. Enzymatic esterification of geraniol with propionic acid was carried out using heptane as a solvent and the efficiency of CRL-MWCNTs as a biocatalyst was compared with the free CRL, considering the incubation time, temperature, molar ratio of acid:alcohol, presence of desiccant as well as its reusability. It was found that the CRL-MWCNTs resulted in a 2 -fold improvement in the percentage of conversion of <b>geranyl</b> <b>propionate</b> when compared with the free CRL, demonstrating the highest yield of <b>geranyl</b> <b>propionate</b> at 6 h at 55 °C, molar ratio acid: alcohol of 1 : 5 and with the presence of 1. 0 g desiccant. It was evident that the CRL-MWCNTs biocatalyst could be reused for up to 6 times before a 50 % reduction in catalytic efficiency was observed. Hence, it appears that the facile physical adsorption of CRL onto F-MWCNTs has improved the activity and stability of CRL as well as served as an alternative method for the synthesis of <b>geranyl</b> <b>propionate...</b>|$|E

40|$|Lipases {{produced}} by a newly isolated Sporidiobolus pararoseus strain have potential catalytic ability for esterification reactions. After production, the enzymatic extracts (conventional crude and precipi-tated, ‘CC ’ and ‘CP’, and industrial crude and precipitated, ‘IC ’ e ‘IP’) were partially characterized. The enzymes presented, in general, higher specificity for short chain alcohols and fatty acids. The precipitated extract showed a good thermal stability, higher than that for crude enzymatic extracts. The ‘CC ’ and ‘CP ’ enzymes presented high activities after exposure to pH 6. 5 and 40 °C. On the other hand, the ‘IC ’ and ‘IP ’ extracts kept their activities {{in a wide range}} of pH memory but presented preference for higher reaction temperatures. Preliminary studies of application of the crude lipase ex-tract in the enzymatic production of <b>geranyl</b> <b>propionate</b> using geraniol and propionic acid as sub-strates in solvent-free system led to a reaction conversion of 42 1. 5 %.

40|$|The topical, {{fumigant}} and ovicidal {{activity of}} fourteen monoterpenoids and thirty-one monoterpenoid derivatives were evaluated using the house fly, Musca domestica. The toxicity data of acyclic, monocyclic, and tricyclic phenols, alcohols, and ketones {{were compared to}} determine structure-activity relationships involving the monoterpenoids 2 ̆ 7 structural shape, type of functional group, and degree of saturation. Monoterpenoid acetate, propionate, pivalate, trichloroacetate, and trifluoroacetate derivatives were synthesized and their insecticidal activities were evaluated. The toxicities of the monoterpenoid acetate and haloacetate derivatives were compared {{with each other and}} the parent alcohols or phenols to evaluate the influence of derivatization on toxicity. Monoterpenoid ketones were more insecticidal than alcohols in the topical and ovicidal bioassays. Pivalate and acetate derivatives were more toxic than the haloacetate derivatives in both the topical and ovicidal bioassays. Thymyl trifluoroacetate was the most effective fumigant followed by menthol and fenchone. Thymol and geranyl acetate were the most insecticidal monoterpenoid and monoterpenoid derivative in the topical bioassays.
