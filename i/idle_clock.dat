Kidd could see the finger of the dial stand up dark against the sky like the dorsal fin of a shark and the vain moonlight clinging to that <b>idle</b> <b>clock.</b> But he saw something else clinging to it also, for one wild moment--the figure of a man.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sparse Matrix-Vector Multiplication (SMVM) is the {{critical}} computational kernel of many iterative solvers for systems of sparse linear equations. In this paper we propose an FPGA design for SMVM which interleaves CRS (Compressed Row Storage) format so that just a single floating point accumulator is needed, which simplifies control, avoids any <b>idle</b> <b>clock</b> cycles and sustains high throughput. For {{the evaluation of the}} proposed design we use a RASC RC 100 blade attached to a SGI Altix multiprocessor architecture. The limited memory bandwidth of this architecture heavily constraints the performance demonstrated. However, the use of FIFO buffers to stream input data makes the design portable to other FPGA-based platforms with higher memory bandwith...|$|E

The Desna APU is based on the 9-watt Ontario APU. Energy savings were achieved by lowering the CPU, GPU and northbridge voltages, reducing the <b>idle</b> <b>clocks</b> of the CPU and GPU as well as introducing a hardware thermal control mode. A bidirectional turbo core mode was also introduced.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} {{collection}} of results about the clock in Feynman's computer construction and Kitaev's Local Hamiltonian problem. First, by analyzing the spectra of quantum walks on a line with varying endpoint terms, we find a better lower bound on the gap of the Feynman Hamiltonian, which translates into a less strict promise gap requirement for the QMA-complete Local Hamiltonian problem. We also translate this result into the language of adiabatic quantum computation. Second, introducing an <b>idling</b> <b>clock</b> construction with a large state space but fast Cesaro mixing, we provide a way for achieving an arbitrarily high success probability of computation with Feynman's computer with only a logarithmic {{increase in the number}} of clock qubits. Finally, we tune and thus improve the costs (locality, gap scaling) of implementing a (pulse) clock with a single excitation. Comment: 32 page...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA {{continuous}} {{increase in}} the number of transistors mounted on a single chip brings about the need for power optimization. In this era, where technologies such as smart grid are developed, scope for power optimisation is increasing. Smart grid is an integration of essential building blocks such as sensor system, control units into existing power systems which could be implemented as a Silicon on Chip (SoC) in Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) circuits. VLSI circuits can be both combinational and sequential. In sequential circuits clock is the major source of dynamic power consumption. The technique of clock gating is used to reduce the clock power consumption by cutting off the <b>idle</b> <b>clock</b> cycles. In this paper, we propose aVHDL-based technique, to insert clock gating circuit and also the dynamic power due to this is estimated. This model has been implemented onto ISCAS’ 89 sequential circuits that have been compiled using Modelsim Altera 13. 1, and the Xilinx ISE tool is used to simulate and analyze power. The results show that the dynamic power is reduced for the sequential benchmark circuits considered...|$|E
40|$|Motivation: In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} {{increased}} interest in producing large and accurate phylogenetic trees using statistical approaches. However for a large number of taxa, it is not feasible to construct large and accurate trees using only a single processor. A number of specialised parallel programs have been produced in an attempt to address the huge computational requirements of maximum likelihood. We express a number of concerns about the current set of parallel phylogenetic programs which are currently severely limiting the widespread availability and use of parallel computing in maximum likelihood based phylogenetic analysis. Results: We have identified the suitability of phylogenetic analysis to large-scale heterogeneous distributed computing. We have completed a distributed and fully crossplatform phylogenetic tree building program called DPRml. It uses an already proven maximum likelihood based tree building algorithm and a popular phylogenetic analysis library for all its likelihood calculations. It offers one of the most extensive sets of DNA substitution models currently available. We are the first, to our knowledge, to report the completion of a distributed phylogenetic tree building program that can achieve near linear speedup while only using the <b>idle</b> <b>clock</b> cycles of machines. For those in an academic or corporate environment with hundreds of idle desktop machines, we have shown how distributed computing can deliver a ‘free ’ ML supercomputer.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, a novel {{low power}} {{adaptive}} pulse triggered flip-flop (PTFF) featuring exclusive-or gate based clock gating with replica path delay scheme is proposed. Clock gating {{is a very}} accepted technique to reduce dynamic power of <b>idle</b> <b>clocking</b> subsystems. Incorporating clock gating with PTFF leads to reduction in dynamic power consumption and replica path delay pulse generator simplifies design effort and achieves robust timing characteristics {{as compared to the}} conventional PTFF. The proposed PTFF features best power delay product performance. This scheme is implemented using CMOS 90 nm BSIM 4 technology file in Synopsys HSPICE. Simulation results indicate that the proposed design excels conventional designs in performance metrics such as average power consumption, minimum D to Q delay, and power-delay-product. The average power consumption of the proposed design reduces by 51 % as compared to replica-path pulse triggered flip-flop for 100 % switching activity...|$|R

25|$|Some devices {{even have}} minor variances from the CPOL/CPHA modes {{described}} above. Sending data from slave to master {{may use the}} opposite clock edge as master to slave. Devices often require extra <b>clock</b> <b>idle</b> time before the first clock or after the last one, or between a command and its response. Some devices have two clocks, one to read data, and another to transmit it into the device. Many of the read clocks run from the chip select line.|$|R

Active leakage control method reduces leakage power by dynamically disconnecting supply to inactive blocks and adjusting body bias to further limit leakage and maintain performance. The active leakage control scheme is advantageous for blocks with low activity factors and relatively long <b>idle</b> periods. A <b>clock</b> distribution tree, an 8 -bit carry look-ahead adder, an 8 -bit address decoder, and a SRAM cell were simulated i...|$|R

In the <b>idle</b> state the <b>CLOCK</b> and DATA lines are high but with the arrival of the first falling edge the transmission mode is evoked and the similarly the data bits are transmitted sequentially starting with the MSB with every rising edge. The transmission of the LSB means that the transmission of the data is completed. An additional rising edge pushes the data line to LOW signifying the end of transmission of the particular data.|$|R
30|$|Clock {{synchronization}} [19] {{mechanisms are}} necessary to ensure the timeliness occurrence of timing events in using state-based schedules. Due to clock drifts, stations may be de-synchronized in making decisions, and therefore, faulty decisions will occur. We use a clock synchronization algorithm [20] that considers the worst-case network delay instead of the average network delay. The synchronization takes place when the medium is idle for long periods so that synchronization messages do {{not interfere with the}} communication messages. If stations make intensive use of the medium and it almost never gets <b>idle,</b> then the <b>clock</b> synchronization happens locally based on previous updates.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a {{technique}} for synthesizing low-power systems from a high-level specification. We an-alyze the control flow of the specification to detect mutually exclusive sections of the computation. A selectively-clocked interconnection of interacting FSMs is automatically gener-ated and optimized where each FSM controls the execution of one section of computation. Only one of the interacting FSMs is active at any given clock cycle, while all the others are <b>idle</b> and their <b>clock</b> is stopped. Our interacting FSM im-plementation achieves consistently lower power dissipation than the functionally equivalent monolithic implementation. In average 37 % power savings are obtained with a 30 % area overhead. ...|$|R
2500|$|Like their mobile K6-2+/III+ predecessors, the CPUs {{were capable}} of dynamic clock {{adjustment}} for power optimization, and also {{was the reason for}} the unlocked multiplier. When the system is <b>idle,</b> the CPU <b>clocks</b> itself down via lower bus multiplier and selects a lower voltage. When a program demands more computational resources, the CPU quickly (there is some latency) returns to an intermediate or maximum speed with appropriate voltage to meet the demand. This technology was marketed as [...] "PowerNow!" [...] and was similar to Intel's SpeedStep power saving technique. The feature was controlled by the CPU, motherboard BIOS, and operating system. AMD later renamed the technology to Cool'n'Quiet on their K8-based CPUs (Athlon 64, etc.), and introduced it for use on desktop PCs as well.|$|R
30|$|The CU also {{internally}} communicates {{with every}} module in sequence for efficient data transfer with the card. The common signals {{for all the}} modules are Reset, CS, and clock signal. The CS and clock signals are also supplied to the card via multiplexer. Once Reset signal is received by CU, it issues a START signal to the CINM along with the clock signal. CU also issues START and clock signal for the other modules when {{they are about to}} initiate their action. In <b>idle</b> state, no <b>clock</b> is received by the modules and thus they work in power saving mode. Once a module receives a START signal, it acknowledges so by issuing a READY signal to the CU and starts working. After every successful completion of the work, the module intimates CU with DONE signal.|$|R

N/PBTI-induced degrada-tion depends heavily on workload, which causes imbalanced degradation and additional clock skew for clock distribution networks with clock gating features. In this work, we first analyze the effects of N/PBTI on clock paths with different clock gating use cases. Then cross-layer solutions are proposed to reduce N/PBTI-induced clock skew. Two Integrated Clock Gating (ICG) cell circuits are proposed to alternate <b>clock</b> <b>idle</b> state between logic high and logic low for each clock gating operation. A skew mitigation methodology is also proposed to select the appropriate ICG cells based on the architecture and microarchitecture context. An example of sleep scheduling is also described as a simple software-level technique that can be used in conjunction with BTI-Gater to avoid certain pathological aging scenarios. Our experiments show that BTI-Gater can balance the gated clock branches to close to 50 % signal duty ratio, while guaranteeing a glitch-free clock signal with easy-to-verify timing constraints. Results on commercial processors show that BTI-Gater can effectively reduce N/PBTI-induced clock skew of up to 17 ps, which can be converted to up to 19. 7 % leakage power saving compared to pure design guardbanding.
