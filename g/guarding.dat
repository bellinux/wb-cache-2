5|$|Males {{engage in}} mate <b>guarding</b> {{during the period}} females are most {{vulnerable}} to successful extra pair copulations. They usually stay close to their social mate, singing slowly {{on the side and}} following the mate while she is foraging or searching for a nesting site. The <b>guarding</b> behavior, though, may conflict with males’ pursuit of extra-pair fertilizations. It is not yet clear to what extent a male will prefer mate <b>guarding</b> over extra-pair fertilizations. Male retention studies have shown that removal of a male increases the chance of extra-pair offspring in the brood, suggesting that mate <b>guarding</b> reduces extra-pair fertilization attempts. The extra-pair fertilization rate nonetheless cannot be eliminated even if males are allowed to stay near their social mates during fertility risk period. Several hypotheses try to explain this phenomenon: females may be able to manage extra-pair mating even while its social mate is <b>guarding</b> it, or females may reject extra-pair copulation attempts by other males in the absence of male <b>guarding.</b>|$|E
