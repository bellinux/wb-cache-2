40|$|This study aims {{to develop}} a {{rainfall}} <b>field</b> <b>tracking</b> method for depth-area-duration (DAD) analysis and assess whether the proposed tracking methods are able to properly estimate the maximum average areal rainfall (MAAR) within the study area during a rainfall period. We proposed three different rainfall <b>field</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithms (Box-tracking, Point-tracking, Advanced point-tracking) and then applied them to the virtual rainfall field with 1 hr duration and also compared DAD curves of each method. In addition, we applied the three tracking methods and a traditional GIS-based tool to the typhoon ‘Nari ’ rainfall event of the Yongdam-Dam watershed and then assess applicability of the proposed methods for DAD analysis. The results showed that Box-tracking was much faster {{than the other two}} tracking methods in terms of searching for the MAAR but it was impossible to describe rainfall spatial pattern during its tracking processes. On the other hand, both Point-tracking and Advanced point-tracking provided the MAAR by considering the spatial distribution of rainfall fields. In particular, Advanced point-tracking estimated the MAAR more accurately than Point-tracking in the virtual rainfall field, which has two rainfall centers with similar depths. The proposed automatic rainfall <b>field</b> <b>tracking</b> methods can be used as effective tools t...|$|E

In this article, we present a new method for tracking swimmers by detecting variations in the magnetic field caused by the structure of pools. This method is complementary to inertial positioning, as it allows the direct extraction of position without requiring post-processing, and unlike inertial sensing which loses accuracy over time, magnetic <b>field</b> <b>tracking</b> becomes increasingly accurate towards the end of a length...|$|E

30|$|We have {{developed}} a generalized dynamic rainfall monitoring algorithm from limited non-linear attenuation measurements by utilizing the spatial sparsity and non-negativity of the rainfall field. We have formulated the dynamic rainfall monitoring algorithm as a constrained convex optimization problem. The performance of the developed algorithm is compared with the standard approaches like an EKF for the scenarios, where we have both perfect knowledge about the state model and an approximate state model. Numerical experiments show that the developed approach outperforms a simple EKF in scenarios, where the state model is not perfectly known. The proposed methodology can be equivalently implemented for dynamic <b>field</b> <b>tracking</b> in tomographic applications like MRI and microwave tomography, where we have path-integrated Gaussian measurements.|$|E
