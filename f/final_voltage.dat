The titanium oxide film contains an outer porous layer and an inner barrier layer, and the barrier layer of the slow-grown film is much thicker than that of the fast-grown film. For titanium oxide film formed in the potentiostatic mode, “flower-like ” crystalline grains are developed due to very high local current density at the local defect sites of titanium surface.

It includes an ignition voltage at low current densities and a constant <b>final</b> <b>voltage</b> at higher current densities. In this paper, the influence of the magnitude of the ignition voltage is evaluated. A lower voltage peak yields a shorter arc loop around the lower edge of the splitter plate and an earlier subdivision of the arc. A too high voltage hump makes arc splitting impossible. To show that special treatment of the arc roots is absolutely necessary, a com-paring simulation without an arc root model was performed.
