5|$|This is {{complicated}} by the fact that in some database interface programs (or even database implementations like Oracle's), NULL is reported as an <b>empty</b> <b>string,</b> and empty strings may be incorrectly stored as NULL.|$|E
5|$|This is {{not true}} for all {{database}} implementations. In an Oracle RDBMS for example NULL and the <b>empty</b> <b>string</b> are considered {{the same thing and}} therefore 'Fish ' || NULL || 'Chips' results in 'Fish Chips'.|$|E
5|$|A URI {{reference}} {{may take}} the form of a full URI, the scheme-specific portion of a full URI, a trailing component of a full URI, or the <b>empty</b> <b>string.</b> An optional fragment identifier, preceded by #, may be present at the end of a URI reference. The part of the reference before the # indirectly identifies a resource, and the fragment identifier identifies some portion of that resource.|$|E

5000|$|The above example also {{demonstrates}} that the operator [...] inserts new objects (using the default constructor) in the map if there isn't one associated with the key. So integral types are zero-initialized, strings are initialized to <b>empty</b> <b>strings,</b> etc.|$|R

25|$|The set of all finite strings {{over some}} fixed {{alphabet}} Σ forms a monoid with string concatenation as the operation. The <b>empty</b> <b>string</b> {{serves as the}} identity element. This monoid is denoted Σ∗ and is called the free monoid over Σ.|$|E
25|$|If a {{function}} takes, for example, 2 arguments, any extras are ignored. For user defined functions, if too few arguments are provided, additional one are added with {{the value of}} the <b>empty</b> <b>string</b> (""). A function may have a maximum of 62 arguments.|$|E
30|$|In this work, we {{performed}} more corrections on the corpus. We {{found a few}} sentences where <b>empty</b> <b>strings</b> were assigned a tag, {{as if they were}} tokens. This was mainly due to the problems with punctuation tokens from the original corpus, and we discarded such sentences.|$|R

5000|$|Similarly, Nulls {{are often}} {{confused}} with <b>empty</b> <b>strings.</b> Consider the [...] function, which returns {{the number of}} characters in a string.

25|$|Nondeterministic finite {{automaton}} with ε-moves (NFA-ε) {{is a further}} generalization to NFA. This automaton replaces the transition function with the one that allows the <b>empty</b> <b>string</b> ε as a possible input. The transitions without consuming an input symbol are called ε-transitions. In the state diagrams, they are usually labeled with the Greek letter ε. ε-transitions provide a convenient way of modeling the systems whose current states are not precisely known.|$|E
25|$|S1 (which is {{also the}} start state) {{indicates}} the state at which an even number of 0s has been input. S1 is therefore an accepting state. This machine will finish in an accept state, if the binary string contains an even number of 0s (including any binary string containing no 0s). Examples of strings accepted by this DFA are ε (the <b>empty</b> <b>string),</b> 1, 11, 11…, 00, 010, 1010, 10110, etc.|$|E
25|$|In databases, it is {{possible}} for a field not to have a value. It is then said to have a null value. For numeric fields it is not the value zero. For text fields this is not blank nor the <b>empty</b> <b>string.</b> The presence of null values leads to three-valued logic. No longer is a condition either true or false, but it can be undetermined. Any computation including a null value delivers a null result.|$|E

5000|$|Several {{cases of}} {{insertion}} are shown below, though more may exist. Note that r simply represents the root.

25|$|For {{a simple}} example, take the {{presentation}} {a | a3}. Writing A for the inverse of a, we have possible strings combining {{any number of}} the symbols a and A. Whenever we see aaa, or aA or Aa we may strike these out. We should also remember to strike out AAA; this says that since the cube of a is the identity element of G, so is the cube of the inverse of a. Under these conditions the word problem becomes easy. First reduce strings to the <b>empty</b> <b>string,</b> a, aa, A or AA. Then note that we may also multiply by aaa, so we can convert A to aa and convert AA to a. The {{result is that the}} word problem, here for the cyclic group of order three, is solvable.|$|E
25|$|In {{computer}} science, a trie, {{also called}} digital tree and sometimes radix tree or prefix tree (as {{they can be}} searched by prefixes), {{is a kind of}} search tree—an ordered tree data structure that is used to store a dynamic set or associative array where the keys are usually strings. Unlike a binary search tree, no node in the tree stores the key associated with that node; instead, its position in the tree defines the key with which it is associated. All the descendants of a node have a common prefix of the string associated with that node, and the root is associated with the <b>empty</b> <b>string.</b> Values are not necessarily associated with every node. Rather, values tend only to be associated with leaves, and with some inner nodes that correspond to keys of interest. For the space-optimized presentation of prefix tree, see compact prefix tree.|$|E
25|$|As {{a hacker}} in MIT's AI laboratory, Stallman worked on {{software}} {{projects such as}} TECO, Emacs for ITS, and the Lisp machine operating system (the CONS of 1974–1976 and the CADR of 1977–1979—this latter unit was commercialized by Symbolics and LMI starting around 1980). He would become an ardent critic of restricted computer access in the lab, which {{at that time was}} funded primarily by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency. When MIT's Laboratory for Computer Science (LCS) installed a password control system in 1977, Stallman found a way to decrypt the passwords and sent users messages containing their decoded password, with a suggestion to change it to the <b>empty</b> <b>string</b> (that is, no password) instead, to re-enable anonymous access to the systems. Around 20% of the users followed his advice at the time, although passwords ultimately prevailed. Stallman boasted of the success of his campaign for many years afterward.|$|E

500|$|Misunderstanding of how Null {{works is}} the cause of a great number of errors in SQL code, both in ISO {{standard}} SQL statements and in the specific SQL dialects supported by real-world database management systems.

[...] Null is defined by the SQL standard as different from both an <b>empty</b> <b>string</b> and the numerical value 0, however.
