40|$|The next {{generation}} of mobile networks is expected to utilise multiple radio access technologies, seamlessly integrated to form a heterogeneous wireless network. On the arrival of call request, the network operator must assign an access network to the user. A call request can {{be due to a}} new call initiated within a cell, an intra-system or inter-system <b>handover</b> <b>attempt.</b> Selecting the most optimal network from those available and controlling network access is an important consideration for ove rall network stability and QoS provisioning. This work proposes a policy based management system to control network access in a heterogeneous wireless network. A call admission control policy admits a new user based on the current load and service mix in each available network. We also present an adaptive handover capacity reservation scheme to maximise resource usage while limiting the drop call rate and number of unnecessary inter-system handover attempts as users move between cells within the same network...|$|E
40|$|Out of Quality of Service reasons, higher {{priority}} shall in cellular networks {{be assigned to}} ongoing connections than to new call attempts. This can be accomplished through reserving {{a portion of the}} bandwidth assigned to a cell exclusively for high priority connections. A low priority call is only admitted to a cell if the unoccupied bandwidth in the cell following the acceptance of the call exceeds or is equal to the reserved bandwidth. In order to improve the efficiency of the bandwidth reservation scheme, the amount of bandwidth to reserve can be made time-varying and adaptive towards the momentary network conditions. Subscriber movement predictions can be applied to obtain handover arrival rate estimations, which can be used as input to the bandwidth reservation allocation procedure. The subscribers can for instance be grouped according to speed and previous cells. In this paper, a Markovian analysis of such prediction-oriented grouping features will be performed. The probability for a new call attempt to be blocked and the probability for a <b>handover</b> <b>attempt</b> to fail, due to channel occupancies, will be calculated for a bandwidth reservation scheme with and without grouping features. The obtained analytical results will be validated using computer simulations. © 2006 IEEE...|$|E

30|$|As can be {{seen from}} Figure 5, the RLF rate {{increases}} as the hysteresis increases. This is because when the threshold of the handover parameter (hysteresis) increases, FUEs tend to stay in the camping femtocell, instead of handover to other femtocells, which may have better signals. Therefore, a bigger hysteresis results in less <b>handover</b> <b>attempts,</b> but the too late handovers may still happens with Algorithm 1, resulting in increased RLF ratio. The number of too early handovers increases as the hysteresis/TTT increases, but the trend of RLF ratio does not change for the small number of too early handover in total RLFs. It {{can be seen}} from Figure 5 that the gradient based mobility robustness optimization has a better performance than traditional scheme in terms of RLF ratio. Since Non-Uniform MRO has a heavy weighting in Too Late Handovers, the proposed non-uniform scheme results in a lower RLF ratio.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} initial steps, inherent in the planning procedure of cellular networks, is their segmentation in operational parts that is performed at different levels corresponding to the hierarchy and topology of the network. The major goal of this procedure is the efficient deployment of the system and management of the distributed segmented parts while minimizing the signaling overhead in the network. As we show here. it can take place even during the operational phase of the network when certain shortcomings appear. In this work, we present an approach based on graph theory for the segmentation of cellular networks at the Base Station Controller (BSC) level that achieves it significant increase in the performance of the network.

40|$|Abstract. Future {{cellular}} {{systems are}} expected to use multilayered, multisized cells to cover non-homogeneous populated areas. An example in literature is given by a 2 level hierarchical architecture in which an overlaying macrocell provides a group of overfow channels utilized when a microcell, which covers a densely populated area, {{is not able to}} accommodate a new call, or a handoverpom another microcell. The macrocell has the higher hierarchical position, meaning that it can receive handover requests @om microcells, lower in the hierarchy, as well aspom other macrocells. On the contrary, a call served by the macrocell cannot handover to a microcell. This paper proposes a Reversible Hierarchical Scheme characterized by the presence of <b>handover</b> <b>attempts</b> @om macrocells to microcells. The scheme is conceived so that the microcells are given the majority of the traflc load as they are able to operate with very high capacity, while the macrocells, having lower channel utilization, can better carry out their support task. An analytical study is carried out showing that the system performance can be improved, at the expense of relatively little increase of network control overhead, when compared with the classical, i. e.

30|$|As worst case, {{the minimum}} LTE {{bandwidth}} (1.4  MHz) {{has been selected}} in the first subfigure of Figure  7 a. It can be observed that the UDR is reduced by {{the implementation of the}} load balancing methods for all 4, 8, 16, and 32 users/femtocell users’ limitation. For the scenario of 32 users/femtocell, depending on the experienced users’ quality and demand, sometimes the femtocell allows less than 32 simultaneously connected users because there are no available resources. Likewise, some other times the femtocell allows 32 users even if they are not using all radio resources. The reason is related to the RRM configuration. According to this, all the algorithms have comparable average UDR value except the PLUS method. Those situations overload femtocells adjacent to the hotspot, and as a result, many <b>handover</b> <b>attempts</b> fail (dropped calls and outage connections appear) because those adjacent cells are already fully occupied (users or radio resources). It means that the PUS method will not properly work all the time, the same for the PLS method. However, this issue is successfully fixed, thanks to the PLUS method that combines both network indicators. Additionally, commercial femtocells could avoid this problem because most of them work with wider bandwidth (normally > 3  MHz).|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} a new {{technique}} for radio resource management applicable to dynamic satellite networks for multimedia applications is presented. It uses a dynamic channel reservation policy to map the application specific requirements for accepting and maintaining a call. A new service classification scheme is proposed for the future wireless multimedia systems. According to this, the definition of each service class {{is based on a}} range of different performance criteria for the call blocking and call dropping rates. This approach can be used for future multi-beam dynamic satellite constellation networks. It {{is based on the assumption}} that the user terminal inter spot-beam handoff times can be accurately predicted by the network during the call set-up phase. The call admission controller takes into account the performance requirements of the established connections and the affect of accepting a new call on the same spot-beam as well as the <b>handover</b> <b>attempts</b> from the neighbouring spot-beams. A simulation model was developed in OPNET modeler and statistics for the call blocking and call dropping probabilities under various traffic conditions were recorded. Simulation results for a typical Medium Earth Orbit (MEO) and a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellation are presented and the performance of the new algorithm is discussed. It is shown that this new approach gives a great flexibility to dynamically map different service classes requirements into the network performance characteristics...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} provide mobile {{worldwide}} communication services, cellular systems can {{be based on a}} multilayered, multisized cells architecture characterized by the use of different technologies. Satellites can cover lightly populated areas, as well as those areas where other means cannot be used (like the sea); ® xed base stations, with different transmission powers and thus different cell sizes, can cover relatively highly populated areas. As a result, a given area could simultaneously be served by more than one Base Station, and the structure of such a system must be carefully designed. A Hierarchical Architecture (HA) scheme is a possible solution. HA is based on a multilevel cell con ® guration: microcells (or even indoor picocells) cover more densely populated areas and are given the majority of the traf ® c load as they are able to operate with very high capacity, while overlaying macrocells (or satellitar cells) provide a group of over ¯ ow channels. Occasionally, when microcells are not able to satisfy channel requests, the over ¯ ow channels are consumed. HA schemes are divided in two categories: Reversible Hierarchical (RH) and Non Reversible (NRH). The difference is given by the handover directions between cells allowed. In a RH <b>handover,</b> <b>attempts</b> between macrocells and microcells occur in both directions.

Research on providing efficient vertical handover in-cludes either the proposal of novel solutions or adaptations into existing horizontal handover schemes. In this work, we propose a policy for Group Vertical <b>Handover</b> (GVHO) <b>attempts.</b> We apply such a policy to an existing GVHO scheme, which handles vertical group handover based on a threshold that limits handover blocking probability. Performance is evaluated through simula-tion under several scenarios. To provide more realistic situations, we consider channel holding time in our studies. In addition, we study the fraction of blocked nodes and we vary threshold values for blocking probability. We compare our solution to that of the studied GVHO scheme. Results show that our solution reduces the handover latency and the fraction of blocked nodes while maintaining the handover blocking probability under a predefined threshold. In particular, latency is reduced from 11 % to 51. 5 % in some of the scenarios studied. Keywords-GVHO; handover; policy of attempts. I...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} into the teletraffic modelling and performance of layered cellular networks that use overflow for new call and <b>handover</b> <b>attempts</b> in order to improve system performance It addresses the important problems how to model and analyse overflow in large cellular networks so that the overall impact across the network can be evaluated, the overflow policies that can be used with new calls and handovers to improve network performance and how these policies perform under a range of conditions. The general problem of modelling overflow in cellular networks is considered at length and from this it is concluded that the use of overflow in existing schemes such as directed retry, reuse partitioning and overlaid cells can also be described by the simple concepts of intra and inter layer overflow Using these concepts the author formulates the problem of overflow in layered networks as a subset of the general problem of overflow with multiple overflow routes and restricted overflow. This leads to the derivation of the mean and variance of the overflow traffic from a cell with multiple handover routes and restricted handover from the two-dimensional birth death model of the system. These expressions for the mean and variance are used in conjunction with the Equivalent Random Theory and splitting formulae {{in the development of the}} Splitting Formula Method or SF Method. The accuracy of three splitting formulae and a simple Poisson approximation are investigated and compared with simulation. From this we conclude that the splitting formulae of Akimaru and Takahashi and Wallstrom provide the best overall result. This method is used to solve the general problem of multiple user classes for an example two layer network. This leads to conclusions on the complex relationship between cell capacity, the proportion of uses that can access the microcells and the proportion of users that can overflow from the microcell to the macrocell. The Modified Splitting Formula Method is an extension of the SF Method that includes handovers and overflow for handovers. A user perceived measure of the effect of new call and handover blocking described by the probability of call failure augments the Modified SF method. This is then used to analyse five new call overflow policies for a three layer network under conditions of extended handover, restrictions on handover for calls in cells at the edge of layers and spatial offset between the peak of the traffic demand and the cell layout. The results give new and valuable insight into the behaviour of layered cellular networks with overflow and the trade-offs in performance that exist when designing and operating these networks...|$|R

50|$|In telecommunications, the dropped-call rate (DCR) is the {{fraction}} of the telephone calls which, due to technical reasons, were cut off before the speaking parties had finished their conversational tone and before {{one of them had}} hung up (dropped calls) This fraction is usually measured as a percentage of all calls.A call attempt invokes a call setup procedure, which, if successful, results in a connected call. A connected call may be terminated (disconnected) due to a technical reason before the parties making the call would wish to do so (in ordinary phone calls this would mean before either of the parties has hung up). Such calls are classified as dropped calls. In many practical cases this definition needs to be further expanded with a number of detailed specifications describing which calls exactly are counted as dropped, at what stage of the call setup procedure a call is counted as connected, etc. In modern telecommunication systems, such as cellular networks, the call setup procedure may be very complex and the point at which a call is considered successfully connected may be defined in a number of ways, thus influencing the way the dropped-call rate is calculated.The dropped-call rate in conventional (land-line) networks is extremely low and is significantly less than 0.01%. In mobile communication systems using radio channels the dropped-call rate is higher and may range for commercial networks between 0.1% and a few percent. The main reasons for dropped calls in mobile networks are lack of radio coverage (either in the downlink or the uplink), radio interference between different subscribers, imperfections in the functioning of the network (such as failed <b>handover</b> or cell-resellection <b>attempts),</b> overload of the different elements of the network (such as cells), etc.The dropped-call rate {{is one of the key}} performance indicators (KPI) used by the network operators to assess the performance of their networks. It is assumed to have direct influence on the customer satisfaction with the service provided by the network and its operator. The dropped-call rate is usually included, together with other technical parameters of the network, in a key performance indicator known as call retainability.The operators of telecommunication networks aim at reducing the call dropped rate as much as practical and affordable. In mobile networks this is achieved by improving radio coverage, expanding the capacity of the network and optimising the performance of its elements, all of which may require considerable effort and significant investments on the part of the network operator.|$|R
