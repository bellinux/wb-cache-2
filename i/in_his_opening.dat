5|$|The Liberals and PC party {{differed}} considerably on {{fiscal and}} tax policies. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> campaign speech at Massey Hall in Toronto, Diefenbaker contended that Canadians were overtaxed {{in the amount}} of $120 per family of four. Diefenbaker pledged to reduce taxes and castigated the Liberals for not reducing taxes despite the government surplus. St. Laurent also addressed tax policy <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> speech, in Winnipeg. St. Laurent noted that since 1953, tax rates had declined, as had the national debt, and that Canada had a reputation as a good place for investments. The Prime Minister argued that the cost of campaign promises made by the Progressive Conservatives would inevitably drive up the tax rate. Diefenbaker also assailed tight-money monetary policies which kept interest rates high, complaining that they were hitting Atlantic and Western Canada hard.|$|E
5|$|Harding's {{attitude}} toward business was {{that government should}} aid {{it as much as}} possible. He was suspicious of organized labor, viewing it as a conspiracy against business. He sought to get them to work together at a conference on unemployment that he called to meet in September 1921 at Hoover's recommendation. Harding warned <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> address that no federal money would be available. No important legislation came as a result, though some public works projects were accelerated.|$|E

This title saw Federer once again equal Nadal for the record of most ATP 500 titles won with 18.

At {{the start of the}} 1926–27 season, he captained a combined Sydney City team against a New South Wales country team, which included the then 18-year-old Bradman. Macartney scored 126 and Bradman 98 in a match viewed as a generational transition in Australian batting. He scored 114 <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> first-class match of the season, and took wickets in each of his four matches. Macartney totalled 243 runs at 40.50 and took 11 wickets at 17.82.|$|E

5|$|At {{the start}} {{of the rest of the}} 200203 season, Karthik began to make an {{imposing}} case for senior selection. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> match of the season for the Tamil Nadu Under-19s, he scored 227 in his team’s 392/7 against Goa, and after making a duck in the first innings against Hyderabad, he hit 126 not out in the second innings. He then registered his third century in four innings, cracking 235 against Andhra Pradesh. His form tapered off and he only made 111 runs in his next six innings, but was nevertheless called up to the senior team to make his first-class debut.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, and returned the opening kickoff to its 19-yard line. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> drive, Seminoles quarterback Drew Weatherford completed several long passes, including a long 37-yard strike from his own 48-yard line to drive the Seminoles' offense inside the Virginia Tech red zone. Once there, however, the Florida State offense began to struggle with the Virginia Tech defense, which had recovered somewhat from the initial shock of Weatherford's offensive success. On the three plays that followed Weatherford's 37-yard pass, Florida State managed only six positive yards, but this total was largely negated by a five-yard false start penalty that pushed FSU's offense backward. Facing a fourth down, Florida State coach Bobby Bowden sent in kicker Gary Cismesia to attempt a 31-yard field goal. The kick was successful, and the three points gave Florida State an early 30 lead with 11:06 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|Hobbs played {{just five}} {{first-class}} matches in 1921, when Australia toured England. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> first-class game, he played against the touring team, but tore the same thigh muscle injured in Australia. He missed the opening two Tests, but once recovered, scored a century for Surrey; as England trailed 2–0 in the five-Test series, the selectors chose {{him for the}} third Test. In the days approaching the match, played in Leeds, he suffered from increasing stomach pain but reluctantly played. On {{the first day of}} the match, he had to leave the field, and after a day of rest the pain worsened. He consulted Sir Berkley Moynihan, a prominent surgeon based in Leeds, who diagnosed acute appendicitis and operated the same day. In the opinion of the surgeon, Hobbs would not have lived another five hours without surgery. He missed the rest of the season.|$|E

5|$|Murray {{continued}} his winning streak at the Italian Open, beating Jeremy Chardy in straight sets <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> match, but then withdrew due to fatigue after having played nine matches {{in the space}} of 10 days. Murray then reached his third semifinal at the French Open, but lost to Djokovic in five sets after threatening a comeback from two sets to love down, ending his 15 match winning streak on clay. To start his grass court campaign, Murray went on to win a record tying fourth Queen's Club title, defeating the big serving South African Kevin Anderson in straight sets in the final. At the third grand slam of the year, the 2015 Wimbledon Championships, Murray dropped only two sets on his way to setting up a semifinal clash with Roger Federer.

5|$|Opening {{statements}} in McVeigh's trial began on April 24, 1997. The United States {{was represented by}} a team of prosecutors led by Joseph Hartzler. <b>In</b> <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> statement Hartzler outlined McVeigh's motivations, and the evidence against him. McVeigh, he said, had developed a hatred of the government during his time in the army, after reading The Turner Diaries. His beliefs were supported by what he saw as the militia's ideological opposition to increases in taxes and the passage of the Brady Bill, and were further reinforced by the Waco and Ruby Ridge incidents. The prosecution called 137witnesses, including Michael Fortier and his wife Lori, and McVeigh's sister, Jennifer McVeigh, all of whom testified to confirm McVeigh's hatred of the government and his desire to take militant action against it. Both Fortiers testified that McVeigh had told them of his plans to bomb the Alfred P. Murrah Federal Building. Michael revealed that McVeigh had chosen the date, and Lori testified that she created the false identification card McVeigh used to rent the Ryder truck.|$|E

5|$|Ronnie O'Sullivan then {{competed in}} the International Championship, cited as the biggest event in Asia, in Chengdu after beating James Cahill to qualify. Having battled to beat Ben Woollaston 6–4, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> match of the tournament, Ronnie sailed past his next two opponents, McGill and Li Hang, 6–1. This {{set up a meeting}} with Mark Williams, a man who had not beat O'Sullivan for 12 years, in the quarters; however, after falling 3–0 behind, Williams won the next 5 frames and {{eventually}} the match, 6–5. O'Sullivan next {{competed in the}} Champion of Champions where he was defending champion. O'Sullivan begun his defence with a 4–2 defeat of Stuart Bingham.

5|$|With the {{transition}} to hard courts after Wimbledon, Raonic made {{the quarterfinals of the}} Canadian Open, losing to Monfils, before falling to Murray for the fifth time in 2016 in the Cincinnati Masters semifinal. Raonic was the fifth seed at the US Open, but lost in the second round to Ryan Harrison, partly due to debilitating cramps. In September, cramps were cited as the reason for Raonic to miss Canada's Davis Cup tie against Chile. Later that month, Raonic failed to defend his title at the St. Petersburg Open, falling <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>opening</b> match to Youzhny. Raonic withdrew from the China Open prior to his semifinal match due to an ankle injury sustained in the quarterfinal.
