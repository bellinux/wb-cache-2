It has been specially designed to operate in real time with high correct detection and classification rates.

This framework allows easily mixing different nature information, gathering in a single step observation models, calibration, motion priors and interaction models. The inference of results is carried out with a novel optimization procedure that generates estimates of the maxima of the posterior distribution combining concepts from Gibbs and slice sampling. Experimental tests have shown excellent results for traffic-flow video surveillance applications {{that can be used to}} classify vehicles according to their length, width, and height. Therefore, this vision-based system can be seen as a good substitute to existing inductive loop detectors.|$|E
40|$|AbstractAgricultural {{land use}} is an {{artificial}} ecosystem. Insect pollinators are important keys to {{success of the}} agroecosystem. Converting natural landscapes to agricultural land, such as oil palm and rubber plantations, affects the insects. The research aims to study diversity and abundance of insect pollinators in three different agricultural land uses, i. e. oil palm plantation, rubber plantation, and jungle-rubber. Scan sampling method was used to explore the diversity of insect pollinators. Observations of the insects were conducted from 08. 00 to 10. 00  AM and 02. 00 to 04. 00 PM <b>in</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>days.</b> There were 497 individuals of insect pollinators collected, which belong to 43 species in three orders (Hymenoptera, Diptera, and Lepidoptera).

Insect pollinators in oil palm plantations were dominated by giant honey bee (Apis dorsata) and stingless bee (Trigona sp. [=aff.

The research upon which this paper is based, seeks to provide new insights into an overlooked form of demotic photography, revealing rich seams of imagery and offering new perspectives on working class coastal history. The paper provides an insight into commercial seaside photographic practice from 1860 - 1920, offering a visual exposition of the British seaside, as represented through the refracted lens of the ‘beach’ photographer – also often derogatorily referred to as a ‘Smudger’. The photographs are frequently evocative, drawing the viewer into a nostalgic past shaped by visual half-truths.

40|$|Diurnal {{changes of}} {{photosynthesis}} of winter wheat during grain filling stage under sprinkler and surface irrigation conditions were studied <b>in</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>days</b> {{to investigate the}} differences among photosynthesis features of different irrigation methods. Photosynthesis features including net photosynthesis rate, transpiration rate, stomatal conductance, intercellular CO 2 concentration of winter wheat flag leaves were measured using a portable LI- 6400 photosynthesis system under sprinkler and surface irrigation conditions. The results were as follows; compared with that under surface irrigation condition, the net photosynthesis rate of winter wheat flag leaves under sprinkler irrigation was increased, and the intercellular CO 2 concentration was reduced. The transpiration rate and stomatal conductance of winter wheat flag leaf under sprinkler irrigation condition were higher than those under surface irrigation condition at photosynthetic midday depression time, but were lower at other diurnal time (12 : 00 ~ 14 : 00). The photosynthetic midday depression under sprinkler and surface irrigation conditions was resulted from the stomatal limitation factor and nonstomatal limitation factor. Under sprinkler irrigation condition, it was predominantly due to the stomatal limitation factor caused by decreased photosynthetic capacity of mesophyll cells, while it was predominantly due to stomatal limitation under surface irrigation condition. The {{results indicated that the}} photosynthesis activity of mesophyll cells in winter wheat flag leaves under sprinkler irrigation was improved, which made the limiting factor of photosynthesis rate change from nonstomatal limitation to stomatal limitation gradually...|$|E

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the impacts of}} biophysical factors on light response of net ecosystem exchange (NEE), CO 2 flux was measured using the eddy covariance technique in a winter wheat field in the North China Plain from 2003 to 2006. A rectangular hyperbolic function was used to describe NEE light response. Maximum photosynthetic capacity (P max) was 46. 6 ± 4. 0 µmol CO 2 m(- 2) s(- 1) and initial light use efficiency (α) 0. 059 ± 0. 006 µmol µmol(- 1) in April-May, {{two or three times}} as high as those in March. Stepwise multiple linear regressions showed that P max increased with the increase in leaf area index (LAI), canopy conductance (g c) and air temperature (T a) but declined with increasing vapor pressure deficit (VPD) (P 25 °C or VPD> 1. 1 - 1. 3 kPa, NEE residual increased with the increase in T a and VPD (P< 0. 001), indicating that temperature and water stress occurred. When g c was more than 14 mm s(- 1) in March and May and 26 mm s(- 1) in April, the NEE residuals decline disappeared, or even turned into an increase in g c (P< 0. 01), implying shifts from stomatal limitation to non-stomatal limitation on NEE.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{mitigate}} the overheating problem in the warmer seasons, and thereby to improve thermal performance and energy efficiency of the Double-Skin Façade (DSF) system, this study introduced an innovative design approach involving the integration of thermal mass with the air channel of the conventional DSF. Then it proposed a numerical procedure to assess the thermal performance of DSF, and finally investigated the effect of thermal mass on the energy efficiency of such system. The initial step in the assessment procedure proposed the development of base-case models, which were able to predict temperature distribution in the DSF with a venetian blind. So too were the base-case models able to determine heating/cooling loads of the perimeter room for both the mechanically and naturally ventilated DSFs. In this procedure, building energy simulation software was used for base-case development; two distinct models were generated: an airflow model and a thermal model. The nodal, unidirectional airflow network method was applied {{in the case of}} the naturally ventilated DSF. The thermal model was a transient control volume method which found temperature distribution in discretized air-channel. The base-cases were verified at two levels: inter-model verification and verification relying on measurements from mechanically and naturally ventilated outdoor test-cells. At both levels, a generally fair agreement was obtained. After this, parametric studies pertaining to the energy performance of the system were conducted on the effect of thermal mass in unison with different air-channel configurations. Considerable energy load reductions were found when thermal mass was used in the air-channel, replacing venetian blind slats for mechanically ventilated DSFs; this held true during both summer and winter. In this configuration depending on the airflow path direction, energy savings from 21 % to 26 % in summer and from 41 % to 59 % in winter are achievable in compared with conventional DSF with aluminum venetian blind. The savings were found higher <b>in</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>days</b> than cloudy days. On the other hand, naturally ventilated DSFs combined with thermal mass were not found to be energy efficient in winter due to stack effect and airflow rate increase within the air channe...|$|E

Currently, companies that offer solar collectors, offer solar collectors complete set with all necessary equipments for the solar collector connection for hot water supply system, or for home heating operation system by the temperature difference of input and output.

Except the manual operation system the worst solar collector’s operation system is the operation system by time. Usually equipments of the operation system are primitive and those could not used for individual program for each day, so one program is used for all days of the solar collector’s operation time. Thereby the fact that the weekly average value of solar radiation is changes, and changes the sun sunshine hours, then it is not possible fully use the obtaining solar energy <b>in</b> <b>sunny</b> <b>days</b> and fully use the solar collectors operation time of spring and autumn periods, in this time the heat storage tank will be more cooled than heated.
