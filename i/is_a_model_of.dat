5|$|Before the Protestant Reformation, the {{crucifix}} was common in Western Christianity. It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the cross with Jesus crucified on it. The crucifix became the central ornament {{of the altar}} in the 13th century, a use that has been nearly universal in Roman Catholic churches until recent times.|$|E
5|$|Foucault's {{analysis}} of Las Meninas, although {{on one level}} a contribution to art history, is more about epistemology, specifically the 'cognitive status of the modern human sciences', based on the possibility, suggested by Ludwig Wittgenstein, that a picture <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> reality.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{was never}} a {{vigorous}} apologist for that tradition, he always maintained the standards of clarity and rigour which it prizes, and his work <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> all that is best in the tradition. It is brilliant, deep, and imaginative. It is also extraordinarily tight. There cannot be many critics of his work who have not thought of some objection to what he says, only to find, on looking for a relevant quotation {{to turn into a}} target, that Williams carefully presents his views in a way that precisely anticipates the objection.|$|E

25|$|Notice {{that the}} proof that L <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> ZFC only {{requires}} that V {{be a model}} of ZF, i.e. we do NOT assume that the axiom of choice holds in V.|$|E
25|$|Lydia Lubey — Lydia, 27, was George's love {{interest}} before the war; after he went away, she married Frank and they quickly had three children. She <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> peaceful domesticity and lends a much-needed cheerful air to several {{moments of the}} play.|$|E

25|$|If {{we define}} a {{homologue}} of <b>an</b> algebra to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the equational theory of that algebra, then a Boolean algebra {{can be defined}} as any homologue of the prototype.|$|R

25|$|Because {{both the}} L of L and the V of L {{are the real}} L and both the L of Lκ and the V of Lκ are the real Lκ, we get that V=L is true in L and in any Lκ that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> ZF. However, V=L does not hold in any other {{standard}} model of ZF.|$|E
25|$|While ACT <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> {{cognition}} in general, and not {{memory in}} particular, it nonetheless posits certain {{features of the}} structure of memory, as described above. In particular, ACT models memory as a set of related symbolic chunks which may be accessed by retrieval cues. While the model of memory employed in ACT is similar in some ways to a semantic network, the processing involved is more akin to an associative model.|$|E
25|$|A doll <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> a human (often a baby), a {{humanoid}} (like Bert and Ernie), or an animal. Modern dolls {{are often}} made of cloth or plastic. Other materials that are, or have been, {{used in the}} manufacture of dolls include cornhusks, bone, stone, wood, porcelain (sometimes called china), bisque, celluloid, wax, and even apples. Often people will make dolls out of whatever materials are available to them.|$|E

2500|$|In cybernetics, {{the good}} {{regulator}} or Conant–Ashby theorem is stated [...] "Every good regulator of <b>a</b> system must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> that system".

50|$|However, it is {{important}} to stress that cEAs <b>are</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> search, in many senses different from traditional EAs. Also, they can be run in sequential and parallel platforms, reinforcing the fact that the model and the implementation are two different concepts.|$|R
25|$|In Marcella Althaus-Reid's Liberation Theology and Sexuality, Marlene Dietrich, who is {{considered}} to be the first German-born actress to receive critical acclaim in Hollywood, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> liberation and subversion, as well as beauty, perfection and sensuality. In Rio de Janeiro, Althaus-Reid discovered a statue of Dietrich dressed as Our Lady of Aparecida in a gay bar in Copacabana beach. The image of Dietrich as the black Virgin Mary represents her overcoming duality. According to Althaus-Reid, it is a figure that sanctifies Dietrich while simultaneously liberating Mary.|$|E
25|$|The viable {{system model}} (VSM) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the {{organisational}} structure of any autonomous system {{capable of producing}} itself. A viable system is any system organised {{in such a way}} as to meet the demands of surviving in the changing environment. One of the prime features of systems that survive is that they are adaptable. The VSM expresses a model for a viable system, which is an abstracted cybernetic (regulation theory) description that is applicable to any organisation that is a viable system and capable of autonomy.|$|E
25|$|An {{armillary sphere}} (variations {{are known as}} spherical astrolabe, armilla, or armil) <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> objects in the sky (in the {{celestial}} sphere), consisting of a spherical framework of rings, centred on Earth or the Sun, that represent lines of celestial longitude and latitude and other astronomically important features such as the ecliptic. As such, it differs from a celestial globe, which is a smooth sphere whose principal purpose is to map the constellations. It was invented separately in ancient Greece and ancient China, with later use in the Islamic world and Medieval Europe.|$|E
25|$|A first-order {{structure}} that satisfies all sentences in <b>a</b> given theory <b>is</b> said to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> the theory. An elementary class is {{the set of}} all structures satisfying a particular theory. These classes <b>are</b> <b>a</b> main subject <b>of</b> study in <b>model</b> theory.|$|R

2500|$|The key step in forcing <b>is,</b> given <b>a</b> [...] {{universe}} , to find {{an appropriate}} object [...] not in [...] The resulting class of all interpretations of -names {{will turn out to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> [...] that properly extends the original [...] (since [...] ).|$|R
25|$|A {{reference}} {{model in}} general <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> something that embodies the basic goal or idea of something and {{can then be}} looked at as a reference for various purposes. A business reference model is a means to describe the business operations of an organization, independent of the organizational structure that perform them. Other types of business reference model can also depict {{the relationship between the}} business processes, business functions, and the business area’s business reference model. These reference model can be constructed in layers, and offer a foundation for the analysis of service components, technology, data, and performance.|$|E
25|$|The Cantor set {{can be seen}} as {{the compact}} group of binary sequences, and as such, it is endowed with a natural Haar measure. When {{normalized}} so that the measure of the set is 1, it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> an infinite sequence of coin tosses. Furthermore, one can show that the usual Lebesgue measure on the interval is an image of the Haar measure on the Cantor set, while the natural injection into the ternary set is a canonical example of a singular measure. It can also be shown that the Haar measure is an image of any probability, making the Cantor set a universal probability space in some ways.|$|E
25|$|Suppose V <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>model</b> <b>of</b> ZFC. Either V {{contains}} no strong inaccessible or, taking κ {{to be the}} smallest strong inaccessible in V, Vκ is a standard model of ZFC which {{contains no}} strong inaccessibles. Thus, the consistency of ZFC implies consistency of ZFC+"there are no strong inaccessibles". Similarly, either V contains no weak inaccessible or, taking κ to be the smallest ordinal which is weakly inaccessible relative to any standard sub-model of V, then Lκ is a standard model of ZFC which contains no weak inaccessibles. So consistency of ZFC implies consistency of ZFC+"there are no weak inaccessibles". This shows that ZFC cannot prove {{the existence of an}} inaccessible cardinal, so ZFC is consistent with the non-existence of any inaccessible cardinals.|$|E
