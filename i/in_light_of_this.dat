5|$|Around {{the same}} point as Hooker's approach, Hawker had been working upon the {{development}} of a replacement fighter aircraft for the Hawker Hunter, designated as the P.1121. However, the P.1121 was cancelled shortly after the publishing of the 1957 Defence White Paper, which had advocated a policy shift away from manned aircraft and towards missiles. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> cancellation, Hawker found itself with the available resources to commit to a new project, and thus decided to study the use of the projected Pegasus engine as a basis for a new military aeroplane that would be able to conform with an active NATO specification that sought a new Light Tactical Support Fighter to replace the Fiat G.91, particular attention was paid to meeting the specification's performance and load requirements.|$|E
5|$|As {{a player}} {{representative}} to the NHL Players Association since 1990, Linden was responsible for being the contact between his teammates and the NHLPA. He saw the experience {{as a chance to}} be involved in the business side of the sport. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> service, Linden was elected President of the NHLPA in June 1998. Consequently, Linden was actively involved in negotiations with Gary Bettman and the NHL on a new CBA that ended the 2004–05 lockout. This included a final meeting in January 2005 between Linden and Harley Hotchkiss, the chairman of the NHL Board of Governors, in an attempt to avoid losing the NHL season. Despite this meeting, a result was not found in time to keep the NHL from cancelling the 2004–05 season.|$|E
5|$|Following {{his term}} in the Senate, he {{returned}} to Henderson and resumed his law practice. He was a delegate to the Union National Convention in 1866. In 1867, he was again nominated to the U.S. Senate, but after several ballots over several months, the General Assembly had not elected him. Powell believed {{that many of the}} legislators had been elected as a result of election interference by Northern forces, and that their intent was to prevent Kentucky from electing a senator at all, diminishing her influence nationally. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> belief, he urged the Democrats to withdraw his name and nominate someone more palatable to Union sympathizers. This they did, putting forth the name of Garrett Davis, who was subsequently elected.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{following}} the first répétition générale of Giselle {{on the stage}} of the Paris Opéra, the danseuse Nathalie Fitz-James used her influence as the mistress of an influential patron of the theatre to have a pas inserted for herself into the ballet. Jean Coralli was required to quickly arrange a number for Fitz-James, which was arranged by Coralli as a pas de deux with the danseur Auguste Mabille serving as Fitz-James's partner. Coralli's original intentions were to have the ballet's composer Adolphe Adam supply the music for Fitz-James's pas, but by this time Adam was unavailable. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> Coralli chose a suite by the composer Friedrich Burgmüller's titled Souvenirs de Ratisbonne to fashion music for Fitz-James's required pas. This pas de deux, which was dubbed the Pas des paysans (or Peasant pas de deux), became part of the ballet's performance tradition.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, the Housing Act 1980 gave council tenants {{the right}} to buy their homes. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> a group of 1500 {{properties}} in the area was given Conservation Area status, and Plumbe's northern section of the estate was granted Article Four Direction by Michael Heseltine, Secretary of State for the Environment, preventing any alterations to the external appearances of the properties without planning permission, in recognition of its architectural and historic interest. St Mark's Church was meanwhile Grade II listed.

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> information, it is {{unlikely}} that Cairano, at his death, was able to pass on an artistic legacy to assure the survival of his studio, despite having trained his son and other co-workers, as well as artists such as Ambrogio Mazzola, whose Madonna and Child, signed and dated 1536 and preserved in the Victoria and Albert Museum in London, clearly shows the influence of Cairano's style from thirty years before. This appears to be a nostalgic and naive tribute to a master, who apparently had bequeathed an artistic footprint that his collaborators not only replicated tirelessly but also felt unable to evolve further.|$|E

5|$|On 31 January, {{an attempt}} was made to free Missouri with the {{assembled}} collection of tug boats and salvage ships. This attempt was ultimately unsuccessful, owing to an anchor from a previous wreck that had become embedded in Missouris hull. The extreme force generated by the tugs caused several two-inch cables made from wire rope to break, and the failed attempt also revealed that Missouri needed to lose more weight if the next attempt was to be successful. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> some additional changes were made for the next attempt, which included cutting the anchors and chains off the battleship—after they had been re-added at Wallin's request—and the inclusion of additional pontoons to help lighten Missouri even more. A second attempt was tentatively scheduled for 1 February.|$|E

5|$|By mid-1941, {{officials}} in the War Office and the British Army had taken the decision that light tanks were no longer {{to be used by}} the British Army due to their inferior weapons and armour, as well as their poor performance during the conflict. Consequently, the Mk VIII was obsolete by the time that any significant number of the tanks had been produced, and none ever saw combat. A number of plans were made by the War Office for the design <b>in</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> decision, including equipping reconnaissance units with them, or the unsuccessful idea of attaching wings to them so that aircraft could tow them as gliders into position to support airborne forces; eventually it was decided to hand over those tanks that had been built to the Royal Air Force for use in airfield defence. One variant on the Mk VIII was designed, the Alecto self-propelled gun which was to have mounted a howitzer and used as a close-support vehicle by airborne forces; however only a few were ever produced and they were never used in combat.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, Christian Selmer was impeached on 27 February; {{his cabinet}} members {{followed}} one by one, the last being impeached on 1 April. On 11 March, Selmer resigned. Two acting Prime Ministers {{were drawn from}} his cabinet; Ole Bachke from 11 to 29 March and Niels Mathias Rye from 29 March to 3 April. Then, a new cabinet led by Selmer's former Minister of Finance Christian Homann Schweigaard was formed, but in reality it stood no chance of surviving as it faced the Liberal-dominated Parliament, whose means of pressuring the executive branch had been strengthened following the Impeachment trial. In June, as Schweigaard entered his last month as Prime Minister, the King summoned mathematics professor Ole Jacob Broch to form a compromise cabinet, but this failed owing to Conservative opposition, spearheaded by up-and-coming politician Emil Stang. Broch gave up on 22 June, and Johan Sverdrup became Prime Minister on 26 June. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> change in circumstances, the case against Hol had been annulled by Royal Resolution earlier on 6 June.|$|E
5|$|The {{first known}} dromaeosaurid with {{definitive}} evidence of feathers was Sinornithosaurus, reported from China by Xu et al. in 1999. Many other dromaeosaurid fossils {{have been found}} with feathers covering their bodies, some with fully developed feathered wings. Microraptor even shows evidence of a second pair of wings on the hind legs. While direct feather impressions are only possible in fine-grained sediments, some fossils found in coarser rocks show evidence of feathers {{by the presence of}} quill knobs, the attachment points for wing feathers possessed by some birds. The dromaeosaurids Rahonavis and Velociraptor have both been found with quill knobs, showing that these forms had feathers despite no impressions having been found. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> it is most likely that even the larger ground-dwelling dromaeosaurids bore feathers, since even flightless birds today retain most of their plumage, and relatively large dromaeosaurids, like Velociraptor, are known to have retained pennaceous feathers. Though some scientists had suggested that the larger dromaeosaurids lost some or all of their insulatory covering, the discovery of feathers in Velociraptor specimens has been cited as evidence that all members of the family retained feathers.|$|E

5|$|Tracking west-{{northwest}} {{and later}} northwest around the southwestern {{edge of a}} subtropical ridge, steady intensification of the cyclone ensued. Early on August27, a reconnaissance plane measured a central pressure of 994mbar (hPa; 29.36inHg) and flight-level winds of , indicating the system had become a tropical storm. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> the JTWC assigned the name Agnes to the storm. Additionally due to its proximity to the Philippines, the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration dubbed the system with the local name Pining. Strengthening occurred at a climatological rate, with Agnes attaining typhoon-status on August29. A large, banding eye-feature developed within the core of Agnes as it approached the Ryukyu Islands of southwestern Japan. The storm passed 170km (105mi) south of Okinawa around 06:00UTC on August30 and emerged over the East China Sea. Early on August31, Agnes achieved its peak strength with winds of 175km/h (110mph) and an estimated central pressure of 947mbar (hPa; 27.96inHg). This ranked it as a Category2-equivalent on the Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale. The JMA estimated the system to have been slightly weaker, with ten-minute sustained winds of 150km/h (90mph) and a pressure of 950mbar (hPa; 28.05inHg).|$|E
5|$|The Australians were {{initially}} employed on operations inside Phuoc Tuy Province during Operation Toan Thang I. Viet Cong activity in their traditional base {{areas in the}} Hat Dich north of Nui Thi Vai hills, had been increasing in February and March and 3 RAR subsequently commenced operations along the north-western border of Phuoc Tuy Province on 21 April. These operations resulted in little contact. <b>In</b> <b>light</b> <b>of</b> <b>this,</b> the Commander Australian Forces Vietnam—Major General Arthur MacDonald—believed that the task force would be better employed against North Vietnamese conventional forces, rather than in local pacification operations; later, following a request from Weyand, 1 ATF would again redeploy outside the province. As such, in an operation similar to those three months earlier at Bien Hoa, it was planned that 1 ATF {{would be used to}} help block infiltration towards Saigon. Overall responsibility for the defence of the capital was assigned to US IIFFV, and included the US 1st, 9th and 25th Divisions, as well as the US 199th Light Infantry Brigade, 1 ATF, and a number of South Vietnamese units. The main deployment began on 25 April in response to intelligence reports of another impending offensive, with 1 ATF headquarters established at the American base at Bearcat, while 2 RAR and 3 RAR deployed to the Bien Hoa-Long Khanh border to block likely infiltration routes east of the large American base complex at Long Binh, which included the airbase at Bien Hoa and the large Long Binh Logistics Depot. Meanwhile, the task force base at Nui Dat was defended by one infantry battalion, a squadron of tanks and the remainder of the cavalry. The SAS squadron also remained in Phuoc Tuy during this period, continuing reconnaissance and surveillance operations in the province.|$|E
