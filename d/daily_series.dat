40|$|Aim of this {{research}} is to study stochastic characteristics of <b>daily</b> rainfall <b>series.</b> The study was undertaken using 25 years (1977 - 2001) data of Purajaya region. The <b>series</b> of the <b>daily</b> rainfall data assumed was trend free. The periodic components of <b>daily</b> rainfall <b>series</b> were represented by using 253 harmonic expressions and stochastic components of <b>daily</b> rainfall <b>series</b> were presented using second order autoregressive parameters. Validation of generated <b>daily</b> rainfall <b>series</b> was done by comparing between generated with measured <b>daily</b> rainfall <b>series.</b> For periodic modeling, mean of the correlation coefficient between generated and measured <b>daily</b> rainfall <b>series</b> with the number of the data N is equal to 512 days for 25 years was found to be 0, 9576. For periodic and stochastic modeling, mean of the correlation coefficient was found to be 0. 9999. Therefore, developed periodic and stochastic model could be used for future prediction of <b>daily</b> rainfall time <b>series.</b> Keyword: <b>daily</b> rainfall, fast fourier transform, fourier analysis, autoregressive model, least squares method...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that many {{economic}} data series show chaotic behaviors. In this Letter, we further investigate the complex dynamical behaviors of the <b>daily</b> data <b>series,</b> including opening quotation, closing quotation, maximum price, minimum price, and total exchange quantum, in Shenzhen stock exchange and Shanghai stock exchange, which are two representative stock exchanges in mainland China. The maximum Lyapunov exponents, correlation dimensions, and frequency spectra are calculated for these time series. Our results indicate that some <b>daily</b> data <b>series</b> of stock exchanges display low-dimensional chaotic behaviors, and some other <b>daily</b> data <b>series</b> do not show any chaotic behavior. Moreover, we introduce a weighted one-rank local-region approach for predicting short-term <b>daily</b> data <b>series</b> of stock exchange...|$|R

40|$|<b>Daily</b> {{precipitation}} <b>series</b> at {{station or}} local scales {{is a critical}} input for rainfall-runoff modelling which, in turn, plays {{a vital role in}} the assessment of climate change impact on hydrologic processes and many other water resource studies. Future climate projected by General Circulation Models (GCMs) presents averaged values in large scales. Therefore, downscaling techniques are usually needed to transfer GCM-derived climate outputs into station-based values. In this study, a statistical downscaling model is investigated and its applicability in generating <b>daily</b> precipitation <b>series</b> is tested in the subtropical region of South China, which has not been investigated before. The model includes the first-order Markov chain for modeling wet day probability, Gamma distribution function for describing variation of wet-day precipitation amounts, and a statistical downscaling approach to transferring large-scale (in both space and time) future precipitation series from GCM climate change scenarios to station or local scales. A set of observed <b>daily</b> precipitation <b>series</b> of 32 years from 17 rainfall stations in and around a grid of 2. 5 &deg; in latitude by 3. 75 &deg; in longitude in Guangdong province of China is used to evaluate the model accuracy and validate the downscaling results. The downscaled <b>daily</b> precipitation <b>series</b> and the extreme precipitation features (including maximum, maximum 3 -day average and maximum 7 -day average) are compared with the observed values. The results show that the proposed model is capable of reproducing the mean daily amount and model parameters of the <b>daily</b> precipitation <b>series</b> at station or local scales in the study region...|$|R

40|$|A {{timely and}} {{accurate}} understanding of land cover change has great significance in management of area resources. To explore {{the application of}} a daily normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) time series in land cover classification, the present study used HJ- 1 data to derive a <b>daily</b> NDVI time <b>series</b> by pretreatment. Different classifiers were then applied to classify the <b>daily</b> NDVI time <b>series.</b> Finally, the <b>daily</b> NDVI time <b>series</b> were classified based on multiclassifier combination. The results indicate that support vector machine (SVM), spectral angle mapper, and classification and regression tree classifiers can be used to classify <b>daily</b> NDVI time <b>series,</b> with SVM providing the optimal classification. The classifiers of K-means and Mahalanobis distance are not suited for classification because of their classification accuracy and mechanism, respectively. This study proposes a method of dimensionality reduction based on the statistical features of <b>daily</b> NDVI time <b>series</b> for classification. The method can be applied to land resource information extraction. In addition, an improved multiclassifier combination is proposed. The classification results indicate that the improved multiclassifier combination is superior to different single classifier combinations, particularly regarding subclassifiers with greater differences...|$|R
