As on Turkey, drought conditions have dominated on the region after the year 1994. These changes have been occurred by constantly deaths in community of black pines on the south-facing slope (between the years 2000 - 2009). Increasing temperature and evaporation, decreasing relative humidity and rainfall-runoff is clearly for the region. In addition, there were not air pollution and infected primer insect-fungus damage. This also strengthens the impact of drought. Identified areas of tree deaths in recent years are generally near the inner regions (the steppe areas).

40|$|<b>Insect</b> <b>fungus</b> gardens {{consist of}} a {{community}} of interacting microorganisms that can have either beneficial or detrimental effects to the farmers. In contrast to fungus-farming ants and termites, the fungal communities of ambrosia beetles {{and the effects of}} particular fungal species on the farmers are largely unknown. Here, we used a laboratory rearing technique for studying the filamentous fungal garden community of the ambrosia beetle, Xyleborinus saxesenii, which cultivates fungi in tunnels excavated within dead trees. Raffaelea sulfurea and Fusicolla acetilerea were transmitted in spore-carrying organs by gallery founding females and established first in new gardens. Raffaelea sulfurea had positive effects on egg-laying and larval numbers. Over time, four other fungal species emerged in the gardens. Prevalence of one of them, Paecilomyces variotii, correlated negatively with larval numbers and can be harmful to adults by forming biofilms on their bodies. It also comprised the main portion of garden material removed from galleries by adults. Our data suggest that two mutualistic, several commensalistic and one to two pathogenic filamentous fungi are associated with X. saxesenii. Fungal diversity in gardens of ambrosia beetles appears to be much lower than that in gardens of fungus-culturing ants, which seems to result from essential differences in substrates and behaviour...|$|E

40|$|Entomopathogenic fungi {{can produce}} a series of {{chitinase}}s, some of which act synergistically with proteases to degrade insect cuticle. However, chitinase involvement in <b>insect</b> <b>fungus</b> pathogenesis has not been fully characterized. In this paper, an endochitinase, Bbchit 1, was purified to homogeneity from liquid cultures of Beauveria bassiana grown in a medium containing colloidal chitin. Bbchit 1 had a molecular mass of about 33 kDa and pI of 5. 4. Based on the N-terminal amino acid sequence, the chitinase gene, Bbchit 1, and its upstream regulatory sequence were cloned. Bbchit 1 was intronless, {{and there was a}} single copy in B. bassiana. Its regulatory sequence contained putative CreA/Crel carbon catabolic repressor binding domains, which was consistent with glucose suppression of Bbchit 1. At the amino acid level, Bbchit 1 showed significant similarity to a Streptomyces avermitilis putative endochitinase, a Streptomyces coelicolor putative chitinase, and Trichoderma harzianum endochitinase Chit 36 Y. However, Bbchit 1 had very low levels of identity to other chitinase genes previously isolated from entomopathogenic fungi, indicating that Bbchit 1 was a novel chitinase gene from an insect-pathogenic fungus. A gpd-Bbchit 1 construct, in which Bbchit 1 was driven by the Aspergiullus nidulans constitutive promoter, was transformed into the genome of B. bassiana, and three transformants that overproduced Bbchit 1 were obtained. Insect bioassays revealed that overproduction of Bbchit 1 enhanced the virulence of B. bassiana for aphids, as indicated by significantly lower 50 % lethal concentrations and 50 % lethal times of the transformants compared to the values for the wild-type strain...|$|E
40|$|Insect-induced galls are the {{deformation}} of plants initiated by insects which provide the immature insects shelters to acquire nutrition and protection to grow up. In some cases, gall inducing-insects develop intimate relationship with fungi and {{feed on the}} fungi rather than gall tissue. These galls are called ambrosia galls. The galling <b>insect,</b> <b>fungus</b> and host plant form a tritrophic interaction. This study will discuss how the fungi invade the cells, what the fungi are, and what the energy used in ambrosia galls. In Taiwan, some Daphnephila midge galls on Machilus spp. {{were found to be}} ambrosia galls recently. In this study, all of sixteen morphological species of Daphnephila spp. develop with mycelium in larvae cavities. Daphnephila is a diverse group in Taiwan and there are only five species named, each formed distinct galls on M. thunbergii. Culture and diagnosis of these fungi from the five different galls has found that they all have the fungus species Botryosphaeria dothidea (Ascomycota: Dothideomycetes: Botryophaeriaceae) identified by ITS sequences, which has been reported in other midge system as the fungus associate with ambrosia galls. Further survey of the fungal flora of other Daphnephila gall chambers discovered eleven different genera of fungi. The result suggests that Daphnephila may not be specific to certain fungal species. The tissue differentiation and levels of invasion by hyphae in ten galls were examined by paraffin sectioning. The ambrosia galls caused by Daphnephila are highly differentiated contrasted to the normal leaf tissue. Six layers of structure could be identified from outer-to-inner gall tissues, i. e., (i) the epidermis, (ii) cortex, (iii) vascular bundle, (iv) parenchyma between vascular bundle and sclerenchyma, (v) sclerechyma, (vi) nutritive tissue, including parenchyma in nutritive tissue and fungi zone. Variation from the above typical differentiation may be found in the banana-shaped galls on M. thunbergii which does not have the outer parenchyma zone and the inner parenchyma cells zone of the nutrition zone. All of the hyphae do not invade beyond the vascular bundles, and the nutrition layer (parenchyma cells) or sclerenchyma zone only accompanies intercellularly with the mycelium. As the nutrition hypothesis is the most plausible one depicted the adaptive significances of gall evolution, analysis of the energy among different types of galls with calorie test may help to understand whether there is a concordant pattern of evolution in their energy use. The result indicates a general pattern that galls of derived groups, contains higher energy based on the phylogeny of three main clades reported earlier. In dissection and observation of female abdominal segments, mycangia, a specific structure carrying spores, is on a distinct area in the eighth abdominal segment. Mycangia is covered by seventh enlarged segment with setae, and may have the function of carrying spores. It is also supposed to be a potential synapomorphy in Asphondyliini. Although the direct evidences of spore transmission were not clarified, my analyses provide information on the fungal association of the Daphnephila ambroia galls from various aspects which will be helpful for future study. 蟲癭是經由造癭昆蟲將植物變形轉化而來，提供造癭昆蟲避難所並供給造癭昆蟲所需的保護及生長的地方。在一些例子中，真菌會參與其中的發育生長，而造癭昆蟲轉而以真菌為食，取代蟲癭的營養組織，這一類具有真菌的蟲癭稱為營養癭 (ambrosia galls) ，其中造癭昆蟲、真菌及寄主植物三者形成三個不同營養層次的交互作用。本研究擬探討造癭昆蟲在營養癭中利用何種真菌及真菌侵入蟲癭細胞的程度與能量利用的高低為何。近來發現在台灣部分楨楠屬植物上由癭蚋科Daphnephila屬昆蟲所形成的蟲癭即為營養癭。本次取樣分析的 16 種Daphnephila蟲癭中，蟲室內都含有真菌，伴隨造癭昆蟲的幼蟲生長。紅楠上有五種已命名的Daphnephila癭蚋，其形態各異，其內的真菌類群經由ITS段基因分析為Botryosphaeria dothidea (Ascomycota: Dothideomycetes: Botryophaeriaceae) 。早期研究指出B. dothidea在其他癭蚋科昆蟲及營養癭中關係密切。本研究進一步調查中顯示，其他種的楨楠屬寄主植物之Daphnephila蟲癭和真菌的關係並未呈現專一的現象，共有十一屬的真菌出現在不同的癭室中。經由石蠟切片予以觀察 10 種營養癭中的細胞分化及菌絲侵入的程度。相對於正常的葉片組織，由Daphnephila屬所形成的營養癭以高度的組織及結構分化為主要的特徵。以紅楠鼠狀蟲癭為例，由外而內分為六個不同程度的組織分化（i）表皮層、（ii）皮層、（iii）維管束層、（iv）於厚壁細胞層和維管束層為界的一至二層的薄壁細胞、（v）厚壁組織層（vi）營養組織層；營養組織層又可細分成兩層，位於營養組織層內的薄壁細胞層與真菌層。相對於上述的典型分化之外，紅楠上的棒狀蟲癭的組織分化相對簡單，不包含於厚壁細胞層和維管束層為界的薄壁細胞層與營養組織層內的薄壁細胞層共五層的細胞分化。菌絲侵入蟲癭組織之程度方面，發現全部的菌絲都沒有侵入到維管束層，且在營養層或厚壁細胞層中，菌絲是沿著薄壁細胞的細胞間深入蟲癭組織。營養假說是解釋蟲癭適應最被廣為接受的其中一個假說，不同程度的營養利用或許可以反映出不同程度上的演進。本研究針對不同的形態的蟲癭進行卡洛里能量分析，探討其演化的模式與能量的利用是否一致。對照Daphnephila屬在系統發生的三個主要不同支序，大體上顯示較原始的類群含有較低能量，而衍生的物種能量較高，演化趨勢似朝較有效率的營養利用。解剖並觀察雌蟲腹部，雌蟲具有明顯的空腔的結構，可能即為所謂的攜菌器(mycangia) ，位於第八節腹板上，且由第七節延伸的腹板覆蓋，披覆著剛毛，或許扮演著攜帶孢子的功能。同時在Asphodyliini中，此攜菌器也可能擁有共同衍徵的潛在性。儘管本研究沒有直接的證據顯示出造癭昆蟲及真菌孢子的傳遞機制，不過在真菌及Daphnephila的營養癭的未來相關研究上可以提供有用的基礎資訊。TABLE OF CONTENT ABSTRACT (Chinese) 	i ABSTRACT (English) 	iii TABLE OF CONTENT	v LIST OF TABLES	vi LIST OF FIGURES	vii INTRODUCTION	 1 HISTORICAL REVIEW	 3 Insect gall	 3 Types of gall	 3 Ambrosia gall	 6 Asphondyliidi and Lasiopterini female behavior	 10 Biology of gall midges	 12 Galling insects and their host plants	 14 Background of Daphnaphila spp. 	 17 Cecidology in Taiwan	 17 MATERIALS AND METHODS	 19 Materials	 19 Methods	 19 I.
