5|$|Paiutes {{were the}} primary {{inhabitants}} of the Yosemite area and the foothills to the east during the Mariposa and historic phases.

5|$|At {{the same}} time, streams flowed from {{highlands}} in central Arizona north and across what is today the western Grand Canyon, possibly feeding a larger river. The {{mechanism by which}} the ancestral Lower Colorado River captured this drainage and the drainage from {{much of the rest}} of the Colorado Plateau is not known. Possible explanations include headward erosion or a broken natural dam of a lake or river. Whatever the cause, the Lower Colorado probably captured the landlocked Upper Colorado somewhere west of the Kaibab Uplift. The much larger <b>drainage</b> <b>area</b> and yet steeper stream gradient helped to further accelerate downcutting.|$|E
5|$|Subsequent {{analyses}} {{called the}} original landing zone estimate into question: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly farther east than initially assumed. Additional {{data from a}} variety of sources—in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction factored into drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees. This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the <b>drainage</b> <b>area</b> of the Washougal River.|$|E

5|$|The Upper Klamath Basin, {{defined by}} the <b>drainage</b> <b>area</b> of the Klamath River above Iron Gate Dam, is a unique {{transitional}} area between the Cascade Range {{to the west and}} the Basin and Range Province of the northern Great Basin to the southeast. This region extends from the southern Lower Klamath Lake area into the Lost River and Upper Klamath Lake basins. Crustal stretching and block faulting created a topography with characteristics similar to both regions. Almost the entire basin is a graben region, bearing basin and range characteristics, formed by uplifting and subsidence along several north–south faults.|$|E

40|$|The {{amount and}} {{composition}} of suspended load from 19 stations in Swiss rivers werestudied. Generally, {{the correlation between the}} amount of suspended load and of water discharge is good, although measurements over short periods of time show large fluctuations. The denudation rate was calculated from the suspended load discharge, the amount of elements in Solution, and the water discharge. Values of about 0. 05 mm/yr were obtained for <b>drainage</b> <b>areas</b> consisting mainly of crystalline rocks and about 0. 25 mm/yr for <b>drainage</b> <b>areas</b> dominated by sedimentary rocks. The mineralogical composition of the suspended load determined by X-ray diffraction can be correlated with the rock types in the <b>drainage</b> <b>areas.</b> Composition changes resulting from transportation were not observed. The clay fraction is mainly composed of illite and chlorite which was, for the most part, formed during mechanical weathering in the Alps. </i...|$|R

25|$|Belt press filters have 4 main zones: {{preconditioning}} zone, {{gravity drainage}} zone, linear compression (low-pressure) zone and roller compression (high-pressure) zone. Preconditioned slurry, which is flocculated and/or coagulated {{depending on the}} feed and process, is thickened in the gravity drainage zone. The gravity drainage zone is a flat or inclined belt where gravity drainage of free water occurs The gravity <b>drainage</b> <b>area</b> is sized according to feed solid concentrations. The standard size {{can be used for}} solids concentrations of 1.5 percent or greater, but a setup with a longer <b>drainage</b> <b>area</b> or extended size should be used for 1.5 to 2.5 percent feed solids for more free water drainage before compression. For dilute sludge with feed solids of less than 1.5 percent, an independent gravity drainage belt can be used. This belt is used only in the gravity <b>drainage</b> <b>area,</b> not in the pressure zones. The pressure or wedge zones use two belts, upper and lower, to sandwich the feed together, but an independent gravity zone has its own separate belt, making the belt filter a three-belt system. Depending on the required conditions of the cake, belt filters can have added washing stages and, infrared, hot gas or even microwave drying stages.|$|E
