5000|$|Worm drives {{have been}} used in a few {{automotive}} rear-axle final drives (though not the differential itself). They took advantage of the location of the gear being at either the very top or very bottom of the <b>differential</b> <b>crown</b> <b>wheel.</b> In the 1910s they were common on trucks; to gain the most clearance on muddy roads the worm gear was placed on top. In the 1920s the Stutz firm used them on its cars; to have a lower floor than its competitors, the gear was located on the bottom. An example from around 1960 was the Peugeot 404. The worm gear carries the differential gearing, which protects the vehicle against rollback. This ability has largely fallen from favour due to the higher-than-necessary reduction ratios.|$|E
50|$|The sport {{differential}} operates {{by using}} two superposition ("step up") gears at the differential, which are operated via multi-plate clutches {{each side of}} the <b>differential</b> <b>crown</b> <b>wheel.</b> When required by the software (using lateral and longitudinal yaw sensors, the ABS wheel sensors, and a steering wheel sensor), the control software (located in a control unit close to the rear differential), actuates the relevant clutch pack. This has the effect of taking the output shaft drive through the step-up gear to the attached wheel, while the other shaft continues to drive its wheel directly (i.e., the clutch pack not actuated). The higher speed output shaft produces increased torque to the wheel, producing a yaw (turning) moment. In normal operation increased torque is delivered to the wheel {{on the outside of the}} turn thereby increasing the vehicles turning moment, in other words, its willingness to turn in the direction pointed by the steering wheel.|$|E
40|$|Scania has {{experienced}} difficulties with large {{variations of the}} slope of the back plane after press quenching of case hardened <b>crown</b> <b>wheels</b> of especially type R 780 Steg supplied from ingot cast material. This leads to {{that a large number of}} <b>crown</b> <b>wheels</b> has to be remeasured and sorted according to back slope which is time consuming for operators. Also, after sorting of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheels,</b> hard machining has to be adjusted according to the different slopes of the back plane of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheels.</b> In some cases, it also leads to scrapping of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheels.</b> This master’s thesis was divided in two parts. The aim of the first part was to confirm that the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> type and casting technique that exhibits the largest variations in slope of the back plane is the R 780 Steg originating from ingot cast material. The <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> types that were compared were the R 780 Steg, R 780 Slät and R 885 Slät. <b>Crown</b> <b>wheels</b> manufactured from ingot cast material and from continuous cast material were compared. Hence, 6 combinations were examined. The slope of the back plane was measured with the measuring probe FARO after press quenching. The slope of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheels</b> was found to depend on both casting technique and the geometry of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel.</b> The results confirmed that the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> type and supplier combination that by far yields the largest variations in slope of the back plane is the R 780 Steg supplied by Steel Plant A who uses the ingot casting technique. For this combination the variation exceeds 0, 1 mm. All other combinations of <b>crown</b> <b>wheels</b> and suppliers yield acceptable variations. The second part of this master’s thesis was composed of determining if segregations in the cast ingot are the cause of the variations in slope of the back plane of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> type R 780 Steg. This was done by measuring if there is a correlation between {{the slope of the}} back plane of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> after press quenching, the chemical composition and the original position of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> in the ingot. As in the first part of the study, the distortion was measured by the measuring probe FARO. The samples were sent to Degerfors Laboratorium for chemical analysis. Analyses of C, S and N were made by using combustion analyses. For As, P, B and Al optic spectrometry (spark) was used. All other elements were analysed by x-ray fluorescence. Segregations were found to be present and in combination with the geometry of R 780 Steg to be the cause of the large variations in slope of the <b>crown</b> <b>wheels.</b> The results of this thesis show that, for the <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> type R 780 Steg, Scania should not use suppliers that employ the ingot casting technique. Instead, only suppliers using the continuous casting technique should be used. However, for the other <b>crown</b> <b>wheel</b> types ingot or continuously cast material can be used...|$|R
