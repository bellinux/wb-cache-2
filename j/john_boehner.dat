5|$|New York's 20th congressional {{district}} {{has historically been}} conservative, and early polls favored Tedisco, but by February 2009 the race was considered a toss-up. The Republican Party considered the election to be a referendum on President Obama's economic policy and as such, injected significant funding into Tedisco's campaign, using well-known Republicans such as former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich, Congressional Minority Leader <b>John</b> <b>Boehner,</b> and former New York Governor George Pataki for support. Democrats used Senator Gillibrand, Vice President Joe Biden, and an endorsement from President Barack Obama to support the Murphy campaign.|$|E
5|$|Before the 2006 election, Hastert {{expressed}} his intent to seek reelection as Speaker if the Republicans maintained {{control of the}} House. Hastert was reelected for an eleventh term to his seat in the House with nearly 60 percent of the vote, but that year the Republicans lost control of both the Senate and the House to the Democrats following a wave of voter discontent with the Iraq War, the Federal response to Hurricane Katrina, {{and a series of}} scandals among congressional Republicans. The day after the November election, Hastert announced he would not seek to become minority leader when the 110th Congress convened in January 2007. Later that month, <b>John</b> <b>Boehner</b> of Ohio defeated Mike Pence of Indiana in a 168-27 vote of the House Republican Conference election to become minority leader for the 110th Congress. The House Democratic Caucus unanimously selected House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to be Speaker (succeeding Hastert) for the 110th Congress.|$|E
5|$|<b>John</b> <b>Boehner,</b> {{a member}} of the Republican Party from Ohio, served as the Majority Leader of the United States House of Representatives from February 2006 until January 2007. As the Democratic Party assumed control of the House {{following}} the 2006 elections, Boehner served as Minority Leader from January 2007 until January 2011. When Republicans reassumed control of the House of Representatives in January 2011, Boehner was elected as Speaker, with the votes of all 241 of his fellow Republicans. In 2014, some House Republicans reached out to Ben Carson about his interest in becoming Speaker should they be able to oust Boehner; Carson declined, citing his impending candidacy for president. Boehner's Republican opponents formed a congressional caucus, called the Freedom Caucus, in January 2015 to focus their opposition. Though Boehner was reelected as Speaker {{at the beginning of the}} 114th United States Congress that month, 25 conservative members of the Republican caucus did not vote for him. Daniel Webster, a Republican from Florida, received 12 votes.|$|E

5|$|C-SPAN {{continues}} to expand its coverage of government proceedings, {{with a history of}} requests to government officials for greater access, especially to the U.S. Supreme Court. In December 2009, Lamb wrote to leaders in the House and Senate, requesting that negotiations for health care reform be televised by C-SPAN. Committee meetings on health care were broadcast subsequently by C-SPAN and may be viewed on the C-SPAN website. In November 2010, Lamb wrote to incoming House Speaker <b>John</b> <b>Boehner</b> requesting changes to restrictions on cameras in the House. In particular, C-SPAN asked to add some of its own robotically operated cameras to the existing government-controlled cameras in the House chamber. In February 2011, Boehner denied the request. A previous request to Speaker Designate Nancy Pelosi in 2006, to add C-SPAN's cameras in the House chamber to record floor proceedings, was also denied. Although C-SPAN uses the congressional chamber feed cables, the cameras are owned and controlled by each respective body of Congress. Requests by C-SPAN for camera access to non-government events such as the annual dinner by the Gridiron Club have also been denied.|$|E
5|$|Within {{months of}} {{arriving}} in Washington, D.C., Fletcher {{was selected as}} the leadership liaison for the 17-member freshman class of Republican legislators. He was appointed to the Committee on Education and Workforce, and <b>John</b> <b>Boehner,</b> chair of the committee's employer/employee relations subcommittee, chose Fletcher as his vice-chair. The committee's purpose is to oversee the rules for employer-paid health plans, among other issues, and although it is rare for a freshman legislator to attain a committee leadership post, Boehner cited Fletcher's experience in the medical field and work on reforming the Kentucky health care system as reasons for the appointment. Fletcher also served {{as a member of the}} House Committees on the Budget and Agriculture. In June 1999, he sponsored an amendment to a youth violence bill that allowed school districts to use federal funds to develop curricula which included elements designed to promote and enhance students' moral character; the amendment passed 422—1. Later, Fletcher was assigned to the Committee on Energy and Commerce and was selected as chairman of the Policy Subcommittee on Health.|$|E

Though Brat supported Boehner earlier, he reversed his support after the House GOP leadership did not allow him to make an amendment to block a controversial executive order signed by President Barack Obama in a spending bill.|$|R
50|$|Jordan was {{a critic}} of Speaker <b>John</b> <b>Boehner's</b> plan to raise the debt ceiling. In 2010, he was chair of the Republican Study Committee, and during the U.S. {{government}} shutdown of 2013, he was still considered its most powerful member.

5000|$|In August 2011 {{during the}} 2011 United States debt ceiling crisis, Gowdy opposed Speaker <b>John</b> <b>Boehner’s</b> debt limit bill, and {{he voted against}} the final debt ceiling agreement.

In December 2010, he told Congressional Quarterly that he would support a measure only if its sponsor could demonstrate that the Constitution gave the government the power to act in a particular realm.|$|R
25|$|Great {{divisions}} in the House GOP conference were apparent after the 2014 midterm elections, with conservative members, many {{of them from the}} right-leaning Freedom Caucus, expressing dissatisfaction with congressional leadership. <b>John</b> <b>Boehner's</b> surprise announcement in September 2015 that he would step down as Speaker sent shockwaves through the House. After Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy bowed out of the race to replace Boehner {{due to a lack of}} support, House Ways and Means Chair Paul Ryan announced he would run, with the Freedom Caucus' support. Ryan was elected Speaker on October 29.|$|R

50|$|On {{the evening}} of July 31, 2011, Obama {{announced}} that the leaders of both parties in both chambers had reached an agreement that would reduce the deficit and avoid default. The same day, Speaker of the House <b>John</b> <b>Boehner's</b> office outlined the agreement for House Republicans. One key element in the deal being reached and the logjam being broken earlier that afternoon was U.S. Vice President Joe Biden's ability to negotiate with his 25-year Senate colleague, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. Biden had spent the most time bargaining with Congress on the debt question of anyone in the administration, and McConnell had viewed him as the one most trustworthy.|$|R
40|$|The U. S. {{government}} {{was set up}} with a {{system of checks and}} balances that would ensure that no one part of government would have an excessive amount of power. In light of the current government shutdown, Ethan Ilzetzki argues that there is no constitutional impediment to the U. S. Congress passing a budget, only the refusal of Republican House Speaker <b>John</b> <b>Boehner’s</b> to allow a clean Continuing Resolution to go to a vote, which a majority of the house would be likely to support. Boehner’s reticence is almost entirely down to the influence of a minority of Republicans from the Tea Party- the type of factional influence that the founding fathers were greatly concerned about...|$|R
5000|$|On January 6, 2015, Babin was one {{of twenty-five}} House Republicans to vote against <b>John</b> <b>Boehner's</b> {{re-election}} as Speaker of the United States House of Representatives. Boehner, who needed at least 205 votes, was re-elected with 216 votes. 24 Republicans voted for another candidate and Babin voted [...] "present", effectively abstaining from the vote. Two days later, Babin explained his vote. He said that he didn't {{want to vote for}} Boehner, to reflect dissatisfaction with the Speaker in his district, particularly over the Cromnibus. However, he declined to vote for another candidate because [...] "he would have preferred to see Boehner denied reelection on the first ballot, forcing a closed-door GOP caucus meeting at which a replacement might emerge." ...|$|R
25|$|In June 2013, the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives {{passed the}} Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act.

[...] The bill [...] "requires the President to submit a status report to Congress every 30 days detailing the success of the recent 21,500 troop increase {{and the extent to which}} the Iraqi government is cooperating with the US stability efforts.

5000|$|In August and September 2013, Heritage Action, Tea Party Patriots, ForAmerica, {{and five}} other Tea Party groups {{embarked}} on nationwide tours to pressure Republican members of Congress to join the effort to defund the Affordable Care Act.
