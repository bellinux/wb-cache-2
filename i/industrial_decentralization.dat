Normand Cinq-MarsThe {{structure of}} collective bargaining both in Canada and in Quebec exhibit two major characteristics : {{a high degree}} of decentralization and a limitation in terms of the proportion of workers covered. The former results in the following effects (1) the local level bargaining practically excludes discussion of technological change, planning and standardization of fringe benefits ; (2) involves a conflict between this high degree of <b>industrial</b> relations <b>decentralization</b> and the increased concentration of decision making within the firm ; (3) creates difficulties in extending the collective agreement because of plant unit certification ; (4) promotes whip-sawing strikes. It is thus necessary to devise a new bargaining structure so that the contents of collective agreements can be rationally planned. Upward movement of the power center would also permit the bargaining locus to adjust to a similar on-going transformations within the business enterprise.. Encouragement of this trend does not mean strict « industry wide » bargaining since in some areas of Quebec the socio-economic realities do not call for such a system. A comprehensive approach to modernizing the collective bargaining structure would need to consider the factor and product markets, the subject matter to be negotiated, the desire of the workers, government policy and the relative bargaining power of the parties. The type of negotiating unit should also vary with industry concentration ratios, and indeed the rate of change in these ratios should condition the speed and direction of the transformation of existing bargaining units...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} argued {{that when the}} benefits of an infrastructure service are mostly local {{and there is little}} scope for economies of scale - as in urban transit, road maintenance, water supply, and solid waste management - decentralization is {{the most effective way to}} deliver service. Those services have been decentralized in many countries, and many others are rapidly decentralizing. The central government is still responsible for many other infrastructure services, such as power and telecommunications, but this too is changing as the responsibility is increasingly transferred to subnational governments. Recent technological innovations reduce the need for services to be provided by monopolistic utilities. Power generation and distribution can now be handled competitively by decentralized units, and parts of some local telephone monopolies will increasingly meet competition from wireless telephones and rival wireline systems. How has increased decentralization affected spending levels on infrastructure? The outcome reflects the net outcome of opposing effects. Spending increases if the subnational government makes infrastructure a higher priority than the federal government did, if they are less effective at delivering services, or if they give up the benefits of economies of scale to get more autonomy. Spending decreases if they assign infrastructure a lower priority, or if most projects are most cost-effective. In their analysis, the authors focus on spending levels and ignore the reasons these levels change, so no conclusions can be made about whether decentralization makes spending more of less efficient. Among the conclusions they offer the following. First, decentralization tends to increase both total and subnational spending on infrastructure - possibly because the preferences of subnational governments in terms of quality and quantity of infrastructure are different from the central government's preferences. Second, the conventional wisdom is true: for decentralization, policymakers everywhere must guarantee a balance between revenue and spending assignment. A good way to offset the impact of decentralization on spending levels is to increase the imbalance between revenue and spending assignments. Third, be careful about applying lessons learned in <b>industrial</b> countries to <b>decentralization</b> in developing countries. What happens in industrial countries may help assess the decentralization's impact on total spending in developing countries, because the elasticity of per capita infrastructure spending is roughly similar in both countries. But that is not a good indicator for subnational spending, for which the elasticity is greater than 1 in developing countries and less than 1 in industrial countries.

It is proposed an indicator, which uses worker’s wage and educational data, as well as the share of scientific and technical labor, so that the industry located in the different regions could be compared. As expected, the workers in the new industrial areas receive lower wages and have less years of education.

40|$|Even if {{the level}} of {{urbanization}} in Ethiopia is low by African standard, the rates of urbanization in Ethiopia are exceptional. Until 1985 the growth rate {{was more or less}} the same as the whole Africa. But in the last two decades, despite the rural bias policy, the growth rate was very fast in Ethiopia (4, 3 %), while the rate largely decline in other African countries, 3, 3 %. Rapid urbanization caused by internal migration is a source of high costs of food, housing, transport, health and other basic services in towns. Not only that there is a speedy urbanization in Ethiopia, its regional distribution is unbalanced: urbanization in Ethiopia is uneven and there is unbalanced growth of towns. The level of urbanization varies regionally, ranging from nearly 100 per cent in Addis Ababa to 8, 7 per cent in SNNPR. By default the regional pattern of urbanization in Ethiopia is already unbalanced. The urban structure has uneven character in size and amorphous in functions and it is therefore important to have an industrial policy which brings about balanced regional growth in the country. I advocated <b>industrial</b> <b>decentralization</b> (relocation of manufacturing industries to medium and small towns) to bring about balanced growth and absorb the rural surplus labor in its own proximate location (to curb long distance migration).

40|$|East London {{is a minor}} coastal {{city with}} a fragile economy based largely on the food, motor and textile {{manufacturing}} sectors. Between 1945 and 1960 {{the economy of the}} city grew rapidly registering annual growth rates in excess of 10 %. This growth was based on secondary industrialization in the manufacturing sector. However, since the inauguration of the homeland policy which wedged East London between two impoverished, self- governing homeland states, Transkei and Ciskei, the economy of the city has fared less well. Low annual growth rates were recorded throughout the 1970 s and 1980 s despite efforts by the Apartheid government to shore up the local economy by offering attractive <b>industrial</b> <b>decentralization</b> incentives in the region. The fragility of the city is not only based on its regional location, but on the absence of mineral and power sources and its distance from major metropolitan markets. Being situated in one of the poorest provinces in the country, East London's growth has always been limited by a weak local consumer market (Swilling 1987 : 140). While the economic prospects for the city have recently improved with the dismantling of the homeland system and the centralization of the Eastern Cape's regional government in nearby capital of Bisho (30 minutes’ drive from East London), the city is still badly in need of major economic investment to cater for its rapidly growing population. During the past decade, there has been a massive transfer of population from rural to urban areas in the Eastern Cape generally. This occurred {{as a result of a}} softening of homeland borders in the mid- 1980 s, the removal of the influx control laws in 1986, as well as the deterioration of agricultural prospects in a region gripped by a crippling drought throughout the 1980 s. These factors have ensured that East London became the tar-get of a sustained wave of rural-urban immigration. Dozens of new informal settlements have sprung up all over the city during the past five years, while the established townships within the city limits have become hopelessly overcrowded. The research for this project was conducted in East London's most congested township, Duncan Village. In 1995, it had a population of approximately 100 000 people.

40|$|Republic of Kazakhstan {{representing}} an exponent of {{the five}} Central Asian states is a country where sweeping structural reforms proceed in socio-economic sphere towards a capitalist economic system. In the beginning stage of transition, Kazakhstan nevertheless was a follower of some FSU countries including Russia and the Kyrgyz republic due to hesitation in implementing several important measures. However, after the Kazakhstani government and IMF came to an agreement on macro stabilizing policy package {{in the end of}} 1993, the country had rapidly accelerated deregulation of economic activity and privatization of state-owned firms. By virtue of great efforts made under the authoritarian leadership of President Nazarbayev during 1994 - 98, Kazakhstan now bears comparison with other reforming countries with regards to the degree of decentralization of economic system. It is obvious that deregulation of price, trade and foreign exchange is a necessary, but not a sufficient requirement for crafting a market-oriented society. As I stressed in the preceding paper upon Kyrgyzstan (see Slavic Studies, No. 47, pp. 37 - 69), so as to activate decentralized economic system, a competitive industrial organization has to be combined with freed economic circumstances. In addition, mutual relations between the government and business entities ought to be coordinated to complement this institutional coordination simultaneously. This is a rudimental analytical view of the author. It is no doubt that there is a virtual unanimity for the proposition that the privatization of state property gives a momentum for generating significant changes in industrial organization, corporate governance and government-business relationship of the post-socialist countries. Therefore, the article attempts to view these three aspects seriatim with tracing privatization policy and its main consequences in Kazakhstan in order to examine whether or not this country has establish desirable economic structure. In this paper, the achievements of Kazakhstani government in the field of the legislation of new laws concerning enterprise activities and the deregulation policy are briefly mentioned in section 1. The second section describes a basic framework of the privatization of stateowned firms and its outcomes in 1992 - 98. The organization form of newborn institutional investors including state holding companies and investment privatization funds (IPFs), and their impacts on diversification of industrial organization and corporate governance are elaborated in section 3. Restructuring process of the government-business relationship is treated in section 4. And in section 5, by utilizing microdata of 768 industrial firms, the author conducts an empirical analysis in order to compare their actual behaviors with the main presumptions to which foregoing three sections reach. The article draws the following conclusion: The three-stage privatization implemented during six years after collapse of Soviet Union could dramatically change the ownership structure of industrial sector for the benefit of private investors and entrepreneurs. IPFs and other private investment companies as well as foreign capitals became major stockholders and/or managers of many privatized firms. It is noteworthy that some of them have laid the foundation of so-called industrial-financial groups, which began to make inroads into so far impregnable monopoly markets dominated by sectional state holding companies. Thereupon, the significant diversification of industrial organization and corporate governance was incarnated and to some extent the intensification of managerial discretion has also proceeded. Notwithstanding such positive achievements in the industry, new mechanisms of governance did not work out due to some unsolved problems including increasing inter-enterprise arrears and underdevelopment of financial sector, both of which are vital for new institutional investors. As a consequence, the government remains most important stakeholder for even privatized firms and retains great influence in <b>industrial</b> <b>decentralization.</b> Hence a reorganization of the government-business relations is recognized as a key element to predict whether Kazakhstan will promote indispensable conditions for competition in industry further. Indeed, in this connection the central government actually has taken some drastic measures to restructure its management system to adjust systemic transformation process. By way of illustration, the government executed extensive integration of its organs and introduced strict regulation regime against an arbitrary intervention by state agencies and officials into private business activities and so forth. However, the effort for creating more neutralized relationship between the state and business is seriously spoiled by an informal mechanism institutionalized on the top level of the state. The most powerful seven business groups virtually represent most of gigantic enterprises in Kazakhstan and enjoy exclusive apportioning of economic interests by occupying primary positions in the cabinet of ministers and government offices. The scale of their political activities is difficult to gauge. Albeit this fact, it is without doubt that they are so influential on decision-making process of the government that there is no warranty to secure a fair competition in this country even in case if privatization policy will make a significant progress from now on. Summarizing all aforementioned aspects, the author urges that the Kazakhstani government should make strenuous efforts to rectify the weakness of the institutional coordination for promoting a market economy now and otherwise in the near future, the country will lose its ascendancy of economic system over other Central Asian states. In a sense, Kazakhstan may have to negotiate more steep and dangerous path of systemic transformation than before...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{decades have}} {{witnessed}} a growing tide of migration of rural people to large urban centres. The flight {{from country to}} town has been both because of the lure of city life - employment, social amenities, and escape from traditional social restrictions - {{and because of the}} absence in rural areas of basic facilities such as roads, water and electricity, schools and health services. The fact that most migrants have failed to realize their dreams for a brighter future has not slowed the flow. People appear to prefer urban poverty to rural poverty, perhaps maintaining a fading hope that some day their chance will come. The fact that millions of people {{have come to believe that}} life in the villages offers no hope whatever is the clearest indication of the failure of rural development in recent years. Yet the opportunities exist for providing an alternative to emigration but they require a change in priorities. Policy makers are confronted with a choice of either encouraging the development of economic activity and supporting services in rural areas or of accepting the status quo and its inevitable consequence; a depopulated, ageing and predominantly female rural sector, agricultural production lagging ever further behind national needs, and ever swelling numbers of desperate urban poor. Towns and cities grow out of the countryside. The greatest cities of the world were once mere collections of a few dwellings. What enabled them to develop into larger communities was either commerce (trade) or industry, and originally industry and trade were based on the needs and production of agriculture. In the past change was slow because population growth was slow, and population movement was in response to urban demand for labour. Famine and military activities forced short term major population shifts to secure cities but the ample opportunity to achieve a degree of self-sufficiency in the rural areas usually drew people back to grow their own food and to benefit from living as extended families in small communities. For much of history there has been a symbiotic relationship between town and country, the former providing the centre of administration and defence in times of trouble, and acting as centres for learning, craftsmanship and trade while the rural hinterland has provided the food and raw materials for processing and trade. But, while history demonstrates that a balanced development of commerce and industry in rural centres can stimulate national development and prosperity, recent policies have diverted many countries from this path with disastrous social and economic consequences. Colonization by foreign powers required that administration, commerce and, more rarely industry, were centralized for easier control. Since the rural hinterland was invariably looked on as only a source of raw materials and labour it was left without investment or development. As examples, the copper mines of Zambia, the coal fields of Zimbabwe and the gold and diamond deposits of South Africa demanded for the most part very large work-forces. Since supervisors and management were colonists there was no perceived requirement to develop education in the rural areas from which this labour was drawn. Similarly, plantations drew labour from as far afield as, for example, to Côte d'lvoire, from Mali and Burkina Faso. And, since the administration adopted a laissez faire attitude to life in the villages, little was done initially to try and change traditional techniques of agriculture or to improve facilities. Belatedly some colonial powers instituted basic education and health in rural districts. However, the pattern of roads suited to central government, absence of rural electricity and other amenities, and lack of any alternative sources of employment other than subsistence agriculture or migrant labour, was inherited and perpetuated by national governments after Independence. Western Nigeria provides a typical example of how changes in attitude and priorities damaged and distorted development. Traditionally in Nigeria, as in many other countries, the market place was a focal point of economic life and around it developed a hierarchy of settlements ranging from small hamlets to large cities. However, the values implicit in these traditional settlement and market patterns in Nigeria seem to have been overlooked or ignored in post-independence developments such as the building of transport routes. Trunk and even feeder roads have often by-passed centres of production and trade with the result that produce has frequently failed to reach the more distant and larger market centres. Changing perceptions and priorities The International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI), which is based in Washington, organized a meeting of leading African anglophone and francophone policy-makers and researchers in Saly Portugal, Senegal in December 1994 as part of its 2020 Vision for Food, Agriculture and the Environment initiative. A synthesis of the views included the observation that, 'Most governments want to reduce poverty but many are doubtful that it can be done on a sustainable basis. This illustrates the importance of understanding both the sources of poverty in Africa and the links between economic growth and poverty alleviation. Since 90 % of Africa's poor live in rural areas, key poverty reduction strategies should aim at raising rural incomes. This necessarily involves measures to increase agricultural productivity which will directly increase rural incomes. Incomes will also increase indirectly through the creation of effective purchasing power in rural areas for services and local manufactured items, thus increasing off-farm employment. ' Until recently, the role of small towns and the need for off-farm employment as foci for rural change and transformation in Africa have generally been neglected by national governments and by the aid community and development organizations. Instead, integrated rural development programmes were adopted by many administrations and development agencies to the exclusion of the development of small urban centres, which were neglected and often dismissed as 'problem areas'. There has now been a gradual shift in the ways of thinking and as the IFPRI seminar revealed, there is growing acknowledgement of the interdependence and complementary roles of rural and urban sectors. The symbiotic relationship between country and town is being recognized and it can be seen that neither can survive let alone thrive without the other. Despite the lack of recognition given to them, traditional market centres can provide off-farm employment and a link between the production and consumption centres of the economies within which they are located. They also act as the centres of information for the surrounding areas and have various facilities such as health, credit and postal services. Suitable industries for off-farm employment Ideally industries for development in rural areas should utilize the raw materials available in the locality. Agroprocessing is an obvious choice since it not only utilizes farm produce but adds value. It also reduces the need for transport to more distant and centralized sites and therefore reduces costs; only the less bulky processed goods have need of transport out of the area while the by-products, such as cotton seed and palm kernel and grain polishings, remain in the rural areas where they are easily accessible for farmers wishing to purchase them for feeding to livestock. In large urban centres such materials are, more often than not, an inconvenient and potentially polluting biomass. Food processing lends itself to decentralization and small-scale development. On a small scale, it requires very little equipment and capital investment, and suitable technologies exist for small scale drying of fruits, nuts and vegetables oil extraction, baked goods and snack food production. Conversely there are technologies which are inappropriate for small-scale adoption; these include operations that require substantial capital outlay for equipment, for example the canning of fruit, making juices and bottling or dried milk production. If there is a local demand from consumers for a particular product, turnover is rapid and initial investments can be recouped quickly. Food processing adds value to raw products and prevents wastage by converting produce into less perishable forms. Because the consumption of food is a basic requirement of all people, rural and urban, and because families are increasingly seeking timesaving ways of preparing foods, food processing can be a very successful small enterprise. In contrast, the introduction of large-scale food processing factories can be detrimental to rural people. Because such factories are often highly automated, they employ few people and many of these are skilled technicians and supervisors trained in electronics and nutrition sciences. Many less educated yet enterprising and hard working people, particularly women heads of households, who are reliant on traditional food processing practices such as hand operated milling, grinding and oil extraction, are forced out of the market through competition. Yet if all the costs of establishing, running and maintaining modern factories were shown, including the social and environmental costs, the small-scale enterprises would often have a clear advantage. Large-scale food processing may also result in products that are nutritionally inferior to traditional products. For example, polished rice, white bread made from refined flour, and white sugar are all less nutritious than their traditional counterparts, hand-pounded rice, ground maize-meal and gun Some manufactured products may even be injurious to health: in Nigeria, for example, the manufacture of gari from cassava is now frequently mechanized. Because it contains cyanide, some varieties of fresh cassava traditionally undergo a laborious process to effect detoxification and render it safe for consumption. In terms of cyanide removal, the longer this process takes, the better is the end product. Mechanization has meant, that the traditional 4 - 6, day processes have been reduced to one : day with variable effects on product quality and nutritional value. One of the arguments used to support the development of large-scale food processing plants is that they will provide a guaranteed market for rural production that would otherwise go to waste. In practice these plants are often sited in cities which are either inaccessible because of lack of feeder roads, or incur an unacceptably high transport cost for rural people. Plant managers may also impose strict limitations on the quality and minimum quantity of raw material that will be accepted. These obstacles force many small producers out of the market and discourage potential newcomers. Ironically, the self-same inhibiting factors can lead to the demise of the large processing plants since they fail to operate at full capacity and therefore are unable to deliver the low cost of production that processing in large quantity should provide. In Zimbabwe decentralized production of edible oil from sunflower seed proved to be a successful initiative (See box). Since independence in 1980, the government of Zimbabwe has embarked on a national programme to restructure the economy. One of the major thrusts has been to develop the communal lands through the development of rural settlement infrastructure in district and rural service centres. The government believed that centres could provide a growth point. In the hierarchy of settlements, growth points lie between existing town and district service centres in terms of the facilities which are available. Some of the characteristics of a growth point include: · the existence of a proven economy, which through utilizing local raw materials is capable of sustainable growth; · a high potential for the development of substantial forward and backward linkages with the surrounding hinterlands through vertical and horizontal integration; · the ability to facilitate <b>industrial</b> <b>decentralization</b> by providing alternative but viable opportunities. These growth points are basically urban but some are in the hinterland. Some 20 growth points were identified but of these only four or five have demonstrated potential. The majority of the centres were selected because they were administrative centres but many proved to be little more than small towns that had grown up around administrative offices, police, army, courts and supermarkets with no real opportunities for small businesses. Similar development and planning policies have been implemented in Malawi and Tanzania. Jonathan Barker of the Scandinavian Institute of African Studies, Uppsala, Sweden, reported on the results of a SlDA-commissioned study of these towns in northern Tanzania which 'show that the most economically successful and secure households in surrounding villages are those which combine crop production and sales with a variety of non-farm and off-farm income-generating activities. 'Nor-farm' production refers to work which is carried out on the farm but which is not related to crop production; for example, making furniture and bricks for sale in both small town and village markets. 'Off-farm' refers to activities carried out elsewhere. These include employment in town and ownership of urban assets such as shops or rooms for renting. ' People and policy Government policy can encourage or inhibit individuals to greater or lesser endeavour and entrepreneurship. If there is to be growth of small businesses in rural areas crucial needs are ready access to finance and to an all-weather transport system. Both needs can be greatly assisted by central and regional governments. A good road network will itself encourage the development of small transport businesses but whether entrepreneurs turn to trucking, agroprocessing or the many associated activities that are needed by a prospering community (ranging from engineering repair shops, agricultural supplies merchants and fuel suppliers to tailors, clothes outfitters, food shops and restaurants) most will require finance to get started. Few rural people have the collateral necessary to secure standard bank borrowing and government guaranteeing of 'seed money' loans can result in substantial pay-back for relatively small initial investment. Once businesses are established and have accumulated financial resources, both as working capital and purchased plant, they can use these as security for any further loans from the official banking sector in order to expand further. Provided that potential borrowers have made clear to them the basis of 'start-up' loans and terms of repayment, and are guided to draw up an outline business plan to establish how the borrowing is to be serviced, funds will be repaid and the money will be available for further lending ' to others. Experience in Africa and Asia, has shown that provision of credit can, stimulate dramatic changes in the prosperity of people previously consider unbankable and destined for perpetual poverty. All this will require a major change in outlook at the most senior levels of government. Finding resources to fund development in rural areas at this time of financial constraint will be difficult but, as the participants of IFPRI's 2020 Vision for Food, Agriculture and the Environment in sub-Saharan African concluded on this issue: 'Although this need comes at a time of public retrenchment, it is a question of priorities. In most countries, the rate of national public investment in agriculture must be raised significantly. Given the size of the agricultural sector, its present and potential contributions to the economy, and its share in export earnings and fiscal revenues, as much as 30 - 40 % of national budget outlays should be invested in agriculture. This is a figure that far exceeds the historical average of 7 % of budgetary expenditure going to this sector. ' Some may say that governments have a choice but others might observe that in reality they have no choice. Recent decades have witnessed a growing tide of migration of rural people to large urban centres. The flight from country to town has been both because of the lure of city life - employment, social amenities, and escape from traditional social [...] ...|$|E
