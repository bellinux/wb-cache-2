40|$|Involucrin, {{a protein}} subunit of {{keratinocyte}} cross-linked envelopes, is a distinctive marker for suprabasal differentiation in stratified squamous epithelium. Immunoperoxidase staining for involucrin {{was used to}} evaluate paraffin sections of tissue obtained by colposcopically directed biopsies of infectious, metaplastic, and dysplastic lesions of the cervix and vagina. Areas of normal squamous epithelium, papillary and <b>flat</b> <b>condyloma</b> acuminatum, and mature and immature squamous metaplasia showed positive staining in 99 per cent of samples lacking significant inflammation and in 60 per cent of those with moderate or severe inflammation. In contrast, only 19 per cent of the squamous cell dysplasias, even those without much inflammation, showed positive staining, and no area with moderate or severe inflammation showed positive staining. These findings indicate that expression of involucrin is modulated by ceIIular pathologic features and microenvironment. We suggest that immunoperoxidase staining for involucrin may be useful in distinguishing mild dysplasia from immature metaplasia and <b>flat</b> <b>condyloma</b> in some biopsy specimens in which routine histologic examination yields an indeterminate diagnosis...|$|E
40|$|Although the {{diagnostic}} category of atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) {{has been known}} since 1988, its use and appropriate clinical follow up and management still remains controversial. This study was carried out to evaluate {{the diagnostic}} value of ASCUS, using cytohistologic correlation. A retrospective review of archival materials in our cytology laboratory files was performed for cervicovaginal smears diagnosed as ASCUS from March 1999 to February 2002. In 8551 cervicovaginal smears examined, ASCUS was reported in 236 (2. 76 %) cases, with histologic follow up in 98 (41. 2 %). During the follow up period of patients with ASCUS, 51 patients (52 %) had benign/reactive lesions, 43 patients (43. 9 %) were diagnosed as having a squamous intraepithelial lesion (SIL), 2 (2. 1 %) specimen were insufficient and finally two cases (2 %) proved to be invasive cervical carcinoma on histology. Of cases diagnosed as SIL, 22 (22. 4 %) were interpreted as <b>flat</b> <b>condyloma,</b> 9 (9. 1 %) cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) 1, 2 (2. 1 %) CIN 1 - 2, 3 (3. 1 %) high grade SIL, 6 (6. 1 %) basal cell abnormality of undetermined significance, and 1 (1 %) had features of CIN 1 in presence of severe inflammation. Patients whose smears fall {{into the category of}} ASCUS may exhibit a spectrum of findings, ranging from benign/reactive lesions to frequent SIL and rarely to invasive carcinoma. Therefore, patients with a diagnosis of ASCUS justify careful follow-up and investigation...|$|E

40|$|Three hundred thirty-seven female {{patients}} with the diagnosis of human papillomavirus (HPV) cervitis were reviewed during the last decade. The study {{was focused on the}} relationship between human papillomavirus cervitis, cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN), and the risk of developing cervical cancer, in situ or micro-invasive. The examined material was cervical curettages and segmental biopsies, and vaginal smears (Pap-test). The results of the research showed that the typical human papillomavirus cervitis represents the 49. 3 % of the above cases, while the rest 50. 7 %, represents human papillomavirus-like cervitis (cervitis with absence of one or more histological criteria of human papillomavirus infection). The mean age of the female {{patients with}} HPV infection was 35 years, ranged between the ages of 24 and 44 years. A 36. 5 % percentage of cervical intraepithelial involvement was found (CIN) in HPV cervitis. The mean age of the females with HPV cervitis without CIN cervical involvement was 45 years. The histological type of HPV cervitis is of great importance; 37. 1 % of <b>flat</b> <b>condylomas</b> complicated with CIN lesions and 1. 78 % developed cervical cancer, in situ, or micro-invasive. On the contrary, the infrequently found condylomas accuminata (8. 4 %), don't usually show CIN involvement of cervix or involution to cervical cancer (0 %). Finally, whenever CIN lesions developed in condylomata accuminata are observed, are few and mild (CIN I, 0. 6 %), compaired to those found in <b>flat</b> <b>condylomas</b> (CIN II, CIN III) ...|$|R
40|$|Human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) types 16 and 18 {{have been}} identified in two different human cervical carcinomas. The viral DNAs were molecularly cloned and used as probes to screen a large number of genital tumors by Southern blot analysis. HPV- 16 or HPV- 18 sequences, respectively, were found in a high percentage of cervical carcinomas, but only in a small number of condylomata acuminata or <b>flat</b> <b>condylomas.</b> The majority of the latter lesions, however, contained HPV- 6 or HPV- 11 sequences, respectively, which in contrast were detected only rarely in carcinomas in situ or invasively growing carcinomas. A similar distribution of the different papillomaviruses was observed when cell swabs taken from the cervix were tested by in situ hybridization...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} {{proposed}} that low-grade vulvar and vaginal lesions (VIN 1 and VaIN 1) are <b>flat</b> <b>condylomas</b> and should be designated as such. Moreover, their relationship to high-grade lesions (VIN 3 and VaIN 3) is unclear. Accordingly, this study was undertaken {{to address these issues}} by comparing the distribution of human papillomavirus (HPV) types in vulvar and vaginal intraepithelial lesions. We identified 33 cases of VIN 1, 34 cases of VIN 3, 17 cases of VaIN 1, and 16 cases of VaIN 3. In addition, 36 cases of low-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) in the cervix and 116 cases of cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion were used for comparison. Polymerase chain reaction analysis was performed using both the Roche PGMY and DDL SPF 10 systems. In cases where HPV was detected, the majority of low-grade and high-grade lesions contained a single HPV type. However, a minority of cases were found to have multiple HPV types. Of the VIN 1 cases, a low-risk virus was seen in 22 (67 %), with HPV 6 or 11 accounting for 14 (42 %). A high-risk virus was detected in 14 (42 %) of cases of which 2 (6 %) contained HPV 16. Of the VIN 3 cases, all had high-risk HPV of which 31 (91 %) were found to have HPV 16. Of the VaIN 1 cases, 6 (35 %) were found to have low-risk HPV types. HPV 6 or 11 were not found in these cases. High-risk virus was seen in 13 (76 %) VaIN 1 cases, with 1 (6 %) containing HPV 16. HPV was detected in 15 of 16 (94 %) VaIN 3 lesions, all of which had high-risk types. HPV 16 was found in 8 (50 %). In contrast, 2 (6 %) of cervical LSIL had low-risk HPV (HPV 6 and 11), whereas 34 (94 %) of LSIL cases had high-risk HPVs. Of the cervical high-grade squamous intraepithelial lesion cases, 100 % had high-risk HPVs of which 87 (75 %) were found to have HPV 16. The findings demonstrate that a significant number of low-grade vulvar and vaginal lesions contain high-risk HPV types, supporting their designation as low-grade intraepithelial lesions rather than <b>flat</b> <b>condylomas.</b> The low frequency of HPV 16 in VIN 1 compared with VIN 3 suggests they are distinct lesions or that HPV 16 is critical in the progression to VIN 3. Finally, comparison of the distribution of HPV in the vagina and vulva suggests that VaIN is more closely related to cervical intraepithelial neoplasia than to VIN...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Wol fsburg HP V E pidemiological S tudy (WOLVES) is a {{population-based}} {{cohort study}} on HPV infections and associated diseases in the pre-vaccination era in {{young women in}} Wolfsburg, Germany. Methods Women born 1983 / 84 or 1988 / 89 were invited to participate. Participants were recruited in gynecology practices, and completed a questionnaire with socioeconomic, sexual and medical data including vaccination status. Pelvic examination with Pap smear and HPV testing (HC 2 [*]=[*]Hybrid Capture 2) was obligatory. HC 2 -positive and 10 % of HC 2 -negative samples were tested for specific HPV types with SPF- 10 -PCR, and in inconclusive cases with DNA sequencing. Women with genital warts (GW) and those with atypical Pap smears were transferred for colposcopy. GWs were classified as typical condylomata acuminata (TCA), <b>flat</b> <b>condyloma</b> (FC) and seborrheic wart-like (SWL). Results In total, 1258 subjects were recruited from the target population of 2850 (44. 1 %). Overall the prevalence of HC 2 low-risk (LR) types was 8. 5 %. HPV 6 was the most frequent LR type (2. 1 %), followed by HPV 42 (1. 1 %), HPV 11 and HPV 44 (each 0. 4 %). LiPA showed a low sensitivity for HPV types 42, 90 and 91, which were detected only by HC 2 and HPV sequencing. Nine women (0. 7 %) were transferred with incident GW: five TCA, two FC and two SWL. All TCA were associated with HPV 6 in corresponding cervical swabs and warts. Tissues of SWL contained HPV 6 (n[*]=[*] 1) and HPV 16 (n[*]=[*] 1). The cumulative life-risk for GW was 1. 4 % in the 1988 / 89 and 4. 8 % in the 1983 / 84 cohort. Eight of 107 HC 2 -LR[*]+[*]and five of nine cases of GW had concomitant abnormal Pap smears. All CIN lesions could be linked to high-risk HPV types but borderline and low-grade abnormal smears were explained by vaginal and cervical TCA in four cases. Conclusions HC 2 was a specific test {{for the detection of}} established and potential LR types. In this first WOLVES analysis, HPV 6 was the most frequent HPV type and the single LR type linked to disease. The observed GW incidence of 715 per 100, 000 fits well with estimates of healthcare providers. Although life risks for GW were lower than in Scandinavian analyses, the societal burden within the WOLVES populations was considerable. </p...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The HVP {{vaccine is}} {{a useful tool for}} {{preventing}} cervical cancer. The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the most frequent HPV genotypes in Equatorial Guinea in order to develop future vaccination strategies to apply in this country. Methods A campaign against cervical cancer was carried out in the area on a total of 1, 680 women. 26 of the women, following cytological screening, were treated surgically with a loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). Cases were studied histologically and were genotyped from paraffin blocks by applying a commercial kit that recognized 35 HPV types. Results Cytological diagnoses included 17 HSIL, 1 LSIL, 5 ASC-H and 3 AGUS. Histological diagnosis resulted in 3 cases of microinvasive squamous cell carcinoma stage IA of FIGO, 9 CIN- 3, 8 CIN- 2, 2 CIN- 1, 3 <b>flat</b> <b>condylomas</b> and mild dysplasia of the endocervical epithelium. Fifteen of twenty-five cases genotyped were positive for HPV (60 %). HPV 16 and 33 were identified in four cases each, HPV 58 in two other cases, and HPV 18, 31, 52, and 82 in one case, with one HPV 16 and 58 coinfection. Conclusion The frequency of HPV types in the African area varies in comparison to other regions, particularly in Europe and USA. Vaccination against the five most common HPV types (16, 33, 58, 18, and 31) should be considered in the geographic region of West Africa and specifically in Equatorial Guinea. </p...|$|R
40|$|Detection of {{papillomavirus}} DNA in sity {{hybridization technique}} was perfomed in 29 symptomatic patients (6 males and 23 females) {{during the period}} of 1989 - 1991 at the Clinic for Sexually Transmitted Diseases, Universidade Federal Fluminense, State of rio de Janeiro. All the male patients had condyloma acuminata. Only HPV 6 / 11 were found in these lesions. Clinical features inthe female patients included vulvar condyloma acuminata, bowenoid populosis, <b>flat</b> cervical <b>condyloma,</b> cervical condyloma acuminatum and cervical intraepithelialneoplasia grade II (CIN II). We also found cases of condyloma acuminata associated to vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia grade III (VIN III), as well as to vaginal invasive carcinoma. HPV 6 / 11 and 16 / 18 were found in vulvar condyloma acuminata. Mixed infection by 6 / 11 - 16 / 18 HPV were also seen in these lesions {{as well as in the}} patient who had cervical condyloma acuminatum. HPV 16 / 18 were found in the condyloma acuminatum plus VIN III and in the CIN II lesions. We have found HPV 31 / 33 / 51 in the specimen of condyloma acuminatum plus invasive carcinoma. In order to investigate the ultrastructural aspects of HPV infection in genital tissue, the biopsies of three female patients were observed under electron microscope. Mature virus particles were found in the cells of a condyloma acuminatum as wellas in the condyloma acuminatum plus invasive carcinoma case. In another sample, chromosome breakages were found in the nuclei of the infected cells although no viral particles were observed...|$|R
