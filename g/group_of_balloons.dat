50|$|When the Red Dust, {{a deadly}} viral strain toxic to Visitor physiology, was discovered, Resistance {{scientists}} cultivated {{it into a}} weaponized gas weapon. But when word reached the Visitors {{of the development of}} the Dust, Commander Diana planned to use the L.A. Mothership to destroy the Earth with its self-destruct mechanism. This forced the Resistance to divide their forces into one all-out operation; most of the Resistance soldiers would deploy the toxin in hot-air balloons in a massive coordinated release with other groups with their own <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>balloons,</b> and release the toxin into the air. Meanwhile, a small Resistance force would go with an armed Fifth Column assault team to shut down the self-destruct before it went off. The attack was successful and the Resistance was victorious while the Visitors were forced to flee the now-toxic Earth and into space.|$|R

50|$|The film {{starts with}} the narrator (Elijah Wood) {{explaining}} that Henry is a hedgehog who has no friends because he likes to hug everyone. The viewer is then placed inside Henry's home on his birthday where, after a short time, Henry appears from the kitchen with his birthday cake. Sad at being alone on his birthday, Henry lights the candle on his cake and makes a wish before blowing it out. At this point a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> animal <b>balloons</b> come to life and fly around the house, before one approaches Henry for a hug; the balloon pops as Henry tries to hug it. Terrified, the balloons dart around the room {{trying to get away}} from Henry before flying out of the door, leaving Henry alone. Shortly afterwards, a knock at the door reveals that the balloons have returned, bringing with them a turtle. The turtle hugs Henry, without being hurt by his quills, and Henry is happy again.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a work carried {{out for a}} project {{to develop a new}} interactive technique that combines haptic sensation with computer graphics. The project has two goals. The first one is to provide users with a spatially continuous surface on which they can effectively touch an image using any part of their bare hand, including the palm. The second is to present visual and haptic sensation simultaneously by using a single device that doesn 2 ̆ 7 t oblige the users to wear any equipment. In order to achieve these goals, we have developed balloon array volumetric haptic display named Volflex. The Volflex, however, has small range of displayed volume. In this paper, we focus on expanding the ability to present varied shape of virtual object from flat surface to volumetric surface. We designed a new volumetric haptic display named Volflex+. It is composed <b>of</b> a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> air <b>balloons</b> controlled by air cylinders. Each air cylinder is attached to a linear actuator so that each balloon is able to move up/down. This configuration drastically expands presented volume. ...|$|R
40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{undertaken}} {{to assess the}} effectiveness <b>of</b> eye-spot <b>balloons</b> in reducing bird damage to grape crops. The work was undertaken in April 1993 in a Canterbury vineyard {{at the suggestion of}} Pest Management Services Ltd., who market eye-spot balloons. Fieldwork was conducted as a 4 th-year project by a University of Canterbury wildlife management class. Objective • To measure the effect <b>of</b> a small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> eye-spot <b>balloons</b> on bird damage to grapes at various distances from the balloons and at various times before harvest. Methods • Six balloons were hung above a ripening crop of pinot noir grapes five weeks before harvest. • At weekly intervals a visual assessment was made of bird damage to bunches of grapes at distances of up to 40 m from the balloons. Results • Bird damage increased rapidly as harvest approached and the grapes ripened and coloured. • One week before harvest, bird damage to grapes directly beneath the balloons was only 55 % of that recorded 40 m from the balloons. • The deterrent effect <b>of</b> the <b>balloons</b> extended about 20 m {{during the first week of}} the trial, and over shorter distances thereafter. Recommendations • Eye-spot balloons repel pest birds, but need to be used in conjunction with other methods of bird control. • Eye-spot balloons have little effect on birds more than 20 m from them. • Birds begin to habituate to eye-spot balloons within 1 - 2 weeks. Their installation in vineyards should therefore be delayed until shortly before harvest, when the risk of bird damage is greatest. ...|$|R
5000|$|The album artwork, shot in Hill Garden, Hampstead Heath, draws {{inspiration}} from seminal rock album design company Hipgnosis. Upon inadvertently discovering the {{location for the}} cover, Petit presented his ideas for the cover to Hipgnosis principle Storm Thorgerson, aiming to collaborate with the legendary album cover artist for the shoot. This did not materialise due to Thorgerson’s deteriorating health. Discussing the new album with iconic rock photographer and guitarists’ muse Pattie Boyd, {{it was decided that}} she would photograph the cover image. After Petit presented his initial mock-up shots to Boyd, work began on location in Spring 2013. The shot features Petit seemingly walking on water, surrounded by white balloons suspended in mid-air. Petit has since revealed that it was Boyd who suggested he stand {{in the middle of the}} pond featured in the image to create the illusion. [...] "There’s nothing faked. I’m actually standing on a table with about a millimetre of water beneath my shoe. Those balloons are suspended by bricks and tied with fishing line." [...] The white balloons featured on the album artwork were specifically arranged into three <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> three <b>balloons</b> to represent the number sequence 333.|$|R

40|$|Ballooning {{is a form}} of aerial {{movement}} {{practiced by}} most miniature and some adult spiders. Very few studies have investigated the composition and rate <b>of</b> spider <b>ballooning</b> in Australian agroecosystems. Water traps were used to compare ballooning rates in irrigated soybean crops and nearby non-crop areas in southeast Queensland over two summer seasons. The highest ballooning rate (14. 8 spiders/m(2) per day) was recorded in a soybean field, non-crop areas (7. 0 spiders/m(2) per day) and a dry land mungbean field (6. 8 spiders/m(2) per day) having similar rates. Spider ballooning in soybean increased throughout the season and showed three peaks and intervening troughs. A similar pattern in ballooning peaks was observed in non-crop areas however the numbers were lower. Peaks in ballooning activity where synchronised across habitat types and some spider <b>groups.</b> Composition <b>of</b> the <b>ballooning</b> fauna was {{different from that of the}} ground-dwelling fauna, some families being present in both. Ballooning is an important behaviour in terms of population dynamics for a number <b>of</b> spider <b>groups</b> in soybean and the implications for pest control are discussed. (C) 2004 Elsevier BN.

The findings indicate that while choosing the tactics of treatment for patients with coronary heart disease (CHD) and assessing the risk of development of poor outcomes of coronary stenting, it is necessary to take into account a combination of factors significantly affecting the occurrence of coronary events and the development of restenosis after surgery (smoking, acute coronary syndrome at the moment of a procedure, serum triglyceride levels, extent of coronary bed affliction, type of stenosis, diameter of a revas-cularized vessel) and to apply, where possible, the minimal effective exposure principle to achieve the optimal result of a procedure...|$|R
