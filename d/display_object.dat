However, the weekend editions of the program continued to be produced from Fox News' main studio. On December 10, 2008, the program moved again to Studio 12H, a set designed for high-definition broadcasts that was first used for the Fox News-produced 2008 Election Night coverage on the Fox broadcast network, with [...] "The Cube" [...] - a large video <b>display</b> <b>object</b> featuring display of imagery on three facets of the cube - as a major element; both the weekday and weekend broadcasts were produced {{out of the new}} studio.

50|$|The {{core of the}} penveu {{technology}} surrounds {{a camera}} located near {{the tip of the}} pen, but is implemented in two parts of the penveu system: the PEN, and the VEU. The video signal (VGA) that comes from the computer towards the display device (projector or TV monitor) is intercepted by the VEU box. Over there, visual targets are inserted into that video stream. Those targets include position-encoded information, related to the location of each target within the display area. The targets are inserted as increased brightness in one frame, and reduced brightness in the next frame. Due to the flicker fusion threshold, our eyes {{will not be able to}} observe those quick changes, and since the targets in one frame will compensate for the targets in the previous frame, our eyes will only see the “target-free” visual information. The camera in the pen, on the other hand, subtracts consecutive frames. As a result, the camera will only be sensitive to the targets themselves, while ignoring the “human visible” information (the content). There is a powerful Digital signal processor (DSP) in the pen, which calculates the position of the tip based on the information retrieved from the targets detected. In the core of this technology is an engineering discipline from the area of Computer science called Computer Vision. Computer Vision is defined as “Computer vision is a field that includes methods for acquiring, processing, analyzing, and understanding images and, in general, high-dimensional data from the real world in order to produce numerical or symbolic information, e.g., in the forms of decisions”. In the penveu case, this translates into the acquisition of the positioning information through the pen camera, and extracting the position of the tip relative to the displayed image based on that information, and then the interaction with the <b>display</b> <b>object</b> at that location or the dispensing on virtual ink at the location. This camera-based technology is also assisted with a MEMS-based inertial system for better accuracy and smoother performance.|$|E

40|$|Recently we have {{provided}} evidence that observers more readily select a target from a visual search display if the motion {{trajectory of the}} <b>display</b> <b>object</b> suggests that the observer has dealt with it before. Here we test the prediction that this object-based memory effect on search breaks down if the spatiotemporal trajectory is disrupted. Observers searched a display for a target shape among multiple distractors. The entire search display then passed behind an occluder and reemerged in either the same or a different configuration. Experiment 1 shows that the same-object benefit for selection disappears whenever a spatial disruption is involved, but that it may survive a brief temporal disruption. Experiment 2 shows that with sufficiently long gaps, a temporal disruption also destroys the same-object benefit for selective attention. Experiment 3 demonstrates that the same-object effect is even stronger when there only {{is a very small}} probability that the target {{can be found at the}} same location as before. This also made the task sensitive to brief temporal disruptions. We conclude that a coherent spatiotemporal history of a <b>display</b> <b>object</b> supports the selection of its relevant subregions. © 2013 Copyright Taylor and Francis Group, LLC...|$|E
40|$|A {{system and}} method {{provides}} {{for the creation of}} a highly graphical expert system without the need for programming in code. An expert system is created by initially building a data interface, defining appropriate Mission, User-Defined, Inferred, and externally-generated GenSAA (EGG) data variables whose data values will be updated and input into the expert system. Next, rules of the expert system are created by building appropriate conditions of the rules which must be satisfied and then by building appropriate actions of rules which are to be executed upon corresponding conditions being satisfied. Finally, an appropriate user interface is built which can be highly graphical in nature and which can include appropriate message display and/or modification of display characteristics of a graphical <b>display</b> <b>object,</b> to visually alert a user of the expert system of varying data values, upon conditions of a created rule being satisfied. The data interface building, rule building, and user interface building are done in an efficient manner and can be created without the need for programming in code...|$|E
40|$|Yucca-II is a {{consultation}} system {{which is designed}} to provide the UNIX user, through a natural language interface, with detailed expert advice {{on the use of the}} UNIX command language. The most salient architectural feature of Yucca-II is its sharp division into a natural language front end and a formal knowledge base back end, coupled by a formal dynamic query language. This paper describes the knowledge representation techniques used in the back end to represent the appropriate aspects of command language behavior. The emphasis is upon the particular problems encountered in the representation of command language behavior which are not easily addressed within more general knowledge representation frameworks. The most significant include the <b>display</b> <b>object</b> problem, which mandates distinction between an object (such as the contents of a directory) and a display of same, the problem of representing actions whose occurrence is more significant than the details of what they do (such as putting pageheaders on a file), and the problem of representing the interconnective behavior of a large number of commands and options in a succinct fashion. 1...|$|E

40|$|Color coding is used {{to guide}} {{attention}} in computer displays for such critical tasks as baggage screening or air traffic control. It {{has been shown that}} a <b>display</b> <b>object</b> attracts more attention if its color is more similar to the color for which one is searching. However, what does similar precisely mean? Can we predict the amount of attention that a display color will receive during a search for a given target color? To tackle this question, two color-search experiments measuring the selectivity of saccadic eye movements and mapping out its underlying color space were conducted. A variety of mathematical models, predicting saccadic selectivity for given target and display colors, were devised and evaluated. The results suggest that applying a Gaussian function to a weighted Euclidean distance in a slightly modified HSI color space is the best predictor of saccadic selectivity in the chosen paradigm. Hue and intensity information by itself provides a basis for useful predictors, spanning a possibly spherical color space of saccadic selectivity. Although the current models cannot predict saccadic selectivity values {{for a wide variety of}} visual search tasks, they reveal some characteristics of color search that are of both theoretical and applied interest, such as for the design of human–computer interfaces...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{approach}} for recreating life-like experiences through an easy and natural gesture-based interaction. By focusing on the locations and transforming {{the role of the}} user, we are able to significantly maximise the understanding of an ancient cultural practice, behaviour or event over traditional approaches. Technology-based virtual environments that <b>display</b> <b>object</b> reconstructions, old landscapes, cultural artefacts, and scientific phenomena are coming into vogue. In traditional approaches the user is a visitor navigating through these virtual environments observing and picking objects. However, cultural practices and certain behaviours from nature are not normally made explicit and their dynamics still need to be understood. Thus, our research idea is to bring such practices to life by allowing the user to enact them. This means that user may re-live a step-by-step process to understand a practice, behaviour or event. Our solution is to enable the user to enact using gesture-based interaction with sensor-based technologies such as the versatile Kinect. This allows easier and natural ways to interact in multidimensional spaces such as museum exhibits. We use heuristic approaches and semantic models to interpret human gestures that are captured from the user’s skeletal representation. We present and evaluate three applications. For each of the three applications, we integrate these interaction metaphors with gaming elements, thereby achieving a gesture-set to enact a cultural practice, behaviour or event. User evaluation experiments revealed that our approach achieved easy and natural interaction with an overall enhanced learning experience...|$|E
40|$|COVET {{is a group}} {{exhibition}} that explores the rhetoric of display and the various systems, structures and methods of presentation. The exhibition scrutinizes the display objects application in within consumer culture, {{and its role in}} maintaining a desirability of the things around us. This exhibition brings together nine artists whose work disentangles the object from its framing device. When the mechanisms and techniques for staging the object are fore-grounded, the <b>display</b> <b>object</b> itself gets pushed to the background becoming secondary, obsolete and invisible. Its purpose is to generate desirability for other things, never for itself. By taking away or confiscating the objects of display, COVET concentrates instead on specific structural devices full of empty and unfulfilled promises. The primary function of display incorporating plinths, shelves and platforms, is to elevate, promote and show-off the consumable object. Through various media, including mass-produced goods, manufactured items, photography, video, installation and sculpture the works in COVET delve into our cultural investment into material goods. By focusing on the staging and restaging of the display apparatus, there is a new emphasis upon their entropic deficiencies and inherent failure to satisfy. This is an exhibition about exhibiting the void, the unsatisfied and the aesthetics of display. __COVET purports to open up a critique on the rhetoric of display that surrounds us and to stage a moment of collapse, failure and sublimated desire for the architectonics of consumer cultures...|$|E

40|$|Tomorrow's {{display and}} {{interaction}} technology will go beyond standard computer monitors, television and mobile screens and will enable projecting digital content onto any complex physical surface. While devices like the IPod and IPad have received tremendous commercial success, the interaction capabilities for users are still {{limited to a}} small mobile screen. As projectors continue to decrease in size, cost and power consumption, projection technology {{has the potential to}} become as ubiquitous as the standard television or digital cameras in our mobile devices. With this potential comes the opportunity to transform everyday passive objects into interactive display surfaces, freeing content from the confines of a flat monitor display. In this thesis, I explore interacting with everyday objects by representing content as interactive surface particles. Users can build their own physical world, map virtual content onto their physical construction and interact directly with surface using a stylus. While researchers have explored using projectors for interacting with surfaces in our environment, many of these displays are still relegated to walls, tabletop surfaces or simplistic scenes. Furthermore, even fewer research projects describe methods for content creation on complex physical objects. By using a surface particle representation, interaction designers can create programmed content that is independent of the <b>display</b> <b>object</b> and is reusable on many surfaces. I present {{a detailed description of the}} surface particle representation though a projector-camera system that acquires the object geometry and enables direct interaction though an infrared tracked stylus. I also demonstrate three motivating examples each displayed on three example surfaces and discuss a set of interaction techniques that show possible avenues for structuring interaction on complex everyday objects...|$|E
40|$|Motivated {{by these}} problems, we explore the {{potential}} of projectors in interactive information visualization and processing in this thesis. In particular, we make three contributions. First, we propose a computer vision solution for direct 3 D object exhibition and manipulation without the user wearing spectacles. In our approach, a new 3 D display interface is designed by projecting images on a hand-held foam sphere which can be moved freely by the user. By tracking {{the motion of the}} sphere and projecting motion-dependent images onto the sphere, a virtual 3 D perception can be created. Using this interface, the user will experience as if he is holding the real object in hands and be able to control the viewing angle freely. Second, we extend the projection on traditional rigid screen to projection on flexible surfaces. A new flexible display method is proposed, which can project information on a hand-held flexible surface (e. g. an ordinary white paper with a checker pattern at the back) that can be twisted freely. While the user twists the projection surface, the system recovers the deformation of the surface and projects well-tailored information onto the surface corresponding to the deformation. As a result, the viewer will see the information as if it was printed on the paper. Two applications, the flexible image projection and curvilinear data slicing are created to demonstrate the usefulness of the method. After the studies on fixed-position projection, we conduct an investigation on mobile projectors, which is becoming especially necessary with the rapid popularity of mobile projectors. We propose a hand-held movable projection method that can freely project keystone-free content onto a general flat surface without any markings or boundaries on the displaying screen. Compared with traditional static projection systems that keep the projector and screen in fixed positions, our projection scheme can give the user greater freedom of display control while producing undistorted images at the same time. The recent trend of human-computer interaction technologies has revealed {{the potential of}} the projector as an powerful interaction tool. More than a pure display tool, a projector has great strength that can change largely the way a traditional user interface works. Although some possibilities have been investigated in previous work, certain applications and approaches deserve further studies. For example, 1) Projection showing 3 D information: viewing 3 D models is usually achieved by projecting polarized light of different phases for left and right eyes, and the user is required to wear specially designed spectacles. The cost of building such a system is high. 2) Projection on flexible surface: most existing systems display information on flat rigid projection screens, extending it to non-planar flexible surfaces is an interesting and useful research direction; 3) Direct user-info interaction: existing systems using mouse and screen have limited freedom of control and low level of user experience. Direct manipulation of the <b>display</b> <b>object</b> by the hands of a user is more natural; 4) Mobile projector display: portable or embedded projectors {{are becoming more and more}} popular, but some fundamental problems, e. g. the keystone correction, are not fully studied. To verify the correctness of our methods, we built prototype systems using off-the-shelf devices and conducted extensive experiments, including both simulation and real experiments. The results show that the proposed methods are effective and good performance has been achieved. In particular, the real-time speed and low-cost requirement make it quite appealing in many application areas, such as education, digital games, medical applications etc. Capitalizing on the shrinking size, increasing portability, and decreasing cost of projectors, it is predictable that projector-based interactive processing will become more and more popular in the near future. We believe the research work in this thesis will provide a good foundation for further research and development on computer vision and projector-based applications. Li, Zhaorong.
