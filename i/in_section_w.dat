40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} {{theoretical}} analysis {{on how the}} global motion parameter accuracies affect the efficiency of motion compensated video coding. The inaccurate global motion compensation is modelled by introducing probabilis-tic rotation. scale and translation parameter errors. Approx-imate expressions that relate the power spectrum of the pre-diction error to motion parameter errors is derived. By dou-bling {{the accuracy of the}} motion parameters, up to 6 dB the-oretical gains can be obtained in prediction error variance. 1. LNTRODUCTION Global motion estimation (GME) is essential in several ap-plications such as video compression, segmentation, mo-saicing, and image registration. Global motion refers to higher order motion models like aftine or bilinear, which improves the prediction gain over simple translational model. Although many global motion estimation techniques have been proposed, the parameter accuracy vs coding rate anal-ysis have not been performed. Efficiency of motion com-pensated coding with translational motion errors have been studied in [I, 31. Optimizing the translational accuracy for block-based coders is analyzed in [2]. This paper studies the effect of GM parameter inaccura-cies on motion compensated video coding. The 4 -RST (ro-tation, scale translation) motion model used in the analysis is described in Section 11. The power spectrum of the pre-diction error is related to GM parameter errors, and approx-imate expressions for prediction error spectrum is derived in Section 111. The effect of motion accuracy level, the effect of video signal model, and finally the effect of approxima-tion on the prediction gain are studied <b>in</b> <b>Section</b> <b>W,</b> which is followed by conclusion in the last section.

40|$|Excerpt] There is a {{long and}} well {{established}} tradition of studies analysing the pattern and causes of internal migration and assessing the degree of labour market integration in late nineteenth-century Britain. Some studies document the flows of migrants from one area to another and describe migrant characteristics and the directions of the predominant streams of migration. Others analyse the determinants of gross or net migration flows at the region or county level. The questions implicit in these studies are: How mobile was the labour force? What were the major factors which determined individual decisions to migrate? How are these factors reflected in differences in migration flows between regions and {{in the pattern of}} long distance and short distance migration? Did labour mobility increase during the nineteenth century? There is also a strand of the literature which studies the effects of migration and labour mobility on the growth of industries, cities, and regions and above all on wage rates and wage differentials. The questions here are: How far did migration serve to integrate labour markets within and between regions and sectors? Do movements in regional and sectoral wage rates provide evidence of labour market integration? Did the degree of integration increase during the nineteenth century? In this article we provide a framework within which these questions can be addressed and which links together these two separate strands of the literature. Some of the existing literature is reviewed within this framework, and new evidence offered on the questions raised above. The article is organized as follows. In section I a simple framework is set out which stresses the links between migration and labour market integration. In section II the evidence on the character of migration flows, their magnitude and direction is examined. Section III focuses on the determinants of migration flows at the county level, particularly from rural southern counties. This is followed, <b>in</b> <b>section</b> <b>W,</b> with an examination of the effect of rural-urban migration on agricultural wage rates. Section V considers the evidence on regional labour market integration, and is followed by a brief conclusion summarizing the results...|$|E

The concepts of fractals, iterated function systems, and local iterated function systems are discussed and different implementations of compression of both still images and image sequences are reviewed. 1 INTRODUCTION Fractal-based image coding, which {{is sometimes called}} fractal image coding or attractor image coding, is a new method of image compression. In this method, similarities between different scales of the same image are used for compression. The method {{is rooted in the}} work of Mandelbrot, who introduced the concept of fractals and the fractal dimension. This chapter is organized as follows. Section 1 gives a brief review of the concept of fractals and its applications especially in image compression. <b>In</b> <b>Section</b> 2 the principles of iterated function systems (IFS) will be studied.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this short note is to {{summarize}} some recent progress {{in the theory of}} locally analytic representations of reductive groups over p-adic fields. This theory has begun to find applications to number theory, for example to the arithmetic theory of automorphic forms, {{as well as to the}} “p-adic Langlands programme ” (see [3, 4, 5, 10, 11, 12]). I hope that this note can serve as an introduction to the theory for those interested in pursuing such applications. The theory of locally analytic representations relies for its foundations on notions and techniques of functional analysis. We recall some of these notions <b>in</b> <b>Section</b> 1. <b>In</b> <b>Section</b> 2 we describe some important categories of locally analytic representations (originally introduced in [20], [23] and [8]). <b>In</b> <b>Section</b> 3, we discuss the construction of locally analytic representations by applying the functor “pass to locally analytic vectors ” to certain continuous Banach space representations. <b>In</b> <b>Section</b> 4 we briefly describe the process of parabolic induction in the locally analytic situation, which allows one to pass from representations of a Levi subgroup of a reductive group to representations of the reductive group itself, and <b>in</b> <b>Section</b> 5 <b>w...</b>|$|R

50|$|Roosevelt led {{the poll}} in 2,722 counties, the {{greatest}} number ever carried by a candidate up until that time. Of these, 282 {{had never before been}} Democratic. Only 374 remained loyally Republican, whilst Park County, Wyoming recorded no votes, this being the last time a county has failed to record one vote in a Presidential election. It is to be noted, however, that half of the total vote of the nation was cast in just eight states (New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Illinois, Indiana, Michigan, and Wisconsin) and that in these states, Hoover polled 8,592,163 votes. <b>In</b> one <b>section</b> (<b>West</b> South Central), the Republican percentage sank to 16.21%, but <b>in</b> no other <b>section</b> did the party poll less than 30% of the vote cast. However, the relative appeal of the two candidates in 1932 and the decline of the appeal of Hoover as compared with 1928 are shown {{in the fact that the}} Republican vote increased in 1932 in only 87 counties, while the Democratic vote increased in 3,003 counties.|$|R
30|$|To {{investigate}} stratigraphic/temporal {{variations in}} paleomagnetic directions, we collected sedimentary rock samples at 71 stratigraphic sites (horizons) <b>in</b> two stratigraphic <b>sections</b> (eastern and western) in the Oidawara Formation, located near Shuku (Figs.  3 and 4). Samples {{were collected from}} 28 sites <b>in</b> the eastern <b>section</b> (E 1 –E 28) and 43 sites <b>in</b> the western <b>section</b> (<b>W</b> 1 –W 43). The two sections can be confidently correlated using the key marker (tuff) bed described above. The samples consist mostly of siltstone, with two fine tuff sites representing the marker tuff bed (E 12 and W 13). At each site, one to three magnetically oriented cores (25 mm in diameter) were collected using a battery-powered portable drill. Care was taken to obtain long (≥ 10 cm) cores to improve the precision of orientation measurements. Each core was cut in the laboratory into one to four 22 -mm-long cylindrical samples for magnetic measurements.|$|R
