40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} basis of officer decision making during <b>encounters</b> <b>with</b> juvenile suspects, and compares these encounters to those between police and adults. Specifically, two types of officer behavior are examined: the decision to arrest, and the exercise of authority. Officer behavior during <b>encounters</b> <b>with</b> juvenile suspects is compared and contrasted to <b>encounters</b> <b>with</b> adult suspects. Results from multivariate analyses find juveniles are {{significantly more likely to}} be arrested than adults; however, officers do not exercise different levels of authority during interactions with juvenile suspects. Results also indicate that the factors shaping officer behavior varies across age of suspect, namely, the community context and officer's race offer significantly different influences on juveniles than on adults. Other factors also influence officer discretion differently depending on the age of the suspect, most noteworthy being disrespectful demeanor. The results indicate that police officer behavior during <b>encounters</b> <b>with</b> juvenile suspects is very different than during <b>encounters</b> <b>with</b> adults. ...|$|R

5|$|Among {{the extreme}} trans-Neptunian objects are two high {{perihelion}} objects: Sedna and 2012 VP113. Sedna and 2012 VP113 are distant detached objects with perihelia greater than 70 AU.

Previous explanations for the high perihelion of Sedna include a close <b>encounter</b> <b>with</b> an unknown planet on a distant orbit and a distant <b>encounter</b> <b>with</b> a random star {{or a member of}} the Sun's birth cluster that passed near the Solar System.|$|E
