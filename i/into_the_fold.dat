The Canterbury mission had removed to Gaul before Eadbald was brought back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold.</b> During this period the only royal Christian altar in England belonged to Rædwald. By the time of his death, the mission in Kent had been fully re-established.|$|E

The length remains {{up to the}} edge of the sealing flap. <b>The</b> <b>folding</b> tab is inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> corners at another sealing flap (3) when locking <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> box independently by <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> corners at <b>the</b> sealing flap. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for locking a folding box. USE - Folding box for dust and insect resistant packing made of a single piece. ADVANTAGE - The length remains {{up to the edge}} of the sealing flap, and <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> tab is inserted <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> corners at another sealing flap when locking <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> box independently by <b>the</b> <b>folded</b> corners at <b>the</b> sealing flap, and thus ensures mechanical protection and an economical manufacturing of <b>the</b> <b>folding</b> box...|$|R

Calgary first signed Alex Tanguay to a one-year, $1.7 million {{contract}} and then generated considerable debate by signing Olli Jokinen to a two-year, $6 million deal. The re-acquisition of Jokinen was especially surprising to fans and media alike, as the centre was shipped to the New York Rangers in a controversial trade only four months previous after a disappointing 2009–10 season in Calgary. The signing was sharply criticized by local and national media, though reaction amongst fans was mixed as polls suggested only a minority opposed the moves.|$|E
