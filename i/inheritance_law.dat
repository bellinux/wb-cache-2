25|$|Even though Schleswig, Holstein, and Denmark had all had {{the same}} {{hereditary}} ruler for some centuries, the inheritance rules in the three territories were not quite the same. The Dukedoms of Schleswig and Holstein were inherited under the Salic law which ignored females: the Kingdom of Denmark had a slightly different <b>inheritance</b> <b>law</b> which included male heirs inheriting through the female line. In the 19th century this slight difference in <b>inheritance</b> <b>law</b> meant that when the childless King Frederick VII of Denmark died the Kingdom of Denmark would {{be separated from the}} duchies of Schleswig and Holstein because one man would inherit the Kingship and another the Dukedoms, as happened on the death of Frederick in 1863.|$|E

25|$|Though women possess {{significant}} {{property rights}} under the current Brazilian Constitution, de facto inheritance and land reform regimes undermine women's ability to acquire and retain property in Brazil. Under the Civil Code of Brazil, married women could not lawfully acquire or possess their own property until 1962. The <b>inheritance</b> <b>law</b> differs based on matrimonial regimes, {{of which there are}} four: Partial Property Ruling (Comunhão Parcial), Community Property Ruling (Comunhão de Bens), Separate Property Ruling (Separação de Bens), Final Partition of Acquisitions (Participação Final dos Aqüestos).|$|E
25|$|Women face {{discrimination}} in the courts, where the testimony of one man equals that of two women in family and <b>inheritance</b> <b>law.</b> Polygamy is permitted for men, and men have a unilateral right to divorce their wives (talaq) without needing any legal justification.

With regard to the law of inheritance, the Quran specifies that fixed portions of the deceased's estate must be left to the Qur'anic heirs and generally, female heirs receive half the portion of male heirs.|$|E

25|$|The main {{minority}} grievance {{regards the}} appointment of muftis. The Greek government started appointing muftis instead of holding elections {{after the death of}} Mufti of Komotini in 1985 (which is a failure to implement Law 2345/1920 according to Cultural Survival), although the Greek government maintained that as the practice of state-appointed muftis is widespread (including in Turkey), this practice should be adhered to in Greece, and as the muftis perform certain judicial functions in matters of family and <b>inheritance</b> <b>law,</b> the state ought to appoint them. Human Rights Watch alleges that this is against Lausanne Treaty which grants the Muslim minority the right to organize and conduct religious affairs free from government interference (although it is unclear whether issues such as <b>inheritance</b> <b>law</b> are religious matters). As such, there are two muftis for each post, one elected by the participating faithful, and one appointed by Presidential Decree. The elected Mufti of Xanthi is Mr Aga and the government recognized one is Mr Sinikoğlu; the elected Mufti of Komotini is Mr Şerif and the government recognized one is Mr Cemali. According to the Greek government, the elections by which Mr Aga and Mr Şerif were appointed were rigged and involved very little participation from the minority. As pretension of (religious) authority is a criminal offence against the lawful muftis under the Greek Penal Code, both elected muftis were prosecuted and on conviction, both were imprisoned and fined. When, however, the case was taken to the European Court of Human Rights, the Greek government was found to have violated the right to religious freedom of Mr Aga and Mr Şerif.|$|E
25|$|Fundamentalist {{scholars}} {{justify the}} different religious laws {{for men and}} women by referring to the biological and sociological differences between men and women. For example, regarding the <b>inheritance</b> <b>law</b> which states that women’s share of inheritance is half that of men, Ayatollah Makarim Shirazi quotes the Imam Ali ibn Musa Al-reza who reasons {{that at the time of}} marriage man has to pay something to woman and woman receives something, and that men are responsible for both their wives' and their own expenses but women have no responsibility thereof. Women, however, make up 27% of the Iranian labor force, and the percentage of all Iranian women who are economically active has more than doubled from 6.1% in 1986 to 13.7% in 2000.|$|E

25|$|Cavalry {{and battle}} {{exercises}} (often in forms of tournaments) became {{the lifestyle of}} the nobility, as it already was in feudal Western Europe. Usually, a lord was himself one of the soldiers, being the commander of his military retinue, a heavily equipped, constantly exercised mounted warrior, often with destrier, and pursuing the royal grant of knighthood which was a valued title and formed an upper level of the nobility (the uppermost was the circle of royal councillors). Some lesser noblemen remained squires, armigers for their whole lives. Sometimes a nobleman was himself the only soldier that his manor provided for the cavalry and possibly with less-than-adequate equipment. In some cases, some impoverished nobles provided a cavalryman together (it was actually unavoidable if a manor of lesser gentry was divided between several heirs, as the Swedish <b>inheritance</b> <b>law</b> provided, contrary to the primogeniture inheritances of French countries). It was also possible to have the obligation fulfilled by a paid employee - no particular condition required the lord {{himself to be a}} soldier (as evidenced by lord Bo Jonsson Grip, fiefholder of most of Finland, never becoming a soldier himself), it was just the evolving lifestyle of the noble class.|$|E

As a result, Human Rights Watch has described the position of Saudi women as no different from being a minor, with little authority over their own lives.

These include giving approval for the woman to travel, to hold some types of business licenses, to study at a university or college and to work if the type of business is not [...] "deemed appropriate for a woman." [...] Even where a guardian’s approval is not legally required, some officials will still ask for it.

2500|$|The {{museum was}} {{established}} during Soane's own lifetime by a Private Act of Parliament in 1833, which took effect on Soane's death in 1837. The Act required that No. 13 be maintained [...] "as nearly as possible" [...] {{as it was}} left {{at the time of}} Soane's death, and that has largely been done. The Act was necessary because Sir John had a living direct male heir, his son George, with whom he had had a [...] "lifelong feud" [...] due to George's debts, refusal to engage in a trade, and his marriage, of which Sir John disapproved. He also wrote an [...] "anonymous, defamatory piece for the Sunday papers about Sir John, calling him a cheat, a charlatan and a copyist".

2500|$|At {{this time}} it was common to marry off daughters quite young, as soon as a {{suitable}} husband could be found and a dowry put together. [...] Combined with childhood diseases and a high general mortality rate this meant that it was not uncommon for young people to die within a short time of marriage, before their spouses had formed lasting relationships with their families. [...] Under Jewish <b>inheritance</b> <b>law,</b> a husband is his wife's sole heir, but a wife does not inherit from her husband. Thus, no matter who died, the dowry, which represented a substantial sacrifice by the wife's parents for their daughter's happiness, would end up with the husband or his family. As a result, parents became reluctant to give their daughters large dowries, which in turn led to difficulty in finding them husbands. Therefore the synod of Troyes, led by Rabbenu Tam, decreed that if a husband or wife dies within a year of marriage without leaving a surviving child, the dowry would revert to the parents who had given it; if the death was within two years half the dowry would revert. While Rabbenu Tam rescinded this decree before his death, it was reaffirmed by his students in the first synod of SHUM. This decree is today incorporated by reference into the standard Ashkenazi prenuptial contract (tena'im), with the phrase [...] "and in case of absence [...] it will stand as the decree of ShUM"; in some communities even this elliptical mention of death is thought unlucky at a wedding, so it is merely hinted at with the cryptic phrase [...] "and in case, etc." [...] Even if it is not explicitly referenced at all, or if there is no contract, it is assumed that the parties consented to it unless it is explicitly excluded.|$|E
