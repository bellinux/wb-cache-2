A 3 rd horse developed both leukoencephalomalacia and <b>hepatosis</b> after being dosed with another isolate obtained from maize which {{was associated with a}} natural outbreak of the nervous form of the disease. Since leukoencephalomalacia and <b>hepatosis</b> could be induced by the same culture material, it was concluded that both syndromes were manifestations of the same toxicosis. There was also some evidence that leukoencephalomalacia might be specifically induced by the administration of smaller doses of the culture material to horses over a longer period. The clinical signs of nervous disorder included ataxia, paresis, apathy, hypersensitivity, frenzy, and other locomotory and psychic disturbances. Autopsy showed that the brains were oedematous, and focal areas of liquefactive necrosis were present in the cerebral white matter. In 1 case the malacic areas were not confined to the subcortical white matter but were microscopically visible in the cerebral cortex as well. An histopathological examination of the areas bordering on the malacic areas revealed rarefication of the white matter, perivascular haemorrhages, oedema and cellular infiltration composed mainly of plasma cells and eosinophiles. Many of the macrophages in these areas contained lipofuscin-like granules, but these granules also occurred extracellularly in the neuropil. In the layers of the cortex nearest the malacic areas, satellitosis and neurophagia were commonly seen. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP scanjet 5590; 300 dpi.

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} and describe macrospcopic and microscopic liver lesions in pigs necropsied at the forensic discipline during 2 years of study; assessing the hepatopathies prevalence, based on morphopathological criteria (circulatory disorders, dystrophic processes, inflammatory and tumor processes). The study was conducted in the period November 2012 - 90 October 2014. It involved necropsies of 90 swine corpses, aged 3 weeks - 6 months, from intensive swine breeding systems, to elucidate the cause of death. After necropsy and thorough macroscopic examination of the liver and gall bladder samples were taken to carry out microscopic examination. Of the total of 90 necropsied pigs, 65 cases were diagnosed macroscopically and microscopically with hepatopathies (72. 2 %). In the pigs necropsied during the study the following were diagnosed, in decreasing order: dystrophic liver diseases (51. 1 %), inflammatory liver diseases (17. 7 %), circulatory liver diseases (2. 2 %) and liver necrosis (2. 2 %). The most numerous dystrophic liver diseases were lipidic <b>hepatosis</b> followed by protidic <b>hepatosis</b> and pigmentation <b>hepatosis.</b> The inflammatory liver diseases were represented by the parenchymal hepatitis or acute toxic hepatitis, and fibrous purulent hepatitis.

40|$|An {{evaluation}} of the coagulation system has been conducted in vitamin E and/or selenium deficient swine. The partial thromboplastin time, plasma fibrinogen concentration, platelet lipid peroxides, {{as well as the}} fibrinogen/fibrin degradation products were not found to be significantly affected by either vitamin E deficiency, selenium deficiency, or deficiency of both. With selenium deficiency, the prothrombin time was shortened (p less than 0. 05). The platelet count and platelet turnover were greatly decreased by both vitamin E (p less than 0. 001) and selenium deficiency (p less than 0. 005). Further-more, the survival of platelets labelled with 75 Se-selenomethionine and the per cent isotope incorporated into platelets were reduced (p less than 0. 05 and p less than 0. 005) in association with vitamin E deficiency, but not with selenium deficiency. These results were interpreted as evidence of a platelet production defect and possibly a platelet function defect in vitamin E deficient animals. Selenium deficiency were also associated with decreased (p less than 0. 05) survival of fibrinogen labelled with 75 Se-selenomethionine and increased (p less than 0. 05) turnover of fibrinogen. From these fibrinogen kinetic findings, it was considered that chronic low grade disseminated intravascular coagulation possibly occurs in selenium deficient animals, probably in relation to the development of <b>hepatosis</b> dietetica or widespread microvascular damage. However, other possibilities such as increased fibrinogenolysis in relation with <b>hepatosis</b> dietetica or an intrinsic fibrinogen defect due to selenium deficiency also need to be taken into consideration and have not been ruled out in the present study...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAlloxan {{is one of}} the {{frequently}} used beta-cytotoxic agents for the induction of Type- 1 diabetes mellitus in animal models and is the drug of choice in rabbits. Its beta-cytotoxic action results in a sudden release of insulin leading to severe hypoglycaemia and even mortality if glucose therapy is not given. In the present investigation the pathological effects of alloxan induced acute hypoglycaemia were studied in rabbits. New Zealand White rabbits, 1 â 1. 5 kg body weight, were administered alloxan @ 100 mg/kg b. w., as a single intravenous dose. Blood glucose levels were monitored (0 h, 20 min, 1 h, and then hourly up to 5 h) and clinical signs noted. Rabbits dead due to hypoglycaemia were necropsied and histopathology performed. Severe histopathological changes were observed especially in the brain (neuronal degeneration and necrosis), kidneys (nephrosis, nephritis) and liver (<b>hepatosis,</b> hepatitis) and also, other organs. Histopathological observation of beta-cytolysis was suggestive that the drug induced hypoglycaemia is insulin mediated. It was concluded that acute hypoglycaemia causes severe pathological changes and the alloxan induced immediate hypoglycaemia if not managed in time, might exacerbate the pathological effects of hyperglycaemia in the induced diabetic models...|$|E
40|$|AbstractHepatic {{progenitor}} cells (HPCs) are bipotential {{stem cells}} that can differentiate into mature hepatocytes or biliary epithelial cells (BECs). They {{are thought to}} be involved in repair of liver injury and the incidence of hepatic carcinoma. Their physiology is closely associated with the microenvironment where they reside. Lipopolysaccharide (LPS), {{an important component of the}} hepatic pathological microenvironment, is stored in the liver and affects many types of cells in various <b>hepatosis.</b> HPCs may also be influenced by LPS. In this paper, mouse ED 13. 5 E-cadherin+ foetal liver cells were isolated as mouse hepatic progenitor cells (mHPCs). Proliferation of mHPCs was promoted under LPS conditions both inÂ vivo and inÂ vitro. Moreover, LPS enhanced colony formation ability of mHPCs, and blocked them differentiation into mature hepatocytes and formation of a bile duct-liked structure. More importantly, long-term treatment with LPS promoted tumorigenesis of mHPCs in nude mice. Thus, we conclude that LPS may promote aberrant proliferation of mHPCs and restrict their normal differentiation. Long-term exposure of mHPCs to LPS increased the risk of tumour formation. These data provide insight into the links between LPS, HPCs fate, and tumorigenesis, and present novel insight into the relationship between HPCs and their microenvironment...|$|E

Osteochondrosis was also identified in the south-western parts of Namibia as well as southern Botswana and other areas in South Africa. Osteochondrosis has a multifactorial aetiology and this study focused on the role of minerals, particularly phosphorus, in the development of the disease. A significant improvement in the clinical signs in experimental animals and a reduction of osteochondrosis occurred on farms where animals received bioavailable trace minerals and phosphorus as part of a balanced lick. An increase in the occurrence of the disease on farms during severe drought conditions in 2012 â 2013 prompted researchers to investigate the possible role of chronic metabolic acidosis in the pathogenesis of the disease.

40|$|The {{object of}} investigation: not-pedigreed albino he-rats. The {{purpose of the}} work: to study {{the role of the}} liver in {{regulation}} of the spatial-temporal organisation of exchange of iron, the products of the peroxide lipide oxydation and the level of alpha-tocopherol in the blood plasma and erythrocytes membranes, and to experimentally justify the principles of antioxydant chronopharmacocorrection of the processes of hyperlipoperoxidation of the cellular membranes in the <b>hepatosis.</b> The role of the liver in regulation of the day rhythmicity of sideremina, the products of the lipides peroxide oxydation, alphy-tocopherol has been determined. It has been established, that the dismatching of the circadian rhytm of the peroxide lipides oxydation (PLO) in the blood, to be induced with tetrachlormethane, is being accompanied by the inter-system desynchronosis of alpha-tocopherol metabolism, on the base of which, the principles of the chronobiological approach to the antioxidants application have been developed. The principles of the antioxidant chronopharmacocorrection of the processes of the cellular membranes hyperlipoperoxidation with the parenchimatose damage to the liver have been developed.

The bark of this plant contains ï¢ carotene, polifenol, thiamin, saponin, and alkaloiderythralin and erythramin. The {{aim of this}} research was to know the underlying mechanism of itseffect as antiproliferative against Myeloma cells. The bark powder was extracted using ethanol(70 %) and was used for the experiment after freezed drying. Citotoxicity test of this extractperformed LC 50 of 0, 367 mg/ml. The rate of proliferation was observed by doubling time effectagainst proliferating cells. The cells were exposed with ethanolic extract in RPMI 1640 mediumcontaining 1) 0, 25 mg/ml 2) 6, 25 x 10 - 2 mg/ml, and 3) 1, 56 x 10 - 2 mg/ml and every 0, 6, 12, 24, 48,and 72 hours cell were counted. The result showed that extract treated cells delayed proliferation atall concentration with doubling time dose 2) of 161, 38 hours, and dose 3) of 93, 91 hours, whereasdoubling time of control cells were 69, 86 hours. Ethidium bromide staining of extract treated cellsshowed apoptosis like profile. These results indicated that ethanolic extract of the bark of Erythrinafusca Lour has an antiproliverative effect on Myeloma cell line. Several mechanisms might accountfor this effect, like inhibiting cell cycle progression, signal transduction, causing delayed andapoptosi...|$|E
40|$|Unusual {{clinical}} and pathological observations {{in the field}} in goats and sheep suffering from Strongy-loides papillosus infection prompted experimental work on this parasite. Goats were infected percu-taneously with either single or multiple, low or high levels of S. papi/losus. Young goats up to 12 months of age were found to be the most susceptible. Some animals, however, showed substantial resist-ance to infective doses. Clinical signs included transient diarrhoea, misshapen, elongated faecal pellets terminally, dehydration, anorexia, cachexia, gnashing of teeth, foaming at the mouth, anaemia and nervous signs such as ataxia, a wide-based stance, stupor and nystagmus. A 'pushing syndrome' was seen in 22 % of the animals. The pathological changes are described and included enteritis, sta-tus spongiosus in the brain, <b>hepatosis</b> leading to rupture of the liver, nephrosis, pulmonary oedema, interstitial pneumonia and pneumonia. About 6 % of the goats died acutely from fatal hepatic rupture. The development of an acquired immunity was determined. The immunity elicited an allergic skin re-action at the application site of larvae or injection sites of larval metabolites. This immunity, however, could be breached by large doses of larvae. The most profound clinicopathological changes induced by the parasites were an anaemia (most pronounced in the young goats) and hypophosphataemia. Trace element analyses provided evidence of Cu, Mn and possibly Se deficiencies in some goats...|$|E
