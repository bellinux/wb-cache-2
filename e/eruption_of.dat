5|$|A {{technique}} for altering the natural progression of eruption is employed by orthodontists {{who wish to}} delay or speed up the <b>eruption</b> <b>of</b> certain teeth for reasons of space maintenance or otherwise preventing crowding and/or spacing. If a primary tooth is extracted before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the <b>eruption</b> <b>of</b> the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if {{the roots of the}} permanent tooth are more than ⅔ complete, the <b>eruption</b> <b>of</b> the permanent tooth will be accelerated. Between ⅓ and ⅔, it is unknown exactly what will occur to the speed of eruption.|$|E

50|$|<b>Eruptions</b> <b>of</b> {{rhyolite}} {{are relatively}} rare compared to <b>eruptions</b> <b>of</b> less felsic lavas.

50|$|In the west, the Columbia River Basalts {{are just}} that-almost {{exclusively}} black basalt. Not {{so in the}} Snake River Plain, where relatively quiet <b>eruptions</b> <b>of</b> soupy black basalt lava flows alternated with tremendous explosive <b>eruptions</b> <b>of</b> rhyolite, a light-colored volcanic rock.|$|R
5|$|Since then, {{the volcano}} has been dormant, {{although}} some steam still rises from small vents in its summit {{and on its}} flanks. Pumice ejected during the 1915 <b>eruption</b> <b>of</b> Lassen Peak is conspicuously banded with light streaks of dacite and dark andesite, which appears to represent two distinct magmas imperfectly mixed during the eruption. The 1915 <b>eruption</b> <b>of</b> Lassen Peak was the second most recent volcanic outburst in the contiguous 48 U.S. states (after the 1980 <b>eruption</b> <b>of</b> Mount St. Helens in Washington).|$|E

5|$|In April 2010 {{airspace}} {{all over}} Europe was affected, with many flights cancelled-which was unprecedented-due {{to the presence}} of volcanic ash in the upper atmosphere from the <b>eruption</b> <b>of</b> the Icelandic volcano Eyjafjallajökull. On 15 April 2010 the Finnish Air Force halted training flights when damage was found from volcanic dust ingestion by the engines of one of its Boeing F-18 Hornet fighters. On 22 April 2010 UK RAF Typhoon training flights were also temporarily suspended after deposits of volcanic ash were found in a jet's engines. In June 2011 there were similar closures of airspace in Chile, Argentina, Brazil, Australia and New Zealand, following the <b>eruption</b> <b>of</b> Puyehue-Cordón Caulle, Chile.|$|E
50|$|She was {{declared}} patroness of the Canary Islands in 1559, by Clement VIII (and principal patroness in 1867 by Pope Pius IX). The Virgin of Candelaria is widely prayed to for protection against epidemics, plagues, droughts and volcanic <b>eruptions</b> <b>of</b> Mount Teide and other volcanoes, {{in a manner}} similar to the invocation of St. Januarius of Naples to stop the <b>eruptions</b> <b>of</b> Vesuvius and of St. Agatha <b>of</b> Catania to <b>eruptions</b> <b>of</b> Mount Etna in Sicily.|$|R

5|$|Mount Pelée, Martinique. The 1902 <b>eruption</b> <b>of</b> Mount Pelée {{completely}} {{devastated the}} island, destroying {{the town of}} St. Pierre and leaving only 3 survivors. The eruption was directly preceded by lava dome growth.|$|E
5|$|Since the <b>eruption</b> <b>of</b> 1932 Quizapu {{has been}} quiet. In 1949 and 1967 small ash clouds were reported, {{while in the}} 1980s {{there were no signs}} of {{activity}} other than fumaroles.|$|E
5|$|There {{are many}} active volcanoes {{such as the}} Mayon Volcano, Mount Pinatubo, and Taal Volcano. The <b>eruption</b> <b>of</b> Mount Pinatubo in June 1991 {{produced}} the second largest terrestrial <b>eruption</b> <b>of</b> the 20thcentury. Not all notable geographic features are so violent or destructive. A more serene legacy of the geological disturbances is the Puerto Princesa Subterranean River, the area represents a habitat for biodiversity conservation, the site also contains a full mountain-to-the-sea ecosystem and {{has some of the}} most important forests in Asia.|$|E

5|$|Further hazards {{exist in}} the form of snowpack on about half of the volcanoes; under the {{influence}} of pyroclastic flows, the snowpack can melt, generating dangerous lahars such as the one generated by the 1985 <b>eruption</b> <b>of</b> Nevado del Ruiz volcano in Colombia. This eruption claimed 23,000 fatalities, and lahars are a major cause of volcanic eruption associated fatalities.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, Indonesia has 127 active volcanoes {{with about}} 5 {{million people have}} {{activities}} within the danger zone. The earthquake and tsunami event of 26 December 2004 is thought to bring disruption to the volcanoes' eruption pattern.

5|$|Kwee's {{work is the}} {{earliest}} of three Chinese Malay novels which were inspired by volcanic eruptions. The second, Liem Khing Hoo's Meledaknja Goenoeng Keloet (The <b>Eruption</b> <b>of</b> Mount Kelud), was inspired by Kelud in East Java and {{was published in the}} monthly magazine Tjerita Roman in 1929. The third, Kwee's Drama dari Merapie (Drama of Merapi), was inspired by Central Java's Mount Merapi and was published as a serial in Moestika Romans from March to September 1931. Volcanic eruptions also featured in contemporary Chinese Malay poetry. Claudine Salmon records one syair, Ong Tjong Sian's Sair Petjanja Goenoeng Krakatau (Syair on the <b>Eruption</b> <b>of</b> Mount Krakatoa; 1929), as dealing with the community's fears after Krakatoa resumed activity.|$|E
