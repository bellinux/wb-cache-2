25|$|Vickers {{set up a}} {{partnership}} with the French aircraft manufacturer, Société des Avions Michel Wibault to exploit the patented system of all-metal construction developed by Michel Wibault. This used corrugated light alloy skin panels, and made for <b>easy</b> <b>maintenance</b> and inspection. As part of this partnership, Vickers placed an order with Wibault for a single Wibault 7, re-engined with a Bristol Jupiter VI radial engine, to act as a prototype for potential licensed production. The Wibault 7, and therefore the Vickers licensed copy, were single-engine high-wing parasol monoplanes.|$|E

25|$|Its hammer {{action is}} built into a {{removable}} assembly for <b>easy</b> <b>maintenance,</b> after the fashion of the Tokarev TT-30 pistol, whereas its slide rides inside the frame rails, rather than outside as in the traditional Browning pattern. This latter feature mimics the frame-to-receiver interface of its predecessor in Swiss military service, the Luger pistol, allowing for a very tight fit between the slide, barrel and frame without compromising reliability. This construction feature contributes to the unusually high accuracy for which the SIG P210 is known. It ships with a 50-meter (54.7 yd) test target typically showing a group of five to ten shots in a cluster under 5cm (2in) in diameter.|$|E
25|$|Parabolic Aluminized Reflector lights, or PAR lights, or PAR cans, {{are used}} when a {{substantial}} amount of flat lighting is required for a scene. A PAR can is a sealed beam PAR lamp housed in a simple can-like unit. Like an old-fashioned automotive headlight, the reflector is integral to the lamp and the beam spread of the unit is not adjustable except by changing the lamp. PAR lamps are widely used in architectural lighting and may often be found at hardware stores. PAR lights have seen heavy use in rock and roll shows, especially those with smaller budgets, due to their low cost, light weight, <b>easy</b> <b>maintenance,</b> high durability, and high output. They are often used in combination with smoke or haze machines which make the path of the beam visible. They are also often used as top, back, or side lights in the theatre and for special effects.|$|E

2500|$|The L.66 was {{intended}} to be a low cost, <b>easy</b> <b>maintenance</b> two-seater. Thus a low power engine was required and the prototype was fitted with a [...] Haacke HFM-2 flat twin, though other engines could be used. It was a cantilever parasol monoplane with an aerodynamically thick airfoil section wing, which had a simple, rectangular plan and significant dihedral. [...] The wing was a wooden structure with two spars, the ailerons mounted directly to a rounded groove in the rear spar. [...] It was linked to the upper fuselage by a rather complicated set of struts.|$|E
2500|$|The Clubman/Turbostar/Electrostar {{platform}} is a modular design, optimised for speedy manufacture and <b>easy</b> <b>maintenance.</b> It {{consists of an}} underframe, which is created by seam-welding a number of aluminium alloy extrusions, upon which bodyside panels are mounted followed by a single piece roof, again made from extruded sections. The car ends (cabs) are made from glass-reinforced plastic and steel, and are huck-bolted onto the main car bodies. Underframe components are collected in 'rafts', which are bolted into slots on the underframe extrusion. The mostly aluminium alloy body gives light weight to help acceleration and energy efficiency. Electrostar units have a shorter [...] version of the Turbostar's [...] body as Electrostars have 3 or 4 cars per unit rather than 2 or 3 for Turbostars.|$|E
2500|$|In {{herringbone}} {{and parallel}} parlors, the milker generally milks one row at a time. The milker will move {{a row of}} cows from the holding yard into the milking parlor, and milk each cow in that row. Once all of the milking machines {{have been removed from}} the milked row, the milker releases the cows to their feed. A new group of cows is then loaded into the now vacant side and the process repeats until all cows are milked. Depending {{on the size of the}} milking parlor, which normally is the bottleneck, these rows of cows can range from four to sixty at a time.

2500|$|The {{fuselage}} was an alloy-skinned {{monocoque structure}} of polygonal section, and the thicker plates of the wings were also stressed, taking the drag loads. The wings carried 90° flaps {{and there was}} a wide track, inward-retracting main undercarriage plus a small fixed tailwheel. Both the flaps and undercarriage were electrically operated. [...] The deep RAF 34 wing section eased the installation of the required eight Browning machine guns. [...] The Venom was powered by a [...] Bristol Aquila AE-3S sleeve valve radial engine, hinge-mounted so it could be swung sideways for <b>easy</b> <b>maintenance.</b> [...] The Aquila drove a three-bladed propeller.

2500|$|A {{focus on}} <b>easy</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{would reduce the}} {{operating}} costs of the HL-20 PLS. [...] The vehicle would be prepared in a horizontal position, and its large exterior access panels permit easy access to subsystems, allowing easy servicing or replacement. [...] The selection and design of these subsystems would emphasize simplicity and reduce maintenance requirements: for example, hydraulic systems would be replaced by all-electric controls. [...] Moreover, unlike the Space Shuttle, the HL-20 {{would not have a}} payload bay or main engine propulsion, and its thermal protection system, while similar to the Space Shuttle's combination of tiles and ablative coatings, would be far quicker to inspect and maintain due to the HL-20's much smaller size. These design changes and subsystem simplifications, along with the adoption of aircraft maintenance philosophies, could reduce the HL-20 preparation man-hours to less than 10 percent of the Space Shuttle Orbiter's requirement.|$|E
