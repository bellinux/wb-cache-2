40|$|As {{described}} in the previous article in this series [1], {{the first step toward}} getting a sound draft for a problem pattern is to assign colors to its warp and weft threads. Consider this simple twill: To start, a color needs to be assigned to some thread. Suppose the <b>first</b> <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> is white: W This choice has immediate implications. To satisfy the pattern, the first and second warp threads must be black: These colors are forced: W B B The black warp threads in turn force the rest of the weft threads to be white, and these force the rest of the warp threads to be black:...|$|E
5000|$|In basketweave, {{groups of}} warp and <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are {{interlaced}} {{so that they}} form a simple criss-cross pattern. Each group of <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> crosses {{an equal number of}} warp threads by going over one group, then under the next, and so on. The next group of <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> goes under the warp threads that its neighbor went over, and vice versa.|$|R
50|$|Picks per inch/Inch (or p.p.i.) is {{the number}} of <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> per inch of woven fabric. A pick is a single <b>weft</b> <b>thread,</b> hence the term. In general, the higher the picks per inch, the finer the fabric is.|$|R
50|$|Cutwork {{is related}} to drawn thread work. In drawn thread work, {{typically}} only the warp or <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are withdrawn (cut and removed), and the remaining threads in the resulting hole are bound in various ways. In other types of cutwork, both warp and <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> may be drawn.|$|R
5000|$|In plain weave, {{the warp}} and weft are aligned so they form a simple {{criss-cross}} pattern. Each <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> crosses the warp threads by going over one, then under the next, and so on. The next <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> goes under the warp threads that its neighbor went over, and vice versa.|$|R

5000|$|The bias {{grain of}} a piece of woven fabric, usually {{referred}} to simply as [...] "the bias", is at 45 degrees to its warp and <b>weft</b> <b>threads.</b> Every piece of woven fabric has two biases, perpendicular to each other. A garment made of woven fabric is said to be [...] "cut on the bias" [...] when the fabric's warp and <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are at 45 degrees to its major seam lines.|$|R

50|$|When weaving on a loom, {{the beads}} {{are locked in}} between the warp <b>threads</b> by the <b>weft</b> <b>threads.</b> The most common bead weaving {{technique}} requires two passes of the <b>weft</b> <b>thread.</b> <b>First,</b> an entire row of beads is strung on the <b>weft</b> <b>thread.</b> Then the beads are pressed in between the warp threads. The needle is passed back through the beads above the warp threads to lock the beads into place. Heddle looms were popular {{near the beginning of}} the 20th century. They allowed weaving of beads by raising every other thread and inserting strung beads in the shed, the space between the lowered and raised threads. There are still a few Heddle Bead Looms being manufactured today. The most difficult part of loomwork is finishing off the warp threads.|$|R
40|$|Classical (or biaxial) twill is {{a textile}} weave {{in which the}} <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> pass over and under two or more warp threads, with an offset between {{adjacent}} <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> to give an appearance of diagonal lines. This paper introduces a theoretical framework for constructing twill-woven objects, i. e., cyclic twill-weavings on arbitrary surfaces, and it provides methods to convert polygonal meshes into twill-woven objects. It also develops a general technique to obtain exact triaxial-woven objects from an arbitrary polygonal mesh surface. 1...|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} denim is indigo denim, {{in which the}} warp thread is dyed, while the <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> is left white. As {{a result of the}} warp-faced twill weaving, one side of the textile is {{dominated}} by the blue warp threads and the other side is dominated by the white <b>weft</b> <b>threads.</b> This causes blue jeans to be white on the inside. The indigo dyeing process, in which the core of the warp threads remains white, creates denim's signature fading characteristics.|$|R

5000|$|Interlocking method - two wefts are {{interlocked}} {{with each other}} where the colour change is required. The figuring weft is made {{of a number of}} coloured threads, weaving plain with warp threads and interlocked on either side with the grounds <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are invariably gold threads which interlock with the figure <b>weft</b> <b>threads,</b> thus forming the figure. This system of interlocking weaves, known as kadiyal, is done so that there are no extra floats {{on the back of the}} motif thus making the design nearly reversible.|$|R
40|$|Basic weave {{structures}} — interlacement patterns — can {{be described}} in many ways, but they all come down to representing the crossings of warp and <b>weft</b> <b>threads.</b> One or the other is on top. This is represented in drawdowns by a grid in which the cells represent the intersections and (usually) a cell is black if the warp thread is on top but white if the <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> is on top. See Figure Ω. 1. Note: This material should be covered in the introduction to the book. Figure Ω. 1. Drawdown From a computational point of view, 1 s and 0 s instead of colors are the natural representation of interlacement patterns. See Figure Ω. 2, which corresponds to the drawdown of Figure Ω. 1.

50|$|Tent stitch is a small, {{diagonal}} needlepoint stitch {{that crosses}} over {{the intersection of}} one horizontal (weft) and one vertical (warp) thread of needlepoint canvas forming a slanted stitch at a 45-degree angle. It {{is also known as}} Needlepoint stitch {{and is one of the}} most basic and versatile stitches used in Needlepoint and other Canvas work embroidery. When worked on fine weave canvas over a single warp and <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> it is known as Petit point in contrast to stitches, such as Gobelin, worked over multiple warp and/or <b>weft</b> <b>threads.</b>|$|R
50|$|Tapestry {{is a form}} of textile art, {{traditionally}} woven on {{a vertical}} loom. Tapestry is weft-faced weaving, in which all the warp threads are hidden in the completed work, unlike cloth weaving where both the warp and the <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> may be visible. In tapestry weaving, weft yarns are typically discontinuous; the artisan interlaces each coloured weft back and forth in its own small pattern area. It is a plain weft-faced weave having <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> of different colours worked over portions of the warp to form the design.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are other}} more {{advanced}} techniques in which, instead of merely allowing warp threads to alternate in their {{up or down}} positions, individual threads are brought to the surface to form {{what is called a}} [...] "pick up" [...] pattern. One side of the band will show the exposed surfaces of warp threads while, {{on the other side of}} the pattern, the <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> will be visible. Using a supplemental <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> that will come up over the top of certain warp threads, brocaded designs can also be worked into the inkle band.|$|R
50|$|Most weavers use {{a natural}} warp thread, such as linen or cotton. The <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are usually wool or cotton, but may include silk, gold, silver, or other alternatives.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Soumak weave wraps the <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> over 4 warps {{and back}} over 2. The weaver may sometimes, as here, go {{backwards}} and forwards, reversing {{the direction of}} the wrapping.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{structural}} <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> alternate with supplementary weft {{that rises}} {{from the surface of}} the weave at a perpendicular angle. This supplementary weft is attached to the warp by one of three knots...to form the pile or nap of the carpet." [...] Knots are tied in rows, one to each pair of warp threads, which may then be pushed down to make the rug more solid: [...] "the interwoven warp and <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> form the carpet's foundation, and the design comes from the rows of knots." [...] "In the knotted-pile...the arrangement of rows of weft is the dominant consideration." ...|$|R
50|$|Split {{tapestry}} weave - {{the simplest}} weave where two <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are woven up to adjacent warp threads and then reversed. The warp threads are then cut and retied {{to a different}} colour.|$|R
50|$|The cross grain runs {{perpendicular}} to the selvedge and parallel to the <b>weft</b> <b>threads.</b> The cross grain generally has more stretch than the straight grain since the <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are generally looser than the warp during weaving. Most garments (like pants or shirts) are cut on the straight grain with the cross grain parallel with the floor when the wearer is standing. This allows more stretch through {{the width of the}} garment, such as in a pants leg which needs more circumferential than vertical stretch. Garments are sometimes cut on the cross grain, generally because the pieces are too wide to fit on the straight grain.|$|R
50|$|The Cambodian ikat is a weft ikat woven of silk on a {{multi-shaft}} loom with {{an uneven}} twill weave, {{which results in}} the <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> showing more prominently {{on the front of}} the fabric than the back.|$|R
50|$|A Balanced {{plain weave}} is a fabric {{in which the}} warp <b>threads</b> and the <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are equally spaced, and are {{identical}} or similar in size. The term {{can be used for}} a tabby weave or a basket weave.|$|R
5000|$|Cloth of gold {{is not to}} be {{confused}} with various gold embroidery techniques that date to the early Middle Ages, though the type of goldwork thread called [...] "passing" [...] is identical to the <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> of cloth of gold.|$|R
5000|$|In {{industry}} the selvage may be {{thicker than}} the rest of the fabric, and is where the main <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are reinforced with a tight weft back binding to prevent fraying. More simply, they [...] "finish" [...] the left and right-hand edges of fabric as it exits the loom, especially for the ubiquitous [...] "criss-cross" [...] simple or tabby weave, referred to in industry as taffeta weave. Selvages on machine-woven fabric often have little holes along their length, through the thick part, and can also have some fringe. The type or motion of selvage depends on the weaving technique or loom used. A water- or air-jet loom creates a fringed selvage that is the same weight as the rest of the cloth, as by the <b>weft</b> <b>thread</b> is drawn via a jet nozzle, which sends the <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> through the shed with a pulse of water. The selvage is then created by a heat cutter which trims the thread at both ends close to the edge of the cloth, and then it is beaten into place. Thus it creates a firm selvage with the same thickness as the rest of the cloth.|$|R
5000|$|Jali stitch is {{one where}} the thread is never drawn through the fabric, {{ensuring}} that the back portion of the garment looks as impeccable as the front. The warp and <b>weft</b> <b>threads</b> are carefully drawn apart and minute buttonhole stitches are inserted into the cloth.|$|R
