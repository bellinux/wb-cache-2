40|$|<b>Egg</b> <b>white</b> is {{extensively}} utilized as {{a functional}} food material in food processing {{due to the}} multiple functional roles of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> proteins such as foaming, gelling and emulsifying properties. The foaming property of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> has been widely studied using different methods. In this research, two different foaming methods were used to prepare <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> foams by a whipping method using a standard mix beater and a sparging method using a whipped cream dispenser (pressurized dispenser). <b>Egg</b> <b>white</b> is also commercially available in several different physical forms, such as fresh <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> liquid, frozen fresh <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> liquid (EWL) and spray dried <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> powder (EWP). In this study, EWL and EWP solutions were used to compare their foaming ability and foam stability. Various factors affecting on the formation and stability of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> foam were investigated to understand {{their impact on the}} functional properties of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> as foaming agents under specific conditions, including whipping time and speed, shaking time, temperature, pH, type and ionic strength of salts, thermal treatment and addition of some ingredients (e. g. sugar and hydrocolloids). All foams produced were analysed on the basis of two different parameters of foam properties, such as foamability after preparation and foam stability with time after foam preparation. Foam stability was also analysed by two different aspects, foam volume stability against foam collapse and foam liquid stability against liquid drainage. Another objective {{of this study was to}} investigate the application of cooking <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> foam in a microwave oven after the foam preparation with an aim of developing a prototype of value added new products derived from <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> foam. The microbiological stability of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> was also measured to determine the shelf stability of non-pasteurised and pasteurised <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> solutions with and without added ingredients against microbial growth.

Morris left the United States in 1903 to work in Cerro de Pasco, a city in central Peru. In 1916, he opened Morris' Bar in Lima, and his saloon quickly became a popular spot for the Peruvian upper class and English-speaking foreigners. The pisco sour underwent several changes until Mario Bruiget, a Peruvian bartender working at Morris' Bar, created the modern Peruvian recipe of the cocktail {{in the latter part of}} the 1920s by adding Angostura bitters and <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> to the mix.|$|E

5|$|The {{settlement}} was expanded by {{the construction of}} trenches bordering a second adjoining space to the northeast with two additional access points named Ampanidinamporona and Ambavahaditsiombiomby, the latter a natural gateway formed by two boulders. This latter entrance was most likely used to access the space even before the formal establishment of a royal city there, and is therefore considered by archaeologists to be the oldest gateway at the site. After {{the establishment of the}} rova, this entrance was reserved for use by the sovereign, a reflection of the spiritual significance of the northeastern direction and its association with the ancestors, whose benediction and hasina provided the basis for the sovereign's power and legitimacy. It was also used to bring sacrificial cattle into the compound. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana then expanded toward the west to a series of natural defenses, including stony cliffs and steep forested slopes that obviated the need to dig defensive trenches, and he constructed several additional gates that he named Ambavahadimahazaza, Andranomboahangy and Ambavahadiantandranomasina. Andrianampoinimerina expanded the trenches around the city using fanampoana labor. During his reign, a trench was dug that entirely encircles the hill, and a series of trenches was dug alongside existing ones to further protect the city against enemies. The current defensive wall was reconstructed around 1830 during the reign of Queen Ranavalona I. An estimated sixteen million <b>egg</b> <b>whites</b> were mixed with lime to produce the whitewash for the compound's exterior and interior walls.

This protective system relies on an arsenal of antimicrobial proteins and on intrinsic physicochemical properties that are generally unfavorable for bacterial multiplication and dissemination. Some changes in these parameters can be observed in <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> during <b>egg</b> storage and incubation. The aim of this work was to characterize changes in the antibacterial potential of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> in embryonated <b>eggs</b> (FE) during the first half of incubation using unfertilized eggs (UF) as controls. <b>Egg</b> <b>white</b> samples were collected at day zero, 4, 8, and 12 and analyzed for pH, protein concentration, and protein profile. Antibacterial properties of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> proteins were evaluated against Listeria monocytogenes, Streptococcus uberis, Staphylococcus aureus, Escherichia coli, and Salmonella Enteritidis. During incubation, differential variations of <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> pH and protein concentrations were observed between UF and FE. At equal protein concentrations, similar activities against L. monocytogenes and S. uberis were observed for FE and UF <b>egg</b> <b>white</b> proteins.
