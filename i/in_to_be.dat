Graham was asked to write an episode primarily for children which would soften the much darker finale that would be broadcast after. The episode was watched by 7.14 million viewers in the UK, and was given an Appreciation Index of 83. Though Graham received letters from children who enjoyed the episode, it did not generate a positive response from adult fans and critics.|$|E

5|$|After 1943, {{more of the}} team's {{players were}} drafted into military, and the Yankees ended 1944 in third place, one {{position}} higher than they finished the following season. A group consisting of Larry MacPhail, Dan Topping, and Del Webb bought the Yankees, their stadium, and the franchise's minor league teams for $2,800,000 in 1945. Under the new ownership, Yankee Stadium underwent extensive renovations that included the installation of lights. With the war over {{and the return of}} players from overseas, the Yankees set an MLB single-season home attendance record by attracting 2,265,512 fans in 1946. McCarthy resigned as manager early in the season. The Yankees used two other managers during the year (Bill Dickey and Johnny Neun), and ended 1946 in third place. Catcher Yogi Berra made his Yankees debut that year; in his 18-season career, Berra won the AL MVP Award three times. Bucky Harris was brought <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the manager, and his 1947 team won the AL pennant and defeated the Dodgers in a seven-game World Series. After the end of the Series, MacPhail sold his share of Yankees ownership to Topping and Webb for $2million.|$|E
5|$|At Zeus Genetics clinic, Scully overhears a {{pregnant}} woman, Mary Hendershot (Saxon Trainor), who is telling her doctor {{that she does}} not want to be under his care any more. In order to avoid being seen, Scully hides in a storeroom, finding it full of preserved fetuses that resemble the alien child seen earlier, but she is discovered by a doctor, Dr. Lev. Scully then phones Dr. Parenti, who is dissecting an alien fetus. She asks him to compare her ultrasound scan with the one given to her earlier. Later, while waiting to be attended to by Dr. Parenti, she has another flashback, recalling the time she sought a second opinion about her ova from Dr. Parenti, and was told that her ova might be viable with a sperm donor. In the present, she is called <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> attended to, and she is then assured her scans are in order. Later, Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) and Doggett confront Duffy about threatening letters he has been sending to both Mulder and Dr. Lev. However, when the agents leave, Duffy makes a phone call to Lev, warning him that they are being investigated. In another flashback, Scully asks Mulder to be the donor, to which he happily agrees.|$|E
5|$|The party {{returns to}} Alexandria to install Garnet as queen, but are {{assaulted}} at her coronation by Kuja. Garnet and Eiko summon an eidolon to combat Kuja's; when Kuja {{tries to take}} control of their eidolon, he is stopped by an old man named Garland, who then uses Kuja's ship to destroy Garnet's eidolon and damage the city. Kuja flees with the intent to fight Garland for power. Seeking to stop both of them, the party gets an experimental airship from Cid that runs on steam rather than Mist, which will allow them to journey to the other continents. Chasing Kuja, they find a portal to the parallel world of Terra; there they discover that Terra is dying, and its people created Garland to orchestrate merging the two worlds. Garland in turn created Genomes, self-aware soulless beings which would be taken over by Terran souls after the merging. The Iifa Tree serves to block Gaian souls from leaving Gaia but letting Terran souls <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> reborn into the Genomes, with the Gaian souls transformed into the Mist. Kuja and Zidane are Genomes, and Kuja turned against Garland to avoid being taken over {{at the conclusion of the}} plan. Kuja kills Garland with his newly gained powers, then destroys Terra as the party flees to Gaia with the Genomes.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{masks are}} a dancer’s prized possession. Most dancers {{try to keep}} their mask in new {{condition}} and will take masks <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> cleaned and repainted. In a number of communities, such as the Chontals in Tabasco, masks are generally kept in the local church when not in use. At {{the other end of}} the spectrum, the masking, wearing and destruction of a mask is part of Holy Week rituals among the Cora, Yaqui and Mayo. The Cora destroy their paper mache masks by immersing them in a local river while the Yaqui and Mayo burn them. In both cases, it is an act of purification.|$|E

25|$|Czechoslovak-produced T-34-85s {{were used}} by Egypt in the Arab-Israeli Wars of 1956 and 1967 in the Sinai Peninsula. Egypt went on to build the T-34-100, a local and unique {{conversion}} that {{was made up of}} a Soviet BS-3 100mm heavy field-artillery gun mounted within a modified turret of the T-34-85. In 1956, they were used as regular tanks to support Egyptian infantry, but by 1967, they were simply dug <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> used as defensive gun-emplacements. Israel captured many of Egypt's T-34-85s but it is unknown if they ever saw active service in the Israeli Army, but it is known that the captured Egyptian T-34-85s were re-painted by Israel and also displayed on parade after the Suez Crisis of 1956 with Israeli Army markings.|$|E

No TV, no play, I was simply somebody who said I have a sensibility, I think I can do this, based on nothing other than my scripts basically.|$|E

25|$|The {{history of}} FireHouse {{can be traced}} back to 1984, when Leverty's band White Heat needed a drummer. After over 20 auditions, current FireHouse drummer Michael Foster {{answered}} the ad and when Leverty was impressed by his skill, he quickly hired him. When the band wasn't on tour, Leverty and Foster would visit rock clubs, and it was at one of these clubs where they caught sight of a band called Maxx Warrior. Singing for the band was C. J. Snare, and the band's bassist was Perry Richardson. Leverty and Foster were impressed with Snare's vocal ability, and became determined to unite the bands. As soon as Maxx Warrior broke up, Leverty sent Snare some of his songs and asked him to sing on his tape. Foster and Leverty were again impressed, so they brought Snare <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> the band's lead singer for a show in Virginia several weeks later.|$|E
25|$|Alison is {{increasingly}} worried about Ben's lack {{of responsibility and}} commitment, and has doubts about the longevity of their relationship. These thoughts are due to her sister's unhappy marriage. Debbie's husband, Pete (Paul Rudd), works as a talent scout for rock bands, but he leaves at odd hours in the night, which makes her suspect he is having an affair. Upon investigating, she learns that he is actually part of a fantasy baseball draft, which he explains he participates <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> free from Debbie's controlling manner. This results in their separation, and when Ben expresses amusement at Pete's deception, it leads to a heated argument with Alison as they drive to her doctor. Angered, she ejects him from her car and abandons {{him in the middle}} of a busy street. He tracks her down to her appointment and they both start another argument, leading to their own breakup. Ben and Pete decide to go on a road trip to Las Vegas.|$|E
25|$|Sorey and {{his friends}} then confront Heldalf again, but figure out that {{something}} is amiss as he does not show any intention to kill them immediately, as after failing to provoke Sorey, Heldalf attempts to convince him to join his side: this prompts the party to retreat {{and look for the}} true reason behind his motives before their final confrontation. It is revealed that the Era of Chaos was initiated when the previous Shepherd turned Heldalf, a Rolance military general at a time, into a cursed immortal being by infusing him with the fallen Seraph Maotelus when he refused to provide aid to his village when it was invaded: this filled his life with hatred and turned him into the Lord of Calamity. It was also revealed that two infants from the village, Sorey and Mikleo, were saved and taken <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> raised with the Seraphim. With the truth revealed and understood, the Shepherd and his comrades take on Heldalf once again and defeat him once and for all, turning Heldalf back into his human self and Sorey finally ending his life, giving him the peace he craved. Sorey then merges with Maotelus to expel the malevolence from the world and usher in a new era, where both the Seraphim and humans finally live together peacefully. In a post-credits sequence, a future Mikleo is shown exploring some ruins, and is saved from a fall by a reawakened Sorey.|$|E

25|$|The third {{game of the}} Series {{was delayed}} {{for an hour and}} 31 minutes because of rain. Country music star Tim McGraw, son of Phillies {{reliever}} Tug McGraw, spread his father's ashes on the pitching mound of Citizens Bank Park, prior to the game's start. The Phillies scored {{in the bottom of the}} first inning after Jimmy Rollins led off with a single and eventually scored when Chase Utley grounded out. In the next half inning, Tampa Bay's Carl Crawford doubled, stole third base and scored on a Gabe Gross sacrifice fly to center field. Carlos Ruiz gave the Phillies their second lead of the night when he hit a solo home run in the bottom of the second inning. Starting pitchers Matt Garza and Jamie Moyer pitched six and 6⅓ innings respectively. The 2–1 score remained unchanged until the sixth inning when Chase Utley and Ryan Howard hit the 14th back-to-back home runs in World Series history. Crawford scored his second run of the game in the top of the seventh inning when he was batted in by Gross again. Dioner Navarro continued the rally by scoring on a Jason Bartlett ground out—bringing the score to 4–3. In the top of the eighth inning, B.J. Upton led off with a single, stole second and third, and scored on a throwing error to tie the game. Eric Bruntlett was hit by a pitch leading off the bottom of the ninth, moved to second on a wild pitch and to third on a throwing error. Tampa Bay intentionally walked the next two batters to load the bases, creating a force play at the plate. They then brought the infield in (including right fielder Ben Zobrist who was brought <b>in</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a fifth infielder) hoping to convert any groundball into a force out at home and preventing the game winning run. However, Bruntlett scored the winning run on Ruiz's 45-foot infield single, the first walk-off infield single in World Series history, giving the Phillies a 2–1 lead in the series.|$|E
