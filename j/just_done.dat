5|$|Lois has booked Cheesie Charlie's for Stewie's {{upcoming}} {{first birthday}} party and sends Peter, along with Chris, {{to drop off}} the deposit check at the restaurant. However, once they arrive, they seek {{the opportunity to play}} with all the machines, causing Peter to lose his watch in a claw machine. A little boy wins his watch, which causes Peter to become angry and tries to force the watch off the child. The Manager sees this and asks Peter to leave. But once Peter shows the deposit check, he immediately apologizes and exclaims how they are very excited to host Stewie's birthday party. Peter, angered by how he was treated, states that they won't be celebrating Stewie's party there, which causes a crowd of people to circle around Manager shouting for the reservation. Peter, realizing what he has <b>just</b> <b>done,</b> immediately returns home with a poorly crafted lie in an attempt to evade Lois' aggravation which involves him saying that they are Nazis who torture, kill and kidnap people. He pretends that he's already planned an extravagant party at home so that Lois doesn't have do any work.|$|E

These cases are far beyond the scope of the current article which concentrates on transverse waves (such as most electromagnetic waves in bulk media), however one should be aware of cases where the polarization of a coherent wave cannot be described simply using a Jones vector, as we have <b>just</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{her care}} visits, Charlotte {{talks about her}} {{religious}} beliefs to Ambrose. She believes strongly in all the vengeful parts of the Old Testament, {{but also in the}} forgiveness that comes later. Ambrose, for his part, reveals that his father was thrown out by his mother when he was young, and he only saw him again after his mother died – a possible atonement for his years of estrangement. Arthur's behaviour never improves, and he insults Charlotte for being ugly. Finally, on the third evening, Charlotte promises Arthur something he won't forget, and enters his room wearing a skimpy outfit looking mischievous. But as she leaves, she looks uneasy about what she has <b>just</b> <b>done.</b>|$|E

25|$|Clement Greenberg {{included}} {{the work of}} both Morris Louis and Kenneth Noland in a show that he did at the Kootz Gallery in the early 1950s. Clem {{was the first to}} see their potential. He invited them up to New York in 1953, I think it was, to Helen's studio to see a painting that she had <b>just</b> <b>done</b> called Mountains and Sea, a very, very beautiful painting, which was in a sense, out of Pollock and out of Gorky. It also {{was one of the first}} stain pictures, one of the first large field pictures in which the stain technique was used, perhaps the first one. Louis and Noland saw the picture unrolled on the floor of her studio and went back to Washington, DC., and worked together for a while, working at the implications of this kind of painting.|$|E

Murphy explained that Will's seduction of Sue in [...] "Funk" [...] is an attempt to get her to leave the Glee club alone, expanding: [...] "I think he's <b>just</b> <b>done</b> getting pushed around by Sue, but they had great fun with that." ...|$|E

So we wanted to write [...] "Behind" [...] with her from the beginning, but we were in different places. She had just won [...] "American Idol" [...] and was on tour, so she'd e-mail me lyrics, and I'd e-mail her my thoughts.|$|E

500|$|The 59th Division {{was rushed}} to Ireland in {{response}} to the Easter Rising of April 1916, where Blackader's new brigade saw its first active service. Following the Rising, many of those believed by the British authorities to be responsible were tried by military courts; ninety were sentenced to death, of whom fifteen were eventually executed. Blackader, as a senior officer, chaired a number of courts-martial, including those of Éamonn Ceannt, Thomas Clarke, Thomas MacDonagh, Patrick Pearse, and Joseph Plunkett, five of the seven signatories to the Proclamation of the Irish Republic. It appears that Blackader found this task difficult; after Pearse's trial, he is reported to have commented that [...] "I have <b>just</b> <b>done</b> one of the hardest tasks I have ever had to do. I have had to condemn to death one of the finest characters I have ever come across. There must be something very wrong in the state of things that makes a man like that a rebel. I don't wonder that his pupils adored him." ...|$|E
500|$|The West Wing episodes {{were written}} close to {{production}} {{and at the}} time of the September 11 attacks Sorkin was writing on episode six of the season ("Gone Quiet"), which originally was to air on Halloween (October 31). The events caused consternation in the writing staff, and the episode had to be entirely rewritten. [...] "I was kind of paralyzed," [...] said Sorkin, [...] "I didn't know what to write". Because of the attacks, air dates were postponed and the already finished [...] "On the Day Before" [...] became the Halloween episode instead. Nevertheless, the episode took on greater relevance to actual, international events than the writers had intended. On August 9, after the actors had <b>just</b> <b>done</b> a cold reading of the episode, they were informed about the Sbarro restaurant suicide bombing, a Jerusalem suicide bombing in which an American was killed. The close similarity to an event in the script came as a shock to the actors. [...] "It was mind-blowing," [...] said Richard Schiff (Toby).|$|E
500|$|A planned film {{adaption}} of Year Zero {{became a}} television project in 2007. Reznor met with various writers and pitched {{the idea to}} television networks. The 2007–08 Writers Guild of America strike affected the pre-production stage. Nevertheless, Reznor commented in 2008 that the project is [...] "still churning along", {{and that he had}} begun working with American film producer Lawrence Bender. In 2010, Reznor started developing the Year Zero miniseries with HBO and BBC Worldwide Productions. Reznor and Bender collaborated with Carnivàle writer Daniel Knauf to create the science fiction epic. When asked about the miniseries during an [...] "Ask Me Anything" [...] session on Reddit on November 13, 2012, Reznor said it was [...] "currently in a holding state" [...] and explained, [...] "We [...] didn't find the right match with a writer, and really have been avoiding doing what we should have done from the beginning: write it ourselves. [...] This project {{means a lot to me}} and will see the light of day in one form or another." [...] In 2017, during an interview promoting new Nine Inch Nails EP Add Violence, Reznor said that [...] "They got so far as hiring a writer for it, but then it fell to shit because we never had the right writer. I should have <b>just</b> <b>done</b> it [...]" ...|$|E

500|$|... "Beside the Dying Fire" [...] {{is seen as}} a {{transitional}} stage for several characters in the series. The transformation of Rick Grimes to a dark character continues in the episode. He has changed from the person who wanted to save Merle Dixon (in Season 1) and find Sophia Peletier (first half of season 2), to the person who is willing to abandon any hope of finding Andrea. Furthermore, Rick yells at his group for being unappreciative of his sacrifices as a leader. This backlash and hostility has been interpreted as a foreshadowing event for future development for The Walking Dead. [...] "Rick is clearly in a much darker place now than he was {{at the start of the}} season," [...] concluded Entertainment Weekly writer Darren Franich. In a similar fashion, Lori Grimes is furious at Rick after he admits that he killed Shane Walsh. According to Kirkman, [...] "it looks pretty clear that he has lost [...] by doing this" [...] at the end of [...] "Beside the Dying Fire." [...] In response to the interactions between Rick and Lori, he opined: [...] "I think he feels that he has sacrificed for this group, and that sacrifice hasn’t really been appreciated. His confession to Lori did not get the reaction that he had hoped. He thought she would be supportive. Instead, she reacts in a particular way that he feels is hatred and disgust. I think that’s really affecting him. Let's not forget: This is taking place hours after he murdered his best friend. So he is still reeling. He’s trying to keep that a secret. He opens his heart to his wife, and it doesn’t go well. So I think that he’s <b>just</b> <b>done</b> with these people. I think he doesn’t want to be the leader. As he says: If they don’t like it, they’re free to leave." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bregman was {{surprised}} {{about some of}} the negative reviews, but stated that some of the same reviewers have since [...] "retracted" [...] their views upon further discussions of the film. A few weeks before the film's premiere, De Palma told the crew not to get their hopes up about the film's reception. He correctly predicted that Pacino, having just won an Oscar, would be criticized; Koepp, having <b>just</b> <b>done</b> Jurassic Park, would [...] "suck"; Penn would be [...] "brilliant" [...] because he had not done anything for a while; and he himself, having not been forgiven for The Bonfire of the Vanities, would not quite be embraced.|$|E

The idea was that the assassin could be remotely triggered, carry out his mission, and then revert to the original persona, who would {{have no memory of}} what he had <b>just</b> <b>done,</b> hence would be immune to interrogation.|$|E
