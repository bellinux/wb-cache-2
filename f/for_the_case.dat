5|$|After {{being told}} that nobody {{was going to be}} charged with Leigh's sexual assault, in 1990 Leigh's mother began a {{campaign}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> to be officially re-investigated. In August 1994, Kerry Carrington sent a 17,000-word document and 300 pages of evidence to the Royal Commission into the New South Wales Police Service, asking <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> to be investigated. The commission was headed by Judge James Roland Wood, though a representative for the commission stated that Wood's involvement in Webster's trial would not affect the outcome of any investigation. In December 1994, a representative for the commission said that after thorough consideration, they would not be investigating the matter.|$|E

Bunk resumes working the vacant house murders, leading to a murder warrant against Partlow for killing Michael's stepfather.|$|E

30|$|We {{compare the}} {{effective}} permeability of the sub-network with {{a portion of}} fractures eliminated from the original fracture network using these criteria. Not all <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> examined above are tested here: <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> with power-law aperture distributions, we examine α =  1.001, 2, and 6; <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> of log-normal aperture distributions, we examine σ =  0.1, 0.2, and 0.6; we also test <b>the</b> <b>cases</b> where <b>the</b> aperture {{is proportional to the}} fracture length.|$|R
5|$|In the 1980s, economists Daniel Khazzoom and Leonard Brookes {{revisited}} the Jevons paradox <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of society's energy use. Brookes, then {{chief economist}} at the UK Atomic Energy Authority, argued that attempts to reduce energy consumption by increasing energy efficiency would simply raise demand for energy in the economy as a whole. Khazzoom focused on the narrower point that the potential for rebound was ignored in mandatory performance standards for domestic appliances being set by the California Energy Commission.|$|E
5|$|The {{insurers}} {{applied to}} the Earl of Mansfield to have the previous verdict set aside and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> to be tried again.

The Solicitor General, John Lee, appeared on behalf of the Zong owners, as he had done previously in the Guildhall trial. Granville Sharp was also in attendance, together with a secretary he had hired to take a written record of the proceedings.|$|E
