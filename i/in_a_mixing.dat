25|$|To {{meet all}} of their {{nutritional}} requirements cows must eat their entire ration. Unfortunately, much like humans, cattle have their favorite foods. To keep cattle from selectively eating the most desirable parts of the diet, most produces feed a total mixed ration (TMR). In this system all {{the components of the}} feed are well mixed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> truck before being delivered to the cattle. Different TMRs are often prepared for groups of cows with different nutritional requirements.|$|E
25|$|Before any procedures, the oreo {{cookies are}} frozen for 3 hours {{and the oil}} is {{preheated}} to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. After that, the buttermilk pancake mix is stirred with the water <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> bowl. The oreo cookies are dipped in the mixture, making sure the oreo is fully covered with the batter. The coated oreo cookies are then dropped into hot oil until the cookies turn golden brown. The cookies are removed from the oil and placed on a sheet pan with paper towels for draining the excessive oil. In the meantime, {{the tops of the}} fried oreos are dusted with confectioners sugar.|$|E
25|$|To {{limit the}} {{environmental}} impact of returning the brine to the ocean, it can be diluted with another stream of water entering the ocean, such as the outfall of a wastewater treatment or power plant. With medium to large power plant and desalination plants, the power plant's cooling water flow is likely to be several times larger than that of the desalination plant, reducing the salinity of the combination. Another method to dilute the brine is to mix it via a diffuser <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> zone. For example, once a pipeline containing the brine reaches the sea floor, it can split into many branches, each releasing brine gradually through small holes along its length. Mixing can be combined with power plant or wastewater plant dilution.|$|E

50|$|Another {{example is}} a {{dilution}} refrigerator, where a mixture of 3He and 4He forms a phase boundary <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>mixing</b> chamber and can cool down to a few millikelvins. Dilution refrigerators typically use a 1-K pot to condense the 3He/4He mixture.|$|E
