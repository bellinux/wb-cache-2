5000|$|The US Generally Accepted Accounting Principles {{also include}} {{instruction}} on accounting for derivatives. For the most part, {{the rules are}} similar to those given under IFRS. The standards that include these guidelines are SFAS 133 and 138. SFAS 133, written in 1998, stated that a “recognized asset or liability that may give rise to a foreign currency transaction gain or loss under Statement 52 (such as a foreign-currency-denominated receivable or payable) not be the hedged item in a foreign currency fair value or cash flow hedge”. [...] Based on the language used in the statement, this was done because the FASB felt that the assets and liabilities listed on a company’s books should reflect their historic cost value, rather than being adjusted for fair value. The use of a hedge would cause them to be revalued as such. Remember that the value of the hedge is derived from the value of the underlying asset. The amount recorded at payment or reception would differ from the value of the derivative recorded under SFAS 133.As illustrated above in the example, this difference between the hedge value and the asset or liability value can be effectively accounted for by using either a cash flow or a fair value hedge. Thus, two years later FASB issued SFAS 138 which amended SFAS 133 and allowed both cash flow and <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> <b>hedges</b> for foreign exchanges. Citing the reasons given previously, SFAS 138 required the recording of derivative assets at fair value based on the prevailing spot rate.|$|E
40|$|Statement of Financial Accounting Standard No. 133 induces time value-related {{earnings}} variability for purchased options held {{to hedge}} maturity. In response to management's reluctance to report such volatility, for certain cash flow hedges, the Derivatives Implementation Group (DIG) condoned relegating volatility to "Other Comprehensive Income" (OCI), {{where it does}} not affect firms' reported earnings per share. However, the DIG solution only applies to certain cash flow hedges. Most importantly, ephemeral volatility still persists for <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> <b>hedges...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background and problem: Financial {{instruments}} are often highly complex. An effective financial {{presentation of the}} certain risks is therefore vital for the users’, especially for the investors’ understanding of financial reports for their decision-making processes. This is of special importance {{when it comes to}} hedge accounting and an understanding of the companies’ risk management policies, and how hedging affects the entities’ financial performances and risk situations. IASBs answer to this issue was the introduction of the IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosure, an accounting standard with the main goal {{to improve the quality of}} disclosed information, compulsory for all annual reports from 1 st January 2007 onwards. Purpose: The purpose of this thesis is to explore how Swedish Large Cap entities have disclosed information regarding hedge accounting in their annual reports 2007, after the implementation of IFRS 7. Furthermore this thesis evaluates how the new hedge accounting disclosure requirements are perceived by the financial analysts. Delimitations: The thesis will only focus on that part which is presented in IFRS 7 regarding hegde accounting. The purpose is not to investigate how the companies use hedges, nor the quality of the disclosed information. Moreover, the thesis will only focus on the user’s perspective (investor). Method: A mix between a quantitive and qualitative method have been chosen in order to fulfill the purpose of the thesis. The quantitive method was used by conducting a disclosure study. The secondary data was collected from annual reports 2007. With a qualitative method, primary data was gathered from two telephone interviews with financial analysts and one accounting specialist. Conclusion: The findings and the analysis point out that for <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> <b>hedges</b> approximately 88 percent of the entities’ disclosure information correlated with IFRS 7 hedge accounting requirements. For cash flow hedges and hedges of net investments in foreign operations approximately 63 respective 81 percent of the entities provided information correlating with the requirements Even though, different correlations regarding the standard’s requirements and the information disclosed were identified, the interviewed financial analysts did not perceive those inconsistencies as important issues for their daily work, since hedge accounting disclosure were not considered as vital information sources. Suggestion on further research: It would have been interesting to conduct the same study for financial institutions since hedge accounting is more vital for their business. Furthermore, it would also be useful to evaluate the quality of the disclosed information, besides the quantitative aspects we have tested...|$|E

5000|$|Notice how in year 2 {{when the}} payable is paid off, {{the amount of}} cash paid {{is equal to the}} forward rate of {{exchange}} back in year 1. Any change in the forward rate, however, changes the value of the forward contract. In this example, the exchange rate climbed in both years, increasing the value of the forward contract. Since the derivative instruments are required to be recorded at <b>fair</b> <b>value,</b> these adjustments must be made to the forward contract listed on the books. The offsetting account is other comprehensive income. This process allows the gain and loss on the position to be shown in Net income. The second is a <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> <b>hedge.</b> Again, according to IAS 39 this is “a hedge of the exposure to changes in <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> of a recognized asset or liability or an unrecognized firm commitment, or an identified portion of such an asset, liability or firm commitment, that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect profit or loss”. [...] More simply, this type of hedge would eliminate the <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> risk of assets and liabilities reported on the Balance sheet.

40|$|Inquiries {{about this}} {{document}} {{can be made}} to HARC@hawaii. edu This article provides students with a tutorial to learn accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities on foreign currency transactions. It can be used in courses that discuss derivative instruments, such as advanced accounting, international accounting, or in a company’s training program. The tutorial helps students develop critical thinking skills in analyzing the impact of different hedging strategies on a firm’s financial statements. The included scenario demonstrates how a US importer uses foreign currency derivatives (forward contract vs. option) to hedge exchange rate fluctuations of a liability (foreign-currency-denominated accounts payable). This situation is applied across five cases to provide a comparative analysis of the reporting results from the use of different accounting treatments (<b>fair</b> <b>value</b> <b>hedge</b> vs. cash flow hedge) for the two derivatives. The base case, Case 0, demonstrates the impact of not using a derivative to mitigate market risk. Cases 1 and 2 demonstrate the application of a <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> <b>hedge</b> in using a forward contract vs. option. Cases 3 and 4 illustrate a cash flow hedge. The tutorial scenario begins with foreign currency appreciation. To ensure learning on the tutorial, a student project is provided in Appendix A when the exchange rates are expected to be volatile. Students are further asked to write a memo to recommend a hedging strategy after technical analysis. By completing the project, students learn to apply critical thinking and communication skills, in addition to gaining technical accounting knowledge.

I use new derivative disclosures required by SFAS 161 to collect detailed information about firms’ use of derivatives.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} utilizes empirical {{methods to}} shed light on the current debate over whether to adopt <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting for loans held for long term. Proponents of <b>fair</b> <b>valuing</b> loans argue that reporting loans at their <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> enhances the overall transparency of financial reporting. In contrast, opponents are against applying <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting to loans because <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> cannot be measured reliably in the case of loans held for long term. Therefore, the key question here is whether loan <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> are sufficiently reliable to provide more relevant and transparent information compared to traditional measurements of loans. To explore this, I compare <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> disclosures of loans under Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 107 (SFAS 107), Disclosures about <b>Fair</b> <b>Value</b> of Financial Instruments, with traditional measurements of loans reported on balance sheets. More specifically, this study asks two research questions; (i) whether loan <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> provide more relevant information about future loan losses compared to traditional measurements of loans and (ii) whether banks intentionally manage their <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> estimates of loans when they are financially distressed. SFAS 107 mandates the disclosure of <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> for financial instruments with the objective of providing investors with more relevant information about firms' future cash flows. However, the results show that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurements of loans explained variation in future loan losses, which capture cash flows from loans, less than traditional cost-based measurements of loans. In addition, I find evidence suggesting that financially distressed banks overstated the <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of their loan portfolios and that <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of loans in the aggregate lagged considerably behind the market values of loans during the recent credit crisis. Overall, my results suggest that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> disclosures in bank loan portfolios contain relatively less information about future cash flows because they are measured unreliably and they suffer from a similar lack of timeliness as reported carrying values...|$|R

To clarify the applied accounting methods for PPE and investment property I read each company's accounting policies for these asset groups in its annual report. <b>Fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting's effect on asset values is studied by comparing different financial ratios between historical cost companies and <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> companies. The choice to apply <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting to PPE and investment property is examined by applying a logistic regression analysis. In line with previous evidence, historical cost accounting is the dominant accounting method. However, I find more support for <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting for PPE than previous studies. On the other hand, <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting for investment property is slightly less popular than results from earlier studies would suggest. The results indicate that <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> accounting has a significant impact on asset <b>values.</b> <b>Fair</b> <b>value</b> companies have clearly higher book-to-market ratios and lower return on assets (ROA). When examining the choice to apply <b>fair</b> <b>value,</b> I find that companies operating in the real estate industry are more likely to apply <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> to investment property. As for PPE, there are two factors that explain the choice to apply <b>fair</b> <b>value.</b> First, companies that measure investment property at <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> are more likely to apply <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> to PPE as well. Second, PPE-heavy firms are more likely to measure PPE at <b>fair</b> <b>value...</b>|$|R
40|$|This study {{examines}} how investors perceive <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> {{gains and losses}} arising from {{the adoption of the}} standard Statement of Financial Accounting Standards No. 159 The <b>Fair</b> <b>Value</b> Option for Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (hereafter FAS 159). We find that there is a positive correspondence between a firm’s stock returns and FAS 159 gains and losses attributable to <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> changes in assets. However, we do not observe a similar relation for gains and losses arising from <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> changes in liabilities. The results provide support that there are different valuation implications from <b>fair</b> <b>valuing</b> liabilities as opposed to <b>fair</b> <b>valuing</b> assets. Specifically, investors may perceive the <b>value</b> implications of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> changes from liabilities as less economically viable than those arising from changes in the <b>fair</b> <b>values</b> of assets. Further analyses provide support that FAS 159 gains and losses enable investors to better assess the underlying economic risk of the firm...|$|R
40|$|Many {{have argued}} that {{measuring}} financial instruments at <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> might not reflect firms’ financial condition. Prior study finds that managers manipulate the “disclosure” of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurement (Song et al. 2010). In this study, we attempt to provide evidence regarding manager’s incentive to manipulate the disclosure of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurements by examining whether the disclosure of less relevant <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurement {{is related to the}} odds of earnings management. We find that firms with more Level 3 assets and liabilities (i. e., less <b>value</b> relevant <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurement) are more likely to recognize positive unrealized gains to meet or beat analyst forecast target. In addition, we find that only firms with weak corporate governance disclose more Level 3 <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> liabilities and recognize unrealized gains into reported earnings to meet or beat analyst forecast target. This evidence suggests that managers manipulate the disclosure of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> measurement in order to manage reported earnings via the adoption of <b>fair</b> <b>value</b> option. ...|$|R
