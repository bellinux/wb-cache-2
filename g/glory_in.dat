5|$|Chamberlain saw his {{elevation}} to the premiership as {{the final}} <b>glory</b> <b>in</b> {{a career as a}} domestic reformer, not realising that he would be remembered for foreign policy decisions. One reason he sought the settlement of European issues was the hope it would allow him to concentrate on domestic affairs.|$|E
5|$|After this feat {{that earned}} him fame and <b>glory,</b> <b>in</b> 1262 Alexios was {{appointed}} again to lead an army against Epirus. Here, however, he was defeated and captured by Nikephoros Doukas, who {{sent him to}} Manfred in Italy. He was ransomed in 1265 in exchange for Constance II of Hohenstaufen, widow of John Vatatzes. He is last mentioned in a document from December 1270 in which he made a donation to the Makrinitissa Monastery near Volos, and died sometime between 1271 and 1275, probably at Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, {{he joined}} Sunderland, but was linked with a {{move away from}} the club because of alleged {{timekeeping}} issues. He joined Queens Park Rangers in January 2009 and was released {{at the end of the}} 2008–09 season. Miller joined Hibernian at the start of the 2009–10 Scottish Premier League season on a free transfer. He moved to Australian A-League club Perth <b>Glory</b> <b>in</b> 2011 after his contract with Hibernian expired. Miller represents the Republic of Ireland team internationally, making his debut in 2004 against the Czech Republic.|$|E

5|$|In Smith's view, the {{opportunity}} to achieve exaltation extended to all humanity; those who died with no opportunity to accept saving ordinances could achieve exaltation by accepting them in the afterlife through ordinances performed on their behalf. Smith said that children who died in their innocence would be guaranteed to rise at the resurrection and receive exaltation. Apart from those who committed the eternal sin, Smith taught that even the wicked and disbelieving would achieve a degree of <b>glory</b> <b>in</b> the afterlife.|$|E
5|$|The 2011–12 {{season was}} {{similarly}} successful, as the club won the premiership {{for the second}} time in its history with 51 points, two more than second-place Brisbane. The club failed to qualify for a second successive Grand Final, though, losing 5–2 on aggregate to Brisbane in the major semi-final and 5–3 on penalties after a 1–1 draw with Perth <b>Glory</b> <b>in</b> the Grand Final Qualifier.|$|E

They played shows in the US, Europe, Japan and Australia before Geffen Records pulled their financial support for the tour, with Slash returning to Guns N' Roses and Slash's Snakepit disbanding.|$|E

5|$|Another account {{recalled}} how Marseille once ignored {{an order to}} turn back from a fight when outnumbered by two to one, but seeing an Allied aircraft closing on his wing leader, Marseille broke formation and shot the attacking aircraft down. Expecting congratulations when he landed, his commander was critical of his actions, receiving three days of confinement for failing to carry out an order. Days later, Marseille was passed over for promotion and was now the sole Fähnrich in the Geschwader. This was a humiliation for him, suspecting that his abilities were being suppressed so the squadron leaders could take all the <b>glory</b> <b>in</b> the air.|$|E
5|$|Deighton {{authored}} two television scripts, {{the first}} of which was Long Past <b>Glory</b> <b>in</b> 1963; he also wrote a film script, Oh! What a Lovely War (1969). His long-held interest in cooking—his mother had been a professional chef and instilled a love for cuisine in her son—led to an illustrated cookery column in the Sunday newspaper, The Observer, for two years. The work was collected into two later books, Len Deighton's Action Cookbook and Où est le garlic (both 1965); he subsequently wrote several other cookery books. Deighton has produced several other works of non-fiction, including a study of the assassination of John F. Kennedy, a history of the airship, Second World War military history and a short e-book about James Bond.|$|E

On January 9, 2011, at TNA's {{pay-per-view}} Genesis, Matt made his TNA debut as a surprise member of the Immortal faction, and defeated Rob Van Dam. Jeff, who was also a member of Immortal, went on to lose the TNA World Heavyweight Championship to Mr. Anderson later that night. On the January 13 episode of Impact! the Hardy Brothers reunited, as heels for the first time since 1999, and defeated Van Dam and Anderson. Following the Victory Road pay-per-view, Immortal severed their ties with Jeff. On August 20, Matt was released from TNA after being arrested for driving while intoxicated.|$|E

5|$|Meredith had to {{deal with}} {{extremely}} physical defences, and was often boxed into the corner of the pitch by as many as four players. As his talents became widely regarded, more well organised defences would designate him with a man-marker, to try and isolate him from his teammates. This often left him reliant on an unselfish inside-right partner willing to fetch and carry the ball for him without expecting much in terms of goals or <b>glory</b> <b>in</b> return. A hard-working wing-half would also improve Meredith's effectiveness by winning the ball and sending him a pass down the flank. The best teams he played in also had a centre-forward able {{to make the most of}} his accurate crosses.|$|E
5|$|The TNA X Division Championship {{was also}} defended at Turning Point, with then-champion A.J. Styles facing Samoa Joe. This rivalry started at TNA's Sacrifice PPV event held on August14, 2005, where Joe {{defeated}} Styles {{in the final}} round of the 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament. By winning the tournament, Joe was entitled to a TNA X Division Championship match against then-champion Christopher Daniels. Daniels had interfered in the match, leading to Joe's victory. As a result, Styles was added to Joe's title match with Daniels, making it a Three Way match at TNA's Unbreakable PPV event held on September11, 2005. Styles won the bout at Unbreakable becoming the new champion, thus leading to a defense against Daniels at Bound for <b>Glory</b> <b>in</b> a Thirty-Minute Iron Man match which Styles also won.|$|E
5|$|The club {{won their}} first Championship in 1944. The {{powerhouse}} of Swedish football in recent years, Malmö FF also saw <b>glory</b> <b>in</b> the 1970s, winning five Swedish championships and four Svenska Cupen titles. What is more, MFF {{is the only}} Northern European club to have reached {{the final of the}} European Cup, the predecessor of the UEFA Champions League. They were runners-up in the 1979 European Champions Cup final, which they lost 1–0 to English club Nottingham Forest. For this feat, Malmö FF were awarded the Svenska Dagbladet Gold Medal. Malmö FF are the leaders of the overall Allsvenskan table maratontabellen. In more recent history the team qualified for two consecutive group stages of the Champions League in 2014 and 2015.|$|E

5|$|When the War of the Austrian Succession started, Winterfeldt {{was sent}} {{on a mission}} to St. Petersburg, which, however, failed. He then {{commanded}} a grenadier battalion with great distinction at the Battle of Mollwitz, and won further <b>glory</b> <b>in</b> the celebrated minor combat of Rothschloss, where the Prussian hussars defeated the Austrians on 17 May 1741. One month later, Winterfeldt was made a colonel, as also was Zieten, the cavalry leader who had actually commanded at Rothschloss; the latter, as the older in years and service, resented the rapid promotion of his junior. After this promotion, Frederick chiefly employed Winterfeldt as a confidential staff officer to represent his views to the generals, a position in which Winterfeldt needed extraordinary tact and knowledge of men and affairs, {{and as a matter of}} course made many enemies.|$|E
5|$|After Caesar's assassination, Mark Antony, who {{had been}} Caesar's Master of the Horse, formed an {{alliance}} with Caesar's adopted son and great-nephew, Gaius Octavian. Along with Marcus Aemilius Lepidus, they formed an alliance known as the Second Triumvirate. They held powers that were nearly identical to the powers that Caesar had held under his constitution, and as such, the senate and assemblies remained powerless. The conspirators were defeated at the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. Lepidus became powerless, and Antony went to Egypt to seek <b>glory</b> <b>in</b> the east, while Octavian remained in Rome. Eventually, however, Antony and Octavian fought {{against each other in}} one last battle. Antony was defeated in the naval Battle of Actium in 31 BC, and committed suicide in 30 BC. In 29 BC, Octavian returned to Rome, as the unchallenged master of the state. In 27 BC, Octavian offered to give up the Dictatorial powers which he had held since 42 BC, but the senate refused, and thus ratified his status as master of the state. He became the first Roman Emperor, Augustus, and the transition from Roman Republic to Roman Empire was complete.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} of Paths of <b>Glory</b> <b>in</b> Munich in early 1957, Kubrick met and romanced the German actress Christiane Harlan, who played a small though memorable role in the film. Kubrick married Harlan in 1958, and the couple remained together 40 years, {{until his death in}} 1999. Besides his stepdaughter, they had two daughters together: Anya Renata (April 6, 1959 – July 7, 2009) and Vivian Vanessa (born August 5, 1960). In 1959 they settled into a home at 316 South Camden Drive in Beverly Hills with Harlan's daughter, Katherina, aged six. They also lived in New York, during which time Christiane studied art at the Art Students League of New York, later becoming an independent artist. The couple moved to the United Kingdom in 1961 to make Lolita, and Kubrick hired Peter Sellers to star in his next film, Dr. Strangelove, Sellers was unable to leave the UK, so Kubrick made Britain his permanent home thereafter. The move was quite convenient to Kubrick, since he shunned the Hollywood system and its publicity machine, and he and Christiane had become alarmed with the increase in violence in New York.|$|E

5|$|Early {{into the}} 2011–12 A-League season he was {{deployed}} as the focal of a midfield diamond, and this {{contributed to the}} team's improving form. McBreen scored his first goal {{of the season in}} a 3–1 home win over Melbourne Heart, with an 82nd-minute penalty kick, and his only A-League goal scored in normal play came after converting Pedj Bojić's cross in a 3–2 home victory over Adelaide United on 21 January 2012. The Mariners became the A-League Premiers after finishing in first place in the 2011–12 table, also qualifying for the finals series. He appeared as a substitute in the first leg of their 5–2 aggregate defeat to Brisbane Roar in the major semi-final, and as a substitute in the preliminary final against Perth <b>Glory,</b> <b>in</b> which the Mariners were beaten 5–3 in a penalty shoot-out after a 1–1 extra time draw. McBreen made five appearances and scored twice in the 2012 AFC Champions League, as they were eliminated from the tournament after finishing third in their group. He scored four goals from 30 matches in 2011–12, and was handed a new contract with the Mariners for the 2012–13 A-League in April 2012.|$|E
5|$|In the mid-1920s Nick Prata (as he {{was then}} known) began working in the film industry, doing odd jobs around the set for Fox Film, such as prop boy, script clerk, and {{assistant}} cameraman. While working as an assistant on Raoul Walsh's What Price <b>Glory?</b> <b>in</b> 1926, Prata was given a screen test, after which his name was changed to Nick Stuart. Shortly after, he became Howard Hawks's personal assistant. He appeared in minor roles in two film shorts, before being {{given an opportunity to}} act in a featured role by Hawks, in 1927's, The Cradle Snatchers. After the success of The Cradle Snatchers, Stuart would star in several shorts, many of which again paired him with his Snatchers co-star, Sally Phipps, which included Gentlemen Prefer Scotch, and Cupid and the Clock (based on a short story by O. Henry). The two would star in Stuart's next three films in 1927 and 1928: High School Hero, Why Sailors Go Wrong, and News Parade. Stuart's next role was that of Sandy, starring alongside Victor McLaglen in William K. Howard's The River Pirate in 1928. Stuart and Sue Carol had been linked together romantically since early in 1928, and would co-star in Stuart's next project, Girls Gone Wild.|$|E
5|$|The Mariners' inaugural {{season was}} {{considered}} a resounding success by most; the team reached the 2006 A-League Grand Final after finishing third during the regular season. Central Coast was defeated by Sydney FC 1–0 {{in front of a}} crowd of 41,689—a competition record at the time. The Mariners also won the 2005 Pre-Season Cup, defeating Perth <b>Glory</b> <b>in</b> the final 1–0. Before the 2006–07 A-League season, the Mariners secured the services of then-Australian international Tony Vidmar from NAC Breda for two years. This was the club's first marquee signing, following the lead of Sydney FC (Dwight Yorke) and Adelaide United (Qu Shengqing). Central Coast again reached the grand final in the 2006 Pre-Season Cup, losing to Adelaide United 5–4 on penalties after the score was tied 1–1 after extra time. The Mariners then participated in the 2006–07 A-League season, but was unable to gain a spot in the final series, finishing sixth after the regular season.|$|E
