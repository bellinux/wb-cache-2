5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from {{psychological and social}} factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>abuse</b> may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. <b>Drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> <b>abuse</b> increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.|$|E
