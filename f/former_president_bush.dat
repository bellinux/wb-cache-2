25|$|Shortly {{before the}} end of President Bush's second term, newsmedia in other {{countries}} started opining that under the United Nations Convention Against Torture, the United States is obligated to hold those responsible for prisoner abuse to account under criminal law. One proponent of this view was the United Nations Special Rapporteur on torture and other cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment or punishment (Professor Manfred Nowak) who, on January 20, 2009, remarked on German television that former president George W. Bush had lost his head of state immunity and under international law, the United States would now be mandated to start criminal proceedings against all those involved in these violations of the UN Convention Against Torture.

500|$|On January 7, Trump {{appeared}} in Brooklyn Park, Minnesota, where he spoke before the Chamber of Commerce, attended a Reform Party fundraiser, {{and held a}} joint press conference with Ventura. [...] At the fundraiser, Trump identified North Korea as the nation's greatest foreign policy threat, blasted Japan for [...] "ripping us off" [...] for the last 25 years, and ripped Russia as being [...] "totally mixed up" [...] for placing [...] "people nobody ever even heard of" [...] in charge of missiles. At the press conference, Trump claimed {{he had yet to}} decide whether to run officially and so had not asked for Ventura's endorsement. [...] Ventura said that if Trump decided to run, he would give his [...] "full consideration." [...] Trump asserted it would be [...] "disaster for the Reform Party" [...] if Pat Buchanan received the presidential nomination. Describing himself and Ventura as self-made and not part of the [...] "lucky sperm club," [...] Trump made an indirect jab at both the Republican front-runner George W. Bush, the son of <b>former</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush,</b> and Democratic front-runner Al Gore, son of the late Senator Albert Gore, Sr.. Trump and Ventura released a written statement opposing the Commission on Presidential Debates' decision to limit debate participation to candidates polling above 15 percent in the general election and urging the Federal Election Commission to take action.|$|E

2500|$|In the Persian Gulf area, Iraq {{remained}} a problem. In June 1993 two U.S. Navy ships fired Tomahawk missiles against the headquarters building of Iraq's intelligence service in Baghdad {{in response to}} evidence of a plot to assassinate <b>former</b> <b>President</b> <b>Bush</b> {{during a visit to}} Kuwait. Aspin described the attack as a [...] "wake up call" [...] for Saddam Hussein. Two months later Aspin received a report on the U.S. military performance during the 1991 Gulf War, the result of a study undertaken by the House Armed Services Committee when he chaired it. The report concluded that the U.S. Central Command had greatly exaggerated damage done to Iraqi military equipment, such as tanks and naval vessels, by air strikes. Aspin also had to consider the question of health problems of U.S. service personnel who participated in the action against Iraq. He announced that a preliminary review disclosed no connection between chemical weapon agents and the reported health problems. Nevertheless, he formed a panel of outside experts to examine the issue further.|$|E
2500|$|On January 4, 2012, Chris Kyle, {{a former}} U.S. Navy SEAL, {{promoted}} his recently released book American Sniper on the Opie and Anthony Show. When Kyle {{was on the}} Opie and Anthony Show, a listener called in and asked about how Kyle allegedly punched Ventura in a bar fight. Show host Gregg 'Opie' Hughes asked Kyle about the rumor. Kyle claimed that he punched Ventura in the face at a bar in Coronado, California which was popular with Navy SEAL personnel. According to Kyle, he did this because Ventura loudly expressed criticism of the Iraq War back in 2006 during a wake for Michael A. Monsoor, a Navy SEAL {{who had been killed}} in action in Iraq the same year, and who would posthumously receive the Medal of Honor in 2008. Kyle indicated that Ventura, who was present in San Diego to give a speech to a graduating BUD/S class, was [...] "letting it be known he did not agree" [...] with the war in Iraq, and was [...] "bad-mouthing the war, bad-mouthing (<b>former</b> <b>President)</b> <b>Bush,</b> bad-mouthing America." ...|$|E

50|$|The {{threat of}} vouchers, {{wavering}} support for public education, and bipartisan support for charters {{has led some}} unions to start charters themselves.
