40|$|<b>Economic</b> <b>lot</b> <b>sizing</b> and {{batching}} models often assume reliable manufacturing facilities. In this research, {{we focus}} on the effects of machine breakdowns and corrective maintenance on the <b>economic</b> <b>lot</b> <b>sizing</b> decisions. Two production control policies are proposed for coping with these stochastic interferences. The first policy assumes that production of the interrupted lots is not resumed after a breakdown. Instead, the on-hand inventory is depleted before a new cycle is initiated. Under the second policy studied here, production is immediately resumed after a breakdown, if the current on-hand inventory is below a certain threshold level. It is shown that this control structure is optimal among all stationary policies. We show that under both policies the optimal <b>lot</b> <b>sizes</b> will always be bigger than the ones in a corresponding deterministic case, and that the optimal <b>lot</b> <b>size</b> increases with the failure rate.

40|$|Joint <b>economic</b> <b>lot</b> <b>size</b> {{models for}} purchasers and vendors are more {{economical}} than when considering their inventory problems independently. It requires vendors {{to have a}} complete knowledge of their purchaser's demands. In such a situation, the vendor shall manage the supply with comparatively more inventory at its end. The operational cost can further decrease provided supply is in sub-batches and logistics cost does not increase substantially. However, determining the right size for these sub-batches becomes an issue. Sub-batches of varying size may cause planning and control problems, but supply in sub-batches of uniform size will not. In this paper, joint <b>economic</b> <b>lot</b> <b>size</b> models are presented for the two supply situations, namely staggered supply and uniform supply. Cases are employed that describe the inventory situation of a single vendor supplying an item to a manufacturer that is further processed before it is supplied to the end-user.

40|$|Abstract — Considerable {{attention}} {{to coordinate the}} system between buyer and vendor has become an interesting issue to efficiently increase the performance of supply chain activities. Joint <b>economic</b> <b>lot</b> <b>size</b> model (JELS) has been introduced by many researchers as the spirit of coordinating the flow of material from the vendor to its downstream. As an inventory replenishment technique, JELS model is centered on reducing joint total cost of vendor and buyer by simultaneously deciding optimal delivery lot size, number of deliveries, and batch production lot. It is appropriate {{to take into account}} transportation costs as the function shipping weight and distance since delivery lot size has interrelated with shipping weight. Hence, this study constitutes an effort to develop the model of JELS by incorporating transportation cost. The solution procedure of the model is developed for solving two problems which are incapacitated and capacitated model. In addition, numerical examples were provided to illustrate the feasibility of the solution procedure in deriving optimal solution. The result presents central decision making which is useful for coordination and collaboration between vendor and buyer. Index Terms—Supply chain, Joint <b>economic</b> <b>lot</b> <b>size...</b>|$|E

Moreover, the unit production cost is a stochastic variable, which is evolved according to a continuous-time Markov process over the planning horizon. The model is formulated as a stochastic dynamic programming (DP) optimization with the state variable being unit production cost. Then, it is solved using the backward dynamic programming approach.

40|$|Single capacitated {{production}} facilities where multiple products are produced pose particularly challenging scheduling problems. The traditional <b>economic</b> <b>lot</b> <b>size</b> calculation reflects the optimum production batch {{size in the}} light of the tradeoff between inventory carrying costs and order preparation/setup costs. However, these calculations are straightforward only when applied to a single product. When multiple products are produced on the same facility, the production quantities must be translated into a schedule which is within the capacity of the facility and results in the timely satisfaction of demand for each product. Previously published solution procedures directly address the capacity issue. A far less tractable issue is the stockout concern. This issue has previously been addressed by either (1) imposing (often overly restrictive) constraints a priori to guarantee feasibility from the outset possibly eliminating more economic schedule alternatives from consideration or (2) heuristic enumeration procedures where trial solutions are evaluated for feasibility a posteriori but the escape from infeasibility often poses algorithmic difficulties. In this paper, the focus is on providing a workable production sequence through a posteriori tests. Mathematical programming approaches are defined which include alternative formulations to better address the stockout concern. Goal programming procedures are proposed which provide a mechanism to directly examine the tradeoffs between scheduling efficiency and delivery performance. <b>economic</b> <b>lot</b> <b>size,</b> math programming, goal programming, capacity and stockout constraints...|$|E
