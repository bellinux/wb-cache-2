GWSS adults are allowed to lay eggs on cotton plants in cages. The leaves containing the eggs are excised from the plant and the petiole placed in a vial containing a known concentration of insecticide. The uptake of insecticide into the leaves is quantified gravimetrically, and then the progress of nymph development is monitored until emergence (timed according to nymph development on control leaves without pesticide pressure). The development of eggs is determined for different pesticide concentrations, so that a dose-mortality line can be developed (as for imidacloprid).

Insecticide residues were measured in leaves sampled from the treated plants at four time intervals after treatment to determine the relationship between insecticide concentration and efficacy against two insect pests: sweetpotato whitefly, Bemisia tabaci Gennadius, and the citrus mealybug, Planococcus citri Risso. The insecticides were evaluated at their respective label rate and at the comparable label rate of the other insecticide under two different light environments: ambient and shade. The uptake of <b>dinotefuran</b> into yellow sage was more rapid at both treatment rates than both rates of imidacloprid, resulting in higher percent mortality of whitefly nymphs (89. 8 – 100) compared with imidacloprid (14. 1 – 89. 2) across all 4 wk. Additionally, plants that received both rates of <b>dinotefuran</b> had fewer whitefly pupae (< 1. 0) at week 4 compared with imidacloprid-treated plants (23. 7 – 25. 3).

Eight colonies consisting of about ten-thousand honeybees in each colony were investigated under the practical beekeeping conditions in our apiary. In this study foods containing <b>dinotefuran</b> of 1 ppm to 10 ppm or clothianidin of 0. 4 ppm to 4 ppm were fed into a beehive. Three levels of concentration were 10 （ high-conc. ）, 50 （ middle-conc. ） and 100 （low-conc. ） times lower than that in practical use.

40|$|International audienceThe {{toxicity}} and biochemical {{changes in}} honey bees (Apis mellifera) treated with four insecticides—acetamiprid, <b>dinotefuran,</b> pymetrozine, and pyridalyl—were evaluated under controlled laboratory conditions. Foraging bees {{were exposed to}} different dosages of tested insecticides by oral feeding at different dosages recommended by the manufacturers for agricultural crops in Egypt (0. 01 -, 0. 02 -, 0. 04 -, 0. 1 -, and onefold). Moreover, the acute toxicity of these insecticides was evaluated by topical application on the thorax of foragers to calculate the LD 50 values. The specific activities of acetylcholinesterase (AChE), carboxylesterase, glutathione S-transferase (GST), and polyphenol oxidase (PPO) were measured in different tissues of surviving foragers after 24  h of treatment to explore the possible mode of action of insecticides and honey bees' strategies for detoxification and tolerance. The results indicated that regardless of how the bees were exposed to insecticides, <b>dinotefuran</b> was extremely toxic to adult A. mellifera (topical LD 50 = 0. 0006  μg/bee and oral feeding LC 50 = 1. 29  mg/L). Pyridalyl showed moderate toxicity compared to <b>dinotefuran</b> at the recommended application rate; however, acetamiprid and pymetrozine were relatively less toxic to bees (< 25  % mortality at the recommended application rates). Data showed that tested insecticides varied in their influence on AChE, carboxylesterase, GST, and PPO activities that were highly correlated to their toxicity against A. mellifera. The biochemical analysis of carboxylesterase and GST showed that these enzymes detoxified the low doses of acetamiprid, pymetrozine, and pyridalyl, but not <b>dinotefuran.</b> Overall, our results are valuable not only in evaluating the toxicity of common insecticides onto honey bees, but also in highlighting the validity of enzymes activities as proper indicators for exposure to agrochemicals...|$|E

The study was conducted to determine the efficacy of several insecticides against whitefly on chili plant (Capsicum annuum) from 'Kulai' 0630 cultivation in Malaysia. All management procedures are conducted as usual to imitate commercial plantation. The insecticides used in this study are Imidacloprid (Confidor 200 SL) and <b>Dinotefuran</b> (Oshin 20 WP). The effectiveness of each insecticide used being evaluated in term of the number of pest present on the crop plant before and after the application of insecticide. This experiment is conducted by using randomized completely block design (RCBD) with 3 treatments and 4 blocks/replications for each treatment amounting to 12 plot altogether. Each plot will be provided with 10 experimental units. Therefore, the total numbers of experimental units are 120 plants.

Sampling are done on the day prior the treatment, the day after treatment, then on day 3, 7 and 14 after treatment. Treatment are done twice, on day 75 after sowing and day 90 after sowing. The treatments used untreated water as a control. The control plot shown a linear reduction in the whitefly population mean from 5. 5 to 2. 5 for the first treatment. In plot treated with Imidac 1 oprid, the population mean of insect pest drop from 6. 75 to 3 in the first day, and remain the same (1. 75) for the three consecutive data collection day. Plot treated with <b>Dinotefuran</b> show a reduction from 5. 75 before treatment to 3. 75 on the first day and continue to drop in the third day to only 1. 5. However from day 7 it start to rise back to 2. 25 and 2. 75 on the last day. In the second application, the mean number of insect pest also recorded to drop after treatment. In the control plot, insect population mean drop from 3 to 2. 5 after treatment, continue to drop to 2. 25 on the third day but rise up in the seventh day to 2. 75, and 3 on the last day.

For sandflies, the anti-feeding effect was 96. 9, 99. 7, 98. 7, 83. 5 and 87. 0 % on days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28, respectively. The mortality effect was 97. 8, 99. 8, 73. 7, 27. 5 and 39. 6 % on days 1, 7, 14, 21 and 28, respectively. At each challenge point, the mortality and anti-feeding effects on sandflies were significantly differ-ent between the control and treatment groups (p < 0. 05). The adulticidal effect on C. canis remained above 99 % through-out the study period. The results indicate that a combination with <b>dinotefuran,</b> permethrin and pyriproxyfenmay be used as an effective part of an overall flea and sandfly control strategy in dogs for monthly use...|$|E
40|$|Bioassays were {{designed}} to evaluate Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo) Vuillemin strain GHA against Listronotus maculicollis (Kirby) adults. B. bassiana and its “inert” carrier oil in the product BotaniGard and the “inert” carrier oil alone provided 99 and 96 % mortality respectively in Petri dish assays 1 d after treatment when applied in 1 ml water. When the same treatments were applied in 0. 5 ml of carrier water mortality was only 1. 4 and 0. 7 % respectively 1 d after treatment. After 10 d in Petri dishes, B. bassiana and its “inert” carrier oil and the “inert” carrier oil alone applied in 0. 5 ml water showed 77 and 9 % mortality respectively. When one-tenth the label dosage of B. bassiana and “inert” carrier oil was combined with neonicotinoids clothianidin, imidacloprid, and <b>dinotefuran</b> applied in 1 ml water, there were significant increases (34, 30, and 68 % respectively) in weevil mortality over the neonicotinoids alone 1 d after treatment. When one-tenth the label dosage of “inert” carrier oil alone was combined with neonicotinoids clothianidin, imidacloprid, and <b>dinotefuran</b> applied in 1 ml water, there were also significant increases with clothianidin and <b>dinotefuran</b> (38 and 24 % respectively) in weevil mortality over the neonicotinoids alone 1 d after treatment. B. bassiana and its “inert” carrier oil provided 28, 50, and 78 % mortality at the highest label dosage and 47, 76, and 89 % mortality at 4 × the highest label dosage in turf plug assays at 7, 10, and 14 d after treatment. Addition of 5 or 20 % MycoMax (a nutrient source for B. bassiana) did not significantly increase mortality in turfgrass plug assays. ELISA plates {{were used to determine}} the amounts of clothianidin and imidacloprid in Poa annua clippings from treated golf course fairways. Amounts of clothianidin ranged from 71. 8 to 1238. 1 ng/g tissue in 2011 and 68. 8 to 2045. 0 ng/g tissue in 2012. Amounts of imidacloprid ranged from 40. 8 to 1679. 2 ng/g tissue in 2011 and 116. 8 to 3722. 0 ng/g tissue in 2012. Listronotus maculicollis adults were caged on neonicotinoid and neonicotinoid/pyrethroid treated P. annua plugs. Substantial feeding on P. annua was observed; however, mortality of L. maculicollis adults was not significantly different from control plugs. We were not able to determine concentrations of either clothianidin or imidacloprid that were effective in controlling larvae. Our data help to explain the lack of control of this insecticide resistant pest. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA novel spot-on {{formulation}} combining permethrin, pyriproxifen and <b>dinotefuran</b> (Vectra 3 D™ spot-on {{solution for}} dogs) was evaluated in adult Beagle dogs {{in a study}} to determine adulticidal efficacy, egg laying inhibition and viability of Ctenocephalides felis felis eggs (development and emergence of fleas from the collected eggs). Prior to treatment sixteen dogs were checked {{for their ability to}} keep fleas 24 hours after infestation and were allocated to treatment groups: 8 dogs served as untreated controls, and 8 dogs were treated once with the tested formulation. The spot on was administered respecting the laboratory recommendations at a dosage of 65 – 126 mg/kg of permethrin; 8. 9 – 17. 4 mg/kg of <b>dinotefuran</b> and 0. 8 – 1. 5 mg/kg of pyriproxyfen. Each dog was infested with 100 adult cat fleas ready to lay eggs after 72 hours spent feeding on cats. Dogs were infested 24 hours after treatment and then weekly during 63 days. Eggs were collected and counted 24 hours after each infestation and dogs were combed 48 hours after each infestation. Fleas were counted and removed. Collected eggs were placed in incubator to study their development in larvae and into newly emerged adults. A single treatment provided 99. 7 % adulticidal efficacy on fleas within 48 hours after treatment and controlled re-infestations for up to 30 days (efficacy > 96. 20 %, p< 0. 05). The egg laying inhibition was over 92. 3 % for up to 29 days (p< 0. 05). The adult emergence inhibition remained 100 % during 8 weeks after treatment and was 99. 8 % nine weeks after treatment (p< 0. 001) ...|$|E
40|$|Bed bug (Cimex lectularius L.) infestations are {{becoming}} increasingly common in low-income communities. Once they are introduced, elimination is very difficult. As part of the efforts to develop effective and safe bed bug management programs, we conducted a laboratory study evaluating the efficacy of a reduced-risk insecticide—Alpine aerosol (0. 5 % <b>dinotefuran).</b> We then conducted a field evaluation of a reduced-risk insecticide based integrated pest management (IPM) program in low-income family apartments with young children. In laboratory evaluations, direct spray and 5 min exposure to dry Alpine aerosol residue caused 100. 0 ± 0. 0 and 91. 7 ± 8. 3 % mortality to bed bug nymphs, respectively. Direct Alpine aerosol spray killed 91. 3 ± 4. 3 % of the eggs. The IPM program included education, steam, bagging infested linens, placing intercepting devices under furniture legs and corners of rooms, applying Alpine aerosol and Alpine dust (0. 25 % <b>dinotefuran,</b> 95 % diatomaceous earth dust), and regularly scheduled monitoring and re-treatment. Nine apartments ranging from 1 – 1, 428 (median: 29) bed bugs based on visual inspection and Climbup interceptor counts were included. Over a 6 -month period, an average 172 g insecticide (Alpine aerosol + Alpine dust) was used in each apartment, a 96 % reduction in pesticide usage compared to chemical only treatment reported in a similar environment. The IPM program resulted in an average of 96. 8 ± 2. 2 % {{reduction in the number}} of bed bugs. However, elimination of bed bugs was only achieved in three lightly infested apartments (< 30 bed bugs at the beginning). Elimination success was closely correlated with the level of bed bug populations...|$|E
40|$|The {{negative}} effects of a commonly applied systemic insecticide, neonicotinoid, on the honey bee Apis mellifera L. are of great concern worldwide, {{as the use of}} the chemical is expanding. Recently, special {{attention has been paid to}} the sublethal effects of insecticides. An increasing number of studies has identified sublethal effects on the honey bee in the laboratory or in experimental cages, but so far, few studies have examined sublethal effects in the field. To reveal sublethal effects under field conditions, I ex-amined whether the proportion of successful homing flights by foraging honey bees during 30 min after release decreased after bees were topically exposed to insecticides. Honey bees were treated with two types of neonicotinoid insecticide (clothianidin, <b>dinotefuran)</b> and two types of previously common insecticide (etofenprox [pyrethroid] and fenitrothion [organophosphate]) at five different doses (one-half, one-fourth, one-tenth, one-twentieth, and one-fortieth of their median lethal dose- LD 50). Then the bees were released 500 m from their hives in the field. The proportions of successful homing flights by bees exposed to neonicotinoids and pyrethroid decreased with doses of one-tenth LD 50 (2. 18 ng / head for clothianidin, 7. 5 ng / head for <b>dinotefuran)</b> or more and one-fourth LD 50 (32. 5 ng / head for pyrethroid) or more, respectively, whereas bees exposed to organophosphate did not signifi-cantly show a response at any sublethal dose though the trend in decline appeared to. Flight times were not significantly different among treatments at any dose. These results indicate that neonicotinoid and pyrethroid exposure reduced successful homing flights at doses far below the LD 50 in the field. Moreover, neonicotinoid caused reductions at relatively lower exposure than pyre-throid...|$|E
40|$|With {{increasing}} use of new pesticide formulations worldwide {{to repel}} and kill unwanted organisms, negative consequences on non-target species such as honey bees and other pollinators are of increasing concern and not well studied. This study compares the nanotechnology based pesticide (NBP) Safari and its base neonicotinoid, <b>dinotefuran,</b> and their effect on bee death using liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). This research examines whether nanotechnology based pesticides, with particles smaller than pollen, can transfer more readily to the bees than the active ingredient alone and does the NBP have a longer residual toxicity to bees. This transfer can occur {{in the same manner}} that pollen is transferred from flowers to bees, or the particles may cling to pollen which is then collected by bees and returned to the hive...|$|E
40|$|Background Neonicotinoids, {{which are}} novel pesticides, have entered into usage {{around the world}} because they are {{selectively}} toxic to arthropods and relatively non-toxic to vertebrates. It {{has been suggested that}} several neonicotinoids cause neurodevelopmental toxicity in mammals. The aim was to establish the relationship between oral intake and urinary excre-tion of neonicotinoids by humans to facilitate biological monitoring, and to estimate dietary neonicotinoid intakes by Japanese adults. Methodology/Principal Findings Deuterium-labeled neonicotinoid (acetamiprid, clothianidin, <b>dinotefuran,</b> and imidacloprid) microdoses were orally ingested by nine healthy adults, and 24 h pooled urine samples were collected for 4 consecutive days after dosing. The excretion kinetics were modeled using one- and two-compartment models, then validated in a non-deuterium-labeled neoni-cotinoid microdose study involving 12 healthy adults. Increased urinary concentrations of labeled neonicotinoids were observed after dosing. Clothianidin was recovered unchange...|$|E
