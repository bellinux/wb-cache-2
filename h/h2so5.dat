50|$|<b>H2SO5</b> {{has been}} used for a variety of {{disinfectant}} and cleaning applications, e.g., swimming pool treatment and denture cleaning. Alkali metal salts of <b>H2SO5</b> show promise for the delignification of wood.|$|E
50|$|<b>H2SO5</b> {{was first}} {{described}} in 1898 by Heinrich Caro, after {{whom it is}} named.|$|E
50|$|Ammonium, sodium, and {{potassium}} salts of <b>H2SO5</b> {{are used in}} the plastic industry as polymerization initiators, etchants, desizing agents, soil conditioner, and for decolorizing and deodorizing oils.|$|E
50|$|<b>H2SO5</b> is {{sometimes}} confused with H2S2O8, known as peroxydisulfuric acid. The disulfuric acid, {{which appears to}} be more widely used as its alkali metal salts, has the structure HO-S(O)2-O-O-S(O)2-OH.|$|E
50|$|Peroxymonosulfuric acid, (<b>H2SO5),</b> {{also known}} as persulfuric acid, peroxysulfuric acid, or Caro's acid, is a liquid at room temperature. In this acid, the S(VI) center adopts its {{characteristic}} tetrahedral geometry; the connectivity is indicated by the formula HO-O-S(O)2-OH. It {{is one of the}} strongest oxidants known (E0 = +2.51 V) and is highly explosive.|$|E
50|$|Inorganic {{peroxides}} {{are divided}} into ionic and covalent peroxide. The first class mostly contains the peroxides of the alkali and alkaline earth metals whereas the covalent peroxides are represented by such compounds as hydrogen peroxide and peroxymonosulfuric acid (<b>H2SO5).</b> In contrast to the purely ionic character of alkali metal peroxides, peroxides of transition metals have a more covalent character.It {{should be noted that}} in some older literature some high-valence metal oxides are incorrectly named peroxides (e.g. PbO2, MnO2, Ag4O4) even though they do not contain the peroxide ion.|$|E
50|$|The Inco {{process can}} {{typically}} lower cyanide concentrations to below 50 mg/L, whereas the Caro's acid process can lower cyanide levels to between 10 and 50 mg/L, {{with the lower}} concentrations achievable in solution streams rather than slurries. Caro's acid - peroxomonosulphuric acid (<b>H2SO5)</b> - converts cyanide to cyanate. Cyanate then hydrolyses to ammonium and carbonate ions. The Caro's acid process is able to achieve discharge levels of WAD below 50 mg/L, which is generally suitable for discharge to tailings. Hydrogen peroxide and basic chlorination {{can also be used}} to oxidize cyanide, although these approaches are less common.|$|E
