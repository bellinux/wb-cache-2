40|$|The {{gasification}} {{of biomass}} is potentially an efficient and economically viable technology {{to assist in}} reducing the global dependence on fossil fuels and carbon dioxide emission. CE-CERT steam <b>hydrogasification</b> technology combines hydrogen with water to convert carbonaceous matters to a high energetic synthesis gas which offers several advantages for biomass gasification compared to other mainstream gasification technologies. Although steam <b>hydrogasification</b> {{appears to be an}} advantageous gasification technology, it still needs to be improved for optimum efficiencies to assess the overall commercial viability. A particular challenge for the scaling-up steam <b>hydrogasification</b> process is the low reactivity of carbon with hydrogen. The gas residence time in the large-scale gasifier needs to be substantially long to account for the slow reaction rate in the presence of hydrogen. The consequence is that much larger size and more expensive gasifier is required to implement the large-scale CE-CERT process which leads to a considerably high initial investment cost. The main objective of this thesis is to investigate the effect of biosolids serving on the steam <b>hydrogasification</b> of biomass for improving the steam <b>hydrogasification</b> efficiency. The use of biosolids is motivated by its low cost, integrated in the steam gasification as the feedstock and the potential for catalytic effect due to its typically high concentration in iron and calcium. This research will not only contribute to technological analysis for the scaling-up CE-CERT steam <b>hydrogasification</b> process but also provide an alternative pathway for biosolids energy recovery in a cost-efficient manner. Characteristics and kinetics of steam <b>hydrogasification</b> of biomass was investigated initially in chapter two with the objectives to optimize the reaction conditions and to establish a simplified approach for kinetic measurements in the steam <b>hydrogasification.</b> A newly designed laboratory-scale reactor, referred to as the inverted batch reactor is used in this thesis. This reactor succeeded performing the desired realistic thermal conditions to allow for fundamental laboratory studies of the steam <b>hydrogasification.</b> The heating rate and temperature were found to have significant influence on the steam <b>hydrogasification.</b> Kinetic parameters were obtained by using a first-order kinetic model based on product gas formation. Steam <b>hydrogasification</b> of the co-mingled biosolids with biomass was investigated in chapter three to determine the effect of biosolids on the steam <b>hydrogasification</b> of biomass. It is experimentally demonstrated that the biosolids integrated in the feed dramatically improved the steam <b>hydrogasification</b> efficiency not only in carbon conversion but also in gasification reaction rate. The steam <b>hydrogasification</b> with 50 wt% biosolids in the feed yielded more than 70 % carbon conversion at 700 oC. There was an approximately 6 % increase in the carbon conversion compared to the steam <b>hydrogasification</b> of biomass. The gasification rates of CH 4 and CO formation were enhanced by 18 % and 12 %, respectively. The characterization of metal elemental compositions in the biosolids revealed that the biosolids was particular rich in Fe, Ca. Catalytic steam <b>hydrogasification</b> of biomass with different catalysts based on metal compounds of Fe, Ca, Mg, Na and K is investigated in chapter three. Steam <b>hydrogasification</b> of biomass with non-catalysts, with the in-situ biosolids and with the added catalysts were evaluated to identify the catalytic activity of biosolids. The catalytic activity of catalysts in the steam <b>hydrogasification</b> for CO formation followed the order of iron catalysts > biosolids > other tested catalysts. And the catalytic activity for CH 4 formation was in the sequence of calcined dolomite > biosolids > other tested catalysts. Biosolids in-situ integrated in biomass feedstock was found to be highly active and effective to catalyze the steam <b>hydrogasification</b> and improve the steam <b>hydrogasification</b> efficiency. The catalytic action of biosolids on the steam <b>hydrogasification</b> may be attributed to the synergistic effect of iron, calcium and alkali metals in the biosolids...|$|E

40|$|Potassium catalyzed {{isothermal}} coal <b>hydrogasification</b> was investigated, as {{an alternative}} route for synthetic natural gas production. Potassium chemisorption occurred on oxygen sites in the coal structure and was strongly affected by the solution pH and followed the Cation Exchange Capability (CEC) which is also pH-dependent. A quadratic function described {{the relation between the}} solution pH and the fraction of the chemisorbed potassium, while; the cumulative distribution function of two Weibull probability density functions correlated the solution pH with the CEC that was linearly correlated with the fraction of the chemisorbed potassium. Coal <b>hydrogasification</b> is strongly affected by the increased alkalinity of the impregnating solution and increased methane yields were obtained while carbon conversion was slightly affected. This was attributed to the formation of profuse K+ substituted active sites that decompose under H 2 attacks and trigger scission of the aromatic rings followed by K+ migration to neighboring complexes, thus, the <b>hydrogasification</b> reaction continuous to yield CH 4, as codified in a three stage reaction mechanism. The relative specific <b>hydrogasification</b> rate was found to increase linearly with the CEC of the coal samples, suggesting that the oxygen functional groups, on which potassium is chemisorbed, act as “active sites” and are linked with the carbon’s reactivity...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} aimed at the process development, design, {{modeling}} and optimization of synthetic fuels, power and Substitute Natural Gas (SNG) production from coal and biomass with economic analysis based on steam <b>hydrogasification</b> technology. The steam <b>hydrogasification</b> is a thermochemical process to convert carbonaceous materials into methane-rich gas in the Steam <b>Hydrogasification</b> Reactor (SHR) at high hydrogen and steam environment. The methane could be either converted into syngas in the Steam Methane Reformer (SMR) for synthetic fuels production or used as SNG after going through the Water Gas Shift (WGS) reactor. Optimum operation conditions for the SHR are determined based on mass and heat balance analysis derived from the Aspen Plus simulation results as well as data collected from experiments. Facilities utilizing bituminous coal and biomass green waste for coproduction of synthetic fuels and electricity are designed in detail. Cases with design capacity of 4, 000 TPD (coal, dry basis) and 2, 000 TPD (green waste, dry basis) are investigated with process modeling and cost estimation. The plant performance and capital cost is used as major inputs in the power financial model for process economics evaluation. The analysis shows that the coal plant with 90 % Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS) using a cobalt catalyst in Fischer Tropsch synthesis is expected to produce 8, 548 barrels fuels per day with production cost of 2. 07 $/gal diesel equivalent at 12 % Internal Rate of Return (IRR) and 54 $/MWh electricity sale price. The biomass plant is expected to produce 2, 430 barrels fuels per day with production cost ranging from 1. 55 $/gallon to 3. 65 $/gallon diesel equivalent. The green waste and biosolid-to-SNG plant is expected to produce 19, 848 MMBTU SNG per day with production cost ranging from 2. 53 $/MMBTU to 15. 23 $/MMBTU. The process simulation and economic analysis presented here demonstrate that the steam <b>hydrogasification</b> technology could potentially provide an effective pathway to convert coal and biomass to fuels with high conversion efficiency and less capital cost. The steam <b>hydrogasification</b> process appears to be suitable for commercialization in large scales with a coal feedstock and also in a distributed network of small scale facility utilizing localized renewable feedstocks. Financial incentives such as tax incentives, waste tipping fee, and other mechanisms are significant parameters in addressing the economic and market challenges of biomass derived fuels.

The project planned to develop, test, operate and evaluate a 2 ton-per-day coal <b>hydrogasification</b> plant and 25 -acre algae farm at the Arizona Public Service (APS) 1000 Megawatt (MW) Cholla coal-fired power plant in Joseph City, Arizona. Conceptual design of the integrated system was undertaken with APS partners Air Liquide (AL) and Parsons. The process engineering was separated into five major areas: flue gas preparation and CO 2 delivery, algae farming, water management, <b>hydrogasification,</b> and biofuel production. The process flow diagrams, energy and material balances, and preliminary major equipment needs for each major area were prepared to reflect integrated process considerations and site infrastructure design basis. The total project also included research and development on a bench-scale hydrogasifier, one-dimensional (1 -D) kinetic-model simulation, extensive algae stressing, oil extraction, lipid analysis and a half-acre algae farm demonstration at APS?s Redhawk testing facility. During the project, a two-acre algae testing facility with a half-acre algae cultivation area was built at the APS Redhawk 1000 MW natural gas {{combined cycle power plant}} located 55 miles west of Phoenix. The test site integrated flue gas delivery, CO 2 capture and distribution, algae cultivation, algae nursery, algae harvesting, dewatering and onsite storage as well as water treatment.

40|$|We {{present an}} update on the {{development}} of technologies required for the Zero Emission Carbon (ZEC) concept being pursued by ZECA Corporation. The concept has a highly integrated design involving <b>hydrogasification,</b> a calcium oxide driven reforming step that includes simultaneous C 02 separation, coal compatible fuel cells for electricity production and heat recovery, and a closed loop gas system in which coal contaminants are removed either as liquids or solids. The process does not involve any combustion and as such has neither smokestack nor air emissions. An independent assessment of the concept by Nexant, a Bcchtel affiliated company, suggests a net efficiency of approximately 70 % for conversion of the higher heat value fuel energy into electrical output. This is even after the penalties of carbon dioxide separation and pressurization to 1000 psi are taken into account. For carbon dioxide sequestration a variety of options are being considered, which include enhanced oil recovery in the near-term and mineral carbonation as a long-term approach.

40|$|The {{development}} of sustainable fuels from biomass has become important {{due to the}} depletion of fossil fuels and concerns of global climate change. Microalgae offer several advantages as sources for bioenergy; their rapid growth rate, high productivity and lipid content, ability to cultivate in places other than on farmlands, or arable land, {{and their ability to}} capture CO 2 from flue gas which {{can be used as a}} source for photosynthesis. Microalgae are able to produce a wide range of biofuels including biodiesel, methane, ethanol, hydrogen, and synthetic fuels using different conversion technologies. High energy requirements and the cost for dewatering/drying and extraction are major drawbacks. The steam <b>hydrogasification</b> (SHR) process is attractive as an alternative for the conversion of microalgae to biofuels because the SHR can handle wet microalgae biomass without drying or extraction and been shown to have high carbon conversion efficiencies. The overall objective of this thesis is to investigate the feasibility of using whole microalgae directly (wet biomass) and/or using the microalgae residue after lipid extraction to produce low carbon sustainable fuel using the CE–CERT process. Steam <b>hydrogasification</b> can convert microalgae to a high energetic synthesis gas in the presence of steam and hydrogen. The carbon in the synthesis gas then can be converted to synthetic fuels and electricity.; The performance of steam <b>hydrogasification</b> of microalgae was investigated by varying parameters including gasification temperature, H 2 /C and steam/biomass ratios. It was found that the operating conditions at a gasification temperature 750 °C, a steam/biomass ratio of 2 and H 2 /C ratio of 1 could provide richer in methane production and high carbon conversion (65 %) using microalgae as a feedstock. The hydrogen in the product gas was sufficient to maintain a self–sustained supply back to the SHR. One ton per day of microalgae biomass is expected to produce FT fuel of 1. 06 barrel with an overall thermal efficiency of 27 %. The utilization of the microalgae residue from traditional transesterification and the effect of different lipid content of different microalgae using the steam <b>hydrogasification</b> process was investigated also. It was found that the SHR could use microalgae residue to reduce the algae waste and recover energy of about 4. 9 MJ/kg dry microalgae residue. A higher lipid content would enhance the performance of the SHR in terms of carbon conversion and production of methane that resulted in more FT fuel. Life cycle energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions for the production of Fischer–Tropsch (FT) fuel derived from microalgae using the CE–CERT process were calculated and compared to microalgae to biodiesel production using transesterification. It was found that life cycle energy requirements for the microalgae biofuel production using CE–CERT process were significantly lower (about 50 %) compared to the transesterification process. The life cycle analysis showed that the lowest energy consumption to be 1. 96 MJ/MJ fuel (40 wt% of lipid content) compared to microalgae to biodiesel production. CE–CERT technology reduces the GHG emissions by 50 – 64 % compared to production of conventional diesel fuel...|$|E

S. Department of Energy (DOE) contract: DE-FC 26 - 06 NT 42759 for Substitute Natural Gas (SNG) production from western coal. A double-wall (i. e., a <b>hydrogasification</b> contained within a pressure shell) down-flow <b>hydrogasification</b> reactor was designed, engineered, constructed, commissioned and operated by APS, Phoenix, AZ. The reactor is ASME-certified under Section VIII with a rating of 1150 pounds per square inch gage (psig) maximum allowable working pressure at 1950 degrees Fahrenheit ({degrees}F). The reaction zone had a 1. 75 inch inner diameter and 13 feet length. The initial testing of a sub-bituminous coal demonstrated ~ 50 % carbon conversion and ~ 10 % methane yield in the product gas under 1625 {degrees}F, 1000 psig pressure, with a 11 seconds (s) residence time, and 0. 4 hydrogen-to-coal mass ratio. Liquid by-products mainly contained Benzene, Toluene, Xylene (BTX) and tar. Char collected {{from the bottom of the}} reactor had 9000 -British thermal units per pound (Btu/lb) heating value. A three-dimensional (3 D) computational fluid dynamic model simulation of the hydrodynamics around the reactor head was utilized to design the nozzles for injecting the hydrogen into the gasifier to optimize gas-solid mixing to achieve improved carbon conversion. The report also {{presents the}} evaluation of using algae for carbon dioxide (CO{sub 2 }) management and biofuel production. Nannochloropsis, Selenastrum and Scenedesmus were determined to be the best algae strains for the project purpose and were studied in an outdoor system which included a 6 -meter (6 M) radius cultivator with a total surface area of 113 square meters (m{sup 2 }) and a total culture volume between 10, 000 to 15, 000 liters (L); a CO{sub 2 } on-demand feeding system; an on-line data collection system for temperature, pH, Photosynthetically Activate Radiation (PAR) and dissolved oxygen (DO); and a ~ 2 gallons per minute (gpm) algae culture dewatering system.

40|$|Energy {{security}} {{and climate change}} are two common challenges in the coming decades. The demand for energy is increasing. The CO 2 in the atmosphere has increased to almost 400 ppm, and it is mainly from energy usage. How to deal with energy-related CO 2 emissions with the increasing demand for energy is becoming more crucial. Carbon capture and sequestration during energy production is {{an efficient way to}} guarantee enough energy supply with a smaller carbon footprint. One unique technique is using in-situ CO 2 capture technology, which uses a sorbent to capture CO 2 directly in the reactor. CO 2 is removed quickly as it forms by the sorbent, which can change the equilibrium to promote more energetic production. This technology has great potential to lower CO 2 emissions and get higher energy production simultaneously. A new concept of sorption enhanced steam <b>hydrogasification</b> reaction (SE-SHR) is the topic of this thesis. It combines sorption enhanced principles with the steam <b>hydrogasification</b> reaction (SHR). It was found that the addition of sorbent enhanced the CO 2 removal and increased the production of H 2 and CH 4. Particularly, the amount of H 2 was increased dramatically. It was found that the increase in H 2 was enough to recycle when the CaO/C molar ratio was over 0. 29. The sorption enhanced performance was also evaluated by varying other parameters including H 2 /C and Steam/C molar ratio, gasification temperature and sorbent particle size. A study of the kinetics of the system showed that higher gasification temperature favored faster formation rates of CO 2, CO and CH 4 during both SHR and SE-SHR. The formation rates of CO 2 and CO at 650 °C, 700 °C and 750 °C were much lower during SE-SHR. Several configurations based on SE-SHR for the production of Fischer Tropsch fuel and synthetic natural gas were developed and evaluated. The optimum gasification condition (H 2 /C-Steam/C) for Fischer Tropsch fuel production using SE-SHR based process was found to be 1. 59 - 2. 78. This process had lower total CO 2 emissions with higher fuel yield compared to the optimum SHR based process.

40|$|Liquid fuels {{produced}} via {{the steam}} <b>hydrogasification</b> of biomass feedstock followed by downstream {{gas to liquid}} processes {{appears to be a}} cost effective approach to replace fossil fuels, to decrease the dependence of imported oil and to decrease greenhouse gas emissions. A critical technical obstacle of using biomass feedstock effectively in many gasification processes, including steam <b>hydrogasification,</b> is the need to prepare a high carbon concentrated (i. e., high energy) slurry that can be introduced into a pressurized reactor in a cost effective and energy efficient manner. Conventional dry feeding systems, such as lock-hopper and pressurized pneumatic transport, are complex, unreliable, and operationally expensive. An extra carrier gas is needed in some instances or vibrators to avoid fluctuations in the quantity of feed introduced into the reactor. Slurry feeding is a simpler, reliable, and inexpensive method of transporting and pressurizing the feedstock into gasification reactors and has been demonstrated in commercial scale application using 100 % coal. Biomass slurries have less energy density compared to coal and require high carbon content in order to be efficiently gasified. The hygroscopic and hydrophilic nature of biomass results in a significantly reduced amount of carbon in pumpable slurries. The main goal of this thesis was to develop, design, and implement a Hydro-Thermal Pretreatment (HTP) process that will result in a pumpable biomass slurry with high energy and carbon content for use in a commercial scale, pressurized steam <b>hydrogasification</b> reactor. The first objective of this thesis was to design, build and evaluate the performance of a laboratory scale HTP process. Four carbonaceous feedstocks (coal-wood-water, wood-water, wood-biosolids and wood-manure) were hydrothermally treated using a procedure developed as part of this thesis. The viscosity, flow and energy content were determined under various experimental conditions including: particle size; initial composition of feedstocks (carbon/water ratio), thermal input (time and temperature of the heating process) and head space gas composition as a consequence of heating. The rheology properties and the settling velocities of the particles for the resultant slurries were evaluated before and after HTP. An empirical model was developed to simulate the rheology properties. The modeling work was necessary to assist with predicting flow behavior of the slurry for commercial applications. The carbon balance for the cumulative gas, liquid and solid phases of the feedstock slurry after HTP was analyzed to determine the carbon recovery in the slurries and found to be greater than 98 % recovery. Finally, the heating value of pretreated wood particles was determined to estimate the energy recovery in the slurries which was also found to be in excess of 98 %. The second objective of this thesis focused on obtaining {{a better understanding of the}} chemical mechanism of the formation of the biomass slurry as a consequence of the HTP. Four mechanisms and analytical methods were utilized to assist in the explanation: 1. Surface charge alternation, zeta potentials of raw wood particle and pretreated wood particle were analyzed and compared; 2. Particle shrink, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) comparison of wood particles before and after HTP were compared to visualize this effect of HTP; 3. Free bulk water release from biomass microstructure, both SEM observation and liquid-solid distribution of slurry were used to confirm porous site generation and free water release into bulk phase. The third objective of this thesis focused on the design and scale up of HTP at the lab scale basis, a demonstration scale basis and a commercial scale basis. The lab scale and demonstration scale HTP process was designed and tested in our laboratory.

Coal gasification technology was advanced: {{by the development of}} gasi-fiers using oxygen; by operating at elevated pressure, under slagging conditions, and with a fluidized bed; and by demonstrating the feasibility of <b>hydrogasification.</b> During the period the efficient by-product coke oven almost completely replaced the beehive oven for producing metallurgical coke. progressed from the laboratory to the full-scale commercial plant.

40|$|The steam <b>hydrogasification</b> {{reaction}} (SHR) {{refers to}} the thermochemical conversion of carbonaceous materials into synthetic gas in a steam and hydrogen environment. The formation of gaseous sulfur species from the solid sulfur in the feedstock is commonplace in thermochemical processes. It requires the cleaning of the output gas to protect the operation of downstream processes and catalysts. This thesis {{presents the results of}} an experimental study to determine the effect of temperature, steam and H 2 partial pressure has on the distribution of the various gaseous sulfur species in the outlet gas of the SHR. Experiment results showed that sulfur in the feedstock is mainly converted to H 2 S in the SHR process. COS and CS 2 were undetectable. The H 2 and steam rich environment in the SHR process are favorable for the formation of H 2 S and suppress the COS and CS 2 formation. An increase of H 2 S concentration was observed with the rise in temperature from 700 oC to 800 oC. An increase in the partial pressure of H 2 decreased the H 2 S concentration released in the gas phase. A lab-scale warm gas cleanup system was developed by using commercial ZnO sorbents based above results. A mixture gas simulated the composition of syngas from steam <b>hydrogasification</b> reaction was used as the feed gas. The effect of space velocity and gas composition on H 2 S breakthrough time was studied. It was found that H 2 S breakthrough time and sulfur capture capacity increased as the space velocity decreased. Moreover, addition of H 2 or CH 4 to the inlet gas stream has the positive effect on H 2 S breakthrough time. However, Addition of CO to the inlet gas stream decreased H 2 S breakthrough time. And addition of low content of CO 2 to the inlet gas stream almost has no influence on H 2 S breakthrough time. Techno-economic analysis was performed based on experimental and Aspen Plus simulation results in order to design warm gas cleanup system for CE-CERT process. Warm gas cleanup process by using regenerable sorbent is feasible for high capacity plant (syngas feed >= 1000 tonne/day). And warm gas cleanup process by using disposable sorbent is more feasible for low capacity plant (syngas feed < 1000 tonne/day). Economic sensitivity results showed that H 2 availability and price is the most influential parameter affecting the cost for warm gas cleanup process by using regenerable sorbent, while ZnO sorbent price is the most influential parameters affecting the cost for warm gas cleanup process by using disposable sorbent...|$|E

Each process is evaluated for its potential to produce SNG from a bituminous coal. In addition to identifying the new technology these processes represent, key similarities/differences, strengths/weaknesses, and potential improvements to each process are identified. The AVCO HTG and the Bell HMF gasifiers share similarities with respect to: short residence time (SRT), high throughput rate, slagging and syngas as the initial raw product gas. The CS/R Hydrogasifier is also SRT but is non-slagging and produces a raw gas high in methane content. The Exxon CCG gasifier is a long residence time, catalytic, fluidbed reactor producing all of the raw product methane in the gasifier. The report makes the following assessments: 1) while each process has significant potential as coal gasifiers, the CS/R and Exxon processes are better suited for SNG production; 2) the Exxon process is the closest to a commercial level for near-term SNG production; and 3) the SRT processes require significant development including scale-up and turndown demonstration, char processing and/or utilization demonstration, and reactor control and safety features development...|$|E
40|$|The Hynol Process for {{conversion}} of coal {{and natural gas}} to methanol as a liquid fuel consists of three consecutive unit operations: (1) <b>hydrogasification</b> of coal, (2) steam reforming of the methane formed and added natural gas feedstock, and (3) catalytic methanol synthesis. The Hynol Process is a total recycle process. Using a process simulation computer program, mass and energy balances and yields and efficiency data have been obtained {{for a range of}} natural gas to coal feedstock ratios. Although the methanol yield increases with natural gas to coal feed ratio, the cost of feedstock per unit methanol is insensitive over a wide range of feedstock ratios. The Hynol Process produces a 13 % increase in methanol yield compared to the equivalent of two separate conventional coal gasification and natural gas reforming plants. The CO{sub 2 } emissions are reduced by 22 % for the Hynol plant compared to the conventional processes with greater CO{sub 2 } reductions at lower gas to coal feedstock ratios. A preliminary cost estimate for a 10, 000 tons/day Hynol methanol plant indicates a lower production cost than the current cost of methanol by the conventional natural gas reforming plant. The lower unit energy cost for coal is beneficial in reducing the methanol cost in the Hynol Process...|$|E
40|$|The current thesis {{consists}} on six (6) chapters. In Chapter 1, {{the global}} energy system {{was investigated in}} terms of world primary energy demand evolution and fossil fuels sustained domination. In order to further sustain fossil fuels as the primary energy sources, CO 2 capture and storage technologies (CCS) should be introduced as quick as possible, so as to restrict their impact on green house gas effect and climate change. The main means that will enhance the implementation of CCS technologies were also presented. Such measures include the operation of a CO 2 Emissions Trading Scheme, {{and a set of}} EU initiatives as: the establishment of the Zero Emissions Technology Platform ZEP, the funding of large scale CCS pilot units, the new CO 2 reduction commitments for 2020 and the preparation for these achievements by launching a new regulatory framework with the new climate-energy legislative package. The long term target for a ‘hydrogen and fuel cells economy’ was also presented through the materialized and projected targets of the EU Hydrogen and Fuel cells technology platform. In Chapter 1 the thesis concluded that both CCS and Fuel Cells technologies are important for the sustenance of fossil fuels with restricted CO 2 emissions and also for a feasible technological roadmap towards a hydrogen economy. The main characteristics of the CCS and Fuel Cells technologies were presented in Chapter 2. The chapter mainly focuses on the promising Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs) technology and its specific operational characteristics that enable their involvement in CO 2 capture applications. Chapter 3 reviews the available options for proper high temperature cleaning of a syngas produced by coal gasification in order to be utilised in Solid Oxide Fuel Cells. The combination of coal with SOFCs requires an extensive cleaning of the pollutants generated in the gasification phase. Gas cleaning should be implemented in high temperature in order to avoid sensible heat losses that reduce system’s efficiency. The most suited materials for hot gas cleaning were derived through the literature review and through chemical equilibrium calculations, and a general hot gas cleaning scheme was proposed. In Chapter 4, an integrated coal based and carbon free power cycle was designed and optimized. The proposed cycle includes: a) coal <b>hydrogasification</b> in high pressure, b) reforming of the produced methane with simultaneous CO 2 capture in two reactors that operate in different pressure levels, c) extensive gas cleaning, d) efficient power generation in Solid Oxides Fuel Cells and e) appropriate handling of the captured CO 2 in order to be delivered liquefied at high pressure (100 bar). All system components as well as the overall cycle were simulated in detail in AspenPlusTM. The main technical difficulties were identified through the cycle’s investigation and respective solutions were proposed. For the realization of the required recycling of the hydrogen rich stream from the carbonation/reforming reactor to the <b>hydrogasification</b> reactor, the use of a steam ejector was proposed. In the ejector, high pressure steam induces the gas stream and raises its pressure in suitable levels for a feasible recycling. The required steam pressure was calculated through the detailed steam ejector simulation. The use of high temperature sodium heat pipes was proposed for the high temperature heat transfer from an SOFC fluidised bed post combustor to the calcination fluidised bed. The sodium properties and the heat transfer rate were calculated for the specific fluidised reactors conditions, through detailed modelling of the sodium heat pipes. The effect of solid materials (CaO/CaCO 3) on carbonation/reforming and <b>hydrogasification</b> reactors, as well as the overall cycle was also examined. Critical conclusions on the required CaO quantities and the extend of refreshing the solid materials were derived by optimizing the specific reactor and the overall cycle. An extensive gas cleaning scheme was proposed following up the conclusions of chapter 3. Detailed results for the overall cycle optimized performance were also presented, mainly focused on the cycle’s thermal efficiency and the CO 2 capture efficiency. In Chapter 5, a tri-generation (electricity, hydrogen and heat) natural gas based and carbon free cycle was designed and evaluated with exergetic criteria. Such a cycle is ideal for decentralized applications. The cycle mainly consists of Solid Oxide Fuel Cells (SOFCs), Solid Oxide Electrolyser Cells (SOECs), CO 2 and H 2 handling equipment and lots of peripherals (heat exchangers, compressors etc). ...|$|E
40|$|The Hynol {{process is}} {{proposed}} {{to meet the}} demand for an economical process for methanol production with reduced CO{sub 2 } emission. This new process consists of three reaction steps: (a) <b>hydrogasification</b> of biomass, (b) steam reforming of the produced gas with additional natural gas feedstock, and (c) methanol synthesis of the hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced during the previous two steps. The H{sub 2 }-rich gas remaining after methanol synthesis is recycled to gasify the biomass in an energy neutral reactor so that {{there is no need for}} an expensive oxygen plant as required by commercial steam gasifiers. Recycling gas allows the methanol synthesis reactor to perform at a relatively lower pressure than conventional while the plant still maintains high methanol yield. Energy recovery designed into the process minimizes heat loss and increases the process thermal efficiency. If the Hynol methanol is used as an alternative and more efficient automotive fuel, an overall 41 % reduction in CO{sub 2 } emission can be achieved compared to the use of conventional gasoline fuel. A preliminary economic estimate shows that the total capital investment for a Hynol plant is 40 % lower than that for a conventional biomass gasification plant. The methanol production cost is $ 0. 43 /gal for a 1085 million gal/yr Hynol plant which is competitive with current U. S. methanol and equivalent gasoline prices. Process flowsheet and simulation data using biomass and natural gas as cofeedstocks are presented.

40|$|The CE-CERT Steam <b>Hydrogasification</b> Technology {{efficiently}} converts carbonaceous {{materials to}} high energetic synthesis gas. This thesis investigates the direct production of gasoline range liquid hydrocarbons with high iso-paraffin content from synthesis gas. The {{goal is to}} provide a process to efficiently produce renewable gasoline that can be used directly without modification of engine or infrastructure. An H-ZSM- 5 shell Co/Al 2 O 3 Fischer-Tropsch catalyst is prepared using a secondary-growth hydrothermal synthesis method. The catalyst not only synthesizes long-chain hydrocarbons from synthesis gas, but also cracks and isomerizes them into gasoline-range hydrocarbons with high iso-paraffin content. Characterization results show that the catalyst has good H-ZSM- 5 shell coverage with no cracks or pinholes, with a shell thickness is around 4. 29 &# 956;m. H-ZSM- 5 shell composition is confirmed by EDX and XRD. In addition, the zeolite-shell catalyst has a 10 % increase of surface area, compared to a conventional Fischer-Tropsch catalyst. A high-temperature high-pressure lab-scale continuous Fischer-Tropsch reactor with LabVIEW automation system was designed and built. The reactor system has online gas and liquid sampling capabilities. It also has a PID controller with gain scheduling for precise heating control during Fischer-Tropsch synthesis test. Safety during reactor operation is ensured with alarms and automatic emergency response system. Performance of a H-ZSM- 5 shell Co/Al 2 O 3 Fischer-Tropsch catalyst was investigated under various conditions. A maximum CO conversion of 97. 1 %, with a highest gasoline yield of 58 % and iso-paraffin selectivity of 14. 3 %, was obtained. Sensitivity analysis shows that reaction temperature significantly affects CO conversion and iso-paraffin selectivity. Catalyst silicon to aluminum ratio also influences iso-paraffin selectivity, but has no effect on CO conversion. In addition, H-ZSM- 5 shell Co/Al 2 O 3 Fischer-Tropsch catalyst has much less carbon deposition than conventional catalyst, which can help reduce catalyst deactivation rate...|$|E

40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. The hydropyrolysis of coal {{is considered to be}} an attractive future route for the conversion of coal to gaseous and liquid fuels and chemical feedstocks. This thesis comprises a study of the behaviour of coal under the conditions pertinent to those envisaged within a commercial hydropyrolysis process, that is, using pulverised coal, a short coal-reactor residence time, high hydrogen pressure and high heating rate. For this purpose, an electrically heated grid apparatus has been used. The experimental conditions have been weighted towards achieving a maximum loss of primary volatile products whilst minimising unwanted and poorly controlled secondary reactions such as char <b>hydrogasification.</b> In this way, it has been possible to compare the influence of a hydrogen atmosphere on primary devolatilisation for a range of coals. Overall, the total volatile release is enhanced by hydropyrolysis to a degree dependent upon the partial pressure of the hydrogen. The increased yield is due mainly to an increase of saturated hydrocarbons, although the production of some individual species such as carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide and unsaturated hydrocarbons are diminished with respect to helium pyrolysis. The magnitude of both total and individual product yields vary with coal type, as does the degree by which these yields are influenced by a hydrogen atmosphere. This influence is considered to depend specifically on the type and number of various reactive sites and functionalities within coal and also on their accessibility for hydrogen, which is in tum dependent upon the thermoplastic behaviour of the coal. A further factor governing both product yields and hydrogen influence is the coal petrographic composition. Inertinite macerals have been observed to be significantly more responsive than exinite or vitrinite to hydrogen, producing relatively high methane yields. Thus {{it has been shown that}} inertinite rich coals or enriched feedstocks may be suitable candidates for hydropyrolysis processing. The data obtained have also demonstrated how a number of coal properties obtained by standard analytical techniques may be used for coal selection and yield prediction. BS volatile matter, carbon content, vitrinite reflectance and both 0 /C and H/C atomic ratios are the most useful of the properties investigated in this respect. This is considered to be an important step towards the foundation of a classification system for hydropyrolysis processing...|$|E
40|$|The Advanced <b>Hydrogasification</b> Process (AHP) [...] {{conversion}} of coal to methane [...] {{is being developed}} through NETL with a DOE Grant and has successfully completed its first phase of development. The results so far are encouraging and have led to commitment by DOE/NETL to begin a second phase [...] bench scale reactor vessel testing, expanded engineering analysis and economic perspective review. During the next decade new means of generating electricity, {{and other forms of}} energy, will be introduced. The members of the AHP Team envision a need for expanded sources of natural gas or substitutes for natural gas, to fuel power generating plants. The initial work the team has completed on a process to use hydrogen to convert coal to methane (pipeline ready gas) shows promising potential. The Team has intentionally slanted its efforts toward the needs of US electric utilities, particularly on fuels that can be used near urban centers where the greatest need for new electric generation is found. The process, as it has evolved, would produce methane from coal by adding hydrogen. The process appears to be efficient using western coals for conversion to a highly sought after fuel with significantly reduced CO{sub 2 } emissions. Utilities have a natural interest in the preservation of their industry, which will require a dramatic reduction in stack emissions and an increase in sustainable technologies. Utilities tend to rank long-term stable supplies of fuel higher than most industries and are willing to trade some ratio of cost for stability. The need for sustainability, stability and environmentally compatible production are key drivers in the formation and progression of the AHP development. In Phase II, the team will add a focus on water conservation to determine how the basic gasification process can be best integrated with all the plant components to minimize water consumption during SNG production. The process allows for several CO{sub 2 } reduction options including consumption of the CO{sub 2 } in the original process as converted to methane. The process could under another option avoid emissions following the conversion to SNG through an adjunct algae conversion process. The algae would then be converted to fuels or other products. An additional application of the algae process at the end use natural gas fired plant could further reduce emissions. The APS team fully recognizes the competition facing the process from natural gas and imported liquid natural gas. While we expect those resources to set the price for methane in the near-term, the team's work to date indicates that the AHP process can be commercially competitive, with the added benefit of assuring long-term energy supplies from North American resources. Conversion of coal to a more readily transportable fuel that can be employed near load centers with an overall reduction of greenhouses gases is edging closer to reality...|$|E
40|$|Renewable Natural Gas (RNG) {{has been}} {{identified}} as an important alternative fuel that can help to achieve a number of national goals related to the reduction of fossil fuels and to the reduction in carbon dioxide emission. RNG can be produced from various carbonaceous materials such as biomass and organic wastes via a gasification process. The CE-CERT steam <b>hydrogasification</b> technology combines hydrogen with steam under pressurized conditions to convert a wet feedstock to a methane enriched syngas which can be upgraded to RNG and used for electric power and as an alternative transportation fuel. The main objective of this thesis is to develop a new process configuration of the steam hydrogasifier (SHR) using a water gas shift (WGS) reactor for the increased production of RNG in an economical manner. The producer gas from the SHR consists of H 2, CH 4, CO, CO 2 and steam. The WGS process converts CO using the existing steam in the product stream from the SHR to H 2 and CO 2. This results in a self-sustainable internal source of hydrogen that can be generated internally and of sufficient quantity to be recycled back to the SHR. In this study, a mixture gas comparable to the composition of the producer gas from the SHR when using biosolids comingled with green waste was used as the input gas to the WGS reactor. A lab-scale WGS reaction system using a commercially available high temperature shift (HTS) catalyst was designed and built. The influence of temperature, space velocity, gas composition and particle size of catalysts on the conversion of CO using this system was investigated. It was found that at optimum conditions approximately 65 % of the CO can be converted using the HTS catalyst operating at 350 o C and atmospheric pressure. The hydrogen produced at this condition was sufficient to be recycled back to the SHR. Also, the overall change of CH 4 production was negligible. A mixture gas containing a wide range of H 2 S was carried out in the shift reactor using a Sour Gas Shift (SGS) catalyst to determine the influence of sulfur impurities. The conversion of the mixture gas with 350 ppm of sulfur was 55 % at the reaction temperature of 450 o C and a space velocity of 2500 h - 1, compared to 65 % with no sulfur. The percent conversion of CO could be improved if the composition of CO 2 was decreased. A larger scale HTS reactor was designed and built using the data from the experiments mentioned above. This was integrated into a bench scale Process Demonstration Unit (PDU) of the SHR with a capacity of 0. 1 TPD of dry feed. This process configuration demonstrated the production of high levels of RNG based for the CE-CERT technology using co-mingled biosolids and woody biomass as the feedstock. The reaction temperature of the SHR and WGS reactor were set at 750 o C and 350 o C, respectively, with an operating pressure at 150 psi. A carbon conversion of 42 % for the SHR and CO conversion of 60 % of WGS were achieved at those conditions. The final product gas contained over 85 % of CH 4 after gas cleanup in which 85 MJ/day or 32. 6 MJ/m 3 of energy was produced. This result clearly shows the viability of the process and provides critical design information to upscale to a pilot facility in the near future...|$|E
