For a given fabric the polycrystal viscous response is strongly dependent on the actual state of stress and strain rate.

The aim of this work is to quantify, through the concept of enhancement factors, the influence of ice anisotropy on the flow of <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> and ice shelves. For this purpose, a full-Stokes anisotropic marine ice-sheet flowline model is used to compare isotropic and anisotropic diagnostic velocity fields on a fixed geometry.

Maritime influences may have biased this estimate, however. At Prudhoe Bay similar data imply a 1.8nbsp&°C warming over the last 100 years (Lachenbruch et al. 1982).

The subglacial meltwater also influences ocean circulation beneath ice shelves, initiating meltwater plumes that entrain warmer ocean water and cause high rates of melting 3. However, despite its importance, {{the nature of the}} hydrological system beneath the <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> sheet remains poorly characterized. Here we present evidence, from satellite and airborne remote sensing, for large channels beneath the floating Filchner–Ronne Ice Shelf in West Antarctica, which we propose provide a means for investigating the hydrological system beneath the <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> sheet. We observe features {{on the surface of the}} ice shelf from satellite imagery and, using radar measurements, show that they correspond with channels beneath the ice shelf. We also show that the sub-ice-shelf channels are aligned with locations where the outflow of subglacial meltwater has been predicted. This agreement indicates that the sub-ice-shelf channels are formed by meltwater plumes, initiated by subglacial water exiting the upstream <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> sheet in a focused (channelized) manner.

40|$|To {{reproduce}} realistic {{characteristics of}} ice sheets (i. e., velocities, thicknesses and extensions of Greenland and Antarctica), large scale ice sheets models have to empirically correct the rheological law of ice derived from laboratory measurements on isotropic samples.

For <b>grounded</b> <b>ice,</b> most authors found that an enhancement factor ranging between 3 and 5 gives adequate results and is further justified by the strong anisotropic behavior of polycristalline ice in simple shear. In other words this means that <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> in the model must be 3 to 5 times softer than predicted by the Glen's flow law. However, to simulate the entire Antarctic ice-sheet, ice-shelves {{must also be considered}} and in that case the enhancement factor must be smaller than one to prevent unrealistic high velocities. Although these two different behaviors (soft <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> / stiff ice-shelf ice) are empirically taken into account in ice-sheet models, no founded proof has never been proposed to explain this rheological difference between ice-sheet and ice-shelf.

The <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> boundary is 53 610 km long; 74 % abuts to floating ice shelves or outlet glaciers, 19 % is adjacent to open or sea-ice covered ocean, and 7 % of the boundary ice terminates on land. The freely-floating boundary, called here the hydrostatic line, is the most landward position on ice shelves that expresses the full amplitude of oscillating ocean tides. It extends 27 521 km and is discontinuous. Positional (one-sigma) accuracies of the <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> boundary vary {{an order of magnitude}} ranging from +/- 52 m for the land and open-ocean terminating segments to +/- 502 m for the outlet glaciers. The hydrostatic line is less well positioned with errors over 2 km. Elevations along each line are selected from 6 candidate digital elevation models based on their agreement with ICESat elevation values and surface shape inferred from the Landsat imagery. Elevations along the hydrostatic line are converted to ice thicknesses by applying a firn-correction factor and a flotation criterion. BEDMAP-compiled data and other airborne data are compared to the ASAID elevations and ice thicknesses to arrive at quantitative (one-sigma) uncertainties of surface elevations of +/- 3. 6, +/- 9. 6, +/- 11. 4, +/- 30 and +/- 100 m for five ASAID-assigned confidence levels. Over one-half of the surface elevations along the <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> boundary and over one-third of the hydrostatic line elevations are ranked in the highest two confidence categories.

Seismic facies analyses and correlations to sediment cores from Deep Sea Drilling Project Leg 28 drill sites show that the Ross Sea, the southwestern Pacific gateway of West Antarctica, was still mostly free of <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> for ~ 6 million years after Oi- 1, the large-amplitude oxygen-isotope shift that signaled the abrupt onset of the current Antarctic glaciation. In the Ross Sea, our analysis shows that West Antarctic glaciation had begun by the late Oligocene, much earlier than usually interpreted from the paleoceanographic proxy data. Continental ice probably existed on Marie Bird Land and other highland areas of the West Antarctica. In the central Ross Sea, ice caps nucleated on the subaerially elevated basement horst blocks of the Central and Coulman Highs. Ice caps waxed and waned across the shallow-marine platforms rimming these broad basement uplifts. These temperate glacial systems delivered much sediment to the surrounding deepwater shelf basins. Ice cap oscillations during the early and middle Miocene also included significant intervals of <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> retreat and resumption of widespread marine sedimentation. By the end of the middle Miocene, glaciation intensified, local ice caps coalesced, and <b>grounded</b> <b>ice</b> with cross-shelf ice streams eventually extended across the entire Ross Sea continental shelf.
