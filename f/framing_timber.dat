5000|$|After a last futile {{attempt to}} renew the lease, Burbage took action. He leased the Blackfriars to {{impresario}} Henry Evans, whose intended use of it for performances by children did not attract opposition. The situation regarding the Theatre was more problematic. The lease, however, gave him {{the right to use}} the <b>framing</b> <b>timber</b> of the building, if he did so before the expiration of the lease. When he did not do so, Alleyn announced his intention to use the timber for his own purposes. Looking for a place for his new theatre, Burbage made a verbal agreement with Nicholas Brend for a lease on a stretch of land on Maid Lane in Bankside, near Philip Henslowe's Rose Theatre. Burbage hired Peter Streete to take down the old Theatre and to build the new one from as much of the salvaged material as possible. On the night of 28 December 1598, Cuthbert, Richard, a certain William Smith [...] "of Waltham Cross, in the County of Hertford, gentleman", Streete, and twelve others took down the Theatre, carried all the wood and timber across the River Thames and built it again there. This new theatre was renamed the Globe. It opened by September 1599. (The Chamberlain's Men, in the interim, appear to have performed at the Curtain Theatre in Shoreditch).|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} method of roof framing {{employed}} by Australian builders in modern construction {{is the use}} of pre-fabricated nail plated timber roof trusses. These trusses are predominantly manufactured from structural <b>framing</b> <b>timber</b> limited in length to a maximum of 6 metres. The style and size of houses increasingly preferred by Australian homeowners means that trusses are regularly required to span further than 6 metres. Truss manufacturers therefore use larger or additional nail plates to splice members during fabrication, and the assembly process becomes far more complex. Finger jointing of sawmill off-cuts and other short lengths of timber is a means of manufacturers economically producing timber in longer lengths. This dissertation investigates the suitability of using finger jointed structural timber for the fabrication of nail plated roof trusses. Physical testing and statistical analysis has been used to compare the performance of finger jointed structural timber with standard structural <b>framing</b> <b>timber</b> normally used in truss fabrication. This study involved characterizing the mechanical properties of the timber, as well as assessing the performance of joints including mechanical fasteners. These methods, along with the static modelling of loading situations, were also used to quantify the probability of inducing failures unique to finger jointed timber, during the truss fabrication and erection process. These investigations concluded that finger jointed timber could be produced with equivalent mechanical properties to standard <b>framing</b> <b>timber.</b> Joints manufactured from finger jointed and solid structural timber also exhibited no significant difference in performance. Furthermore, failures unique to finger jointed timber could occur during fabrication and erection, however, the probability of these, under normal use conditions, is generally quite low. ...|$|E

Twist was most strongly related to log diameter, with corewood portion and spiral grain being the contributory factors. Twist also increased with log height class. Gauging halved the incidence of twist rejection. The relationship between corewood proportion and twist and its effect on rejection could be incorporated into current stand growth models, thereby extending the profitability modelling capability of models from green sawn timber through to the final dry product...|$|E

40|$|Whether or not {{termites}} initiate {{damage to}} timber via the end grain may determine {{the need for}} spot-treating the exposed untreated cut ends of envelope-treated softwood framing material. Australian Coptotermes acinaciformis (Froggatt) were field-tested {{for their ability to}} initiate feeding via the end grain of timber (35 × 90 mm) treated with a repellent Tanalith® T envelope. Specimens of commercial radiata pine Pinus radiata D. Don <b>framing</b> <b>timber</b> (untreated) and slash pine Pinus elliottii Englem. (untreated and envelope-treated) were partially clad in fine stainless steel mesh. Clad and unclad specimens were exposed to C. acinaciformis near Townsville, North Queensland, Australia, for four months. Results showed that this species of termite can indeed damage timber via the end grain, including exposed untreated cut ends of envelope-treated material as demonstrated earlier for different populations of C. acinaciformis. Differences between the test conditions in field trials carried out at different times (where C. acinaciformis either did or did not damage timber via the end grain) are discussed. Clearly, outcomes from field studies with preservative-treated materials are dependent upon experimental conditions. Notably, the amount of bait wood (highly termite-susceptible timber substrate) offered in a given method can strongly influence the termite response. Further investigation is required to standardise this aspect of conditions in protocols for the assessment of wood preservatives...|$|E
40|$|Leaky {{buildings}} {{are those that}} show elevated moisture contents of the <b>framing</b> <b>timber,</b> which can subsequently lead {{to the establishment of}} fungal and bacterial decay. Prior to this study, the causative agents of the decay in these leaky buildings were unknown, though it was suspected to be one or more species of decay fungi. Therefore, the overall goal of this multi-disciplinary PhD thesis research was to determine the causative agents of decay in leaky buildings of New Zealand in an effort to develop solutions for both their remediation and future prevention. Use of molecular biology methodology and classical mycological techniques based on morphology enabled identification of decay fungi from <b>framing</b> <b>timber</b> and air samples of leaky New Zealand buildings and provided insight into relative importance based on isolation frequency. In most cases, fungi colonising Pinus radiata D. Don were isolated to produce pure cultures. Mycelia from these cultures on agar media were collected to extract DNA. To identify the fungi to the species level, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) with fungal specific DNA primer pairs were performed followed by DNA sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region. Identification was by BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool) search on sequences in known GenBanks. In total, 421 samples from leaky buildings were processed, predominately untreated P. radiata decayed <b>framing</b> <b>timber</b> and also fibre cement boards and building paper. From these, sixty-eight fungal identifications were made. The only taxa that were isolated with significant frequency were identified as 4 basidiomycete species, as follows, along with the number of times they were isolated from the 421 samples: •	Gloeophyllum sepiarium (Wulf. : Fr.) Karst. 			 13 x •	Oligoporus placenta (Fries 1865) Gilb. In Ryv. 1985 		 11 x •	Antrodia sinuosa (Fr.) Karst. 			 		 8 x •	Gloeophyllum trabeum (Fr.) Murr. 		 		 4 x Although these species were identified repeatedly, in total they represent less than 10 % of the total samples and, therefore, it is concluded that the leaky building decay samples represent high fungal biodiversity. An aerial spore study of internal air, wall cavity air and exterior air of leaky buildings was carried out using a Merck MAS- 100 instrument which collects spores directly onto selective media plates. Viable fungal aerial spores were detected at every sampling location tested at the leaky buildings, by the criteria of culturing, with a highest mean of 3714 colony-forming units (CFU) per cubic metre found in the cavities of water-damaged walls. This aerial spore study in conjunction with isolation from decayed wood samples from the same leaky buildings enabled identification of G. sepiarium and A. sinuosa at the same test site. The use of carboxymethylcellulose medium further demonstrated the presence of potential cellulose-degrading fungi within and around the location. Overall, the combination of direct sampling of timber and air sampling proved useful for detection of fungal species variability at a multi-unit building. Four decay fungi isolated from New Zealand leaky buildings and two standard control decay fungi (Coniophora puteana and Serpula lacrymans) were submitted to laboratory wood block testing to determine the effectiveness of currently used wood framing preservatives under laboratory conditions before and after a standard leaching regime. P. radiata blocks were treated with water based boron copper azole and solvent based IPBC propiconazole plus tebuconazole (1 : 1) preservatives and exposed to the basidiomycetes for 12 weeks. Mass loss for the fungal decay-infected samples was recorded of up to 55 % for preservative-treated samples, up to 62 % mass loss for leached samples and up to 58 % mass loss for un-preservative treated samples. Additionally, well defined dosage responses and approximate toxic thresholds were obtained for all preservatives tested. Results suggested that the minimum IPBC retention specified by Hazard Class 1. 2 of NZS 3640 : 2003 (0. 025 % m/m) is on the low side, and demonstrated after the 2 week leaching regime complete loss of efficacy of boron at 0. 4 % m/m boric acid equivalent (BAE). This PhD research gave a first overview of fungi occurring in New Zealand leaky buildings, and it demonstrated the following key aspects of wood preservation: 1. 	The isolated test fungus Antrodia sinuosa was more difficult to control with propiconazole plus tebuconazole at retention 0. 007 % m/m than the known tolerant fungus Oligoporus placenta; 2. 	Boron at Hazard Class 1. 2 retention of 0. 4 % m/m BAE was not toxic to Oligoporus placenta; 3. 	Serpula lacrymans exhibited tolerance to the highest retention of 0. 06 %m/m tebuconazole plus propiconazole; and 4. 	Gloeophyllum species appeared susceptible to all wood preservatives. In order to correlate fungal colonisation and wood decay, colonised wood blocks were studied using light microscopy (LM) and field- emission scanning electron microscopy (FE-SEM). Microscopic observations of P. radiata wood blocks following a standard wood decay test of twelve weeks of fungal colonisation by Serpula lacrymans, Antrodia sinuosa, Oligoporus placenta and Gloeophyllum sepiarium revealed that the two microscopic techniques employed were complementary by allowing features such as pit membranes, chlamydospores or S 3 /S 2 compound middle lamella interface to be photographed in greater detail, allowing for more precise analyses and interpretation of key findings, as follows: 1. 	Brown rot fungi directly target their apical growth towards degraded pit apetures; 2. 	Reliance on light microscopy and observed birefringence as a tool to record changes in cell wall crystallinity associated with brown rot decay alone could be misleading; 3. 	Presence of fine (≤ 1 m) to wide (≥ 3. 5 m) bore-hole and hyphal size ranges, and nearly unchanged cell wall thickness of all wood/test fungal combinations, confirmed active decay at moderate to late stages; 4. 	Some ray parenchyma cells for Antrodia sinuosa, Oligoporus placenta and Gloeophyllum sepiarium colonised blocks were intact throughout late stages of decay, outlining that they were not preferentially degraded early in the brown rot decay process, and 5. 	Presence of bore-holes, clamp and medallion clamp formation and resting spores (chlamydospores and arthrospores) are fungal specific, can aid in their differentiation and identification, and should be recorded during wood decay studies, as especially resting spores are an important factor when planning remediation strategies. In summary, this PhD thesis research provided the first comprehensive investigation into the biodiversity of fungi from leaky New Zealand buildings, identified the dominant species and presented details about their micromorphology and their decay patterns. It also demonstrated substantial differences in efficacy of preservative formulations currently (December 2008) approved for framing treatments in New Zealand and possible deficiencies where framing may be subjected to severe leaching. This study also provided the first comparative analyses of viable fungal aerial spores between leaky wall cavities and the surrounding air environment. Subsequently, this research added to the knowledge of the decay fungal species diversity in and around New Zealand leaky buildings, outlined their capabilities to degrade treated and un-treated P. radiata <b>framing</b> <b>timber</b> and illustrated the efficacy of New Zealand approved wood preservatives for their potential as remedial treatment and future prevention...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the within- and between-tree variations in the physical and mechanical properties of Pinus radiata (radiata pine). Forty eight trees from a 25 -year-old plantation on the Canterbury plains near Dunsandel in the South Island of New Zealand were felled and cross-cut to give three 3. 6 meter logs. Each log was identified by tree number and position up the height of the tree (butt, middle and top log). At the sawmill the logs were sawn, first by removing 40 mm thick slices known as flitches from opposite sides of the trunk until a 100 mm thick plank known as a cant was left at the centre. The flitches were re-cut at the breast bench circular saw to yield timbers of nominal dimensions 100 x 40 mm. In re-cutting the 100 mm wide cant gave 3 - 5 boards depending on the diameter of the log. The position of every board was recorded relative to the pith and numbered. A total of 915 boards from the 48 trees (144 logs) were obtained. The boards were filleted (i. e. stacked with uniform and sufficient spacing between each layer both in the vertical and horizontal directions so as to ease air circulation) and air-dried to approximately 12 % moisture content. After drying the boards were dressed to 90 x 35 mm and grouped into. one of the four Australian structural grades (F 4, F 5, F 8 and F 11) as each board passed through a stress grading machine. The modulus of elasticity of the boards was measured both in flatwise bending and axial tension. The strength of the boards was determined by destructive testing in tension and compression parallel to the grain. After failure in tension short clear planks (i. e. planks with no knots and any other natural defects) were cut from each board. From these short planks small clear specimens were prepared for the determination of stiffness, bending strength and compression strength parallel to the grain. The investigation of density, stiffness and strength in relation to the vertical and radial positions within a tree revealed that there is a significant variation in all properties with changes in radial positions across the diameter, and a significant variation in strength properties, but not stiffness with change in vertical position up the height of the tree. Regarding between-tree variation, all properties changed significantly. With reference to the production of structural <b>framing</b> <b>timber,</b> stiffness and density were compared as criteria for sorting trees and identifying superior material within logs. This analysis revealed that stiffness is a better criterion for selecting superior trees within the natural population of a forest stand, to improve the value of mill production and to achieve a better outturn in higher value grades (F 5 and above). A regression analysis between the properties of the in-grade timber and clearwood showed that there is a very strong relationship between the modulus of elasticity of clearwood and that of the in-grade timber. As expected there was a general decrease in strength and stiffness of the graded timber as the grade value decreased from F 11 to F 4. Strength and stiffness values in tension, bending and compression have been compared with the current New Zealand, Australian and European code design values, generally giving good recovery of higher value grades (F 5 and above), especially for strength...|$|E
