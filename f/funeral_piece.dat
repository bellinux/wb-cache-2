Apart from {{that and a}} <b>funeral</b> <b>piece</b> from 1648, other possible attributions may have been confused with the works of Johann Heinrich Hildebrand, the Kantor at Ohrdruf; and it remains uncertain who wrote them.|$|E

50|$|Southeast of {{the former}} {{location}} of Taft's studio is the 1905 sculpture The <b>Funeral</b> Procession. The <b>piece</b> was the collaborative work of six of Taft's students who had taken up residence at the colony for the summer. The assignment required each student to create a human figure but left {{the subject of the}} sculpture to their collective choice. The end result is a piece with six human figures carrying a casket on their shoulders.|$|R
5000|$|According to {{a report}} in The Guardian:Such was the popular mood (remember the queues across the bridges near Westminster Abbey) that the words of the poem, so plain as {{scarcely}} to be poetic, seemed to strike a chord. Not since Audens Stop All the Clocks in the film Four Weddings and a <b>Funeral</b> had a <b>piece</b> of funerary verse made such an impression on the nation. In the days immediately after the service, there was frantic correspondence and speculation about the poems possible provenance. [...] "Systems crashed and telephone lines were blocked at the Times," [...] reported columnist Philip Howard, and the lines were attributed variously to Immanuel Kant, Joyce Grenfell and nameless Native Americans. [...] "Anon" [...] seemed the best bet.|$|R
500|$|In 1969, COBRA revised their {{philosophy}} and artistic concept {{to expand their}} concern for black liberation and civil rights on an international level. Inspired by the words of Malcolm X, [...] "All black people, regardless of their land base, have the same problems, the control of their land and economics by Europeans or Euro-Americans.", they changed their name to AfriCOBRA: African Commune of Bad Relevant Artists. [...] Jarrell's work had evolved to bring the focus figure to the foreground of his paintings, as seen in Coolade Lester (1970), a portrait of musician Lester Lashley. Letters make another appearance: D (down), B (black), F (fine) and Q (question). The work {{is described as a}} [...] "humanistic portrayal of the genius of Africans in the creation of jazz." [...] Other works by Jarrell at the time became politically and socially charged with the aesthetics put forth by AfriCOBRA. Homage to a Giant (1970) is Jarrell's first tribute to MalcolmX. This work is used by Jarrell to speak for the black struggle against oppression and the death of student protestors fighting for that cause. Four images of Malcolm X are painted alongside those of Huey Newton, Jesse Jackson and Stokley Carmichael. [...] "B" [...] makes its usual appearance representing [...] "blackness" [...] and [...] "badness" [...] as well as a quote from Ossie Davis's eulogy at Malcolm's <b>funeral.</b> This <b>piece,</b> along with Coolade Lester, appeared in AFRI-COBRA's first exhibition in 1970 at the Studio Museum in Harlem: [...] "AFRI-COBRA I: Ten in Search of a Nation." [...] The response to the show was one of misunderstanding by many viewers, with the result that the concepts presented were interpreted as [...] "protest art." ...|$|R
5000|$|As {{with his}} {{previously}} abandoned projects, Bernstein used {{portions of the}} score in subsequent works. In Songfest, for example, the setting of Walt Whitman's poem [...] "To What You Said" [...] as a baritone solo was a reworking of the original prelude of the show, in which the chorus hummed a melody played by the violoncello in the Songfest version. (In the show, this music {{was moved to the}} emotional low point of the second act, used as background to a Presidential <b>funeral.)</b> The occasional <b>piece</b> Slava! A Political Overture, written in honor of Bernstein's friend Mstislav Rostropovich, blended two numbers from the show, the up-tempo [...] "Rehearse!" [...] and [...] "The Grand Old Party." [...] Early in the opera A Quiet Place, the music for the aria [...] "You're late, you shouldn't have come" [...] derives from that of [...] "Me," [...] a song that in the original show established the meta-theatrical concept that was eventually abandoned. (Some of the music for [...] "Me" [...] can be heard in the Broadway score, most memorably in the song [...] "American Dreaming.") An instrumental section of [...] "The President Jefferson March" [...] was reused in the final movement, [...] "In Memoriam and March: The BSO Forever," [...] of the Divertimento.|$|R
500|$|The Britten scholar Donald Mitchell has written, [...] "It is easy, {{because of}} the scope, stature, and sheer volume of the operas, and the wealth of vocal music of all kinds, to pay {{insufficient}} attention to the many works Britten wrote in other, specifically non-vocal genres." [...] Maw said of Britten, [...] "He {{is one of the}} 20th century's great orchestral composers... His orchestration has an individuality, incisiveness and integration with the musical material only achieved by the greatest composers." [...] Among Britten's best-known orchestral works are the Variations on a Theme of Frank Bridge (1937), the Sinfonia da Requiem (1940), the Four Sea Interludes (1945) and The Young Person's Guide to the Orchestra (1945). The Variations, an affectionate tribute to Britten's teacher, range from comic parodies of Italian operatic clichés and Viennese waltzes to a strutting march, reflecting the rise of militarism in Europe, and a Mahlerian <b>funeral</b> march; the <b>piece</b> ends with an exuberant fugal finale. The Sinfonia moves from an opening Lacrymosa filled with fear and lamentation to a fierce Dies irae and then to a final Requiem aeternam, described by the critic Herbert Glass as [...] "the most uneasy 'eternal rest' possible". Mason considers the Sinfonia a failure: [...] "less entertaining than usual, because its object is not principally to entertain but to express symphonically. It fails because it is neither picturesquely nor formally symphonic". The Sea Interludes, adapted by Britten from the full score of Peter Grimes, make a concert suite depicting the sea and the Borough in which the opera is set; the character of the music is strongly contrasted between [...] "Dawn", [...] "Sunday Morning", [...] "Moonlight" [...] and [...] "Storm". The commentator Howard Posner observes {{that there is not a}} bar in the interludes, no matter how beautiful, that is free of foreboding. The Young Person's Guide, based on a theme by Purcell, showcases the orchestra's individual sections and groups, and gained widespread popularity from the outset. Christopher Headington calls the work [...] "exuberant and uncomplicated music, scored with clarity and vigour [...] fits well into Britten's oeuvre." [...] David Matthews calls it [...] "a brilliant educational exercise." ...|$|R
