The objective of the new Order is to strengthen the department’s management of its radioactive waste and to clarify requirements in accordance with its authority under the Atomic Energy Act of 1954. As a result, several new and modified requirements have been included in DOE O 435. 1. The Order has been supplemented by a Manual containing specific requirements, Technical Bases for the requirements, and Guidance on how the requirement could or should be implemented. The intent of this paper will be to describe Savannah River Site's (SRS) role in developing the requirements, estimating the cost of implementation, and identifying issues associated with the new and modified requirements.

40|$|Abstract. We {{examine the}} problem of verifying MPI {{programs}} {{for the absence of}} deadlocks and local assertion violations through dynamic (runtime) formal verication in which the processes of a given MPI pro-gram are executed under the control of an interleaving scheduler. The development of such an algorithm requires several challenges to be over-come in ensuring full coverage (as opposed to a testing tool that can miss bugs) : (i) The algorithm must take into consideration MPI's out-of-order completion semantics (that is, MPI operations need not nish in the <b>issue</b> <b>order),</b> and (ii) the algorithm must ensure that MPI wildcard receive matches are considered in all possible ways. Our new algorithm is based on the following novel ideas. First, it rewrites wildcard receives to speci c receives, one for each sender that can potentially match with the receive. It then recursively explores each case of the specic receives. The list of potential senders matching a receive is determined through a run-time algorithm that exploits MPI's operational ordering semantics. Our veri cation tool ISP that incorporates this algorithm eciently veries several programs and nds bugs in many cases where existing dynamic informal verication tools may miss them. ...|$|E

The legal part described: the building's legal regulation, principal demands {{of the building and}} architecture, main documents required for the construction of the building and their <b>issue</b> <b>order,</b> technical maintenance, construction participants and their activities. The architectural part presented collective data about the building under construction and it's site. Defined: structure of the building's volume, plan and construction. Calculated: the heat transfer coefficient of roof construction. Bonded wood beam is calculated and designed. Four swimming pool shell roof bearing structures and coating selection versions are created in the research part. Criteria are selected for multi-criteria evaluation, which is done by using optimization methods and afterwards one optimal version. Most rational roof constructions and roof combination is designed in the technologic part. All necessary mechanisms are selected. Technological card of this process is created. Construction site plan created in the organizational part. Crane for lifting is selected. Location of local warehouses, buildings and engineering networks are described. The economic part presented calculations of the whole building to carry out the construction and its estimated price. Health and safety requirements are described. At the end of the work, conclusions are given. Scope of work - 86 pages, 19 illustrations, 45 tables, 65 formulas and 8 drawings (in A 1 format) ...|$|E

40|$|Signalling result {{availability}} {{from the}} functional units {{to the instruction}} scheduler can increase the cycle time and/or the effective latency of the instructions. The knowledge of all instruction latencies would allow the instruction scheduler to operate without the need of external signalling. However, the latency of some instructions is unknown; but, the scheduler can optimistically predict the latency of these instructions and issue speculatively their dependent instructions. Although prediction techniques have great performance potential, their gain can vanish due to misprediction handling. For instance, holding speculatively scheduled instructions in the issue queue reduces its capacity to lookahead for independent instructions. This paper evaluates a recovery mechanism for latency mispredictions that retains the speculatively issued instructions in a structure apart from the issue queue: the recovery buffer. When data becomes available after a latency misprediction, the dependent instructions will be re-issued from the recovery buffer. Moreover, {{in order to simplify}} the reissue logic of the recovery buffer, the instructions will be recorded in <b>issue</b> <b>order.</b> On mispredictions, the recovery buffer increases the effective capacity of the issue queue to hold instructions waiting for operands. Our evaluations in integer benchmarks show that the recovery-buffer mechanism reduces issue-queue size requirements about 20 - 25 %. Also, this mechanism is less sensitive to the verification delay than the recovery mechanism that retains the instructions in the issue queue. 1...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{with only}} small {{fractions}} of modern processors now accessible {{in a single}} cycle, computer architects constantly fight against propagation issues across the die. Unfortunately this trend continues to shift inward, and now the even most internal features of the pipeline are designed around communication, not computation. To address the inward creep of this constraint, this work focuses on the characterization of communication within the pipeline itself, architectural techniques to avoid it when possible, and layout co-design for early detection of problems. I present work in creating a novel detection tool for common case operand movement which can rapidly characterize an applications dataflow patterns. The results produced are suitable for exploitation as {{a small number of}} patterns can describe a significant portion of modern applications. Work on dynamic dependence collapsing takes the observations from the pattern results and shows how certain groups of operations can be dynamically grouped, avoiding unnecessary communication between individual instructions. This technique also amplifies the efficiency of pipeline data structures such as the reorder buffer, increasing both IPC and frequency. I also identify the same sets of collapsible instructions at compile time, producing the same benefits with minimal hardware complexity. This technique is also done in a backward compatible manner as the groups are exposed by simple reordering of the binarys instructions. I present aggressive pipelining approaches for these resources which avoids the critical timing often presumed necessary in aggressive superscalar processors. As these structures are designed for the worst case, pipelining them can produce greater frequency benefit than IPC loss. I also use the observation that the dynamic <b>issue</b> <b>order</b> for instructions in aggressive superscalar processors is predictable. Thus, a hardware mechanism is introduced for caching the wakeup order for groups of instructions efficiently. These wakeup vectors are then used to speculatively schedule instructions, avoiding the dynamic scheduling when it is not necessary. Finally, I present a novel approach to fast and high-quality chip layout. By allowing architects to quickly evaluate what if scenarios during early high-level design, chip designs are less likely to encounter implementation problems later in the process. Ph. D.
