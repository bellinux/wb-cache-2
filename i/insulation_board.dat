40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} use of {{agricultural}} waste materials as alternative raw material for thermal insulation for dwellings in Thailand. A literature review carried out to study the potential of several agricultural waste materials suggested that coconut husks, bagasse and rice hulls offer high potential due to their availability in Thailand, low thermal conductivity, and ability to be made into low density boards. The Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) was carried out to compare the environmental and health impacts of thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> made from agricultural waste materials currently available on the market with conventional insulation materials. This suggested that the currently available thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> made from agricultural waste materials generally had more environmental and health impacts than conventional insulation materials. However, coconut husks and bagasse showed potential; the environmental and health impacts of the <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> made from these materials were low and could be lower provided that they were produced with lower thermal conductivity and lower density and without chemical binder. Low-density binderless thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> were then developed from coconut husks and bagasse using a hot pressing method with varying hot pressing conditions. The results showed that board density, hot pressing temperature and pressing time {{were associated with the}} physical properties of both coconut husk and bagasse <b>insulation</b> <b>boards,</b> including modulus of rupture, modulus of elasticity and internal bond. It was also found that while both binderless coconut and bagasse <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> had thermal conductivity values in the same range as those of conventional insulation materials, the binderless bagasse <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> had better mechanical properties than coconut <b>boards.</b> Binderless bagasse <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> produced at a density of 350 kg/m 3 treated at a hot pressing temperature of 200 °C for 13 min could satisfy the requirements of JIS A 5905 : 2003 Insulation Fibreboards except for thickness swelling. LCA was carried out for two potential bagasse <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> (350 and 230 kg/m 3 density) in comparison with conventional insulation materials. The results suggested that a board of 230 kg/m 3 density offers lower environmental impacts than cellulose, fibreglass and rock wool insulations. The outcome of this study indicates that bagasse, an agricultural waste material, has significant potential as alternative raw material for thermal insulation production in the context of Thailand.

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to study physical, mechanical and thermal properties of <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> prepared from narrow-leaved cattail fibers by using Methylene Diphenyl Diisocyanate (MDI) as a binder. Hot pressing was employed to produce single layered plain thermal <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> with the size 350 x 350 x 10 mm. The physical, mechanical and thermal properties of the boards were investigated. The test results showed that the <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> from narrow-leaved cattail fibers had good physical and mechanical properties tested according to the standard of TIS. 876 - 2547. Thermal conductivity measured in accordance with the ASTM C 518 revealed that the board with a density of 200 - 400 kg/m 3 had the thermal conductivity values ranging from 0. 0438 - 0. 0606 W/m K, which was less than that of fibrous materials and cellular materials, such as low-density wheat straw board, particleboard from mixture of durian peel and coconut coir, kenaf binderless board, expanded perlite and vermiculite with the same density range. According to the test results, it can be concluded that this <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> from narrow-leaved cattail fibers were an excellent insulating component for energy saving and environmentally friendly. Additionally, these <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> could be used to produce furniture with an advantage to help, and get rid of weeds...|$|R

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with wind tunnel tests of two protected membrane roofing systems in which <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> are loosely laid over the water-impermeable membrane.

His paintings from that period are often created through a performative process in which Stingel covers the entire floor of his studio with Styrofoam and then walks across the thick surface in boots dipped in lacquer thinner. The Styrofoam melts with each of Stingel’s steps leaving behind only the markings of a footprint. The final work is then arranged in single, double or as in this case a monumentous four panels taken from the much larger field of panels that covered the entire studio floor.|$|E

50|$|Particle {{board is}} cheaper, denser and more uniform than {{conventional}} wood and plywood and is substituted {{for them when}} cost {{is more important than}} strength and appearance. However, particleboard can be made more attractive by painting or the use of wood veneers onto surfaces that will be visible. Though it is denser than conventional wood, it is the lightest and weakest type of fiberboard, except for <b>insulation</b> <b>board.</b> Medium-density fibreboard and hardboard, also called high-density fiberboard, are stronger and denser than particleboard. Different grades of particleboard have different densities, with higher density connoting greater strength and greater resistance to failure of screw fasteners.|$|E
50|$|More recently, {{systems have}} become {{available}} that allow plasterboard or <b>insulation</b> <b>board</b> {{to be used}} to replaster walls affected by rising damp. After the existing plaster has been hacked off the wall, a salt and moisture retardant cream is applied to the wall. The plasterboard is then applied to the wall using a salt/moisture-proof adhesive. Such systems have the advantage that they can be decorated straight away, rather than having to wait several days or weeks (as would be the case with standard plasters). They also provide a warmer surface that is less prone to condensation than would be the case with a standard sand:cement render.|$|E

Over 8,000m2 of rigid <b>insulation</b> <b>board</b> by Kingspan was used to reduce heat loss.The skyscraper's curtain wall structure is clad in glass and elements were added to counter excessive light. Louvres on south-facing windows allow for the control of daylight and sunlight into its interior. On the west and east-facing sides, aluminium strips which are noticeable from ground level project outwards to provide shading from the sun. The louvres on the south façade alter its consistency and appearance when some are open and others are closed. They stop excessive passive solar gain.

40|$|Green roofs are {{becoming}} more and more popular because their thermal inertia, combined with latent heat effects, saves energy both in summer and winter and helps improve the microclimate in cities. Due to a multitude of influencing factors like moisture storage, freezing, evaporation, shading, reduced radiation absorption through the plant cover, etc., a simulation of the hygrothermal behavior of green roofs is still difficult. In Germany, green roofs are often applied on so-called inverted roofs, where a vapor-retarding foam insulation is used above the roofing membrane in direct contact with the growth medium. Due to a more or less permanent moisture film beneath the insulation panels and a mostly moisture-saturated growth medium above, these <b>insulation</b> <b>boards</b> experience a continuous moisture accumulation during their service life. In numerous in-situ investigations of inverted green roofs, the accumulation of moisture was determined by periodical probing over a period of 10 years. Temperature and humidity sensors at several positions in the roofs served to monitor the transient behavior. Based on these tests, new models for the hygrothermal performance of inverted green roofs have been developed to simulate the moisture behavior of the foam <b>insulation</b> <b>boards,</b> depending on material properties and boundary conditions. Together with further experimental investigations, this model allows a detailed analysis of the longterm hygrothermal and energy performance of green roofs...|$|R
