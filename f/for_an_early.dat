5|$|On April 14, 1848, Abovian {{left his}} home <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> morning walk, {{and was never}} seen again; his {{disappearance}} remains unresolved. His wife Emilia did not report him missing for a month. Their children, Vartan (1840–1896) and Zarmandukht (later known as Adelaide; 1843–1909), were ages eight and five, respectively, {{at the time of}} the disappearance.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the Election Commission would {{review the}} postal voting system where EC {{chairman}} Tan Sri Abdul Aziz Mohd Yusof {{said they would}} study the proposal to call <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> voting session for army personnel, policemen and EC staff instead of posting votes. Nevertheless, the Youth wing of PAS have demanded for the postal votes to be abolished altogether as it claims that the postal votes are no longer relevant and is prone to abuse and exploitation {{by the government to}} their benefit.|$|E
5|$|At the school, the {{fatalities}} {{resulted from}} {{the collapse of a}} concrete block wall. One hallway completely collapsed, trapping many students in the rubble of the hallway known as 3rd Hall. The tornado at the school was so strong that it tossed and mangled cars in the parking lot, flattened parts of the stadium and tore trees out of the ground. School buses were there <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> dismissal due to the storms at just after 1:00pm, but the tornado hit before the school could be dismissed.|$|E

5|$|Becket Hill State Park Reserve {{is named}} <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> settler {{of the area}} named Beckwith; the land {{was part of the}} Nehantic tribe's territory. In 1961, the land for the reserve was given to the state by the George Dudley Seymour Trust, to become the 76th {{designated}} Connecticut state park. Beckett Hill was listed on the Connecticut Register and Manual for 1962 as having 260 acres of undeveloped land.|$|E
5|$|Brooks then {{won gold}} {{as part of}} the winning 4100m {{freestyle}} relay, anchoring the team of Fasala, Delany and Graeme Brewer to a victory by almost three seconds, putting in a split of 50.56s. The shaven-headed quartet was dubbed the Mean Machine. He collected another gold in the medley relay, combining with David Orbell, Evans and Jon Sieben, this time completing his freestyle anchor leg in 50.44s. Canada had finished the race far ahead of the Australians, but were disqualified <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> changeover. After the games, Brooks completed the American college season before returning to Australia. He was named as Western Australia's Sportsman of the Year.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea faced Greek side Olympiacos in {{the first}} {{knockout}} round. The first leg in Athens ended in a 0–0 draw, but a 3–0 win in the second leg, with goals from Michael Ballack, Frank Lampard and Salomon Kalou, saw Chelsea through to the quarter-finals. There, they were drawn against Fenerbahçe of Turkey. The first leg {{was held at the}} Şükrü Saracoğlu Stadium in Istanbul, and ended in a 2–1 defeat, as Deivid made up <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> own goal by scoring the winner nine minutes from time after Colin Kazim-Richards' equaliser. Chelsea won the second leg at Stamford Bridge 2–0, with goals from Ballack and Lampard, to claim a 3–2 aggregate victory over the Turkish side.|$|E

5|$|Cinefantastiques Dale Kutzera {{thought the}} episode flowed well, {{and that the}} treknobabble was {{reasonable}} and logical, but that the episode didn't {{make good use of}} the characters. He said that each character fitted a certain role: Neelix was the jealous boyfriend, B'Elanna Torres (Roxann Dawson) was the shoot-first Klingon, and Kes was the perky-looking alien sounding board for other characters. Furthermore, Kutzera felt that the themes of the episode were more appropriate <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> first-season episode, not being as pertinent or believable a year later. He gave the episode 2.5 out of 4 stars.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lee's hope <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> start, it {{took all}} morning to arrange the {{infantry}} assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or a mistake. Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this failure as evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.|$|E
5|$|Following Williams's {{death in}} 1996, curator Roslyn Walker, served as {{director}} from 1997 through her 2002 retirement. Walker continued {{the direction of}} her predecessor and added a dedicated contemporary art gallery and curator. She also created a development office, which raised money <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> 2000s renovation of the museum's pavilion. Sharon Patton, former director of Oberlin College's Allen Memorial Art Museum, served as director between 2003 and 2008. Her tenure included more shows targeting children and an advisory board mass resignation over Smithsonian leadership.|$|E

5|$|German air {{doctrine}} {{had seen}} little {{need for the}} development of an nocturnal night air defence system and the Luftwaffe concentrated on the offensive use of air power. However, the failure of the Luftwaffe in the Battle of Britain in 1940 ended hopes <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> victory and forced the continuance of hostilities with the British Empire. Faced with German domination of the continent, the only weapon the British could use to exert immediate military pressure on Germany was the night bombing operations of RAF Bomber Command.|$|E
5|$|In {{their annual}} rivalry game, Alabama {{defeated}} the Mississippi State Bulldogs 20–7 at Starkville despite having four turnovers. Alabama won the coin toss and elected {{to receive the}} ball to start the game. They then scored on a 33-yard Cade Foster field goal <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> 3–0 lead. Both teams then traded punts for their next six combined possessions before the Bulldogs missed a 23-yard field goal midway through the second quarter. On the Alabama drive that ensued, the Crimson Tide had their first of four turnovers on a Taveze Calhoun interception of an AJ McCarron pass. Alabama rebounded on their next possession with an 18-yard touchdown pass from McCarron to Brian Vogler that made the halftime score 10–0.|$|E

5|$|Millhouse, now the State Parliamentary Leader of the LM, {{announced}} the LM's {{policy for the}} 1975 state election at the Adelaide Town Hall on 2 July. He outlined the LM's plans for economic rejuvenation: an end to compulsory unionism, budget and tax cuts, and measures to curb rising inflation and cost of living. Social policy included proposals <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> form of multiculturalism and promotion of 'cultural diversity' and bilingualism. Energy policy appealed {{to a new generation}} of environmentalists, and promoted conservation and promotion of solar power. He slammed the proposed City of Monarto as a 'monument to socialist folly'.|$|E
5|$|In Alabama's {{first trip}} to Lexington since 2004, and their first road game of the 2009 season, the Tide {{defeated}} the Kentucky Wildcats 38–20. Alabama scored on their opening drive after Javier Arenas returned the opening kickoff 60 yards, which set up an 11-yard Mark Ingram touchdown <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> 7–0 lead. Kentucky responded {{with a pair of}} 49-yard Lones Seiber field goals. The score was 7–6 {{at the end of the}} first quarter. The Tide extended their lead late in the second quarter following a nearly seven-minute, 13-play, 97-yard touchdown drive. Greg McElroy passes of 27 and 21 yards and a 13-yard run by Ingram moved Bama down the field, culminating with a three-yard touchdown pass from McElroy to Colin Peek to put the Tide up 14–6. With only 40 seconds remaining in the half, Kentucky tailback Derrick Locke fumbled the ball after catching a short pass. Courtney Upshaw returned 45 yards for an Alabama touchdown that put the Tide ahead 21–6 at halftime.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} their first meeting since Alabama {{defeated}} the Tigers 38–28 during the 1978 season, and their first as conference foes, Alabama won 42–10 at Missouri on a stormy afternoon. The Crimson Tide opened the scoring on their second offensive play when Eddie Lacy had a 73-yard touchdown run <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> 7–0 Alabama lead. After each team traded punts, Vinnie Sunseri intercepted a Corbin Berkstresser pass that set up Alabama's second scoring drive from the 50-yard line. AJ McCarron first had a 44-yard completion to Kenny Bell, and then Lacy scored his second touchdown of the afternoon on a three-yard run two plays later for a 14–0 lead. The third Crimson Tide touchdown {{of the first quarter}} was set up after Landon Collins blocked a Trey Barrow punt that was recovered at the Missouri 17-yard line. Three T. J. Yeldon runs later, Alabama led 21–0.|$|E

5|$|On 14 April 1471, {{at around}} 4o'clock in the morning, both armies woke. Edward had planned <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> attack, however, and quickly roused {{his men to}} engage the Lancastrians. Both sides fired their cannon and arrows before laying into each other with polearms. The morning fog was thick and the night {{movements}} of the two forces had displaced them laterally with each other. Neither group was facing the other; each was offset slightly to the right. This displacement meant that the right end of either army could outflank the other by wrapping around the opposing left end. The Lancastrians {{were the first to}} exploit this advantage; Oxford's group quickly overwhelmed Hastings'. Yorkist soldiers fled towards Barnet, chased by the Lancastrians. Some of Hastings' men even reached London, spreading tales of the fall of York and a Lancastrian victory. Oxford's group disintegrated as they split off to loot the fallen enemies and plunder Barnet. Yelling and chasing after his men, Oxford rallied 800 of them and led them back to the battle.|$|E
5|$|The final {{demobilisation}} plan assigned differing {{scales of}} points for service men and women. Service men were allocated two points {{for each year}} of age based on their age at enlistment and a further two points for each month of service {{if they did not}} have dependent children or three points if they did. Service women received three points for each year of age at enlistment and a point for each month of service. Women with children were given priority for demobilisation, followed by those who had married {{before the end of the}} war. Service women who married after the war could ask <b>for</b> <b>an</b> <b>early</b> discharge on compassionate grounds. Men were also eligible for early discharge on compassionate or health grounds, if they had skills which were important to the Australian economy or had been accepted into a full-time training course.|$|E
