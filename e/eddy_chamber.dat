40|$|Accurate {{estimates}} of annual budgets of methane (CH 4 ) efflux in arctic regions are severely {{constrained by the}} paucity of non-summer measurements. Moreover, the incomplete understanding of the ecosystem-level sensitivity of CH 4 emissions to changes in tundra moisture makes prediction of future CH 4 release from the Arctic extremely difficult. This study addresses some of these research gaps by presenting an analysis of <b>eddy</b> covariance and <b>chamber</b> measurements of CH 4 efflux and supporting environmental variables during the autumn season and associated beginning of soil freeze-up at our large-scale water manipulation site near Barrow, Alaska (the Biocomplexity Experiment). We found that the autumn season CH 4 emission is significant (accounting for 21 – 25 % of the average growing season emission), and that this emission is mostly controlled by the fraction of inundated landscape, atmospheric turbulence, and the decline in unfrozen water {{during the period of}} soil freezing. Drainage decreased autumn CH 4 emission by a factor of 2. 4 compared to our flooded treatment. Flooding slowed the soil freezing process which has implications for extending elevated CH 4 emissions longer into the winter season...|$|R

40|$|Light Source Note LS- 176 lists {{four types}} of {{corrector}} magnets and their power supply specifications. In order to simplify the AC operation of corrector magnets for closed orbit correction feedback, adopting a single type of corrector magnet for the whole ring is currently considered. This corrector magnet has six poles (an adaption from the ring sextupole magnet) and has coil windings producing independent horizontal and vertical bending fields. As in the other correctors, the vacuum <b>chamber</b> <b>eddy</b> current dominates the AC operation of the magnet which affects the voltage specification of the power supplies. In this note, the physical requirements of the magnets will be reviewed, and the relevant magnet and power supply parameters will be reported. A few assumptions on the local bump geometries have changed {{since the publication of}} LS- 176. The inner correctors of the straight section bump have been moved about 0. 15 m inwards to conform with current vacuum chamber design. This decreases the required magnet strengths by 15 % relative to those in LS- 176. As of the publication date of this report, the locations of the two outboard correctors of the straight section bump are set midway between the quadrupoles Ql and Q 2. Moving these correctors closer to the Q 2 `s will further reduce the corrector strength required. Therefore, two results are presented: one with the two outward correctors remaining at their current design locations, and one with the outward correctors moved right up against quadrupole Q 2. Also, the parameters for the bending magnet beamline bump are recalculated for a photon source placed 1 / 8 th downstream of the entrance of the magnet...|$|R
40|$|The {{turbulent}} {{exchanges of}} CO 2 and water vapour between an aggrading deciduous {{forest in the}} north-eastern United States (Harvard Forest) and the atmosphere were measured from 1990 to 1994 using the eddy covariance technique. We present {{a detailed description of}} the methods used and a rigorous evaluation of the precision and accuracy of these measurements. We partition the sources of error into three categories: (1) uniform systematic errors are constant and independent of measurement conditions (2) selective systematic errors result when the accuracy of the exchange measurement varies as a function of the physical environment, and (3) sampling uncertainty results when summing an incomplete data set to calculate long-term exchange. Analysis of the surface energy budget indicates a uniform systematic error in the turbulent exchange measurements of - 20 to 0 %. A comparison of nocturnal <b>eddy</b> flux with <b>chamber</b> measurements indicates a selective systematic underestimation during calm (friction velocity < 0. 17 m s - 1) nocturnal periods. We describe an approach to correct for this error. The integrated carbon sequestration in 1994 was 2. 1 t C ha - 1 y - 1 with a 90 % confidence interval due to sampling uncertainty of ± 0. 3 t C ha - 1 y - 1 determined by Monte Carlo simulation. Sampling uncertainty may be reduced by estimating the flux as a function of the physical environment during periods when direct observations are unavailable, and by minimizing the length of intervals without flux data. These analyses lead us to place an overall uncertainty on the annual carbon sequestration in 1994 of - 0. 3 to + 0. 8 t C ha - 1 y - 1. © 1996 Blackwell Science Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Time {{series of}} {{satellite}} sensor-derived {{data can be}} used in the light use efficiency (LUE) model for gross primary productivity (GPP). The LUE model and a closely related linear regression model were studied at an ombrotrophic peatland in southern Sweden. <b>Eddy</b> covariance and <b>chamber</b> GPP, incoming and reflected photosynthetic photon flux density (PPFD), field-measured spectral reflectance, and data from the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) were used in this study. The chamber and spectral reflectance measurements were made on four experimental treatments: unfertilized control (Ctrl). nitrogen fertilized (N), phosphorus fertilized (P), and nitrogen plus phosphorus fertilized (NP). For Ctrl, a strong linear relationship was found between GPP and the photosynthetically active radiation absorbed by vegetation (APAR) (R- 2 = 0. 90). The slope coefficient (epsilon(s), where s stands for "slope") for the linear relationship between seasonal time series of GPP and the product of the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) and PPFD was used as a proxy for the light use efficiency factor (epsilon). There were differences in epsilon(s) depending on the treatments with a significant effect for N compared to Ctrl (ANOVA: p = 0. 042, Tukey's: p <= 0. 05). Also. epsilon(s) was linearly related to the cover degree of vascular plants (R- 2 = 0. 66). As a sensitivity test, the regression coefficients (epsilon(s) and intercept) for each treatment were used to model time series of 16 -day GPP from the product of MODIS NDVI and PPFD. Seasonal averages of GPP were calculated for 2005, 2006. and 2007, which resulted in up to 19 % higher average GPP for the fertilization treatments compared to Ctrl. The main conclusion is that the LUE model and the regression model can be applied in peatlands but also that temporal and spatial changes in epsilon or the regression coefficients should be considered.

40|$|Micrometeorological {{measurements}} of night time ecosystem respiration can be systematically biased when stable atmospheric conditions lead to drainage flows associated with decoupling of air flow above and within plant canopies. The associated {{horizontal and vertical}} advective fluxes cannot be measured using instrumentation on the single towers typically used at micrometeorological sites. A common approach to minimize bias {{is to use a}} threshold in friction velocity, u*, to exclude periods when advection is assumed to be important, but this is problematic in situations when in-canopy flows are decoupled from the flow above. Using data from 25 flux stations {{in a wide variety of}} forest ecosystems globally, we examine the generality of a novel approach to estimating nocturnal respiration developed by van Gorsel et al. (van Gorsel, E., Leuning, R., Cleugh, H. A., Keith, H., Suni, T., 2007. Nocturnal carbon efflux: reconciliation of <b>eddy</b> covariance and <b>chamber</b> measurements using an alternative to the u*-threshold filtering technique. Tellus 59 B, 397 - 403, Tellus, 59 B, 307 - 403). The approach is based on the assumption that advection is small relative to the vertical turbulent flux (F-C) and change in storage (F-S) of CO 2 in the few hours after sundown. The sum of F-C and F-S reach a maximum during this period which is used to derive a temperature response function for ecosystem respiration. Measured hourly soil temperatures are then used with this function to estimate respiration R-Rmax. The new approach yielded excellent agreement with (1) independent measurements using respiration chambers, (2) with estimates using ecosystem light-response curves of F-c + F-s extrapolated to zero light, R-LRC, and (3) with a detailed process-based forest ecosystem model, R-cast. At most sites respiration rates estimated using the u*-filter, R-ust, were smaller than R-Rmax, and R-LRC. Agreement of our approach with independent measurements indicates that R-Rmax, provides an excellent estimate of nighttime ecosystem respiration. (C) 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|Net {{ecosystem}} {{exchange of}} carbon (FNEE) was estimated for a temperate broadleaf, evergreen eucalypt forest ecosystem at Tumbarumba in south-eastern Australia {{to investigate the}} processes controlling forest carbon sinks and their response to climate. Measurements at a range of temporal and spatial scales were used to make three different estimates of FNEE based on: (1) the difference between fluxes of carbon input by photosynthesis and output by autotrophic plus heterotrophic respiration, (2) changes over time in the carbon pools in the above- and below-ground biomass, soil and litter, and (3) micrometeorological flux measurements that provide a continuous estimate of the net exchange. A rigorous comparison of aggregated component fluxes and the net eddy fluxes within a flux tower source area was achieved based on an inventory of the site and a detailed sampling strategy. Measurements replicated {{in space and time}} provided mean values, confidence limits and patterns of variation of carbon pools and fluxes that allowed comparisons within known limits of uncertainty. As a result of comparisons between nighttime <b>eddy</b> flux and <b>chamber</b> measurements of respiration, a revised micrometeorological method was developed for estimating nighttime carbon flux using flux tower measurements. Uncertainty in the final estimate of FNEE was reduced through mutual constraints of each of these measurement approaches. FNEE for the period October 2001 -September 2002, with average rainfall, was an uptake of 6. 7 (5. 1 - 8. 3) tC ha- 1 yr- 1 estimated from component fluxes, and 5. 4 (3. 0 - 7. 5) tC ha- 1 yr- 1 estimated from the revised eddy flux method. Biomass increment was 4. 5 (3. 7 - 5. 4) tC ha- 1 yr- 1 and the remaining 0. 9 - 2. 2 tC ha- 1 yr- 1 could represent a carbon sink in the soil and litter pools or lie within the confidence limits of the measured fluxes. FNEE was reduced to - 0. 1 to 2. 4 tC ha- 1 yr- 1 during a period of drought and insect disturbance in October 2002 -September 2003, with biomass increment being the main component reduced. The forest is a large carbon sink compared with other forest ecosystems, but this is subject to high-annual variability in response to climate variability and disturbance. 24 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Large {{variability}} in N 2 O emissions from managed grasslands may occur because most emissions originate in surface litter or near-surface soil where {{variability in}} soil water content (θ) and temperature (T s) is greatest. To determine whether temporal variability in θ and T s of surface litter and near-surface soil could explain this in N 2 O emissions, a simulation experiment {{was conducted with}} ecosys, a comprehensive mathematical model of terrestrial ecosystems in which processes governing N 2 O emissions were represented at high temporal and spatial resolution. Model performance was verified by comparing N 2 O emissions, CO 2 and energy exchange, and θ and T s modelled by ecosys with those measured by automated <b>chambers,</b> <b>eddy</b> covariance (EC) and soil sensors on an hourly timescale during several emission events from 2004 to 2009 in an intensively managed pasture at Oensingen, Switzerland. Both modelled and measured events were induced by precipitation following harvesting and subsequent fertilizing or manuring. These events were brief (2 – 5  days) with maximum N 2 O effluxes that varied from [*][*]  3  mg N m − 2 h − 1 in summer. Only very small emissions were modelled or measured outside these events. In the model, emissions were generated almost entirely in surface litter or near-surface (0 – 2  cm) soil, at rates driven by N availability with fertilization vs. N uptake with grassland regrowth and by O 2 supply controlled by litter and soil wetting relative to O 2 demand from microbial respiration. In the model, NO x availability relative to O 2 limitation governed both the reduction of more oxidized electron acceptors to N 2 O and the reduction of N 2 O to N 2, so that the magnitude of N 2 O emissions was not simply related to surface and near-surface θ and T s. Modelled N 2 O emissions {{were found to be}} sensitive to defoliation intensity and timing which controlled plant N uptake and soil θ and T s prior to and during emission events. Reducing leaf area index (LAI) remaining after defoliation to half that under current practice and delaying harvesting by 5  days raised modelled N 2 O emissions by as much as 80  % during subsequent events and by an average of 43  % annually. Modelled N 2 O emissions were also found to be sensitive to surface soil properties. Increasing near-surface bulk density by 10  % raised N 2 O emissions by as much as 100  % during emission events and by an average of 23  % annually. Relatively small spatial variation in management practices and soil surface properties could therefore cause the large spatial variation in N 2 O emissions commonly found in field studies. The global warming potential from annual N 2 O emissions in this intensively managed grassland largely offset those from net C uptake in both modelled and field experiments. However, model results indicated that this offset could be adversely affected by suboptimal land management and soil properties...|$|R
