5|$|After the French Revolution, she {{was renamed}} Vengeur du Peuple and {{took part in}} the Glorious First of June. There, she was {{disabled}} after a furious duel with HMS Brunswick and surrendered after losing hope of being rescued by a French ship. After a few hours, as British ships were beginning rescue operations, she listed and foundered, taking almost <b>half</b> <b>her</b> crew with her.|$|E

60|$|I {{found her}} fumbling {{at the wall}} of the after bulkhead, and, <b>half</b> leading <b>her,</b> <b>half</b> {{carrying}} <b>her,</b> I took her up the companion-way.

5|$|To {{prevent this}} ship {{challenging}} British {{dominance in the}} theatre, the Royal Navy ordered a ship of the line from the Mediterranean fleet to intercept and capture Rivoli on her maiden voyage. Captain John Talbot of HMS Victorious arrived off Venice in mid-February and blockaded the port. When Rivoli attempted to escape under cover of fog, Talbot chased her and forced her to surrender in a five-hour battle, Rivoli losing over <b>half</b> <b>her</b> crew wounded or dead.|$|E
5|$|At Elizabeth's first {{interrogation}} session, the Japanese {{told her}} that some ships had been sunk in the harbour {{and they wanted to}} know the location of a large amount of money. She claimed no knowledge of the matter but was repeatedly interrogated and beaten. At various times, the Kempeitai forced Elizabeth to kneel on some angled bars of wood on the floor. They stripped her topless and tied her to the wood so she could not go either forwards or backwards. Then they applied electric shocks to her. They even brought in her husband to let him see her being tortured. After nine months in captivity, Elizabeth had lost <b>half</b> <b>her</b> body weight.|$|E
5|$|For a {{while it}} seemed that Franklin would also be burnt, but her crew were able {{to put out the}} fires. With Brueys killed aboard Orient, Du Chayla now became commander. Both he and Captain Gillet had been seriously wounded and taken below, but he {{continued}} to order the attack. The brief quiet that had resulted from the explosion of the Orient was broken by Franklins guns, and the battle resumed. She fought for another hour, but by then she had lost her main and mizzenmasts, nearly all of her cannons had been knocked out, and over <b>half</b> <b>her</b> crew were dead or wounded. She finally struck her colours.|$|E
6000|$|A smile, which Shirley {{would not}} permit to expand, made her lip tremble; she bent her face, and hid it <b>half</b> with <b>her</b> arms, <b>half</b> in <b>her</b> curls, which, as she stooped, fell loose again. [...] "Certainly I was a rebel," [...] she answered.|$|R

5|$|By July 1945 the Imperial Japanese Navy's (IJN's) {{remaining}} large warships {{were unable}} to put to sea due to shortages of fuel and the dangers of attack from Allied aircraft and submarines. While most of these warships were anchored near the major naval base at Kure and other locations in the Seto Inland Sea, Nagato and several smaller warships were stationed at Yokosuka Naval Arsenal in Tokyo Bay. At this time the battleship was moored alongside a pier facing northwest and covered in camouflage that was intended to make her difficult for aircraft to spot. All of Nagatos secondary armament and about <b>half</b> <b>her</b> anti-aircraft guns had been removed and emplaced on nearby hills from where they could provide protection to the naval base. Although the battleship's boilers were not lit, she received steam and power from the submarine chaser Fukugawa Maru No.7 and an auxiliary boiler located on the pier. The destroyer Ushio was also docked nearby {{in a position where}} she was able to protect the battleship with her 25mm anti-aircraft guns.|$|E
5|$|Her {{career began}} as the {{flagship}} of Rear-Admiral Armand Blanquet du Chayla, {{second in command}} at the Battle of the Nile, where she distinguished herself with her fierce resistance before being forced to surrender with over <b>half</b> <b>her</b> crew dead or wounded, and most of her guns disabled. Taken into British service she was refitted and served as the flagship of several admirals. Commanded by Francis Austen Canopus was Rear-Admiral Thomas Louis's flagship in the Mediterranean under Nelson, and narrowly missed the fighting at Trafalgar. She saw action with Duckworth's fleet at the Battle of San Domingo, and remained with him during the attempt to force the Dardanelles, and the operations {{in support of the}} Alexandria expedition in 1807. She remained active against the French in the Mediterranean {{for the rest of the}} Napoleonic Wars, helping to drive ashore two large French ships of the line in a notable incident in 1809. Canopus remained in service after the end of the wars, serving as a flagship into the mid-nineteenth century, but as sail gave way to steam, she was relegated to support duties in Devonport, becoming a receiving ship, tender and a mooring hulk. She was eventually sold for breaking up in 1887, after nearly ninety years in British service.|$|E
5|$|The three cruisers were {{gradually}} drawing {{away from}} their pursuers when Novara, leading the Austrian ships, was hit several times; most critically in the engine room that knocked out <b>half</b> <b>her</b> boilers. Helgoland was also hit five times, but not seriously, aside from one gun disabled. One crewman had been killed and 16 were wounded. The British ships turned away, around the time that Novara had to extinguish her remaining boilers and went dead in the water, upon learning that more Austrian ships were approaching. Saida was preparing to take Novara under tow when several Italian destroyers attacked in succession. The weight of fire from the three cruisers prevented them from closing to torpedo range and they scored no hits. The Allied ship returned to Brindisi and the Austrians slowly proceeded back to base. Helgoland had fired 1052 shells from her 10cm guns. Heyssler received the Order of Leopold with crossed swords in recognition of his leadership during the battle.|$|E
