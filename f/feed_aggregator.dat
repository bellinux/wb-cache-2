40|$|Abstract: Content {{syndication}} through RSS {{is gaining}} wide acceptance, {{and it is}} envisaged that <b>feed</b> <b>aggregators</b> will be provided as a commodity in future browsers. As we consume more of our information by way of RSS feeds, search mechanisms other than simple keyword search will be required. To this end, advances in semantic tooling can effectively improve {{the current state of}} the art in <b>feed</b> <b>aggregators.</b> This work reports on the benets of making a popular RSS aggregator, RSSOwl, ontology-aware. The paper uses three common functions, namely, semantic view, semantic navigation and semantic query, to illustrate how RSS aggregators can be ontology powered. The outcome is that location, browsing and rendering of RSS feeds are customised to the conceptual model of the reader, making RSS aggregators a powerful companion to face the RSSosphere. The system has been fully implemented, and successfully tested by distinct users. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceDuring {{the past}} several years RSS-based content {{syndication}} has become a standard technique for efficiently and timely disseminating information on the web. From a data processing perspective RSS feeds are standard XML resources which are periodically refreshed by <b>feed</b> <b>aggregators</b> for generating continuous streams of items. In this article, we study the problem of information loss {{in the context of a}} content-based feed aggregation system and we propose a new best-effort refresh strategy for RSS feeds under limited bandwidth. This strategy is evaluated experimentally and compared to other state-of-the-art crawling strategies for web pages...|$|R
40|$|RSS is the XML-based {{format for}} {{syndication}} of Web contents, and users aggregate RSS feeds with RSS <b>feed</b> <b>aggregators.</b> There are RSS aggregation policies that help aggregate RSS feeds effectively. In this paper, we first propose an aggregation policy {{to minimize the}} number of missing postings within an aggregation. Second, we analyze and compare our aggregation policy with existing aggregation policies. Our analysis reveals that our aggregation policy can reduce approximately 23 % of the missing posts in comparison with an existing policy while it increases only 6 % of the aggregation delay...|$|R

50|$|In computing, a news aggregator, also {{termed a}} <b>feed</b> <b>aggregator,</b> feed reader, news reader, RSS reader or simply aggregator, is client {{software}} or a web application which aggregates syndicated web content such as online newspapers, blogs, podcasts, and video blogs (vlogs) in one location for easy viewing. RSS is a synchronized subscription system. Basically, RSS uses {{extensible markup language}} (XML) to structure pieces of information to be aggregated in a feed reader that displays the information in a user-friendly interface. The updates distributed include, for example, journal tables of contents, podcasts, videos, and news items.|$|E
5000|$|Most web browsers {{can display}} {{a list of}} web pages that the user has bookmarked so that the user can quickly return to them.

Personal weblogs, commercial web sites, news portals and social media applications generate highly dynamic information streams which {{have to be}} propagated to millions of users. This article focuses {{on the problem of}} estimating the publication frequency of highly dynamic web resources. We illustrate the importance of developing efficient online estimation techniques for improving the refresh strategies of RSS <b>feed</b> <b>aggregators</b> like Google Reader [8], Datasift [7] or Roses [11]. We study the temporal publication characteristics of a large collection of real world RSS feeds and we define and evaluate several online estimation methods in cohesion with different refresh strategies.

40|$|Users of <b>feed</b> <b>aggregators</b> {{know that}} {{duplicated}} articles are found occasionally on the feeds they subscribe to. It can be time consuming {{to read all}} articles and stumble upon duplicated items they have already read. Our work here {{is to determine the}} effectiveness of using basic word matching to remove duplicated items and only show the most relevant item, thus saving readers? time. The method described in this paper to remove duplicates involves word matching heuristics with an appropriate matching percentage. The duplicated feeds are then ranked to only display the highest ranked article. Ranking is done using the number of search items found on the titles of the news feeds where the highest number returned will be considered the highest ranked article. Using Malaysian online news feeds, our method found that with a matching percentage of 40 %, the method will be able to minimize duplicate...|$|R
50|$|FriendFeed was a {{real-time}} <b>feed</b> <b>aggregator</b> that consolidated updates {{from social}} media and social networking websites, social bookmarking websites, blogs and microblogging updates, {{as well as}} any type of RSS/Atom feed. Created by Bret Taylor, Jim Norris, Paul Buchheit and Sanjeev Singh. It was possible to use this stream of information to create customized feeds to share, as well as originate new posts-discussions, (and comment) with friends. Friendfeed was built on top of Tornado. The service was shut down at about 21:00 GMT on April 10, 2015, though the service blog announced it a month before.|$|E

40|$|Feed {{syndication}} {{is analogous}} to electronic newsletters, both are aimed at delivering feeds to subscribers; {{the difference is that}} while newsletter subscription requires e-mail and exposed you to spam and security challenges, feed syndication ensures that you only get what you requested for. This paper reports a review {{on the state of the}} art of feed aggregation technology and the development of a locally hosted web based <b>feed</b> <b>aggregator</b> as a research tool using the core features of WordPress; the software was further enhanced with plugins and widgets for dynamic content publishing, database and object caching, social web syndication, back-up and maintenance, among others. The results highlight the current developments in software re-use and describes; how open source content management systems can be used for both online and offline publishing, a means whereby <b>feed</b> <b>aggregator</b> users can control and share feed data, as well as how web developers can focus on extending the features of built-in software libraries in applications rather than reinventing the wheel.

5000|$|RSS uses {{extensible}} {{markup language}} (XML) to structure pieces of information to be aggregated in a feed reader that displays the information in a user-friendly interface. [...] Before subscribe RSS, users have to install either [...] "feed reader" [...] or [...] "aggregator" [...] applications in order to read RSS <b>feed.</b> The <b>aggregator</b> provides a consolidated view of the content in one browser display or desktop application. [...] "Desktop applications offer the advantages of a potentially richer user interface and {{of being able to}} provide some content even when the computer is not connected to the Internet. Webbased feed readers offer the great convenience of allowing users to access up-to-date feeds from any Internet-connected computer." [...] Although some applications will have an automated process to subscribe to a news feed, the basic way to subscribe is by simply clicking on the RSS icon and/or text link. Aggregation features are frequently built into web portal sites, in the web browsers themselves, in email applications or in application software designed specifically for reading <b>feeds.</b> <b>Aggregators</b> with podcasting capabilities can automatically download media files, such as MP3 recordings. In some cases, these can be automatically loaded onto portable media players (like iPods) when they are connected to the end-user's computer. By 2011, so-called RSS-narrators appeared, which aggregated text-only news feeds, and converted them into audio recordings for offline listening. The syndicated content an aggregator will retrieve and interpret is usually supplied in the form of RSS or other XML-formatted data, such as RDF/XML or Atom.|$|R
