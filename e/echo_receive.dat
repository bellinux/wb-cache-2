40|$|An {{innovative}} electromagnetic {{model for}} the radar <b>echoes</b> <b>received</b> by a microwave altimeter is proposed: {{it is based on}} fractal models employed both to describe the natural surface and to evaluate the surface scattering behaviour. The scattering surface is modelled by means of the fractional Brownian model (fBm) process, whose realizations are obtained by using the band-limited Weierstrass-Mandelbrot (WM) function. The scattering process is evaluated by means of the Physical Optics solution specifically derived for fractal surfaces. Rationale to apply this solution to the evaluation (in time domain) of the <b>received</b> <b>echoes</b> is provided. Dependence of the return pulse shapes on surface topography at different roughness scales is highlighted: some relevant meaningful examples are presented.

40|$|The {{stability}} of the <b>receiving</b> <b>echo</b> in laser tracking was useful for keeping track of targets in their orbits. The reflected signal was affected by the reflection distributing characteristic of the target surface and laser incidence angle. In this paper the bidirectional reflection distributing function (BRDF) was used to analyse {{the effects of the}} <b>receiving</b> <b>echo.</b> The bidirectional reflection distribution of target satellite surface was obtained, it contained that the component of diffuse reflection became larger and the component of specular reflection became small as the increase of the target surface roughness. The <b>receiving</b> <b>echo</b> increased as the increase of the component of specular reflection, when the incidence angle was small. The <b>receiving</b> <b>echo</b> power decreased quickly under the bigger incidence angle. When the incidence angle was larger than 34, the minimum <b>receiving</b> <b>echo</b> power that was computed by the BRDF was lower than the one computed by the lidar formula. At this time, the illuminating laser power should become five-times of the former one or the receiving aperture became 2. 5 times of the former one, these methods could remove the effect of decreasing of the <b>receiving</b> <b>echo</b> power. The white coating of thermal control diffuse reflection material and F 36 of the multi-cladding specular reflection material were used to do the experiment. The experiments results accorded with the simulation results. The white coating has a big surface roughness, the scanning angle was bigger, and the specular reflection component was small. When the incident angle was smaller than 45 degrees, the <b>receiving</b> <b>echo</b> power that was computed by the BRDF was bigger than one computed by the lidar formula. The multi-cladding has a small surface roughness, the specular reflection component was big. There were no reflected signals when the incidence angle was bigger than 2 degrees...|$|R
