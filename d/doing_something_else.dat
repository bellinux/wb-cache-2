500|$|Perreault {{developed}} {{a reputation as a}} superb stickhandler, and scored a goal on his first shift in a professional scrimmage. [...] Bobby Orr once said of Perreault: [...] "His head and shoulders go one way, his legs go the other way, and the puck is <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> [...] When I first saw it I couldn't believe it." [...] His popularity and respect surpassed O. J. Simpson in a poll of Buffalonians about the best Buffalo athlete. [...] Phil Esposito once said if anyone was to break his 76-goal, 152 point season records [...] "It will be Gilbert Perreault." ...|$|E
500|$|Author James Mann {{disagreed}} with both critics like Hoare, who saw Reagan's speech as having no real effect, {{and those who}} praised the speech as key to shaking Soviet confidence. In a 2007 opinion article in The New York Times, he put the speech {{in the context of}} previous Reagan overtures to the Soviet Union, such as the Reykjavik summit of the previous year, which had very nearly resulted in an agreement to eliminate American and Soviet nuclear weapons entirely. He characterized the speech as a way for Reagan to assuage his right-wing critics that he was still tough on communism, while also extending a renewed invitation to Gorbachev to work together to create [...] "the vastly more relaxed climate in which the Soviets sat on their hands when the wall came down." [...] Reagan, claimed Mann, [...] "wasn't trying to land a knockout blow on the Soviet regime, nor was he engaging in mere political theater. He was instead <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> on that damp day in Berlin 20 years [...] – he was helping to set the terms {{for the end of the}} cold war." ...|$|E

500|$|After reading God of War #1, Joe Juba of Game Informer said [...] "If {{you have}} a choice between reading this comic and <b>doing</b> <b>{{something}}</b> <b>else,</b> you should do something else...like play God of War III again." [...] He said that the story adds nothing of value and it is rough. Despite being written by Marv Wolfman, he said the story does not satisfy fans of the video game series: [...] "I didn't think the story made much sense, and it doesn't contribute to the overall lore of the universe; it just seems to be setting Kratos up for another fetch-quest." [...] He also felt that the writing was exceptionally low in quality. Comic Vine said, [...] "The idea here screams comic books," [...] however, the [...] "results were a mixed offering." [...] The reviewer stated that the idea of Kratos finding the Ambrosia to save Calliope was a [...] "perfect comic book incentive," [...] however, things started to disintegrate when the distinction between the present and the past became unclear. A four out of five star review from Binary Messiah praised the comic series, saying that it could be made into a full game: [...] "That's one freaking awesome story. That right there is a premise to a whole new God of War game." [...] They said that it [...] "does a good job showing the hot headedness of Kratos and his selfishness." [...] Saying that the comics do the video game series justice, for fans of God of War, this should be in their comic collection.|$|E
2500|$|Bryan Cranston as Walter White– a {{chemistry}} teacher diagnosed with Stage IIIA lung cancer who turns to making meth to secure his family's finances. As his shady business progresses, Walter gains a notorious reputation {{under the name}} of 'Heisenberg.' Cranston stated that, though he enjoyed doing comedy, he decided he ... should really focus on <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> But I think any good drama worth its weight always has a sprinkling of comedy in it, because you can ease the tension to an audience when it's necessary, and then build it back up again. Walt White has no clue he's occasionally funny, but as an actor, I recognize when there are comedic moments and opportunities.|$|E

60|$|In {{my opinion}} a man's first {{duty is to}} find a way of {{supporting}} himself, thereby relieving other people of the necessity of supporting him. Moreover, the learning to do work of practical value in the world, in an exact and careful manner, is of itself a very-important education, the effects of which make themselves felt in all other pursuits. The habit of doing that which you do not care about when you would much rather be <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>else,</b> is invaluable.|$|E

'And why is this silent Frenchman smoking your Latakia,' he {{continued}} in a low voice. 'He comes to Jerusalem {{at the same time}} as this Englishman. There is more in this than meets our eye. You do not know the northern nations. They exist only in political combinations. You are not a politician, my Besso.

"Suppose {{a company}} of {{soldiers}} should be ordered to form a line, and instead of simply obeying that order, they should all set at work, each in his own way, <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> One man, {{at one end of}} the line, begins to load and fire his gun; another takes out his knapsack, and begins to eat his luncheon; a third amuses himself by going as fast as possible through the exercise; and another still, begins to march about, hither and thither, facing to the right and left, and performing all the evolutions he can think of.

And under the circumstances, you might like to give up--might find a better field. These people might not take that high view of you which I have always taken, as an alter ego, a right hand--though I always looked forward to your <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> I think of having a run into France.

60|$|But now, on reflection, {{a dreadful}} sinking assails me, {{that this was}} not really work. The artistic callings--you {{remember}} how Stevenson thumped them--are merely doing what you are clamorous to be at; it is not real work unless you would rather be <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> My so-called labours were just M'Connachie running away with me again. Still, I have sometimes worked; for instance, I feel that I am working at this moment. And the big guns are in the same plight as the little ones. Carlyle, the king of all rectors, has always been accepted as the arch-apostle of toil, and has registered his many woes. But it will not do. Despite sickness, poortith, want and all, he was grinding all his life at the one job he revelled in. An extraordinarily happy man, though there is no direct proof that he thought so.|$|E
60|$|So now we {{have our}} three little figures drawn as clearly as a clumsy pen can follow such subtle elusive creatures of mood and fancy. We will suppose {{now that it is}} a summer evening, that Daddy is seated smoking in his chair, that the Lady is {{listening}} somewhere near, and that the three are in a tumbled heap upon the bear-skin before the empty fireplace trying to puzzle out the little problems of their tiny lives. When three children play with a new thought it is like three kittens with a ball, one giving it a pat and another a pat, as they chase it from point to point. Daddy would interfere as little as possible, save when he was called upon to explain or to deny. It was usually wiser for him to pretend to be <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>else.</b> Then their talk was the more natural. On this occasion, however, he was directly appealed to.|$|E
60|$|When he saw us, {{he jumped}} up {{and went over to}} father and shook his hand quite warmly. Father took him very coolly. Rupert, however, did not seem to see it, but came towards me heartily. I {{happened}} to be <b>doing</b> <b>something</b> <b>else</b> at the moment, and at first I did not see his hand; but just as I was looking at it the clock struck eleven. Whilst it was striking Mr. Trent came into the room. Close behind him came his clerk, carrying a locked tin box. There were two other men also. He bowed to us all in turn, beginning with me. I was standing opposite the door; the others were scattered about. Father sat still, but Sir Colin and Mr. St. Leger rose. Mr. Trent not did shake hands with any of us--not even me. Nothing but his respectful bow. That is the etiquette for an attorney, I understand, on such formal occasions.|$|E
