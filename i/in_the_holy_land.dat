5|$|In 1242, the {{citizens}} of Tyre offered the barons opposed to Frederick's rule (Balian of Ibelin, Lord of Beirut, and Philip of Montfort, Lord of Toron) their assistance against Richard Filangieri, who ruled Tyre on Frederick's behalf. Marsilio Zorzi, the bailli of the Venetian community <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> offered naval support to the coalition. At {{the request of the}} members of the High Court, Philip of Novara, a noted jurist, stated that Frederick had forfeited his right to administer the Kingdom of Jerusalem when his son, Conrad, had reached the age of majority on 25 April 1243. Novara also argued that Alice and her husband were entitled to rule the kingdom as regent for the absent Conrad because she was his closest relative who lived <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land.</b> The members of the High Court, the representatives of the clergy, the Military Orders and the Italian communities held a joint assembly where Alice and Ralph of Nesle were proclaimed regents on 5 June. She agreed that Balian of Ibelin and Philip of Montfort would keep all royal castles in the kingdom.|$|E

5|$|As a human institution, Byzantium {{under the}} Komnenoi {{played a key}} role in the history of the Crusades <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> while also exerting {{enormous}} cultural and political influence in Europe, the Near East, and the lands around the Mediterranean Sea. The Komnenian emperors, particularly John and Manuel, exerted great influence over the Crusader states of Outremer, whilst Alexios I {{played a key role}} in the course of the First Crusade, which he helped bring about.|$|E
5|$|John did {{not return}} to the crusaders in Egypt for several months. According to a letter from the prelates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> to Philip II of France, lack of funds kept John from leaving his kingdom. Since his nephew Walter IV was {{approaching}} the age of majority, John surrendered the County of Brienne in 1221. During John's absence from Egypt, Al-Kamil again offered to restore the Holy Land to the Kingdom of Jerusalem in June 1221; Pelagius refused him. John returned to Egypt and rejoined the crusade on 6 July 1221 at the command of Pope Honorius.|$|E
5|$|The Crusades <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> are {{traditionally}} counted as nine distinct campaigns, numbered from the First Crusade of 1095–99 to the Ninth Crusade of 1271–72. This convention {{is used by}} Charles Mills in his History of the Crusades for the Recovery and Possession of the Holy Land (1820), and is often retained for convenience {{even though it is}} somewhat arbitrary. The Fifth and Sixth Crusades led by FrederickII may be considered a single campaign, as can the Eighth Crusade and Ninth Crusade led by LouisIX.|$|E

She introduced those conventions in her own lands {{on the island of}} Oleron <b>in</b> 1160 (with <b>the</b> [...] "Rolls of Oléron") and later in England as well.

5|$|While castles {{were used}} to hold a site and control {{movement}} of armies, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> some key strategic positions were left unfortified. Castle architecture in the East became more complex around the late 12th and early 13thcenturies after the stalemate of the Third Crusade (1189–1192). Both Christians and Muslims created fortifications, and the character of each was different. Saphadin, the 13th-century ruler of the Saracens, created structures with large rectangular towers that influenced Muslim architecture and were copied again and again, however they had little influence on Crusader castles.|$|E
5|$|After the Franks {{were driven}} from the Holy Land in 1291, European {{familiarity}} with the castles of the Crusades declined. It {{was not until the}} 19thcentury that interest in these buildings was renewed, so there are no detailed plans from before 1837. Guillaume Rey was the first European researcher to scientifically study Crusader castles <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land.</b> In 1871 he published the work Etudes sur les monuments de l'architecture militaire des Croisés en Syrie et dans l'ile de Chypre; it included plans and drawings of the major Crusader castles in Syria, including Krak des Chevaliers. In some instances his drawings were inaccurate, however for Krak des Chavaliers they record features which have since been lost.|$|E
5|$|As a bishop, Baldwin {{came to the}} {{attention}} of King Henry II of England, who was so impressed he insisted that Baldwin become archbishop. In that office, Baldwin quarrelled with his cathedral clergy over the founding of a church, which led to the imprisonment of the clergy in their cloister for more than a year. Baldwin spent some time in Wales with Gerald of Wales, preaching and raising money for the Third Crusade. After the coronation of King Richard I, the new king sent Baldwin ahead to the Holy Land, where he became embroiled in the politics of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Baldwin died <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land</b> while participating in the crusade; his long-running dispute with his clergy led one chronicler to characterise Baldwin as more damaging to Christianity than Saladin.|$|E

5|$|Each of the Christian forces {{felt betrayed}} by the other. A new plan was made to attack Ascalon and Conrad took his troops there, but no further help arrived, {{due to the lack}} of trust that had {{resulted}} from the failed siege. This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land.</b> After quitting Ascalon, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. Louis remained behind in Jerusalem until 1149. The discord also extended to the marriage of Louis and Eleanor, which had been falling apart during the course of the Crusade. In April 1149, Louis and Eleanor, who were barely on speaking terms by this time, pointedly boarded separate ships to take them back to France.|$|E

This mutual distrust would linger for a generation due to the defeat, to the ruin of the Christian kingdoms <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land.</b> Following the battle, Conrad returned to Constantinople to further his alliance with Manuel. As a result of the attack, Damascus no longer trusted the crusaders, and the city was formally handed over to Nur ad-Din in 1154. Bernard of Clairvaux was also humiliated, and when his attempt to call a new crusade failed, he tried to disassociate himself from the fiasco of the Second Crusade altogether.|$|E
5|$|In the East the {{situation}} was much darker for the Christians. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> the Second Crusade had disastrous long-term consequences for Jerusalem.

The ra'is of Damascus and commander of the ahdath milita Mu'ayad al-Dawhal Ibn al-Sufi feel that since his ahdath had {{played a major role in}} defeating the Second Crusade that he deserved a greater share of the power, and within two months of Anur's death was leading a rebellion against Abaq. The in-fighting within Damascus was to lead to the end of the Burid state within five years. Damascus no longer trusted the crusader kingdom and was taken by Nur ad-Din after a short siege in 1154.|$|E

5|$|Manuel {{was very}} {{successful}} in expanding his influence, particularly over the Crusader states. As an example, he participated in the building and decorating {{of many of the}} basilicas and Greek monasteries <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem where due to his efforts the Byzantine clergy were allowed to perform the Greek liturgy each day. All this reinforced his position as overlord of the Crusader states, with his hegemony over Antioch and Jerusalem secured by agreement with Raynald, Prince of Antioch, and Amalric, King of Jerusalem. This success in gaining influence and allies among the western states and the Pope is regarded one of the most impressive achievements of Manuel Komnenos's reign.|$|E

Maulay had endowed a chantry at Meaux Abbey in Yorkshire in memory of his wife. He also confirmed grants of lands to Eskdale Priory, a Grandmontine house founded by Isabella's father, and to Nostell Priory. Maulay was also a benefactor of the Knights of Saint Thomas, a military religious order for Englishmen.|$|E

5|$|Aldfrith {{appears to}} have had the support of leading ecclesiastics, most notably his {{half-sister}} Ælfflæd and the highly respected Bishop Cuthbert. He is known to have received confirmation at the hands of Aldhelm, later the Bishop of Sherborne in the south-western Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Wessex. Aldhelm too had received an Irish education, but in Britain, at Malmesbury. Correspondence between the two survives, and Aldhelm sent Aldfrith his treatise on the numerology of the number seven, the Epistola ad Acircium. Aldfrith also owned a manuscript on cosmography, which (according to Bede) he purchased from Abbot Ceolfrith of Monkwearmouth-Jarrow in exchange for an estate valued at eight hides. Aldfrith was a close friend of Adomnán, Abbot of Iona from 679, and may have studied with him. In the 680s Aldfrith twice met with Adomnán, who came to seek the release of the Irish captives taken in Berht's expedition of 684. These were released and Adomnán presented Aldfrith with a copy of his treatise De Locis Sanctis ("On the Holy Places"), a description of the places of pilgrimage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> and at Alexandria and Constantinople. Bede reports that Aldfrith circulated Adomnán's work for others to read.|$|E
5|$|Although {{sometimes}} {{the construction of}} a castle led to the destruction of a village, such as at Eaton Socon in England, it was more common for the villages nearby to have grown {{as a result of the}} presence of a castle. Sometimes planned towns or villages were created around a castle. The benefits of castle building on settlements was not confined to Europe. When the 13th-century Safad Castle was founded in Galilee <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land,</b> the 260villages benefitted from the inhabitants' newfound ability to move freely. When built, a castle could result in the restructuring of the local landscape, with roads moved for the convenience of the lord. Settlements could also grow naturally around a castle, rather than being planned, due to the benefits of proximity to an economic centre in a rural landscape and the safety given by the defences. Not all such settlements survived, as once the castle lost its importance– perhaps succeeded by a manor house as the centre of administration– the benefits of living next to a castle vanished and the settlement depopulated.|$|E
5|$|Several {{attempts}} at a Franco-Mongol alliance against the Islamic caliphates, their common enemy, {{were made by}} various leaders among the Frankish Crusaders and the Mongol Empire in the 13th century. Such an alliance might have seemed an obvious choice: the Mongols were already sympathetic to Christianity, given the presence of many influential Nestorian Christians in the Mongol court. The Franks (Western Europeans {{and those in the}} Crusader States of the Levant) were open to the idea of support from the East, in part owing to the long-running legend of the mythical Prester John, an Eastern king in a magical kingdom who many believed would one day come to the assistance of the Crusaders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Holy</b> <b>Land.</b> The Franks and Mongols also shared a common enemy in the Muslims. However, despite many messages, gifts, and emissaries {{over the course of several}} decades, the often-proposed alliance never came to fruition.|$|E
