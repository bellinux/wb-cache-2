5|$|Among the {{approaches}} {{aimed at improving}} cell survival {{in the presence of}} mutant <b>huntingtin</b> are correction of transcriptional regulation using histone deacetylase inhibitors, modulating aggregation of <b>huntingtin,</b> improving metabolism and mitochondrial function and restoring function of synapses.|$|E
5|$|All {{humans have}} {{two copies of}} the <b>Huntingtin</b> gene (HTT), which codes for the protein <b>Huntingtin</b> (HTT). The gene is also called HD and IT15, which stands for 'interesting {{transcript}} 15'. Part of this gene is a repeated section called a trinucleotide repeat, which varies in length between individuals and may change length between generations. If the repeat is present in a healthy gene, a dynamic mutation may increase the repeat count and result in a defective gene. When the length of this repeated section reaches a certain threshold, it produces an altered form of the protein, called mutant <b>Huntingtin</b> protein (mHTT). The differing functions of these proteins are the cause of pathological changes which in turn cause the disease symptoms. The Huntington's disease mutation is genetically dominant and almost fully penetrant: mutation of either of a person's HTT alleles causes the disease. It is not inherited according to sex, but {{the length of the}} repeated section of the gene and hence its severity can be influenced by the sex of the affected parent.|$|E
5|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} a {{neurodegenerative}} genetic disorder {{that is associated with}} protein misfolding and aggregation. Excessive repeats of the glutamine amino acid at the N-terminus of the <b>Huntingtin</b> protein cause aggregation, and although the behavior of the repeats is not completely understood, it does lead to the cognitive decline associated with the disease. As with other aggregates, there is difficulty in experimentally determining its structure. Scientists are using Folding@home to study the structure of the <b>Huntingtin</b> protein aggregate and to predict how it forms, assisting with rational drug design methods to stop the aggregate formation. The N17 fragment of the <b>Huntingtin</b> protein accelerates this aggregation, and while there have been several mechanisms proposed, its exact role in this process remains largely unknown. Folding@home has simulated this and other fragments to clarify their roles in the disease. Since 2008, its drug design methods for Alzheimer's disease have been applied to Huntington's.|$|E
5|$|Mutant <b>Huntingtin</b> is {{expressed}} {{throughout the body}} and associated with abnormalities in peripheral tissues that are directly caused by such expression outside the brain. These abnormalities include muscle atrophy, cardiac failure, impaired glucose tolerance, weight loss, osteoporosis, and testicular atrophy.|$|E
5|$|Generally, {{people have}} fewer than 36 {{repeated}} glutamines in the polyQ region {{which results in}} production of the cytoplasmic protein <b>Huntingtin.</b> However, a sequence of 36 or more glutamines results {{in the production of}} a protein which has different characteristics. This altered form, called mutant <b>huntingtin</b> (mHTT), increases the decay rate of certain types of neurons. Regions of the brain have differing amounts and reliance on these types of neurons, and are affected accordingly. Generally, the number of CAG repeats is related to how much this process is affected, and accounts for about 60% of the variation of the age of the onset of symptoms. The remaining variation is attributed to environment and other genes that modify the mechanism of HD. 36–39 repeats result in a reduced-penetrance form of the disease, with a much later onset and slower progression of symptoms. In some cases the onset may be so late that symptoms are never noticed. With very large repeat counts, HD has full penetrance and can occur under the age of 20, when it is then referred to as juvenile HD, akinetic-rigid, or Westphal variant HD. This accounts for about 7% of HD carriers.|$|E
5|$|The <b>huntingtin</b> protein {{interacts with}} over 100 other proteins, {{and appears to}} have {{multiple}} biological functions. The behavior of this mutated protein is not completely understood, but it is toxic to certain cell types, particularly in the brain. Early damage is most evident in the striatum, but as the disease progresses, {{other areas of the}} brain are also more conspicuously affected. Early symptoms are attributable to functions of the striatum and its cortical connections—namely control over movement, mood and higher cognitive function. DNA methylation also appears to be changed in HD.|$|E
5|$|Research {{is being}} {{conducted}} on many {{different approaches to}} prevent Huntington's disease or slow its progression. Disease-modifying strategies can be broadly grouped into three categories: reducing {{the level of the}} mutant <b>huntingtin</b> protein (including gene splicing and gene silencing); approaches aimed at improving neuronal survival by reducing the harm caused by the protein to specific cellular pathways and mechanisms (including protein homeostasis and histone deacetylase inhibition); and strategies to replace lost neurons. In addition, novel therapies to improve brain functioning are under development; these seek to produce symptomatic rather than disease-modifying therapies, and include phosphodiesterase inhibitors.|$|E
5|$|Gene {{silencing}} aims {{to reduce}} {{the production of the}} mutant protein, since HD is caused by a single dominant gene encoding a toxic protein. Gene silencing experiments in mouse models have shown that when the expression of mHTT is reduced, symptoms improve. Safety of non-allele specific RNAi and ASO gene silencing has now been demonstrated in mice and the large, human-like brains of primates. Allele-specific silencing attempts to silence mutant HTT while leaving wild-type HTT untouched. One way of accomplishing this is to identify polymorphisms present on only one allele and produce gene silencing drugs that target polymorphisms in only the mutant allele. The first 'gene silencing' trial involving human HD patients began in 2015, testing the safety of IONIS-HTTRx, produced by Ionis Pharmaceuticals and led by UCL Institute of Neurology. Mutant <b>huntingtin</b> was detected and quantified {{for the first time in}} cerebrospinal fluid from Huntington's disease mutation-carriers in 2015 using a novel 'single-molecule counting' immunoassay, providing a direct way to assess whether huntingtin-lowering treatments are achieving the desired effect. Similarly, gene splicing techniques are being looked at to try to repair a genome with the erroneous gene that causes HD, using tools such as CRISPR/Cas9.|$|E
25|$|Repeated {{sequences}} {{of fewer than}} ten nucleotides (e.g. the dinucleotide repeat (AC)n) are termed microsatellite sequences. Among the microsatellite sequences, trinucleotide repeats are of particular importance, as sometimes occur within coding regions of genes for proteins and may lead to genetic disorders. For example, Huntington's disease results from {{an expansion of the}} trinucleotide repeat (CAG)n within the <b>Huntingtin</b> gene on human chromosome 4. Telomeres (the ends of linear chromosomes) end with a microsatellite hexanucleotide repeat of the sequence (TTAGGG)n.|$|E
25|$|PIKKs {{have four}} domains at the protein level, which {{distinguish}} them from other protein kinases. From the N-terminus to the C-terminus, these domains are named FRAP-ATM-TRAAP (FAT), the kinase domain (KD), the PIKK-regulatory domain (PRD), and the FAT-C-terminal (FATC). The FAT domain, consisting of four α-helices, is N-terminal to KD, but that part {{is referred to}} as the FKBP12-rapamycin-binding (FRB) domain, which binds the FKBP12-rapamycin complex. The FAT domain consists of repeats, referred to as HEAT (<b>Huntingtin,</b> Elongation factor 3, A subunit of protein phosphatase 2A and TOR1). Specific protein activators regulate the PIKK kinases but binding of them to the kinase complex causes a conformational change that increases substrate access to the kinase domain.|$|E
25|$|The {{disease is}} {{characterized}} further by the gradual onset of defects in behavior and cognition, including dementia and speech impediments, {{beginning in the}} fourth or fifth decades of life. Death usually occurs within 10–20 years after a progressive worsening of symptoms. Caused by the <b>Huntingtin</b> gene, the disease eventually contributes to selective atrophy of the Caudate nucleus and Putamen, especially of GABAergic and acetylcholinergic neurons, with some additional degeneration of the frontal and temporal cortices of the brain. The disrupted signaling in the basal ganglia network is thought to cause the hyperkinesia. There is no known cure for Huntington’s Disease, yet there is treatment available to minimize the hyperkinetic movements. Dopamine blockers, such as haloperidol, tetrabenazine, and amantadine, are often effective in this regard.|$|E
25|$|Huntington's {{disease is}} one of the nine codon {{reiteration}} disorders caused by polyglutamine expansion mutations that include spino-cerebellar ataxia (SCA) 1, 2, 6, 7 and 3, spinobulbar muscular atrophy and dentatorubal-pallidoluysianatrophy. There may be a link between diseases caused by polyglutamine and polyalanine expansion mutations, as frame shifting of the original SCA3 gene product encoding CAG/polyglutamines to GCA/polyalanines. Ribosomal slippage during translation of the SCA3 protein has been proposed as the mechanism resulting in shifting from the polyglutamine to the polyalanine-encoding frame. A dinucleotide deletion or single nucleotide insertion within the polyglutamine tract of <b>huntingtin</b> exon 1 would shift the CAG, polyglutamineen coding frame by +1 (+1 frame shift) to the GCA, polyalanine-encoding frame and introduce a novel epitope to the C terminus of Htt exon 1 (APAAAPAATRPGCG).|$|E
25|$|Given {{that the}} subcommissural organ is not highly {{permeable}} {{and does not}} possess fenestrated capillaries like other subventricular organs, it {{has emerged as a}} major site of congenital hydrocephalus. It is suggested that this is related to immunological blockage of SCO secretions and Sylvian's aqueduct malformation and obliteration or turbulent cerebrospinal fluid flow due to the absence of Reissner's fibers. There is evidence that in transgenic mice the overexpression of Sox3 in the dorsal midline of the diencephalon in a dose-dependent manner and that the conditional inactivation of presenilin-1 or the lack of <b>huntingtin</b> in wnt cell lineages leads to congenital hydrocephalus, which highlights the role of these proteins mediating the relation between the SCO and the condition. A more recent study using HTx rats reinforced the idea that the abnormal and dysfunction of the SCO precedes the development of the hydrocephalus.|$|E
25|$|GAPDH {{has been}} implicated in several {{neurodegenerative}} diseases and disorders, largely through interactions with other proteins specific to that disease or disorder. These interactions may affect not only energy metabolism but also other GAPDH functions. For example, GAPDH interactions with beta-amyloid precursor protein (betaAPP) could interfere with its function regarding the cytoskeleton or membrane transport, while interactions with <b>huntingtin</b> could interfere with its function regarding apoptosis, nuclear tRNA transport, DNA replication, and DNA repair. In addition, nuclear translocation of GAPDH {{has been reported in}} Parkinson's disease (PD), and several anti-apoptotic PD drugs, such as rasagiline, function by preventing the nuclear translocation of GAPDH. It is proposed that hypometabolism may be one contributor to PD, but the exact mechanisms underlying GAPDH involvement in neurodegenerative disease remains to be clarified. The SNP rs3741916 in the 5' UTR of the GAPDH gene may be associated with late onset Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
500|$|HD is {{typically}} inherited from a person's parents, with 10% of cases {{due to a}} new mutation. The disease is caused by an autosomal dominant mutation in either of an individual's two copies of a gene called <b>Huntingtin.</b> This means a child of an affected person typically has a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The <b>Huntingtin</b> gene provides the genetic information for a protein that is also called [...] "huntingtin". Expansion of CAG (cytosine-adenine-guanine) triplet repeats in the gene coding for the <b>Huntingtin</b> protein results in an abnormal protein, which gradually damages cells in the brain, through mechanisms that are not fully understood. Diagnosis is by genetic testing, which {{can be carried out}} at any time, {{regardless of whether or not}} symptoms are present. This fact raises several ethical debates: the age at which an individual is considered mature enough to choose testing; whether parents have the right to have their children tested; and managing confidentiality and disclosure of test results.|$|E
500|$|An {{additional}} {{theory that}} explains another way cell function may be disrupted by HD proposes that damage to mitochondria in striatal cells (numerous accounts of mitochondrial metabolism deficiency have been found) and {{the interactions of}} the altered <b>huntingtin</b> protein with numerous proteins in neurons leads to an increased vulnerability of glutamine, which, in large amounts, {{has been found to}} be an excitotoxin. [...] Excitotoxins may cause damage to numerous cellular structures. [...] Although glutamine is not found in excessively high amounts, it has been postulated that because of the increased vulnerability, even normal amounts glutamine can cause excitotoxins to be expressed.|$|E
500|$|Research {{into the}} {{mechanism}} of HD has focused on identifying the functioning of HTT, how mHTT differs or interferes with it, and the brain pathology that the disease produces. Research is conducted using in vitro methods, animal models and human volunteers. Animal models are critical for understanding the fundamental mechanisms causing the disease and for supporting {{the early stages of}} drug development. Animals with chemically induced brain injury exhibit HD-like symptoms and were initially used, but they did not mimic the progressive features of the disease. [...] The identification of the causative gene has enabled the development of many transgenic animal models including nematode worms, Drosophila fruit flies, mice, rats, sheep, pigs and monkeys that express mutant <b>huntingtin</b> and develop progressive neurodegeneration and HD-like symptoms.|$|E
2500|$|Naa15, {{together}} with its catalytic subunit Naa10, constitutes the evolutionarily conserved NatA (Nα-acetyltransferase A) complex, which acetylates the α-amino {{group of the}} first amino acid residue of proteins starting with small side chains like serine, glycine, alanine, threonine and cysteine, after the initiator methionine has been cleaved by methionine aminopeptidases. Furthermore, Naa15 might act as a scaffold for other factors, including the chaperone like protein HYPK (<b>Huntingtin</b> Interacting Protein K) and Naa50, the catalytic acetyltransferase subunit of NatE ...|$|E
2500|$|RFLPs {{can be used}} to {{determine}} the origin and mechanism involved with Polysomy X and other chromosome heteromorphisms or chromosomes that differ in size, shape, or staining properties. [...] Restriction enzymes cut DNA at a specific site and the DNA fragments that are left are called restriction fragment length polymorphisms, or RFLPs. RFLP also aids in the identification of the <b>Huntingtin</b> (HTT) gene which is predictive of an adult-onset autosomal disorder called Huntington's disease (HD). Mutations in chromosome 4 are able to be visualized when RFLP is used in conjunction with Southern blot analysis.|$|E
2500|$|The alpha sheet {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a possible intermediate state in the conformational change {{in the formation of}} amyloid fibrils by peptides and proteins such as amyloid beta, poly-glutamine repeats, lysozyme, prion proteins, and transthyretin repeats, all of which are associated with protein misfolding disease. For example, amyloid beta is a major component of amyloid plaques in the brains of Alzheimer's disease patients, and polyglutamine repeats in the <b>huntingtin</b> protein are associated with Huntington's disease. These proteins undergo a conformational change from largely random coil or alpha helix structures to the highly ordered beta sheet structures found in amyloid fibrils. Most beta sheets in known proteins are [...] "twisted" [...] about 15° for optimal hydrogen bonding and steric packing; however, some evidence from electron crystallography suggests that at least some amyloid fibrils contain [...] "flat" [...] sheets with only 1-2.5° of twist. An alpha-sheet amyloid intermediate is suggested to explain some anomalous features of the amyloid fibrillization process, such as the evident amino acid sequence dependence of amyloidogenesis despite the belief that the amyloid fold is mainly stabilized by the protein backbone.|$|E
50|$|SETD2 {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with <b>Huntingtin.</b> Huntington's disease (HD), a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by loss of striatal neurons, is caused by an expansion of a polyglutamine tract in the HD protein <b>huntingtin.</b> SETD2 belongs to a class of <b>huntingtin</b> interacting proteins characterized by WW motifs.|$|E
50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{belongs to the}} ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme family. It binds {{selectively}} to a large region at the N terminus of <b>huntingtin.</b> This interaction is not influenced by {{the length of the}} <b>huntingtin</b> polyglutamine tract. This protein has been implicated in the degradation of <b>huntingtin</b> and suppression of apoptosis.|$|E
50|$|The <b>huntingtin</b> gene, {{also called}} the HTT or HD (Huntington disease) gene, is the IT15 ("interesting {{transcript}} 15") gene, which codes for a protein called the <b>huntingtin</b> protein. The gene and its product are under heavy investigation as part of Huntington's disease clinical research and the suggested role for <b>huntingtin</b> in long-term memory storage.|$|E
50|$|The {{function}} of <b>huntingtin</b> is unclear. It {{is essential for}} development, and absence of <b>huntingtin</b> is lethal in mice. The protein has no sequence homology with other proteins and is highly expressed in neurons and testes in humans and rodents. <b>Huntingtin</b> upregulates the expression of Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) at the transcription level, but the mechanism by which <b>huntingtin</b> regulates gene expression has not been determined. From immunohistochemistry, electron microscopy, and subcellular fractionation studies of the molecule, {{it has been found}} that <b>huntingtin</b> is primarily associated with vesicles and microtubules. These appear to indicate a functional role in cytoskeletal anchoring or transport of mitochondria. The Htt protein is involved in vesicle trafficking as it interacts with HIP1, a clathrin-binding protein, to mediate endocytosis, the trafficking of materials into a cell. <b>Huntingtin</b> has also been shown to have a role in the establishment in epithelial polarity through its interaction with RAB11A.|$|E
50|$|<b>Huntingtin</b> {{interacting}} protein-1 (HIP-1) is {{a protein}} that interacts with <b>huntingtin</b> (Htt), another protein that when is mutated (with expanded polyglutamine repeats) forms protein aggregates {{in the brain}} of patients with Huntington’s disease (HD).|$|E
50|$|The mass of <b>huntingtin</b> {{protein is}} {{dependent}} {{largely on the}} number of glutamine residues it has, the predicted mass is around 350 kDa. Normal <b>huntingtin</b> is generally accepted to be 3144 amino acids in size. The exact function of this protein is not known, but it {{plays an important role in}} nerve cells. Within cells, <b>huntingtin</b> may be involved in signaling, transporting materials, binding proteins and other structures, and protecting against programmed cell death (apoptosis). The <b>huntingtin</b> protein is required for normal development before birth. It is expressed in many tissues in the body, with the highest levels of expression seen in the brain.|$|E
50|$|Among the {{approaches}} {{aimed at improving}} cell survival {{in the presence of}} mutant <b>huntingtin</b> are correction of transcriptional regulation using histone deacetylase inhibitors, modulating aggregation of <b>huntingtin,</b> improving metabolism and mitochondrial function and restoring function of synapses.|$|E
50|$|Gene {{silencing}} {{can be used}} {{to treat}} HD by targeting the mutant <b>huntingtin</b> protein. The mutant <b>huntingtin</b> protein has been targeted through gene silencing that is allele specific using allele specific oligonucleotides. In this method, the antisense oligonucleotides are used to target single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs), which are single nucleotide changes in the DNA sequence, since HD patients have been found to share common SNPs that are associated with the mutated <b>huntingtin</b> allele. It has been found that approximately 85% of patients with HD can be covered when three SNPs are targeted. In addition, when antisense oligonucleotides were used to target an HD-associated SNP in mice, there was a 50% decrease in the mutant <b>huntingtin</b> protein.|$|E
50|$|PRPF40A {{has been}} shown to {{interact}} with <b>Huntingtin.</b>|$|E
50|$|Non-allele {{specific}} {{gene silencing}} using siRNA molecules {{has also been}} used to silence the mutant <b>huntingtin</b> proteins. Through this approach, instead of targeting SNPs on the mutated protein, all of the normal and mutated <b>huntingtin</b> proteins are targeted. When studied in mice, {{it was found that}} siRNA could reduce the normal and mutant <b>huntingtin</b> levels by 75%. At this level, they found that the mice developed improved motor control and a longer survival rate when compared to the controls. Thus, gene silencing methods may prove to be beneficial in treating HD.|$|E

50|$|Huntington's disease (HD) {{results from}} a {{mutation}} in the <b>huntingtin</b> gene that causes an excess of CAG repeats. The gene then forms a mutated <b>huntingtin</b> protein with polyglutamine repeats near the amino terminus. This disease is incurable and known to cause motor, cognitive, and behavioral deficits. Researchers have been looking to gene silencing as a potential therapeutic for HD.|$|E
