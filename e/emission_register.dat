40|$|Eco-efficiency links {{economic}} efficiency with environmental efficiency. The {{main purpose of}} the concept is to identify and implement activities to enable production that is both economically more efficient and cleaner. This means that parameters with a high indicative value have to be used. Since both the environmental and the economic performance of industries must be described concurrently, environmental intensity {{appears to be a}} good indicator of eco-efficiency. Environmental intensity is environmental impact per unit of economic performance. In this paper, the environmental impact of industry classes is derived from emission data, released by the European Pollutant <b>Emission</b> <b>Register</b> (EPER), and then aggregated and assessed using Eco-Indicator 99, a single-score life-cycle impact assessment (LCIA) method. The calculated ratio is thus an accurate description of the environmental-economic state of industry classes. The main advantage of this approach is the underlying consistent statistical framework, that permits, on a disaggregated level, economic data to be correlated with ecological data and to be frequently updated. This single indicator facilitates a comparison of environmental intensity of different industry classes. The paper shows {{that it is possible to}} deduce a disaggregated eco-efficiency indicator, which is exemplified using German data, however could be analysed for different European countries.

A further goal was to prepare the implementation of a national PRTR in Germany up {{to the development of a}} prototypic register. In the context of the project numerous PRTRs already existing were examined. Thus a contribution could be made to estimate the negotiating positions of the most important participants within the negotiations to PRTR-Protocol of the UN-ECE. For the arrangement of several PRTR problems different options could be analyzed and solutions be found negotiation-accompanying. The PRTR-Protocol was accepted after a nearly two-year negotiation process on 21 May 2003 as legally binding protocol under the Aarhus convention by the Meeting of the Parties and drawn by 36 states and the European community during the fifth conference of secretary of the environment "Environment for Europe" of the UNECE in Kiew. The protocol obligates the Contracting Parties for the setting up of national registers, which contain information about facility-specific emissions and waste transfers as well as about pollutants from diffuse sources as for example traffic or agriculture. The data of the facilities are to be made accessible to the public over an electronic data base - the register.

40|$|Abstract An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} examine experimentally the process of fragmentation of brittle materials (glass plates and quartz rods) under quasi-static and dynamic loading conditions. In the quasi-static tests of glass plates, two types of scaling laws were considered. Of these, one {{was based on the}} fractal relation similar to the Dielectric Breakdown Model or the Diffusion-limited Aggregation Model, and the other involved the definition of the fragment size distribution. The results of investigation indicate that fragment size distributions mainly follow power-law distributions. Variations in the fragmentation mechanism correlate with quantitative changes in the fractal dimension observed in different regions of the fragmented specimen. The dynamic fragmentation statistics was studied in the recovery experiments with quartz cylindrical rods. The mechanoluminescence-based method was used to measure the distribution of time quantities. Impact loading applied to specimens leads to the formation of fracture surfaces, which produces intensive light <b>emission</b> <b>registered</b> then by Photo Multiplayer Tubes. The data recovery technique allows us to save the fragments and to determine the size distribution of fragments.

Several parameters of chaotic dynamics were applied.

Methods This was an ecological study that modelled the Standardised Mortality Ratio (SMR) for lung cancer in 8073 Spanish towns over the period 1994 – 2003. Population exposure to industrial pollution was estimated on the basis of distance from town of residence to pollution source. An exploratory, near-versus-far analysis was conducted, using mixed Poisson regression models and an analysis of the effect of municipal proximity within a 50 -kilometre radius of each of the 18 installations. Results Results varied for the different facilities. In two instances there was an increasing mortality gradient with proximity to the installation, though this was exclusively observed among men. Conclusion The study of cancer mortality in areas surrounding pollutant foci is a useful tool for environmental surveillance, and serves to highlight areas of interest susceptible to being investigated by ad hoc studies.

40|$|In recent years, {{legislative}} requirements and environmental policies at European, {{as well as}} national, level seek to internalize the environmental impacts that have been traditionally viewed as externalities, in order {{to come up with}} more informed and fair choices. The IPPC (Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control) Directive 96 / 61 /EC lays down a framework requiring Member States to issue operating permits for certain installations based on best available techniques (BAT) in order to achieve a high level of protection of the environment. This framework gives clearly importance to economic aspects.

The analysis is based on pollutant emissions gathered by reports prepared for the European Pollutant <b>Emission</b> <b>Register</b> (EPER) and on external costs, in terms of euros per tonne of pollutant emitted, generated by European Programmes.

Populations having an industry within a radius of 1, 1. 5, or 2 kilometres from the municipal centroid were deemed to be exposed. Municipalities outside those radii were considered as reference populations. The relative risks (RRs) associated with proximity to pollutant industries were estimated using the following methods: Poisson Regression; mixed Poisson model with random provincial effect; and spatial autoregressive modelling (BYM model). Results Only proximity of paper industries to population centres (> 2 km) could be associated with a greater risk of NHL mortality (mixed model: RR: 1. 24, 95 % CI: 1. 09 – 1. 42; BYM model: RR: 1. 21, 95 % CI: 1. 01 – 1. 45; Poisson model: RR: 1. 16, 95 % CI: 1. 06 – 1. 27). Spatial models yielded higher estimates. Conclusion The reported association between exposure to air pollution from the paper, pulp and board industry and NHL mortality is independent of the model used. Inclusion of spatial random effects terms in the risk estimate improves the study of associations between environmental exposures and mortality. The EPER could be of great utility when studying the effects of industrial pollution on the health of the population. </p...|$|E
