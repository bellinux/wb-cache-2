Knowledge ("World 3 " in Karl Popper's term) is a sort of environment for human beings. As people more and more come to think that knowledge is an important factor for economic growth, the society comes to believe knowledge is capital. However, it is not easy to treat knowledge as capital. First of all, it is because knowledge creation is not economic production. In this paper, it is proposed that knowledge access should be focused instead. In addition, by drawing attention to striking similarities between expenditures for certain <b>intangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> and certain work-in-progress-type expenditures, it is suggested that the concept of <b>intangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> in the 1993 SNA may be better interpreted when you consider them as a special type of work-in-progress.

40|$|A {{recommendation}} from the {{revision of the}} System of National Accounts (SNA) 1993 is to include R&D as an <b>intangible</b> <b>fixed</b> <b>asset.</b> This reflects the increasing role of knowledge in the economy. The definition of an asset within the National Accounts is to deliver benefit to the owner {{for more than a}} year; a characteristic that R&D and other non technical activities often demonstrate. The result on the production account of capitalising intangible investments is to increase the level of GDP whilst providing more detailed data on the sources of productivity growth. Net wealth is increased as stocks of intangible assets are recorded in the balance sheet; as these stocks are used up they provide capital services to the asset owner. Therefore in order to ‘capitalise’ intangible investment within a national accounts framework it is necessary not only to estimate the levels of stock but also {{the rate at which the}} stocks depreciate and become obsolete over time. That is, to estimate their service lives. The purposes of this study are: - to seek answers on asset lives, using a framework developed by the OECD; - to test whether companies can provide data on non-technical innovation activities, in addition to data provided on conventional R&D...|$|R

This paper examines the assets write-off behaviour of Malaysian firms during debt renegotiation with lenders, following actual default in loan payment. This investigation is undertaken {{in the context of}} high government intervention and a lack of proper accounting standards on <b>intangible</b> and <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> write-offs. The results show that firms wrote off more assets {{in the first year of}} debt renegotiation with lenders compared with a control of sample of firms that were not involved in debt renegotiation. This result is robust after controlling for performance, audit qualification, audit quality, management changes, size and leverage in multivariate regression models. However, we find limited support that the firms undertaking renegotiation under government supervision write off assets more than the firms without government supervision. accounting choices; debt renegotiation; <b>fixed</b> assets; <b>intangible</b> assets; <b>assets</b> write-off; Malaysia; distressed firms; write-off behaviour; loan payment default; government intervention; accounting standards. ...|$|R

40|$|Data on {{physical}} capital are an indispensable part {{of economic growth}} and efficiency studies. In the case of China, economy-wide <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> series are usually derived by aggregating gross fixed capital formation (net of depreciation) over time, and sectoral/ownership-specific series by correcting the limited official <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> data available. These procedures, to varying degrees, ignore that (i) gross fixed capital formation does not equal investment, (ii) investment does not equal the value of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> newly created through investment, (iii) depreciation is an accounting measure that bears no necessary relation {{to changes in the}} production capacity of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets,</b> (iv) official <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> data, where available, incorporate significant revaluations in the 1990 s, and (v) "net fixed assets" do not measure the contribution of <b>fixed</b> <b>assets</b> to production. This paper derives economy-wide <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> values for 1953 - 2003, correcting for these shortcomings. It uses both the traditional, cumulative approach and a new, so far unexplored method of combining economy-wide depreciation values and an economy-wide depreciation rate to directly yield economy-wide <b>fixed</b> <b>assets.</b> The derived <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> time series are evaluated in a comparison with each other as well as with series in the literature, leading to the recommendation of a specific choice of <b>fixed</b> <b>asset</b> time series.
