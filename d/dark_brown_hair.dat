5|$|During the fall, elk grow a thicker coat of hair, {{which helps}} to {{insulate}} {{them during the}} winter. Males, females and calves of Siberian and North American elk all grow thin neck manes; female and young Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis do not. By early summer, the heavy winter coat has been shed, and elk are known to rub against trees and other objects to help remove hair from their bodies. All elk have small and clearly defined rump patches with short tails. They have different coloration based on the seasons and types of habitats, with gray or lighter coloration prevalent {{in the winter and}} a more reddish, darker coat in the summer. Subspecies living in arid climates tend to have lighter colored coats than do those living in forests. Most have lighter yellow-brown to orange-brown coats in contrast to <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> on the head, neck, and legs during the summer. Forest-adapted Manchurian and Alaskan wapitis have darker reddish-brown coats with less contrast between the body coat {{and the rest of the}} body during the summer months. Calves are born spotted, as is common with many deer species, and they lose their spots by the end of summer. Adult Manchurian wapiti may retain a few orange spots on the back of their summer coats until they are older. This characteristic has also been observed in the forest-adapted European red deer.|$|E

25|$|In late August, {{on behalf}} of the Bulgarian government, Interpol {{attempted}} to recruit the help of member nations to identify one of the suspects in the investigation, and posted on its website an image of the alleged accomplice, urging anyone who had information about his identity to notify the authorities. The posted images include a copy of the fake driver's license in which the suspect seems to be wearing a wig.

25|$|Gomez, a {{longtime}} journalist, recalls having met and interviewed Duke {{in the mid-1970s}} when Duke was a state senate candidate:He {{was still in his}} mid-20s and very non-descript. Tall and slimly built, he had a very prominent nose, flat cheek bones, a slightly receding chin and straight <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair.</b> The interview turned out to be quite innocuous, and I hadn't thought about it again until Duke came to my legislative desk, and we shook hands. Who was this guy? Tall and well-built with a perfect nose, a model's cheek bones, prominent chin, blue eyes and freshly coiffed blond hair, he looked like a movie star. He obviously didn't remember from the radio encounter, and I was content to leave it at that.Consistent with Gomez's observation, Duke in the latter 1980s reportedly had his nose thinned and chin augmented. Following his election to the Louisiana House of Representatives, he shaved his mustache.|$|E

25|$|He {{became known}} to the police under alias names 'John Fleming', 'John Webster', 'Charles Ferguson'. After being {{involved}} in the abortive raid on Chester Castle in February 1867, he evaded capture and was sent to the United States later that year at the age of 21 to discuss reorganisation of the Fenians. After his return he was arrested in Dublin on 17 February 1868 and spent five months in Kilmainham and Mountjoy jails. The County of Dublin Gaol, Kilmainham file holds a 'photograph and description of a prisoner who was formerly in custody under the Lord Lieutenant's warrant, charged with treasonable practices and discharged on bail on 29 July 1868.' John Power, alias John Webster, alias Charles Fleming was a Roman Catholic who was born in County Roscommon. He was 5ft 9in, 'stout', with a long face, <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair,</b> grey eyes, a large nose and a large mouth. His whiskers were dark and he had no beard. His fresh complexion was pitted and he had a large wart on the small finger of his left hand. His make was 'ordinary'. He was a newspaper reporter and lived in Lancashire, in Bolton or in Rochdale.|$|E
25|$|Two further {{unidentified}} {{males are}} estimated to have been killed between August and October 1976. One of these victims was buried directly above the body of William Carroll, who had been murdered on June 13, yet higher than the body of Rick Johnston, who was last seen on August 6. This particular unidentified male is estimated to have been aged between 15 and 24 {{years old and had}} light brown hair. Sequential burial patterns of victims within the crawl space, plus the circumstantial fact that Cram had not lived with Gacy before August 20, leave a possible date of between August 6 and August 20, 1976 as the time this particular man was murdered. The second unidentified male likely to have been murdered between August and October 1976 is a youth with <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair,</b> aged between 17 and 21 years old, who is known to have suffered from an abscessed tooth {{at the time of his}} murder. This male was buried in the northeast corner of the crawl space. Subsequent recollections by an employee of PDM Contractors of a trench Gacy had ordered him to dig on or before October 5, 1976, being the location where this particular victim was buried suggest a date between August and October 1976 as being when this man was murdered.|$|E

Anne was depicted to be [...] "sweet and cheerful" [...] in her youth and she enjoyed cards and dice games, drinking wine, eating French cuisine, flirting, gambling, gossiping, and hearing a good joke. She was fond of archery, falconry, hunting, and the occasional game of bowls. Yet Anne also had a sharp tongue and a terrible temper.|$|E
500|$|In {{designing}} the characters, the artists aimed for {{a style that}} was photorealistic. The creators envisaged the main protagonist, Nathan Drake, as more of an everyman character than Lara Croft, shown as clearly under stress in the game's many fire fights, with no special training and constantly living {{at the edge of}} his abilities. Director Amy Hennig felt a heavily armored, [...] "tough as nails" [...] protagonist with a large weapon was not a suitable hero, and decided a [...] "tenacious and resourceful" [...] character would portray more human qualities. Supporting characters (Elena Fisher and Victor Sullivan) were included to avoid a dry and emotionless story. Fisher's character underwent changes during development; in early trailers for the game, the character had <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair,</b> but ultimately the color changed to blonde and the style was altered.|$|E

50|$|Lateral {{branches}} are dendroid. Sheaths {{are covered}} in appressed, <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hairs</b> when young. Leaves are 10-35 x 2·5-6 cm., lanceolate to oblong-lanceolate, and obscurely tessellate. Leaf-blade apex is acuminate, while the base is broadly rounded, with a small petiole-like connection to the sheath. Leaf-blades are deciduous at the ligule. Culm-internodes are hollow and 5-10 cm. in diameter. Flowering patterns seem to be erratic, with gregarious flowering recorded in the Shire Highlands of Malawi, and annual flowering in the Usambara Mountains of Tanzania. The plants die after flowering.|$|R

500|$|On 13 May 1817, Pedro {{was married}} by proxy to Maria Leopoldina. When {{she arrived in}} Rio de Janeiro on 5 November, she {{immediately}} {{fell in love with}} Pedro, who was far more charming and attractive than she had been led to expect. After [...] "years under a tropical sun, his complexion was still light, his cheeks rosy." [...] The 19-year-old prince was handsome and a little above average in height, with bright dark eyes and <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair.</b> [...] "His good appearance", said historian Neill Macaulay, [...] "owed much to his bearing, proud and erect even at an awkward age, and his grooming, which was impeccable. Habitually neat and clean, he had taken to the Brazilian custom of bathing often." [...] The Nuptial Mass, with the ratification of the vows previously taken by proxy, occurred the following day. Seven children resulted from this marriage: Maria (later Queen Dona MariaII of Portugal), Miguel, João, Januária, Paula, Francisca and Pedro (later Emperor Dom PedroII of Brazil).|$|E
500|$|The 17-year-old PedroII was, for his part, {{clearly and}} greatly disappointed. His first {{impressions}} were only of her physical flaws—and {{of how much}} her appearance differed from the portrait which {{had been sent to}} him. Physically, she had <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> and brown eyes, was short, slightly overweight, walked with a pronounced limp and, while not ugly, neither was she pretty. According to historian Pedro Calmon, Teresa Cristina had no true limp, but her odd way of walking was instead the result of bowed legs causing her to lean alternately right and left as she walked. PedroII's high expectations were crushed, and he allowed his feelings of revulsion and rejection to show. After a short interval, he left the ship. Perceiving his disillusionment, she burst into tears, lamenting that [...] "the emperor did not like me!" [...] Although a proxy marriage had already been performed, an extravagant state wedding was held on 4 September at the cathedral in Rio de Janeiro.|$|E
500|$|In A Game of Thrones, Jon Snow is {{introduced}} as the 14-year-old bastard son of Eddard [...] "Ned" [...] Stark, Lord of Winterfell, and half-brother to Robb, Sansa, Arya, Bran and Rickon. Jon {{is described as}} having strong Stark features with a lean build, long face, <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> and grey eyes. Jon has the surname [...] "Snow" [...] (customarily used for illegitimate children in the North) and is resented by Ned's wife Catelyn, who views him as {{a constant reminder of}} Ned's infidelity. Jon is the same age as Robb and enjoys a warm relationship with his siblings, particularly the tomboy Arya (who resembles Jon and like him does not feel like she fits in). Ned treats Jon as much like his other children as propriety and his honor will allow. Still, as somewhat of an outsider, Jon has learned to be independent and to fend for himself when necessary. Jon idolizes his father, but is wounded by Ned's refusal to tell him about his mother. At the beginning of the story, Jon adopts the albino direwolf that he names Ghost. He later finds that at times he can [...] "inhabit" [...] the wolf and share its experiences.|$|E
50|$|The male has upperwings {{with broad}} <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> borders and spots and a {{background}} varying from {{white in the}} north to deep yellow in southern populations.

The underwings are less dimorphic, orange-brown with darker tips on the forewings and marbled light brown with a whitish lengthwise stripe on the hindwings in both sexes. The male's underwings have a wider whitish hindwing stripe and darker forewing tips, while the females have a more contrasting hindwing pattern. All four wings are bordered by a short fringe of alternating sections of white and <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hairs.</b> Bilateral gynandromorphs are easily recognized in this species.|$|R

500|$|He was {{subsequently}} {{cast as the}} title role in director Mark Rydell's 2001 TV biographical film James Dean. To immerse himself in the role, Franco {{went from being a}} non-smoker to smoking two packs of cigarettes a day, bleached his <b>dark</b> <b>brown</b> <b>hair</b> blond, and learned to ride a motorcycle as well as play guitar and the bongos. To have a greater understanding of Dean, Franco spent hours with two of Dean's associates. Other research included reading books on Dean and studying his movies. While filming James Dean, the actor, to get into character, cut off communication with his family and friends, as well as his then-girlfriend. [...] "It was a very lonely existence," [...] he notes. [...] "If I wasn't on a set, I was watching James Dean. That was my whole thinking. James Dean. James Dean." [...] Despite already being a fan of Dean, Franco feared he might be typecast if he'd captured the actor too convincingly. Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly wrote: [...] "Franco could have walked through the role and done a passable Dean, but instead gets under the skin of this insecure, rootless young man." [...] He received a Golden Globe Award and nominations for an Emmy Award and a Screen Actors Guild Award (SAG).|$|E
