5|$|Magnus pursues Worth {{throughout}} London to {{stop him}} from curing his daughter Imogene, who is meant to die in the timeline. During the pursuit she tries to avoid her past self, but fails to stop encountering Watson, who quickly discovers she is from his future, but he promises to keep quiet for the sake of preserving the timeline. When Worth chases Magnus later he accidentally kills Imogene, restoring the timeline. After killing Worth, Magnus ends up in hiding for the next 113 years before she can resurface to help Will dealing with a mass of Abnormals invading the surface. In the season finale, it is revealed that <b>Helen</b> <b>had</b> been secretly working with several important figures of the 20th Century, including Albert Einstein and Buckminster Fuller amongst others, and had built a new underground Sanctuary.|$|E
5|$|By 2January, {{the weak}} low moved over the Joseph Bonaparte Gulf where it slowly {{developed}} over the following day. Once over water, the Joint Typhoon Warning Center (JTWC) designated the system as Tropical Depression 09S. As organisation improved, a mid-level subtropical ridge over Western Australia pushed the system westward, away from the Kimberley coast. Steadily strengthening, the low attained gale-force winds near its centre during the morning of 4January and was subsequently named Helen by the Bureau of Meteorology. Shortly thereafter, a strong westerly monsoon flow to the north caused Helen to turn eastward, back towards land. Intensification continued up until landfall, by which time <b>Helen</b> <b>had</b> attained Category2 status on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale. Maximum ten-minute sustained winds reached 95km/h (60mph) and the storm's barometric pressure decreased to 975mbar (hPa; 28.79inHg). The JTWC assessed Helen to have been slightly weaker, with peak winds estimated at 85km/h (50mph).|$|E

25|$|Paris' {{abduction}} of <b>Helen</b> <b>had</b> several precedents. Io {{was taken}} from Mycenae, Europa {{was taken from}} Phoenicia, Jason took Medea from Colchis, and the Trojan princess Hesione had been taken by Heracles, who gave her to Telamon of Salamis. According to Herodotus, Paris was emboldened by these examples to steal himself a wife from Greece, and expected no retribution, since there had been none in the other cases.|$|E
25|$|The most {{beautiful}} woman in the world was Helen, one of the daughters of Tyndareus, King of Sparta. Her mother was Leda, who had been either raped or seduced by Zeus {{in the form of a}} swan. Accounts differ over which of Leda's four children, two pairs of twins, were fathered by Zeus and which by Tyndareus. However, Helen is usually credited as Zeus' daughter, and sometimes Nemesis is credited as her mother. <b>Helen</b> <b>had</b> scores of suitors, and her father was unwilling to choose one for fear the others would retaliate violently.|$|E
25|$|In his autobiography, Cushing {{implies that}} he {{attempted}} suicide {{on the night}} of his wife's death by running up and down stairs in the vain hope that it would induce a heart attack. He later stated that this had simply been a hysterical response borne out of grief, and that he had not purposely attempted to end his life; a poem left by <b>Helen</b> <b>had</b> implored him not to die until he had lived his life to the full, and he had resolved that to commit suicide would have meant letting her down. Although not conventionally religious, Cushing maintained a belief both in God and an afterlife. Cushing's colleagues of that period commented on his deeply Christian faith and his conviction that his separation from his wife was only temporary.|$|E

25|$|While she {{was still}} an infant, Helen's father died from influenza. Helen was raised by her mother, who often blamed her husband's death on the birth of Helen. She {{believed}} that God had taken her husband because she had wished so much for a baby girl. <b>Helen</b> <b>had</b> three older brothers: Harry, Ed, and Sam. The family relocated to Brooklyn when Helen was in her early teenage years. Her mother married a house painter, a man that Helen disliked. Soon, Helen's mother and stepfather turned the family's home into a brothel. At age 14, Helen was nearly raped by her stepfather. Helen defended herself with a kitchen knife, injuring him. Following this, she was permitted by her mother {{to live with her}} piano teacher, Honey Silverman, and her family.

Anxious to find a career in singing, Helen {{dropped out of high school}} to pursue her dream.|$|E
500|$|Oliver was {{sometimes}} characterised as reclusive {{in both the}} artistic and social worlds. Her teacher and long-time associate Professor Ian Howard described her as having [...] "an underlying and at times painful distrust of the relationships {{that are part of}} our everyday lives". Close friend and gallerist, Roslyn Oxley, observed that she was [...] "very private. She stopped people entering her world a lot of the time." [...] Oliver's sister, <b>Helen,</b> <b>had</b> described her as a [...] "powerful and fragile person" [...] while biographer Fink observed [...] " [...] deeply asocial person, [...] nonetheless maintained longstanding friendships with a small coterie of people whom she trusted". The final period of Oliver's personal life was the subject of contradictory accounts. Oxley said that Oliver in 2006 experienced the end of a 20-year-long relationship, and obituarist Joyce Morgan, who spoke to Huon Hooke after Oliver's death, described Hooke as Oliver's [...] "former" [...] partner. though others writing shortly after her death did not indicate that the relationship with Hooke had ended, including an obituary by Howard, one written by art critic John McDonald, and tributes by her two biographers, Felicity Fenner and Hannah Fink.|$|E

2500|$|In {{addition}} to tracking down and destroying any copy of Poems and Rhymes Around the World, the foursome {{hope to find}} a [...] "grimoire", a hypothesized spellbook that {{is the source of}} the culling spell. Streator wants to destroy it, believing that the knowledge contained in it is too dangerous, while the others in his group want to learn what other spells it contains—partly in the hope that there is a spell to resurrect the dead. The group eventually abandons Oyster on the side of the highway after he assaults Helen in an attempt to learn the culling spell. Mona eventually figures out that the datebook <b>Helen</b> <b>had</b> been carrying throughout the trip is the grimoire they had been looking for, written in invisible ink. <b>Helen</b> <b>had</b> acquired it years earlier in the estate of the publisher of Poems and Rhymes Around the World whom she had killed with the culling spell as revenge for the deaths of her husband and child.|$|E

Edgar [...] proposed to Helen on her 25th birthday, but she declined his offer. She didn't want their marriage to suffer because of her [...] "author psychology" [...] as she was working on a book. Several months later, Ed proposed once again and Helen accepted. The couple married on Christmas Day in 1932. The Snows would remain in China for nearly a decade.|$|E
2500|$|Herodotus adds {{weight to}} the [...] "Egyptian" [...] version of events by putting forward his own evidence—he {{traveled}} to Egypt and interviewed the priests of the temple (Foreign Aphrodite, ξείνη Ἀφροδίτη) at Memphis. [...] According to these priests, <b>Helen</b> <b>had</b> arrived in Egypt shortly after leaving Sparta, because strong winds had blown Paris's ship off course. [...] King Proteus of Egypt, appalled that Paris had seduced his host's wife and plundered his host's home in Sparta, disallowed Paris from taking Helen to Troy. [...] Paris returned to Troy without a new bride, but the Greeks refused to believe that Helen was in Egypt and not within Troy's walls. [...] Thus, Helen waited in Memphis for ten years, while the Greeks and the Trojans fought. [...] Following {{the conclusion of the}} Trojan War, Menelaus sailed to Memphis, where Proteus reunited him with Helen.|$|E
