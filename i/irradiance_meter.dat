40|$|Abstract: The {{study is}} based on the {{satellite}} estimation and ground measurements of solar UV index in Kathmandu for the year 2009. Kathmandu (27. 720 N, 85. 320 E) is located at an elevation of 1350 m from the sea level. The ground based measurement and satellite estimation was performed by NILU-UV <b>irradiance</b> <b>meter</b> and EOS Aura OMI spacecraft. The NILU-UV <b>irradiance</b> <b>meter</b> measures UV radiation in different spectral range. The Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) is a spectrometer designed to monitor solar radiation in spectral range of (270 - 500) nm. This study shows that satellite overestimates the ground based (GB) UV Index (UVI) before monsoon by 103. 6 % whereas during the monsoon period overestimation comes down to 70. 8 %. The correlation coefficient (r) between ozone column from satellite and ground based measurement before monsoon and after monsoon is also studied. It is observed that the correlation between satellite estimated ozone column and ground based ozone column before and after monsoon is 0. 83. The study showed that the estimation of OMI before monsoon is high than after monsoon...|$|E
40|$|The {{accuracy}} of remote sensing algorithms for phytoplankton biomass and physiology {{is difficult to}} test under natural conditions due to rapid changes in physical and biological forcings and the practical inability to manipulate nutrient conditions and phytoplankton composition in the sea. Therefore, an indoor mesocosm was designed to examine the optical properties of phytoplankton under controlled and manipulated conditions of irradiance, temperature, turbulence, and nutrient availability. Equipped with hyperspectral radiometers and bottom <b>irradiance</b> <b>meters,</b> it is shown that under semi-natural environmental conditions biogeochemically relevant species as Emiliania huxleyi and Phaeocystis globosa can be grown with good precision (+/- 20 %) between duplicate mesocosms and between duplicate sensors (< 5 % deviation). The {{accuracy of}} chlorophyll estimates by absorption, using an Integrating Cavity Absorption Meter, and fluorescence using water-leaving radiance was 74 % to 80 %, respectively, as it was negatively influenced by changes in phytoplankton physiology. Biomass detection was limitedto 1 to 2 mu g chlorophyll/L with an apparent linearity to 50 mu g chlorophyll/L. Estimates of the quantum efficiency of fluorescence (phi approximate to 0. 01) were comparable to real-world estimates derived from satellite observations. It is concluded that the mesocosms adequately simulate natural conditions with sufficient accuracy and precision and that they offer an important tool in validating assumptions and hypotheses underlying remote sensing algorithms and models...|$|R
40|$|Current {{uncertainty}} {{requirements for}} the measurement of global variables relevant to climate change modeling in the reflected solar range are 0. 5 % to 1 % for solar and lunar spectral irradiance and 0. 5 % to 2 % for Earth reflected radiance. Future uncertainty requirements, as defined by CLARREO mission requirements, include laboratory calibration uncertainties are 0. 2 % over the 500 nm to 900 nm spectral range and 1 % or less {{over the rest of}} the spectral region from 320 nm to 2300 nm. The uncertainties in lamp-illuminated integrating spheres, a principal calibration artifact, ranging from 2 % to 3 % in the visible to near-infrared and 3 % to 5 % in the short-wave infrared, do not meet either current or future uncertainty requirements. NIST uncertainties in broad-band lamp-based calibration artifacts are traceable to primary standard blackbodies. The irradiance and radiance responsivity scales disseminated by the NIST laser-based SIRCUS calibration facility are held by primary standard <b>irradiance</b> <b>meters</b> traceable to the Primary Optical Watt Radiometer and dimensional metrology from the NIST Aperture Area Facility. The SIRCUS facility has demonstrated that moving from source-based scales traceable to primary standard blackbodies to detector-based scales offer opportunities to reduce the uncertainties in disseminated standards. This presentation discusses existing primary radiometric standards and the uncertainties in detector-based radiance and irradiance scales, validation of their uncertainty budgets through measurements of primary standard metal melting point blackbodies, development of low temperature active cavity radiometers operating in irradiance mode, and the development of transfer standard spectrographs. Finally, this paper discusses possible further developments at NIST aimed at supporting future climate benchmark instrument uncertainty requirements...|$|R
40|$|Relatively {{great number}} of {{detected}} and confirmed oil spillages in the Polish marine areas reveals that discharge of oil substances from any one of a l arge number of ships to the marine environment is real in any time. Surface oil contamination can be easily detected by satellite or airborne radar techniques, but unfortunately oil dispersed in the bulk of water cannot be detected at the present. Discharge waters usually contain small amounts of oil substances {{in the form of}} dispersed droplets (emulsion). It is revealed that oil emulsion cause measurable changes in the optical properties of seawater. In practice, detection of changes of these properties should be possible by the standard radiance or <b>irradiance</b> reflectance <b>meter.</b> This paper presents a computed photon trace simulation applied to the marine environment polluted by oil-in-water emulsion. Model of marine area consists of whether conditions, sun elevation, sea depth, optical properties of seawater related to various transparency/turbidity: from clean oceanic waters to t urbid coastal seawater (as wat er from Gulf of GdaĔsk is). Model of oil pollution is repres ented by oil droplets size distribution and by spectra of both attenuation-coefficient and refraction-coefficient related to tw o optically absolutely different kinds of oil.

40|$|An {{empirical}} method {{was developed to}} measure how solar and atmospheric conditions affect Landsat images by comparing Landsat MSS data with terrain reflectance. Terrain reflectance was measured with a four-channel radiometer designed to measure radiance in wavelength bands matched to the Landsat MSS data. Other instrumentation included a digital data logger, an <b>irradiance</b> <b>meter,</b> and a video camera with recorder. Reflectance of many terrain elements which could be registered to the Landsat digital data were measured from a low-flying aircraft. Correlations of reflectance with Landsat radiance verified a linear atmospheric model with an additive (path radiance) term and a multiplicative (transmittance) term.

40|$|The {{spectral}} distributions {{in the sea}} near Hakodate in Hokkaido are obtain-ed by an <b>irradiance</b> <b>meter</b> {{with the}} calibrations of the absolute spectral response and the immersion effect correction. As for the measured results of the downward underwater irradiance, the spectral distribution in the surface layer is asymmetric and the peak energy is observed near 500 mfL. As depth increases, the longer wave light more than 600 mfL decreases rapidly and the peak shifts slowly towards the shorter wave-length. The spectral distribution of the upward irradiance is symmetric even in the surface layer. The peak of energy is observed at a shorter wavelength rather than the downward irradiance. The theoretical downward irradiance is calculated {{on the basis of}} Kishino's method. Theoretical results agree well with the measured values at every water depth...|$|E

40|$|The {{nature of}} organs neoformed from tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum cv Samsun) thin cell layers is {{influenced}} by the quantity of light supplied and on the sequence of this supply. It is observed that glucose exhibits similar effects. In the presence of glucose at 167 millimolar, continuous light of 50 watts per square meter is required for optimal flower differentiation in vitro. However, 50 watts per square <b>meter</b> <b>irradiance</b> limited to 6 days is sufficient to trigger flower formation in 80 % of the explants provided that light is applied from day 6 to day 11 of culture. This critical phase may correspond to the initiation phase during which soluble sugars are mainly needed as carbon energy source rather than as osmoregulators. Under continuous or precise sequential sugar deprivations, either no organogenesis occurs, or abnormal structures or buds are formed. Therefore, light per se is not sufficient to induce flower differentiation. Conversely, a specific quantitative combination of glucose and sucrose almost substitutes for the light requirement for differentiation of anthers and pistils. These observations suggest that, during the sequence of events leading to flower differentiation, light acts on energy-dependent sugar uptake and metabolism and on the increase of reducing potential of chloroplasts...|$|R
40|$|Vicarious {{calibration}} {{methods have}} been developed to calibrate radiometric sensors in-flight. One such method, the irradiance-based method, requires the measurement of the diffuse-to-global (diffuse-to-total) irradiance ratio. Diffuse/global irradiance measurements may also be used to deduce atmospheric descriptors and provide a comparison with atmospheric modeling predictions. I describe the design, construction, calibration, and application of a spectral diffuse/global <b>irradiance</b> <b>meter</b> that can accomplish these objectives in this dissertation. I develop general integrating sphere theory, modeling methods, and describe the resultant computer model. The model results agreed with theory to better than 1 % for a simple unbaffled integrating sphere. I applied the model to design an interior baffled integrating sphere-based cosine collector. I developed a method of tolerating the thermal expansion of Spectralon® and the collector was constructed. Measurements of the collector angular response agreed with the model predictions to better than 4 % for input zenith angles from 0 ° to 70 °. The resulting instrument is automated and collects diffuse and global irradiance from 300 nm to 1100 nm. It has a nominal 12 nm full-width at half-maximum bandpass and has a minimum sampling interval of 1 nm. I estimate the uncertainty of the measurements to be 3. 2 %. The largest contributor to the total uncertainty is the measurement uncertainty of the diffuse irradiance at 2. 5 %. The instrument was used in a field experiment. Optical depths derived from the diffuse/global irradiance measurements agreed with those derived from a solar radiometer to within 0. 008. Diffuse-to-global irradiance measurements made by the instrument were compared with an independent method and found to generally agree within 6 %. The measurements were consistently lower than radiative transfer modeling estimates. Top of the atmosphere relative radiances computed from the two independent diffuse-to-global irradiance data sets generally agreed to better than the 2. 9 % uncertainty associated with the diffuse/global <b>irradiance</b> <b>meter</b> data set. The relative radiances of the diffuse/global data set collected with the instrument were within the 4. 9 % uncertainty estimate of the reflectance-based method...|$|E

Monthly and seasonal variations of global solar radiation as well as correlation between clearness index and cloud transmittance factor at Lukla are presented. The annual average daily global solar radiation is about 3. 83 kWh/sq·m/day which is sufficient to promote solar active and passive energy technology at high mountain terrain where there is no other viable alternative sources of energy. The maximum and minimum global solar radiation of 5. 33 and 2. 08 kWh/sq·m/day is recorded in April and September 2010 respectively. The seasonal variation of solar energy is about 2. 87 kWh/sq·m/day and 4. 83 kWh/sq·m/day in summer and spring respectively which is not in line with the general trend. The coefficient of determination (R 2 ) between cloud transmittance factor (cf) and clearness factor (K) is found to be 0. 97.

Underwater spectral irradiance {{was measured with}} a specially designed underwater <b>irradiance</b> <b>meter</b> and the specific absorption coefficient of phytoplankton was determined by a modified opal glass method. The light utilization efficiency of phytoplankton at each depth was derived from photosynthetically fixed energy divided by the energy penetrating into that depth, and quantum yield was estimated from photosynthetic rate divided by quanta absorbed by phytoplankton. Vertical profiles of in situ photosynthetic rates per unit volume of water showed two peaks, the first at the depth of about 30 % light level (ca. 45, 000 cal m- 2 h-l) and the second at the depth of about 1. 5 % light level (ca. 2, 500 cal m- 2 h-r) with about the same rates.

40|$|The {{description}} of a novel device to measure the spectral direct normal irradiance is presented. The solar spectral <b>irradiance</b> <b>meter</b> (SSIM) was designed at the University of Ottawa as a cost-effective alternative to a prohibitively expensive field spectroradiometer (FSR). The latter measures highly-varying and location-dependent solar spectrum, which is essential for accurate characterization of a concentrating photovoltaic system’s performance. The SSIM measures solar spectral irradiance in several narrow wavelength bands {{with a combination of}} photodiodes with integrated interference filters. This device performs spectral measurements {{at a fraction of the}} cost of a FSR, but additional post-processing is required to deduce the solar spectrum. The model was developed to take the SSIM’s inputs and reconstruct the solar spectrum in 280 – 4000 nm range. It resolves major atmospheric processes, such as air mass changes, Rayleigh scattering, aerosol extinction, ozone and water vapour absorptions. The SSIM was installed at the University of Ottawa’s CPV testing facility in September, 2013. The device gathered six months of data from October, 2013 to March, 2014. The mean difference between the SSIM and the Eppley pyrheliometer was within ± 1. 5 % for cloudless periods in October, 2013. However, interference filter degradation and condensation negatively affected the performance of the SSIM. Future design changes will improve the longterm reliability of the next generation SSIMs...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the field test efficiency of grid connected solar PV system by simulation, field test results and real time data monitoring. The real behavior of modules by respect to the specifications was one of the greater uncertainties in the PV system performance evaluation. The reason is the mismatch of poor cell by the manufacturer during fabrication. The thesis demonstrates the performance analysis of solar module by using solar module analyzer, <b>irradiance</b> <b>meter</b> and inclinometer under different irradiation at site. The peak power produced is measured and compared with the manufacturing test report to ensure all the modules in the string will have power rating at the acceptable tolerance. The real time monitoring is implemented by using Solar-Log in order to obtain the absolute maximum performance from the solar energy system at all time. The real time data is recorded and compare with the PVSYST simulation results. Results obtained were compared to validate the efficiency of PV system. Finally, economic analysis of PV system is presented by using simple payback method to determine the return on investment (ROI). At the end of study, recommendation and suggested solution will be presented to increase the reliable and efficiency of photovoltaic (PV) system. By increasing the efficiency of PV system, more energy will be generated which contribute to a better return of investment (ROI). Hence, the renewable energy will becomes a viable and sound long term investment for companies, industries and also for individuals...|$|E
40|$|The {{spectral}} irradiance distribution at five stations on {{lakes and}} at sea {{was measured with}} a portable underwater spectral <b>irradiance</b> <b>meter.</b> Chlorophyll a concentration and the absorption coefficient of the water were concurrently measured. From measured spectral irradiance distri-butions, radiant energy absorbed per unit volume was computed. At these stations, the effect of upward irradiance on total quanta absorbed by the water was negligibly small for all layers. The relative contributions of phytoplankton, detritus, dissolved organic matter, and pure water to the total absorbed quanta were also computed by taking into consideration the spectral dependency of each component: the contribution of quanta absorbed by phytoplankton was about 3 - 10 % in clear water and about 30 - 40 % in the plankton-rich water. Underwater spectral energy distribution has been measured by various types of ir-radiance meters in various locations and depths (Tyler and Smith 1970; Morel 1973; Smith 1973; Okami et al. 1978, 198 1). In both lakes and seas not only the intensity but also the spectral composition of light varies largely with depth, area, and season. Dubinsky and Berman (1976) and Spitzer (1980) measured spectral distribution and primary production simultaneously and evaluated the efficiency,of utilization of ra-diant energy and quantum yield. In their calculations, however, neither the spectral composition of the light available for pho-tosynthesis nor the spectral dependency of phytoplankton absorption was taken into consideration. Since the variation of spec-tral available energy in water is large and since phytoplankton absorbs light with spectral selectivity, quantum yield should be computed by taking into consideration these spectral parameters, as was pointe...|$|E
