50|$|When {{dealing with}} asphalt overlays, {{reflection}} cracks can arise and cause an unwanted crack pattern beneath the pavement. Rubber-modified asphalt uses stress absorbing membranes that reduce the reflective cracking {{because of its}} elastic properties.

The pavement has an increased lifespan because after multiple uses and exposure to different elements, regular asphalt loses elasticity over time.

5000|$|It is {{described}} by American Society for Testing and Materials as follows: [...] "Segregation in concrete is commonly thought as separation of some size groups of aggregates from cement mortar in isolated locations with corresponding deficiencies of these materials in other locations. Segregation results in proportions of the laid concrete being in variation to those as designed. Segregation could result from internal factors such as concrete that is not proportioned properly and not mixed adequately, or too workable a mix. It also could result from external factors such as too much vibration, improper transportation, placement, or adverse weather conditions. [...] The corresponding increase in proportion of cement paste in upper areas would tend to make them susceptible to increased shrinkage and <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cracks.</b> These cracks could be 10 µm to 500 µm wide, formed perpendicular to the surface, and be {{in the form of}} map patterns." ...|$|E

50|$|Horgan and Young (2000) {{produced}} {{a computer model}} to create a two-dimensional prediction <b>of</b> surface <b>crack</b> <b>formation.</b> It used the fact that once cracks come within a certain distance of one another {{they tend to be}} attracted to each other. Cracks also tend to turn within a particular range of angles and at some stage a surface aggregate gets to a size that no more cracking will occur. These are often characteristic of a soil and can therefore be measured in the field and used in the model.

5000|$|Shear {{yielding}} {{theory is}} one that, like matrix crazing, {{can account for}} a large fraction {{of the increase in}} energy absorption of a toughened polymer. Evidence of shear yielding in a toughened polymer can be seen where there is [...] "necking, drawing or orientation hardening." [...] Shear yielding will result if rubber particles act as stress concentrators and initiate volume-expansion through crazing, debonding and cavitation, to halt the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cracks.</b> Overlapping stress fields from one particle to its neighbor will contribute to a growing shear-yielding region. The closer the particles are the more overlap and the larger shear-yielding region. Shear yielding is an energy absorbing process in itself, but furthermore initiation of shear bands also aids in craze arrest. The occurrence of cavitation is important to shear yielding theory because it acts to lower the yield stress. Cavitation precedes shear yielding, however shear yielding accounts for a much larger increase in toughness than does the cavitation itself.|$|E
5000|$|Steel Qualities and Quenchant: Blacksmith skill {{aside and}} {{specific}} heat treatment aside, the 1 versions (higher carbon) are harder, more wear resistant, more fragile {{and harder to}} forge, harder to sharpen, and harder to straighten.. The 3 versions (lower carbon, at the eutectoid point) are not necessarily softer, but often tougher, easier to sharpen, and easier to make. Blue steel {{is more difficult to}} forge, sharpen, and straighten (because the [...] "soft" [...] steel covered by clay still hardens). To perform traditional water quench on this steel can exacerbate the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> because of its deeper hardening. White steel 1 is difficult to forge and to quench from its higher carbon and can become harder and more brittle than White 2. A water quench with these traditional steels and processes will result in a blade that is harder, stiffer, sharper with longer lasting sharpness but that is harder to sharpen and relatively less tough. An oil quench with the same steels will result in a blade that is marginally less hard, stiff, sharp with less lasting sharpness but that is easier to sharpen and more tough. The choice of quenchant depends on user preference of blade qualities.|$|E
50|$|In 1985, i.e. 130 {{years after}} the {{erection}} of the monuments, experts from the Dresden Office for Monument Conservation (VEB Denkmalpflege Dresden) questioned the structural stability of the columns during an inspection. Five years later, following an emergency meeting on 11 September 1990 in Putbus, a Berlin master stonemason and restorer was contracted to remove both monuments. In late November 1991, the monuments were dismantled and their drums, capitals and statues transported to the master stonemason's workshop in Berlin-Pankow. Originally replicas of the drums, capitals and statues were to be made, because the advice had been not to repair them due to the severe damage to the original stone. The drums had once been joined together by means of iron pins. Serious corrosion of these jointing pins over many decades had caused the granite to split in places, which meant {{there had been a}} danger of the columns collapsing as result of the <b>formation</b> <b>of</b> <b>cracks</b> and fissures. The statues, too, were so badly eroded by weathering and lightning strikes, that their outline had been destroyed for ever.
