5|$|Before the Dumbarton and San Mateo-Hayward Bridges {{were built}} across the San Francisco Bay in the 1920s, San Francisco was bottled {{up at the}} north end of a long peninsula, with driving south on <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> <b>Real</b> towards San Jose as the only {{reasonable}} alternative to the ferries for crossing the bay. The first of several highways built as an alternate to <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> <b>Real</b> was the Skyline Boulevard, which was added to the state highway system in 1919. A second route, the Bay Shore Highway (Route 68), became a state highway in 1923, but only from the San Francisco city limits into San Mateo County, where the Dumbarton Bridge would begin. Just prior to the start of construction on the Dumbarton Bridge, San Francisco Supervisor Richard J. Welch noted that the Bay Shore Highway would need to be built all the way to San Jose as an escape valve for the additional traffic that the bridge would attract.|$|E
5|$|The Bayshore Freeway {{is a part}} of U.S. Route 101 (US 101) in the San Francisco Bay Area of the U.S. {{state of}} California. It runs along the west shore of the San Francisco Bay, {{connecting}} San Jose with San Francisco. Within the city of San Francisco, the freeway is also known as James Lick Freeway, named after the California philanthropist. The road was originally built as a surface road, the Bayshore Highway, and later upgraded to freeway standards. Before 1964, it was mostly marked as U.S. Route 101 Bypass, with US 101 using the present State Route 82 (<b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> <b>Real).</b>|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} Inca road was the <b>Camino</b> <b>Real</b> (Royal Road), {{as it is}} known in Spanish, with a length of 5200 km. It began in Quito, Ecuador, passed through Cusco, and ended in what is now Tucumán, Argentina. The <b>Camino</b> <b>Real</b> traversed the mountain ranges of the Andes, with peak altitudes of more than 5000 m. <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> de la Costa, the coastal trail, with a length of 4000 km, ran parallel to the sea and was linked with the <b>Camino</b> <b>Real</b> by many smaller routes.|$|R

5|$|When the Bayshore Highway was {{completed}} in 1937, U.S. Route 101 signs were moved to it from <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> <b>Real,</b> and El Camino became U.S. Route 101 Alternate. Businesses along El Camino created the <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> <b>Real</b> Association to protest the move and resulting loss of business, and by 1939 the main route had been moved back, with the Bayshore Highway becoming U.S. Route 101 Bypass. The two routes split in San Jose at the junction of First and Second Streets near Keyes Street, with the El Camino route mostly following the present SR 82 and the Bayshore route using locally maintained Second, Reed, and Fourth Streets to reach the state-maintained Bayshore Highway. In San Francisco, they rejoined at the present location of the Alemany Maze, with the El Camino route following Alemany Boulevard from near the city line; from there US 101 continued north on Bay Shore Boulevard, Potrero Avenue, and 10th and Fell Streets to Van Ness Avenue, meeting the Bay Bridge approach (US 40/US 50) at Bryant and Harrison Streets. The Bryant/Harrison one-way pair was added to Route 68 (which already included the bridge) in 1937 and removed in 1947 along with the bridge; in 1961 the new freeway approach became part of Route 68, which was extended back over the bridge to Route 5 at its Oakland landfall.|$|E
5|$|In May 1769, Gaspar de Portolà {{established}} the Fort Presidio of San Diego {{on a hill}} near the San Diego River. It was the first settlement by Europeans {{in what is now}} the state of California. In July of the same year, Mission San Diego de Alcalá was founded by Franciscan friars under Junípero Serra. By 1797, the mission boasted the largest native population in Alta California, with over 1,400 neophytes living in and around the mission proper. Mission San Diego was the southern anchor in California of the historic mission trail <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> <b>Real.</b> Both the Presidio and the Mission are National Historic Landmarks.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the Emerald Drive interchange was scheduled for the year 1971. While the <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> <b>Real</b> interchange was already a diamond interchange, the state planned to add traffic signals to the ramps to accommodate more congestion from the nearby mall. The Emerald Drive interchange was completed in September, {{and the rest of}} the project was to be completed by the end of the year, leaving Jefferson Drive as the only remaining traffic signal. Construction on the Jefferson Street interchange began in early 1972; the section from I-5 east to Melrose Drive (along the routing of the Vista Way Freeway) had been upgraded to full freeway standards as of 1973.|$|E

5|$|Construction of an {{extension}} to Route 115 (Santa Clara Street, now SR 130) at 30th Street in San Jose began in 1939, and {{was completed by}} late 1940. As with the portion between Fourth and 13th Streets, it was not marked as a numbered route. The state legislature authorized {{an extension}} beyond San Jose back to <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> <b>Real</b> near Ford Road in 1947, which was already under construction, and was completed that year. This was the first segment built with interchanges, and included a median barrier. Despite this, most crossings were at-grade; only the two ends at Route 115 (Santa Clara Street) and regular US 101 included bridges, the former a diamond interchange and the latter a simple split with additional access to Ford Road. It also crossed over Coyote Road, though with no access, {{just south of the}} Coyote Creek bridge. The original 1947 bridge over Coyote Road remains, though widened in 1990, {{and is one of the}} oldest road-road grade separations on the present freeway.|$|E
5|$|From I-5 to I-15, SR76 {{is part of}} the California Freeway and Expressway System, but is {{not part}} of the National Highway System, a network of {{highways}} that are considered essential to the country's economy, defense, and mobility by the Federal Highway Administration. SR76 is legally eligible for the State Scenic Highway System, but it is not officially designated as a scenic highway by the California Department of Transportation. The part of the highway from the western terminus to Douglas Drive is also named for Tony Zeppetella, an Oceanside police officer killed while on duty performing a traffic stop in 2003. In 2014, SR76 had an annual average daily traffic (AADT) of 1,400 between East Palomar Road and the eastern terminus at SR79, and 55,000 between Airport Road and <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> <b>Real</b> in Oceanside, the latter of which was the highest AADT for the highway.|$|E
5|$|In April 1982, {{the first}} Nationals {{was held at}} Loyola Marymount University in California—16 states and the District of Columbia participated. However, the competition's founder, Dr. Robert Peterson, was {{inspired}} by the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. He hoped to make Academic Decathlon an international event, and so at the 1984 Nationals, Canada, Mexico, and New Zealand fielded teams in addition to teams from 32 U.S. states. The inclusion of foreign countries did not become a regular occurrence, however. There was no more international participation until 1989, when teams from Northern Ireland and Rio de Janeiro competed. Since then, {{no more than a few}} teams a year have competed at Nationals. Since the first national event in 1982, only three states have ever won the National Competition: California, Texas, and Wisconsin, with California having won the majority of the National Competitions. <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> <b>Real</b> High School from California currently holds the record for the most wins, having won its sixth national title in 2010.

5|$|The roadway {{carrying}} the SR76 designation begins at County Route S21 (CRS21) in Oceanside, although Caltrans {{does not consider}} the road west of I-5 {{to be part of}} the route, and it is not in the legal definition.

From I-5 to Mission Avenue, the highway parallels the San Luis Rey River until it passes by Oceanside Municipal Airport. During this stretch, SR76 intersects Loretta Street, Canyon Drive, Benet Road, Airport Road, and Foussat Road. There are two overpasses: one over Mission Avenue, and one over <b>El</b> <b>Camino</b> <b>Real,</b> before the road intersects Douglas Drive, the main road to the San Luis Rey gate of Camp Pendleton.
