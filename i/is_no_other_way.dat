5|$|This supreme, states Kaivalya Upanishad, is the eternal, the all-pervading, formless, unmanifest, infinite, inconceivable, {{one without}} {{beginning}} or middle or end, {{one which is}} chidananda ("consciousness-bliss"). He is, states the Upanishad, Brahman, Shiva, Indra, Vishnu, Prana (life force, breath), fire and moon (time, lunar calendar). Eternity is him, states the text, all that originated is him, all that originates is him. Know him, find liberation, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way,</b> states verse 9.|$|E
5|$|Utmost {{necessity}} may {{be invoked}} where an interest {{protected by the}} Criminal Code (such as right to property or right to life) is endangered. An example of necessity would be a defense against a raging dog (unless the dog was directly sent by the owner, which would be case of necessary defense). The necessity may be invoked only in case of imminent danger and only if there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> of avoiding it (subsidiarity), such as locking oneself behind a fence or calling the police. Also, the consequence of the necessity must be less serious than the consequence of the endangering act (proportionality).|$|E
5|$|Bart gladly accepts Martin's offer, {{as there}} <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> {{he could win}} over Nelson. Homer, however, feels betrayed by Bart's choice to drive Martin's racer instead of the one he helped Bart to make. When Bart tries to {{apologize}} to Homer, he selfishly denounces both Bart and Martin, telling Bart {{to do whatever he}} wants. Marge steps in and tells Homer that she has defended him through a lot of things over the years, but his latest actions prove that he is a bad father. As Bart gets ready to race in the final match with Martin's newly tuned racer, Homer thinks to himself about how selfish he has been, realizing that Bart needs his support regardless of whose racer he is using, and he rushes off to the race. At the starting line, Homer wishes Bart good luck and tells him that no matter how the race ends he will still be proud of him. The race is tough as Nelson pulls every dirty trick in his arsenal, but eventually through his skill Bart finishes first and the team enjoys their victory.|$|E

Thurgood Marshall also wrote separately, recounting at length the history of {{discrimination}} against African-Americans, and concluding, [...] "I do not believe that anyone can truly look into America's past and still find that a remedy for the effects of that past is impermissible." [...] Blackmun subscribed to the idea of color consciousness, declaring that, [...] "in order to get beyond racism, we must first take account of race.

500|$|After {{years of}} {{both public and}} {{political}} pressure, the provincial government announced in February2006 that it would begin twinning the entire two-lane portion of the highway from Atmore to {{the south end of}} Fort McMurray, the stretch they deemed to be the most dangerous. [...] Work began in 2006 and was estimated to take at least five years to complete. [...] The first section was completed in 2008 at a cost of $53million, stretching south from Airport Road (then Highway69) to a point south of the Highway881 intersection. [...] The Mariana Lakes Country Store near Mariana Lake was closed in September2008 {{to make way for the}} twinning. [...] It was the only service station between Wandering River and Fort McMurray, but Alberta Transportation had no other options due to the proximity of the lake and utilities. [...] The store's owner was reluctant to relinquish the property but acknowledged that upgrades to the dangerous highway were more important than the continued operation of the store. [...] "The twinning of the highway is far more important, and there really <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> for us to stay here," [...] she stated.

500|$|It was {{initially}} {{announced that the}} Republican Party {{would go to the}} parliamentary election alone and would seek [...] "qualitative majority" [...] in the parliament, and that their goal was the fairness of the electoral process. Surprisingly for many, on 30 March 1999, Vazgen Sargsyan and the runner-up of the 1998 presidential election and Armenia's ex-communist leader Karen Demirchyan issued a joint announcement that they were forming an alliance between the People's Party of Armenia and the Republican Party. It {{came to be known as}} the Unity bloc («Միասնություն» դաշինք), often referred to as Miasnutyun. Vazgen Sargsyan claimed the bloc was a [...] "genuine" [...] alliance and that the two parties had come together to lead Armenia [...] "from a turning point to progress." [...] When asked about the reasons why he joined Demirchyan, Sargsyan said that, [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> out." [...] According to the U.S. Helsinki Commission, Sargsyan [...] "obviously concluded it was better to have the popular Demirchyan as an ally than an opponent," [...] and that [...] "in forming Unity bloc, Sargsyan and Demirchyan overcame whatever ideological differences they may have had, and said they had joined forces to overcome the difficult problems facing Armenia while promoting tolerance in the country’'s political life." [...] In analyst Richard Giragosian's words, the bloc was [...] "an odd mix," [...] however he admitted that it [...] "effectively marginalized the electoral threat" [...] of other parties. Sociologist Levon Baghdasaryan described it as [...] "unification of the new and old nomenklaturas." [...] The British Helsinki Human Rights Group wrote of the Unity bloc that it [...] "aimed to appeal to the electorate by being all things to all men." [...] The ODIHR suggested that the [...] "alliance was not only created for electoral purposes, but that a strategic political agreement had been reached while overcoming ideological differences." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to Beauvoir, while a woman {{knows how}} to be as active, {{effective}} and silent as a man, her situation keeps her being useful, preparing food, clothes, and lodging. She worries because she does not do anything, she complains, she cries, and she may threaten suicide. She protests but doesn't escape her lot. She may achieve happiness in [...] "Harmony" [...] and the [...] "Good" [...] as illustrated by Virginia Woolf and Katherine Mansfield. Beauvoir thinks it is pointless to try to decide whether woman is superior or inferior, {{and that it is}} obvious that the man's situation is [...] "infinitely preferable". She writes, [...] "for woman there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> out than to work for her liberation".|$|E
2500|$|William F.

2500|$|This {{content of}} this {{information}} card was seen as vitally important and all soldiers were taught to be entirely familiar with it as it contained specific instructions to be followed when opening fire on a suspected enemy.

Soldiers could only shoot without warning [...] "if there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> to protect themselves or those whom it is their duty to protect from the danger of being killed or seriously injured." [...] The card was amended in 1980 to carry the words [...] "Firearms must only {{be used as a}} last resort". [...] The use of the card was debated in Parliament.|$|E

2500|$|This {{motion was}} amended and {{approved}} by resolution of the Dáil, after considerable debate. The Republican, or Anti-Treaty, members had refused to take their seats in the Parliament and {{the opposition to the}} measures was provided by the Labour Party, who likened the legislation to a military dictatorship. On 3 October, the Free State had offered an amnesty to any Anti-Treaty fighters who surrendered their arms and recognised the government. However, there was little response. W. T. Cosgrave, the head of the Provisional Government, told the Dáil in response, [...] "Although I have always objected to the death penalty, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> that I know of in which ordered conditions can be restored in this country, or any security obtained for our troops, or to give our troops any confidence in us as a government".|$|E
2500|$|According to Kerouac, On the Road [...] "was {{really a}} story about two Catholic buddies roaming the country in search of God. And we found him.

THERE <b>IS</b> <b>NO</b> <b>OTHER</b> <b>WAY</b> OUT FOR THE HOLY MAN: HE MUST SWEAT FOR GOD. And once he has found Him, the Godhood of God is forever Established and really must not be spoken about." [...] According to his [...] biographer, historian Douglas Brinkley, On the Road has been misinterpreted as a tale of companions out looking for kicks, {{but the most important}} thing to comprehend is that Kerouac was an American Catholic author – for example, virtually every page of his diary bore a sketch of a crucifix, a prayer, or an appeal to Christ to be forgiven.|$|E
2500|$|As {{head of the}} Free State {{government}} {{during the}} Civil War, he was ruthless in {{what he saw as}} defence of the state against his former republican comrades. Although he actually disagreed {{with the use of the}} death penalty in principle, in October 1922 he enacted a Public Safety Bill, which allowed for the execution of anyone who was captured bearing arms against the state or aiding armed attacks on state forces. He told the Dáil on 27 September 1922, [...] "although I have always objected to the death penalty, there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> that I know of in which ordered conditions can be restored in this country, or any security obtained for our troops, or to give our troops any confidence in us as a government".

2500|$|The {{essential}} partiality of {{our view}} of things, their being given only in a certain perspective and at a certain moment in time does not diminish their reality, but on the contrary establishes it, as there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> for things to be copresent with us and with other things than through such [...] "Abschattungen" [...] (sketches, faint outlines, adumbrations). The thing transcends our view, but is manifest precisely by presenting itself {{to a range of}} possible views. The object of perception is immanently tied to its background—to the nexus of meaningful relations among objects within the world. Because the object is inextricably within the world of meaningful relations, each object reflects the other (much in the style of Leibniz's monads). Through involvement in the world – being-in-the-world – the perceiver tacitly experiences [...] all [...] the perspectives upon that object coming from all the surrounding things of its environment, as well as the potential perspectives that that object has upon the beings around it.|$|E
2500|$|Mill {{argues that}} if people who are [...] "competently acquainted" [...] with two pleasures show a decided {{preference}} for one even if it be accompanied by more discontent and [...] "would not resign it for any quantity of the other", then it is legitimate to regard that pleasure as being superior in quality. Mill recognizes that these [...] "competent judges" [...] will not always agree, and states that, in cases of disagreement, {{the judgment of the}} majority is to be accepted as final. Mill also acknowledges that [...] "many who are capable of the higher pleasures, occasionally, under the influence of temptation, postpone them to the lower. But this is quite compatible with a full appreciation of the intrinsic superiority of the higher." [...] Mill says that this appeal to those who have experienced the relevant pleasures is no different from what must happen when assessing the quantity of pleasure, for there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> of measuring [...] "the acutest of two pains, or the intensest of two pleasurable sensations." [...] "It is indisputable that the being whose capacities of enjoyment are low, has the greatest chance of having them fully satisfied; and a highly-endowed being will always feel that any happiness which he can look for, as the world is constitute, is imperfect." ...|$|E

Knowing that there <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>other</b> <b>way</b> to bring him back to the living, Hook wants Emma to go on without him and decides that it's time to say goodbye and vows not to let her be his unfinished business. Emma agrees not to put her emotional armor back up once they are separated. When Emma returns, she's on to Hades' and the Blind Witch's scheme to leave the outsiders in the Underworld, and she and Regina use their magic to free everyone, while Henry leaves behind the [...] "Once Upon a Time" [...] storybook with the details on the “unfinished business” of all the remaining Underworld residents. Finally, Gold places Robin's heart into Pan's, only for Pan to discover that Gold tricked his father: Gold had returned Robin's heart to Robin earlier, while Pan was distracted. Instead, he had replaced the heart with a wineskin filled with water from the River of Lost Souls, which was enchanted with a glamour spell to resemble Robin's heart. Gold tells a stunned Pan that he did this to keep him from getting the happy ending that a villain like him never deserved, as Pan dissolves into the River of Lost Souls. Then, Gold uses Pandora's Box to contain Belle safely, before leaving through the portal. Afterwards, all people, except for David and Emma, enter the portal. A heartbroken Emma explains to David that she needs to protect her loved ones. David understands and then takes Emma through the portal, just as it closes.|$|E
