500|$|The {{navigation}} and bombing system (NBS) comprised an H2S Mk9 radar and a navigation bombing computer (NBC) Mk1. Other navigation aids included a Marconi radio compass (ADF), GEE Mk3, Green Satin Doppler radar {{to determine the}} groundspeed and drift angle, radio and radar altimeters, and an instrument landing system. TACAN replaced GEE in the B.1A and B.2 in 1964 [...] Decca Doppler 72 replaced Green Satin in the B.2 around 1969 [...] A continuous display of the aircraft's position was maintained by a <b>ground</b> <b>position</b> <b>indicator</b> (GPI).|$|E
50|$|The Green Satin was {{initially}} {{used with a}} simple display system with two large dials presenting true ground speed in knots on the left, and drift angle on the right. The output from this system was typically sent, along with the G4 compass' output, to the Mark 4 <b>Ground</b> <b>Position</b> <b>Indicator</b> (GPI). The GPI was a simple mechanical computer that integrated the inputs to produce an offset from a user-provided initial location (taken from Gee, for instance), and presented this as either latitude and longitude or grid reference numbers on two odometer-like displays.|$|E
50|$|The flying {{controls}} of the Sea Vixen were relatively complex, which controlled the fully powered tailplane, ailerons and rudder; these controls remained usable {{even in the}} absence of electrical power, such as in the event of a double engine failure. Actuation of the powered flight control surfaces was provided by a pair of independent hydraulic systems and typically featured variable gearing of control movements over differing speeds. An intricate three-section flap arrangement was employed, partially due to the nature of the wing's geometry. The navigation, flight instrumentation and communications equipment included <b>ground</b> and air <b>position</b> <b>indicators,</b> a reference gyro, an autopilot capable of maintaining altitude and speed as well as yaw and pitch damping, tactical air navigation system (TACAN), and ultra high frequency (UHF) radio system.|$|R
50|$|While in Nouméa, the S-31 {{became the}} first American {{submarine}} to be equipped with a plan <b>position</b> <b>indicator,</b> or PPI. Originally intended for Admiral Halsey's flagship, the USS South Dakota, crewmen from the S-31 appropriated the plan <b>position</b> <b>indicator</b> for their own use. The plan <b>position</b> <b>indicator</b> proved remarkably useful during her eighth war patrol.|$|R

30|$|Even though {{driving into}} sidings/the depot is a {{frequent}} task for drivers working shifts around rush hours, it {{does not account for}} a significant percentage of their shift. Hence, when the large percentage of all category A SPaDs and the low percentage of the shift spent in these locations are considered, this suggests that there are issues {{in the design of the}} locations and operational procedures. The signalling is the main difference at the depot and the sidings compared to the rest of the network with the majority of the signals being <b>ground</b> <b>position</b> lights. Even though the majority of the drivers disagree with added complexity of those locations and <b>ground</b> <b>position</b> lights, they gave this type of signals the lowest mark. Moreover, participants’ involvement in category A SPaDs does not influence the attitudes of the drivers towards the <b>ground</b> <b>position</b> lights (U =  28, p =  0.663). The respondents mention that the <b>ground</b> <b>position</b> lights are hard to see at times due to low brightness and a poor choice of location. It is possible that the drivers do not see any hazard in this type of signalling in the context of day-to-day driving. However, when compared with different types of signals, they perceive the <b>ground</b> <b>position</b> lights as the hardest to interact with. It is also possible that the <b>ground</b> <b>position</b> lights are the hardest to interact with in the beginning of a shift before driving in passenger service.|$|R

40|$|The system-integrated reactor {{currently}} under {{development at the}} Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute is being designed with a soluble boron free operation {{and the use of}} a nuclear heating for the reactor start-up. These design features require a Control Element Drive Mechanism (CEDM) for the integral reactor to have a fine-step movement capability as well as a high reliability for a fine reactivity control. Also the reliability and accuracy of the information for the control rod position is very important to the reactor safety as well as the design of the core protection system. The <b>position</b> <b>indicator</b> is classified as a Class 1 E component because the rod position signal of the <b>position</b> <b>indicator</b> is used in the safety related systems. Therefore it will be separated from the control systems to the extent that a failure of any single control system component of a channel and will have sufficient independence, redundancy, and testability to perform its safety functions assuming a single failure. The <b>position</b> <b>indicator</b> is composed of a permanent magnet, reed switches and a voltage divider. Four independent <b>position</b> <b>indicators</b> around the upper pressure housing provide an indication of the position of a control rod comprising of a permanent magnet with a magnetic field concentrator which moves with the extension shaft connected to the control rod.
