5|$|These {{issues were}} would shape {{what would be}} known as Operation Claret. The best-trained British light {{infantry}} roamed the jungle, attacking Indonesian bases and patrols at will and trying to {{give the appearance of}} being everywhere at once as a psychological effect upon the enemy. Initially launched only over short distances, seaborne raids into peninsular Malaysia caused the range to be extended throughout 1964 and 1965. Walker continued the Claret raids to great effect until the end of his tenure, as he was replaced by Major General George Lea as commander of British forces in Borneo. Lea, however, had the bad fortune of being ordered to take command just as the conflict began to reach its climax in the spring of 1965. Sukarno, <b>desperate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> decisive victory and apprehensive of the effect that the fruitless conflict was having upon his country, was beginning to order stronger attacks to win a decisive military victory and drive the British from the border lines.|$|E

50|$|Given {{his late}} season performance, Descalso started the 2011 Spring {{training}} with a legitimate {{chance to make}} the Cardinals.

The difficulty would be determining a position and securing a spot. An injury to Punto and questions about Freese's durability left the Cards <b>desperate</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> extra utility infielder (rather than an outfielder). Ultimately, Descalso secured a roster spot out of training camp.|$|R

25|$|In {{the early}} 1880s Lyttelton played four Test matches against Australia, {{the most notable}} of which was that contested at The Oval in 1884. In {{the course of this}} game, Australia reached a total – all but unheard-of at the time – of 500 for six and the England captain, Lord Harris, grew so <b>desperate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{breakthrough}} that he asked his wicket-keeper, Lyttelton, to bowl. W. G. Grace kept wicket while Lyttelton sent down a succession of underarm lobs, succeeding, remarkably, in taking the last four Australian wickets for only 19 runs {{in the course of a}} dozen four ball overs.

25|$|<b>Desperate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> new {{high-tech}} combat aircraft, between late 1990 and 1993 the PAF {{evaluated the}} European Panavia Tornado MRCA (multi-role combat aircraft) and rejected it.

In 1992 the PAF again looked at the Mirage 2000, reviving a proposal from the early 1980s to procure around 20–40 aircraft, but again a sale did not occur because France {{did not want to}} sell a fully capable version due to political reasons. In August 1994 the PAF was offered the Saab JAS-39 Gripen by Sweden, but again the sale did not occur because 20% of the Gripen's components were from the U.S. and Pakistan was still under U.S. sanctions.|$|E

25|$|Chris Harte has {{thoroughly}} {{researched the}} files of the SACA, and written histories of both the SACA and Australian cricket. His {{analysis of the situation}} is that an (unspecified) prior commercial agreement forced Bradman to remain in Australia. Moreover, Harte attributes an ulterior motive to the SACA's recruitment of Bradman. The issue of the off-field behaviour of Vic Richardson, and some other regular SA players, had festered {{over a number of years}} and the SACA was <b>desperate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> solution. Therefore, they wanted Bradman to provide new leadership and improve discipline, as well as score runs. Bradman became a committeeman of the SACA, and a selector of the SA and Australian teams. He took his adopted state to the Sheffield Shield for the first time in ten years and set a string of SA records along the way.|$|E
25|$|After getting only 2 {{points on}} draws {{in the first}} two games of the four-game homestand, United was <b>desperate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> win when Portland Timbers came to town. The start of the game was delayed an hour because of record-setting heat that {{exceeded}} 100 degrees (on the Fahrenheit scale), but United got off to a hot start themselves. An early corner was headed on by Boswell to Birnbaum, who took his chance on a sharp volley to give D.C. an early lead. The team doubled that lead in the 29th minute, just before a scheduled heat break, when Acosta finished a chance in front of goal, set up by a nifty chipped pass from Mullins. Thanks to the usual heroics by Hamid, the team held on for a 2-0 shutout win that lifted United ahead of New England and at least temporarily holding the sixth and final postseason spot in the East.|$|E
25|$|The second play, FlatSpin, is {{a comedy}} thriller. Rosie Seymour is an out-of-work actress openly <b>desperate</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> {{job and a}} man.

Rosie, going along with this assumed identity, allows Sam back to the flat that evening to cook her dinner. The date is going extraordinarily well until Sam is suddenly called away, only for a couple of heavies to return with Sam later. It turns out that Sam, the heavies and the flat are all part of an elaborate drugs sting due to take place that evening.

50|$|Set in New South Wales, Australia, it's Boxing Day 1945 in Turnaround Creek, an outback town. The dust settles as {{the town}} nurses their Christmas hangover. Harold Slocum and his family of the Slocum's Travelling Tent Show are down on their luck and become stranded. They're broke and <b>desperate</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> audience; they end up in Turnaround Creek. To the country folk, the {{prospect}} of a show is a welcome diversion, but Barry the publican at the Shamrock is strangely unwelcoming. He remembers the last time the Slocums were in the district. Emotions run high and the sedentary life of the town is disturbed by the remembrance of an illicit affair. The musical represses new life breathed into the rural community, and is altogether humorous and sensitive.|$|R

On March 25, after being briefed by officials at the State Department, the Pentagon and the CIA, the Wise Men meet once more with the president. This time they advised against any further troop increases and recommended that the administration seek a negotiated peace. While initially incensed by their conclusions, Johnson quickly came to accept that their assessment of the situation was accurate.|$|R
