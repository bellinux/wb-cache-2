5|$|Afrasia {{has only}} {{been found in the}} Eocene Pondaung Formation of central Myanmar, a rock unit which has been dated to about 37 million years ago using magnetostratigraphy and fission track dating. This places it {{at the end of the}} Bartonian stage, near the Middle–Late Eocene boundary. Although many tons of sediments in the area have been {{screened}} for fossils, Afrasia is still known only from four teeth, suggesting that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> species.|$|E
5|$|The {{roughness}} of {{this version}} succeeded {{in a way}} the recorded version on 'Emotions' could never manage. In the sterile atmosphere of a studio, where perfection, technology, and overdubbing were the rules, spontaneity had no place. On the stage, it was valued, and this performance had it. Everyone pushed everyone just a little further, to create something wonderful, and judging by the response, the audience realized it, as did Mariah when the song was finished. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> moment, one that true performers strive for and don't find often enough to satisfy themselves.|$|E
5|$|General von Toll {{initially}} {{planned to}} order his infantry {{to start the}} assault at 16:00, but Paskevich through his aides ordered him to postpone the attack until 16:45. Eventually around 5:00 von Kreutz's corps advanced towards Forts 21 and 22 in two columns. Russian horse artillery reached a position 200 paces from Fort 22 and started shelling the defenders at close range. Already shaken by the fire of the Grand Battery, the Poles abandoned the fort and retreated before the surprised Russian infantry approached. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> example of artillery capturing a fortified position {{without the help of}} other forces. Meanwhile, the fighting for the nearby Fort 22 was heavy. In the end its garrison fell almost to the last man.|$|E

5|$|Parasaurolophus walkeri, {{from the}} Dinosaur Park Formation, {{was a member}} of a diverse and {{well-documented}} fauna of prehistoric animals, including well-known dinosaurs such as the horned Centrosaurus, Chasmosaurus, and Styracosaurus; fellow duckbills Gryposaurus and Corythosaurus; tyrannosaurid Gorgosaurus; and armored Edmontonia, Euoplocephalus and Dyoplosaurus. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> constituent of this fauna. The Dinosaur Park Formation is interpreted as a low-relief setting of rivers and floodplains that became more swampy and influenced by marine conditions over time as the Western Interior Seaway transgressed westward. The climate was warmer than present-day Alberta, without frost, but with wetter and drier seasons. Conifers were apparently the dominant canopy plants, with an understory of ferns, tree ferns, and angiosperms.|$|E
5|$|The {{funeral service}} for Pat Nixon {{took place in}} the grounds of the Richard Nixon Library in Yorba Linda on June 26, 1993. Speakers at the ceremony, {{including}} California Governor Pete Wilson, Kansas senator Bob Dole, and the Reverend Dr. Billy Graham, eulogized the former First Lady. In addition to her husband and immediate family, former presidents Ronald Reagan and Gerald Ford and their wives, Nancy and Betty, were also in attendance. Lady Bird Johnson was unable to attend because she was in the hospital recovering from a stroke, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis did not attend either. President Nixon sobbed openly, profusely, and at times uncontrollably during the ceremony. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> display of emotion from the former president, and Helen McCain Smith said that she had never seen him more distraught.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} Arlene {{were from a}} cloud mass that {{developed}} in the eastern Pacific Ocean in early May1981. The system crossed Central America, and by the afternoon of May5, a low-level circulation was evident near Roatán, {{off the coast of}} Honduras. Convection was initially disorganized, preventing classification as a tropical cyclone. It was not until late on May6 that Dvorak satellite intensity estimates began on the system. Around that time, it is estimated it became a tropical depression, while located near the Cayman Island. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> example of an Atlantic depression forming from a disturbance that originated in the eastern Pacific.|$|E

5|$|Tropical Storm Alice was {{the first}} {{tropical}} cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean to receive a female name. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> off-season tropical cyclone that hit Central America, Cuba, and Florida in late May to early June 1953. Alice formed on May 25 in the western Caribbean, and executed a large loop over Central America. It passed over western Cuba, causing heavy rainfall and possibly several casualties from drowning. It then executed another loop in the Gulf of Mexico, reached a peak intensity of 70mph (110km/h), and weakened before hitting the Florida panhandle on June 6. Although heavy rainfall occurred in Florida, there was little damage.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} after {{assuming}} command, on 15 October 1917, Stuart was on hand to rescue the United States Navy destroyer USS Cassin after she was torpedoed by U-61 in heavy weather. Along with one crewmember killed and nine wounded, the Cassin had lost her entire stern including the rudder and {{was in danger of}} sinking. The dead crew member was Osmond Ingram, who had died throwing burning munitions overboard and was later posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor. Twenty miles from the Irish coast and in total darkness, the Tamarisk not only found the crippled ship but was able to come alongside in high seas and a strong gale and pass across a tow line. Twice during the night the tow broke and twice it was reconnected as the battle to save the ship continued. The next morning several trawlers came to the aid of the Q-ship and together they enabled the Cassin to make port, saving the ship and her crew. Ten years after the Cassin's rescue the US Navy awarded Stuart the Navy Cross in recognition of his part in the operation; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> presentation to a sailor of a foreign navy and the only occasion in which the recipient also possessed the Victoria Cross.|$|E
5|$|As the {{defending}} champions, Santos qualified automatically to the semi-final {{stage of the}} 1963 Copa Libertadores. The ballet blanco, the nickname given to Santos for Pelé, managed to retain the title after victories over Botafogo and Boca Juniors. Pelé helped Santos overcome a Botafogo team that contained Brazilian legends such as Garrincha and Jairzinho with a last-minute goal in {{the first leg of}} the semi-finals which made it 1–1. In the second leg, Pelé scored a hat-trick in the Estádio do Maracanã as Santos won, 0–4, in the second leg. Santos started the final series by winning, 3–2, in the first leg and defeating Boca Juniors 1–2, in La Bombonera. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> feat in official competitions, with another goal from Pelé. Santos became the first (and to date the only) Brazilian team to lift the Copa Libertadores in Argentine soil. Pelé finished the tournament with 5 goals. Santos lost the Campeonato Paulista after finishing in third place but {{went on to win the}} Rio-São Paulo tournament after a 0–3 win over Flamengo in the final, with Pelé scoring one goal. Pelé would also help Santos retain the Intercontinental Cup and the Taça Brasil against Milan and Bahia respectively.|$|E

25|$|When the prison's doctor {{inspected}} the prisoners, {{he was surprised}} to find Latreille scrutinising a beetle on the dungeon floor. When Latreille explained that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> insect, the physician was impressed, and sent the insect to a 15-year-old local naturalist, Jean Baptiste Bory de Saint-Vincent. Bory de St.-Vincent knew Latreille's work, and managed to obtain the release of Latreille and one of his cell-mates. All the other inmates were dead within one month. The beetle had been described by Johan Christian Fabricius in 1775, but recognising it had saved Latreille's life.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} {{documented}} incidents show {{the extent of}} the famine. Edward II, King of England, stopped at St Albans on 10 August 1315 and had difficulty finding bread for himself and his entourage; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> occasion in which the King of England was unable to eat. The French, under Louis X, tried to invade Flanders, but being in the low country of the Netherlands, the fields were soaked and the army became so bogged down they were forced to retreat, burning their provisions where they left them, unable to carry them away.|$|E

25|$|In Venice, {{the second}} and current St. Mark's Basilica {{was built on the}} site of the first between 1063 and 1072, {{replacing}} the earlier church while replicating its Greek cross plan. Five domes vault the interior (one each over the four arms of the cross and one in the center). These domes were built in the Byzantine style, in imitation of the now lost Church of the Holy Apostles in Constantinople. Mounted over pendentives, each dome has a ring of windows at its base. These five windowed domes reflect the addition of windows (within tall drums) in the remodeled Byzantine original. However, the tall outer shells at St. Mark's were not added until after 1204. The later high wooden outer domes with lead roofing and cupolas were added to St. Mark's Basilica between 1210 and 1270, allowing the church to be seen from a great distance. In addition to allowing for a more imposing exterior, building two distinct shells in a dome improved weather protection. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> practice before the 11th century. The fluted and onion-shaped cupolas of the domes may have been added in the mid-fifteenth century to complement the ogee arches added to the facade in the late Gothic period. Their shape may have been influenced by the open and domed wooden pavilions of Persia or by other eastern models. Initially, only the center dome had one.|$|E
500|$|Academy Award-nominated screenwriter Hossein Amini {{adapted the}} novel for the screen. He felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> book to receive from a studio {{because it was}} short, gloomy, and like a poem. Since the novel does not present a linear story, but has many flashbacks and jumps around in time, Amini found the {{adaptation}} challenging. He felt the non-linear structure made it [...] "a very tricky structure" [...] for a feature film.|$|E
500|$|The {{stained glass}} window became a tourist {{attraction}} and the last memorial to Stowe in Florida; in later decades some of the parishioners and clergy had doubts about its [...] "churchliness" [...] as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> depiction in an Anglican church not referencing a Biblical theme. In 1964 Hurricane Dora destroyed the Church of Our Saviour, including the stained glass window. Across the street, is the Mandarin Community Club, the former school sponsored by Stowe; the structure was given to Mandarin in 1936. It is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Mandarin has since grown into a suburb of the expansive city of Jacksonville.|$|E

500|$|Until the Enlightenment era, {{the crucifixion}} {{darkness}} story was often used by Christian apologists {{because they believed}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> example of the biblical account being supported by non-Christian sources. When the pagan critic Celsus claimed that Jesus could hardly be a God because he had performed no great deeds, [...] the third-century Christian commentator Origen responded, in Against Celsus, by recounting the darkness, earthquake and opening of tombs. As proof that the incident had happened, he referred to a description by Phlegon of Tralles of an eclipse, accompanied by earthquakes felt {{in other parts of}} the Empire during the reign of Tiberius (probably that of 29 CE).|$|E
500|$|Following his death, Melvin was memorialized by the West Virginia Bar Association at {{its annual}} meeting in December 1906. The {{association}} averred, [...] "Judge Melvin's name and character, both as a Judge and as a man, was not only well known and recognized in the Circuit in which he so long occupied the Bench, but known and honored throughout {{the entire state of}} West Virginia." [...] In his Bench and Bar of West Virginia (1919), former Governor George W. Atkinson remarked of Melvin's judicial career: [...] "He sought only to be just and fair, and rarely if ever, failed in deciding right. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> occurrence for one of his decisions to be reversed by the Appellate Court. Furthermore {{he was one of the}} most courteous, urbane of men, and was at all times absolutely honest and sincere." ...|$|E
500|$|Norman Wilner of MSN {{considered}} Licence to Kill {{the second}} worst Bond film, above only A View to a Kill, but defended Dalton, saying he [...] "got a raw deal.

In October 2008 Time Out re-issued a review of Licence to Kill and also thought that Dalton was unfortunate, saying [...] "one has to feel for Dalton, who was never given a fair shake by either of the films in which he appeared". On a more positive note, Chuck O'Leary of Fantastica Daily remarked that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>rare</b> entry in the Bond series where the danger seems real.|$|E
