50|$|A four-seat prototype, the Tsikada-3M, preceded a four-seat, four-door, four-window {{production}} version {{known as}} the Tskiada-4 or Sky Wind-AT, which is 400 mm longer than before. The earlier flaperons were replaced with separate <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons.</b> The prototype finished flight trials in July 2009 and the Tsikada-4 was first flown in August, followed by production the following year.|$|R
50|$|The {{prototype}} AM-69 was an all-wood, {{low wing}} cantilever monoplane. Its wings, skinned with birch plywood had a modified Mureau 234 section {{with a maximum}} thickness-to-chord ratio of 13.2%, notable for the large area of both upper and lower surfaces which were flat. There was dihedral over the whole wing and a full-span combination of inboard <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{center wing}} box, outer wing box, wing panels, <b>flaps,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons</b> are {{planned to be}} built in Xi'an, China; the center {{fuselage}} sections are planned {{to be built in}} Hongdu, China. Aluminium-lithium alloys account for 8.8% of the structure and composite materials for 12%. The air frame will be made largely of aluminum alloy. Aircraft design and assembly is performed in Shanghai.|$|R
50|$|The {{models have}} evolved into {{predominantly}} all composite gliders of 3.4-4 m wingspan with full span <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons,</b> sufficiently strong {{to take a}} two-man tow in a wind of up to 20 mph. Advances in composite construction have reduced the flying weights of these models to less than 2 kg. Ballast weight is added to increase the flying speed during windy weather.|$|R
25|$|The F/A-18 is a twin engine, mid wing, {{multi-mission}} tactical aircraft. It {{is highly}} maneuverable, owing to its good thrust to weight ratio, digital fly-by-wire control system, and leading-edge extensions (LEX). The LEX allow the Hornet to remain controllable at high angles of attack. The trapezoidal wing has a 20-degree sweepback {{on the leading}} edge and a straight trailing edge. The wing has full-span leading-edge <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> the trailing edge has single-slotted <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons</b> over the entire span.|$|R
2500|$|The Ju 49 {{was built}} in typical Junkers fashion as a cantilever-wing {{monoplane}} of all-metal construction with stressed duralumin skin throughout, corrugated on the flying surfaces. The wing trailing edge featured the standard Junkers [...] "double wing", combining adjustable <b>flap</b> <b>and</b> <b>aileron</b> surfaces outboard, together with plain flaps inboard. The aircraft had a fixed, split-axle main undercarriage which was noticeably tall, to accommodate the large-diameter propeller, plus a tailskid.|$|R
5000|$|The Cessna 182 is an {{all-metal}} (mostly aluminum alloy) aircraft, {{although some}} parts [...] - [...] such as engine cowling nosebowl and wingtips [...] - [...] {{are made of}} fiberglass or thermoplastic material. Its wing has the same planform as the smaller Cessna 172 and the larger 205/206 series; however, some wing details such as <b>flap</b> <b>and</b> <b>aileron</b> design {{are the same as}} the 172 and are not like the 205/206 components.|$|R
40|$|Numerical {{results for}} the X- 38 vehicle, shape 3. 1 and 8. 3 are {{presented}} and discussed. For shape 3. 1 the present report {{is a continuation of}} previous numerical studies carried out at DLR and therefore dedicated to explain and/or clarify specific problems found during those investigations. <b>Flap</b> <b>and</b> <b>aileron</b> efficiency are analyzed with respect to the geometry adopted for the flap, at several Mach numbers and under flight as well as wind tunnel flow conditions. For shape 8. 3 the goal of the present study is to demonstrate the ability of CFD to rebuild the experimental investigation carried out for this shape in the S- 3 Modane wind tunnel. Aerodynamic coefficients, <b>flap</b> <b>and</b> <b>aileron</b> efficiencies as well as a flow documentation are presented for M= 6 and alpha= 40 °. The results of the present investigation could not explain the differences found between data obtained from CFD and data obtained for the shape 3. 1 in the Langley wind tunnel. However, a good agreement between the numerical results and the aerodynamic data base (ADB) is found for both, <b>flap</b> <b>and</b> <b>aileron</b> efficiency, at the investigated flow conditions even though ADB was defined for flight Reynolds number with turbulent boundary layer. Also, the CFD results for shape 8. 3 are in good agreement with the data obtained for this shape in the Modane wind tunnel. The present investigation clearly demonstrates that for viscous dominated problems a good experimental/numerical correlation is achieved when not only the same physics but also the same degree of geometrical representation of the configuration is employed for both simulations. In most cases the numerical experimental discrepancies arising by the geometrical simplifications of the CFD configurations are larger than the discrepancies found due to CFD numerical accuracy and/or lack of physical modeling...|$|R
50|$|A variant with {{separate}} <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons</b> <b>and</b> a slightly taller tail, the LS3a, {{was introduced in}} 1978. This version did away with the flaperon mass balancing, making each wing about 10 kg lighter. A span extension to 17 metres was later developed for this version. Although not very successful due to speed and ballasting limitations, these extensions pioneered a trend that has become extremely popular. Today most new standard and 15-meter class gliders offer tip extensions as an option.|$|R
25|$|The {{final design}} looked much like Noorduyn's earlier Fokker designs, a high-wing braced {{monoplane}} with an all-welded steel tubing fuselage. Attached wood stringers carried a fabric skin. Its wing was all fabric covered wood, except for steel tubing <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons.</b> The divided landing gear were fitted to fuselage stubs; legs were secured with two bolts each {{to allow the}} alternate arrangement of floats or skis. The tail wheel strut could be fitted with a wheel or tail skid.|$|R
50|$|The Revathi was a conventional, low-wing {{monoplane}} with fixed tailwheel undercarriage and {{two seats}} side-by-side with an optional third seat behind them. The fuselage construction was of welded steel tube, with the forward section skinned in aluminium and the tail section in fabric. The wings were of all-metal construction and originally fitted with wooden <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons</b> that were later replaced with metal surfaces. The tail surfaces were also originally wooden but later replaced with metal.|$|R
50|$|The {{final design}} looked much like Noorduyn's earlier Fokker designs, a high-wing braced {{monoplane}} with an all-welded steel tubing fuselage. Attached wood stringers carried a fabric skin.

The tail wheel strut could be fitted with a wheel or tail skid.|$|R
50|$|The control {{surfaces}} incorporate flaperons which serve as both <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons.</b> The wing has a newly designed thinner airfoil and higher aspect ratio than previous types of DG gliders. This gives a higher performance {{but at a}} cost of worse slow-speed characteristics, making it less suitable for gliding competitions with frequent gaggles in thermals. The same problem is also noticeable on LS-7 and ASW-24 gliders, where improved performance was to be achieved with thinner airfoils.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} was fitted with various devices to increase lift; slotted <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> slotted <b>ailerons</b> <b>and,</b> {{on the low}} wing sponsons, split flaps. The wings folded back, pivoted close to the fuselage, on hydraulic power.|$|R
500|$|The {{flight control}} {{surfaces}} were controlled by a central management computer system. Raising the wing <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons</b> {{on one side and}} lowering them on the other provided roll. The V-tail fins were angled 50 degrees from the vertical. Pitch was mainly provided by rotating these V-tail fins in opposite directions so their front edges moved together or apart. Yaw was primarily supplied by rotating the tail fins in the same direction. [...] Test pilot Paul Metz stated that the YF-23 had superior high angle of attack (AoA) performance compared to legacy aircraft. Deflecting the wing <b>flaps</b> down <b>and</b> <b>ailerons</b> up on both sides simultaneously provided for aerodynamic braking. [...] To keep costs low despite the novel design, a number of [...] "commercial off-the-shelf" [...] components were used, including an F-15 nose wheel, F/A-18 main landing gear parts, and the forward cockpit components of the F-15E Strike Eagle.|$|R
50|$|After its 1935 {{accident}} and rebuild, the Windspiel {{was a little}} heavier, but the only major alteration was {{the separation of the}} full-span flaperons into inboard <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> outboard <b>ailerons.</b>|$|R
40|$|The goal of {{this project}} was to design, in detail, the wing, <b>flaps,</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons</b> for a primary flight trainer. Integrated in this design are {{provisions}} for the fuel system, the electrical system, and the fuselage/cabin carry-through interface structure. This conceptual design displays the general arrangement of all major components in the wing structure, taking into consideration the requirements set forth by the appropriate sections of Federal Aviation Regulation Part 23 (FAR 23) {{as well as those}} established in the statement of work...|$|R
50|$|The 55° {{swept wing}} {{had a slight}} {{negative}} camber, and was fitted {{with a pair of}} aerodynamic fences to prevent the spanwise flow of air away from the wing roots. The leading edge of the wing incorporated a pair of PVD leading edge slats. <b>Flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons</b> were mounted on the trailing edge of the wing. The outer flaps were aligned with the trailing edge forward sweep <b>and</b> the inner <b>flaps</b> were perpendicular to the longitudinal axis of the body.|$|R
50|$|The GW-3 and 4 both use a 54 ft wing, with a NACA 43012A airfoil. The {{aircraft}} are all-metal, with {{the portion of}} the wing aft of the spar covered in doped aircraft fabric. The <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons</b> are sheet metal covered. The wing design is unusual as it uses a single spar and transmits its torsion and drag loads via a thick leading edge skin. This resulted in wings that weigh 100 lb each. The prototype GW-3 weighed 380 lb empty in total.|$|R
50|$|The {{rules of}} the Standard Class were changed again to allow the <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons</b> to move {{together}} (flaperons) and for intermediate settings of the flaps between landing mode and zero. The result was the PIK-20B which won British, American and Finnish National Championships in 1975. In 1976 Ingo Renner won the World Championship with a PIK-20B and second and third places were also taken by this type. Most owners of PIK-20A converted to the B's flaperon arrangements. Carbon fiber spars later became standard.|$|R
50|$|The digital FBW {{system of}} the {{aircraft}} employs an advance next-generation distributed digital flight control computer (DDFCC) made by ADE comprising four computing channels, {{each with its own}} independent power supply and all housed in differently placed LRU. The DFCC receives signals from a variety of sensors and pilot control stick inputs, and processes these through the appropriate channels to excite and control the elevons, rudder and leading edge slat hydraulic actuators. DFCC provides raising the wing <b>flaps</b> <b>and</b> <b>ailerons</b> on one side and lowering them on the other provided roll. The Pelikan-tail fins are angled at 27 degrees from the vertical. Pitch is mainly provided by rotating these pelikan-tail fins in opposite directions so their front edges moved together or apart. Yaw is primarily supplied by rotating the tail fins in the same direction. The AMCA is designed for superior high Angle of attack (AoA) performance. Deflecting the wing <b>flaps</b> down <b>and</b> <b>ailerons</b> up on both sides simultaneously provided for Aerodynamic braking.|$|R
