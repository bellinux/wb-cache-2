50|$|Experiments {{have been}} done about the {{stability}} of ferric ferrocyanide in the soil around manufactured gas plant sites. Ferric ferrocyanide is, on its own, of fairly low toxicity. In fact, {{there is evidence that}} being complexed with iron retards the mobility of the cyanide ion, which is the problematic species of this compound. This means that the mobility of cyanide is entirely dependent on the stability of iron-cyanide complexes. Below pH 4 and above pH 6, ferric ferrocyanide begins to dissociate in water under this reaction:Fe4Fe(CN)63(s) + 12 H2O ↔ 4Fe(OH)3(s) + 3Fe(CN)6−3(aq) + 3e− + 12H+ This dissolved ferrocyanide can then go through a first-order photochemical dissociation pathway if exposed to sunlight, dissociating to iron ions and ferrocyanide between the rates of 2.2% per hour to 40% per hour depending on the flow of the body of water.

50|$|Methemoglobinaemia {{is a form}} of {{abnormal}} hemoglobin where the iron centre has been oxidised from the +2 oxidation state (the normal form) to the +3 state. This causes a leftward shift in the oxygen hemoglobin dissociation curve, as any residual heme with oxygenated ferrous iron (+2 state) is unable to unload its bound oxygen into tissues (because 3+ iron impairs hemoglobin's cooperativity), thereby increasing its affinity with oxygen. However, methemoglobin has increased rbc affinity for cyanide, and is therefore useful in the treatment of cyanide poisoning. In cases of accidental ingestion, administration of a nitrite (such as amyl nitrite) can be used to deliberately oxidise hemoglobin and raise methemoglobin levels, restoring the functioning of cytochrome oxidase. The nitrite also acts as a vasodilator, promoting the cellular supply of oxygen, and the addition of an iron salt provides for competitive binding of the <b>free</b> <b>cyanide</b> as the biochemically inert hexacyanoferrate(III) ion, Fe(CN)63&minus;.
