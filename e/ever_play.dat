5|$|Chicago and Indianapolis {{are the two}} closest cities, geographically, to <b>ever</b> <b>play</b> in a Super Bowl; at 182 miles (293km) apart (connected by a {{route that}} is mostly Interstate 65), they are {{slightly}} closer than New York and Baltimore, whose teams played each other at III (207 miles) and XXXV (188 miles). This prompted Colts coach Tony Dungy to joke to Jim Nantz, {{at the end of}} the AFC Championship game, that the two teams should split the difference and play the game in Fort Wayne.|$|E

Strauss Jr. was able to persuade the Dommayer's Casino in Hietzing, a suburb of Vienna, to allow him to perform. The elder Strauss, in anger at his son's disobedience, and at that of the proprietor, refused to <b>ever</b> <b>play</b> at the Dommayer's Casino again, which had been the site of many of his earlier triumphs.|$|E

5|$|After {{returning}} to the United States, Owumi was diagnosed with posttraumatic stress disorder, and he would suffer from its effects {{in the years that}} followed. He sometimes has had anxiety attacks before games, struggled to sleep, and considered suicide. Owumi received an offer to play another season with El-Olympi. The contract, two times that from his first year in Egypt, would have been the biggest contract of his career and would have made him the best-paid player to <b>ever</b> <b>play</b> in the Middle East. Initially accepting the deal, he later decided against it because he wanted to take a break from his basketball career. Instead, he began working at a community center in his hometown in Atlanta for seven months, making $9.25 per hour.|$|E
5|$|Greene is {{recognized}} as one of the most dominant players to <b>ever</b> <b>play</b> in the NFL. He is widely considered one of the greatest defensive linemen in league history.

5|$|However, Mikan met 28-year-old rookie DePaul {{basketball}} coach Ray Meyer, who saw {{potential in the}} bright and intelligent, but also clumsy and shy, freshman. Put into perspective, Meyer's thoughts were revolutionary, {{because at the time}} it was believed that tall players were too awkward to <b>ever</b> <b>play</b> basketball well. In the following months, Meyer transformed Mikan into a confident, aggressive player who took pride in his height rather than being ashamed of it. Meyer and Mikan worked out intensively, and Mikan learned how to make hook shots accurately with either hand. This routine would become later known as the Mikan Drill. In addition, Meyer made Mikan punch a speed bag, take dancing lessons, and jump rope to make him a complete athlete.|$|E

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{defining}} actions of Sakic's career was {{at the conclusion of}} the 2001 playoffs. Defying the NHL tradition of the captain being the first to skate around with the Stanley Cup, Sakic passed it off to teammate Ray Bourque. Bourque, one of the best defensemen to <b>ever</b> <b>play,</b> had been traded to the Avalanche the year before after spending 21 years with the Boston Bruins and setting the record for most games played without winning the Cup. Sakic's handing of the Stanley Cup exemplifies his classiness and how he performs through actions rather than words.|$|E

Of course, I don't know that any of these men will apply for reinstatement, but if they do, the above are at least a few of the rules that will be enforced. Just keep in mind that, regardless {{of the verdict}} of juries, baseball is competent to protect itself against crooks, {{both inside and outside the}} game.|$|E

5|$|Garfield Sobers, {{from the}} Caribbean island of Barbados, was widely {{regarded}} as one of the world's finest cricketers from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, and is placed by many among the best to <b>ever</b> <b>play</b> the sport. An all-rounder, he made his debut for the West Indies cricket team, the multinational side representing the Caribbean in international cricket, at the age of 17 in 1954. He was a regular member of the team for the next two decades. Sobers set a then-world record highest individual score of 365 runs not out during a Test match against Pakistan in 1958, and became captain of the West Indies team six years later. In domestic first-class cricket, he was one of the first West Indians to play abroad, representing South Australia and Nottinghamshire during the 1960s and 1970s. His batting, bowling and fielding were all regarded as excellent by contemporaries, but his decision making and tactics were occasionally criticised.|$|E
5|$|In late December, Bonneau {{signed for}} UMF Njarðvík of the Icelandic Úrvalsdeild. He scored a regular season-high 45 points, {{to help his}} team win Stjarnan 92–86. On 17 April 2015, he scored 52 points against KR for the fifth game of the Playoffs semi-final series. Following that performance, {{opponent}} head coach, Finnur Freyr Stefánsson, acknowledged Bonneau {{as one of the}} best players to <b>ever</b> <b>play</b> in the league. Bonneau led the Úrvalsdeild in scoring, averaging 36.9 points per game, also averaging 7.0 rebounds, 5.1 assists and 2.5 steals per game, in 11 games.

Gunnar Örlygsson, the team's chairman, compared Bonneau with Lionel Messi in terms of impact on the club. During a pre-season training in September he suffered an achilles tendon rupture. Bonneau stayed in Iceland for rehabilitation, with an intent to join the team in the play-offs. In his first game back from the injury, Bonneau again thore his achilles tendon, this time on his right foot. In October 2016, Bonneau signed a two-month contract with Njarðvík. At the end of the contract Njarðvík decided not renew it, citing their desire to acquire a bigger player.|$|E
