500|$|In a December 18, 2000 {{article for}} People {{magazine}} entitled [...] "Bad to Worse", Downey's stepmother Rosemary told author Alex Tresnlowski that Downey {{had been diagnosed}} with bipolar disorder [...] "a few years ago" [...] and added that his bipolar disorder was [...] "the reason he has a hard time staying sober. What hasn't been tried is medication and intensive psychotherapy." [...] In the same article, Dr. Manijeh Nikakhtar, a Los Angeles psychiatrist and co-author of Addiction or Self-Medication: The Truth (...) , says she received a letter from Downey in 1999, during his time at Corcoran II, asking for advice on his condition. She discovered that [...] "no one had done a complete [...] evaluation ...I asked him flat out if he thought he was bipolar, and he said, 'Oh yeah. There are times <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> lot of money and I'm hyperactive, and there are other times I'm down.'" [...] In an article for the March 2007 issue of Esquire, Downey told author Scott Raab that he wanted to address [...] "this whole thing about the bipolar" [...] after receiving a phone call from [...] "the Bipolar Association" [...] asking him about being bipolar. When Downey denied he had ever said he was bipolar, the caller quoted the People article, to which Downey replied, [...] "'No! Dr. Malibusian said ...', and they go, 'Well, it's been written, so we're going to quote it.'" [...] Downey flatly denied being [...] "depressed or manic" [...] and that previous attempts to diagnose him with any kind of psychiatric or mood disorder have always been skewed because [...] "the guy I was seeing didn't know I was smokin' crack in his bathroom. You can't make a diagnosis until somebody's sober." ...|$|E
2500|$|Said Johnson in 1988, [...] "For voluntarism to {{take hold}} {{as part of a}} company's culture, there must be a key {{executive}} who sets the example by personal involvement.... <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> good twenty to thirty percent of my time, or about two days of every seven, on what I call ‘not-for-profit’ activities.... Raising money is only one part of voluntarism; indeed it is not the most important. A more important part is the devotion of time by the people who actually service the organizations and spend a good portion of their free time working at no pay." ...|$|E
2500|$|Zvyagintsev said [...] "The entire {{success of}} the film depends on the cast. So <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> long time finding exactly the right people. I always have {{an image of a}} {{particular}} character in mind, and then audition many actors and keep comparing the essence of the character with the essence of the people I meet. When the virtual and the real characters almost coincide, I know I've found my actor." [...] Zvyagintsev tried to avoid casting Konstantin Lavronenko who played a lead role in his previous film, The Return, but said [...] "In the end I couldn't find anyone else who could be his equal." [...] Zvyagintsev postponed filming and waited twelve months for actress Maria Bonnevie who had a year-long contract with the Royal Dramatic Theatre in Stockholm.|$|E
60|$|It's {{really too}} disheartening. <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>an</b> hour {{every day of}} my life making the best {{complexion}} in Monte Carlo, and you think it's natural. Why, I might as well be a dairymaid of eighteen.|$|R

2500|$|She {{did well}} at school, {{was an avid}} reader, {{particularly}} world classics, and enjoyed history and science fiction {{and going to the}} cinema and theatre. Korshunov remembered [...] "She never misses a chance of buying new books when competing in other places. Elena swallows one book after another. I see one book lying, next to her bag one day, a new one is there the next day." [...] She played checkers. She enjoyed going on angling trips with Viktor, her father, and Gennady. [...] "I like to read and listen to music, but mostly I enjoy a few quiet hours by the water. I love to go fishing. <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> lot of time fishing with my father or my coach, either on a lake in a boat, or {{on the banks of the}} Neva." [...] She enjoyed cooking and baking. As with many gymnasts she has a fondness for ice cream.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's bad," [...] said Hopkins, {{shifting}} uneasily, [...] "for I haven't much to spend, myself. But {{most money}} is fooled away in politics. When <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> cent it counts, I can tell you." ...|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Truefitt put {{his pipe}} {{down on the}} table and stared blankly before him. [...] "That’s the worst of it," [...] he said, forlornly; [...] "but {{something}} will have to be done. I’ve been engaged three weeks now, and every time <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> few minutes with Cecilia—Miss Willett—I have to tell a lie about it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Three long miserable years did <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> as <b>a</b> captive {{among the}} Moors, having lost all, my ships and all I had, and {{being forced to}} row their galleys, gli scomunicati." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "He's {{the worst}} of them all. He never speaks {{to me that he}} doesn't insult me. I don't know why. I've tried my best to get into his good graces, but I can't. Your uncle I like, and Mrs. Meeker is very kind; but all the others seem to be sworn enemies. I don't think I could stand it if it weren't for Landon. <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> good deal of time with him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do you think," [...] Mr. Fentolin went on, [...] "that <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> great fortune {{buying the}} secrets of the world, that I live from day to day with the risk of ignominious {{detection}} always hovering about me--do you think that I do this and am yet unprepared to run the final risks of life and death? Have you ever talked with a murderer, Mr. Dunster? Has curiosity ever taken you within the walls of Sing Sing? Have you sat within the cell of a doomed man and felt the thrill of his touch, of his close presence? Well, I will not ask you those questions. I will simply tell you that you are talking to one now." ...|$|E
60|$|The eldest Miss Larkins knows officers. It is {{an awful}} thing to bear. I see them {{speaking}} {{to her in the}} street. I see them cross the way to meet her, when her bonnet (she has a bright taste in bonnets) is seen coming down the pavement, accompanied by her sister's bonnet. She laughs and talks, and seems to like it. <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> good deal of my own spare time in walking up and down to meet her. If I can bow to her once in the day (I know her to bow to, knowing Mr. Larkins), I am happier. I deserve a bow now and then. The raging agonies I suffer {{on the night of the}} Race Ball, where I know the eldest Miss Larkins will be dancing with the military, ought to have some compensation, if there be even-handed justice in the world.|$|E

6000|$|At another time, however, I had an {{opportunity}} of seeing the Lifeboat in action. It was when <b>I</b> was <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> couple of weeks on board of the [...] "Gull" [...] Lightship, which lies between Ramsgate and the Goodwins.|$|R

6000|$|... "Paul," [...] Mr. Bundercombe continued, [...] "I am {{playing a}} part. I am playing {{the part of}} a silly old fool. It isn't easy sometimes, but I am keeping it up. <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> good part of my time in that beastly little parlor, having my nails done over and over again. The girl is bored to death; and I--though I flatter myself I don't show it--I guess I'm bored to death too. I've kept it up all right until now and the job comes off to-morrow. Miss Blanche is {{convinced}} that my interest in her is sentimental and she has occasionally not been quite so careful as she might have been. I have picked up here and there certain small details that enable me to form a very fair idea as to the nature of this venture in which I was invited to participate. The last few days I have been hesitating whether I should take you into my confidence or not. As it happens you have forced it. Have you anything particular to do to-morrow?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You will easily suspect {{from all}} this disorder, Mr. Brant, that <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> greater part of my time here, and that I seldom see much company. Mr. Peyton {{occasionally}} comes in long enough to stumble over a footstool or upset a vase, and I think Mary and Susy avoid it from a firm conviction that there is work concealed in these baskets. But I have my books here, and in the afternoons, behind these thick walls, one forgets the incessant stir and restlessness of the dreadful winds outside. Just now you were foolish enough to tempt them while you were nervous, or worried, or listless. Take my word for it, it's a great mistake. There is no more use fighting them, as I tell Mr. Peyton, than of fighting the people born under them. I have my own opinion that these winds were sent only to stir this lazy race of mongrels into activity, but they are enough to drive us Anglo-Saxons into nervous frenzy. Don't you think so? But you are young and energetic, and perhaps you are not affected by them." ...|$|E
60|$|Having said thus {{much about}} my manner of writing, I will add {{that with my}} large books <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> {{good deal of time}} over the general {{arrangement}} of the matter. I first make the rudest outline in two or three pages, and then a larger one in several pages, a few words or one word standing for a whole discussion or series of facts. Each one of these headings is again enlarged and often transferred before I begin to write in extenso. As in several of my books facts observed by others have been very extensively used, and as I have always had several quite distinct subjects in hand at the same time, I may mention that I keep from thirty to forty large portfolios, in cabinets with labelled shelves, into which I can at once put a detached reference or memorandum. I have bought many books, and at their ends I make an index of all the facts that concern my work; or, if the book is not my own, write out a separate abstract, and of such abstracts I have a large drawer full. Before beginning on any subject I look to all the short indexes and make a general and classified index, and by taking the one or more proper portfolios I have all the information collected during my life ready for use.|$|E
6000|$|... "Then we'll {{consider}} it as decided," [...] said Wisbech. [...] "It seems to me <b>I</b> could <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> month or two in this province very satisfactorily, and we'll go down to Victoria together, {{as soon as you}} have carried out this timber-cutting contract." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Remember, Ermine, <b>I</b> can't <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> {{winter in}} Scotland. A cold always makes the ball {{remind me of}} its {{presence}} in my chest, and I was told that if I spent a winter at home, it must be on the Devonshire coast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I really don't {{know what}} I ought to do," [...] she answered. [...] "I {{might be a}} {{restraint}} upon you--you can't want me always at hand; and <b>I</b> could <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> month or two with Dorothy. She has several times told me to come." ...|$|R
6000|$|In {{the mean}} time {{things were not}} going on very pleasantly at the brewery, and Mr. Tappitt was making himself {{unpleasant}} in the bosom of his family. A lawsuit will sometimes make a man extremely pleasant company {{to his wife and}} children. Even a losing lawsuit will sometimes do so, if he be well backed up in his pugnacity by his lawyer, and if the matter of the battle be one in which he can take a delight to fight. [...] "Ah," [...] a man will say, [...] "though <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> thousand pounds over it, I'll stick to him like a burr. He shan't shake me off." [...] And at such times he is almost sure to be in a good humour, and in a generous mood. Then let his wife ask him for money for a dinner-party, and his daughters for new dresses. He has taught himself for the moment to disregard money, and to think that he can sow five-pound notes broadcast without any inward pangs. But such was by no means the case with Mr. Tappitt. His lawyer Honyman was not backing him up; and as cool reflection came upon him he was afraid of trusting his interests to those other men, Sharpit and Longfite. And Mrs. Tappitt, when cool reflection came on her, had begun to dread the ruin which it seemed possible that terrible young man might inflict upon them. She had learned already, though Mrs. Ray had not, how false had been that report which had declared Luke Rowan to be frivolous, idle, and in debt. To her it was very manifest that Honyman was afraid of the young man; and Honyman, though he might not be as keen as some others, was at any rate honest. Honyman also thought that if the brewery were given up to Rowan that thousand a year which had been promised would be paid regularly; and to this solution of the difficulty Mrs. Tappitt was gradually bending herself to submit as the best which an untoward fate offered to them. Honyman himself had declared to her that Mr. Tappitt, if he were well advised, would admit Rowan in as a partner, on equal terms as regarded power and ultimate possession, but with that lion's share of the immediate concern for himself which Rowan offered. But this she knew that Tappitt would not endure; and she knew, also, that if he were brought to endure it for a while, it would ultimately lead to terrible sorrows. [...] "They would be knocking each other about with the pokers, Mr. Honyman," [...] she had said; [...] "and where would the custom be when that got into the newspapers?" [...] "If I were Mr. Tappitt, I would just let him have his own way," [...] Honyman had replied. [...] "That shows that you don't know Tappitt," [...] had been Mrs. Tappitt's rejoinder. No;--the thousand a year and dignified retirement in a villa had recommended itself to Mrs. Tappitt's mind. She would use all her influence to attain that position,--if only she could bring herself to feel assured that the thousand a year would be forthcoming.|$|E

5000|$|Tian {{has said}} that, [...] "When I do have free time I {{try to find}} random, new things and I am obsessed with {{learning}} new things and meeting new people. I do martial arts and running. I like to sew and design. I definitely like to look up new music. <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> lot of time doing that and I like to produce my own".|$|E
5000|$|Frontman Dustin Bates {{outlines}} {{the process for}} creating the album: I start with sonic goals. This time I had {{a greater understanding of}} what instrumentation and even arrangements and genres, to an extent, would be amalgamated into these songs… and then chord structures. Once there’s a great chord structure then I always scat melodies. Then once I have the melody <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>an</b> exorbitant amount of time coming up with lyrics that fit the theme that I want, over that melody. I think it is the way I’ve always written, then after that a readdressing of the musical soundscape and flushing out of the atmosphere of it as well.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You {{could save}} me from much if you would. I work like a horse, and <b>I</b> never <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> {{shilling}} that <b>I</b> can help. I want nothing for myself,-- nothing for myself. Nobody has suffered as I have. But Felix never thinks of {{me for a}} moment.' ...|$|R
60|$|As I {{remember}} him, he was {{a rather}} large man with elephantiasis of the temper. I distinctly recalled one occasion when <b>I</b> was <b>spending</b> <b>a</b> school vacation at his home, and he found me trying to shave old Duggie, then a kid of fourteen, with his razor.|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> {{great deal}} of time on preparatory work, and less time on final composition. Some items I have not {{finished}} within the last few years. Important themes which are repeated in the opera, are used by me objectively, without any reference to a particular situation, for studies in counterpoint. Gradually, from this chaos of thoughts and sketches something orderly and definite begins to emerge. Everything extraneous is discarded. That which is unquestionably suitable remains.|$|E
5000|$|... "The newspaper, however, {{was horrible}} yellow and {{sometimes}} even reactionary, although {{it was part of}} the holding of Sergei Kiriyenko. And I realized that <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> life for nothing - and began to write a novel. At first, it was a novel about love, but eventually (I worked three or four years), it has turned into a novel about Chechnya as about the most powerful experience of my life - as the saying goes, what we are doing always turns out to a Kalashnikov rifle." ...|$|E
50|$|Well, {{geography}} {{is about the}} world around you so <b>I</b> <b>spend</b> <b>a</b> lot of time staring out of my window! In between staring, I get information from books, TV programmes, magazines and the internet. I am {{also a member of}} the Royal Geographical Society (with Institute of British Geographers) in London. It's where all the great geographical expeditions of the past set out from. They have a fantastic library and lots of things belonging to explorers like Captain Scott (included stuffed penguins) and David Livingstone (including his diary, boots etc). The trouble is, finding out about deserts or poles etc is so fascinating, I tend to get carried away and do far more research than I can cram into the book.|$|E
