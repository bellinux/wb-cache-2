5|$|I {{had that}} beat {{actually}} {{before she got}} to the studio. So she came in, she heard that beat and was like, 'Yeah, that's what I want.' That {{was one of the first}} records we had. I didn't really know what to do for <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't hear nothing else that was on the album, but I just felt like she didn't have that bounce on her album.|$|E
2500|$|In {{reference}} to the actual murders, Norris stated that after he unsuccessfully attempted to strangle Lucinda Schaefer, Bittaker had strangled her with a wire coat hanger. The pair had then thrown her body into a location {{at or near the}} San Dimas Canyon. In {{reference to}} the murder of Andrea Hall, Norris stated he had been told by Bittaker to drive to a nearby store to purchase alcohol when Hall was murdered, after which he returned to find Bittaker, smiling and holding Polaroid pictures he had taken of Hall after informing her he intended to kill her. With reference to victims Jacqueline Lamp and Jackie Gilliam, Norris stated that the two girls were held captive for [...] "over a day" [...] before being murdered, adding that Bittaker had killed Gilliam before he himself bludgeoned Lamp about the head as Bittaker strangled her. When discussing the abuse and torture of Shirley Lynette Ledford, Norris stated he had, upon the insistence of Bittaker, committed the actual murder of Ledford, adding Bittaker had informed him that [...] "I should kill <b>her,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> hadn't killed anyone yet. I knew this was coming, so I agreed." [...] Norris then confessed to having killed Ledford by strangling her with a coat hanger, which he had tightened with pliers in much the same manner Bittaker had with previous victims Lucinda Schaefer and Jacqueline Lamp. Norris then stated the pair had driven to Sunland, where he discarded Shirley Ledford's body upon the front lawn as Bittaker waited in his van.|$|E
60|$|PURDIE. I read to Mabel aloud for an hour. I did {{it out of}} {{kindness}} to <b>her,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> had met you.|$|E
60|$|I {{stared at}} her and inquired <b>her</b> name, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{did not know what}} else to say.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh no, no; Kalliope protested, and <b>I</b> {{overpowered}} <b>her,</b> because--- <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was foolish, and I thought Aunt Jane interfering.' ...|$|R
5000|$|... "No; I did {{not kill}} <b>her,</b> <b>because</b> if <b>I</b> had I would have {{declared}} it, as I have done with the others." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, I do! Ariadne plagues {{me every}} time I see <b>her,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't wear ear-rings after all the trouble I had getting ready for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; I mind <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{thought she}} was running verra hard for a wee machine. If yon man's a friend o' yours, ye'll no' catch him easy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do {{you suppose}} {{she would like}} me better for sacrificing you? She is not a woman to be flattered because I made myself despicable--to believe that I must be true to <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was a dastard to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'll {{come up with}} you, mother, but you'd {{better go}} to <b>her</b> alone, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> expect she's not {{forgotten}} the last time I saw her.' ...|$|R
60|$|I rose {{to follow}} <b>her</b> example--partly <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{suspected}} <b>her</b> of attempting some treachery upstairs with Laura, partly <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was resolved not to remain {{alone in the}} same room with her husband.|$|R
6000|$|... "Annan water's wading deep, And my love Annie's wondrous bonny; And I am laith she suld weet <b>her</b> feet, <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> love <b>her</b> best of ony.|$|R
6000|$|... "My name is Maxby," [...] said I, quickly, for I was {{becoming}} nervously impatient. [...] "I am quite {{a stranger to}} Mrs Liston, but I would see <b>her,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> bring her news--news of importance--in fact a message from her long-lost son." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I wish," [...] she said, with {{something}} like a sob in her voice, [...] "it were possible that you shouldn't do this." [...] She stopped abruptly, and I {{did not look at}} <b>her,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> could feel the effort she was making to control herself.|$|E
6000|$|... "Damn you, {{what do you}} mean, {{you little}} minx?" [...] he asked. [...] "Why do you say I killed <b>her,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> did what I thought the best for all of us? No woman had a better husband, as I am sure she {{acknowledges}} in heaven to-day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Please, sir, Mrs. Rawlins {{hit me with}} <b>her</b> fist <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{had only}} done seven sprigs. She knocked me down, and I {{did not come to}} for ever so long." ...|$|R

5000|$|American R&B singer, Amerie, {{recorded}} {{an answer}} back (remix) to the single. The song was included on <b>her</b> first Mixtape, <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> Love It Volume 1 (the mixtape that was released to accompany <b>her</b> third studio <b>Because</b> <b>I</b> Love It). The song however {{did not appear}} on the final album. [...] "Because I Love It" [...] was released to international markets only.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, yes; Mary told me. I'm so glad of it. I {{always liked}} Dr Crofts very much. I have not congratulated <b>her,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> didn't {{know whether it}} was a secret. But Crofts was there last night, and if it is a secret he didn't seem {{to be very careful about}} keeping it." ...|$|E
60|$|This I said to <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{hated the}} meanness of concealment, not because I lost by the bargain of {{boarding}} them: {{for the three}} poor things did not eat much more than sparrows: and I've often since calculated that I had a clear twenty pounds a year profit out of them.|$|E
6000|$|... "I show {{dislike of}} Dona Rosita?" [...] stammered Demorest, in surprise. [...] "Come, Joan," [...] he added, with a {{forgiving}} smile, [...] "you don't mean {{to imply that}} I dislike <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> couldn't get up a thrilling interest in an old story I've heard from every gossip in the pueblo since I can remember." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why! How can {{you ask the}} question? Because no time is to be lost in {{frightening}} my old housekeeper out of <b>her</b> wits, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> must go {{and prepare}} a dinner for you, to be sure." ...|$|R
60|$|I didn't keep {{copies of}} <b>her</b> letters <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{wanted to get}} her and her letters out of my mind, finally and forever. Besides, I didn't choose. to emulate her duplicity by any sort of dissimulation.|$|R
5000|$|At the execution, {{she tried}} to give a reason for her actions: [...] "the Devil met me in the street, and bid me kill <b>her,</b> and <b>because</b> <b>I</b> would not he beat me about the head and back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was Hannah Morrison! She reeled against me; {{and when}} I--such a fool as I was!--pitied <b>her,</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> {{was on my}} way home to you, and was {{thinking}} about you and loving you, and was so happy in it, and asked her how she came to that, she struck me, and told me to--to--ask my--husband!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, mother, you {{can easily}} say, what is really the fact, that you {{naturally}} felt an interest in <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> picked {{her out of the}} water. Besides, if people make remarks they will soon be tired of that; and if not, I can get into some scrape or other and give them something else to talk about." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{next moment}} I didn't care {{whether she had}} or whether she hadn't. She did not reply to my kindly meant enquiry. Instead, her hand swept through {{the air in the}} form of an ample semi-circle. It {{terminated}} on my ear. It was not a small hand; it was not a soft hand; it was not that sort of hand. The sound of the contact rang through the room like a pistol shot; I beard it with my other ear. I sprang at her, and catching her before she had recovered her equilibrium, kissed her. I did not kiss <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> wanted to. I kissed <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> could not box her ears back in return, which I should have preferred doing. I kissed her, hoping it would make her mad. It did. If a look could have killed me, such would have been the tragic ending of this story. It did not kill me; it did me good.|$|E
6000|$|... "And now, my dear {{father and}} mother, you will {{perceive}} that Miss Bayard will not break <b>her</b> heart <b>because</b> <b>I</b> happen to love Dus Malbone. I see by your look, Katrinke, {{that you have}} had some hint of this backsliding also." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{brought my}} old doll, but <b>I</b> keep <b>her</b> hidden <b>because</b> <b>I</b> am {{too big to}} play with her, and yet I can't bear to throw her away, I'm so fond of her," [...] said Rose, {{continuing}} her confidences in a whisper.|$|R
6000|$|Margaret {{gave him}} his pouch and he smiled, [...] "The tobacco's yours, sir. Miss Jardine is very kind. Well, I {{reckoned}} on <b>her</b> kindness, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> want to borrow a quantity of truck, but we'll talk about this again. Do you know where Stannard is?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Poor Ayala! Do not {{be stupid}} enough to accuse me of [...] pitying <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> cannot be the knight to release her; [...] but I cannot but think how happy she would be at Stalham, [...] {{struggling}} to beat you and Mr. Ponsonby at lawn tennis, [...] and then risking a cropper when the happy days of November [...] should come round.--Your loving cousin, ...|$|E
60|$|But {{one evening}} I got {{her away from}} the smell of halibut and {{linoleum}} long enough to read to her the manuscript of this story, which then ended before her entrance into it. I read it to <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> knew that all the printing-presses in the world were running to try to please her and some others. And I asked her about it.|$|E
60|$|Now I {{said nothing}} in answer, {{for this reason}} only: that when I heard Nada call me father, not knowing me, and saw her clasp my knees and pray {{to me in my}} daughter's name, I, who was childless save for her, went nigh to weeping. But she thought that I did not answer <b>her</b> <b>because</b> <b>I</b> was angry, and about to drag her to this unknown chief, and implored me the more even with tears.|$|E
6000|$|Carrie smiled absently, though {{something}} in his attitude caused her a slight uneasiness. [...] "Looking at Mrs. Custer's turkeys, I believe," [...] she said. [...] "It shows <b>her</b> good-nature, <b>because</b> <b>I</b> don't think they appeal to her {{any more than they}} do to me." ...|$|R
5000|$|Elaine: Yeah, let me {{tell you}} something: this is all in her mind, OK? She is insane. She thinks <b>I</b> made <b>her</b> sick <b>because</b> <b>I</b> coughed on <b>her</b> doorknob, rubbed her stapler in my armpit, and put her {{keyboard}} on my butt. Yeah, she's a wacko.|$|R
