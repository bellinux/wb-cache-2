5|$|Ferraro {{had felt}} unusually tired {{at the end}} of her second senate campaign. In , she was {{diagnosed}} with multiple myeloma, a form of blood cancer where plasma cells secrete abnormal antibodies known as Bence-Jones proteins, which can cause bones to disintegrate and dump toxic amounts of calcium into the bloodstream. She did not publicly disclose the illness until , when she went to Washington to successfully press in Congressional <b>hearings</b> <b>for</b> passage of the Hematological Cancer Research Investment and Education Act. A portion of the Act created the Geraldine Ferraro Cancer Education Program, which directs the U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services to establish an education program for patients of blood cancers and the general public. Ferraro became a frequent speaker on the disease, and an avid supporter and honorary board member of the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Funding {{problems}} delayed construction even further. In February 1982, President Ronald Reagan proposed cutting Metro construction funds by 21.4 {{percent to}} just $295 million a year. Planned Green Line construction constituted 40.5 percent of Metro's construction budget, and the cuts threatened {{to cancel the}} entire Green Line. To African American community leaders, the cuts were evidence that Metrorail was meant for suburban white commuters while inner city African Americans were relegated to taking Metrobus. Despite the funding troubles, Metro planned to seek contractors in March 1982 for a $60 million contract to tunnel under the Anacostia River, a $60 million contract to build the Anacostia Station, and a $100 million contract to build the Navy Yard Station. But on March 16, 1982, Judge Ramsey barred Metro from spending any money {{on the construction of}} the Rosecroft Raceway route for the southern half of the Green Line. Judge Ramsey held that Metro had decided to shift the Green Line route without properly advertising the public hearings, which the transit system would now be required to hold (delaying construction of the Green Line and Anacostia Station by at least a year). Although Metro had advertised the hearings, Judge Ramsey said, the advertisements contained the same wording flaws that had precipitated the Maryland lawsuit. Metro subsequently scheduled new <b>hearings</b> <b>for</b> June 1982.|$|E

25|$|Aided by a {{favorable}} {{resolution of the}} Linn County Chamber of Commerce, Macpherson was able to help orchestrate a hearing on land use planning before the Linn County Commission, the elected county government authority for rural Linn County.
