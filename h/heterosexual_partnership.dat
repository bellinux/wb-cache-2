Females must be able to prove there is a medical indication they cannot carry and be no older than 50 at the time of the contract. As in all jurisdictions, surrogates must pass medical and psychological tests so they can prove to the court that they are medically and mentally fit. What is unique about Greece is that it is the only country in Europe, and one of only countries in the world where the surrogate then has no rights over the child.

Within an Equal Partnership discourse, abortion, paired with the assumption of foetal personhood, was equated with violating an equal <b>heterosexual</b> <b>partnership</b> and a man’s patriarchal duty to protect a child.

40|$|This article explores {{understandings}} {{and practices}} of marriage in a congregation from the growing British evangelical Christian movement New Frontiers International (NFI).

Estimation of momentary degree distributions and mixing patterns typically relies on cross-sectional survey data, and, in the context of heterosexual networks, we describe how this results in two sets of reports that need not be consistent with each other. The reported momentary degree distributions and mixing totals are related through a series of constraints, however.

Twenty-four volunteer Finnish women, aged 19 to 58 years, with a history of different manifestations of intimate partner violence (IPV) participated in open-ended interviews. The data were analyzed by the method developed by Colaizzi. The findings revealed that some of the women who opposed all violence on ethical grounds did not label their behavior as violent; some others minimized or justified their violent behavior. The findings offer professional insight into women’s violent behavior and call for a readjustment in approaches to work in the area. Prevention and early identification of IPV require knowledge of the various manifestations and individual meanings of violence. Helping methods should provide women with the opportunity to talk about their abusive behavior and to confront and address their feelings of guilt, disappointment, and shame.

40|$|The 1970 s were a {{prolific}} era for Black women's writing. During {{what is now}} {{referred to as the}} Black Women's Literary Renaissance, Black women writers worked to center Black women's experiences in American and African American literary "traditions" that had theretofore excluded them. This project examines how more recent writing by Black women signifies on the issues and concerns that defined the Renaissance, particularly issues of historical recovery and Black male sexism. Despite the progressive nature of the Renaissance, Black women consistently found that their work was at odds with what Farah Jasmine Griffin calls, "the promise of protection," propagated by Black Nationalism. In response to this patriarchal promise, writers like Toni Morrison, for example, created characters, who like Sula Peace, chose a space of solitude over the patriarchal offer of "protection. " I argue that contemporary Black women writers are re-thinking spaces of solitude, and instead proposing a "promise of partnership" that is grounded in a critical gender consciousness. "Sometimes Folk Need More": Black Women Writers Dwelling in the Beyond" is an interdisciplinary study of reformed partnership in the cultural productions of four contemporary Black women writers. Appropriating Homi Bhabha's concept of "dwelling in the beyond," I discuss how these writers imagine a productive and secure space for intra-racial, heterosexual dialogue in Toni Morrison's, Paradise, Erna Brodber's, Louisiana, Kasi Lemmons' film, Eve's Bayou, and Danzy Senna's short story, "The Land of Beulah. " Each of these texts suggest that not only do promises of protection leave characters needing "something more," but that previous narratives of kinship and family that were a hallmark of Black women's Renaissance era writing, leave the characters needing "something more," as well. As the texts interrogate familial and heterosexual relationships, they consistently conclude that "the more" is a reformed <b>heterosexual</b> <b>partnership</b> that is grounded in unmotivated respect...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the past}} 30 years {{there has been}} a {{considerable}} {{increase in the number of}} people living alone; in the UK, the proportion of one-person households almost doubled between 1971 and 2000, rising from 17 % to 31 % of households (ONS, 2002). The research drawn on here explores the experience and representation of a rapidly growing sub-group of one-person households identified by Hall et al (1999) as female, metropolitan, managerial/professional, educated and mobile. The paper concentrates on questions surrounding the identity of those who have been termed the 'new single women' (Whitehead, 2003). In much of the specific 'single women' literature, the 'problem' of the single woman has been understood as residing in her social construction; her stigmatisation and marginalisation as an 'other', relative to the norms of <b>heterosexual</b> <b>partnership</b> and motherhood. It is argued here that significant contextual changes in the landscape of interpersonal relationships demand a reconsideration of the way in which singleness is understood sociologically. The paper draws on semi-structured, in-depth interviews conducted in London and the South-East with a small sample of women (15) fitting the characteristics identified by Hall et al. They were aged 34 - 50, never-married, currently lived alone, were not in a relationship and had never had children. All who volunteered for interview were heterosexual. The women were recruited using a snowball method with the reasoning that 'word-of-mouth' would recruit a more varied range of individuals than might respond to a public call for those who self-identified as 'single' to come forward. Part of the interview schedule was constructed to elicit information concerning how the women negotiated their identity and the way in which they related themselves to the category of 'single woman'. The women were asked how they defined themselves, what they thought of the term spinster, and when they felt their singleness mattered (to themselves and to other people). They were also asked about their relationship and employment history, their daily lives and their future plans.

40|$|Introduction. In certain European countries, {{access to}} new {{reproductive}} techniques is particularly restricted. This {{is the case}} in France, where medically assisted procreation is available only to men and women in a stable relationship, of reproductive age, and with medically confirmed infertility. Reproductive age is not defined by law, but the French medical insurance system has fixed the upper limit at 43 years for women. Moreover, use of certain techniques such as oocyte donation is restricted and waiting lists are long. Other European countries, however, have more liberal laws on access and offer of fertility care. For these reasons, some French nationals go abroad for fertility care because they do not fulfil the conditions for medical cover or because they wish to maximise their chances of having a child. We describe here the transnational fertility paths that are in operation in France, taking one example: oocyte donation in Greece. Materials and methods. As part of a current study on cross-border fertility care in Europe, we carried out a one-month survey in 2010 in a Greek clinic which has a high demand for oocyte donation from foreign and in particular French patients. We interviewed all women of French nationality who were attending the clinic, alone or with their partners, and obtained 31 interviews. We also collected 24 self-report questionnaires completed by French patients in the medical centre. Results. Through the interviews, we identified the main social and demographic characteristics of French women seeking oocyte donation in Greece. In our population the proportion of women aged less than 43 years and over 43 years was the same, although most were aged over 40 years. The large majority was in a <b>heterosexual</b> <b>partnership,</b> had an intermediate occupational level and had no children. They had been attempting to have a child for several years and often had a history of medical treatment in France. The interviews also shed light on their personal and medical reasons for seeking oocyte donation abroad. In France, the women had been considered " too old " by the medical staff, the procedure required to obtain oocyte donation was too lengthy, and it was often their physician who had advised them to go abroad directly. Lastly, the interviews identified the reasons why the women chose Greece (quality and rapidity of medical management, only one stay abroad, assistance available from a French-speaking person, etc.) and how the cross-border procedure was organised in France and in Greece. Conclusion. Investigation of cross-border fertility care gives us an outside view of what, in France, fails to meet the new demands related to infertility treatment, or indeed the new expectations related to sociodemographic change. From a legal viewpoint, the French restrictions on oocyte donation are justified by medical arguments, but they are also coloured by a certain conformity to social norms regarding procreation and the family, the norm of maternal age and in particular the norm that considers " genetics is everything ". The women who travel to Greece for oocyte donation depart from these socially constructed norms. They are not aware of the medical risks related to their undertaking, or they declare that they assume them, since it is their own choice. They do not understand the restrictions imposed in France, and consider themselves more as symbols of present demographic change than as unconventional women...|$|E

40|$|Wie erfahren Väter die Veränderungen, die im Gefolge der Frauenbewegungen in heterosexuellen Partnerschaften und Familien stattgefunden haben? Wie gehen sie damit um, dass an sie als „Neue Väter“ Anforderungen gestellt werden, die teilweise inkompatibel mit ihren Männlichkeitsbildern sind? Eine Reaktion, die sich großer medialer Aufmerksamkeit erfreut, ist das Engagement in Väterinitiativen. Anja Wolde analysiert die kollektiven Deutungsmuster dieser Vereinigungen zwischen Selbsthilfegruppe und Lobby-Organisation. How do fathers {{experience}} {{the changes that}} have occurred in <b>heterosexual</b> <b>partnerships</b> and families following the women’s movement? How do they deal with the requirements placed on them as “new fathers,” which can be partially incompatible with their own images of masculinity? One reaction that has received great media attention has been their engagement in fatherhood initiatives. Anja Wolde analyses the collective patterns of interpretation of these initiatives, formed of a union between self-help group and lobby organization...|$|R
5000|$|While {{some women}} are {{aggressive}} and dominating to male partners, some {{studies show that the}} majority of abuse in <b>heterosexual</b> <b>partnerships,</b> at about 80% in the USA, is perpetrated by men. (Note that critics stress that this Department of Justice study examines crime figures, and does not specifically address domestic abuse figures. [...] While the categories of crime and domestic abuse may cross-over, most instances of domestic abuse are either not regarded as crimes or reported to police—critics thus argue that it is inaccurate to regard the DOJ study as a comprehensive statement on domestic abuse.) A 2002 study reports that ten percent of violence in the UK, overall, is by females against males. However, more recent data specifically regarding domestic abuse (including emotional abuse) report that 3 in 10 women, and 1 in 5 men, have experienced domestic abuse.|$|R
40|$|Chlamydia trachomatis {{causes a}} high number of sexually {{transmitted}} infections worldwide, but reproducible and precise strain typing to link partners is lacking. We evaluated multilocus sequence typing (MLST) for this purpose by detecting sequence types (STs) concordant for the ompA genotype, a single-locus typing standard. We tested samples collected during April 2000 -October 2003 from members of established <b>heterosexual</b> <b>partnerships</b> (dyads) in the Indianapolis, Indiana, USA, area who self-reported being coital partners within the previous 30 days. C. trachomatis DNA from 28 dyads was tested by MLST; sequences were aligned and analyzed for ST and phylogenetic relationships. MLST detected 9 C. trachomatis STs, 4 unique to Indianapolis; STs were identical within each dyad. Thirteen unique strains were identified; 9 (32 %) dyads harbored novel recombinant strains that phylogenetically clustered with strains comprising the recombinants. The high rate of novel C. trachomatis recombinants identified supports the use of MLST for transmission and strain diversity studies among at-risk populations...|$|R
5000|$|In {{addition}} {{to many of}} the anti-Caste and Tamil nationalist ideologies of the Self-Respect Movement, it is also widely regarded that the Self-Respect Movement, held as core, deeply feminist values. [...] Gender relationships were actively divorced from Brahminical patriarchy and women's rights over their physical, sexual and reproductive choices were celebrated. In Periyar's model of society, women were to be allowed access to contraception and even permanent birth control measures. This came {{at a time when the}} broad national discourse on birth control through influenced by the thoughts of leaders like Gandhi, was an almost unanimous condemnation of birth control. Women were given the right to choose partners as well as divorce them and remarry. Widowhood was not penalized through religious beliefs. <b>Heterosexual</b> <b>partnerships</b> were radically transformed by advocating for the erasure of gender hierarchies and roles; the sharing of domestic work, child-rearing were all paths to love through equality and service to society.|$|R
