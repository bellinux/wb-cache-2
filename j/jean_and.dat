5|$|The {{episode was}} written by George Meyer and {{directed}} by David Silverman. Executive producer Sam Simon and writers Al <b>Jean</b> <b>and</b> Mike Reiss {{came up with the}} idea for the episode. A co-worker had recently needed a blood transfusion and the writers thought it would be funny if Mr. Burns had one. Although Meyer was credited with writing the episode, <b>Jean</b> <b>and</b> Reiss re-wrote and polished the script. The episode includes the debut of the Olmec head Xtapolapocetl, which would become a common background prop in the Simpson home.|$|E
5|$|It guest starred Rod Steiger as Captain Tenille and Bob Denver as himself, with {{one-time}} The Simpsons writer Michael Carrington {{making an}} appearance as the Drill Sergeant.

5|$|A two-part, feature-length {{version of}} Hogfather {{starring}} David Jason {{and the voice}} of Ian Richardson was first aired on Sky One in the United Kingdom in December 2006, and on ION Television in the US in 2007. Pratchett was opposed to live action films about Discworld before because of his negative experience with Hollywood film makers. He changed his opinion when he saw that the director Vadim <b>Jean</b> <b>and</b> producer Rod Brown were very enthusiastic and cooperative.|$|E
5|$|Acadia's border was not {{formally}} demarcated by the Treaty of Utrecht, {{which became a}} cause of ongoing friction between the British and French, especially on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which both sides eventually fortified. The French interpreted the phrase ancient boundaries to imply only the peninsula of present-day Nova Scotia, thereby excluding the mainland between New England and the St. Lawrence, ÎLe St. <b>Jean,</b> <b>and</b> Cape Breton. This helped the Amerindians of Abenaquis, Malecites, and MicMacs to retain their sovereignty over their old hunting grounds.|$|E

5|$|<b>Jean</b> <b>and</b> Reiss left The Simpsons {{after its}} fourth season {{in order to}} create The Critic, an {{animated}} show about film critic Jay Sherman (voiced by Jon Lovitz); the show was executive produced by Brooks. It was first broadcast on ABC in January 1994 and was well received by critics, but did not catch on with viewers and was put on hiatus after six weeks. It returned in June 1994 and completed airing its initial production run. The Critic was moved to the Fox network for its second season. Since The Simpsons also aired on that network, Brooks was able to create a crossover between it and The Critic.|$|E
