5|$|Combined {{hormonal}} contraceptives {{include both}} an <b>estrogen</b> <b>and</b> a progestogen. Estrogen negative {{feedback on the}} anterior pituitary greatly decreases the release of FSH, which makes combined hormonal contraceptives more effective at inhibiting follicular development and preventing ovulation. Estrogen also reduces the incidence of irregular breakthrough bleeding. Several combined hormonal contraceptives—the pill, NuvaRing, and the contraceptive patch—are usually used {{in a way that}} causes regular withdrawal bleeding. In a normal cycle, menstruation occurs when <b>estrogen</b> <b>and</b> progesterone levels drop rapidly. Temporarily discontinuing use of combined hormonal contraceptives (a placebo week, not using patch or ring for a week) has a similar effect of causing the uterine lining to shed. If withdrawal bleeding is not desired, combined hormonal contraceptives may be taken continuously, although this increases the risk of breakthrough bleeding.|$|E
5|$|Risk {{factors for}} endometrial cancer include obesity, {{diabetes}} mellitus, breast cancer, use of tamoxifen, never {{having had a}} child, late menopause, high levels of <b>estrogen,</b> <b>and</b> increasing age. Immigration studies (migration studies), which examine the change in cancer risk in populations moving between countries with different rates of cancer, {{show that there is}} some environmental component to endometrial cancer. These environmental risk factors are not well characterized.|$|E
5|$|The female hormone estrogen, {{when used}} in the {{combined}} oral contraceptive pill and in perimenopausal hormone replacement therapy, {{has been associated with}} a two- to sixfold increased risk of venous thrombosis. The risk depends on the type of hormones used, the dose of <b>estrogen,</b> <b>and</b> the presence of other thrombophilic risk factors. Various mechanisms, such as deficiency of protein S and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, are said to be responsible.|$|E

The number of estrogen prescriptions decreased from 1975 to 1980, and then increased through 1986. Progestin use has increased since 1982; concomitant use of <b>estrogens</b> <b>and</b> progestins increased over time and was common in 1986.

5|$|During early pregnancy, type 1 lobules {{quickly become}} type 2 lobules because {{of changes in}} <b>estrogen</b> <b>and</b> {{progesterone}} levels. Maturing into type 3 and then reaching full differentiation as type 4 lobules requires an increase of human placental lactogen (hPL) which occurs {{in the last few}} months of pregnancy. According to the abortionbreast cancer hypothesis, if an abortion were to interrupt this sequence then it could leave a higher ratio of type 2 lobules than existed prior to the pregnancy. Russo and Russo have shown that mature breast cells have more time for DNA repair with longer cell cycles, accounting for the slightly reduced risk of breast cancer for parous women against the baseline risk for women who have never conceived and those who have conceived and terminated their pregnancies.|$|E
5|$|Smoking {{and the use}} of {{progestin}} {{are both}} protective against endometrial cancer. Smoking provides protection by altering the metabolism of <b>estrogen</b> <b>and</b> promoting weight loss and early menopause. This protective effect lasts long after smoking is stopped. Progestin is present in the combined oral contraceptive pill and the hormonal intrauterine device (IUD). Combined oral contraceptives reduce risk more the longer they are taken: by 56% after four years, 67% after eight years, and 72% after twelve years. This risk reduction continues for at least fifteen years after contraceptive use has been stopped. Obese women may need higher doses of progestin to be protected. Having had more than fiveinfants (grand multiparity) is also a protective factor, and having at least one child reduces the risk by 35%. Breastfeeding for more than 18months reduces risk by 23%. Increased physical activity reduces an individual's risk by 38–46%. There is preliminary evidence that consumption of soy is protective.|$|E
25|$|During pregnancy, high {{circulating}} {{concentrations of}} <b>estrogen</b> <b>and</b> progesterone increase prolactin levels by 10- to 20-fold. <b>Estrogen</b> <b>and</b> progesterone inhibit the stimulatory effects of prolactin on milk production. The abrupt drop of <b>estrogen</b> <b>and</b> progesterone levels following delivery allow prolactin—which temporarily remains high—to induce lactation.|$|E
