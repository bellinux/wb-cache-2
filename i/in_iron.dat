5|$|Bayley's tenure <b>in</b> <b>Iron</b> Maiden {{ended in}} January 1999 {{when he was}} asked to leave during a band meeting. The {{dismissal}} took place due to issues Bayley had experienced with his voice during the Virtual XI World Tour, although Janick Gers has since stated that this was partly the band's fault for forcing him to perform songs which were beyond his natural register.|$|E
5|$|Cooper reprises {{his role}} from The First Avenger and the Agent Carter short. Anton Vanko was {{previously}} portrayed by Yevgeni Lazarev <b>in</b> <b>Iron</b> Man 2; Ronin plays a younger {{version of the}} character. Gjokaj previously had a minor role in The Avengers. O'Quinn, Marque, and Anderson did not receive guest star credit in the episode. Additionally, Chris Evans appears as Steve Rogers / Captain America via archive footage from Captain America: The First Avenger.|$|E
5|$|During {{the siege}} at Montreuil-en-Bellay in 1147, {{a mixture of}} oils from nuts, {{cannabis}} and flax, was heated <b>in</b> <b>iron</b> containers, launched by mangonel, and burst into flames on impact. The Chinese made early grenades out of oil-soaked hemp and cotton, which were ignited and thrown by mangonels.|$|E

60|$|Henry and {{his friends}} went in the Foam, but Gascoyne was {{detained}} a prisoner on board the Talisman. Montague {{felt that it was}} his duty to put him <b>in</b> <b>irons,</b> but he could not prevail on himself to heap unnecessary indignity on the head of one who had rendered him such good service, so he left him at large, intending to put him <b>in</b> <b>irons</b> only when duty compelled him to do so.|$|R

Comes after claret in {{course of}} nature. Captain doesn't {{understand}} the 'lusion. All right, captain. Little learning dangerous thing." [...] He turned sharply on Mr. Watterson, who had remained inertly in his place. [...] "Put me <b>in</b> <b>irons,</b> heh! You put me <b>in</b> <b>irons,</b> you old Triton. Put me <b>in</b> <b>irons,</b> will you?" [...] His amiable mood was passing; before {{one could say}} so, it was past. He was meditating means of active offense. He gathered up the carving-knife and fork, and held them close under Mr. Watterson's nose. [...] "Smell that!" [...] he said, and frowned as darkly {{as a man of}} so little eyebrow could.|$|R
5|$|Extracts of {{the fruit}} body of Ramaria {{botrytis}} {{have been shown to}} favorably influence the growth and development of HeLa cells grown in tissue culture. The mushroom contains nicotianamine, an ACE inhibitor (angiotensin-converting enzyme). Nicotianamine is a metal-chelating compound essential <b>in</b> <b>iron</b> metabolism and utilization in plants. Several sterols have been isolated from the fruit bodies, 5α,6α-epoxy-3β-hydroxy-(22E)-ergosta-8(14),22-dien-7-one, ergosterol peroxide, cerevisterol, and 9α-hydroxycerevisterol, in addition to the previously unknown ceramide (2S,2R,3R,4E,8E)-N-2'-hydroxyoctadecanoyl-2-amino-9-methyl-4,8-heptade-cadiene-1,3-diol.|$|E
5|$|In nature, cobalt is {{frequently}} associated with nickel, {{and both are}} characteristic components of meteoric iron, though cobalt is much less abundant <b>in</b> <b>iron</b> meteorites than nickel. As with nickel, cobalt in meteoric iron alloys may have been well enough protected from oxygen and moisture to remain as the free (but alloyed) metal, though neither element is seen in that form in the ancient terrestrial crust.|$|E
5|$|M-189 is a north–south state {{trunkline}} {{highway in}} the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan. It {{serves as the}} continuation of Highway 139 (WIS139) from Wisconsin into Michigan, connecting to US Highway 2 (US2) <b>in</b> <b>Iron</b> River. M-189 has been largely unchanged since being designated in the 1930s, although a new bridge over the Brule River at the state line was built in 1988.|$|E

5|$|Mercury readily {{combines}} with aluminium {{to form a}} mercury-aluminium amalgam {{when the}} two pure metals come into contact. Since the amalgam destroys the aluminium oxide layer which protects metallic aluminium from oxidizing in-depth (as <b>in</b> <b>iron</b> rusting), even small amounts of mercury can seriously corrode aluminium. For this reason, mercury is not allowed aboard an aircraft under most circumstances {{because of the risk}} of it forming an amalgam with exposed aluminium parts in the aircraft.|$|E
5|$|On Earth, nickel occurs {{most often}} in {{combination}} with sulfur and iron in pentlandite, with sulfur in millerite, with arsenic in the mineral nickeline, and with arsenic and sulfur in nickel galena. Nickel is commonly found <b>in</b> <b>iron</b> meteorites as the alloys kamacite and taenite.|$|E
5|$|Partial capping (covering) of the site: The {{ore body}} <b>in</b> <b>Iron</b> Mountain was {{determined}} to be shallow, so this alternative was considered. However, the recurring high occurrence of fractures in the mountain made this inefficient, so it was also never implemented.|$|E

5|$|The Tesseract {{from the}} Thor post-credits scene {{appears as a}} MacGuffin in Captain America: The First Avenger. In the film, Dominic Cooper portrays a young Howard Stark, the father of Tony Stark, who hosts {{an early version of}} the Stark Expo, the fair Tony hosts <b>in</b> <b>Iron</b> Man 2. The final scene of the film {{includes}} a brief appearance by Jackson's Nick Fury followed by a teaser trailer for Marvel's The Avengers after the credits.|$|E
5|$|The largest {{consumer}} of tellurium is metallurgy <b>in</b> <b>iron,</b> stainless steel, copper, and lead alloys. The addition to steel and copper produces an alloy more machinable than otherwise. It is alloyed into cast iron for promoting chill for spectroscopy, where {{the presence of}} electrically conductive free graphite tends to interfere with spark emission testing results. In lead, tellurium improves strength and durability, and decreases the corrosive action of sulfuric acid.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA TiCN-based cermet die was {{utilised}} {{to improve}} the formability <b>in</b> <b>ironing</b> of stainless steel drawn cups. By employing the cermet die, additional coating was not required because {{it was made of}} hard TiCN having low friction. As a comparison, TiC-coated WC-Co, non-coated WC-Co and tool steel dies were used. The effects of the viscosity of a lubricant and the ironing speed on the formability for the cermet die were examined. The cermet die exhibited the largest seizure resistance. The performance of the cermet die <b>in</b> repeated <b>ironing</b> was evaluated. For repeated ironing using the cermet die, the occurrence of seizure was prevented up to 100 strokes. It was found that the cermet die with low friction was effective <b>in</b> <b>ironing</b> stainless steel drawn cups...|$|R

5|$|Whales defecate at the ocean's surface; their {{excrement}} {{is important}} for fisheries because it is rich <b>in</b> <b>iron</b> and nitrogen. The whale faeces are liquid and instead of sinking, they stay at the surface where phytoplankton feed off it.|$|E
5|$|Blast {{furnaces}} {{are currently}} rarely used in copper smelting, but modern lead smelting blast furnaces are much shorter than iron blast furnaces and are rectangular in shape. The overall shaft height is around 5 to 6 m. Modern lead blast furnaces {{are constructed using}} water-cooled steel or copper jackets for the walls, and have no refractory linings in the side walls. The base of the furnace is a hearth of refractory material (bricks or castable refractory). Lead blast furnaces are often open-topped rather than having the charging bell used <b>in</b> <b>iron</b> blast furnaces.|$|E
