40|$|Interest {{rates in}} China are {{composed}} of a mix of both market-determined interest <b>rates</b> (<b>interbank</b> <b>rates</b> and bond yields), and regulated interest rates (retail lending and deposit rates), reflecting China's gradual process of interest rate liberalization. This paper investigates the main drivers of China's <b>interbank</b> <b>rates</b> by developing a stylized theoretical model of China's interbank market and estimating an EGARCH model for 7 -day <b>interbank</b> repo <b>rates.</b> Our empirical findings suggest that movements in administered interest rates (part of the People's Bank of China's monetary policy toolkit) are important determinants of market-determined <b>interbank</b> <b>rates,</b> in both levels and volatility. The announcement effects of reserve requirement changes also influence <b>interbank</b> <b>rates,</b> as well as liquidity injections from open market operations in recent years. Our {{results indicate that the}} regulation of key retail interest rates influences the behaviour of marketdetermined <b>interbank</b> <b>rates,</b> which may have limited their independence as price signals. Further deposit rate liberalization should allow short-term <b>interbank</b> <b>rates</b> to play a more effective role as the primary indirect monetary policy tool...|$|R

40|$|The {{importance}} of <b>interbank</b> <b>rates</b> for unsecured funding has increased vastly {{the last decades}} with the expansion of nancial instruments. Today's <b>interbank</b> <b>rates</b> are arguably the most in uential benchmarks in pricing of assets and an important indicator on the state an economy. In {{the aftermath of the}} nancial crisis, the awareness of weaknesses of <b>interbank</b> <b>rates</b> surfaced. The awareness has led to a tightening of the regulations regarding the Norwegian <b>Interbank</b> O ered <b>Rate</b> (NIBOR). The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify the nature of NIBOR in both a domestic and international context, and expand on NIBOR's ability to accurately re ect the lending cost between Norwegian prime banks. The rst part of the paper uses the Nelson-Siegel and Vasicek models to compare o ered rates against observable nancing cost using unsecured corporate bonds. NIBOR has historically been quoted higher than both STIBOR and EURIBOR, and we nd that Norwegian banks contributing to NIBOR and STIBOR face the same nancing costs as European banks contributing to EURIBOR. This implies that the di erences between <b>interbank</b> <b>rates</b> cannot be justi ed by higher nancing costs. When comparing the <b>interbank</b> <b>rates</b> to domestic nancing costs, we are unable to determine if banks contributing to NIBOR are more or less accurate in the Norwegian interbank market compared to other interbank markets where these banks are present. In the second part of the paper, we compare individual interest rate quotes to credit default swaps, and observe an inconsistent relationship between panel banks' quotes and their market priced risk over time. By applying a hidden markov model, we examine individual short term behavioral dynamics during the opening of the day, and preceding the xing. Our results indicate that interpretation of information varies across participants, which is a possible weakness of the governance structure. nhhma...|$|R

50|$|Midpoint's {{peer-to-peer}} engine directly matches {{businesses and}} individuals with offsetting currency requirements {{resulting in the}} elimination of the ‘spread or margin’ component from all transactions. By doing so, users avoid the cost of the bid-ask spread levied by traditional banks and brokers - often from 2%-5% and instead uses the midpoint of the real-time interbank market rate. For its services, the company charges a single flat fee depending on the amount of the transaction. The foreign exchange rate is set at the time the currency match is made, and the rate used is always the midpoint of the prevailing <b>Interbank</b> <b>rate.</b> The technology eliminates the spread imposed by market makers and the need for a middleman or broker.

Results show no correlation between excess reserves and <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> movements, even though a Granger causality test shows that in the absence of money market intervention, the level of excess reserves may determine both the level of and changes in the <b>interbank</b> <b>rate.</b> There is also highly significant causality from Central Bank intervention to the target <b>interbank</b> <b>rate,</b> but no correlation between the two.

40|$|Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the Degree of Master of Business Administration at Strathmore UniversityIn the year 2015 and early 2016, the banking sector in Kenya faced liquidity risks coupled with skewed liquidity distribution and corporate governance issues that resulted in three banks (Dubai Bank, Imperial Bank and Chase Bank) being placed under statutory management. The Central Bank of Kenya observed that these commercial bank distresses {{may have contributed to}} liquidity shocks in the interbank market. Such shocks are impediments for an efficient interbank market and could lead to volatility in the <b>interbank</b> <b>rate.</b> Understanding the volatility of the <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> is crucial because volatile interbank rates are often seen as obscuring policy signals, while less volatile interest rates are often seen as promoting a more rapid and more predictable transmission of monetary policy. The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish the effect of commercial bank distresses (placement of Dubai Bank, Imperial Bank and Chase Bank under statutory management) on the volatility of the <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> in Kenya. The study applied an ARMA (p,q) -EGARCH (1, 1) model in analysing the volatility with a sample period spanning from January 2009 to December 2016. The results from the ARMA (p,q) -EGARCH (1, 1) model indicate that the volatility can be modelled through ARCH family of models. This is supported by the presence of volatility clustering, persistence and asymmetry in the <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> series. Further, the results indicate that the Imperial Bank distress did have a negative and significant effect on the <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> series, while the Imperial Bank and Chase Bank distresses did not have a significant effect on the <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> series. The three bank distresses did not have significant effects on the volatility of the <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> series, at the 5 % level of significance. The results also indicate that the 91 -Day Treasury Bill rate and the Central Bank Rate have a significant effect on the <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> series. On the basis of these study findings, it is evident that monetary policies (CBR) and fiscal policies (short-term government lending through the T-Bill rate) can be applied to smooth out the <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> (IBR) ...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{investigates the}} role of broad liquidity—the supply and demand for bank deposits—in the {{transmission}} of monetary policy. The model integrates deposit demand, loan production, asset pricing, and arbitrage between banking and asset markets. Broad liquidity conditions {{must be taken into}} account in the pursuit of interest rate policy for two reasons: (1) they influence the link between the <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> and market rates through their effect on the external finance premium, and (2) they affect the behavior of market rates that the central bank must target in order to maintain price stability. The paper shows how the production and use of broad liquidity influences the “neutral ” <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> consistent with balanced growth and stable inflation. It shows how and why <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> policy actions must be modified in light of broad liquidity considerations to stabilize inflation in response to shocks. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of monetary policy rate, <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> and savings deposit on inflation rate in Nigeria over the period of January, 2006 – November, 2014. To achieve the objective, an autoregressive distributed lag model was employed to estimate both the long-run and short-run models. The result of the long-run model reveals that monetary policy rate, <b>interbank</b> <b>rate</b> and savings deposit were all negatively and significantly affecting inflation rate within the studied period. In similar vein, in the short-run, monetary policy rate and interbank rates were negative and significant in determining inflation fluctuations.
