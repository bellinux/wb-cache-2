5|$|Aside from fossils clearly {{belonging}} to Plateosaurus, {{there is much}} prosauropod material from the German Knollenmergel in museum collections, most of it labeled as Plateosaurus, that {{does not belong to}} the type species and possibly not to Plateosaurus at all. Some of this material is not diagnostic; other material has been recognized to be <b>different,</b> <b>but</b> was never sufficiently described.|$|E
5|$|DNA {{analysis}} has shown honeyeater family Meliphagidae {{to be related}} to the Pardalotidae (pardalotes), Acanthizidae (Australian warblers, scrubwrens, thornbills, etc.), and the Maluridae (Australian fairy-wrens) in a large Meliphagoidea superfamily. The Papuan black myzomela, (Myzomela nigrita), found in Indonesia and Papua New Guinea is also known as the black honeyeater. It is a <b>different</b> <b>but</b> related species.|$|E
5|$|In other words, column j of A {{expresses the}} image of vj {{in terms of the}} basis vectors wi of W; thus this {{relation}} uniquely determines the entries of the matrix A. The matrix depends on the choice of the bases: different choices of bases give rise to <b>different,</b> <b>but</b> equivalent matrices. Many of the above concrete notions can be reinterpreted in this light, for example, the transpose matrix AT describes the transpose of the linear map given by A, with respect to the dual bases.|$|E

5|$|Silver birch {{can easily}} be {{confused}} with the similar downy birch (Betula pubescens). Yet, downy birch are characterised by hairy leaves and young shoots whereas the same parts on silver birch are hairless. The leaf base of silver birch is usually a right angle to the stalk while for downy birch it is rounded. In terms of genetic structure the trees are quite <b>different</b> <b>but</b> do, however occasionally hybridise.|$|E
5|$|The Elves of the Third Clan, or Teleri, {{who reached}} Eldamar {{later than the}} Noldor and the Vanyar, spoke a <b>different</b> <b>but</b> closely related tongue, usually called Telerin. It was seen by some Elves to be just another dialect of Quenya. This {{was not the case}} with the Teleri for whom their tongue was {{distinct}} from Quenya. After the Vanyar left the city of Túna, Telerin and Noldorin Quenya grew closer.|$|E
5|$|The current {{highway that}} bears the M-57 moniker {{is the second}} to do so. The first is now M-75 in the Northern Lower Peninsula. This second highway was {{designated}} in the 1930s along a <b>different,</b> <b>but</b> parallel, routing. The first major changes shifted that routing southward to the current corridor in stages. Through additional extensions and truncations, the modern routing was formed by the 1970s.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} <b>different,</b> <b>but</b> equivalent, axiomatizations of Peano arithmetic. While some axiomatizations, {{such as the}} one just described, use a {{signature}} that only has symbols for 0 and the successor, addition, and multiplications operations, other axiomatizations use the language of ordered semirings, including an additional order relation symbol. One such axiomatization begins with the following axioms that describe a discrete ordered semiring.|$|E
5|$|Although {{advocates and}} {{practitioners}} of scientific jury selection claim {{the practice is}} overwhelmingly effective at choosing juries that will render the desired verdict, its true effect is often more difficult to discern. Part of this difficulty is in duplicating the conditions of a real trial. In one experiment, two kinds of shadow juries watched a trial and rendered a verdict. The {{results indicated that the}} juries were substantially <b>different,</b> <b>but</b> that this difference was likely due to the two experimental juries’ knowledge that they were not deciding an actual verdict, prompting a lower burden of proof.|$|E

5|$|American {{football}} is by several measures {{the most popular}} spectator sport; the National Football League (NFL) has the highest average attendance of any sports league in the world, and the Super Bowl is watched by millions globally. Baseball has been regarded as the U.S. national sport since the late 19th century, with Major League Baseball (MLB) being the top league. Basketball and ice hockey are the country's next two leading professional team sports, with the top leagues being the National Basketball Association (NBA) and the National Hockey League (NHL). These four major sports, when played professionally, each occupy a season at <b>different,</b> <b>but</b> overlapping, times of the year. College football and basketball attract large audiences. In soccer, the country hosted the 1994 FIFA World Cup, the men's national soccer team qualified for ten World Cups and the women's team has won the FIFA Women's World Cup three times; Major League Soccer is the sport's highest league in the United States (featuring 19 American and 3 Canadian teams).|$|E
5|$|Czechoslovak {{education}} in the Czech and German language ceased to exist. About 35,000 Czechoslovaks emigrated to core Czechoslovakia (the later Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia) by choice or forcibly. The behaviour of the new Polish authorities was <b>different</b> <b>but</b> similar in nature {{to that of the}} Czechoslovak ones before 1938. Two political factions appeared: socialists (the opposition) and rightists (loyal to the new Polish national authorities). Leftist politicians and sympathizers were discriminated against and often fired from work. The Polish political system was artificially implemented in Zaolzie. The local Poles continued to feel like second-class citizens and a majority of them were dissatisfied with the situation after October 1938. Zaolzie remained a part of Poland for only 11 months until the invasion of Poland started on 1 September 1939.|$|E
5|$|Gilmore had {{suspected}} that C. fragilis and C. agilis were the same, but Ostrom {{was able to}} demonstrate this synonymy. This greatly expanded the known material pertaining to C. fragilis, and Ostrom was able to demonstrate that Ornitholestes was quite different from Coelurus. At the time, Dale Russell had proposed that C. agilis was a species of Elaphrosaurus based on the incomplete information then published; Ostrom was also able to demonstrate {{that this was not}} the case. Additionally, he showed that one of the three vertebrae Marsh had illustrated for C. fragilis was actually a composite of two vertebrae, one of which was later shown to come from another quarry and belonged not to Coelurus but to another, unnamed small theropod. This unnamed genus would not be the last small theropod from the Morrison Formation to be confused with Coelurus; a later discovery (1995) of a partial skeleton in Wyoming was first thought to be a new larger specimen of Coelurus, but further study showed it belonged to a <b>different</b> <b>but</b> related genus, Tanycolagreus.|$|E

5|$|Rosemary Hennessy and Chrys Ingraham {{say that}} materialist forms of {{feminism}} {{grew out of}} Western Marxist thought and have inspired a number of <b>different</b> (<b>but</b> overlapping) movements, {{all of which are}} involved in a critique of capitalism and are focused on ideology's relationship to women. Marxist feminism argues that capitalism is the root cause of women's oppression, and that discrimination against women in domestic life and employment is an effect of capitalist ideologies. Socialist feminism distinguishes itself from Marxist feminism by arguing that women's liberation can only be achieved by working to end both the economic and cultural sources of women's oppression. Anarcha-feminists believe that class struggle and anarchy against the state require struggling against patriarchy, which comes from involuntary hierarchy.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{blackcap}} (Sylvia atricapilla) usually known {{simply as}} the blackcap, is a common and widespread typical warbler. It has mainly olive-grey upperparts and pale grey underparts, and differences between the five subspecies are small. Both sexes have a neat coloured cap to the head, black in the male and reddish-brown in the female. The male's typical song is a rich musical warbling, often ending in a loud high-pitched crescendo, but a simpler song is given in some isolated areas, such as valleys in the Alps. The blackcap's closest relative is the garden warbler, which looks quite <b>different</b> <b>but</b> has a similar song.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} of the neutron by James Chadwick in 1932, followed by that of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938, and its theoretical explanation (and naming) by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch soon after, opened up {{the possibility of a}} controlled nuclear chain reaction with uranium. On 20 December 1941, soon after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor that brought the United States into World War II, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist Arthur H. Compton was placed in charge of the plutonium project, the objective of which was to produce reactors to convert uranium into plutonium, to find ways to chemically separate plutonium from the uranium, and ultimately to design and build an atomic bomb. This became the Manhattan Project. Although a successful reactor had not yet been built, the scientists had already produced several <b>different</b> <b>but</b> promising design concepts.|$|E

5|$|The three {{principal}} {{cities of}} the Bay Area represent different employment clusters and are dominated by <b>different,</b> <b>but</b> commingled, industries. San Francisco {{is home to the}} region's financial and business industry, tourism, and is host to numerous conventions. The East Bay, centered around Oakland, is home to heavy industry, metalworking, oil, and shipping, while Silicon Valley is a major pole of economic activity around the technology industry. Furthermore, the North Bay is {{a major player in the}} country's agriculture and wine industry. In all, the Bay Area is home to the second highest concentration of Fortune 500 companies, second only to the New York metropolitan area, with thirty such companies based throughout the region. In 2014, the greater twelve-county statistical area had a GDP of $758.5 billion, the third-highest among combined statistical areas. The smaller nine-county Bay Area had a GDP of $721 billion, which nonetheless would rank it 6th among U.S. states and 16th among countries.|$|E
5|$|Xinhua News Agency {{published}} an article on 17 January 2016 stating that an individual {{by the name of}} Gui Minhai had been detained relating to a fatal traffic accident in December 2003 in which a schoolgirl died.

The two discrepancies created doubts {{that there may have been}} a case of mistaken identity. Xinhua claimed that Gui gave himself up to public security officials in October 2015.|$|E
5|$|In 1860, {{just prior}} to the {{outbreak}} of the American Civil War, a group of people in the southern portion of New Mexico Territory passed a resolution condemning the United States for creating such a vast territory with only a single, small government in place at Santa Fe. They claimed by doing so the U.S. had ignored the needs of the southern portion, left them without a functional system of law and order, and allowed the situation to deteriorate into a state of chaos and near anarchy. The group declared secession from the United States and announced their intent to join the Confederate States of America under the name of the Arizona Territory. The U.S. Congress responded in 1863 by creating another Arizona Territory with <b>different,</b> <b>but</b> partially overlapping boundaries. The Confederate boundaries split New Mexico along an east–west line, the 34th parallel north, allowing for a single state connection from Texas to the Colorado River. This would give the Confederacy access to California and the Pacific coast. The Union definition split New Mexico along a north–south line, the 32nd meridian west from Washington, which simply extended the boundary between Colorado and Utah southward. The Union plan eventually became reality, and this created the quadripoint at the modern Four Corners. After the split, New Mexico resembled its modern form, with only slight differences.|$|E
