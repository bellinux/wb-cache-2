30|$|On present-day Mars, it is {{believed}} that stagnant-lid convection is dominant and that convection occurs only beneath the thick, rigid, and immobile lithosphere (e.g., Solomatov and Moresi 1997). Although plate tectonics {{does not appear to have}} occurred on present-day Mars, previous studies have discussed whether plate-like tectonics have occurred on Mars in the past (e.g., Sleep 1994; Connerney et al. 1999; Schubert et al. 2001; Breuer and Spohn 2003). Importantly, the initiation of plate tectonics requires moderate lithospheric thickness and faulting on a sufficient scale to <b>form</b> <b>plate</b> boundaries (e.g., Nimmo and McKenzie 1998; Tackley 1998, 2000); therefore, the lithosphere must have moderate strength (≤ 200 – 300  MPa) for plate tectonics to occur. In this section, we discuss the time evolution of the lithospheric thickness and strength on Mars.|$|E

Binder-free electrocatalytic electrode becomes a possible solution to the above problem. Binder-free bimetallic Pd-Pt loaded graphene aerogel on nickel foam plates with different Pd/Pt ratios (1 : 2. 32, 1 : 1. 62, and 1 : 0. 98) are successfully fabricated through a green one-step mild reduction process producing a Pd-Pt/GO/nickel <b>form</b> <b>plate</b> (NFP) composite. Anode with the binder-free electrocatalysts exhibit a strong activity in a batch type DGFC unit under room temperature. The effects of glucose and KOH concentrations, and the Pd/Pt ratios of the electrocatalyst on the DGFC performance are also studied. Maximum power density output of 1. 25 mW cm- 2 is recorded with 0. 5 M glucose/ 3 M KOH as the anodic fuel, and Pd 1 Pt 0. 98 /GA/NFP as catalyst, which is the highest obtained so far among other types of electrocatalyst...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} effects of {{asymmetric}} creep-ageing behaviour on springback of aluminium alloys during creep age forming (CAF) process. An Al-Cu-Li alloy, AA 2050, which shows an apparent asymmetric tension and compression creep-ageing behaviour is used for investigation. Several CAF trial tests to form singly-curved AA 2050 plates with different thicknesses (3, 5 and 8 mm) are carried out with a four point bending setup. Meanwhile, two sets of finite element (FE) models of corresponding processes have been developed, in which either the conventional symmetric or the new asymmetric creep-ageing behaviour of the alloy was used. The asymmetric models can well predict the shape of <b>formed</b> <b>plates</b> for thicker materials (5 and 8 mm), while symmetric models provide over-prediction of final deflections. The results from asymmetric models indicate that more creep strain is generated in the tension stressed part of the <b>forming</b> <b>plate</b> than that in the other part with compressive stresses and therefore, resulting in an asymmetric distribution of the relaxed stresses through {{the thickness of the}} <b>forming</b> <b>plates</b> after creep-ageing. After springback, both top and bottom surfaces of the <b>formed</b> <b>plates</b> show significant compressive stresses while tensile residual stresses exist in the centre of the <b>formed</b> <b>plates.</b> The work in this study helps to understand the particular springback behaviour of AA 2050 with asymmetric creep-ageing behaviour in CAF, and can be used to guide future industrial applications of the alloy in the CAF process...|$|R

Definition: Printing {{is the art}} of taking an impression from an inked <b>form,</b> <b>plate,</b> block or stone. 2. Branches: There are several distinct branches of this important art, and each branch is, practically, a separate art, distinct from its rivals in its theory, its processes, and its applications. These methods are: (a) Steel-plate and Copper-plate Printing, in which the subject is printed from an etching or engraving below the surface of a plate of steel or copper. (b) Lithography, in which the subject is printed from a transferred engraving on the surface of a prepared stone. (c) Xylography, in which the subject is printed from a design engraved on a block of wood in high relief. (d) Typography, in which the subject is printed from a combination of movable metal types cast in high relief. The arts of lithography and copper-plate are useful and beautiful methods of printing, but they do not make books and newspapers. The necessity which compels the making of a new engraving for every new subject restricts them almost exclusively to the field of art and ornament. If no other method of printing were known, encyclopedias and newspapers would be impossibilities. "The art preservative of all arts" is not the art of lithography nor of copper-plate. This distinction rightfully belongs to typography only...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{the authors}} {{described}} the hereditary {{behaviors of the}} Toyama 2 ̆ 7 s grey egg (Toyama, 1912, 1913) and the collapsing egg (Sado, 1957), phase-contrast microscopic observations of the surfaces and cross-sections of these abnormal egg shells, and the comparative examination {{of the separation of}} the components both of the collapsing and the normal eggs by centrifugation. Then some problems were discussed about the genic actions of these two and other grey egg genes and the complex nature of the Gr multiple allelic locus. 1. Toyama 2 ̆ 7 s grey egg in the silkworm. e 6 stock in our laboratory, manifests phenotypically following characteristics; the shell of which is opaque and milky white in color, the egg looking grey due to optical combination with the dark serosa pigments, the surface of the shell is not smooth but become irregularly corrugated when the ventral plate is formed, there is no depression in the egg surface and further, as to the shape, it shows slightly spindle <b>form</b> (<b>Plate</b> 21 - 1). Genetically, however, these characters are controlled by a single dominant gene, Gr (Tanaka, 1943). Gr heterozygous female moth deposits grey eggs, while Gr homozygous one B-grey eggs which are phenotypically significantly different from the grey eggs, and the shells of which are thin and translucent, manifesting normal dark egg colors, but as to the shape,they resemble to those of grey egg (Plate 21. 3). Accordingly, in order to obtain moths depositting grey eggs we have only to cross normal egged breed with B-grey one. Recombination values between p, Gr and Y genes calculated after three points experiments were p-Gr= 6. 5, Gr-Y= 18. 9 and p-Y= 25. 4, which coincide with those of Tanaka (1943). 2. Collapsing egg was for the first time found by the senior author (1957) as a spontaneous mutation in the p 22 stock (Normal egged breed; Japanese race, Yamato-Nishiki). It shows evidently spindle shape immediately after deposition, but in about half an hour after oviposition it becomes completely depressed to the bottom (Plate 21. 6 - 7). This character is completely recessive to the normal egg, and is controlled by a single recessive collapsing egg gene, symbolized as Gr^col Recombination values between p-Grc°t-Y loci after three points tests are p-Gr^col= 5. 3, Gr^col-Y= 21. 5 and p-Y= 26. 4, respectively. As in the chromosome map of the silkworm so far established map distance between p and Y loci is 25. 6 units, we must correct the values described above, and get p-Gr^col= 5. 1. This coincides with the Gr- 16 locus determined by Takasaki (1947). 3. Gr/Gr^col female moth produces new type variant eggs, owing to the interaction between Gr and Gr^col genes. This variant egg shows phenotypically intermediate between Gr/Gr and Gr/＋, that is, the shell of which is partially translucent and the surrounding part of it shows milky white color, and the shape of which resembles to those of B-grey or grey eggs. 4. In order to test the pseudoallelic relation between Gr and Gr^col genes, the authors tested the Gr/Gr^col sib-mating with p^ 3 - and Y-markers on the second chromosome : the result shows that recombination does not occur, because moths depositting B-grey, variant and collapsing eggs segregated with 1 : 2 : 1 ratio (see Table 7). 5. Separation of the components of the collapsing and the normal eggs by centrifugation (14, 500 g, 40 min.) shows no significant difference. The reason for collapsing is, therefore, attributed not to the lack or reduction of any components in the egg, btit to the structural abnormality of the egg shell. 6. Phase-contrast microscopic observations of surfaces and cross-sections of the egg shells are carried out on various genic combinations (Gr/Gr, Gr/＋, Gr/Gr^col, Gr^col/Gr^col and ＋/＋). The surfaces of abnormal eggs are common in the irregularities of the patterns which were copied when the exochorion had been secreted and further, in the cross-sections significant differences in the thickness of the shells and irregularities of the outer- and mid-layer structure are seen (Plate 22. 1 - 5). From these investigations as well as informations about grey eggs up to present, it is postulated as follows : I. The egg shape is determined by the pattern of the form and arrangement of follicle cells at the ovarian differentiation and the chorion substance is secreted by them. Then, it is expected that the shape of the egg as well as the physiological function of the follicle cells become abnormal as described above, if the Gr or Gr^col genes begin to act at relatively early stages of ovarian development, before the determination of the pattern of follicle cells. On the contrary, in other grey eggs with no abnormalities in shapes, the genes causing these characters are possibly not at work until the pattern of follicle cells is determined. Such a relationship between the time of genic action and the resulting characreristics is very interesting from the developmental point of view. II. In the case of Toyama 2 ̆ 7 s grey egg, phenotypic difference between the eggs laid by Gr homozygous and heterozygous female is explained as an example of socalled incomplete dominance of genic action for chorion formation. And this is also the cases of Kei 2 ̆ 7 s grey egg, Grk (Kei, 1937, 1943), and White side egg, Se (Kei, 1933, 1937, 1943). III. Although the authors could not find out the pseudoallelic relation between Gr and Gr^col genes, there remains a possibility that Gr multiple allelic series including Gr, Grk, Gr- 16 and Gr^col (and possibly Grl, Gr- 1, Gr- 2, Gr- 6) genes may constitute a complex nature of the locus. Because, it seems, from the developmental {{point of view of the}} genic action of these multiple allelic genes, that there are at least two groups : one is characterized by the abnormalities of the egg shape as well as chorion formation, and the other only by the chorion formation. 1) 外山灰色卵について著者等が先に与えたSpなる遺伝子記号は田中博士のGrと同一のものであることを確認し, 従来灰色卵の遺伝について不充分であつた点や混乱を指摘した.

A test programme is presented which describes the material and workpiece information and the test plans for the experimental evaluation of the creep-ageing and springback behaviour of aluminium alloy 7 B 04 -T 651 under 115 oC. Experimental results from the creep-ageing and tensile tests {{were used to determine}} a CAF material model for the alloy. A flexible tool design has been proposed and a laboratory-scale prototype has been delivered and used to perform the CAF tests in this research.

Comparisons between final deflections of FE-simulated and experimentally <b>formed</b> <b>plates</b> validated the springback predictive ability of the FE process model.
