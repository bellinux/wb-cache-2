40|$|Over {{the last}} two years, serious {{concerns}} have been expressed in the press about human exposures to trace amounts of alkyl tin moieties such as tributyltin (TBT). Organostannic compounds are commonly used as catalysts in polyurethane chemistry. Whereas stannous octoate (SNOCT) exhibits a TBT content below the detection limit of most analysis equipment (< 0. 01 %, TBT levels as high as 0. 6 % have been measured in dibutyltin dilaurate (DBTDL). Although DBTDL manufacturers are currently optimising their process to lower the TBT content in DBTDL, the (chemo) pressure exerted on polyurethane <b>foamers</b> is such that DBTDL-free formulations are being actively looked for. High resilience (HR) foams based on various polymer polyols - particularly polyols made with pure polystyrene (POSTech*) or poly(styrene-acrylonitrile) have been developed using DBTDL as the gel catalyst. The direct replacement of DBTDL is not straightforward, as foam block dimensional stability issues (often referred to as "cold flow") are encountered when other catalyst (i. e., SNOCT) are used. This "cold flow" phenomenon is very much dependent on the size {{and the weight of}} the foam block produced, making all small scale laboratory experiments unsuitable for developing novel stable HR foam formulations. The present research has shown that properties derived from small scale experiments can nevertheless be related to the "cold flowability" of HR formulations. Amongst the various tests investigated, the variation in sag factor from top to bottom of the foam block was found to be the most relevant test method to assess the dimensional stability. Sag factor is here defined as the force exerted by the foam compressed to 65 % of the original thickness divided by that exerted at 25 % compression during the compression load deflection (CLD) test. The test method based on this variation in sag factor through the foam block (vSag) made possible the laboratory examination of formulation parameters for their impact on foam block stability. It also allowed us to develop a wide density range of POSTech-based DBTDL-free HR slabstock foams that are dimensionally stable...|$|R
40|$|Foams can do {{more than}} soften a beard or {{extinguish}} a fire. Foam also offers the oil industry better mobility control. The presence of a foaming agent in porous rocks can reduce the mobility of gas and water, stabilize the gas injection front and prevent unwanted production of gas and water. These unique properties can assist the reservoir engineer in different optimization processes to enhance oil recovery (EOR) and improve the economics of mature oil fields. A number of factors influence the properties of foam, such as the foaming agent, gas type, rock properties, interactions with oil, injection strategies, and temperature and pressure conditions. A change in one or several of these parameters may affect the performance of the foam and, consequently, the success of the intended foam application. For that reason, {{it is important to understand}} foam on a broad experimental scale. This thesis presents experimental studies of foam in bulk and porous media. The studies in porous media investigated: I) CO 2 -foam properties compared with those of N 2 - foams and II) the impact of rock material on foam generation performance and mobility control. The experiments were performed in oil-free outcrop sandstone core samples in the range of 30 - 280 bar and 50 - 100 °C using alpha-olefin sulfonate (AOSC 14 -C 16) surfactant. The studies in bulk evaluated a set of foaming agents relative to: I) various experimental methods (bulk tests, core flooding), II) different gas types (CO 2, N 2, air) and III) the absence and presence of oils (crude oils, alkanes). A new bulk test was designed in the thesis to allow foams with gases other than air to be studied under low pressure. The combination of several experimental approaches was introduced to improve the evaluation and screening of surfactants. The experimental results obtained in this thesis show that the presence of different gas types (CO 2, N 2) strongly influences the properties of foam in bulk and in porous media. The CO 2 -foams were inherently weaker than the N 2 -foams. Possible reasons for the apparent weakness of the CO 2 -foam compared with the N 2 -foam were investigated more closely. A good correlation between the CO 2 -density and the CO 2 -foam strength was found; conditions where the density of CO 2 is low improved the CO 2 -foam strength. Also, new foam experiments with pre-equilibrated fluids were conducted. These experiments suggested that the kinetics of the mass transfer between CO 2 and the surfactant solution could not be the main cause why the CO 2 -foams were weaker than the N 2 -foams. However, the use of preequilibrated fluids significantly improved the water-blocking capabilities of the CO 2 -foams, indicating that gas dissolution into the injected water is one of the predominant mechanisms that weaken the CO 2 -foams during liquid injection following generation. N 2 -foam experiments in various outcrop sandstone core samples showed that the rock material is one of the main parameters controlling the in-situ foam generation performance. The results demonstrated that foam was able to be generated and reduce mobility in all the sandstone cores used under all the conditions listed above. However, large variations in foam strength and mobility control were obtained between the different core samples. The presence of low permeability laminated heterogeneities, detected through various types of core analysis, appeared to be one of the parameters affecting the foam generation performance. The detailed interactions between the rock surface properties and the thin liquid films were beyond the scope of this thesis, but are suggested to be of central importance to in-situ foam generation performance. The combination of several experimental techniques, including the new bulk test, was shown to be valuable for improving the evaluation and screening of <b>foamers</b> in the absence and presence of oil. Although certain similarities and interesting trends were observed between the experiments in bulk and porous media, the bulk foam properties of this work did not generally correlate with the foam properties in porous media. It seems difficult to predict foam properties and performance separate from the porous media by means of simpler experimental methods. It is hoped that the laboratory-derived results presented in this dissertation will contribute to generate new insights and ideas within the field of foam, provide valuable input to reservoir models and simulations, and suggest practical considerations towards the scaling of foam processes for different EOR applications. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{several key}} {{issues in the}} design of foam for mobility control in alkaline-surfactant enhanced oil recovery processes. First, foam flow in fracture systems was studied. A theory for foam flow in a uniform fracture was developed and verified by experiment. The apparent viscosity was found to be the sum of contributions arising from liquid between bubbles and the resistance to deformation of the interfaces of bubbles passing through the fracture. Apparent viscosity increases with gas fractional flow and is greater for thicker fractures (for a given bubble size), indicating that foam can divert flow from thicker to thinner fractures. The diversion effect was confirmed experimentally and modeled using the above theory for individual fractures. The amount of surfactant solution required to sweep a heterogeneous fracture system decreases greatly with increasing gas fractional flow owing to the diversion effect and to the need for less liquid to occupy a given volume when foam is used. The sweep efficiency's sensitivity to bubble size was investigated theoretically in a heterogeneous fracture system with log-normal distributed apertures. Second, the foam application in forced convection of alkaline-surfactant enhanced oil recovery processes was studied. From sand pack experiments for the alkaline-surfactant-polymer process, a 0. 3 PV slug of the surfactant blend studied can recover almost all the waterflood residual crude oil when followed by a polymer solution as mobility control agent. But this blend is a weak <b>foamer</b> near its optimum salinity while one of its components, IOS, is a good <b>foamer.</b> Two types of processes were tested in sand packs to study possible process improvements and cost savings from replacing some polymer by foam for mobility control. The first used IOS foam as drive after the surfactant slug, while the second, which is preferred, involved injecting gas with the surfactant slug containing polymer followed by IOS foam. It was found that foam has higher apparent viscosity in high than in low permeability region. Thus, use of foam should be more attractive in heterogeneous system to get better sweep efficiency...|$|E
40|$|Foam {{assisted}} lift is a deliquification {{method in}} {{the oil and gas}} industry, which aims to prevent or postpone countercurrent gas-liquid flow in maturing gas wells or to assist in removing downhole accumulated liquids. According to Nimwegen, who performed experiments with foam flows, foam accomplishes this, since the creation of foam postpones the transition from annular to churn flow to lower gas velocities, which improves the upward transport of liquid carried by foam. This paper presents a model predicting the foam flow behaviour in annular flow conditions down to the transition from annular to churn flow. The model treats the foam flow as a film flow, similar to that described by, e. g., Hewitt.

40|$|Economic, environmental, and {{engineering}} benefits have motivated {{the implementation of}} warm mix asphalt (WMA) in the United States. While asphalt foaming {{has become the most}} popular method for producing WMA, concerns remain about the performance of foamed asphalt mixtures due to the use of water in the foaming process. Along with the advent of WMA, recent changes in asphalt mixture components and production parameters have raised the need to review the current design practices and evaluation methods for asphalt mixtures, including the effects of aging. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to evaluate the aging characteristics of asphalt mixtures and to explore asphalt foaming technology for WMA applications. Aging of asphalt mixtures occurs during production and construction and continues throughout the service life of pavements. In this study, laboratory short-term aging protocols were evaluated in terms of simulating the asphalt aging and aggregate absorption that occurs during plant production and pavement construction. In addition, the concepts of cumulative degree-days and mixture property ratios were proposed to quantify field aging and to explore its correlation with laboratory long-term aging protocols in terms of mixture properties. Furthermore, the effects of various mixture components and production parameters on the aging characteristics of asphalt mixtures were investigated. Finally, post-construction cores obtained from several field projects were measured to explore mixture stiffness and binder property gradients in order to characterize the non-uniform field aging of asphalt pavements with depth. Asphalt foaming technology was also explored in this study via a comprehensive laboratory experiment. A non-contact test method consisting of a laser device and a digital camera was developed to measure the asphalt foaming process in terms of volume expansion and collapse and evolution of asphalt foam bubbles. In addition, novel test methods were proposed to evaluate the workability and coatability for foamed asphalt mixtures. The proposed test methods were then utilized to investigate the effects of foaming water content and laboratory <b>foamer</b> type on asphalt foaming characteristics and foamed mixture properties. Finally, a mix design procedure for foamed asphalt mixtures was proposed and validated with field and laboratory data...|$|E
