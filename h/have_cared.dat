5|$|On 5 May 2016, James Reilly, then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, {{announced}} that the Irish Government had approved {{the publication of the}} Adoption (Amendment) Bill 2016. The bill would amend the Adoption Act 2010 and the Children and Family Relationships Act 2015 and give legislative effect to the Thirty-first Amendment of the Constitution of Ireland (the children referendum). The purposes of the bill are to allow children to be adopted by their foster carers, where they <b>have</b> <b>cared</b> for the child for at least 18 months, and to allow two people regardless of marital status to adopt children, thus granting married same-sex couples the right to adopt. The bill also allows for the adoption of a child by civil partners and cohabiting couples and gives children a greater say in the adoption process, among many other reforms to the adoption system. The bill passed the Dáil on 30 November 2016, and received approval by the Seanad on 13 June 2017. The bill was signed into law by President Michael D. Higgins on 19 July 2017, becoming the Adoption (Amendment) Act 2017. The commencement order was signed by the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Katherine Zappone, on 18 October and the law went into effect the following day.|$|E

25|$|In 2011, {{a nest of}} 15 young Protoceratops andrewsi was {{discovered}} in Mongolia. Stated as being the first Protoceratops nest discovered to date, the discovery suggests that Protoceratops parents might <b>have</b> <b>cared</b> for their young at nests during at least {{the early stages of}} childhood. As Protoceratops is a relatively basal member of the ceratopsians, the finding also suggests that other ceratopsians provided care for their young as well.|$|E

25|$|At school, {{as well as}} in church, Francisco's claimed paranormal power {{constantly}} {{would put}} him into trouble. Once, while in his fourth year of primary school, he claimed to have seen a man who had dictated all his school essays, but no one seemed to have given him any credits; and not even the teacher seemed to <b>have</b> <b>cared</b> about it. One of his memorial school compositions on the centenary of the independence of Brazil won an honorable mention in a state contest. In 1922 he faced skepticism from colleagues and friends, who accused him of plagiarism, such accusation lasted all his life. Challenged to prove his gifts, Francisco was submitted to the challenge of improvising an essay (with the help of a spirit) about sand grain, the topic was chosen at that very moment, in which, he succeeded.|$|E
25|$|It {{has been}} argued whether Anselm's {{reluctance}} to take the see was sincere or not. Scholars such as Southern and Kent maintain Anselm's honest preference was to remain at Bec. Anselm had initially considered becoming a hermit and, naturally drawn to contemplation, he likely would <b>have</b> <b>cared</b> little for such a political office {{at the best of}} times and disliked it all the more amid his own troubled age. Against this, Vaughn notes that feigned reluctance to accept important positions was a common practice within the medieval church, as open eagerness risked earning a reputation as an ambitious careerist. She further notes that his approach improved his negotiating position and that he finally acted at the moment that gained him the greatest leverage in advancing the interests of his see and the reform movement within the church.|$|E
25|$|A {{juvenile}} Chasmosaurus belli {{found in}} Alberta, Canada by Phil Currie et al., reveals that Chasmosaurus may <b>have</b> <b>cared</b> for its young, like its relative, Triceratops, is hypothesized to have done. The juvenile measured five {{feet long and}} {{was estimated to be}} three years of age and had similar limb and frill proportions to the adult Chasmosaurus. This indicates that Chasmosaurus was not fast moving, and that juveniles {{did not need to be}} fast moving either to keep pace with adults. The fossil was complete save for its missing front limbs, which had fallen into a sinkhole before the specimen was uncovered. Skin impressions were also uncovered beneath the skeleton and evidence from the matrix that it was buried in indicated that the juvenile ceratopsian drowned during a possible river crossing. Further study of the specimen revealed that juvenile chasmosaurs had a frill that was narrower in the back than that of adults, as well as being proportionately shorter in relation to the skull.|$|E

25|$|The fact of {{the embassy}} cannot be doubted. The {{distinguished}} ambassadors visited the Hun's camp near the south shore of Lake Garda. It is also certain that Attila suddenly retreated. But {{we are at a}} loss to know what considerations were offered him to induce him to depart. It is unreasonable to suppose that this heathen king would <b>have</b> <b>cared</b> for the thunders or persuasions of the Church. The Emperor refused to surrender Honoria, and it is not recorded that money was paid. A trustworthy chronicle hands down another account which does not conflict with the fact that an embassy was sent, but evidently furnishes the true reasons which moved Attila to receive it favourably. Plague broke out in the barbarian host and their food ran short, {{and at the same time}} troops arrived from the east, sent by Marcian to the aid of Italy. If his host was suffering from pestilence, and if troops arrived from the east, we can understand that Attila was forced to withdraw. But whatever terms were arranged, he did not pretend that they meant a permanent peace. The question of Honoria was left unsettled, and he threatened that he would come again and do worse things in Italy unless she were given up with the due portion of the Imperial possessions.|$|E
500|$|Although Massospondylus {{was long}} {{depicted}} as quadrupedal, a 2007 study {{found it to}} be bipedal. It was probably a plant eater (herbivore), although it is speculated that the early sauropodomorphs may have been omnivorous. This animal, which was [...] long, had a long neck and tail, with a small head and slender body. On each of its forefeet, it bore a sharp thumb claw that was used in defense or feeding. Recent studies indicate that Massospondylus grew steadily throughout its lifespan, possessed air sacs similar to those of birds, and may <b>have</b> <b>cared</b> for its young.|$|E
500|$|Many years later, {{another of}} his followers, Virginia Downsborough, {{recalled}} that during the mid-1960s he [...] "talked a lot about Sara Northrup and {{seemed to want to}} make sure that I knew he had never married her. I didn't know why it was so important to him; I'd never met Sara and I couldn't <b>have</b> <b>cared</b> less, but he wanted to persuade me that the marriage had never taken place. When he talked about his first wife, the picture he put out of himself was of this poor wounded fellow coming home from the war and being abandoned by his wife and family because he would be a drain on them." [...] As Downsborough put it, he portrayed himself as [...] "a constant victim of women".|$|E

500|$|Alan Sepinwall of The Star-Ledger {{found that}} while 90210 was neither [...] "trainwreck nor masterpiece", it {{remained}} remarkably faithful in tone and spirit to the original series. The reviewer realized that [...] "the dialogue was at times intentionally funny", and pointed out that although the actors looked to old for high school, they acted [...] "a lot more natural" [...] than the actors on the original series. Sepinwall questioned The CW's intended audience, saying that while the music and styles were reminiscent of Gossip Girl, {{those who had not}} seen the original series would not <b>have</b> <b>cared</b> for the returning characters. Verne Gay of Newsday described 90210 as a [...] "perfectly competent and reasonably seamless revival", with enough contemporary touchstones to attract new viewers. The reviewer commended the spin-off for integrating the new characters with the originals, while also including adults. Gay {{found that while}} the pilot featured too many story lines, the [...] "vibe felt right" [...] and it was not the disaster it was expected to be.|$|E

40|$|This {{qualitative}} study was informed by grounded theory and data were gathered primarily through semi-structured in-depth interviews with thirty-seven theoretically sampled former carers. They were all white British, {{lived in the}} East Midlands and were predominately over sixty (68 per cent) and female (70 per cent). With the exception of one, all <b>had</b> <b>cared</b> for a close relative, 65 per cent <b>having</b> <b>cared</b> for a partner/spouse. Most of their dependants were older adults and each case the cessation of <b>caring</b> <b>had</b> coincided {{with the death of}} the dependant. The findings showed that post-caring life for the interviewees had an identifiable trajectory with three phases—the ‘post-caring void’, ‘closing down “the caring time” and ‘constructing life post-caring’. Each of these phases involved a distinct set of experiences. In addition, the study established that 70 per cent of those in the sample <b>had</b> <b>cared</b> more than once. Thus, two new concepts—’the post-caring trajectory’ and the ‘serial carer’— were developed to reflect these findings. Suggestions are made about ways in which policy, practice and further research can be developed in order to ensure there is effective provision for those who <b>have</b> ceased <b>caring...</b>|$|R

2500|$|Although {{social work}} has been {{historically}} defined by these institutionalized and deinstitutionalized periods, informal community design programs have always existed. In fact, informal community-based programs predate human service applications of this approach. In 1990, Bernice Harper illustrated {{this point in the}} book Social Work Practice with Black Families: A Culturally Specific Perspective in regards to African American communities, by writing that: Blacks have always cared for the sick at home, yet it was never labeled 'home care.' Blacks have been dying at home and receiving care in the process, yet it was never called 'hospice care.' Blacks have relieved each other from the caring and curing processes, yet it was never seen as 'respite care.' Blacks <b>have</b> <b>cared</b> for each other in their homes, in their neighborhoods, and throughout their communities, yet it was never referred to as 'volunteerism.' ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{introduction}} {{into the}} Eisenstadt School of modern methods {{of education and}} of secular learning was resented by the Orthodox. (Hildesheimer's [...] "liberal tendencies and sympathy with modern culture" [...] soon changed this resentment [...] "to positive antipathy".) Eventually his Yeshiva was denounced before {{the representatives of the}} government at Oedenburg, the result being that the Hungarian government ordered the school closed within twenty-four hours and the pupils removed from the city. Soon afterward, however (1858), Hildesheimer succeeded in obtaining state recognition for the Yeshiva. Interestingly, the Yeshiva also had opponents on the left: Reform saw it as a threat because its graduates would be equipped to defend Orthodoxy against Reform's inroads. In 1860, the zealot Akiva Yosef Schlesinger placed Hildesheimer under a ban as [...] "not truly a sincere Jew" [...] ("emessdiger Jüd"). [...] Hildesheimer, however, seems to <b>have</b> <b>cared</b> little for the ban.|$|E

2500|$|Jemison {{resigned}} from NASA in March 1993. [...] "I left NASA because I'm {{very interested in}} how social sciences interact with technologies," [...] Jemison said. [...] "People always think of technology as something having silicon in it. But a pencil is technology. Any language is technology. Technology is a tool we use to accomplish a particular task and when one talks about appropriate technology in developing countries, appropriate may mean anything from fire to solar electricity." [...] NASA training manager and author Homer Hickam later expressed some regret that she had departed, saying, [...] "NASA had {{spent a lot of}} money training her; she also filled a niche, obviously, being a woman of color." [...] Hickam had trained Jemison for her flight on Spacelab-J/STS-47. In an interview with the Des Moines Register on October 16, 2008, Jemison said that she was not driven to be the [...] "first black woman to go into space."
