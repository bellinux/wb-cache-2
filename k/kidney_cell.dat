40|$|Fetal <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> {{may contain}} {{multiple}} populations of <b>kidney</b> stem <b>cells</b> and thus {{appear to be}} a suitable cellular therapy for the treatment of acute renal failure (ARF) but their biologi-cal characteristics and therapeutic potential have not been adequately explored. We have culture expanded fetal <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> derived from rat fetal kidneys, characterized them and evaluated their therapeutic effect in an ischemia reperfusion (IR) induced rat model of ARF. The fetal <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> grew in culture as adherent spindle shaped/polygonal cells and expressed CD 29, CD 44, CD 73, CD 90, CD 105, CD 24 and CD 133 markers. Administration of PKH 26 labeled fetal <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> in ARF rats resulted in a significant decrease in the lev-els of blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin and decreased tubular necrosis in the kidney tissues (p< 0. 05 for all). The injected fetal <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> were observed to engraft around injured tubular cells, and there was increased prolifer-ation and decreased apoptosis of tubular <b>cells</b> in the <b>kidneys</b> (p< 0. 05 for both). In addition, the kidney tissues of ARF rats treated with fetal <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> had a higher gene expression of renotropic growth factors (VEGF-A, IGF- 1, BMP- 7 and bFGF) and anti-inflammatory cyto-kine (IL 10); up regulation of anti-oxidative markers (HO- 1 and NQO- 1); and a lower Bax/ Bcl 2 ratio as compared to saline treated rats (p< 0. 05 for all). Our data shows that culture expanded fetal <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> express mesenchymal and renal progenitor markers, and ame-liorate ischemic ARF predominantly by their anti-apoptotic, anti-inflammatory and anti-oxi-dative effects...|$|R

40|$|The {{functional}} {{properties of the}} early antigens of simian virus 40 (SV 40) and human papovavirus BK (BKV) were investigated. Infection of African green monkey <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> with BKV permitted the bidirectional replication of an early temperature-sensitive mutant (tsA) at a nonpermissive temperature. Conceivably, an early gene product (T-antigen) of BKV can substitute functionally for the defective SV 40 T-antigen. On the other hand, SV 40 DNA replication remained undetectable in human embryonic <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> preinfected with BKV, suggesting that BKV early antigens alone are not sufficient {{to provide for the}} replication of SV 40. Preinfection of African green monkey <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> with BKV restored the normal pattern of late lytic SV 40 transcription, suppressing the overproduction of early RNA by an SV 40 tsA mutant at the nonpermissive temperature. Furthermore, preinfection of African green monkey <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> with BKV supported the growth of adenovirus type 2, providing a "helper function" similar to that provided by SV 40 for the growth of human adenovirus in monkey <b>kidney</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

40|$|Several {{studies have}} been {{reported}} on the comparative susceptibility of various cell cultures for the primary isolation of enteric viruses. The present report gives a comparison of human embryo <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> and rhesus monkey <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> for the primary isolation of viruses from faecal specimens. Altogether, 148 enteroviruses, covering 21 serotypes, and 20 adenoviruses were isolated. The marked sensitivity of human embryo <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> to adenoviruses was again demonstrated. These cells, however, {{were found to be}} significantly less sensitive than rhesus monkey cells for the isolation of the enteroviruses encountered. This finding is in conflict with the results of a previous study and is partly explained by the difference in enterovirus composition of the two series. The value of human embryo <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> for the primary isolation of enteric viruses would seem to be closely related to the prevalence of adenoviruses and certain coxsackievirus A serotypes in the population studied...|$|R
50|$|A novel {{possible}} use of GFP includes {{using it as}} a sensitive monitor of intracellular processes via an eGFP laser system made out of a human embryonic <b>kidney</b> <b>cell</b> line. The first engineered living laser is made by an eGFP expressing cell inside a reflective optical cavity and hitting it with pulses of blue light. At a certain pulse threshold, the eGFP's optical output becomes brighter and completely uniform in color of pure green with a wavelength of 516 nm. Before being emitted as laser light, the light bounces back and forth within the resonator cavity and passes the cell numerous times. By studying the changes in optical activity, researchers may better understand cellular processes.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} {{inherited}} diseases involve defects in carrier proteins {{in a particular}} substance or group of cells. Cysteinuria (cysteine in the urine and the bladder) is such a disease involving defective cysteine carrier proteins in the <b>kidney</b> <b>cell</b> membranes. This transport system normally removes cysteine from the fluid destined to become urine and returns this essential amino acid to the blood. When this carrier malfunctions, large quantities of cysteine remain in the urine, where it is relatively insoluble and tends to precipitate. This is one cause of urinary stones. Some vitamin carrier proteins {{have been shown to}} be overexpressed in patients with malignant disease. For example, levels of riboflavin carrier protein (RCP) {{have been shown to be}} significantly elevated in people with breast cancer.|$|E
5000|$|The G protein-coupled receptor, GPR31, cloned from PC3 human {{prostate}} cancer cell {{line is a}} high affinity (Kd=4.8 nM) receptor for 12(S)-HETE; GPR31 does not bind 12(R)-HETE and has relatively little affinity for 5(S)-HETE or 15(S)-HETE. [...] GPR31 mRNA is expressed at low levels in several human cell lines including K562 cells (human myelogenous leukemia cell line), Jurkat cells, (T lymphocye cell line), Hut78 cells (T cell lymphoma cell line), HEK 293 cells (primary embryonic <b>kidney</b> <b>cell</b> line), MCF7 cells (mammary adenocarcinoma cell line), and EJ cells (bladder carcinoma cell line).

40|$|Immunochemical {{study of}} a {{transforming}} growth factor-α-related protein in the chicken kidney. A number of polypeptides are involved in renal growth and physiology. Both transforming growth factor-α (TGF-α) protein and mRNA are expressed in <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> during embryonic and adult stages, and exert mitogenic activity on <b>kidney</b> <b>cells</b> in culture. We studied the immunolocalization of a TGF-α-related protein at the ultrastructural level and {{found it in the}} basolateral membranes of dark cells from distal tubules of the chicken kidney. By Western blotting techniques, we identified a protein complex composed of at least two TGF-α immunoreactive subunits of 40 and 88 kDa, respectively. Both subunits were sensitive to elastase digestion, and released TGF-α immunoreactive products. In addition, TGF-α immunoreaction was found in primary culture of chicken <b>kidney</b> <b>cells.</b> These findings suggest that the TGF-α-related protein complex plays a very specific role in proliferation and/or differentiation of <b>kidney</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

50|$|Levomethadone is a μ-opioid {{receptor}} agonist with higher intrinsic activity than morphine, but lower affinity. Dextromethadone {{does not affect}} opioid receptors but binds to the glutamatergic NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor, and thus acts as a receptor antagonist against glutamate. Methadone {{has been shown to}} reduce neuropathic pain in rat models, primarily through NMDA antagonism. Glutamate is the primary excitatory neurotransmitter in the CNS. NMDA receptors have a very important role in modulating long-term excitation and memory formation. NMDA antagonists such as dextromethorphan (DXM), ketamine (a dissociative anaesthetic, also M.O.A+.), tiletamine (a veterinary anaesthetic) and ibogaine (from the African tree Tabernanthe iboga, also M.O.A+.) are being studied for their role in decreasing the development of tolerance to opioids and as possible for eliminating addiction/tolerance/withdrawal, possibly by disrupting memory circuitry. Acting as an NMDA antagonist may be one mechanism by which methadone decreases craving for opioids and tolerance, and has been proposed as a possible mechanism for its distinguished efficacy regarding the treatment of neuropathic pain. The dextrorotary form (d-methadone) acts as an NMDA antagonist and is devoid of opioid activity: it has been shown to produce analgesia in experimental models of chronic pain. Methadone also acted as a potent, noncompetitive α3β4 neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine receptor antagonist in rat receptors, expressed in human embryonic <b>kidney</b> <b>cell</b> lines.|$|E
40|$|Oxidative stress {{has been}} implicated to {{contribute}} to HIV-induced <b>kidney</b> <b>cell</b> injury; however, the role of p 53, a modulator of oxidative stress, has not been evaluated {{in the development of}} HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN). We hypothesized that mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) may be critical for the induction of p 53 -mediated oxidative <b>kidney</b> <b>cell</b> injury in HIVAN. To test our hypothesis, we evaluated the effect of an mTOR inhibitor, rapamycin, on <b>kidney</b> <b>cell</b> p 53 expression, down stream signaling, and <b>kidney</b> <b>cell</b> injury in both in vivo and in vitro studies. Inhibition of the mTOR pathway resulted in downregulation of renal tissue p 53 expression, associated downstream signaling, and decreased number of sclerosed glomeruli, tubular microcysts, and apoptosed and 8 -hydroxy deoxyguanosine (8 -OHdG) -positive(+ve) cells in Tg 26 mice. mTOR inhibition not only attenuated <b>kidney</b> <b>cell</b> expression of p 66 ShcA and phospho-p 66 ShcA but also reactivated the redox-sensitive stress response program in the form of enhanced expression of manganese superoxide dismutase (MnSOD) and cata lase. In in vitro studies, the mTOR inhibitor also provided protection against HIV-induced podocyte apoptosis. Moreover, mTOR inhibition downregulated HIV-induced podocyte (HP/HIV) p 53 expression. Since HP/HIV silenced for mTOR displayed a lack of expression of p 53 as well as attenuated podocyte apoptosis, this suggests that mTOR is critical for <b>kidney</b> <b>cell</b> p 53 activation and associated oxidative <b>kidney</b> <b>cell</b> injury in the HIV milieu. © 2013 the American Physiological Society. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
