The Railway Ministry unsuccessfully attempted to cover up the details of the crash, but lingering public criticism led Prime Minister Wen Jiabao to visit the crash site shortly after the incident, where he promised a full, public government investigation and justice for those found responsible.

Therefore, a 3 contains fundamental (50 [*]Hz) current component. The 3 rdlevel, reconstructed signal (A 3) of individual phase current (A, B, C) are obtained from a 3 of the concerned phases {{at both ends of}} the substation.

It is characterized with a high sensitivity to incipient faults that cause unpredictable small changes in the process measurements. This work yields an analytical model based on the KL divergence to estimate the incipient fault magnitude in multivariate processes. In practice, the divergence has no closed form {{and it must be}} numerically approximated. In the particular case of incipient fault, the numerical approximation of the divergence causes many false alarms and missed detections because of the slight effect of the incipient fault. In this paper, the ability and relevance to estimate the incipient fault amplitude using the numerical divergence is studied.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to the detection and recognition of <b>faulty</b> audio <b>signalling</b> devices {{as part of an}} automated industrial manufacturing quality assurance process. The proposed system outperforms other well-established automated systems based on mel-frequency cepstrum coefficients (MFCC) and multi-layer perceptron (MLP). It uses both unlabelled sound data and labelled historical data acquired from human experts in detecting <b>faulty</b> <b>signalling</b> devices. The unlabelled data is used to train a deep neural network generative model to create multiple levels of hierarchical feature extractors which are used to train an MLP classifier, with the intent to model the human reasoning and judging processes in respect to sound classification. This paper presents the results of real world experiments based on data pertaining to the audio signalling quality assurance process for car instrument cluster manufacturing. These results show that the proposed system is able to successfully classify speakers into two groups: “Good” and “No good” depending on the part quality. The proposed system proves to be capable enough to eliminate the need for a manual inspection within the manufacturing process and is shown to be able to diagnose a fault {{with a high degree of}} accuracy. This work can be extended to other areas of automotive inspection where there is a need for a robust solution to sound detection and where an output signal is represented by a complex and changing frequency spectrum even with significant environmental nois...|$|R

40|$|This thesis proposes {{about the}} method for {{locating}} {{the source of}} ultrasonic signals and to detect {{the different types of}} partial discharges (PD) i. e. external and internal discharges on cable insulation. PD are the electric discharges in insulating material that does not bridge a pair of electrodes completely. The magnitude of PD is small, but, it can cause deterioration and may lead to brekdown. External PD was created by removing some of the portion of the insulation midway along the length of 5 meters RF Uniradio cable exposing the braid to the air. Internal PD was created by piercing small holes (0. 8, 1, 2 and 3 milimetres) on the middle layer of a threeparallel sheet of wacker silicone rubber so that it creates void at the inner part of the insulation. The external and internal PD test setup were subjected to a voltage supply of 5 kV to 20 kV in 2. 5 kV level increment, and lkV to 6 kV in lkV increment, respectively. The voltage is supplied to the test jigs from low voltage then increased gradually to observe the PD activity in the insulation. The voltage is stopped as the discharges becoming audible and the existence of the spark at the insulation started to occur. The emitted sounds of the external and internal PD are laudable to naked ears at 12. 5 kV and 5 kV respectively. The ultrasonic waves emitted by the PD detector by ultrasonic detector known as the Ultraprobe 2000, where it translate the ultrasonic signal into electrical signal and with the aid of signal converter, the signal can be recorded in the PC. These signals emitted from the discharges are known as <b>faulty</b> <b>signals.</b> The ultrasonic waves of the samples prior {{to the creation of the}} holes were also recorded in similar manner. These signals are known as healthy signals. The Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and Wavelet Analysis (WA) were employed for analysis. With FFT, the signals are represented in frequency-domain and the trend of signal the PD can be detected and be located. There are significant changes in FFT plots for <b>faulty</b> <b>signals</b> when comparing with the FFT plots for healthy signals. The peak magnitude lies on the low frequency range if the signal is healthy, meanwhile, if the <b>signal</b> is <b>faulty,</b> then the peak magnitude lies at the high frequency range. WA analyzes signal in time-domain in order to search for basic or commonly recurring pattern. Here, WA employed the dyadic down sampling technique in the analyses where the procedures taken in order to determine the suitable mother wavelet and its number of level. Each resulting signal produced from the dyadic is compared to the original signal. With different void sizes, it shows that the discharges at larger void size, the lower the peak frequency i. e 4 kV, just before the discharges become audible. It was found that these analyses are able to predict the patterns of <b>faulty</b> <b>signals</b> clearer than the original ultrasonic signals. For the case of external PD, it was found that the suitable mother wavelet is Daubechies at the number of level 7 (db 7). For internal PD, the best mother wavelet is Symlet with the number of level 3 (sym 3) ...|$|R
