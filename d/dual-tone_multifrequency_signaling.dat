Separate RTP payload formats are desirable since low-rate voice codecs cannot be guaranteed to reproduce these tone signals accurately enough for automatic recognition. Defining separate payload formats also permits higher redundancy while maintaining a low bit rate. The payload formats described here {{may be useful in}} at least three applications: DTMF handling for gateways and end sytems, as well as "RTP trunks". In the first application, the Internet telephony gateway detects DTMF on the incoming circuits and sends the RTP payload described here instead of regular audio packets.

A separate payload type is desirable since low-rate voice codecs cannot be guaranteed to accurately reproduce DTMF. Defining a separate payload type also permits higher redundancy {{while maintaining a}} low bit rate. The DTMF payload type must be suitable for both a gateway and end-to-end scenario. In the gateway scenario, a gateway connecting a packet voice network with the PSTN recreates the DTMF tones and injects them into the PSTN. Since DTMF digit recognition may take several tens of milliseconds, careful time and power (volume) alignment is needed to avoid generating spurious digits. For interactive voice response (IVR) systems directly connected to the packet voice network, time alignment and volume levels are not important, since the unit will not perform any signal analysis t [...] ...|$|R

This paper presents a hybrid signal processing and artificial intelligence based approach {{for the detection of}} <b>Dual-tone</b> <b>Multifrequency</b> (DTMF) tones under the influence of White Gaussian Noise (WGN) and frequency variation. Key innovations include the use of a Finite Impulse Response (FIR) bandpass filter for reduction of noise from DTMF input samples, and Support Vector Machines (SVM) for intelligent classification of the detected DTMF carrier frequencies. The proposed hybrid DTMF detector scheme is based on power spectrum analysis by means of the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT). The Goertzel’s Algorithm is used to estimate the seven fundamental DTMF carrier frequencies. The tone detection scheme employs decision logic to detect valid DTMF tones from low and high DTMF frequency groups.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages [119]- 122) Three {{digital signal}} processing (DSP) techniques for telecommunication systems are presented in this thesis. First, a single-channel speech enhancement technique using spectral subtraction algorithm is presented. This method suppresses the noise in speech by subtracting the estimated noise spectrum from the noisy speech. Computer simulations and real-time experiments on the TMS 320 C 50 system are presented to show that this algorithm achieves good speech enhancement in both white noise and periodic noise cases. Second, a dual-channel acoustic noise and echo cancellation microphone (ANECM) system is developed for hands-free telephone system. In the traditional adaptive noise canceling (ANC) and acoustic echo cancellation (AEC) systems, a very high order finite impulse response (FIR) filter is required to achieve satisfactory performance. However, high order filter results in high cost, slow convergence, high excess mean-square error, and numerical error. In the unique structure of ANECM system, two low order filters are required to cancel the noise and echo. A comparison of system performance shows that the new ANECM system has a better overall performance than the traditional AEC and ANC systems. Finally, a <b>dual-tone</b> <b>multifrequency</b> (DTMF) receiver implemented on the TMS 320 C 50 system is presented. With a modified Goertzel algorithm, the energies of the received signal at eight DTMF frequencies are efficiently computed. Five system tests are performed to determined whether a valid DTMF tone pair has been received. Real-time experiments are conducted to evaluate the system performance with the noise and speech signal present.

The detection of the single-frequency weak signals by using stochastic resonance effect is widely used. However, the detection methods of the <b>multifrequency</b> weak <b>signals</b> need to be researched. According to the different frequency input signals of a given system, this paper puts forward a detection method of <b>multifrequency</b> <b>signal</b> by using adaptive stochastic resonance, which analyzed the frequency characteristics and the parallel number of the input signals, adjusted system parameters automatically to the low frequency signals in the fixed step size, and then measured the stochastic resonance phenomenon based on {{the frequency of the}} periodic signals to select the most appropriate indicators in the middle or high frequency. Finally, the optimized system parameters are founded and the frequency of the given signals is extracted in the frequency domain of the stochastic resonance output signals.

Then, the entire spectrum of GNSS signal is directly digitized through RF sampling at a very fast sampling rate. After that, the decimation and filtering network is designed to lower the sampling rate efficiently.

40|$|Abstract If the RMS {{value is}} gained by digital {{processing}} of sequence of signal samples, both uncertainty and bias of the measured value {{depend on the}} algorithm used. Since in practice signal sampling is usually non-coherent, leakage occurs in signal DFT spectrum and definition of the RMS of periodic signals in time domain is violated. The paper compares three different DSP algorithms of RMS measurement by non-coherent sampling {{from the point of}} view of measurement bias and uncertainty for various leakage levels and data window used. Results of simulations and example of measurement are evaluated for monofrequency signals. For non-coherent signal sampling a new and effective approach to RMS value measurement in time domain, a new method of finding exact signal frequency (different from those of DFT grid) based on two DFT phase spectra computation, and a method of automatic RMS value bias correction in frequency domain are presented. The reported results can easily be extended to <b>multifrequency</b> <b>signals...</b>|$|R

A <b>multifrequency</b> <b>signal</b> decomposition technology to identify the main components of the measured signal and reject the image mode produced by noise has been used.

Furthermore, because of the deficiency of the traditional least square method, a new genetic identification method to identify the bearing dynamic characteristic parameters has been proposed. The method has been effective albeit with few testing points and operation cases. The derivation of oil-film dynamic coefficients could also provide a basis for shaft system natural vibration characteristic and vibration response analysis.

40|$|This chapter {{presents}} {{a new class}} of signals based on frequency coding sequences that may be constructed by means of perfect difference sets. These sequences give rise to frequency-coded signals of a specific structure characterized by nonuniform distribution of the number of subpulses over the frequencies. Such a structure allows achievement of considerably lower sidelobes {{in the vicinity of the}} main lobe of the time autocorrelation function relative to those exhibited by Costas signals without using weighting functions. It is clear that unlike the weighting, this approach doesn’t result in signal-to-noise ratio degradation although the main lobe broadening still remains. In addition these new signals exhibit thumbtack ambiguity functions with relatively low sidelobes over a wide region of the time-frequency plane. The chapter is organized as follows.

Motivated by the necessity to improve trajectory tracking in such applications, this paper addresses the problem of rate dependent hysteretic nonlinearity in piezoelectric actuators (PEA). The classical second order Dahl model for hysteresis encapsulation is introduced first, followed by the identification of parameters through particle swarm optimization. A novel inversion based feedforward mechanism in combination with a feedback compensator is proposed to achieve high-precision tracking wherein the paradoxical concept of noise as a performance enhancer is introduced {{in the realm of}} PZAs. Having observed that dither induced stochastic resonance in the presence of periodic forcing reduces tracking error, dither capability is further explored in conjunction with a novel output harmonics based adaptive control scheme. The proposed adaptive controller is then augmented with an internal model control based approach to impart robustness against parametric variations and external disturbances. The proposed control law has been employed to track <b>multifrequency</b> <b>signals</b> with consistent compensation of rate dependent hysteresis of the PEA.
