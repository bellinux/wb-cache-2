5|$|After trying {{that for}} a while and with no land in sight, Taylor decided that it was {{impossible}} for them to fly so far west and not reach Florida. He believed that he might have been near the Key West Islands. What followed was a series of serious confusions between Taylor, his team and the control tower. Taylor was not sure whether he was near Bahama or Key West, and he was not sure which direction was which due to compass malfunction. The control tower informed Taylor that he could not be <b>in</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West</b> since the wind that day did not blow that way. Some of his teammates believed that their compass was working. Taylor then set a course northeast according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were <b>in</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West.</b> When that failed, Taylor set a course west according to their compass, which should take them to Florida if they were in Bahama. If Taylor stayed this course he would have reached land before running out of fuel. However, at some point Taylor decided that he had tried going west enough. He then once again set a course northeast, thinking they were near Key West after all. Finally, his flight ran out of fuel and may have crashed into the ocean somewhere north of Abaco Island and east of Florida.|$|E
5|$|At the time, Jeanne was one {{of three}} November hurricanes in the Gulf of Mexico; it was the first {{tropical}} cyclone to attain hurricane strength in the Gulf of Mexico during November. The late season storm surprised maritime interests, and two barges broke free from towing vessels. Indirectly, the hurricane produced heavy precipitation that peaked at 23.28inches (591mm) <b>in</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West.</b> Minor beach erosion occurred along the Texas coast, where tides were two to four feet above normal; coastal flooding affected the state, which was heavily impacted by tropical cyclones in August and September. Jeanne caused no deaths.|$|E
5|$|Cooley {{maintained}} friendly {{relations and}} {{trade with the}} Seminole Indians in the area. In the early nineteenth century, Creek Indians had moved from Alabama and joined the Seminoles. In 1835, white settlers killed Creek chief Alibama and burned his hut in a dispute. As Justice of the Peace, Cooley jailed the settlers, but they were released due to insufficient evidence after a hearing at the Monroe County Court <b>in</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West.</b> The Creek people blamed Cooley, saying he withheld evidence. The growing uneasiness between the Creeks and the whites led to the Creeks' emigration to the Okeechobee area.|$|E

5000|$|Changes also {{represented}} {{the beginning of}} the end of the [...] "Key West Albums": the Don Gant-produced A White Sport Coat and a Pink Crustacean (1973), Living & Dying in 3/4 Time (1974), A1A (1974), and Havaña Daydreamin' (1975). These four albums capture the feel of early 1970s Key West, Florida and Buffett's experiences as a struggling musician and storyteller. Although the albums are not exclusively about Key West, they detail the laid back island ethos of the small island city and its pre-"condo commando" [...] status as an American Casablanca ... a place where no one knows your name and would not care if they did. At the time, Key West was a derelict navy town looking for a direction and was filled with small bars and restaurants craving troubadours like Buffett, Steve Goodman, Jerry Jeff Walker, and others who would play for bar money. The albums document life in the Gulf of Mexico Region ("Biloxi", [...] "Banana Republics", [...] "Woman Goin' Crazy on Caroline Street", [...] "Wonder Why We Ever Go Home") with displays of touring craziness ("Miss You So Badly"). After Changes, Buffett's scope grew to include the entire Caribbean and, later, the vast expanse of what would become [...] "world music." [...] Buffett's Key West experiences would pepper his later work (even recording his albums <b>in</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West's</b> Shrimpboat Sound), but not like it did in the 1973-1977 period. It is this period, along with the 1978 and 1979 albums that created the mythos Jimmy Buffett has parlayed into icon status as a performer, restaurateur, entrepreneur, author, and celebrity.|$|R

Subsequently, Fitzpatrick was elected as representative for Monroe County to the Territorial Legislative Council. The unanimous vote for Fitzpatrick in New River was questioned by the Key West Inquirer. Cooley's conduct was implicitly questioned as well, since as Justice of the Peace, Cooley conducted the non-secret balloting. <b>In</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West,</b> Fitzpatrick lost to William Hackley.|$|E

5|$|Richard Fitzpatrick, by {{that time}} the owner of a {{successful}} plantation with coconut and lime trees, plantains, and sugarcane, pressed for the appointment of Cooley as Justice of the Peace in 1831, making Cooley responsible for adjudicating disputes of persons and property, punishment of minor offenders by fines and whippings, and oversight of the activities of wreckers. Serious offenders were jailed <b>in</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West.</b> By that time, Cooley owned a schooner and took trips not only to take prisoners but to trade coontie, sugarcane, and tropical fruit with Cape Florida, Indian Key, Key West and Havana.|$|E

5|$|The {{most intense}} {{tropical}} cyclone {{of the season}} was the Florida Keys hurricane. Many deaths occurred after ships capsized in Bahamas, the Florida Keys, and Cuba. Strong winds left about $2million in damage <b>in</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West.</b> After crossing the Gulf of Mexico, severe impact was reported in Texas, especially the Corpus Christi area. Overall, the hurricane caused 828fatalities and $22million in damage, $20million of which was inflicted in Texas alone. Three other tropical cyclones developed in September, including two tropical storms and one tropical depression, all of which left negligible impact on land. The final tropical system of the season also did not affect land and became extratropical on November15.|$|E

5|$|After {{emerging}} {{into the}} Straits of Florida on September21, the storm resumed intensification, before striking near Boca Chica Key, Florida with winds of 120mph (195km/h). By early on September22, the system peaked as a Category4 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of 130mph (215km/h). Shortly thereafter, another landfall occurred near Chokoloskee, Florida {{at the same}} intensity. Severe damage {{was reported in the}} state due to strong winds. The storm was considered the worst <b>in</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West</b> since the 1919 Florida Keys hurricane. Throughout the state, 1,200homes were severely damaged or destroyed, while 40businesses were demolished and 237suffered impact. Throughout Florida, there were three fatalities and approximately $12million (1948USD) in damage, over half of which was inflicted on crops. The storm rapidly weakened while crossing the state and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean as only a Category1 hurricane later on September22. Slight fluctuations in intensity occurred before the hurricane became extratropical early on September24, while located northwest of Bermuda.|$|E
5|$|In Cuba, {{the storm}} caused {{hundreds}} of deaths, capsized dozens of ships, obliterated buildings, uprooted trees, and ruined crops. Many towns were wholly destroyed or flattened and never recovered, while others disappeared entirely. Damage in the United States was considerably better-chronicled despite being less severe. <b>In</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West,</b> widespread destruction was noted, with 40deaths, many vessels rendered unfit, and widespread structural damage, with several buildings swept off of their foundations {{and hundreds of}} others flattened. Few supplies arrived in the following days and relief efforts were gradual, with few resources within the town's vicinity. Along other sections of the Southeastern U.S. coast, copious rainfall and moderate winds impacted agriculture, shipping, and residences. As the storm tracked along the Middle-Atlantic coast, similar effects were reported: there, the gale inundated many areas, impeded communications, destroyed railroads and canals, and flattened structures. Despite extensive damage, only two deaths were recorded outside Cuba and Florida. Along its entire track, the hurricane caused $338,000 in losses and at least 164deaths.|$|E

5|$|The Hurricane Warning Service, {{operated}} by the United States Weather Bureau and the predecessor to the National Hurricane Center, issued hurricane warnings from Fort Myers to Miami, including the Florida Keys on October4. Miami Weather Bureau chief Grady Norton urged residents to take precautions and concentrate on further advisories. On October5, the hurricane warning was revised to include Naples to Jupiter. Additionally, other warnings were issued for areas surrounding Lake Okeechobee due to flooding concerns. Four U.S. Navy wartime housing project areas <b>in</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West</b> were evacuated. About 100Seminoles fled the Brighton Seminole Indian Reservation, with 95% of the property still inundated from the September hurricane. Two 25-car trains evacuated about 5,000people in the Lake Okeechobee area in Lake Harbor and transported them to Sebring.

5|$|The {{combination}} of a large high pressure system and Jeanne produced rough seas over the northern Gulf of Mexico; wave heights reached 15feet (4.60m). On November 11, a ship reported sustained winds of 110mph (175km/h), although this reading was discarded and attributed to intense squalls. <b>In</b> <b>Key</b> <b>West,</b> the storm's outer fringes produced a record-breaking 24-hour rainfall total of 23.28inches (591mm); 13.58inches (345mm) fell within six hours.

The heavy precipitation was attributed to a mesoscale feature; an inflow band intersected with an adjacent stationary front, which {{also contributed to the}} deluge. Schools and most businesses were closed, while flights were grounded at Key West International Airport; authorities urged residents to stay home. Telephone and power services were cut to some areas of the city.|$|E
