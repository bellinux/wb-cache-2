We applied three criteria to <b>filter</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of miRNAs to the most relevant one: (A) the miRNA {{had to have a}} DESeq 2 differential expression FDR < 0.1; (B) the targets of the miRNA had to be changing in the opposite direction (if the miRNA is up-regulated, the targets must be down-regulated, and vice versa); (C) the miRNA expression profile had to have a statistically significant correlation with TDP- 43 expression profile (FDR < 0.1). The results of this step for LUAD and LUSC are shown in Tables S 9 and S 10, respectively.|$|E

The complete system {{is based on the}} use of both visible and far infrared cameras; in an initial phase it produces a list of areas of attention in the images which can contain pedestrians. Starting from the assumption that human shapes are mostly symmetrical and feature a number of vertical edges, the symmetry and edge density content of these areas is computed. The results is used to <b>filter</b> <b>the</b> <b>list,</b> discarding areas of attention that feature a scarce symmetry content. At the same time, the size of each area is refined to match the symmetry content and therefore to better adapt to human shapes. Moreover, this module can be successfully used to partition areas that contains two or more human shapes. I...|$|E

Here, packing refers to the set of all pairs of atoms in the molecule. Among all methods developed to assess threedimensional models, statistical potentials are subject both to praise for their power of discrimination, and to criticism for the weaknesses of their theoretical foundations. Classical derivations of pairwise potentials assume statistical independence of all pairs of atoms. This assumption, however, is not valid in general. We show that we can <b>filter</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of all interactions in a protein to generate a much smaller subset of pairs that retains most of the structural information contained in proteins. The filter is based on a geometric method called alpha shapes that captures the packing in a conformation.

So, we implemented the conceptualization and co-occurring terms enrichment technique in our work, for a given short text and presented a novel idea of including verb terms in text enrichment. First, we computed <b>the</b> sorted <b>list</b> of verbs occurring in <b>the</b> dataset and <b>filtered</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> with <b>the</b> verbs that somewhat represent the categories we had considered. Then, we inserted those <b>filtered</b> verbs into <b>the</b> previously computed feature vocabulary. This way, the representative verbs become the feature for incoming short text.

Candidate lines have been traditionally regarded as expert-provided system information. However, given the need to plan larger networks, identifying interesting candidates is an issue of increasing relevance and complexity. This paper proposes a consistent method to tackle this problem. First, an automatic and objective candidate discovery mechanism based on sensitivities proposes potentially interesting investments. Then, a candidate management strategy <b>filters</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of candidates to keep problem size within tractable levels in a Mathematical Programming context without compromising global optimality. Finally, a candidate analysis tool reveals the relationships among investments from a relatively fast and simple power flow study.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) may act as regulators and potential treatment targets for epileptogenesis.

The current study aimed at finding the mutation that causing EDS type VII C also known as "Dermatosparaxis" in this family. METHODS: Through systematic data querying of the electronic medical records (EMRs) of over 80, 000 individuals, we recently identified an EDS family that indicate an autosomal dominant inheritance. The family was consented for genomic analysis of their de-identified data. After a negative screen for known mutations, we performed whole genome sequencing on the male proband, his affected father, and unaffected mother. We <b>filtered</b> <b>the</b> <b>list</b> of non-synonymous variants that are common between the affected individuals. RESULTS: The analysis of non-synonymous variants lead to identifying a novel mutation in the ADAMTSL 2 (p. Gly 421 Ser) gene in the affected individuals. Sanger sequencing confirmed the mutation. CONCLUSION: Our work is significant {{not only because it}} sheds new light on the pathophysiology of EDS for the affected family and the field at large, but also because it demonstrates the utility of unbiased large-scale clinical recruitment in deciphering the genetic etiology of rare mendelian diseases. With unbiased large-scale clinical recruitment we strive to sequence as many rare mendelian diseases as possible, and this work in EDS serves as a successful proof of concept to that effect...|$|R
