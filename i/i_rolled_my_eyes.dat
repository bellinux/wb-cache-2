6000|$|I {{opened my}} eyes in daylight. My head was roughly bandaged, and {{the man with the}} {{withered}} arm was watching my face. I looked about me, trying to remember what had happened, and for a space I could not recollect. <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> into the corner, and saw the old woman, no longer abstracted, pouring out some drops of medicine from a little blue phial into a glass. [...] "Where am I?" [...] I asked; [...] "I seem to remember you, and yet I cannot remember who you are." ...|$|E

'If <b>I</b> <b>roll</b> back <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> without turning <b>my</b> head, I believe I {{can see what}} she is doing, and she won't be any the wiser,' thought he. So {{he rolled his eyes}} back and then looked straight ahead again. What he had seen made him want to see more. He tried it again. Just imagine how he felt when he found that his eyes wouldn't roll. He couldn't move them a bit. All he could do was to stare straight ahead. It frightened him dreadfully, and he kept trying and trying to roll his eyes, but they were fixed fast. He could see in only one direction, the way his head was turned.|$|R

I was always matched tough, and it was always {{expected}} thing to get matched tough. I went to tournaments knowing I wasn’t going to get easy fights.

In fact, Gateworld was so impressive in its scope and detail that we eventually abandoned updating the show's massive bible ...in favor of directing prospective freelancers to the site. It blew all other Stargate-related sites, even the studio's which paled by comparison. Over the years, Gateworld evolved alongside the franchise, growing and improving. In later years, <b>I</b> would <b>roll</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and fans on other forums would accuse Darren and David - [...] "the Gateworld guys" [...] as we called them - of simply being a PR arm of the franchise. The truth is, as incredible as they've been {{in the amount of}} support they’ve shown, there have also been incidences in which we've strongly disagreed with some of the decisions they've taken.

5000|$|The seventh season {{received}} mixed reviews. Alan Sepinwall {{gave the}} season a mixed review and criticized the flash-forwards throughout the season, saying that [...] "the show is just much, much stronger when its stories dwell {{on matters of}} the present or the past, and where the writers don't have to act like magicians {{trying to keep the}} audience from figuring out how the trick works. And the finale affirmed that belief for me. The parts that had little or nothing to do with things to come were quite good; the parts that were all about the future made me <b>roll</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and ask, for the umpteenth time, 'Really?

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> up <b>my</b> {{two little}} boys in my great fur cloak, which I had happily brought with me, for no one seemed {{disposed}} to take any charge of poor little Mericour, and Nicolas fetches me the cushions from the carriage, so that they were tolerably comfortable.|$|R

500|$|Anime News Network {{had four}} editors review {{the first episode}} of the anime: Carl Kimlinger {{expressed}} doubts about {{the premise of the}} show, but liked the over-saturated visuals and the concept of the protagonists cheating against cheaters; Rebecca Silverman called the characters unlikeable and criticized the expositions for lacking in action, but noted her issues may be resolved in further episodes; and Theron Martin described the plot as wish-fulfilment, noted Sora has too much character for a hikikomori, called Sora's relationship with Shiro creepy, and concluded the series may turn out well if Sora is not an indomitable character. The fourth reviewer, Hope Chapman, expressed absolute disdain towards the series. She expressed hatred towards Sora's character, noting the misunderstood nerd turned respected genius aspect is lazy wish-fulfillment and how he thrives in a world for [...] "misanthropic Shut-ins". Chapman likened the over-saturated colors to vomit, called the character designs hideous, and concluded her review with [...] "nothing has made me <b>roll</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> gag, or feel more irrationally angry this season than this insulting self-insert pandering trash heap".|$|R
6000|$|She laughed drearily. [...] "My work! If {{you only}} {{knew what it}} is like you would not talk to me about it. Every day <b>I</b> <b>roll</b> <b>my</b> stone up the hill, and every night it seems to roll down again. But you have never taught in a village school. How can you know? I work all day, and in the evening perhaps I have to mend the tablecloths, or--what do you think?--write my father's sermons. It sounds curious, does it not, that I should write sermons? But I do. I wrote the one he is going to preach next Sunday. It makes very little {{difference}} to him what it is so long as he can read it, and, of course, I never say anything which can offend anybody, and I do not think that they listen much. Very few people go to church in Bryngelly." ...|$|R
5000|$|So, {{one weekend}} this summer, <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> up <b>my</b> sleeves and {{dove into the}} {{trenches}} with our logo design team ... We spent the majority of Saturday and Sunday designing the logo from start to finish, {{and we had a}} ton of fun weighing every minute detail.

5000|$|The song, in its {{original}} incarnation, is highly sexual. Perhaps its most salacious lyric, which was absent from the later Bill Haley rendition, is [...] "I've been holdin' it in, way down underneath / You make me <b>roll</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes,</b> baby, make me grit my teeth". may actually be [...] "Over the hill, way down underneath. On the recording, Turner slurred the lyric [...] "holdin' it in", since this line may have been considered too risqué for publication. The chorus used [...] "shake, rattle and roll" [...] to refer to boisterous intercourse, {{in the same way}} that the words [...] "rock and roll" [...] were first used by numerous rhythm and blues singers, starting with Trixie Smith's [...] "My Man Rocks Me (With One Steady Roll)" [...] in 1922, and continuing on prominently through the 1940s and 1950s. Stone stated that the line about [...] "a one-eyed cat peepin' in a seafood store" [...] was suggested to him by Atlantic session drummer Sam [...] "Baby" [...] Lovett, which is also a sly sexual reference, the [...] "one-eyed cat" [...] being the male organ and the more traditional [...] "seafood" [...] reference being the female organ.|$|R
5000|$|Season {{seven of}} How I Met Your Mother {{received}} mixed reviews from critics. Alan Sepinwall gave the season a mixed review and criticized the flash-forwards {{throughout the season}} saying, [...] "the show is just much, much stronger when its stories dwell on matters of the present or the past, and where the writers don't have to act like magicians {{trying to keep the}} audience from figuring out how the trick works. And the finale affirmed that belief for me. The parts that had little or nothing to do with things to come were quite good; the parts that were all about the future made me <b>roll</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> and ask, for the umpteenth time, 'Really? This is where you're going with this?'". Ethan Alter of Television Without Pitty, gave the season a lukewarm response. In his review of the season finale, he criticized the Robin-Barney story-line throughout the season, writing:"So after an entire season, we're basically right back where we started, with the writers having taken 24 episodes to stage a reveal that could have happened in the first five minutes of the premiere and had the exact same impact." ...|$|R

5000|$|Dados (Dice) (#7, Season 1): Dados was {{a special}} {{shortcut}} that advanced the contestant to space number 20, at which point he rolled again.

6000|$|And {{both laughed}} and kissed, and sighed with content. [...] "I'm goin' to turn pincher, now," [...] he announced, after quite an {{interval}} of meditation. [...] "No more drinks with the boys. It's {{me for the}} water wagon. And I'm goin' to ease down on smokes. Huh! Don't see why <b>I</b> can't <b>roll</b> <b>my</b> own cigarettes.

60|$|Free!--and in {{the grasp}} of the Inquisition! I had {{scarcely}} stepped from my wooden bed of horror upon the stone floor of the prison, when {{the motion of the}} hellish machine ceased and I beheld it drawn up, by some invisible force, through the ceiling. This was a lesson which I took desperately to heart. My every motion was undoubtedly watched. Free!--I had but escaped death in one form of agony, to be delivered unto worse than death in some other. With that thought <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>my</b> eves nervously around on the barriers of iron that hemmed me in. Something unusual--some change which, at first, I could not appreciate distinctly--it was obvious, had taken place in the apartment. For many minutes of a dreamy and trembling abstraction, I busied myself in vain, unconnected conjecture. During this period, I became aware, for the first time, of the origin of the sulphurous light which illumined the cell. It proceeded from a fissure, about half an inch in width, extending entirely around the prison {{at the base of the}} walls, which thus appeared, and were, completely separated from the floor. I endeavored, but of course in vain, to look through the aperture.|$|R
6000|$|... "'Young man,' I said, 'have you a mother?' (He looked serious, {{as though}} regretting his act! and further to impress him <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> up <b>my</b> right sleeve with {{greatest}} care.) 'Are {{you prepared to}} die?' (I got a stealthy crouch on, and put a cat-foot forward.) 'But a minute, a brief minute, stands between you and eternity.' (Here I crooked my right hand into a claw and slid the other foot up.) 'Young man, young man,' I trumpeted, 'in thirty seconds I shall tear your heart dripping from your bosom and stoop to hear you shriek in hell.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Reserve pilot Uri Bina was section leader. He called [...] "Three pulls" [...] {{over the}} radio and I pulled with him into a pop-up {{manoeuvre}} {{for the first time}} in my life in a Skyhawk. <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> onto <b>my</b> back at 6000 ft and dove. The yellow glow of an SA-2 missile came toward me from Port Said, at which point I thought to myself [...] "is the whole world against me today?" [...] I tried to execute the attack and rejoin Uri Bina. [...] "Four, your bombs didn't release" [...] Uri called. I returned to the initial point before heading back to the target once again, this time alone.|$|R
60|$|But I was not sleepy. When I had {{stretched}} out on the soft bed of pine-needles with my rifle close by, and was all snug and warm under the heavy blanket, it seemed that nothing was so far away from me as sleep. The wonder of my situation kept me wide awake, <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> on the dim huge pines and the glimmer of stars, and my ears open to the rush and roar of the wind, every sense alert. Hours must have passed as I lay there living over the things that had happened and trying to think out what was to come. At last, however, <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> over on <b>my</b> side, and with my hand on the rifle and my cheek close to the sweet-smelling pine-needles I dropped asleep.|$|R
60|$|Feet swayed about me, {{and some}} hobnailed miner kicked my ankle and went stumbling. There were shouts and curses, and then {{everything}} had swept past me. <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> over on <b>my</b> face and beheld the chauffeur, young Verrall, and Lord Redcar--the latter holding up his long skirts of fur, and making a grotesque figure--one behind the other, in full bolt across a coldly comet-lit interval, towards the open gates of the colliery.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with celebrity columnist Michael Musto of The Village Voice, Brown recalled how Madonna first reacted when saw the film: [...] "At first I heard she really liked it. Then I heard she didn't like the scene where <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> around on <b>my</b> dog's grave. She'd rolled around on her mother's — like that wasn't offensive enough? Then she didn't like the scene with the dancers suing me, because that really happened to her." ...|$|R
5000|$|The White Queen {{received}} generally {{mixed reviews}} after airing on the Starz network on 10 August 2013. Joanne Ostrow of The Denver Post described the series as [...] "Sexy, empowering and violent". Linda Stasi of the New York Post {{agreed that the}} series is a hit, exclaiming [...] "The White Queen a royal winner". It was again unfavourably compared to HBO's high budget and fast-paced Game of Thrones. In comparison to Game of Thrones Neil Genzlinger speculates that [...] "even if dragons were allowed, they’d mostly be lounging around and, between bouts of relatively tame dragon sex, talking about eating people rather than actually eating them". The performances of Janet McTeer and James Frain were praised by several American reviewers. Amanda Hale, despite receiving praise for her performance by British reviewers, was unfavourably reviewed by U.S. critic Matthew Gilbert. He said [...] "There were moments when <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>my</b> eyes—Amanda Hale, {{as the mother of}} young Henry Tudor, looks as if she is going to explode with ill intent. Really, her performance could be transposed into a Mel Brooks spoof". Louise Mellor of Den of Geek added [...] "Why does Lady Margaret Beaufort constantly look like she is sucking on a Murray Mint?" [...] TV Guide writer Matt Roush praised Hale's performance as [...] "intense", and favored the series, labeling it as [...] "fun", and on a one to ten scale, ranking it at seven.|$|R
500|$|Reynolds' {{appearance}} was critically acclaimed. VanDerWerff professed {{that he was}} surprised that it was executed well, as he avouched that shows featuring guest appearances ruin the chemistry of the main cast. [...] "Episodes with big special guest stars can often ruin {{the rhythm of the}} main gang, but I was surprised at how readily the show incorporated Reynolds into the storyline, {{to the point where he}} almost felt like an organic part of the ensemble," [...] avouched VanDerWerff. [...] "The fact that he's still dating Malory at the end of the episode implies that he might pop back in as the season proceeds, and I wouldn't be adverse to that happening, where many special guest stars might make me <b>roll</b> <b>my</b> <b>eyes</b> in irritation." [...] He praised the chemistry between Reynolds and Benjamin, and commended Reynolds for having the will power to poke fun at himself. Carp echoed similar sentiments; [...] "H. Jon Benjamin alone is a voice-over superstar [...] but combined with Reynolds and the rest of the cast, that was some animated magic and a fantastic way to kick off the third season." [...] Bonaime thought that Reynolds was [...] "fine with being self-deprecating, and he gives some fantastic moments with Archer." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall enjoyed how Reynolds was utilized in [...] "The Man from Jupiter". [...] "There are times when it can feel awkward when a show spends an episode sucking up to a very special guest star, but it worked here because so much of Archer's personality—and so much of the show's approach to action—feels inspired by all those movies Reynolds did in the '70s and early '80s when he was the biggest movie star in the world.|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] she began, presently, [...] "why I {{love you}}--and {{love you so}} much?... I know now {{what it is to}} be an {{abandoned}} female. I AM an abandoned female. I'm not ashamed--of the things I'm doing. I want to put myself into your hands. You know--I wish <b>I</b> could <b>roll</b> <b>my</b> little body up small and squeeze it into your hand and grip your fingers upon it. Tight. I want you to hold me and have me SO.... Everything. Everything. It's a pure joy of giving--giving to YOU. I have never spoken of these things to any human being. Just dreamed--and ran away even from my dreams. It is as if my lips had been sealed about them. And now I break the seals--for you. Only I wish--I wish to-day I was a thousand times, ten thousand times more beautiful." ...|$|R
60|$|But I knowed better. I had it out {{of there}} before they was half-way down stairs. I groped along up to my cubby, and hid it there till I could {{get a chance to}} do better. I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres, because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking: I knowed that very well. Then I turned in, with my clothes all on; but I couldn't a gone to sleep if I'd a wanted to, I was in such a sweat to get through with the business. By and by I heard the king and the duke come up; so <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> off <b>my</b> pallet and laid with my chin {{at the top of my}} ladder, and waited to see if {{anything}} was going to happen. But nothing did.|$|R
5000|$|... "I Useta Lover" [...] is a 1990 song by Irish {{rock group}} The Saw Doctors. It {{is the second}} single off the If This <b>Is</b> Rock and <b>Roll,</b> <b>I</b> Want <b>My</b> Old Job Back album. It stayed at the #1 {{position}} in the Irish chart for nine weeks {{and became one of}} the best-selling singles of all time in the country.

5000|$|Following {{their success}} at Féile, the band {{released}} their second single, [...] "I Useta Lover," [...] a humorously off-colour paean to an ex-girlfriend. The single topped the Irish charts in September 1990 and spent nine weeks at number one, becoming Ireland's all-time best-selling single. A re-released [...] "N17" [...] reached {{number one in}} the Irish charts at Christmas 1990, and the following year, the band's debut album If This <b>Is</b> Rock and <b>Roll,</b> <b>I</b> Want <b>My</b> Old Job Back entered the Irish albums chart at number one.|$|R
6000|$|Two {{thousand}} feet, probably, we {{mounted to}} what Frank called Little Buckskin. In the west a copper glow, ridged with lead-colored clouds, marked {{where the sun}} had set. The air was very thin and icy cold. At the first clump of pinyon pines, we made dry camp. When I sat down {{it was as if}} I had been anchored. Frank solicitously remarked that I looked [...] "sort of beat." [...] Jim built a roaring fire and began getting supper. A snow squall came on the rushing wind. The air grew colder, and though I hugged the fire, I could not get warm. When I had satisfied <b>my</b> hunger, <b>I</b> <b>rolled</b> out <b>my</b> sleeping-bag and crept into it. I stretched my aching limbs and did not move again. Once I awoke, drowsily feeling the warmth of the fire, and I heard Frank say: [...] "He's asleep, dead to the world!" ...|$|R
