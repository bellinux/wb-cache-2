To determine the state of various stages of hemostasis in pregnant women with <b>hydramnion</b> as a risk factor for premature detachment of the placenta. Results. There was investigated the state of hemostasis in pregnant women with <b>hydramnion</b> by low piezoelectric thromboelastography (LPTEG) and standard coagulogram. According to the LPTEG results this group of women was found to have increased plasma coagulation potential manifested in elevated constant thrombin activity (TAC) by 76. 8 %, the intensity of coagulation drive (ICD) by 74. 9 %, maximum clot density (MA) by 16. 8 %, shortening of coagulation time (T 3) by 7. 8 % and inhibition of fibrinolysis manifested by decrease in retraction intensity and clot lysis (RICL) by 67. 7 % (p< 0. 05). Conclusions. The state of hemostasis in pregnant women with <b>hydramnion</b> is characterized by increased plasma coagulation and inhibition of fibrinolysis potential that are factors of preparing the woman’s body for the upcoming birth to control and minimize blood loss.

40|$|Hydrops amnii, {{also known}} as <b>hydramnion,</b> or hydramnios, is a term taken from medical {{terminology}} where in the female the allantois ceases to exist at an early date and the dropsy naturally occurs in the amnion. In veterinary obstetrics this term is somewhat of a misnomer since in domestic animals there exists two ample cavities of the fetal envelops, the amniotic and allantoic, which regularly contains fluids in varying amounts. In veterinary obstetrics the term is used to indicate an excessive amount of fluid in the allantoic or the amniotic cavities. These two cavities communicate through the urethra-urinary bladder-urachus passageway and approximately equal pressure is maintained within the two cavities. The allantoic sac is much larger and generally contains the major volume of the fluid...|$|E
40|$|In the {{scientific}} sources {{of recent years}} one can find statements {{about the role of}} connective tissue dysplasia with placentation disorders one of the manifestations of which is a local abruption of chorion and placental tissue. At present it is important not only to search for sensitive tests to control the effectiveness of treatment of retrochorionic hematomas and local forms of premature placental abruption but also to develop and implement treatment-and-prevention programs. We analyzed the course of pregnancy and labor in 80 women between 20 – 40 years of age with local non-progressive abruption of chorion and a normally positioned placenta, who were divided into two groups depending on the suggested complex of treatment and prevention in the program of optimization of pregnancy management. The control group included 20 relatively healthy women with a physiological course of pregnancy. It was reasonable and pathogenetically justifiable to start applying complex treatment of disturbed homeostatic processes from the pregestational stage. This accounted for the introducing a complex of vitamin agents, polyunsaturated fatty acids and angiogenic inductors into the treatment program. To achieve this goal, the pregestational preparation of this category of patients was complemented with a polyvitamin complex with folic acid, nitric oxide inductors and polyunsaturated fatty acids, which influenced not only the total effect of treatment but also increased the effectiveness of each component of the treatment program. The analysis of the prevalence of undifferentiated connective tissue dysplasia (UCTD) identified a constantly high percentage of women with a clinically significant dysplastic phenotype – 63 women (78. 75 %), providing convincing evidence of the fact that uteroplacental apoplexy was associated with congenital weakness of connective tissue (ОR - 18. 17; 95 % DІ; 6. 3 - 36. 5, р< 0. 001).   According to the analytical research, 54 out of 80 pregnant women (67. 5 %) with local non-progressive abruption of chorion and placenta developed various complications in the course of pregnancy – preeclampsia, placental dysfunction, threat of premature labor, uterine hemorrhage, etc. One should also note a considerable number of cases of fetal distress, which was to a certain extent associated with the existing complications in the course of pregnancy and labor and fetoplacental dysfunction. The analysis of the results of pregnancy completion showed a significant reduction in the prematurity rate. For instance, in women of the basic group, spontaneous abortion was observed 3. 5 times less often and premature labor 2 times less often than in the comparison group (р< 0. 05). Thus, in 80 % of pregnant women of the basic group the necessary conditions were created to develop and prolong their pregnancy and complete it with term labor whereas in the comparison group the percentage was 55 % (р< 0. 05). Besides, the use of the agents suggested by us enabled a decrease in the development of such gestational complications as chronic placental insufficiency by 2 times, late gestosis and <b>hydramnion</b> by 2. 5 times. Modification of the basic complex treatment by introducing the suggested membrane-stabilizing and antioxidant agents as well as the use of the indicated preventive measures at the stages of placentation and probable development of placental insufficiency helped decrease the percentage of abortions and the development of negative reproductive and perinatal losses...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} {{prevalence}} of gestational diabetes mellitus (GDM) among the pregnant women of Dhaka city {{and to find out}} the consequences or effects of GDM on pregnancy outcome. Materials and methods: This was a descriptive type of cross sectional study followed by cohort type of study, conducted in different hospitals in Dhaka city. Initially 960 pregnant women of 24 th to 28 th weeks were selected purposively; plasma glucose was measured at fasting and two hours after taking 75 g oral glucose load. Modified method of Carpenter and Coustan criteria was followed to diagnose GDM. For each GDM case diagnosed, one non-GDM pregnant women was taken as control after matching age and parity. Both groups were followed up to 4 wks after delivery to find out maternal and neonatal mortality and morbidities. Results: Out of 960 pregnant women 72 were GDM positive (7. 5 %). There was no maternal mortality but morbidities like <b>hydramnions</b> (p< 0. 001)), pre-eclampsia (p< 0. 001)), urinary tract infection (p< 0. 05), puerperial sepsis (p< 0. 05)) and surgical interventions (p< 0. 001) were more prevalent in GDM compared to non-GDM groups. The prevalence of antipartum haemorrhage, post partum haemorrhage, and eclampsia did not vary between the groups. There was one still birth, one perinatal mortality (due to respiratory distress syndrome) and one congenital anomaly observed in neonates of GDM mothers. More pre-term (p< 0. 01), post-term (p< 0. 01), low birth weight (p< 0. 001) an...|$|R
