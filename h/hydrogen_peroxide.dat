5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> is abundant {{across much of}} the surface of Europa. Because <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> decays into oxygen and water when combined with liquid water, the authors argue that it could be an important energy supply for simple life forms.|$|E
5|$|It {{also finds}} a {{use as a}} {{catalyst}} between acetone and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> to form the tetrameric form of acetone peroxide.|$|E
5|$|As {{with the}} {{chemical}} antioxidants, cells are protected against oxidative stress by an interacting network of antioxidant enzymes. Here, the superoxide released by {{processes such as}} oxidative phosphorylation is first converted to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> and then further reduced to give water. This detoxification pathway {{is the result of}} multiple enzymes, with superoxide dismutases catalysing the first step and then catalases and various peroxidases removing <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide.</b> As with antioxidant metabolites, the contributions of these enzymes to antioxidant defenses can be hard to separate from one another, but the generation of transgenic mice lacking just one antioxidant enzyme can be informative.|$|E
5|$|The {{reactive}} {{oxygen species}} produced in cells include <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> (H2O2), hypochlorous acid (HClO), and free radicals such as the hydroxyl radical (·OH) and the superoxide anion (O2−). The hydroxyl radical is particularly unstable and will react rapidly and non-specifically with most biological molecules. This species is produced from <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> in metal-catalyzed redox reactions such as the Fenton reaction. These oxidants can damage cells by starting chemical chain reactions such as lipid peroxidation, or by oxidizing DNA or proteins. Damage to DNA can cause mutations and possibly cancer, if not reversed by DNA repair mechanisms, while damage to proteins causes enzyme inhibition, denaturation and protein degradation.|$|E
5|$|A related {{problem for}} aerobic organisms is {{oxidative}} stress. Here, processes including oxidative phosphorylation {{and the formation}} of disulfide bonds during protein folding produce reactive oxygen species such as <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide.</b> These damaging oxidants are removed by antioxidant metabolites such as glutathione and enzymes such as catalases and peroxidases.|$|E
5|$|Antioxidants {{that are}} {{reducing}} agents can also act as pro-oxidants. For example, vitamin C has antioxidant activity when it reduces oxidizing substances such as <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> however, {{it will also}} reduce metal ions that generate free radicals through the Fenton reaction.|$|E
5|$|Black Arrow was a three-stage rocket, fuelled by RP-1 {{paraffin}} (kerosene) {{and high}} test peroxide, a concentrated form of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide.</b> It was retired after only four launches {{in favour of}} using American Scout rockets, which the Ministry of Defence calculated to be cheaper than maintaining the Black Arrow programme.|$|E
5|$|Industrial {{chemicals}} such as {{vinyl chloride}} and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> and environmental chemicals such as {{polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons}} found in smoke, soot and tar create a huge diversity of DNA adducts- ethenobases, oxidized bases, alkylated phosphotriesters and crosslinking of DNA, {{just to name a}} few.|$|E
5|$|Peroxiredoxins are peroxidases that {{catalyze}} {{the reduction}} of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> organic hydroperoxides, as well as peroxynitrite. They are divided into three classes: typical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; atypical 2-cysteine peroxiredoxins; and 1-cysteine peroxiredoxins. These enzymes share the same basic catalytic mechanism, in which a redox-active cysteine (the peroxidatic cysteine) in the active site is oxidized to a sulfenic acid by the peroxide substrate. Over-oxidation of this cysteine residue in peroxiredoxins inactivates these enzymes, but this can be reversed {{by the action of}} sulfiredoxin. Peroxiredoxins seem to be important in antioxidant metabolism, as mice lacking peroxiredoxin 1 or 2 have shortened lifespan and suffer from hemolytic anaemia, while plants use peroxiredoxins to remove <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> generated in chloroplasts.|$|E
5|$|The {{glutathione}} system includes glutathione, glutathione reductase, glutathione peroxidases, and glutathione S-transferases. This {{system is}} found in animals, plants and microorganisms. Glutathione peroxidase is an enzyme containing four selenium-cofactors that catalyzes the breakdown of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> and organic hydroperoxides. There are at least four different glutathione peroxidase isozymes in animals. Glutathione peroxidase 1 is the most abundant and is a very efficient scavenger of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> while glutathione peroxidase 4 is most active with lipid hydroperoxides. Surprisingly, glutathione peroxidase 1 is dispensable, as mice lacking this enzyme have normal lifespans, but they are hypersensitive to induced oxidative stress. In addition, the glutathione S-transferases show high activity with lipid peroxides. These enzymes are at particularly high levels in the liver and also serve in detoxification metabolism.|$|E
5|$|Other {{species have}} special glands to produce {{deterrent}} chemicals. The defensive glands of carabid ground beetles produce {{a variety of}} hydrocarbons, aldehydes, phenols, quinones, esters, and acids released from an opening {{at the end of}} the abdomen. African carabid beetles (for example, Anthia and Thermophilum – Thermophilum is sometimes included within Anthia) employ the same chemicals as ants: formic acid. Bombardier beetles have well-developed pygidial glands that empty from the sides of the intersegment membranes between the seventh and eighth abdominal segments. The gland is made of two containing chambers, one for hydroquinones and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> the other holding <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> and catalase enzymes. These chemicals mix and result in an explosive ejection, reaching a temperature of around , with the breakdown of hydroquinone to hydrogen, oxygen, and quinone. The oxygen propels the noxious chemical spray as a jet that can be aimed accurately at predators.|$|E
5|$|Uranium is {{extracted}} from its ores in various ways. In one method, the ore is burned and then reacted with nitric acid to convert uranium into a dissolved state. Treating the solution {{with a solution}} of tributyl phosphate (TBP) in kerosene transforms uranium into an organic form UO2(NO3)2(TBP)2. The insoluble impurities are filtered and the uranium {{is extracted}} by reaction with hydroxides as (NH4)2U2O7 or with <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> as UO4·2H2O.|$|E
5|$|An {{experimental}} coating able {{to change}} color was tested on Royal Navy submarines. On suggestion by Professor Leslie Cromby, lead oxide {{was applied to the}} hull, enabling it to become black on application of a solution of sulphite and sea water for night operation. For day sailing, a solution of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> and sea water would be applied, producing sulphate and returning the hull to a white colour desirable for daytime conditions.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the promise}} of the design, many {{operational}} officers were opposed to the use of volatile <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> aboard ship. Ultimately, the Mark 16 went into limited production while work on the Mark 17 was suspended in 1941, but resumed in 1944. Admiral Ernest King favored focusing research efforts on electric torpedoes so work on the oxygen system was downgraded. As such, the U.S. Navy made no combat use of the oxygen torpedo design during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes with single-substrate {{mechanisms}} include isomerases such as triosephosphateisomerase or bisphosphoglycerate mutase, intramolecular lyases such as {{adenylate cyclase}} and the hammerhead ribozyme, an RNA lyase. However, some enzymes that {{only have a}} single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms. Catalase {{is an example of}} this, as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> substrate, becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate. Although a single substrate is involved, the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping–pong mechanism, a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi-substrate reactions section below.|$|E
5|$|In August 2012, oxygen {{levels in}} the river {{were found to be}} low, {{following}} the death of thousands of fish. The Environment Agency were notified and aerated the water while they investigated the cause of the problem. This was thought to result from naturally occurring algae, which deplete the oxygen on which the fish depend, and may also have been affected by a reaction between <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> which is used to improve oxygen {{levels in the}} water, and traces of detergent. The reaction results in an unpleasant-looking foam building up on the surface, although the foam is not hazardous. The Winsford and District Angling Association, who use the river for fishing, believe it will take many years to restore the six species of fish affected by the incident.|$|E
5|$|Silver {{does not}} react with air, even at red heat, and thus was {{considered}} by alchemists as a noble metal along with gold. Its reactivity is intermediate between that of copper (which forms copper(I) oxide when heated in air to red heat) and gold. Like copper, silver reacts with sulfur and its compounds; in their presence, silver tarnishes in air {{to form the}} black silver sulfide (copper forms the green sulfate instead, while gold does not react). Unlike copper, silver will not react with the halogens, {{with the exception of}} the notoriously reactive fluorine gas, with which it forms the difluoride. While silver is not attacked by non-oxidizing acids, the metal dissolves readily in hot concentrated sulfuric acid, as well as dilute or concentrated nitric acid. In the presence of air, and especially in the presence of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> silver dissolves readily in aqueous solutions of cyanide.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} use of {{platinum}} is {{as a catalyst}} in chemical reactions, often as platinum black. It has been employed as a catalyst since the early 19th century, when platinum powder was used to catalyze the ignition of hydrogen. Its most important application is in automobiles as a catalytic converter, which allows the complete combustion of low concentrations of unburned hydrocarbons from the exhaust into carbon dioxide and water vapor. Platinum is also used in the petroleum industry as a catalyst {{in a number of}} separate processes, but especially in catalytic reforming of straight-run naphthas into higher-octane gasoline that becomes rich in aromatic compounds. PtO2, also known as Adams' catalyst, is used as a hydrogenation catalyst, specifically for vegetable oils. Platinum also strongly catalyzes the decomposition of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> into water and oxygen and it is used in fuel cells as a catalyst for the reduction of oxygen.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> in both {{liquid and}} as vaporized <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> (VHP), is another {{chemical}} sterilizing agent. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> is strong oxidant, which {{allows it to}} destroy {{a wide range of}} pathogens. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> is used to sterilize heat or temperature sensitive articles such as rigid endoscopes. In medical sterilization <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> is used at higher concentrations, ranging from around 35% up to 90%. The biggest advantage of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> as a sterilant is the short cycle time. Whereas the cycle time for ethylene oxide may be 10 to 15 hours, some modern <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> sterilizers have a cycle time as short as 28 minutes.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> is {{unstable}} and slowly decomposes {{in the presence}} of base or a catalyst. Because of its instability, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> is typically stored with a stabilizer in a weakly acidic solution. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> is found in biological systems including the human body. Enzymes that use or decompose <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> are classified as peroxidases.|$|E
25|$|In aqueous {{solutions}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> {{differs from}} the pure material due {{to the effects of}} hydrogen bonding between water and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> molecules. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> and water form a eutectic mixture, exhibiting freezing-point depression; pure water has a melting point of 0°C and pure <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> of −0.43°C. The boiling point of the same mixtures is also depressed in relation with the mean of both boiling points (125.1°C). It occurs at 114°C. This boiling point is 14°C greater than that of pure water and 36.2°C less than that of pure <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide.</b>|$|E
25|$|Both the {{effectiveness}} {{and safety of}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> therapy is scientifically questionable. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> is produced by the immune system but in a carefully controlled manner. Cells called phagocytes engulf pathogens and then use <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> to destroy them. The peroxide is toxic to both the cell and the pathogen and so is kept within a special compartment, called a phagosome. Free <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> will damage any tissue it encounters via oxidative stress; a process which also has been proposed {{as a cause of}} cancer.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{stumbling}} blocks that would-be rocket pack builders have faced is the difficulty of obtaining concentrated <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> which is no longer produced by many chemical companies. The few companies that produce high-concentration <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> only sell to large corporations or governments, forcing some amateurs and professionals to {{set up their own}} <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> distillation installations. High-concentration <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> for rocket belts was produced by Peroxide Propulsion (Gothenburg, Sweden) from 2004 to 2010, but after a serious accident Peroxide Propulsion stopped making it.|$|E
25|$|Low {{levels of}} {{catalase}} {{may play a}} role in the graying process of human hair. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> is naturally produced by the body and broken down by catalase. If catalase levels decline, <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> cannot be broken down so well. The <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> interferes with the production of melanin, the pigment that gives hair its color.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> is {{also used}} for tooth {{whitening}}. It {{can be found in}} most whitening toothpastes. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> has shown positive results involving teeth lightness and chroma shade parameters. It works by oxidizing colored pigments onto the enamel where the shade of the tooth can indeed become lighter. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> can be mixed with baking soda and salt to make a home-made toothpaste.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> has {{important}} roles as a signalling molecule {{in the regulation}} {{of a wide variety}} of biological processes. The compound is a major factor implicated in the free-radical theory of aging, based on how readily <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> can decompose into a hydroxyl radical and how superoxide radical byproducts of cellular metabolism can react with ambient water to form <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide.</b> These hydroxyl radicals in turn readily react with and damage vital cellular components, especially those of the mitochondria. At least one study has also tried to link <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> production to cancer. These studies have frequently been quoted in fraudulent treatment claims.|$|E
25|$|Pure <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> {{was long}} {{believed}} to be unstable, as early attempts to separate it from the water, which is present during synthesis, all failed. This instability was due to traces of impurities (transition-metal salts), which catalyze the decomposition of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide.</b> Pure <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> was first obtained in 1894—almost 80 years after its discovery—by Richard Wolffenstein, who produced it by vacuum distillation.|$|E
25|$|The {{catalase}} test {{is one of}} {{the three}} main tests used by microbiologists to identify species of bacteria. If the bacteria possess catalase (i.e., are catalase-positive), when a small amount of bacterial isolate is added to <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> bubbles of oxygen are observed. The catalase test is done by placing a drop of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> on a microscope slide. An applicator stick is touched to the colony, and the tip is then smeared onto the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> drop.|$|E
25|$|A {{minor use}} is in contact lens hygiene – a few lens-cleaning {{products}} disinfect the lens using a <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> solution; a solution containing catalase is {{then used to}} decompose the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> before the lens is used again.|$|E
25|$|The use of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> as an oxidant {{would be}} advantageous, making the {{reaction}} more environmentally friendly {{as the sole}} byproduct is water. Benzeneseleninic acid derivatives as catalysts {{have been reported to}} give high selectivity with <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> as the oxidant.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> {{either in}} pure or diluted form, can pose several risks, the main one being that it forms {{explosive}} mixtures upon contact with organic compounds. Highly concentrated <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> itself is unstable {{and can cause}} a boiling liquid expanding vapour explosion (BLEVE) of the remaining liquid. Distillation of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> at normal pressures is thus highly dangerous. It is also corrosive, especially when concentrated, but even domestic-strength solutions can cause irritation to the eyes, mucous membranes and skin. Swallowing <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> solutions is particularly dangerous, as decomposition in the stomach releases large quantities of gas (10 times the volume of a 3% solution), leading to internal bloating. Inhaling over 10% can cause severe pulmonary irritation.|$|E
25|$|Gingivitis can be {{prevented}} through regular oral hygiene that includes daily brushing and flossing. <b>Hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> saline, alcohol or chlorhexidine mouth washes may also be employed. In a 2004 clinical study, the beneficial effect of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> on gingivitis has been highlighted.|$|E
25|$|Laboratory tests {{conducted}} by fish culturists {{in recent years}} have demonstrated that common household <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> can be used safely to provide oxygen for small fish. The <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> releases oxygen by decomposition when it is exposed to catalysts such as manganese dioxide.|$|E
25|$|Catalase {{is used in}} {{the food}} {{industry}} for removing <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> from milk prior to cheese production. Another use is in food wrappers where it prevents food from oxidizing. Catalase is also used in the textile industry, removing <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> from fabrics to make sure the material is peroxide-free.|$|E
25|$|A study {{published}} in Nature found that <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> {{plays a role in}} the immune system. Scientists found that <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> presence inside cells increased after tissues are damaged in zebrafish, which is thought to act as a signal to white blood cells to converge on the site and initiate the healing process. When the genes required to produce <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> were disabled, white blood cells did not accumulate at the site of damage. The experiments were conducted on fish; however, because fish are genetically similar to humans, the same process is speculated to occur in humans. The study in Nature suggested asthma sufferers have higher levels of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> in their lungs than healthy people, which could explain why asthma sufferers have inappropriate levels of white blood cells in their lungs.|$|E
25|$|The spray is {{produced}} from a reaction between two chemical compounds, hydroquinone and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide,</b> which {{are stored in}} two reservoirs in the beetle's abdomen. When the aqueous solution of hydroquinones and <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> reaches the vestibule, catalysts facilitate the decomposition of the <b>hydrogen</b> <b>peroxide</b> and the oxidation of the hydroquinone. Heat from the reaction brings the mixture to near the boiling point of water and produces gas that drives the ejection. The damage caused can be fatal to attacking insects. Some bombardier beetles can direct the spray {{over a wide range}} of directions.|$|E
