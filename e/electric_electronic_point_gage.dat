40|$|In flows around ships, the {{bow wave}} can entrain a {{significant}} amount of air as it breaks continuously on the free surface. The resulting air bubbles persist in the ship wake affecting its radar cross section as well as acting as cavitation nuclei in the flow entering the ship's propeller. In the present investigation, the formation of a bow wave on a ship was simulated in the laboratory using a deflecting plate in a supercritical free surface flow. The experiments were conducted at two scales. The present paper focuses on how the bow wave changes with the angles and flow parameters, information which is a necessary prerequisite for understanding the air entrainment process. Flow visualization studies were performed and an <b>electronic</b> <b>point</b> <b>gage</b> was used to study the three-dimensional shape of the bow waves {{and the manner in which}} they break...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the impact of output and {{employment}} generation due to fluctuations in net trade for <b>electric</b> and <b>electronic</b> products during the period 1991 – 2001. The results show the significant contribution of <b>electric</b> and <b>electronic</b> industry not only for the Malaysian GDP, export, and employment, but also for its inter-industrial relationship in the manufacturing sectors. Decreased net trade for <b>electric</b> and <b>electronic</b> products have resulted in declining output and employment generation especially in 1994 and 2000. This paper also attempts to present the impact on various categories of workers based on the skill levels due to the decline in the net trade for <b>electric</b> and <b>electronic</b> products. The results demonstrate that skilled workers are the most affected category, which is due to the high intensity level of skilled workers in this sector...|$|R

30|$|The PL {{emission}} of metal oxides usually has various origins like intrinsic <b>electronic</b> <b>point</b> defects.

In the case of different light-emitting point defects, the PL emission regarding each defect type {{will contribute to the}} whole emission spectrum through a Gaussian-like peak. Gaussian fitting analyzes these contributions and assists us to identify different <b>electronic</b> <b>point</b> defects which arise in the PAAO membranes.|$|R
