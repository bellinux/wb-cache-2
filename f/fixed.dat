5|$|An implant {{supported}} bridge (or <b>fixed</b> denture) is a {{group of}} teeth secured to dental implants so the prosthetic cannot be removed by the user. Bridges typically connect to more than one implant and may also connect to teeth as anchor points. Typically the number of teeth will outnumber the anchor points with the teeth that are directly over the implants referred to as abutments and those between abutments referred to as pontics. Implant supported bridges attach to implant abutments {{in the same way as}} a single tooth implant replacement. A <b>fixed</b> bridge may replace as few as two teeth (also known as a <b>fixed</b> partial denture) and may extend to replace an entire arch of teeth (also known as a <b>fixed</b> full denture). In both cases, the prosthesis is said to be <b>fixed</b> because it cannot be removed by the denture wearer.|$|E

50|$|Using <b>fix</b> {{templates}} is {{an alternative}} way to generate candidate patches. Fixtemplates are typically predefined program mutation rules for <b>fixing</b> specific classes ofbugs.

40|$|Software has bugs, and <b>fixing</b> those bugs {{pervades the}} {{software}} engineering process. It is folklore that bug <b>fixes</b> are often buggy themselves, resulting in bad <b>fixes,</b> either failing to <b>fix</b> a bug or creating new bugs. To confirm this folklore, we explored bug databases of the Ant, AspectJ, and Rhino projects, {{and found that}} bad <b>fixes</b> comprise as much as 9 % of all bugs. Thus, detecting and correcting bad <b>fixes</b> is important for improving the quality and reliability of software. However, no prior work has systematically considered this bad <b>fix</b> problem, which this paper introduces and formalizes. In particular, the paper formalizes two criteria {{to determine whether a}} <b>fix</b> resolves a bug: coverage and disruption. The coverage of a <b>fix</b> measures {{the extent to which the}} <b>fix</b> correctly handles all inputs that may trigger a bug, while disruption measures the deviations from the program’s intended behavior after the application of a <b>fix.</b> This paper also introduces a novel notion of distance-bounded weakest precondition as the basis for the developed practical techniques to compute the coverage and disruption of a <b>fix.</b> To validate our approach, we implemented FIXATION, a prototype that automatically detects bad <b>fixes</b> for Java programs. When it detects a bad <b>fix,</b> FIXATION returns an input that still triggers the bug or reports a newly introduced bug. Programmers can then use that bug-triggering input to refine or reformulate their <b>fix.</b> We manually extracted <b>fixes</b> drawn from real-world projects and evaluated FIXATION against them: FIXATION successfully detected the extracted bad <b>fixes...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Fixing bugs is an {{important}} activity of the soft-ware development process. A typical process of bug <b>fixing</b> consists of the following steps: 1) a user files a bug report; 2) the bug is assigned to a developer; 3) the developer <b>fixes</b> the bug; 4) changed code is reviewed and verified; and 5) the bug is resolved. Many studies have investigated the process of bug <b>fixing.</b> However, {{to the best of}} our knowledge, none has explicitly analyzed the interval between bug assignment and the time when bug <b>fixing</b> starts. After a bug assignment, some developers will immediately start <b>fixing</b> the bug while others will start bug <b>fixing</b> after a long period. We are blind on developer’s delays when <b>fixing</b> bugs. This paper explores such delays of developers through an empirical study on three open source software systems. We examine factors affecting bug <b>fixing</b> time along three dimensions: bug reports, source code involved in the <b>fix,</b> and code changes that are required to <b>fix</b> the bug. We further compare different factors by descriptive logistic regression models. Our results can help development teams better understand factors behind delays, and then improve bug <b>fixing</b> process.
