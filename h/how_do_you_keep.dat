5000|$|<b>How</b> <b>Do</b> <b>You</b> <b>Keep</b> the Music Playing? is {{an album}} by American pop singer Johnny Mathis that was {{released}} in May 1993 by Columbia Records and included the subtitle The Songs of Michel Legrand and Alan & Marilyn Bergman on its cover. The album featured new, individual recordings of two songs that Mathis covered as a medley for his 1973 album Me and Mrs. Jones -- [...] "I Was Born in Love with You" [...] and [...] "Summer Me, Winter Me". He also performed new arrangements of [...] "The Windmills of Your Mind", [...] "What Are You Doing the Rest of Your Life?", [...] and [...] "The Summer Knows", which he had recorded for other albums many years earlier.|$|E
5000|$|Rhetorical {{questions}} {{are often used}} {{as a metaphor for}} a question already asked. Examples may be found in the song Maria from the 1959 Rodgers and Hammerstein musical, The Sound of Music, in which the How do you solve a problem like Maria? is repeatedly answered with another question: How do you catch a cloud and pin it down?, <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> a wave upon the sand? and How do you hold a moonbeam in your hand? These responses may be taken as asserting that [...] "the problem of Maria" [...] cannot be solved; and furthermore the choice of cloud, wave and moonbeam as metaphors for Maria give insight into her character {{and the nature of the}} problem.|$|E

30|$|The {{responses}} to My Blue Book were similar. There {{was only one}} real difficulty in translation, that being of the sentence “The provision store is blue”. The participants {{could see that the}} establishment depicted was what they would call a duka (shop, but always a small one, not a supermarket). However, they {{did not know what to}} do with the word provision. In the end, they opted to use duka alone. There were some difficulties in understanding the pictures, especially one of blue fishing nets with breaking waves behind them. In landlocked Uganda, none of the participants had seen such waves, and fishing nets in Uganda are always brown. Most of the comments arose, though, out of the participants’ relating the pictures to their own experience: the little girl in the “I like blue” page looked like the daughter of someone they knew; the uniforms shown in “The uniforms are blue and white” looked like the uniforms of a neighbouring school—but <b>how</b> <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> the white clean? In short, the exercise did not give rise to debate about linguistic issues, but it did stimulate imaginative responses and encouraged the participants to see themselves and their own lives in the books.|$|R

And since it’s early in the morning we will be in good condition. Judy has described the background, her family background and early background in detail, so we will begin with the second question, which asks for her to select the experiences that were most important in her intellectual development. Judy, what were the early adult experiences? Which ones were important to you? I thought it was early, but I guess it’s early adult. Rosenblith: I think that, probably, the most important early adult experiences were: being denied candidacy for the Ph. D. at UCLA, which is described in more detail in section one; being a married graduate student with two children under three and ending up at Harvard with a trunk full of data, relevant to Allport’s work; having both a very successful and very traumatic experience at Harvard, where my first try for getting a degree went awry, partly over relationships with Allport; and later returning to Harvard under the aegis of Bob Sears, although just at the time he was leaving. The people I had contact with at Harvard, as professors were certainly extremely important to my intellectual development. Bob Sears is clearly the most important of them.

5000|$|The film's theme song, [...] "How Do You Keep the Music Playing?", was {{composed}} by Michel Legrand with lyrics by Alan and Marilyn Bergman.

Hope & Other Casualties was voted the number one album of 2006 by WUMB radio member listeners.|$|E

The {{shot at the}} European belt was unexpected following the surprise vacating of the title by previous holder Matthew Macklin who had hopes of pursuing World title ambitions. [...] The fight against Belghecham, the reigning French and EU champion, {{proved to be the}} toughest of his career so far with the Frenchman pushing Barker all the way. [...] Barker, now the holder of three championship belts, decided to vacate the Commonwealth title and set his sights upon defending the British and European belts against Matthew Macklin, whose world title ambitions did not materialise, later in the year in an eagerly anticipated fight dubbed the 'Battle of Britain'. The fight was {{to be one of the}} showcases of Frank Warrens 'Magnificent Seven' boxing event to be shown live on SKY PPV on 18 September 2010. [...] The fight however had to be called off following the re-occurrence of a hip injury whilst sparring for the contest meaning that Barker had to pull out of the contest and relinquish the title. Barkers trainer Tony Sims said of the decision to pull him out of the fight [...] "Everyone knows he had a hip operation a few months back and the day before yesterday (31 August 2010) he broke down for a second time. A few weeks ago is when it first happened I gave him five days off, but it went again this week midway through when he was sparring Danny Cadman...He asked for a few more days off but <b>how</b> long <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>keep</b> <b>doing</b> that for?."

'Why, sir,' said he, 'don't their parents teach them not to steal?' And I grew all over in a cold sweat, and I told him 'I was afeard they didn't.'
