50|$|Active <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> {{are those}} that are still {{evolving}} and growing. During each year, a layer of ice will be added if cracking occurs, but cracking need not occur every year to be considered active. The area in which most <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> remain active is along the permafrost zone. The number of active <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> that are cracking yearly is consistently declining as they become inactive.|$|R
50|$|Ice has 10 percent greater volume than water, so it {{continues}} to exert pressure on the ground. Thermal expansion and contraction can cause cracks to develop in the permafrost. During the thaw season in the freeze-thaw cycle, water gets into the cracks and forms veins of <b>ice</b> called <b>ice</b> <b>wedges.</b> <b>Ice</b> <b>wedges</b> enlarge with successive seasons of freezing and thawing. Some <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> that have been buried for centuries are revealed during excavations or landslides.|$|R

50|$|An <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> is a {{crack in}} the ground formed by a narrow or thin piece of ice that {{measures}} up to 3-4 meters in length at ground level and extends downwards into the ground up to several meters. During the winter months, the water in the ground freezes and expands. Once temperatures reach −17 degrees Celsius or lower, the ice that has already formed acts like a solid and expands to form cracks in the surface known as ice wedges. As this process continues over many years ice wedges can grow, up {{to the size of a}} swimming pool. Ice wedges usually appear in a polygonal pattern known as <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> polygons. The cracks can also be filled with materials other than ice, especially sand, and then they're called sand wedges.|$|E
50|$|In {{areas of}} past permafrost, ice wedges have melted and {{are no longer}} filled with ice. The wedge, which is now empty, is filled with {{sediment}} and dirt from the surrounding walls. These are called <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> casts and are used to estimate the climate {{of hundreds of thousands}} of years ago.|$|E
40|$|Late Quaternary {{permafrost}} deposits on Big Lyakhovsky Island (New Siberian Islands, Russian Arctic) {{were studied}} {{with the aim}} of reconstructing the palaeoclimatic and palaeoenvironmental conditions of northern Siberia. Hydrogen and oxygen stable isotope analyses are presented for six different generations of <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> as well as for recent <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> and precipitation. An age of about 200 ka BP was determined for an autochtonous peat layer in ice-rich deposits by U/Th method, containing the oldest <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> ever analysed for hydrogen and oxygen isotopes. The palaeoclimatic reconstruction revealed a period of severe winter temperatures at that time. After a gap in the sedimentation history of several tens of thousands of years, ice-wedge growth was re-initiated around 50 ka BP by a short period of extremely cold winters and rapid sedimentation leading to ice-wedge burial and characteristic ice-soil wedges ('polosatics'). This corresponds to the initial stage for the Late Weichselian Ice Complex, a peculiar cryolithogenic periglacial formation typical of the lowlands of northern Siberia. The <b>Ice</b> Complex <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> reflect cold winters and similar climatic conditions as around 200 ka BP. With a sharp rise in d 18 O of 6 per mil and dD of 40 per mil, the warming trend between Pleistocene and Holocene <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> is documented. Stable isotope data of recent <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> show that Big Lyakhovsky Island has never been as warm in winter as today...|$|R
40|$|The {{first step}} for the {{application}} of stable isotope analyses of <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> for the correct paleoclimatic reconstruction supposes the study of the isotopic composition of modern <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> and their relationship with the isotopic composition of modern precipitation. The purpose of this research is to present, to analyze and to discuss new data on isotopic composition (d 18 O, dD, 3 H) of modern <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> obtained in the Laptev Sea region in 1998 - 99. Investigations were carried out at two sites: on Bykovsky Peninsula in 1998 and on Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island in 1999 and were based on the combined application of both tritium CH) and stable isotope (d 18 O, dD) analyses. Tritium analyses of the atmospheric precipitation collected during two field seasons show seasonal variations: high tritium concentration in snow (to a maximum of 207 TU) and low values of tritium concentration (< 20 TU) in rain. High tritium concentrations are also observed in the surface water, in suprapermafrost ground waters, and in the upper part of permafrost. High tritium concentrations range between 30 - 40 TU and 750 TU in the studied modern <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> (active <b>ice</b> <b>wedges),</b> which let us believe that they are of modern growth. Such high tritium concentrations in <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> can not be associated with old thermonuclear tritium because of the radioactive decay. High tritium concentrations found in the snow cover in 1998 / 99, in the active layer and in the upper part of permafrost give evidence of modern (probably the last decade) technogenic tritium arrival from the atmosphere on to the Earth surface in the region. The comparison of the isotopic composition (d 18 O, dD and d-excess) of active <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> and modern winter precipitation in both sites shows: 1) the isotopic composition of snow correlates linearly with a slope close to 8. 0 and parallel to the GMWL at both sites; 2) the mean isotopic composition of active <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> on Bykovsky Peninsula is in good agreement with the mean isotopic composition of modern snow; 3) the isotopic composition of active <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> and snow on Bol'shoy Lyakhovsky Island are considerably different. There are low values of d-excess in all studied active <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> (mean value is about 4. 8 per mil), while in snow, the mean value of d-excess is about 9. 5 per mil. Possible reasons for this gap are the following: 1) the modification of the isotopic composition in snow during the spring period; 2) changes in the isotopic composition of <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> due to the process of ice sublimation in open frost cracks during the cold period; 3) mixing of snowmelt water with different types of surface water during the spring period; 4) different moisture source regions...|$|R
40|$|The stable oxygen isotope {{composition}} of Late Holocene syngenetic <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> from the Erkutayakha River valley in the Yamal Peninsula {{and from the}} Adventdalen valley in Svalbard was studied.

Variations of δ 18 O values of the ice of both <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> do not exceed 2 - 3. 5 ‰. Based on the oxygen isotope variations is has been calculated that mean winter air temperatures did not change by more than 3 oC during the Late Holocene...|$|R
50|$|At many localities {{along the}} sea cliffs, {{typically}} over 10 meters of Early Weichselian lacustrine and loess-like floodplain deposits overlie the Eemian and pre-Eemian sediments.

40|$|During the 1998 - 1999, 2000 - 2001 and 2003 - 2004 field seasons, geomorphological {{surveys of}} permafrost-related polygons {{were carried out}} in {{northern}} Victoria Land. Widespread diffusion of <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> was ascertained. The <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> were found at depths ranging from 10 cm to 74 cm from the ground surface.

50|$|Elsewhere {{along the}} coast of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island, the sea cliffs expose pre-Eemian {{floodplain}} and lake sediments at their base. Eemian lake sediments fill depressions, i.e. <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> casts and thermokarst lakes, which developed by the surficial thawing during Eemian interglacial climates of Saalian ice-wedges and other permafrost. In some locations, the Eemian lake deposits are thicker and laterally continuous enough to form a complete blanket overlying older sediments. The Eemian sediments contain fossils indicative of an interglacial environment.|$|E
50|$|The Dry Valleys are {{so named}} because of their {{extremely}} low humidity and their lack of snow or ice cover. They are also dry because, in this location, the mountains are sufficiently high that they block seaward flowing ice from the East Antarctic ice sheet from reaching the Ross Sea. At 4800 km2, the valleys constitute around 0.03% of the continent, and form the largest ice-free region in Antarctica. The valley floors are covered with loose gravel, in which <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> polygonal patterned ground may be observed.|$|E
50|$|Tens of {{thousands}} of unusual clastic dikes (1 mm—350 cm wide, up to 50 m deep) penetrate sedimentary and bedrock units in the Columbia Basin of Washington, Oregon and Idaho. Their origin remains in question. The dikes {{may be related to}} loading by outburst floods. Other evidence suggests they are sediment-filled desiccation cracks (mudcracks). Some have suggested the dikes are <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> casts or features related to the melting of buried ice. Earthquake shaking and liquefaction is invoked by others to explain the dikes (i.e., sand blows).|$|E
40|$|Late Quaternary {{permafrost}} {{of northern}} latitudes contains large proportions of ground ice, including pore ice, segregation ice, massive ice, buried glacier ice {{and in particular}} <b>ice</b> <b>wedges.</b> Fossil ice-wedges are remnants of polygonal patterned ground in former tundra areas, which evolved over several {{tens of thousands of}} years in non-glaciated Beringia. <b>Ice</b> <b>wedges</b> originate from repeated frost cracking of the ground in winter and subsequent crack filling by snowmelt and re-freezing in the ground in spring. Hence, the stable water isotope composition (δ 18 O, δD, d excess) of <b>wedge</b> <b>ice</b> derives from winter precipitation and is commonly interpreted as wintertime climate proxy. Paleoclimate studies based on ice-wedge isotope data cover different timescales and periods of the late Quaternary. (MIS 6 to MIS 1). In the long-term scale the temporal resolution is rather low and corresponds to mid- and late Pleistocene and Holocene stratigraphic units. Recent progress has been made in developing centennial Late Glacial and Holocene time series of ice-wedge stable isotopes by applying radiocarbon dating of organic remains in <b>ice</b> samples. <b>Ice</b> <b>wedges</b> exposed at both coasts of the Dmitry Laptev Strait (East Siberian Sea) were studied to deduce winter climate conditions since about 200 kyr. <b>Ice</b> <b>wedges</b> aligned to distinct late Quaternary permafrost strata were studied for their isotopic composition and dated by radiocarbon ages of organic matter within the <b>wedge</b> <b>ice</b> or by cosmogenic nuclide ratios (36 Cl/Cl-) of the ice. The paleoclimate interpretation is furthermore based on geocryological and paleoecological proxy data and geochronological information (radiocarbon, luminescence, radioisotope disequilibria 230 Th/U) from ice-wedge embedding frozen deposits. Coldest winter conditions are mirrored by most negative δ 18 O mean values of - 37 ‰ and δD mean values of - 290 ‰ from <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> of the Last Glacial Maximum (26 to 22 kyr BP) while late Holocene (since about 4 kyr BP) and in particular modern <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> (last about 20 years) capture warmest winter conditions by δ 18 O mean values of - 25 and - 21 ‰ and δD mean values of - 192 ‰ and - 158 ‰, respectively. Further winter-climate variability on stadial-interstadial Quaternary scale is mirrored by the isotopic composition of related <b>ice</b> <b>wedges...</b>|$|R
40|$|From 1998 to 2006, during four summer field seasons, <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> {{were found}} in 45 sites at depths ranging from 10 to 74 cm beneath the ground surface. The tops of the <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> ranged from 5 to 155 cm wide, and their heights varied from 20 to over 150 cm in length. A co-isotopic study was {{performed}} by measuring both the oxygen (Delta 18 O) and hydrogen (Delta D) isotope compositions and the tritium activity. Petrofabric analyses were also performed on ice-wedge ice to investigate changes in fabric across wedges {{in relation to the}} growth mechanism. Data loggers were installed at three ice-wedge polygon sites to monitor the ice-wedge thermal regime. The measurements obtained for Delta 18 O and Delta D had extremely negative d- excess values, showing a strong divergence from the snowfalls expected to occur at the elevation of the sites. Sublimation processes were taken into account to define the origin of the ice-wedge ice. The presence of hoarfrost crystals, observed in the ice-wedge cracks during summer field surveys, corroborate that sublimation processes may control the formation of ice in the growth processes of <b>ice</b> <b>wedges.</b> Petrofabric analyses indicated the increasing of crystal size from the ice-wedge centre outward, and in c-axis directions they showed a rotation of crystals from the centre towards the sides. The monitoring of the thermal regime of three <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> over a five-year period highlighted that, in winter, extreme gradients between the temperatures at the ground surface and those at the tops of the <b>ice</b> <b>wedges</b> may trigger cracking. Moreover, the presence of open cracks in the <b>ice</b> <b>wedges,</b> in summer, indicates that the growth processes are still active under the present climatic conditions...|$|R

50|$|The thermal {{contraction}} theory states {{that during the}} winter months, {{thermal contraction}} cracks form only a few cm wide {{and a couple of}} metres deep because of the extreme cold weather. Over the next few months, the snow melts and the remaining water fills the cracks and the permafrost below the surface freezes it. These tiny cracks turn into permafrost. Once the summer months arrive, the permafrost expands; horizontal compression produces upturning of the frozen sediment by plastic deformation. The next winter the cold refreezes and cracks the already forming <b>ice</b> <b>wedge,</b> opening a way for the melting snow of spring to fill the empty crack. The mean annual air temperature thought needed to form ice wedges is −6° to −8°C or colder.|$|E

50|$|Where {{thermokarst}} depressions {{have formed}} by melting of the permafrost, they are filled by Holocene solifluction and lake sediments. These depressions formed {{as the result}} of the thawing of ice wedges and other permafrost during the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition about 12,000 to 10,000 years ago. Lacustrine sediments filling these depressions contain a record of the Allerød warming, Younger Dryas cooling, and other climatic events. Holocene fluvial and solifluction deposits underlie valleys of streams cut into underlying Pleistocene sediments. Solifluction deposits, which were created by melting of the underlying permafrost, veneer the surface of the uplands. New <b>ice</b> <b>wedge</b> polygon systems later formed in these sediments during the Late Holocene as result of pronounced climatic cooling, which only recently has reversed in the last couple of hundred years.|$|E
50|$|The oldest known Pleistocene sediments {{exposed in}} the {{southern}} sea cliffs of Bolshoy Lyakhovsky Island consist of Saalian sediments, which accumulated between 200,000 and 120,000 years ago. The lower part of these sediments consist of ice-rich, silty and silty-sandy sediments that accumulated as an Saalian ice complex between 200,000 and 170,000 years ago. They contain pebbles, peat inclusions, and peat horizons. The presence of ice belts, reticulated ice interlayers, and wide, round-shouldered ice wedges indicate that permafrost formed in these sediments as they accumulated. The lower part of this unit contains the pollen of sparse grass-sedge vegetation, which reflects a stadial environment. The upper part of this ice-rich unit contains pollen associated with dense grass-dominated tundra, which is indicative of interstadial environments. The {{upper part of the}} Saalian sediments, which lie uncomfortably on the eroded surface of the lower Saalian ice complex deposits, consists of well-sorted fine-grained sand that contains pollen characteristic of sparse grass-sedge dominated interstadial vegetation and less ground ice.
