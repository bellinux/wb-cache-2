500|$|Due to the father-son {{dynamics}} of the hunting world depicted in the series' first season with the Winchesters, the writers decided to explore a mother-daughter relationship. This resulted in {{the introduction of the}} character Jo Harvelle and her mother Ellen, though the Alex character was eventually renamed Jo. Tal had been a fan of the show, and decided to audition for the role. Since the character was not fully explored during her first few appearances on the show, Tal did not know what her personality would be. Because of the way Jo is introducedthreatening Dean with a rifleTal {{was under the impression that}} the character was an experienced hunter. With this in mind, she decided to portray her as [...] "somewhat confident and cool" [...] by making use of her experience in the Israeli army, where she served for two years. Tal commented, [...] "When I was in the army <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> my gun and feeling all dangerous and badass. It's an attitude, it's a different kind of walk, and the way you hold yourself, the way you look at things. I tried to put that in there because she didn't say much." ...|$|E
500|$|He {{earned his}} first cap for Northern Ireland in a 4–1 home defeat against Germany in a {{friendly}} on 4 June 2005, the Irish Football Association (IFA)'s 125th anniversary match. He came on {{as a substitute for}} Maik Taylor on 76 minutes, conceding one goal scored by Lukas Podolski. On reflection of this match, Ingham said [...] "The reaction of the crowd when I came on was amazing. To be honest <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> back the tears as I never thought I would get such a reception. I was the proudest man in the ground." [...] For this match, he was offered insurance by the IFA, due to him not yet being under contract at Wrexham. This appearance would result in a £30,000 payment for former club Cliftonville, which came {{as a part of the}} deal for Sunderland to sign him, but by August 2005 this had still to be received by the club. The Premier League was called into the situation by Cliftonville, as they had only received the first part of the payment after he made his first-team debut for Sunderland. Ingham himself was also due a £20,000 bonus for this appearance.|$|E
500|$|Although {{the band}} liked the demo, it was {{difficult}} for them to record the song. Bassist Adam Clayton said, [...] "At the time it sounded like a foreign language, whereas now we understand how it works". The arrangement, with two time signature shifts and frequent chord changes, was rehearsed many times, but the group struggled to get a performance they liked. According to co-producer Daniel Lanois, [...] "that was the science project song. I remember having this massive schoolhouse blackboard, as we call them. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> a pointer, like a college professor, walking the band through the chord changes like a fucking nerd. It was ridiculous." [...] Co-producer Brian Eno estimates that half of the album sessions were spent trying to record a suitable version of [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name". The band worked on a single take for weeks, but as Eno explained, that particular version had a lot of problems with it and the group continued trying to fix it up. Through all of their work, they had gradually replaced each instrument take until nothing remained from the original performance.|$|E

500|$|At the 2010 Commonwealth Games, Vijender Singh {{was beaten}} by England's Anthony Ogogo in the semi-finals. Leading 3–0 on points {{going into the}} final round, Singh was twice given a {{two-point}} penalty by Canadian referee Michael Summers, the second for coming just 20 seconds {{before the end of}} the bout, leading Ogogo to win by 4 points to 3. The Indian Boxing Federation (IBF) launched an unsuccessful appeal, leaving Singh with a bronze medal. IBF Secretary General P K Muralidharan Raja said, [...] "The jury reviewed the bout and came to the conclusion that Vijender was holding his opponent and the referee was right in warning him. When the Indian team pointed out that even Ogogo was holding Vijender, the jury felt it was not the case." [...] Singh lashed out saying that the penalties were [...] "harsh and unfair. The warnings were unfair and harsh. If the referee thought <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> Ogogo then he should have penalised this guy as well. He was also holding me. It's a joke that somebody has won by scoring points just out of warnings." [...] One month later, in November, he won the 2010 Asian Games shutting out Uzbek two time world champion Abbos Atoev 7:0 in the final.|$|E
2500|$|My brother, Buddy Wootten, also a bassist, {{called me}} from Atlanta {{to tell me}} he had just {{finished}} working the Fox Theater with Les Paul and Mary Ford. Mary also told me this later. This was while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> forth with Woody Herman Orchestra. So, later when I had married her sister (Eva), we worked with her other sister and Bob Summers (her brother) on guitar (sounds like Les Paul too) and Mary's other sister Carol. The gig was the Crescendo club {{right in the middle}} of Sunset Strip. A very hip joint! ...|$|E

His black 1957/63 (the body {{is from a}} '63; the neck from a '57) Stratocaster, {{previously}} owned by late Free guitarist Paul Kossoff, was used circa 1978–1990. It {{was used as a}} template by Fender to manufacture an Artist Signature model in 2009. The original now resides at his mother's home. [...] "I bought it in 1976," [...] he said. [...] "I saw it advertised in Melody Maker… I got the serial number to check it was [...] guitar. It cost quite a bit of money but I didn't care. I just sold everything I had so I could get it, and I used it from then on. It just felt like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> a piece of magic because he had used this guitar." ...|$|E

2500|$|The third {{series of}} The Catherine Tate Show aired in 2006, {{going on to}} win the National Television Award for most popular comedy as voted for by the public, and Tate's catchphrase [...] "bovvered", used by her {{character}} Lauren Cooper, became so influential in popular culture that it was named Word of the Year and was even poised to enter the Oxford English Dictionary. Tate also played the role of Donna Noble in Doctor Who, a woman in a wedding dress who suddenly appears in the TARDIS {{at the end of the}} episode [...] "Doomsday". The following episode, the Christmas special entitled [...] "The Runaway Bride", saw Tate's character in a major role, where she was temporarily the Doctor's companion. On her appearance in the series, Tate commented [...] "I'm honoured and delighted to be joining David Tennant aboard the TARDIS. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> out for a summer season at Wigan rep but as a summer job, this'll do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mahaffey {{also stated}} that after the murder of Virgil Starks, the police made the {{farmhouse}} off limits to everybody. [...] "Several nights later, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>holding</b> forth in the Arkansas police station when a call came through that a neighbor had seen strange lights in the farmhouse. We sped to the scene and I hid behind a car while Police Chief Max Tackett and three other patrolmen approached the house. Chief Tackett yelled into the house that the place was surrounded and the Phantom might as well give up. Who do you suppose walked out? None other than Lone Wolf Gonzaullas of the Texas Rangers and a woman photographer from Life and Time magazines. Lone Wolf explained rather sheepishly {{that he had been}} re-enacting the crime and the young lady was taking pictures of him. Police Chief Tackett turned to me and shouted {{at the top of his}} voice, 'Mahaffey, you can quote me as saying that the Phantom Murders will never be solved until Texarkana gets rid of the big city press and the Texas Rangers.'" ...|$|E
