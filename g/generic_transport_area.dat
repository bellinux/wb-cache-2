40|$|This paper {{presents}} a modified numerical continuation approach for predicting the bifurcation behaviour of aeroelastic systems undergoing aperiodic limit cycles oscillations. Such oscillations can occur {{due to a}} number of nonlinear functions. Here, backlash nonlinearity in the aileron stiffness for a <b>Generic</b> <b>Transport</b> Aircraft is considered. It is shown that classical numerical continuation will fail due to the aperiodic nature of the limit cycles and the inability to perform period scaling and phase fixing. An alternative, approximate numerical continuation method is proposed, based on longer numerical integration sequences and a heuristic method for determining the period of the limit cycle oscillations. The approach is applied successfully to a simulated aeroelastic model of the <b>Generic</b> <b>Transport</b> Aircraft with backlash...|$|R

40|$|Fault {{detection}} and isolation (FDI) filters are typically synthesized for open-loop or closed-loop systems. The controller affects the FDI filter {{performance in the}} closed-loop system. FDI filter performance and closed-loop controller-filter interaction {{in the presence of}} uncertain dynamics were investigated as was the role of controller robustness on the FDI filter performance. The NASA <b>Generic</b> <b>Transport</b> Model aircraft was considered as a motivating application. Multiple example scenarios were presented to highlight the utility of FDI filter performance metrics. For example, comparing fault detection performance of different filters under identical uncertain plant dynamics and controller, the effect of different controllers on the FDI filter performance, and the effect of model uncertainty on filter performance. The <b>Generic</b> <b>Transport</b> Model aircraft FDI filter results are validated using worst-case analysis and linear simulations. Copyright © 2011 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R

40|$|Ease of {{deployment}} {{has always}} {{been seen as a}} major selling point of wireless sensor networks, yet experience has shown deployment to be difficult. We argue that parts of these difficulties have come from the lack of a generic networking layer and of well-tested, <b>generic</b> <b>transport</b> protocols in traditional sensornet deployments. We believe that the use of low-power IPv 6 can help by providing nodelevel addressing, point-to-point routing, and <b>generic</b> well-tested <b>transport</b> protocols. We evaluate the performance of HTTP/TCP and CoAP/UDP over a duty cycled radio layer, showing that with a small modification to the duty cycling layer results in a dramatic improvement in performance at a retained low power consumption. Based on our experiences, we introduce an in-network caching mechanism that significantly improves the performance of software updates in incrementally deployed sensor networks. Our results are the first steps towards a deployment tool for IP-based sensor networks. 1...|$|R
