5|$|Adult {{cartoonist}} Antonucci conceived Ed, Edd n Eddy {{while working}} on a commercial design. Antonucci pitched the series to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon. Both studios {{were interested in the}} series, but each demanded creative control and Antonucci refused. Cartoon Network ended up commissioning the show after agreeing to let Antonucci <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the show. After its debut, the series was a success in Nielsen ratings, popular among younger and older viewers. Met with generally positive reviews, the season earned Antonucci a Reuben Award for Best Television Animation.|$|E
5|$|If Offa did {{not gain}} the {{advantage}} in Wessex until defeating Cynewulf in 779, {{it may be}} that his successes south of the river were a necessary prerequisite to his interventions in the southeast. In this view, Egbert of Kent's death in about 784 and Cynewulf's death in 786 were the events that allowed Offa to gain control of Kent and bring Beorhtric into his sphere of influence. This version of events also assumes that Offa did not <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> Kent after 764â€“65, as some historians believe.|$|E
5|$|On a dare, Antonucci {{then decided}} that he would try {{producing}} a children's animated series of his own. While designing a commercial, he ended up drawing three characters that he felt particularly pleased with. Growing excited over their potential, he named them Ed, Edd, and Eddy and spent the following months developing a show around them. He faxed a one-page concept sheet to Cartoon Network and Nickelodeon in 1996. Both studios quickly responded, Cartoon Network in only 20 minutes, and were enthusiastic and wanted to see more; they each demanded creative control, however, and Antonucci refused. After Cartoon Network agreed to let Antonucci <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the show, conversations between Antonucci and the studio continued.|$|E

5|$|During the game, players {{describe}} their PC's intended actions, such as punching an opponent or picking a lock, and converse with the DM, who then describes the result or response. Trivial actions, such as {{picking up a}} letter or opening an unlocked door, are usually automatically successful. The outcomes of more complex or risky actions are determined by rolling dice. Factors contributing to the outcome include the character's ability scores, skills {{and the difficulty of}} the task. In circumstances where a character does not <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> an event, such as when a trap or magical effect is triggered or a spell is cast, a saving throw can be used to determine whether the resulting damage is reduced or avoided. In this case the odds of success are influenced by the character's class, levels and ability scores.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, in {{collaboration}} with numerous companies, Microsoft created a home computer system, MSX, which contained {{its own version of}} the DOS operating system, called MSX-DOS; this became relatively popular in Japan, Europe and South America. Later, the market saw a flood of IBM PC clones after Columbia Data Products successfully cloned the IBM BIOS, quickly followed by Eagle Computer and Compaq. The deal with IBM allowed Microsoft to <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> its own QDOS derivative, MS-DOS, and through aggressive marketing of the operating system to manufacturers of IBM-PC clones Microsoft rose from a small player to one of the major software vendors in the home computer industry. With the release of the Microsoft Mouse on May 2, 1983, Microsoft continued to expand its product line in other markets. This expansion included Microsoft Press, a book publishing division, on July 11 the same year, which debuted with two titles: Exploring the IBM PCjr Home Computer by Peter Norton, and The Apple Macintosh Book by Cary Lu.|$|E

25|$|As Confederate {{command and}} control was {{reestablished}} for the pursuit, the men ran into a third Union force, under General William Emory, about 5,800 men sitting atop a ridge overlooking Chatman's Bayou. The Confederates pushed forward, but Emory's division repulsed attempts to take this location. However, the Union forces did not <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the precious water in the bayou.

25|$|Emerging {{with control}} {{over most of}} {{mainland}} China after the Chinese Civil War, the People's Republic of China incorporated Tibet in 1950 and negotiated the Seventeen Point Agreement with the newly enthroned 14th Dalai Lama's government, affirming the People's Republic of China's sovereignty but granting the area autonomy. Subsequently, on his journey into exile, the 14th Dalai Lama completely repudiated the agreement, which he has repeated on many occasions. The Chinese used the Dalai Lama {{to be able to}} <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the military's training and actions.|$|E

25|$|Commercial {{exploitation}} {{began in}} 1872, {{and by the}} beginning of the 20th century the Baku oil fields were the largest in the world. Towards the end of the 20th century much of the onshore petroleum had been exhausted, and drilling had extended into the sea offshore. By the end of the 19th century skilled workers and specialists flocked to Baku. By 1900 the city had more than 3,000 oil wells, of which 2,000 were producing oil at industrial levels. Baku ranked as one of the largest centres for the production of oil industry equipment before World War II. The World War II Battle of Stalingrad was fought to determine who would <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the Baku oil fields. Fifty years before the battle, Baku produced half of the world's oil supply.|$|E
25|$|Between 1035 and 1814, the Faroes {{were part}} of the Hereditary Kingdom of Norway. In 1814, the Treaty of Kiel granted Denmark control over the islands, along with two other Norwegian island possessions: Greenland and Iceland. The Faroe Islands have been a self-governing country within the Kingdom of Denmark since 1948. The Faroese <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> most {{domestic}} matters. Areas that remain the responsibility of Denmark include military defence, the police department, the justice department, currency and foreign affairs. However, as they {{are not part of the}} same customs area as Denmark, the Faroe Islands have an independent trade policy and can establish trade agreements with other states. The islands also have representation in the Nordic Council as members of the Danish delegation. The people of the Faroe Islands also compete as a national team in certain sports.|$|E

25|$|Southwest Airlines {{was founded}} after the {{agreement}} between the airlines and cities to relocate to DFW and was not {{a party to the}} agreement, and felt that their business model would be affected by a long drive to the new airport. Before DFW's opening, Southwest filed suit to remain at Love Field, claiming that no legal basis existed to close the airport to commercial service and that they were not bound by an agreement they did not sign. In 1973, a Federal District Court ruled that, so long as Love Field remained open, the City of Dallas could not preclude Southwest from operating there. The ruling was in the regulated environment where the CAB did not <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> travel within a state, the only service Southwest then offered.|$|E
25|$|For {{most of the}} post-World War II era, Republicans {{had little}} {{presence}} at the state legislative level. This trend began to reverse in the late 1990s, with Republicans increasing their state legislative presence and taking control of state legislatures in the south, which had begun to vote for Republican presidential candidates decades earlier but had retained Democrats in the legislatures. From 2004 to 2014, the Republican State Leadership Committee (RSLC) raised over $140 million targeted to state legislature races while the Democratic Legislative Campaign Committee (DLSC) raised {{less than half that}} during that time period. Following the 2014 midterm elections, Republicans control 68 of 98 partisan state legislative houses, the most in the party's history, and <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> both the governorship and state legislatures in 24 states, as opposed to only 7 states with Democratic governors and state legislatures. According to a January 2015 poll by Pew Research, 41% of Americans view the Republicans favorably while 46% view the Democrats favorably.|$|E
25|$|From the beginning, {{there were}} {{tensions}} {{between those who}} wanted to use the rivers for navigation and {{those who wanted to}} use them for drainage, to the extent that when Denver Sluice was demolished by an extremely high tide in 1713, the towns of Cambridge and Thetford petitioned against its reconstruction. However, a more serious problem for the Burnt Fen area was the steady shrinkage of the land surface as the water was removed from the peat soils, and the blowing away of the light soil as it dried out. Water could no longer flow by gravity from the land into the rivers. Although the Bedford Level Corporation was responsible for the main rivers in the region, they did not <b>have</b> <b>control</b> <b>of</b> the smaller tributaries. Landowners could and did build windmills to act as drainage engines, but there was no overall policy, with the result that there were legal disputes, with one landowner complaining that a neighbour's drainage mill resulted in flooding of surrounding properties.|$|E
