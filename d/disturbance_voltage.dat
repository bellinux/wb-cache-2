The step-down transformer transfers the medium-voltage to U 1, {{which is the}} working voltage of the back-to-back converter, and the converter outputs the desired <b>disturbance</b> <b>voltage</b> waveform according to the modulation wave signal. The step-up transformer then transfers the low voltage level <b>disturbance</b> <b>voltage</b> to the medium-voltage level.

Because of the back-to-back converter, the wind turbine is completely isolated from network, and so the disturbances cannot affect the voltage at the grid access point.

A method using both <b>disturbance</b> <b>voltage</b> and current probes is useful {{because it does not}} require any impedance stabilization networks (ISNs).

An experiment using a simple circuit model presents that the value obtained by using this method is lower than that by using ISNs in some cases. A theoretical analysis however derives that the estimated value by adding the margin to the measured value is always guaranteed to be large compared with the value measured by ISNs. The analysis also indicates that the margin is dependent on the deviation of phase angle of ISN and can be calculated by a simple equation. The experiment using actual equipment shows that the estimated results including the margin is always larger than those measured by ISNs. The results of the study show that the method using both <b>disturbance</b> <b>voltage</b> and current probes can be used for measuring the disturbances by taking the margin into account, and this margin can be reduced by improving the phase angle characteristics of the common mode impedance of ISNs...|$|E

40|$|Abstract:- In {{the medium}} and high power range (starting from about 5 kW) mostly {{three-phase}} Solar inverter systems are used.

Its frequency is at least switching frequency and its rate of rise depends on the switching speed of the power semiconductors used. The required switching frequency for low distortion input currents and the resulting switching speed of modern semiconductors lead to excessive earth currents. Especially big solar fields show a considerable ground (earth) capacitance leading to problematic leakage current in DC-slink side. Both countermeasures, the reduction and the short connection of the parasitic earth capacitances (as well as the insertion of a differential inductor in both cases) lead to non trivial resonance problems.
