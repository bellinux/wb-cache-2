The opening movement is based on a verse from Psalm 139; the closing chorale on a stanza from Johann Heermann's hymn [...] "".

40|$|Abstract: In this paper, a novel motion texture {{approach}} is presented for synthesizing long character motion (e. g., kungfu) {{that is similar}} to the original short input motion. First, a new motion with repeated frames is generated by exploiting the symmetric properties of the frames and reversing the motion sequence playback in a given motion sequence. Then, the order of the above motion sequence is rearranged by putting the start and the <b>end</b> <b>frames</b> together. The graphcut algorithm is used to seamlessly synthesize the transition between the start and the <b>end</b> <b>frames,</b> which is noted as graphcut-based motion-texton. Finally, we utilize the motion-textons to synthesize long motion texture, which can be patched together like the image texture synthesis method using graphcut algorithm, and automatically form a long motion texture endlessly. Our {{approach is}} demonstrated by synthesizing the long kungfu motion texture without visual artifacts, together with post-processing including our new developed graphcut-based motion blending and Poisson-based motion smoothing techniques...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a method for {{tracking}} a video object in an ordered sequence of two-dimensional images, where the outcome is the trajectory of the video object throughout the time sequence of images. This method is designed to run in real-time in a synchronous video collaboration environment, and used for producing dynamic object annotations for enhanced video content understanding. A dynamic object is an object whose location or size in the video frame constantly changes due to the camera motion, the motion of its own, or both. We suggest a novel method for #nding the trajectory of the object in the intermediate frames given the locations and shapes of the object in two <b>end</b> <b>frames.</b> In addition to the shape and location information of the object, its texture information in the <b>end</b> <b>frames</b> is used to predict the location and search space of it in the intermediate frames.

40|$|The {{realistic}} {{strength and}} deflection behavior {{of industrial and}} commercial steel portal frame buildings are understood only if the effects of rigidity of <b>end</b> <b>frames</b> and profiled steel claddings are included. The conventional designs ignore these effects and are very much based on idealized two-dimensional (2 D) frame behavior. Full-scale tests of a 1212 m steel portal frame building under a range of design load cases indicated that the observed deflections and bending moments in the portal frame were considerably different from those obtained from a 2 D analysis of frames ignoring these effects. Three-dimensional (3 D) analyses of the same building, including the effects of <b>end</b> <b>frames</b> and cladding, were carried out, and the results agreed well with full-scale test results. Results clearly indicated {{the need for such}} an analysis and for testing to study the true behavior of steel portal frame buildings. It is expected that such a 3 D analysis will lead to lighter steel frames as the maximum moments and deflections are reduced...|$|R

50|$|HDLC frames can be {{transmitted}} over synchronous or asynchronous serial communication links. Those links have no mechanism to mark the beginning or <b>end</b> of a <b>frame,</b> so the beginning and <b>end</b> of each <b>frame</b> has to be identified.

This sequence is '01111110', or, in hexadecimal notation, 0x7E. Each <b>frame</b> begins and <b>ends</b> with a <b>frame</b> delimiter. A frame delimiter at the <b>end</b> of a <b>frame</b> may also mark the start of the next frame. A sequence of 7 or more consecutive 1-bits within a frame will cause the frame to be aborted.|$|R

In order to minimize the transverse girder stiffness and maximize the allowable drift in the ends of the girders they are designed with no shear studs in the regions directly above the supports, and bearings which can accommodate relatively large rotations. Minimum and maximum bi-linear properties are used during analysis of a bridge with ductil...|$|R
