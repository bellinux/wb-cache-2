40|$|The {{construction}} of water management and navigation structures often requires temporary works to exclude water to facilitate {{construction in the}} dry or at least under a lower water level within the construction area. The use of cellular cofferdams for both temporary and permanent earth/water retaining works is very common. A number of theories are presented that describe the failure mechanisms involved. These failure mechanisms were identified from model studies on circular type cofferdams are applied independent of cofferdam geometry. It is common to use <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cofferdams. To asses the validity of common failure mechanisms associated with cellular cofferdams when applied to <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cofferdams, a series of numerical modelling analyses were conducted. These were validated using field monitoring results of a large scale <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cofferdam constructed at St. Germans, Norfolk, UK. A series of plane strain analyses of a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cofferdam were conducted using the geometry from a critical section of cofferdam. These analyses identified the lowest factor of safety based on the drained strength of the clay on which the cofferdam was constructed. The water level within the river was increased to accommodate flooding and soil strength was reduced to identify the general failure mechanism. The structural forces were calculated using both 2 D and 3 D models for a larger width section (13 m wide) to allow comparison with wall bending moments and displacements measured in field. The 3 D analyses used actual tie spacing and membrane effects whilst reducing the lateral stiffness of the wall to accommodate the stiffness reduction due to variation in the interlock forces. To measure the bending moment in sheet piles, resistance type strain gauges were installed on a 13 m wide section of cofferdam. The cell deflection, river and cell water levels were also monitored to identify tidal river effect {{and the influence of}} cell water level on performance. Comparison of field and numerical results highlighted a number of important design and construction detail related to <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> cellular cofferdams.

Here an analysis is carried out by varying the dimensions of two different diaphragm geometries, namely conventional square <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and cross-sectional beam <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> The analysis is done using finite element method (FEM) technique in ANSYS software and by comparing the results, the better <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> is chosen for the required pressure range of the application for flash flood level measurement.

40|$|Monitoring {{pressure}} plays a {{vital role}} in automotive safety applications. This paper reports on the deformation analysis of a <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> pressure sensor. There are two kinds of <b>diaphragms,</b> square <b>type</b> and circular type have been considered for the analysis. In this sense, diaphragms with equivalent cross sectional area have been selected for the simplicity. The proposed diaphragms has been simulated to get maximum deformation for an input pressure by using COMSOL and it is compared with the theoretical analysis. In addition, stress analysis along the mid line of the square type and circular type membranes also has been obtained by using FEM simulation. Based on the deformation, circular <b>type</b> <b>diaphragm</b> is preferable than square type. Even though, the design layout costs more in fabricating circular diaphragms which indeed increases the cost of the sensor and the fabrication costs are higher compared to the square shaped diaphragm...|$|R

25|$|The {{mechanism}} {{inside the}} first stage can be of the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> or the piston type. Both types can be balanced or unbalanced. Unbalanced regulators have the cylinder pressure pushing {{the first stage}} upstream valve closed, which is opposed by the intermediate stage pressure and a spring. As cylinder pressure falls the closing force is less, so the regulated pressure increases at lower tank pressure. To keep this pressure rise within acceptable limits the high-pressure orifice size is limited, but this decreases the total flow capacity of the regulator.

Stiction is a common problem in spring <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> valves, which are widely used in the process industry. This behavior leads control valves to deliver accurate feed and thereby allowing wastage of utility.

The paper presents an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy methodology for identification of stiction. For a vertical two tank level process with Kano’s model of stiction is considered to obtain necessary required data to formulate objective function.

40|$|Many older {{transmission}} towers {{are designed}} based on tension-only bracing systems with slender diagonal members. However, the increased demand in power supply and changing global weather patterns mean that these towers require upgrading {{to carry the}} resultant heavier loading. The failure of a single tower can rapidly propagate along the line and result in severe damage that costs many millions of dollars. Hence, this research project is aimed at developing efficient upgrading schemes using diaphragm bracings. Tower strength improvement was investigated by adding a series of <b>diaphragm</b> bracing <b>types</b> at mid-height of the slender diagonal members. Analytical studies showed that considerable strength improvements could be achieved using diaphragm bracings.

With piezoelectric materials, {{it is possible to}} harvest power from vibrating structures. It has been proven that, micro to milliwatts of power can be generated from vibrating materials.

Thus, we developed a jack-down construction method that enables cost reduction and work period shortening by omitting temporary sheds and reducing recabling for those sheds (Fig. 1 (b)). Specifically, artificial ground is built at the height that does not inter-fere with existing sheds using sockets modularized with column-beam joints of an outer <b>diaphragm</b> <b>type</b> shown in Fig. 2. Then, the ground is jacked down to a specified height after removing existing sheds, and finally it is jointed with columns by filling in the gaps between columns and sockets with mortar or concrete. We assumed that socket joints are used only for cylindrical steel pipe columns; so, we created a formula to calculate ultimate strength applicable to such columns only.

METHOD: Between August 2002 and May 2004, 60 patients aged between 13 and 75 years old (39 males), having a pituitary adenoma were submitted to an endoscope transseptal approach. During the surgery and before tumor resection, 2 mm of the sellas floor were removed and a 1. 5 mm dural opening made to place a transducer into the pituitary adenoma. The transducer was connected to a pressure monitor. RESULTS: The intrasellar pressure, ranged from 2 - 51 mmHg and was measured based on the classification of Hardy-Vezina. The most elevated was in the type II macro adenomas with 32. 6 mmHg, sharply superior to the value of a normal intracranial pressure.
