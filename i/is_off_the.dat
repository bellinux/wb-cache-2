Plymouth Beach guards Plymouth Harbor and mostly {{consists}} of a three-mile (5km) long, ecologically significant barrier beach. Clark's Island, a small island in Plymouth Bay, is the only island in Plymouth. It <b>is</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> coast of Saquish Neck and has nine summer houses but no year-round inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium is {{the first}} in a {{downward}} trend in the melting and boiling points and atomization enthalpy in the 4d transition metals after the maximum seen at molybdenum, because the 4d subshell is more than half full and the electrons are contributing less to metallic bonding. (Technetium, the previous element, has an exceptionally low value that <b>is</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> trend due to its half-filled 4d55s2 configuration, though the small amount of energy needed to excite it to a 4d65s1 configuration indicates that it is not as far off the trend in the 4d series as manganese in the 3d transition series.) Unlike the lighter congener iron, ruthenium is paramagnetic at room temperature, as iron also is above its Curie point.|$|E
5|$|Ski touring {{takes place}} off-piste {{and outside of}} ski resorts. Tours may extend over {{multiple}} days. Typically, skis, bindings, and boots allow for free movement of the heel to enable a walking pace, as with Nordic disciplines and unlike Alpine skiing. Ski touring's subgenre ski mountaineering involves independently navigating and route finding through potential avalanche terrain and often requires familiarity with meteorology along with skiing skills. Ski touring can be faster and easier than summer hiking in some terrain, allowing for traverses and ascents that would be harder in the summer. Skis {{can also be used}} to access backcountry alpine climbing routes when snow <b>is</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> technical route, but still covers the hiking trail. In some countries, organizations maintain a network of huts for use by cross-country skiers in wintertime. For example, the Norwegian Trekking Association maintains over 400 huts stretching across thousands of kilometres of trails which hikers can use in the summer and skiers in the winter.|$|E

5|$|While {{the valve}} <b>is</b> <b>off,</b> <b>the</b> threads of {{cylinder}} and valve are checked {{to identify the}} thread type and condition. The threads of cylinder and valve must be of matching thread specification, clean and full form, undamaged and free of cracks, burrs and other imperfections. Ultrasonic inspection may be substituted for the pressure test, which is usually a hydrostatic test and may be either a proof test or a volumetric expansion test, depending on the cylinder design specification. Test pressure is specified in the stamp markings of the cylinder. Valves {{that are to be}} reused are inspected and maintained to ensure they remain fit for service. Before fitting the valve the thread type must be checked to ensure that a valve with matching thread specification is fitted.|$|E

25|$|On 25 January 1824 Columbine wrecked on Sapientza Island, which <b>is</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> {{southern}} {{coast of the}} Peloponnese, {{near the city of}} Meth√≥ni. She had sailed from Corfu on 15 January and had arrived at the island on 19 January. Abbott initially went on shore to conduct a survey of the harbour and anchored her off Port Longue. On the night of the 24th, the weather worsened and her single anchor did not hold her securely, with the result that she drove onto a reef and foundered. All her crew survived, having clambered onto the rocks. The subsequent court martial reprimanded Abbott and the master, James Atkinson, for having used only one anchor and for not having prepared for the eventuality of bad weather.|$|E
25|$|The {{story from}} Treason's Harbour has several points resolved, {{as to the}} success of Maturin's work {{identifying}} the French spies, the trap that Aubrey sailed out of but HMS Pollux did not, and Aubrey resolving the tension between him and Lieutenant Fielding, who escaped the worst French prisoner-of-war facility. In Gibraltar, Captain Aubrey receives another mission, to sail HMS Surprise to protect British whalers in the Pacific Ocean from USS Norfolk, for his first voyage around Cape Horn to protect British whalers. Dr Maturin has not yet identified the high-level spy who got away. Unaware, he sends the letter to his own wife explaining his protection of the Navy wife via that very villain. The Pacific Ocean is full of wonders, and prizes, once the Jonah <b>is</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> ship.|$|E
25|$|Each team {{must have}} eight {{players in the}} scrum, unless for some reason (i.e. a sending-off or injury) they cannot field 15 players. Specialised front-row players (i.e. props and hookers) {{must be part of}} the scrum for safety reasons under the law. If a {{specialised}} player is not available, the scrum must have 'no weight', which means no player is allowed to push forward once the scrum commences. In cases where a front-row player <b>is</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> field due to a yellow card (compulsory 10 minutes off the field) or a red card (no longer allowed to participate in the game), a temporary substitution of another player is mandatory to ensure specialist front-row players participate in the scrum. If a team cannot field eight in the scrum, generally it drops the flankers or the number eight, but the props, hooker and locks must be maintained.|$|E
