5000|$|This siphonous green alga is {{dark green}} in color. It {{appears as a}} <b>fuzzy</b> <b>patch</b> of tubular fingers.

However, <b>fuzzy</b> <b>patch</b> {{application}} is a relatively untrustworthy method, sometimes misapplying patches that have too little context (especially ones that create a new file), sometimes refusing to apply deletions that both derivatives have done.|$|E
50|$|Erigeron compactus {{is a small}} {{perennial}} herb rarely {{reaching a}} maximum height of 10 centimeters (4 inches). It grows in <b>fuzzy</b> <b>patches</b> and clumps of fleshy leaves, each no more than 2.5 centimeters (1 inche) long and somewhat rounded in cross-section. It erects short, hairy stems each holding a single flower head about a centimeter (0.4 inches) wide. The head has a yellow center of disc florets surrounded by white, pink, or bicolored (white with lilac stripe) ray florets.|$|R
25|$|The {{prominent}} {{open cluster}} the Pleiades {{has been recognized}} {{as a group of}} stars since antiquity, while the Hyades forms part of Taurus, one of the oldest constellations. Other open clusters were noted by early astronomers as unresolved <b>fuzzy</b> <b>patches</b> of light. The Roman astronomer Ptolemy mentions the Praesepe, the Double Cluster in Perseus, and the Ptolemy Cluster, while the Persian astronomer Al-Sufi wrote of the Omicron Velorum cluster. However, it would require the invention of the telescope to resolve these nebulae into their constituent stars. Indeed, in 1603 Johann Bayer gave three of these clusters designations as if they were single stars.|$|R

50|$|However, {{the patch}} program {{also has some}} {{facilities}} to apply the patch into a file that is not exactly similar as the origin file {{that was used to}} produce the patch. This process is called <b>fuzzy</b> <b>patch</b> application, and results in a kind of asymmetric three-way merge, where the changes in the patch are discarded if the patch program cannot find a place where to apply them.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the early}} days of {{telescopic}} astronomy, the word nebula was used to describe any <b>fuzzy</b> <b>patch</b> of light that did not look like a star. Many of these, such as the Andromeda Nebula, had spectra that looked like stellar spectra, and these turned out to be galaxies. Others, such as the Cat's Eye Nebula, had very different spectra. When William Huggins looked at the Cat's Eye, he found no continuous spectrum like that seen in the Sun, but just a few strong emission lines. The two green lines at 495.9 nm and 500.7 nm were the strongest. These lines did not correspond to any known elements on Earth. The fact that helium had been identified by the emission lines in the Sun in 1868, and had then also been found on Earth in 1895, encouraged astronomers to suggest that the lines were due to a new element. The name nebulium (occasionally nebulum or nephelium) was first mentioned by the wife of Huggins in a short communication in 1898, although it is stated that Huggins occasionally used the term before.|$|E

However, there were two flaws in Herschel's methodology: magnitude is not a reliable index to the distance of stars, and some of the areas that he mistook for empty space were actually dark, obscuring nebulae that blocked his view toward the center of the Milky Way.|$|R

How can an agent search new databases on our behalf? These are core questions for both human agents and intelligent software agents. We explore these questions with the joint tools of fuzzy rule-based systems and neural learning. These tools exploit the filter and set-theoretic structure of agent search. An intelligent agent {{can act as a}} smart database filter (Grosky, 1994; Maes, 1994). The agent can search a database or a space of objects on behalf of its user. The agent can find and retrieve objects that the user likes. Or the agent can find and then ignore or delete objects that the user does not like. Or it can perform some mix of both. The agent acts as a filter because it maps a set of o [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Additive fuzzy {{systems can}} filter {{impulsive}} noise from signals. Alpha-stable statistics model the impulsiveness as a parametrized family of probability density functions or unit-area bell curves. The bell-curve parameter ct ranges through the interval (0, 2] {{and gives the}} Gaussian bell curve when 0 t = 2 and gives the Cauchy bell curve when ~t = 1. The impulsiveness grows as ~ falls and the bell curves have thicker tails. Only the Gaussian statistics have finite variances or finite higher moments. An additive fuzzy system can learn ellipsoidal <b>fuzzy</b> rule <b>patches</b> from a new pseudo-covariation matrix or measure of alpha-stable covariation. Mahalanobis distance gives a joint set function for the learned if-part fuzzy sets of the if-then rules. The joint set function preserves input correlations that factored set functions ignore. Competitive learning tunes the local means and pseudo-covariations of the alpha-stable statistics and thus tunes the fuzzy rules. Then the covariation rules can both predict nonlinear signals in impulsive noise and filter the impulsive noise in time-series data. The fuzzy system filtered such noise better than did a benchmark radial basis neural network. 1. Filtering impulsive noise Impulsive noise is not Gaussian. The bell-curve density of impulsive noise has thicker tails than a Gaussian bell curve has. The thicker tails give rise to more frequent bursts of noise. The Cauchy density f(x) = 1 /n(l+x 2) has this property and so do all alpha-stable probability densities [17] for index parameter ~ in 0 < ~t < 2. The Cauchy density is the special case when ct = 1. The thicker polynomial tails give an infinite variance and give infinite higher-order moments. The lower-order fractional moments are still finite. The Gaussian density is the special case of an alpha-stable density when ct = 2. It is unique in this family because it has exponential tails and has finite variance and higher-order moments. Fig. 1 shows how alpha-stable noise grows more impulsive as the index ~t falls from 2 to 1...|$|R
