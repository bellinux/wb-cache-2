40|$|The spring/summer 2004 {{issue of}} the Journal of the National Collegiate Honors Council (JNCHC) was devoted {{exclusively}} to research <b>in</b> <b>honors</b> education. The issue was divided into three sections: the introductory Forum on Research <b>in</b> <b>Honors,</b> which revisited three essays published <b>in</b> Forum for <b>Honors</b> <b>in</b> 1984 and included two 2004 responses; Research in Honors; and Research about Honors. After I had revised my dissertation for the 2003 NCHC monograph Honors Composition: Historical Perspectives and Contemporary Practices, I incorporated some of my unused dissertation material for two pieces in the issue, one being a response essay in the Forum, “Research <b>in</b> <b>Honors</b> and Composition,” and the other {{an article in the}} Research <b>in</b> <b>Honors</b> section, “Faculty Compensation and Course Assessment <b>in</b> <b>Honors</b> Composition,” using material that my dissertation director thought was too political to survive the dissertation defense...|$|R

My career <b>in</b> <b>honors</b> began <b>in</b> 1985 when I was appointed the first director of UNL V 2 ̆ 7 s Honors Program and formally ended this past summer with my return to the Physics Department at UNL V. During the period between the Pittsburgh conference in 1995 and the San Francisco conference in 1996, I had the pleasure and honor of serving as NCHC President. In between those endpoints, 1985 and 2000, I have presented several workshops on the topic of science and mathematics education at honors conferences and had various musings about pedagogy published <b>in</b> <b>honors</b> journals (see References). What follows is a summary of successes and failures intermingled with suggestions on science and mathematics education <b>in</b> <b>honors</b> with an overlay of more general observations gleaned from fifteen years <b>in</b> <b>honors...</b>|$|R
