40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new hierarchical, two-level approach to <b>inventory</b> management and <b>control</b> in supply chains (SCs). A SC {{is viewed as}} a large-scale system that consists of production and inventory units, organised in a serial structure. It is supposed that the SC operates under uncertainty in customer demand, which is described by imprecise terms and modelled by fuzzy sets. Overall SC <b>inventories</b> <b>control</b> is achieved at two levels. First, a SC problem is decomposed into a number of subproblems related to its constituent parts, which form a followers level. Each follower is optimised independently according to its local objective. In order to improve overall SC performance, a leader level coordinates SC <b>inventories</b> <b>control</b> by modifying the optimisation subproblems at the followers level. This process is repeated iteratively until a satisfactory overall SC performance is achieved...|$|R

25|$|Regarding the {{traditional}} pull approach to <b>inventory</b> <b>control,</b> {{a number of}} techniques have been developed {{based on the work}} of Ford W. Harris (1913), which came to be known as the economic order quantity (EOQ) model. This model marks the beginning of inventory theory, which includes the Wagner-Within procedure, the newsvendor model, base stock model and the Fixed Time Period model. These models usually involve the calculation of cycle stocks and buffer stocks, the latter usually modeled as a function of demand variability. The economic production quantity (EPQ) differs from the EOQ model only in that it assumes a constant fill rate for the part being produced, instead of the instantaneous refilling of the EOQ model.|$|E
25|$|At {{the heart}} of yield {{management}} decision-making process is the trade-off of marginal yields from segments that are competing for the same inventory. In capacity-constrained cases, there is a bird-in-the-hand decision that forces the seller to reject lower revenue generating customers {{in the hopes that}} the inventory can be sold in a higher valued segment. The tradeoff is sometimes mistakenly identified as occurring at the intersection of the marginal revenue curves for the competing segments. While this is accurate when it supports marketing decisions where access to both segments is equivalent, it is wrong for <b>inventory</b> <b>control</b> decisions. In these cases the intersection of the marginal revenue curve of the higher valued segment with the actual value of the lower segment is the point of interest.|$|E

Charney was also responsible for American Apparel to be an early adopter of RFID tags on garments in 2007 in an effort to reduce theft and improve <b>inventory</b> <b>control.</b> In addition, Charney pioneered the Made in USA sweatshop-free model of transparency, fair wages and a refusal to outsource manufacturing.

25|$|Yield {{management}} {{spread to}} other travel and transportation companies in the early 1990s. Notable was implementation of yield management at National Car Rental. In 1993, General Motors was forced to take a $744 million charge against earnings related to its ownership of National Car Rental. In response, National's program expanded the definition of yield management to include capacity management, pricing and reservations control. As {{a result of this}} program, General Motors was able to sell National Car Rental for an estimated $1.2 billion. Yield management gave way to the more general practice of revenue management. Whereas revenue management involves predicting consumer behavior by segmenting markets, forecasting demand, and optimizing prices for several different types of products, yield management refers specifically to maximizing revenue through <b>inventory</b> <b>control.</b> Some notable revenue management implementations include the NBC which credits its system with $200 million in improved ad sales from 1996 to 2000, the target pricing initiative at UPS, and revenue management at Texas Children's Hospital. Since 2000, much of the dynamic pricing, promotions management and dynamic packaging that underlie ecommerce sites leverage revenue management techniques. In 2002 GMAC launched an early implementation of web based revenue management in the financial services industry.|$|E
