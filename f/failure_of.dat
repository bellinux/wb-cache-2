40|$|This paper {{presents}} fault-tolerant {{simulations of}} a single-writer multi-reader regular register in storage systems. One simulation tolerates fail-stop <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> storage servers and requires {{a majority of}} nonfaulty servers, while the other simulation tolerates Byzantine failures and assumes {{that two-thirds of the}} servers are nonfaulty. A construction of Afek et al. [3] is used to mask semi-Byzantine <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> clients that result in erroneous write operations. The simulations are used to derive Paxos algorithms that tolerate semi-Byzantine <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> clients as well as fail-stop or Byzantine <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> storage servers...|$|R

5|$|Following the <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the Cyberpunk album, Billy Idol did {{not produce}} another {{original}} album until 2005, 13 years later. However, this was not due to the <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the album, but rather his dissatisfaction with his producers at Chrysalis Records. With the founding of Sanctuary Records, an independent record label Idol felt positive about, {{and the formation of}} a new band with Steve Stevens, Idol decided to produce Devil's Playground. Idol's later album featured a more power pop and classic rock sound similar to Idol's 80s style, and received middling reviews.|$|E

The Abell Committee focused on six potential aerodynamic and mechanical causes: control flutter (which had led {{to the loss of}} DH 108 prototypes), structural failure due to high loads or metal fatigue of the wing structure, <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the powered flight controls, <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the window panels leading to explosive decompression, or fire and other engine problems. The committee concluded that fire was the most likely cause of the problem, and a number of changes were made to the aircraft to protect the engines and wings from damage that might lead to another fire.|$|E

This paper discusses the problem of environmental hazards related with <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> the injection installment {{on the surface and}} underground. The surface failures are most frequently related with sewage and waste pits, injection pumps, systems for physical and chemical processing of waste before injection, pumping pipelines, and wellhead in the injection well. The most common <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> the underground parts are: <b>failures</b> <b>of</b> pumping columns, sealing packer, casing and the cement layer in the angular space...|$|R

Other examples include swarms of mechanical insects (in The Invincible), and strangely ordered societies of more human-like beings in Fiasco and Eden, describing the <b>failure</b> <b>of</b> the first contact.
