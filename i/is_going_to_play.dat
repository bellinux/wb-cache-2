500|$|Roger Newcomb and Matt Richenthal, {{writing for}} {{websites}} We Love Soaps and TV Fanatic respectively, both described {{the decision to}} replace Russ with Nichols as surprising. Allison Waldman of AOL TV said the recast was [...] "bad news", as Russ was [...] "doing just fine as Tucker McCall, new billionaire in Genoa City". However, she also wrote that the role would be [...] "better suited" [...] for Nichols with Tucker becoming more of a [...] "romantic figure". Tara Blake of TVSource speculated that the character would be tied to a [...] "major Genoa City player" [...] {{and that was the}} reason for the recast. Gwen Morrett of About.com said that Nichols joining The Young and the Restless was [...] "truly their gain" [...] from Days of Our Lives (where the actor had previously portrayed Steve Johnson). Upon Nichols' debut, Megan Lynn of SoapNet wrote: [...] "Stephen certainly has soap experience — he's previously played Steve Johnson on Days of our Lives and Stefan Cassadine on General Hospital, but then again — we were kind of warming up to William." [...] Michael Fairman of On-Air On-Soaps wrote of the decision to hire Nichols onto the series: [...] "This week, daytime fans get one of their wishes, to see Stephen Nichols back on daytime. From his role as Stefan on GH to Patch on DAYS, you know that Stephen Nichols <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> Tucker for all he is worth, and then some." [...] In August 2010, Tommy Garrett of Canyon News wrote of Nichols' portrayal, saying: [...] "Now going into the 21st century, Stephen has reinvented another part of himself and inhabits Genoa City as the town’s newest and most handsome billionaire on CBS’s number-one daytime drama The Young and the Restless." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{high-profile}} acquisition paid immediate financial dividends for Galaxy {{long before}} Beckham joined the team. On {{the strength of}} the signing and the media frenzy it created, the club was able to pull off a new five-year shirt sponsorship deal with Herbalife nutrition company worth US$20million. The gate revenue peaked as well with 11,000 new season tickets holders and sold-out luxury suites (each one of the 42 inside the team's home ground, the Home Depot Center).

Involved on many business fronts worldwide, AEG was already leveraging its Beckham association in places such as China, where the company had been working aggressively in Shanghai and Beijing for years to receive clearance to build arenas and stadiums.

Despite this, Nigel Clough voiced his concerns over Commons' early season form, saying after a 1–1 draw with Barnsley; [...] "For the amount of good possession we got to Kris Commons on Saturday, we didn’t get anything from it and I said that to him after the game. We got the ball to him in decent areas, running at the back four, 10 yards outside the box, and we didn’t get a cross, shot or save from the goalkeeper. If he <b>is</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>play</b> in there he must start producing something." [...] Commons responded with seven goals in his next nine games, including braces in a 3–1 win over Middlesbrough (in which he also missed a penalty), a 3–2 win at Doncaster Rovers and a 2–0 win at Ipswich Town to take his goal tally to nine from 15 league starts.|$|E
