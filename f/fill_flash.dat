50|$|<b>Fill</b> <b>flash</b> is a {{photographic}} technique used to brighten deep shadow areas, typically outdoors on sunny days, though {{the technique is}} useful any time the background is significantly brighter than {{the subject of the}} photograph, particularly in backlit subjects. To use <b>fill</b> <b>flash,</b> the aperture and shutter speed are adjusted to correctly expose the background, and the flash is fired to lighten the foreground.|$|E
50|$|Most {{point and}} shoot cameras include a <b>fill</b> <b>flash</b> mode that forces the flash to fire, even in bright light.|$|E
5000|$|... 24 December 1953 - Tangiwai {{disaster}} - Tangiwai, North Island, New Zealand: the Tangiwai {{railway bridge}} over the Whangaehu River collapsed as the overnight express train between Wellington and Auckland passed over it; the bridge supports had been weakened by a lahar (a volcanic ash and debris <b>filled</b> <b>flash</b> flood) {{a few minutes before}} the train passed. 151 people were killed. A passerby is not able to warn the train in time. The rebuilt bridge is equipped with high water warning devices.|$|R

50|$|Flash {{bracketing}} is {{a technique}} of working with electronic flash, especially when used as <b>fill</b> <b>flash</b> in combination with existing light, maintaining the overall amount of exposure. The amount of light provided by the flash is varied in a bracketed series {{in order to find}} the most pleasing combination of ambient light and <b>fill</b> <b>flash.</b> If used for this purpose, flash bracketing can be differentiated from normal exposure bracketing via flash, although the usage of the term is not strict.|$|E

The story is broken by time of present and past, just like a person in diaspora are torn between their present home and past home.|$|R
50|$|Program mode can {{be biased}} towards longer or shorter shutter speeds {{by using the}} shutter speed dial. Also in program mode {{automatic}} flash exposure was fully controlled by the camera: off in daylight conditions, <b>fill</b> in <b>flash</b> with low light, full flash when dark. Normal flash synchronisation speed is 1/250s and with suitable flash units can {{be up to the}} camera's highest speed of 1/8000s.|$|R
40|$|The {{lethality}} of pulsed ultra-violet (UV) rich {{light for}} the inactivation of pathogenic bacteria has been investigated. A low pressure xenon <b>filled</b> <b>flash</b> lamps that produced UV intensities have been used. The pulsed {{operation of the}} system enable the release of electrical energy {{stored in the capacitor}} into the flash lamp within a short time and produces the high current and high peak power required for emitting the intense UV flash. The flash frequency was adjusted to one pulse per second. Several types of bacteria were investigated for their susceptibility to pulsed UV illumination. The treated bacterial populations were reduced and determined by direct viable counts. Among the tested bacteria Pseudomonas aeruginosa was the most susceptible to the pulsed UV- light with a 8 log 10 cfu/ml reduction after 11 pulses, while the spores of Bacillus megaterium was the most resistant and only 4 log 10 cfu/ml reduction achieved after 50 pulses of illumination. The results of this study demonstrated that pulsed UV- light technology could be used as an effective method for the inactivation, of pathogenic bacteria in different environments such as drinking water...|$|R

5000|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Beibs in the Trap", {{directed}} by RJ Sanchez, premiered on December 28, 2016, via Scott's Vevo channel. It features Scott and Nav performing the song at a hangar <b>filled</b> with <b>flashing</b> lights and models. A metallic silver Lamborghini is showcased {{throughout the entire}} video. Peter A. Berry from XXL wrote; [...] "The lights and the models' wardrobes make this visual seem like something ripped directly from the upcoming Ghost in the Shell movie, and it looks {{more than a little}} cool." [...] Eric Skelton of Pigeons & Planes wrote that all that is missing is [...] "Justin Bieber sitting in the corner wearing metallic Hammer pants".|$|R
60|$|I {{thought that}} I {{was sitting on}} the ground on the outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground. He was all over as bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him; his countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, {{impossible}} for words to describe; when he stepped upon the ground with his feet I thought the earth trembled, just as it had done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked to my apprehension {{as if it had been}} <b>filled</b> with <b>flashes</b> of fire.|$|R
50|$|Galen Rowell also {{mastered}} {{the technique of}} using balanced <b>fill</b> <b>flash</b> which allowed him to lighten the deepest shadows in a subtle way to match the relatively narrow dynamic range of color reversal film.|$|E
50|$|When a flash {{device is}} used for filling in shadows (<b>fill</b> <b>flash)</b> in sunlit scenes, {{it is capable of}} doing so only at {{distances}} that are a function of its guide number. The maximum guide number of the flash device establishes the maximum possible distance at which it can be used.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Using backlighting, this {{portrait}} is improved by not allowing the harsh sunlight to cast hot {{spots on the}} faces AND by ringing the couple with an outlining effect, thus separating them from the background. A <b>fill</b> <b>flash</b> on the camera adds the required uniform illumination to the areas shaded from the sun.|$|E
40|$|The {{design of}} 6 ½” arc length, xenon <b>filled</b> <b>flash</b> tubes capable of {{withstanding}} energy inputs up to 10000 joules is described. The lamp performance is investigated {{as a function}} of filling pressure, bore size of lamp between 10 mm and 15 mm, operating voltage, energy input and circuit parameters. The lamp life has been related to input energy, flash duration and the inner wall area of the lamp. Above a given lamp wall loading, the lamp is likely to shatter in the first few discharges. Lamp efficiency, measurements show that for a fixed capacitor bank, operating voltage variation between 1. 0 and 2. 4 kV does not change the efficiency and that the efficiency is lower when a lamp is lightly loaded. Flash duration is almost independent of bank voltage and tube bore. The peak light intensity is increased and the flash duration decreased by a factor 2 when the lamp series inductance is changed from 450 μH to 100 μH. Design aspects of a laser system using ruby rods 6 ½” long x ½" diameter are studied and the output characteristics of six ruby rods of varying optical quality measured. The laser performance does not necessarily depend on the rod optical quality. Measurements of the variation of laser performance with lamp operating parameters show a linear relationship between output energy and input energy above laser threshold. For maximum efficiency, the lamp should be operated with a low bank capacity, a high bank voltage and short flash duration provided the lamp wall loading limit is not exceeded. The 10 mm bore lamp gives the highest efficiency. Measurement of the output beam divergence shows that the ruby rods giving the lowest beam divergence are of the best optical quality...|$|R
30|$|On {{enhanced}} MRI, {{there is}} a typical peripheral nodular enhancement with centripetal progression, resulting in diffuse high signal intensity on delayed phase images. Less commonly, <b>flash</b> <b>filling</b> of an entire small haemangioma or enhancement of small portions of the lesion, on arterial phase images, may be seen. Larger lesions may not demonstrate uniform enhancement on delayed phase images, probably due to areas of thrombosis or insufficient delay time. Central scars {{may be seen in}} hepatic haemangiomas.|$|R
50|$|The {{color-coded}} eggs {{themselves are}} another gameplay element. As Billy runs over fruit while holding an egg, the egg gains maturity and gets larger. When the egg's maturity gauge completely <b>fills,</b> the egg <b>flashes</b> and {{is ready to}} hatch. Then Billy can hatch the eggs, which can contain helper animals, character powerups, and extra lives. With variables such as egg size, helper animals, and personal powerups, Billy Hatcher can be played in many ways. Different animals {{can come out of}} the same eggs, and some creatures are vital to progressing through certain challenges.|$|R
50|$|An {{integral}} flash was fitted; this retracted {{into the}} top of the camera on the left (from the user's perspective) and was manually extended via releasing a catch on the camera's front. The unit had a guide number of 14 (at ISO 100 in meters) and featured auto-exposure with the camera's light meter as well as supporting <b>fill</b> <b>flash.</b> Also on the front was a self-timer control.|$|E
50|$|In {{the middle}} of the day, the bright {{overhead}} sun can create strong highlights and dark shadows. The degree to which overexposure can occur varies because different types of film and digital cameras have different dynamic ranges.This harsh lighting problem is particularly important in portrait photography, where a <b>fill</b> <b>flash</b> is often necessary to balance lighting across the subject's face or body, filling in strong shadows that are usually considered undesirable.|$|E
50|$|If not wanted, the {{metering}} can {{be changed}} with exposure compensation, two-point (average) metering, metering on the bright lights or use of center-weighted or spot metering, <b>fill</b> <b>flash</b> or RAW images. Increasing the dynamic range by use of Active D-Lighting or reducing the contrast settings (the default contrast is higher compared to previous Nikon DSLRs) aids when shooting JPEGs. After taking the image, contrast and brightness can easily be changed in camera.|$|E
5000|$|There {{were several}} models of photoflash bombs, but most {{had a similar}} {{construction}} and makeup. For example, the M23A1 was constructed of a cardboard tube, capped on both ends with metal [...] "plugs." [...] The tube was then <b>filled</b> with a <b>flash</b> powder [...] "charge" [...] and a fuse. The fuse would {{be attached to the}} hanging wire using a standard friction wire, which would ignite the flash powder after a specified delay. In this specific model of ordnance, the flash would last approximately 1/5th of a second after detonation.|$|R
60|$|Sir John Dory made a sign. In {{another moment}} Bernadine {{would have been}} arrested. It seemed, indeed, as though nothing could save him now from this {{crowning}} humiliation. He himself, white and furious, {{was at a loss}} how to deal with an unexpected situation. Suddenly a thing happened stranger than any one of them there had ever dreamed of, so strange that even men such as Peter, Sogrange and Dory, whose nerves were of iron, faced one another, doubting and amazed. The floor beneath them rocked and billowed like the waves of a canvas sea. The windows were <b>filled</b> with <b>flashes</b> of red light, a great fissure parted the wall, the pictures and book-cases came crashing down beneath a shower of masonry. It was the affair of a second. Above them shone the stars and around them a noise like thunder. Bernadine, who alone understood, was the first to recover himself. He stood in the midst of them, his hands above his head, laughing as he looked around at the strange storm, laughing like a madman.|$|R
5|$|The {{video is}} set at night and opens with Brown, {{dressed in a black}} suit, {{drinking}} alcohol in the streets, before hailing a futuristic hover-cab. Brown asks the cab driver {{to take him to the}} best spot in town. He then asks the driver to turn up the air conditioner because he's hot, but the driver turns up the music instead, while wearing a horse mask on his head. As the song begins, Brown exits the cab and arrives at a street party filled with people wearing animal heads. He then enters a club, where he performs the first dance sequence in the video with his male backup dancers. During the first chorus, Brown arrives inside the main room of the club <b>filled</b> with <b>flashing</b> lights and people dancing while wearing animal heads. After a hat gets tossed to him by one of his dancers in the crowd, Brown and his backup dancers perform another dance sequence as the queen of the party watches them from her perch. These party scenes are intercut with scenes of Brown dancing alone in another room surrounded by flashing lights and speakers in the background.|$|R
5000|$|Underwater photographers {{solve this}} problem by {{combining}} two techniques. The first {{is to get the}} camera as close to the photographic subject as possible, minimizing the horizontal loss of color. Many serious underwater photographers consider any more than about one yard or meter unacceptable. The second technique is the use of a flash to restore colour lost to depth. <b>Fill</b> <b>flash,</b> used effectively, [...] "paints" [...] in missing colors by providing full-spectrum visible light to the overall exposure.|$|E
5000|$|The {{advantage}} {{of using a}} <b>fill</b> <b>flash</b> located near the lens axis is [...] "normalizing" [...] exposure in situations like backlighting which exceed {{the ability of the}} camera to handle the contrast of the lighting. The disadvantage is the same one seen in indoor near-axis flash shots; a lack of directional modeling clues. Near-axis flash indoors and outdoors looks unnatural because natural light comes from overhead putting specular highlights higher on round surfaces like cheeks and creates downward and sideways shadow clues which, combined, help the brain interpret the 3D shape of objects in 2D photographs.|$|E
50|$|Faces {{oriented}} {{towards the}} sun at midday will usually have dark shadows in the eye sockets due to the steep downward angle {{of the sun and}} the preference of the subjects not to be blinded by the sun. When near-axis <b>fill</b> <b>flash</b> is added in that situation it hits the shaded eyes and sunlit face equally so the eyes will always remain darker than the face. What happens on a cause and effect level is the flash acts like fill and more key light where it overlaps. The eyes will seem brighter due to the addition of catchlight reflections from the flash but they will still look dull and lifeless.|$|E
40|$|This study uses a {{computer-aided}} simulation {{approach to}} predict the multipreform shapes of warm-forming intricate components. Nearly 100 % of the scraps of primary hollow preforms are used to make secondary hollow preforms. This study simultaneously fabricates the AISI 316 L stainless steel watch bezel by using scraps from the corresponding watch case. The appropriate preforms are designed {{with the aid of}} computer simulation such that die <b>filling</b> is completed, <b>flash</b> is reduced, and forming load is decreased. The specimens were prepared by custom-made tooling to verify the simulation results. Furthermore, the forming facilities are specially configured to carry out the physical experiments. Engineers eventually {{gain a better understanding of}} the warm-forming process using computer simulation. Moreover, they are able to design accurate preforms and fully utilize the material, which leads to a 50 % improvement of the material utilization rate. The full material utilization also saves 40 % and 20 % of the total production cost and time, respectively. Department of Industrial and Systems Engineerin...|$|R
5000|$|In the nonfiction book by John Gilmore, L.A.

Nash's clubs attracted diverse groups, as he operated clubs marketed towards gays, straights, blacks, whites and others.|$|R
60|$|June 27.—The ague {{again so}} violent that I lay a-bed all day, and neither ate nor drank. I {{was ready to}} perish for thirst; but so weak, I had not {{strength}} to stand up, or to get myself any water to drink. Prayed to God again, but was light-headed; and when I was not, I was so ignorant that I knew not what to say; only I lay and cried, “Lord, look upon me! Lord, pity me! Lord, have mercy upon me!” I suppose I did nothing else {{for two or three}} hours; till, the fit wearing off, I fell asleep, and did not wake till far in the night. When I awoke, I found myself much refreshed, but weak, and exceeding thirsty. However, as I had no water in my habitation, I was forced to lie till morning, and went to sleep again. In this second sleep I had this terrible dream: I thought that I was sitting on the ground, on the outside of my wall, where I sat when the storm blew after the earthquake, and that I saw a man descend from a great black cloud, in a bright flame of fire, and light upon the ground. He was all over as bright as a flame, so that I could but just bear to look towards him; his countenance was most inexpressibly dreadful, impossible for words to describe. When he stepped upon the ground with his feet, I thought the earth trembled, just as it had done before in the earthquake, and all the air looked, to my apprehension, {{as if it had been}} <b>filled</b> with <b>flashes</b> of fire. He was no sooner landed upon the earth, but he moved forward towards me, with a long spear or weapon in his hand, to kill me; and when he came to a rising ground, at some distance, he spoke to me—or I heard a voice so terrible that it is impossible to express the terror of it. All that I can say I understood was this: “Seeing all these things have not brought thee to repentance, now thou shalt die;” at which words, I thought he lifted up the spear that was in his hand to kill me.|$|R
