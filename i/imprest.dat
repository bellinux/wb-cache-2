In 1782, the Board of Works, reporting on [...] "the dangerous state of the old part of the House", stated that [...] "no time be lost in taking down said building". In 1783, the Duke of Portland moved out because it was once again in need of repair. A committee found that the money spent so far was insufficient. This time the Board of Works declared that [...] "the Repairs, Alterations & Additions at the Chancellor of the Exchequer's House will amount to the sum of £5,580, exclusive of the sum for which they already have His Majesty's Warrant. And praying a Warrant for the said sum of £5,580—and also praying an <b>Imprest</b> of that sum {{to enable them to}} pay the Workmen". This proved to be a gross underestimate; the final bill was over £11,000. The Morning Herald fumed about the expense: [...] "£500pounds p.a. preceding the Great Repair, and £11,000 the Great Repair itself! So much has this extraordinary edifice cost the country – For one moiety [...] of the sum a much better dwelling might have been purchased!"

A check account from both offices, of drafts and receipts, should be annually made up in the Exchequer,--charging the Bank in account with the cash balance, but not demanding the payment until there is an order from the Treasury, in consequence of a vote of Parliament.|$|R

50|$|In 1622 {{he had a}} {{grant in}} {{reversion}} of the auditorship of <b>imprests</b> and of the auditorship of the Mint. Freeman hoped that through Lord Buckingham, he would succeed Thomas Murray as provost of Eton, but the appointment was given to Sir Henry Wotton. Freeman then unsuccessfully applied to Buckingham {{to be allowed to}} succeed Wotton as ambassador at Venice.|$|R
50|$|In 1735 he {{took over}} the remunerative post of Auditor of the <b>Imprests</b> which he had been promised in 1717, a {{position}} he held until his death in 1754.

60|$|My idea, therefore, is, {{to reduce}} those offices to fixed salaries, {{as the present}} lives and reversions shall {{successively}} fall. I mean, that {{the office of the}} great auditor (the auditor of the receipt) shall be reduced to 3000l. a year; and the auditors of the <b>imprest,</b> {{and the rest of the}} principal officers, to fixed appointments of 1,500l. a year each. It will not be difficult to calculate the value of this fall of lives to the public, when we shall have obtained a just account of the present income of those places; and we shall obtain that account with great facility, if the present possessors are not alarmed with any apprehension of danger to their freehold office.|$|E

50|$|In February 1754, his {{father-in-law}} procured {{for him the}} lucrative sinecure of auditor of the <b>imprests,</b> in succession to William Benson. The by-election that followed his appointment was not contested. In the 1754 general election that spring, Newcastle had him returned for Boroughbridge again; Watson also led the poll in Kent, where he and Robert Fairfax stood as Whigs and defeated Sir Edward Dering, one of the sitting Tory members. Watson chose to sit for Kent. However, he aspired to the House of Lords, as he enjoyed the estates of the extinct earldom of Rockingham and could well afford to support a title. Nor did he wish to stand for the county again. Newcastle pressed his claims strongly on the King, and was ultimately successful: Watson was created Baron Sondes, of Lees Court in the Peerage of Great Britain on 22 May 1760 and vacated his seat in the Commons. In 1785, the office of auditor of the <b>imprests</b> was abolished, and he received an annuity of £7,000 a year for life in compensation.|$|R
