5|$|Wings <b>for</b> <b>My</b> Flight: The Peregrine Falcons of Chimney Rock is a 1991 book by American {{wildlife}} biologist Marcy Cottrell Houle. Wings <b>for</b> <b>My</b> Flight documents Houle's observations {{of a pair}} of the then-endangered peregrine falcons at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in Colorado, while employed by the Colorado Division of Wildlife in the summer of 1975. To protect the falcons, Houle had to halt a million-dollar project to turn ancient Anasazi ruins in the area into a tourist attraction and faced opposition and harassment by the Chimney Rock community as a result. The community eventually showed concern for Houle, however, after her trailer was broken into and vandalized.|$|E
5|$|Bullet <b>for</b> <b>My</b> Valentine, often {{abbreviated}} as BFMV or B4MV, are a Welsh {{heavy metal}} band from Bridgend, formed in 1998. The band {{is composed of}} Matthew Tuck (lead vocals, rhythm guitar), Michael Paget (lead guitar, backing vocals), Michael Thomas (drums) and Jamie Mathias (bass guitar). Former members include Nick Crandle and Jason James; both were on bass. They were formed under the name Jeff Killed John and started their music career by covering songs by Metallica and Nirvana. Jeff Killed John recorded six songs which were not released; two of these tracks were reworked later in their career as Bullet <b>for</b> <b>My</b> Valentine. Financial difficulties dictated the name change, which {{was followed by a}} change in music direction. In 2002, the band secured a five-album deal with Sony BMG. The band has stated that their music is influenced by classic metal acts such as Metallica, Iron Maiden and Slayer. The band is part of the Cardiff music scene.|$|E

5|$|Marcy Cottrell Houle wrote Wings <b>for</b> <b>My</b> Flight in {{the several}} decades {{following}} a major {{decline in the}} peregrine falcon population, which occurred between 1950 and 1970. During the 1930s and 1940s, an estimated 1000 breeding pairs of peregrine falcons inhabited the western United States and Mexico, coupled with 500 pairs in the eastern U.S. By the 1970s, no peregrine falcons were discovered east of the Rocky Mountains, and in the west, peregrine falcon populations had declined by 80 to 90 percent. By 1975, {{the year in which}} the events of Wings <b>for</b> <b>My</b> Flight take place, only 324 pairs of peregrine falcons were known to reside in North America, with only seven pairs in the Rocky Mountains region, and one at Chimney Rock, a prominent rock formation in southwestern Colorado.|$|E
