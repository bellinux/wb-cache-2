In June 2015, the Washington State Department of Transportation removed part of the refuge island at the intersection of State Route 99 and Airport Road to create a through lane exclusively for Swift buses.|$|E
5|$|The pair of {{interchanges}} connecting NY390 to I-490 and NY31 {{have two}} major movements that cause weaving. The first is on NY390 northbound, where traffic entering NY390 from I-490 west must immediately merge <b>into</b> <b>traffic</b> to avoid taking the NY31 exit while motorists already on NY390 must cross traffic coming from I-490 {{to reach the}} ramp for NY31. The other is on NY390 southbound, where commuters entering NY390 south from NY31 must cross several lanes of traffic to access I-490 east. Additionally, the junction between NY390/ I-390 and I-490 serves over 200,000 cars daily and is often heavily congested during the morning and evening rush hours. In July 2010, the New York State Department of Transportation began soliciting {{ideas on how to}} improve the junction. Roughly $32million has been earmarked for a future project to improve the interchange, which is tentatively scheduled to begin in mid-2014.|$|E

5|$|The system's {{predecessors}} {{date back}} to the opening of the Trunk Line in 1854. By 1902, all the routes used by the present commuter rail had been taken into service. Electrification started in 1922, and Class 62 EMUs were introduced in 1931, followed by Class 65 units in 1936 and Class 67 in 1953. Electrification was completed in 1963. In 1980, the Drammen Line was connected {{to the rest of the}} system and all trains started operating to the new OsloS. The high-speed Gardermoen Line opened in 1998. In 2013, new Stadler FLIRT units were taken <b>into</b> <b>traffic,</b> and the Asker Line was completed just before. By 2018, the Follo Line is scheduled to open.|$|E
5|$|By lap 20, Max Verstappen, impeded by his tyre {{failure at}} the start, had moved up into twelfth {{while at the}} front, Hamilton {{extended}} his advantage over Bottas to 7.5 seconds on lap 24 with Vettel also moving closer to the Finn. After several drivers had opted to pit during the second safety car phase, most drivers at the front decided {{to come in for}} their regular pit stops starting on lap 25. Carlos Sainz crossed the white line when exiting pit lane, receiving a five-second penalty to be served at his second stop. Bottas {{was the first of the}} front runners to pit on lap 27, emerging <b>into</b> <b>traffic.</b> This allowed Sebastian Vettel to make up time by staying out longer, eventually emerging from his pit stop ahead of Bottas on lap 31. One lap later, Räikkönen made a pit stop as well, coming out just behind Bottas. Race leader Hamilton came in another lap later, retaining his lead without incident. On lap 37, Räikkönen used the Drag Reduction System (DRS) to move ahead of Bottas for fifth place, only for the Williams driver to retake the position in the next corner.|$|E

25|$|In 2004, {{the parents}} of a 6-year-old boy in Miami sued the police {{department}} for firing a Taser at their child. The police said the boy was threatening to injure his own leg with a shard of glass, and said that using the device was the safest option to prevent the boy from injuring himself. Nevertheless, the boy's mother told CNN that the three officers involved probably found it easier to reason with her child. Also in 2004, a 12-year-old girl skipping school and drinking alcohol was Tasered in Miami-Dade while she was running from police and started to run <b>into</b> <b>traffic.</b> The Taser was successfully deployed to stop her from being hit by cars or causing an automobile accident.

However, she discovers there is a link between the incident and her knowledge over Nick's affair. Murray arrests Savage, but in doing so learns that Rachel has used the PNC on Savage's vehicle months ago, an abuse of her powers. Murray informs her that her career is over, but Janet intervenes, informing Gill that she was with Rachel at the time and did not report the incident and as such, leaves her with the ultimatum that both of them should be fired, straining Gill and Janet's strong friendship. Gill, under much pressure, agrees to allow the misdemeanor to slip by unnoticed on the condition that neither of them ever fails her again.|$|E

500|$|McGrady {{was known}} for his laid-back {{demeanor}} and scoring prowess; he once scored 41 points in a game despite being asleep right until tip-off, a performance that inspired the nickname [...] "The Big Sleep". Many of his contemporaries, including Kobe Bryant and Paul Pierce, have called him {{one of the most difficult}} players that they ever had to guard. His playing style has been compared to that of George Gervin; both players made scoring appear easy with their [...] "smooth" [...] approach to the game. At his peak, McGrady was an explosive player capable of finishing at the rim over the defense; in a piece for ESPN, Zach Lowe elaborated, [...] "He glided through the lane, crouched <b>into</b> <b>traffic,</b> and accelerated suddenly -- almost violently -- through a forest of slower-moving forms, and to the rim." [...] McGrady would frequently pull up for deep three-pointers over unsuspecting defenders, making him a threat to score from anywhere on the court. These qualities, in addition to his ability to survey the floor and make accurate pocket passes when necessary, have led analysts to describe him as being ahead of his time; in 2017, ESPN's Amin Elhassan remarked that McGrady was built for the style of positionless basketball that was being played in the modern era. On the defensive side of the ball, McGrady's effort was less consistent, but he demonstrated the ability to raise his level in meaningful games, such as during the playoffs against the Mavericks, where he often drew the assignment of guarding Dirk Nowitzki.|$|E
500|$|Ward {{noted that}} EA's snowboarding video game series SSX was an {{influence}} for Burnout 3s bolder and brasher nature. There was {{an emphasis on}} making the game more aggressive than previous instalments. Ward described Burnout 3 as a game about [...] "fighting through traffic" [...] rather than [...] "racing through traffic". This approach to the game's design led {{to the introduction of}} Takedowns, a feature that rewarded the player with boost and points for knocking their opponents off the track. The Takedown mechanic became a focal point of Burnout 3s design and led to other innovations. At first, the team were not convinced by the idea of having the game's camera pan to show the crash of a taken out vehicle while the player was driving; however, once it was implemented, they agreed that the feature worked well. From there, they decided to show a player's crash as well, which gave rise to the aftertouch mechanic. The crash mode from Burnout 2 was expanded and redesigned to be more puzzle-based; aftertouch control, crashbreakers, and multiplayer support were added to the mode. They wanted to include ramps in crash events so that vehicles could fly <b>into</b> <b>traffic,</b> however the game's physics system was designed to push cars down on the track to prevent them from taking off during a race. This caused vehicles to descend immediately after driving off a ramp. To bypass this issue they [...] "killed" [...] the vehicle once it hit the ramp, leaving it a wreck that was unaffected by the driving physics.|$|E
