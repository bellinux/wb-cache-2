5|$|Following the war, the 1950s and 1960s {{saw many}} large scale {{developments}} in the city. The Sheffield Tramway was closed, and {{a new system of}} roads, including the <b>Inner</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>Road,</b> were laid out. Also at this time many of the old slums were cleared and replaced with housing schemes such as the Park Hill flats, and the Gleadless Valley estate.|$|E

5|$|The <b>Inner</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>Road</b> was {{constructed}} {{over the course}} of the 1960s. This was the most ambitious scheme of its kind in the UK with Leeds City Council subsequently promoting the city with the slogan Motorway City of the Seventies. The works involved the construction of many flyovers and tunnels and the Motorway construction is notable in itself.|$|E

5|$|In 2015, Transport for London {{announced}} {{its intention to}} close one lane in each direction on Euston Road between 2020 and 2026 to accommodate work on High Speed 2. The decision was condemned by Camden Borough Council as it could affect business and cost more than £1 billion in lost revenue. The Automobile Association said the works were the largest ever proposed in London and would affect far more than local traffic due to its <b>Inner</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>Road</b> status.|$|E
5000|$|... 'Between the wall' was {{a common}} term for the city area between Prästgatan, Bollhusgränd and Baggensgränd. These streets were Stockholm's <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> <b>roads</b> that enveloped the {{heart-shaped}} of the Stadsholmens. Much of today's Prästgatan and Baggensgränd served as look-out points {{to the end of}} the north part of Tre Kronor castle. The southern tip of the city wall, including its southern port, was wiped out in the 14th century when the Black Friars' Monastery was built at this location.|$|R

5|$|The A57 and A61 {{roads are}} the major trunk roads through Sheffield. These run east–west and north–south respectively, {{crossing}} in the city centre, from where the other major roads generally radiate spoke-like. An <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> <b>road,</b> mostly constructed in the 1970s and extended in 2007 to form a complete ring, allows traffic to avoid the city centre, and an outer ring road runs to the east, south east and north, nearer {{the edge of the}} city, but does not serve the western side of Sheffield.|$|E

The streets in the green set have a background in retail and commercial properties.|$|E
5|$|Dolmabahçe Palace, {{the seat}} of {{government}} during the late Ottoman period, {{is located in the}} Beşiktaş district on the European shore of the Bosphorus strait, to the north of Beyoğlu. The Sublime Porte (Bâb-ı Âli), which became a metonym for the Ottoman government, was originally used to describe the Imperial Gate (Bâb-ı Hümâyûn) at the outermost courtyard of the Topkapı Palace; but after the 18th century, the Sublime Porte (or simply Porte) began to refer to the gate of the Sadrazamlık (Prime Ministry) compound in the Cağaloğlu quarter near Topkapı Palace, where the offices of the Sadrazam (Grand Vizier) and other Viziers were located, and where foreign diplomats were received. The former village of Ortaköy is situated within Beşiktaş and gives its name to the Ortaköy Mosque on the Bosphorus, near the Bosphorus Bridge. Lining both the European and Asian shores of the Bosphorus are the historic yalıs, luxurious chalet mansions built by Ottoman aristocrats and elites as summer homes. Farther inland, outside the city's <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> <b>road,</b> are Levent and Maslak, Istanbul's main business districts.|$|E

50|$|The Intermediate Ring Road or IMRR are roads {{identified}} as the main connecting roads between various Radial Roads in Hyderabad, Telangana, India.

5000|$|Several {{important}} motorways {{pass through}} the borough, notably the A 96 (Munich-Lindau) and A 95 (Munich-Garmisch) Autobahnen which connect to the [...] "Mittlerer Ring", Munich's <b>inner</b> city <b>ring</b> <b>road</b> system. This has brought about concerns over the volume of traffic and environmental issues. The borough's face was altered by extensive construction and landscaping work for the 1983 IGA display Westpark, complete with provisions for open air cinema, theatre and concerts, culinary delights, a Buddhist temple, play areas and other amenities.|$|R
5|$|The {{internal}} roads linking {{different parts}} of the city are mostly federal roads constructed and maintained by Malaysian Public Works Department. There are five major highways linking the Johor Bahru Central Business District to outlying suburbs: Tebrau Highway and Johor Bahru Eastern Dispersal Link Expressway in the northeast, Skudai Highway in the northwest, Iskandar Coastal Highway in the west and Johor Bahru East Coast Highway in the east. Pasir Gudang Highway and the connecting Johor Bahru Parkway cross Tebrau Highway and Skudai Highway, which serve as the middle ring road of the metropolitan area. The Johor Bahru <b>Inner</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>Road,</b> which connects with the Sultan Iskandar customs complex, aids in controlling the traffic in and around the central business district. Access to the national expressway is provided through the North–South Expressway and Senai–Desaru Expressway. The Johor–Singapore Causeway links the city to Woodlands, Singapore with a six-lane road and a railway line terminating at the Southern Integrated Gateway. Further expansion of other major highways in the city were currently in the process to improve the city road connection.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to Johor Bahru <b>Inner</b> <b>Ring</b> <b>Road</b> (JBIRR) as the <b>inner</b> <b>ring</b> <b>road</b> in Johor Bahru, Pasir Gudang Highway, Second Link Expressway and Johor Bahru Parkway also act as middle ring roads of the city. Second Link Expressway and the Senai–Desaru Expressway may form the outer ring roads of Johor Bahru.|$|E

50|$|Cary Parkway (SR 3977) {{is a major}} {{semi-circular}} {{route through}} Cary, North Carolina. The parkway serves approximately as Cary's outer ring highway, though it does not form a complete circle like the <b>inner</b> <b>ring,</b> Maynard <b>Road.</b> Viewing {{a map of the}} city as a clock-face, Cary Parkway extends counterclockwise approximately from the 1 o'clock position in the northeast down to the 5 o'clock position in the southeast. At that point, the road departs from its circular path and heads southeast toward its terminus at Holly Springs Road.|$|R
50|$|Trinity Walk is 500,000 sq ft {{partially}} enclosed shopping centre with over 55 stores and 1000 car parking spaces, with access from Wakefield’s <b>inner</b> city <b>ring</b> <b>road</b> (A61) {{and the main}} bus station. The centre contains major stores, including an 8,500 m² Sainsbury's and a 9,000 m² Debenhams, and retailers Next, New Look, Top Man Topshop and H&M and Pandora. Trinity Walk has enabled Wakefield to rise 42 places, from 99th, in the CACI Retail Footprint rankings, making the city centre a sub-regional shopping destination.|$|R
50|$|Stadsroutes (city routes) form {{a network}} of {{numbered}} arterials that connect parts of a city to a <b>ring</b> <b>road</b> or motorways running outside the city. City routes are signposted prefixed by an s and numbered from 100 or 101. When there is an s 100 present, it is an <b>inner</b> city <b>ring</b> <b>road</b> around the city centre. Stadsroutes can so far be found in six Dutch cities: Amsterdam, Rotterdam, The Hague, Almere, Zaanstad and Nijmegen. Nijmegen has only its s 100 centre ring operational, but other routes are in progress.Contrary the way motorways and N-roads are numbered, city routes are not a national system. The same numbers {{can be used in}} every partaking city and are therefore not unique. Many other Dutch cities have constructed <b>inner</b> city <b>ring</b> arterials without numbering them (yet).|$|R
