5|$|For {{the first}} few hours after the mudflow hit, she was covered by {{concrete}} but got her hand {{through a crack in}} the debris. After a rescuer noticed her hand protruding from a pile of debris, he and others cleared tiles and wood {{over the course of a}} day. Once the girl was freed from the waist up, her rescuers attempted to pull her out, but found the task impossible without breaking her legs in the process. Each time a person pulled her, the water pooled around her, rising so that <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>she</b> would drown if they let her go, so rescue workers placed a tire around her body to keep her afloat. Divers discovered that Sánchez's legs were caught under a door made of bricks, with her aunt's arms clutched tightly around her legs and feet.|$|E
5|$|On 5 December 1942, Graf Zeppelin was towed back to Kiel {{and placed}} in a {{floating}} drydock. <b>It</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>she</b> might well see completion after all, but by late January 1943 Hitler had become so disenchanted with the Kriegsmarine, especially with what he perceived as the poor performance of its surface fleet, that he ordered all of its larger ships taken out of service and scrapped. Raeder was shortly relieved of command and replaced with the Commander of Submarines Karl Dönitz. Though Admiral Dönitz eventually persuaded Hitler to void most of the order, work on all new surface ships and even those nearing completion was halted, including Graf Zeppelin. On 30 January 1943, all major work on the ship ceased, though some limited, temporary work continued until March.|$|E
2500|$|A 1934 New Yorker article {{reported}} that at her execution she wore [...] "a neat Amazonian tailored suit, especially {{made for the}} occasion, {{and a pair of}} new white gloves" [...] though another account indicates she wore the same suit, low-cut blouse and tricorn hat ensemble which had been picked out by her accusers for her to wear at trial, and which was still the only full, clean outfit which she had in prison. Neither description matches photographic evidence. Wales recorded her death, saying that after the volley of shots rang out, [...] "Slowly, inertly, she settled to her knees, her head up always, and without the slightest change of expression on her face. For the fraction of a second <b>it</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>she</b> tottered there, on her knees, gazing directly at those who had taken her life. Then she fell backward, bending at the waist, with her legs doubled up beneath her." [...] A non-commissioned officer then walked up to her body, pulled out his revolver, and shot her in the head to make sure she was dead.|$|E
