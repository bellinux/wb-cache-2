5|$|The outer <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> of {{darmstadtium}} {{is calculated}} to be 6d87s2, which obeys the Aufbau principle {{and does not}} follow platinum's outer <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> of 5d96s1. This {{is due to the}} relativistic stabilization of the 7s2 electron pair over the whole seventh period, so that none of the elements from 104 to 112 are expected to have electron configurations violating the Aufbau principle. The atomic radius of darmstadtium is expected to be around 132pm.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the first}} period 8 element, ununennium is {{predicted}} to be an alkali metal, below lithium, sodium, potassium, rubidium, caesium, and francium. Each of these elements has one valence electron in the outermost s-orbital (valence <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> ns1), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +1 oxidation state: thus the alkali metals are very reactive elements. Ununennium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> of 8s1. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkali metals in some properties.|$|E
5|$|Being {{the second}} period 8 element, unbinilium is {{predicted}} to be an alkaline earth metal, below beryllium, magnesium, calcium, strontium, barium, and radium. Each of these elements has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital (valence <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> ns2), which is easily lost in chemical reactions to form the +2 oxidation state: thus the alkaline earth metals are rather reactive elements, {{with the exception of}} beryllium due to its small size. Unbinilium is predicted to continue the trend and have a valence <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> of 8s2. It is therefore expected to behave much like its lighter congeners; however, it is also predicted to differ from the lighter alkaline earth metals in some properties.|$|E

5|$|Despite the {{anomalous}} <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> for gaseous thorium atoms, metallic thorium shows significant 5f involvement. This {{was first}} realised in 1995, {{when it was}} pointed out that a hypothetical metallic state of thorium that had the 6d27s2 configuration with the 5f orbitals above the Fermi level should be hexagonal close packed like the group 4 elements titanium, zirconium, and hafnium, and not face-centred cubic as it actually is. The actual crystal structure can only be explained when the 5f states are invoked, proving that thorium, and not protactinium, acts as the first actinide metallurgically. The 5f character of thorium is also clear in the rare and highly unstable +3 oxidation state, in which thorium exhibits the <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> 5f1.|$|E

5|$|In 1988, {{a team of}} {{scientists}} led by Eichler calculated that lawrencium's enthalpy of adsorption on metal sources would differ enough depending on its <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> that it would be feasible to carry out experiments to exploit this fact to measure lawrencium's <b>electron</b> <b>configuration.</b> The s2p configuration was expected to be more volatile than the s2d configuration, and be more {{similar to that of the}} p-block element lead. No evidence for lawrencium being volatile was obtained and the lower limit for the enthalpy of adsorption of lawrencium on quartz or platinum was significantly higher than the estimated value for the s2p configuration.|$|E

5|$|Calcium {{is a very}} ductile silvery metal with a {{pale yellow}} tint whose {{properties}} {{are very similar to}} the heavier elements in its group, strontium, barium, and radium. A calcium atom has twenty electrons, arranged in the <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> 4s2. Like the other elements placed in group 2 of the periodic table, calcium has two valence electrons in the outermost s-orbital, which are very easily lost in chemical reactions to form a dipositive ion with the stable <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> of a noble gas, in this case argon. Hence, calcium is almost always divalent in its compounds, which are usually ionic. Hypothetical univalent salts of calcium would be stable with respect to their elements, but not to disproportionation to the divalent salts and calcium metal, because the enthalpy of formation of MX2 is much higher than those of the hypothetical MX. This occurs because of the much greater lattice energy afforded by the more highly charged Ca2+ cation compared to the hypothetical Ca+ cation.|$|E
5|$|Fluorine atoms {{have nine}} {{electrons}}, one fewer than neon, and <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> 1s22s22p5: two electrons in a filled inner shell and seven in an outer shell requiring one {{more to be}} filled.

5|$|Hydrogen, {{like the}} alkali metals, has one valence {{electron}} and reacts easily with the halogens, but the similarities end {{there because of}} the small size of a bare proton H+ compared to the alkali metal cations.

5|$|Lanthanum {{chemistry}} tends not {{to involve}} π bonding {{due to the}} <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> of the element: thus its organometallic chemistry is quite limited.

5|$|Rutherfordium is {{expected}} to have the <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> 5f14 6d2 7s2 and therefore behave as the heavier homologue of hafnium in group 4 of the periodic table.

5|$|The <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> or {{organisation}} {{of electrons}} orbiting neutral atoms shows a recurring pattern or periodicity. The electrons occupy {{a series of}} electron shells (numbered shell 1, shell 2, and so on). Each shell consists {{of one or more}} subshells (named s, p, d, f and g). As atomic number increases, electrons progressively fill these shells and subshells more or less according to the Madelung rule or energy ordering rule, as shown in the diagram. The <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> for neon, for example, is 1s2 2s2 2p6. With an atomic number of ten, neon has two electrons in the first shell, and eight electrons in the second shell—two in the s subshell and six in the p subshell. In periodic table terms, the first time an electron occupies a new shell corresponds to the start of each new period, these positions being occupied by hydrogen and the alkali metals.|$|E
5|$|Like other groups, {{the members}} of this family show {{patterns}} in their <b>electron</b> <b>configurations,</b> especially the outermost shells, resulting in trends in chemical behavior.

5|$|With the {{development}} of modern quantum mechanical theories of <b>electron</b> <b>configurations</b> within atoms, {{it became apparent that}} each period (row) in the table corresponded to the filling of a quantum shell of electrons.

This layer helps prevent further reaction with air and water.|$|E
5|$|A {{complete}} explanation of mercury's extreme volatility delves {{deep into the}} realm of quantum physics, but it can be summarized as follows: mercury has a unique <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> where electrons fill up all the available 1s, 2s, 2p, 3s, 3p, 3d, 4s, 4p, 4d, 4f, 5s, 5p, 5d, and 6s subshells. Because this configuration strongly resists removal of an electron, mercury behaves similarly to noble gases, which form weak bonds and hence melt at low temperatures.|$|E
5|$|A {{neptunium}} atom has 93 electrons, {{arranged in}} the configuration 5f46d17s2. This {{differs from the}} configuration expected by the Aufbau principle in that one electron is in the 6d subshell instead of being as expected in the 5f subshell. This {{is because of the}} similarity of the electron energies of the 5f, 6d, and 7s subshells. In forming compounds and ions, all the valence electrons may be lost, leaving behind an inert core of inner electrons with the <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> of the noble gas radon; more commonly, only some of the valence electrons will be lost. The <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> for the tripositive ion Np3+ is 5f4, with the outermost 7s and 6d electrons lost first: this is exactly analogous to neptunium's lanthanide homolog promethium, and conforms to the trend set by the other actinides with their 5fn electron configurations in the tripositive state. The first ionization potential of neptunium was measured to be at most (6.19±0.12)eV in 1974, {{based on the assumption that}} the 7s electrons would ionize before 5f and 6d; more recent measurements have refined this to 6.2657eV.|$|E

5|$|A {{thallium}} atom has 81 electrons, {{arranged in}} the <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> 4f145d106s26p1; of these, the three outermost electrons {{in the sixth}} shell are valence electrons. Due to the inert pair effect, the 6s electron pair is relativistically stabilised and {{it is more difficult}} to get them involved in chemical bonding than for the heavier elements. Thus, very few electrons are available for metallic bonding, similar to the neighboring elements mercury and lead, and hence thallium, like its congeners, is a soft, highly electrically conducting metal with a low melting point of 304°C.|$|E
5|$|Chemistry {{experiments}} {{have confirmed that}} lawrencium behaves as a heavier homolog to lutetium in the periodic table, and is a trivalent element. It thus could also be classified as {{the first of the}} 7th-period transition metals: however, its <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> is anomalous for its position in the periodic table, having an s2p configuration instead of the s2d configuration of its homolog lutetium. This means that lawrencium may be more volatile than expected for its position in the periodic table and have a volatility comparable to that of lead.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the change}} in <b>electron</b> <b>configuration,</b> unbiunium is not {{expected}} to behave chemically very differently from its lighter congeners. A 2016 calculation on unbiunium monofluoride (UbuF) showed similarities between the valence orbitals of unbiunium in this molecule and those of actinium in actinium monofluoride (AcF); in both molecules, the highest occupied molecular orbital is expected to be nonbonding, unlike in the superficially more similar nihonium monofluoride (NhF) where it is bonding. Nihonium has the <b>electron</b> <b>configuration</b> 5f146d107s27p1, with an s2p valence configuration. Unbiunium may hence be somewhat like lawrencium in having an anomalous s2p configuration from relativistic effects that does not affect its chemistry: the bond dissociation energies, bond lengths, and polarisabilities of the UbuF molecule are expected to continue the trend down group 3. Hence lawrencium and unbiunium are expected to be similar to lutetium and actinium respectively, and not thallium and nihonium as would be expected from looking at their electron configurations. The Ubu–F bond is expected to be strong and polarised, just like for the lighter group 3 monofluorides.|$|E
