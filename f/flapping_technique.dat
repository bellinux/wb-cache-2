The present study analyzed the changes in NAC sensitivity after mammaplasties performed using the cross <b>flap</b> <b>technique</b> (Sperli’s technique). Me thods: A descriptive, analytical, and retrospective study was conducted including 14 women between 20 and 60 years of age who underwent reduction mammaplasty with the cross <b>flap</b> <b>technique.</b> The patients had grades I, II, and III breast ptosis without hypertrophy or with small to medium hypertrophies. Results: In a subjective sen sitivity and nipple contraction analysis, 12 (85. 7 %) patients reported a total return of NAC sen-sitivity 6 months after surgery. One year after surgery, all patients reported the return of sensitivity and nipple contraction with various degrees of intensity.

Twenty patients with two bilateral gingival recessions, Miller class I or II on non-molar teeth were treated with CAF+PCM (control group) or EFT+PCM (test group). Clinical measurements of probing pocket depth (PPD), clinical attachment level (CAL), recession height (RH), keratinized tissue height (KTH), keratinized mucosa thickness (KMT) were determined at baseline, 3 and 6 months post-surgery. At 6 months, the mean root coverage for test group was 81. 89 %, and for control group it was 62. 80 % (p< 0. 01). The change of recession depth from baseline was statistically significant between test and control groups, with an mean of 2. 21 mm gained at the control sites and 2. 84 mm gained at the test sites (p= 0. 02).

We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients who underwent vitrectomy with inverted ILM <b>flap</b> <b>technique</b> or vitrectomy with ILM peeling. Ten patients who had been treated vitrectomy with inverted ILM <b>flap</b> <b>technique,</b> and 12 patients who had been treated vitrectomy with ILM peeling were analyzed. We evaluated changes in best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) before and after surgery, closing rates of MH, and retinal reattachment rates and compared between both groups.

30|$|Breast {{reconstruction}} methods using autologous abdominal tissue {{have been}} developed to maximize the vascular perfusion of the flap, {{in order to reduce the}} incidence of partial flap loss, fat necrosis, and donor site morbidity. Based on the improvements in microsurgical techniques, a large proportion of breast reconstruction procedures have been performed using the free TRAM flap, free deep inferior epigastric perforators, and free superficial inferior epigastric artery flaps. However, these free <b>flap</b> <b>techniques</b> require skilled microsurgeons, as well as specially educated doctors and nurses to perform postoperative flap monitoring, and the risk of total flap loss should be considered when attempting these techniques. Thus, the use of free <b>flap</b> <b>techniques</b> may be limited, depending on the center’s clinical setting (Kotti 2014; Kanchwala and Bucky 2008 a). In contrast, breast reconstruction using the pedicled TRAM flap has a relatively easy learning curve (vs. the free flap), does not require special postoperative flap monitoring, and is a very stable procedure, with a flap survival rate of up to 99.8  % (Kim et al. 2009). However, the pedicled TRAM flap has a higher incidence of fat necrosis, compared to free <b>flap</b> <b>techniques</b> (Kim et al. 2007, 2009), and flap insetting can be limited, depending on the pedicle. This may lead to less optimal aesthetic outcomes, compared to those for the free <b>flap</b> <b>techniques.</b> Therefore, we devised a more effective method for processing zones 2 and 4 (selective salvage), based on the vascular anatomy of the pedicled TRAM flap, in order to reduce the incidence of fat necrosis and achieve superior aesthetic outcomes.|$|R

We investigated whether a factor exists that can aid in {{the determination of the}} preferred technique between the early Limberg flap and Karydakis <b>flap</b> <b>techniques</b> for treating recurrent pilonidal sinus. MATERIALS AND METHODS: This prospective and randomized study enrolled 71 patients with recurrent pilonidal sinus in whom the Limberg flap or Karydakis <b>flap</b> <b>techniques</b> were applied for reconstruction after excision. Patients were divided into two groups as follows: 37 patients were treated with the Limberg <b>flap</b> <b>technique</b> and 34 patients were treated with the Karydakis <b>flap</b> <b>technique.</b> Fluid collection, wound infection, flap edema, hematoma, partial wound separation, return to daily activities, pain score, complete healing time, painless seating and patient satisfaction were compared between the groups. ClinicalTrial. gov: NCT 02287935. RESULTS: The development rates of total fluid collection, wound infection, flap edema, hematoma, and partial wound separation were 9. 8 %, 16 %, 7 %, 15 % and 4. 2 %, respectively; total flap necrosis was not observed in any patient (p< 0. 001). During the average follow-up of 28 months, no patients (0 %) developed recurrent disease. The two groups differed with respect to early surgical complications (p< 0. 001). CONCLUSION: In this study, use of the Limberg flap was associated with lower complication rates, shorter length of hospital stay, early return to work, low pain score, high patient satisfaction and better complete healing duration. Therefore, we recommend the Limberg flap for treatment of recurrent pilonidal sinus...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{report a}} case of the {{expansion}} of submacular retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) atrophy after using the inverted internal limiting membrane (ILM) <b>flap</b> <b>technique</b> for a persisting, large, stage IV macular hole (MH). Case Report: A 79 -year-old woman presented with a chronic large MH that remained open despite pars plana vitrectomy (PPV). The surgery was performed twice for the MH closure 14 years earlier. ILM peeling was not performed during the previous surgeries. The best-corrected visual acuity (BCVA) with the Landolt ring chart was 0. 08 at her visit. The minimum MH diameter was 1, 240 μm. Inverted ILM <b>flap</b> <b>technique</b> with 20 % SF 6 gas tamponade was performed for the MH closure. For the inverted ILM <b>flap</b> <b>technique,</b> 25 -gauge PPV and ILM staining with indocyanine green were used. The ILM was peeled off for 2 disc diameters around the MH, but the ILM was not removed completely. The ILM was then inverted and covered the MH. Results: One month after surgery, the MH was closed, accompanied by glial cell proliferation spreading from the inverted ILM flap (as reported before). On the other hand, the area of the submacular RPE atrophy, which was already observed 1 week after surgery, gradually increased in size. BCVA improved to 0. 3 six months after the surgery. Conclusions: The inverted ILM <b>flap</b> <b>technique</b> may be promising even for persisting large MH which were not closed in previous surgeries, but long-term observation is needed because the detailed behavior of the inverted ILM and the Müller cells after surgery is not yet known...|$|R
