5|$|Nos. 607 and 609 Squadrons {{engaged the}} Germans {{south-west}} of The Needles. The British reported 30–40 Bf 110s with 15 Do 17s in support. The tonnage of bombs dropped suggested {{there were fewer}} bombers than claimed. The RAF fighters claimed four Do 17s. The fact remains that the Germans penetrated the airspace without interception and {{came very close to}} inflicting critical damage to the Spitfire factory. The radar had <b>done</b> <b>its</b> job and alerted No. 11 and 10 Group 20 minutes before the bombs started to fall. The fault lay either with the No. 10 or 11 Group controllers who were late in ordering their Squadrons to scramble.|$|E

25|$|For many revolutionary figures, Marie Antoinette was {{the symbol}} of {{what was wrong with}} the old regime in France. The onus of having caused the {{financial}} difficulties of the nation were placed on her shoulders by the revolutionary tribunal, and under the new republican ideas of {{what it meant to be}} a member of a nation, her Austrian descent and continued correspondence with the competing nation made her a traitor. The people of France saw her death as a necessary step toward completing the revolution. Furthermore, her execution was seen as a sign that the revolution had <b>done</b> <b>its</b> work.|$|E
25|$|In 2002 the World Monuments Fund placed Stowe House on its List of Most Endangered Sites. The {{school had}} <b>done</b> <b>its</b> {{best to keep}} the house in good repair, {{including}} re-roofing the State Dining Room in 1990, repair of the north elevation of the West Pavilion in 1992 and the repair of the Marble Saloon's oculus skylight in 1994. On taking over ownership {{of the house in}} 1997, the Stowe House Preservation Trust commissioned a survey in order to scope the problem {{and come up with a}} restoration plan. The result was a six-phase plan, starting with the most urgent work. The estimated cost in 2002 for all six phases was nearly £40 million.|$|E

25|$|The {{character}} and fortunes of Ronsard's works {{are among the}} most remarkable in literary history, and supply in themselves a kind of illustration of the progress of French literature during the last three centuries. It was long his fortune to be almost always extravagantly admired or violently attacked. At first, as has been said, the enmity, not altogether unprovoked, of the friends and followers of Marot fell to his lot, then the still fiercer antagonism of the Huguenot faction, who, happening to possess a poet of great merit in Du Bartas, were able to attack Ronsard in his tenderest point. But fate had by no means <b>done</b> <b>its</b> worst with him in his lifetime. After his death the classical reaction set in under the auspices of Malherbe, who seems to have been animated with a sort of personal hatred of Ronsard, though {{it is not clear that}} they ever met. After Malherbe, the rising glory of Corneille and his contemporaries obscured the tentative and unequal work of the Pléiade, which was, moreover, directly attacked by Boileau himself, the dictator of French criticism in the last half of the 17th century.|$|E

500|$|Pierce {{recalled}} Lane in May {{and replaced}} him with David Meriwether of Kentucky. [...] Meriwether was given orders {{to stay out}} of the Mesilla Valley until negotiations with Mexico could be completed. [...] With the encouragement of Davis, Pierce also appointed James Gadsden to negotiate with Mexico over the acquisition of additional territory. [...] Secretary of State William L. Marcy gave Gadsden clear instructions: he was to secure the Mesilla Valley for the purposes of building a railroad through it, convince Mexico that the US had <b>done</b> <b>its</b> best regarding the Indian raids, and elicit Mexican cooperation in efforts by US citizens to build a canal or railroad across the isthmus of Tehuantepec. [...] Supporting the Sloo interests was not part of the instructions.|$|E
500|$|The Suez Canal, {{opened in}} 1869, cut weeks and {{thousands}} of miles off the journey between Britain and India; in 1875, approximately 80% of the ships using the canal were British. In the event of another rebellion in India, or of a Russian invasion, the time saved at Suez might be crucial. [...] Built by French interests, much of the ownership and bonds in the canal remained in their hands, {{though some of the}} stock belonged to Isma'il Pasha, the Khedive of Egypt, who was noted for his profligate spending. The canal was losing money, and an attempt by Ferdinand de Lesseps, builder of the canal, to raise the tolls had fallen through when the Khedive had threatened to use military force to prevent it, and had also attracted Disraeli's attention. The Khedive governed Egypt under the Ottoman Empire; as in the Crimea, the issue of the Canal raised the Eastern Question of {{what to do about the}} decaying empire governed from Constantinople. With much of the pre-canal trade and communications between Britain and India passing through the Ottoman Empire, Britain had <b>done</b> <b>its</b> best to prop up the Ottomans against the threat that Russia would take Constantinople, cutting those communications, and giving Russian ships unfettered access to the Mediterranean. The French might also threaten those lines from colonies in Syria. Britain had had the opportunity to purchase shares in the canal but had declined to do so.|$|E

2500|$|The bird {{skeleton}} {{is highly}} adapted for flight. It is extremely lightweight but {{strong enough to}} withstand the stresses of taking off, flying, and landing. One key adaptation is the fusing of bones into single ossifications, such as the pygostyle. Because of this, birds usually have {{a smaller number of}} bones than other terrestrial vertebrates. Birds also lack teeth or even a true jaw, instead having a beak, which is far more lightweight. [...] The beaks of many baby birds have a projection called an egg tooth, which facilitates their exit from the amniotic egg, and that falls off once it has <b>done</b> <b>its</b> job.|$|E

[...] Proponents of {{this line of reasoning}} suggest that either all of the conceptions of God or gods throughout history truly boil down to just a small set of [...] "genuine options", or that if Pascal's Wager can simply bring a person to believe in [...] "generic theism" [...] it has <b>done</b> <b>its</b> job.|$|E
