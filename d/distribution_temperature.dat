50|$|Rachie & Roberts (1974) classed ricebean as {{adapted to}} subhumid regions with 1000-1500 mm precipitation, {{although}} {{they noted that}} other factors were also involved in adaptation, for example rainfall pattern, moisture <b>distribution,</b> <b>temperature,</b> cloud cover and relative humidity, soil characteristics, pests and diseases. They noted the importance of human needs in assessing adaptation - for example taste, {{the need for a}} particular use, or market price. Average yields were between 200 and 300 kg ha−1, although with the potential for 1200 kg ha−1, the crop would grow on a range of soils, and was resistant to pests and diseases. It would mature in as little as 60 days, and although performing well under humid conditions, was also tolerant to drought (NAS 1979) and high temperatures. It is tolerant to some degree of waterlogging, although the young plants appear to be susceptible (de Carvallho & Veira, 1996). Ricebean is also known to be tolerant to acid soils (Dwivedi, 1996). Shattering is a problem in comparison with other grain legumes, and can be particularly serious under conditions of frequent wetting and drying.|$|E
