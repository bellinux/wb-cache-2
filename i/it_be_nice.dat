500|$|Finally, in mid-August, the Persian {{army was}} sighted across the Malian Gulf {{approaching}} Thermopylae. With the Persian army's arrival at Thermopylae the Greeks held a council of war. Some Peloponnesians suggested withdrawal to the Isthmus of Corinth and blocking the passage to Peloponnesus. The Phocians and Locrians, whose states were located nearby, became indignant and advised defending Thermopylae and sending for more help. Leonidas calmed the panic {{and agreed to}} defend Thermopylae. According to Plutarch, {{when one of the}} soldiers complained that, [...] "Because of the arrows of the barbarians it is impossible to see the sun", Leonidas replied, [...] "Won't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice,</b> then, if we shall have shade in which to fight them?" [...] Herodotus reports a similar comment, but attributes it to Dienekes.|$|E
500|$|Flower was {{developed}} as a spiritual successor to Flow, a 2006 Flash game created by Jenova Chen and Nicholas Clark while the two were students at the University of Southern California. Flow was later developed into a PlayStation 3 game by Thatgamecompany in 2007 and a PlayStation Portable game by SuperVillain Studios in 2008. Flower was Thatgamecompany's [...] "first game outside the safety net of academia". It was first announced at the Tokyo Game Show on September 24, 2007, and was released on the PlayStation Network on February 12, 2009. Flower was intended primarily to provoke positive emotions in the player, and to act as [...] "an emotional shelter". Six to nine people were involved at varying stages of development. Chen, who co-founded Thatgamecompany with game producer Kellee Santiago, was the creative director {{in charge of the}} game, while Clark was the lead designer. Chen described the game as [...] "an interactive poem exploring the tension between urban and nature". He decided on the [...] "nature" [...] theme early in the development process, saying that he [...] "had this concept that every PlayStation is like a portal in your living room, it leads you to somewhere else. I thought; wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> if it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature".|$|E

The company ranged in size from six to nine people at varying stages of the game's development.

I thought; wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> if it was a portal that would allow you to be embraced by nature." [...] Chen designed the game around the idea that the primary purpose of entertainment products like video games was the feelings that they evoked in the audience, and that the emotional range of most games was very limited. To make Flower have the [...] "emotional spectrum" [...] that he wanted, Chen looked at the development process as creating a work of art, rather than a [...] "fun" [...] game, which would not provoke the desired emotions. In 2008, during Flowers development, Chen was named to the MIT Technology Review TR35 {{as one of the top}} 35 innovators in the world under the age of 35.|$|E

500|$|Finding {{accommodation}} {{was one of}} {{the greatest}} challenges faced by black travelers. Not only did many hotels, motels, and boarding houses refuse to serve black customers, but thousands of towns across the United States declared themselves [...] "sundown towns," [...] which all non-whites had to leave by sunset. Huge numbers of towns across the country were effectively off-limits to African Americans. By the end of the 1960s, there were at least 10,000 sundown towns across the U.S.– including large suburbs such as Glendale, California (population 60,000 at the time); Levittown, New York (80,000); and Warren, Michigan (180,000). Over half the incorporated communities in Illinois were sundown towns. The unofficial slogan of Anna, Illinois, which had violently expelled its African-American population in 1909, was [...] "Ain't No Niggers Allowed". Even in towns which did not exclude overnight stays by blacks, accommodations were often very limited. African Americans migrating to California to find work in the early 1940s often found themselves camping by the roadside overnight for lack of any hotel accommodation along the way. They were acutely aware of the discriminatory treatment that they received. Courtland Milloy's mother, who took him and his brother on road trips when they were children, recalled that [...] "after riding all day, I'd say to myself, 'Wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> if we could spend the night in one of those hotels?' or, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could stop for a real meal and a cup of coffee?' We'd see the little white children jumping into motel swimming pools, and you all would be in the back seat of a hot car, sweating and fighting." ...|$|E

2500|$|Four {{days after}} the attack, the White House team that visited Beirut, led by Vice President of the United States, George H. W.

Jerry Falwell's [...] "Baptist Fundamentalism '84" [...] convention, in Washington, DC. During the {{delivery}} of the speech, President Reagan was interrupted by a small group of protestors, armed with pre-printed banners, chanting, [...] "Bread, not bombs." [...] Reagan, {{at the height of his}} powers as [...] "the great communicator," [...] deftly handles the situation, at one point commenting, [...] "Wouldn't <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>nice</b> if a little bit of that Marine spirit would rub off, and they would listen [...] about brotherly love?" ...|$|E

I've never known where one started and where one stopped." [...] As for the idealized TV family on Leave It to Beaver, which continues in reruns on cable {{more than half a century}} after its debut, Billingsley had her own explanation for the Cleavers' enduring appeal.

While there is, of course, the resultant publicity that comes with any new or returning soap character being announced, the storyline possibilities for Ricky and Bianca arriving back in the Square are good. Bianca is turning up with a brood of kids in tow, all belonging to different fathers (how many of them can we expect to see {{over the next couple of}} years?). Like it! Ricky arrives with a glamorous WAG [...] on his arm. [...] I sense friction along the way, especially when Ricky realises he never got over Bianca (how could he?).
