25|$|In {{the reactor}} core, {{high-pressure}} systems cycle water between the {{reactor pressure vessel}} and heat exchangers. These systems transfer heat to a secondary heat exchanger via the essential service water system, using water pumped out to sea or an onsite cooling tower. Units 2 and 3 were equipped with steam turbine-driven emergency core cooling systems that could be <b>directly</b> <b>operated</b> by steam produced by decay heat, and which could inject water directly into the reactor. Some electrical power was needed to operate valves and monitoring systems.|$|E

500|$|Despite {{selling the}} company, Sanders {{retained}} significant moral authority over executives and franchisees, {{and made his}} feelings clear when he disagreed with corporate decisions. When Massey moved company headquarters from Kentucky to Nashville, Tennessee, Sanders was quoted as saying, [...] "This ain't no goddam Tennessee Fried Chicken, no matter what some slick, silk-suited son-of-a-bitch says". He believed {{that the company had}} reneged on their contract with him when they opened operations in Canada, arguing that the contract had granted him the exclusive rights to operate there. KFC was forced to renegotiate with Sanders regarding the Canadian activities, as he owned $1.5 million worth of stock and was using it to prevent Massey from listing the company publicly until his points of issue were addressed. Brown and Massey claimed that Sanders only had the rights to process chicken in Canada. After they renegotiated the contract to guarantee Sanders exclusive rights over Canada, he sold his stock to them, and the company went public in 1966. After going public, the company bought out its 600 franchisees, and <b>directly</b> <b>operated</b> them itself. Later that year, Massey resigned from day-to-day management of the company (although he remained as chairman), and Brown announced that headquarters would be moved to Louisville, Kentucky.|$|E

2500|$|Following Gordon Brown's {{appointment}} as Prime Minister in 2007, Andrew Adonis was appointed Transport Secretary. [...] He immediately {{began work on}} {{plans for a new}} high-speed route between London and Birmingham (later known as High Speed 2), which would augment the West Coast Main Line. [...] Adonis also announced plans to electrify the Great Western Main Line from London as far as Swansea, as well as infill electrification schemes in the North West of England to remove diesel traction from certain key routes. [...] Late in 2009, the InterCity East Coast franchise collapsed {{for the second time in}} three years when incumbent operator National Express East Coast (NXEC) proved unable to meet its financial obligations.

2500|$|Land {{ambulance}} service provision {{is funded by}} the national government, and provided by means of one of the four Regional Health Authorities (Southern and Eastern Norway Regional Health Authority, Southern Norway Regional Health Authority, Western Norway Regional Health Authority, and Northern Norway Regional Health Authority) which provide most healthcare in Norway. [...] Services may be provided directly by the Trust or its member hospitals, but are typically outsourced. [...] In many locations in Norway, the provision of land {{ambulance service}} is contracted to private operators, most typically large scale transportation companies operating a variety of types of service. [...] Namsos Trafikkselskap (NTS) {{is an example of a}} private company participating in this type of arrangement for service delivery. [...] While the majority of such arrangements are currently with Norwegian-based companies, this is changing, and international companies, such as Falck are beginning to contract for services in some areas. [...] Such services may operate 24 hours per day in larger centers, but in remote and rural locations are still frequently staffed by 'on-call' personnel after normal business hours. [...] Even in areas with <b>directly</b> <b>operated</b> emergency ambulances, non-emergency transportation is more likely to be conducted by commercial transportation companies. [...] Norway currently operates on the Franco-German model of EMS care, with some limitations on the permitted skills of EMS personnel, and physician response to emergencies being quite commonplace.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Endogenous oxygen- and nitrogen-centered free {{radicals}} {{are considered to}} play a decisive role {{in a variety of}} diseases such as neurodegenerative disorders, atherosclerosis, or cancer. <b>Directly</b> <b>operating</b> antioxidants limit the action of freely diffusing radicals by scavenging the attacking, oxidizing radical and rereducing the oxidized biomolecule, i. e., the biomolecule-derived radical. From textbooks of biochemistry it is understood that NAD(P) H acts as a hydride (hydrogen anion) donor in a variety of enzymatic processes. One example is the re-reduction of GSSG to GSH, catalyzed by glutathione reductase. Because of this reaction, NADPH has been suggested to also act as an indirectly operating antioxidant, thus maintaining the antioxidative power of glutathione. To the best of our knowledge, however, neither NADPH nor NADH has been considered to be <b>directly</b> <b>operating</b> antioxidants. Based on recently published data, new experiments, and theoretical considerations, we propose that NAD(P) H represents a decisive, <b>directly</b> <b>operating</b> antioxidant that should be considered of major importance in the mitochondrial compartment. NAD(P) H fulfills this task both by scavenging toxic {{free radicals}} and repairing biomolecule-derived radicals. —Kirsch, M., de Groot, H.
