5|$|Paleomagnetic orientations from beds of tephra (volcanic ash) {{that lie}} between {{the layers of}} the Touchet Formation show secular variation, which {{indicates}} that the beds must have been formed by many floods. The purity of the tephra suggests subaerial deposition (the tephra could be mixed with the surrounding sediment if it was deposited in moving water), which indicates a <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> during the ash falls (and hence a hiatus between floods).|$|E
5|$|The {{community}} that constructed the trackway were Neolithic farmers who had colonised {{the area around}} 3900 BC, and {{the evidence suggests that}} they were, by the time of construction, well organised and settled. Before this human incursion, the uplands surrounding the levels were heavily wooded, but local inhabitants began to clear these forests about this time to make way for an economy that was predominately pastoral with small amounts of cultivation. During the winter, the flooded areas of the levels would have provided this fishing, hunting, foraging and farming community with abundant fish and wildfowl; in the summer, the drier areas provided rich, open grassland for grazing cattle and sheep, reeds, wood, and timber for construction, and abundant wild animals, birds, fruit, and seeds. The need to reach the islands in the bog was sufficiently pressing for them to mount the enormous communal activity required for the task of stockpiling the timber and building the trackway, presumably when the waters were at their lowest after a <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> The work required for the construction of the track demonstrates that they had advanced woodworking skills and suggests some differentiation of occupation among the workers. They also appear to have been managing the surrounding woodland for at least 120 years.|$|E
5|$|The {{quality of}} Malvern water is {{attributable}} to its source. Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest rocks found in the United Kingdom, with their geology responsible {{for the quality of}} Malvern's spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as 36 litres (8 gallons) per minute to over 350 litres (77 gallons) per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, {{while at the same time}} the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
40|$|The drying test {{of sweet}} potato {{has been done}} at the air {{conditions}} of 40, 50, 60, and 75 ℃, in order to investigate the drying characteristics. In this study, three types of <b>drying</b> <b>periods,</b> the constant rate <b>drying</b> <b>period,</b> the first falling rate <b>drying</b> <b>period,</b> and the second falling rate <b>drying</b> <b>period,</b> was found during drying. With regards to this, three drying equations, the modified constant rate drying equation, the first falling rate drying equation, and the second falling rate drying equation were applied to the observed drying curve (moisture ratio vs. time) for each <b>drying</b> <b>period</b> respectively.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} model describing {{the course of}} drying curve of single parsley root particles under conditions of natural convection was formulated {{on the basis of}} the general theory of heat and mass transfer laws. The course of the drying curve was described in two ways: using the linear model of the first <b>drying</b> <b>period</b> (without shrinkage) and then using the models of second <b>drying</b> <b>period</b> and the models of first <b>drying</b> <b>period</b> taking into account shrinkage and finally the models of second <b>drying</b> <b>period.</b> The second <b>drying</b> <b>period</b> was described in both cases by the same models which approximated the shape of dried particles as follows: infinite plane (slices cut crosswise and along the root, axial cylinder slices), finite cylinder (slices cut crosswise the root, axial cylinder slices), finite in two dimensions plane (bark rings), infinite cylinder (bark rings). The verification confirmed that the following {{mathematical model}}s describe the course of drying curve with satisfactory accuracy: for crosswise and lengthwise slices and axial cylinder slices – the linear model or models with shrinkage in the first <b>drying</b> <b>period</b> and the model of infinite plane in the second <b>drying</b> <b>period,</b> for bark rings – the linear model or models with shrinkage in the first <b>drying</b> <b>period</b> and the model of finite plane in the second <b>drying</b> <b>period.</b> The values of relative error were not higher than: 1 % for linear model, 4 % for models with shrinkage, 29 % for models of the infinite and finite plane drying. The results of modelling pointed out the need of the model formulation of moisture content changes in parsley root particles <b>dried</b> in transition <b>period.</b> The results obtained allowed the statement that parsley root can be regarded as an anisotropic and heterogeneous body.

40|$|CUSUM (cumulative {{deviations}} from the mean) analysis of up to 136 years of annual rainfall at 15 stations {{in the northern part}} of the Northern Territory (Australia) revealed alternating periods of above- and below-average rainfall that persisted for at least 6 years to many decades.

25|$|Some {{important}} concepts: A {{formation is}} a formally named and defined geologic unit with unique characteristics. Those characteristics were created during a largely unbroken {{period of time}} and result from the specific depositional environment that the formation was laid down in. A member is a minor unit in a formation and a bed is a distinct subunit of a member. Groups are sets of formations that are related in significant ways such as, for example, all being deposited during a <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> that lasted millions of years or as the result of an ocean periodically flooding the same area over millions of years.|$|E
25|$|Orthalicus reses reses snails {{are active}} mainly during the wet season, i.e. May through November, {{during which time}} breeding, feeding, and {{dispersal}} takes place. Dry periods (December through April) are spent in aestivation, during which time the snail forms a tight sealed barrier between the aperture and a tree trunk or branch. Snails secrete this mucus seal (an epiphragm) that cements their shell to a tree {{in order to protect}} them from desiccation during the <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> Snails may come out of aestivation briefly to feed during dry-season rains, and also may go into aestivation during summer dry spells.|$|E

25|$|Producers will {{typically}} {{continue to}} milk the cow until she is two {{months away from}} parturition then they will dry her off. Giving the cow a break during {{the final stages of}} pregnancy allows her mammary gland to regress and re-develop, her body condition to recover, and the calf to develop normally. Decreased body condition in the cow means she will not be as productive in subsequent milk cycles. Decreased health in the new born calf will negatively impact the quality of the replacement herd. There is also evidence that increased rates of mammary cell proliferation occur during the <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> that is essential to maintaining high production levels in subsequent lactation cycles.|$|E
25|$|Tbilisi has a humid {{subtropical}} (Köppen climate classification Cfa) {{with considerable}} continental (Dfa) influences. The city experiences very warm summers and moderately cold winters. Like {{other regions of}} Georgia, Tbilisi receives significant rainfall throughout the year with no distinct <b>dry</b> <b>period.</b> The city's climate is influenced both by dry (Central Asian/Siberian) air masses from the east and oceanic (Atlantic/Black Sea) air masses from the west. Because the city is bounded on most sides by mountain ranges, the close proximity to large bodies of water (Black and Caspian Seas) {{and the fact that}} the Greater Caucasus Mountains Range (further to the north) blocks the intrusion of cold air masses from Russia, Tbilisi has a relatively mild microclimate compared to other cities that possess a similar climate along the same latitudes.|$|E
500|$|The {{existence}} of Lake Tauca {{was preceded by}} a <b>dry</b> <b>period,</b> with minor lake events recorded in Salar de Uyuni in the Late Pleistocene at 28,200–30,800 and 31,800–33,400 BP. The earlier Lake Minchin formed {{at the site of}} Lake Tauca. This period was accompanied by the disappearance of ice from Nevado Sajama. A <b>dry</b> <b>period</b> is also noted in Africa and other parts of South America around 18,000 BP, and the retreat of the Amazon rainforest may have produced the lake low-water mark. The era may have been drier than the present. The drying of Lake Minchin left a salt layer about [...] thick in the Salar de Uyuni, where gullies formed. Some ooid sediments formed before the Lake Tauca phase. Around 28,000 BP, lake levels rose in Lake Huinaymarca (Lake Titicaca's southern basin), preceding Lake Tauca by about two millennia. During this period, lakes in the Uyuni basin were intermittent. Previous lakes in the basin were generally small and shallow.|$|E

50|$|It is also {{possible}} that the inflow into an open lake could decrease so much that any outflow would dry the lake up completely — that is, the open lake would become a closed lake.
