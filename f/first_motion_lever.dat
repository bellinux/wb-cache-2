At site 6, <b>first</b> <b>motions</b> were clearly upward (compressional) for all cluster-A events; at site 7, no cluster-A events showed upward, {{and some of them}} showed clear downward first motions; and at site 1, there were both upward and downward (dilatational) <b>first</b> <b>motions.</b> If it is assumed that site 1 is near the nodal plane, these observations are consistent with the generally accepted right-lateral strike-slip on the fault plane of the NAF.|$|R

50|$|The {{earliest}} seismographs {{were designed}} to {{give a sense of}} the direction of the <b>first</b> <b>motions</b> from an earthquake. The Chinese frog seismograph would have dropped its ball in the general compass direction of the earthquake, assuming a strong positive pulse. We now know that <b>first</b> <b>motions</b> can be in almost any direction {{depending on the type of}} initiating rupture (focal mechanism).|$|R
40|$|The {{radiation}} {{patterns of}} <b>first</b> <b>motions</b> are {{calculated for the}} sudden occurrence of an arbitrarily oriented fault (dislocation) at {{the surface of a}} half space; the dislocation in the fault plane is also arbitrarily oriented and is assumed to occur over a very small area of the fault plane. Initially the source is considered at a finite depth and the solution is obtained by allowing the depth to tend to zero. In general the results show a surprising directionality for the radiation of SV. In the focal plane projection the <b>first</b> <b>motions</b> of P and SH for a strike-slip fault show the familiar four-lobed radiation patterns. The <b>first</b> <b>motions</b> of SV show some reversals in polarity with angular distance from the source. The <b>first</b> <b>motions</b> for all components of motion for a dip-slip fault have characteristics governed strongly by the presence of the free surface, and hence differ markedly from the usual radiation patterns for a deeply imbedded source...|$|R

30|$|The {{initiation}} of rupture is usually {{described by the}} <b>first</b> <b>motion</b> polarity solution. However, the rupture direction could change during large earthquakes. The entire rupturing is modeled by slip-distribution modeling, which models the waveform. Therefore, the moment tensor solution is more suitable than the <b>first</b> <b>motion</b> polarity solution in terms of representing the entire rupturing process. Additionally, the strikes of the fault planes obtained from the moment tensor solutions are more consistent with the main surface rupture. The difference between the directions of the fault planes obtained from the <b>first</b> <b>motion</b> polarity solution and the moment tensor solution indicates that {{the direction of the}} rupture initiation is different from the entire rupture propagation.|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} {{method for}} determining fault-plane solutions and estimating confidence regions from P-wave <b>first</b> <b>motion</b> data was studied. Coverage of <b>first</b> <b>motion</b> {{data on the}} focal sphere influences fault-plane solution in the conventional methods, especially in graphical methods. There are sometimes inconsistent directions of <b>first</b> <b>motion</b> which are opposite to adjacent ones though located within common areas of most directions. In the new numerical method such inconsistent <b>first</b> <b>motion</b> data are discarded in an automatic and objective way, and the confidence regions of alternative solutions of the maximum pressure (P) and (T) with scores of 95 % or greater are estimated. The new method was applied to 358 earthquakes which occurred {{in and around the}} Kanto region, Central Japan. Fault-plane solutions and their confidence regions with the scores of 95 % or greater could be obtained for 294 earthquakes (84 %) in the first run. For the remaining earthquakes, the preliminary discarding of inconsistent <b>first</b> <b>motion</b> data made it possible to determine the fault-plane solutions. Significant differences of the fault-plane solutions were observed between the best fit solutions in previous methods and those by the new method. Equally probable fault-plane solutions for the same earthquake are sometimes separated into several groups and are also observed in a wide range on the focal sphere. P波初動データによる地震メカニズム解とその信頼域の数値的解析法が改良された. 従来の方法,特に図式法では,特定の初動データがメカニズム解を左右する傾向がある. 初動方向データの中で,周囲と比較して,明らかに誤まりと思われるものがみられる場合がある. 又与えられた初動データを満足する他の解か存在する場合もある. 今回の数値解法では,与えられた初動データが客観的・自動的に判別され不良データが省かれる. 又初動データの 95 %以上を満足する主圧力軸(P,T) の信頼域も得られる. この数値解法は関東地方周辺の 358 個の地震に応用され, 294 個の地震に対して解が得られた,残りの地震(16 %) では最良のメカニズム解に対する初動データのスコアは 95 %以下である. これらの地震に対する観測点別のスコアにもとづいて,初動データを取拾選択して,メカニズム解を得ることができる. 従来の方法による"最良解"と今回の数値解には違いがみられることがある. 又代用解がいくつかのグループに分れたり,広範囲に分布する場合もみられる...|$|R
