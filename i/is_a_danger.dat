5|$|Occasionally, {{influenza}} {{can cause}} severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia. The obvious symptom is trouble breathing. In addition, {{if a child}} (or presumably an adult) {{seems to be getting}} better and then relapses with a high fever, that <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> sign since this relapse can be bacterial pneumonia.|$|E
5|$|This slow-moving but {{aggressive}} fish dominates feeding frenzies, and <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> to shipwreck or air crash survivors. Recent {{studies show}} steeply declining populations because its large fins are highly valued {{as the chief}} ingredient of shark fin soup, and as with other shark species, the whitetip faces mounting fishing pressure throughout its range.|$|E
5|$|Communication {{partners}} {{may also}} require training to notice and consistently interpret the communication signals of a severely disabled individual, particularly because there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> that learned helplessness {{can be the}} result of repeated failure to communicate successfully. Parties may need assistance to avoid the directive communication style that can lead a child user of AAC not to develop a full range of communication skills such as initiating or taking the lead in conversation, using complex syntax, asking questions, making commands or adding new information.|$|E

5|$|The shock {{delivered}} by the marbled electric ray can be painful but is seldom life-threatening, although there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of a shocked diver becoming disoriented underwater. Its electrogenic properties have been known since classical antiquity, leading it and other electric fishes {{to be used in}} medicine. The ancient Greeks and Romans applied live rays to those afflicted with conditions such as chronic headaches and gout, and recommended that its meat be eaten by epileptics.|$|E
5|$|Moira {{explains}} {{that while some}} ghosts in the house only wish for the living to suffer the same fates they did, other ghosts are innocent and {{do not wish to}} see any more bloodshed. The Harmons realize the house <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> to those living in it and resolve to protect future residents by scaring them away. Both of Moira's ghostly forms (Conroy and Alexandra Breckenridge) and other ghosts, including nurse Gladys (Celia Finkelstein), Beau (Sam Kinsey), the exterminator (W. Earl Brown), and the Black Dahlia (Mena Suvari), join the Harmons to protect the Ramoses, a new family that moved in, against malicious ghosts.|$|E
5|$|The book's {{central theme}} {{is a warning}} that, in times of strife and {{increased}} fear, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of repression and suppression of dissent by those in government who seek to limit freedom of speech. In {{an interview with the}} author, Deborah Solomon of The New York Times Magazine wrote that American politics has frequently used fear to justify repression. Lewis pointed out to Solomon that, under the Espionage Act of 1917 and the Sedition Act of 1918, individuals who protested against President Woodrow Wilson's sending of soldiers to Russia were tried and given a twenty-year jail sentence. The author explained that his motivation for writing the book was to recognize the unparalleled civil liberties in the U.S., including freedom of speech and freedom of the press. He identified reductions in freedoms of citizens as a result of governmental action taken after the September 11 attacks.|$|E

5|$|Isolation {{manifolded}} twin sets or manifolded doubles {{with two}} regulators, consist of two back mounted cylinders with their pillar valves {{connected by a}} manifold, with a valve in the manifold that can be closed to isolate the two pillar valves. In {{the event of a}} problem with one cylinder the diver may close the isolator valve to preserve gas in the cylinder which has not failed. The advantages of this configuration include: a larger gas supply than from a single cylinder; automatic balancing of the gas supply between the two cylinders; thus, no requirement to constantly change regulators underwater during the dive; and in most failure situations, the diver may close a valve to a failed regulator or isolate a cylinder and may retain access to all the remaining gas in both the tanks. The disadvantages are that the manifold is another potential point of failure, and there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of losing all gas from both cylinders if the isolation valve cannot be closed when a problem occurs. This configuration of cylinders is often used in technical diving.|$|E
25|$|Natural hazards {{include the}} heavy surf {{and the lack}} of natural harbors on the coast; during the rainy season torrential {{flooding}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger.</b>|$|E
25|$|Litter : Litter of {{all kinds}} is both {{unsightly}} and can cause pollution and damage to livestock and wild animals.

25|$|Moose {{warning signs}} are used on roads in regions where there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of {{collision}} with the animal. The triangular warning signs common in Sweden, Norway, and Finland have become coveted souvenirs among tourists traveling in these countries, causing road authorities so much expense that the moose signs {{have been replaced}} with imageless generic warning signs in some regions.|$|E
25|$|The {{killer is}} known as Leigh Emerson and becomes a patient at Briarcliff. Sister Jude (Jessica Lange) keeps him shackled, even for a group picture with the others, as she feels he <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> {{both inside and outside}} the asylum. He proves her correct as he bites off an orderly's nose on Christmas. Jude sends him to solitary {{confinement}} and canes him in her office over the course of his stay.|$|E

25|$|Some {{magnetrons}} have ceramic insulators with {{beryllium oxide}} (beryllia) added. The beryllium in such oxides {{is a serious}} chemical hazard if crushed then inhaled or ingested. In addition, beryllia is listed as a confirmed human carcinogen by the IARC; therefore, broken ceramic insulators or magnetrons should not be handled. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> if the microwave oven becomes physically damaged, if the insulator cracks, or when the magnetron is opened and handled, yet not during normal usage.|$|E

25|$|In January 2013, the Architect of the Capitol {{announced}} a four-year, $10 million project to repair and conserve the Capitol Dome's exterior and the Capitol rotunda. The proposal {{would require the}} stripping of lead paint from {{the interior of the}} dome, repair to the ironwork, repainting of the interior of the dome, rehabilitation of the interstitial space between the dome and rotunda, and installation of new lighting in the interstitial space and the rotunda. The dome and rotunda, which were last conserved in 1960, are showing significant signs of rust and disrepair. There <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> that decorative ironwork could fall from the rotunda to the space below, and that weather-related problems could damage the artwork in the rotunda. Without immediate repair, safety netting will be installed (blocking the rotunda's artwork from view).|$|E

25|$|When Warwick {{presented}} the Royal Institution Christmas Lectures entitled The Rise of Robots {{in the year}} 2000, the lectures were well received by some. However, in a letter Simon Colton complained about the choice of Warwick, prior to his appearance. He claimed that Warwick is not a spokesman for our subject (Artificial Intelligence) and allowing him influence through the Christmas lectures <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> to the public perception of science. Due to Warwick's claims that computers could be creative, Colton, who is a Reader in Computational Creativity, also said the AI community has done real science to reclaim words such as creativity and emotion which they claim computers will never have. Subsequent letters were generally positive; Ralph Rayner wrote With my youngest son, I attended all of the lectures and found them balanced and thought-provoking. They were not sensationalist. I applaud Warwick for his lectures.|$|E
25|$|The {{most common}} {{disinfection}} method involves {{some form of}} chlorine or its compounds such as chloramine or chlorine dioxide. Chlorine is a strong oxidant that rapidly kills many harmful micro-organisms. Because chlorine is a toxic gas, there <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> of a release associated with its use. This problem is avoided {{by the use of}} sodium hypochlorite, which is a relatively inexpensive solution used in household bleach that releases free chlorine when dissolved in water. Chlorine solutions can be generated on site by electrolyzing common salt solutions. A solid form, calcium hypochlorite, releases chlorine on contact with water. Handling the solid, however, requires greater routine human contact through opening bags and pouring than the use of gas cylinders or bleach which are more easily automated. The generation of liquid sodium hypochlorite is both inexpensive and safer than the use of gas or solid chlorine.|$|E
25|$|Tibesti has tourism potential, {{with its}} primary attractions being the palm groves, rock and parietal art, canyons, basalt spires, volcanoes and hot springs. However, the Zouar {{airfield}} cannot accommodate aircraft {{with more than}} a 20-seat capacity. This pushes the cost of air tickets from N'djamena up to 60 percent of the cost to fly from N'djamena to major European cities. Furthermore, tourist accommodations are virtually absent. As a result, the majority of tourists, most of whom are German, enter Libya, purchase all-terrain vehicles or caravans on the spot, and then cross the border into Chad. Thus, the economic benefits to Chad amount to only around 100 euros per tourist. The presence of numerous landmines <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> to tourists, and thus hiking is generally limited to {{the southern end of the}} range. The ascent up Emi Koussi, around the Era Kohor, and then on to Yi Yerra hot springs generally takes about three days. The volcano has been climbed by 100 westerners since 1957.|$|E
50|$|Pollution may <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>danger</b> in <b>a</b> few {{different}} ways: pesticides for misquitos killing off aquatic prey in turtle ponds, herbicides hurting aquatic vegetation, or just generalized {{water pollution}} impacting turtles.
