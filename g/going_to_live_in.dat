On Thursday, August 1, 1974, Chief of Staff Alexander Haig {{contacted}} Ford to {{tell him}} that [...] "smoking gun" [...] evidence had been found.

However, [...] "Al Haig asked to come over and see me," [...] Ford later said, [...] "to tell me that there would be a new tape released on a Monday, and he said the evidence in there was devastating and there would probably be either an impeachment or a resignation.

2500|$|Mousey (voiced by Jane Bassett) - Mousey is an {{anthropomorphic}} talking mouse {{who lives}} under the floorboards {{of the flat}} that Bodger rents from Series 5-7. She and Badger are great friends, both constantly getting up to mischief. Mousey's presence is only known by Bodger in the first episode of Series 5 when he sets traps to try to catch her. After Badger makes friends with Mousey, he deceives Simon into believing Mousey has gone from the house. When Bodger and Badger move to Puddleford to run their hotel in Series 8, Mousey moves with them and takes up residence in the airing cupboard rather than under the floorboards. Even though Badger is known to several of the human characters, Mousey is kept a secret from everyone, although Mrs Dribelle spots her on two occasions in Bodger's flat and Mrs Melly on one occasion who tried to capture {{her when she was}} disguised as a rare bird to fool Miss Piper. She appears to be a fan of royalty, especially in the episode [...] "Mrs. Dribelle and The Queen" [...] where she thinks she's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> Buckingham Palace with the Queen unaware that it is Mrs. Dribelle in disguise. When Mousey speaks, it is clear Badger understands her perfectly, however in episode 1 of series 5 it is implied Bodger can only interpret her language as the normal squeaking of a field mouse or house mouse.|$|E

50|$|The bulk of {{the book}} focuses on a British writer, Nathan, who is {{attempting}} to sell {{an idea for a}} claustrosphere commercial to Plastic Tolstoy, owner and chief marketer of the company which builds them. The commercial represents a change in emphasis for the advertising campaign; up to now claustropheres have been sold as a kind of fall-back insurance, just in case the environment collapses. However, now that virtually everybody owns at least a basic model, sales are falling and the company is having to try and sell upgrade and improvement packages instead. The new advertising, therefore, attempts to convince people {{for the first time that}} the environment truly is doomed and they are inevitably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>live</b> <b>in</b> their claustrospheres.|$|R
