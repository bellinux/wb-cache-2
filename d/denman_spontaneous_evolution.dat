40|$|AbstractObjective To analyse {{the repair}} of lesions of {{articular}} cartilage with periosteum-free implants and follow-up at 6 months. Design Thirty-six New Zealand rabbits, 4 – 6 weeks old, were used. Full-thickness articular cartilage defects in the medial femoral condyle were created. <b>Spontaneous</b> <b>evolution</b> occurred in 18 animals; the other 18 animals {{were treated with}} a free autogenous periosteal tibial implant fixed with Tissucol®. Animals were killed in groups of six at 8, 12 and 24 weeks. Macroscopic, histologic and histochemical results were evaluated and analysed statistically using the Mann-Whitney U-test. Results The <b>spontaneous</b> <b>evolution</b> of the lesion {{did not lead to}} complete repair in any case. The periosteum-free implant provided complete repair of the lesion and statistically significant restoration of the articular surface. Conclusions In the rabbit, this study confirms the incomplete spontaneous repair of articular cartilage and the chondrogenic potential of tibial periosteum-free implants, with long-term maintenance of the macroscopic, histologic and histochemical characteristics of neo-cartilage.

Based on an original experimental setup that allows for the implementation of 1 D OWT, we are able to show that an inverse cascade occurs through the <b>spontaneous</b> <b>evolution</b> of the nonlinear field up to the point when modulational instability leads to soliton formation. After solitons are formed, further interaction of the solitons among themselves and with incoherent waves leads to a final condensate state dominated by a single strong soliton.
