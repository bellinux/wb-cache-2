Diderot was based in Toulon throughout 1919 and was modernized in 1922–25 to improve her underwater protection. The ship became a training ship in 1927 and was condemned in on 17 March 1937; sold to M. Gosselin-Duriez on 30 July 1937 for 3,557,010 FF, she arrived at Dunkirk for breaking up on 31 August.|$|E

5|$|As runners-up to League champions Manchester United in the 1996 FA Cup Final, Liverpool {{were able}} {{to compete in the}} 1996–97 UEFA Cup Winners' Cup. This proved the club's most {{successful}} campaign since their return to European competition, as they reached the semi-finals, where they were eliminated 3–2 on aggregate by Paris Saint–Germain. In the next two seasons, Liverpool played in the UEFA Cup but were eliminated at an <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the competition, by Strasbourg and Celta de Vigo, respectively. A seventh-place finish in the 1998–99 FA Premier League meant the club did not qualify for Europe in 1999–2000.|$|E
5|$|In Demosthenes's initial {{judicial}} orations, {{the influence}} of both Lysias and Isaeus is obvious, but his marked, original style is already revealed. Most of his extant speeches for private cases—written early in his career—show glimpses of talent: a powerful intellectual drive, masterly selection (and omission) of facts, and a confident assertion of the justice of his case, all ensuring the dominance of his viewpoint over his rival. However, at this <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> his career, his writing was not yet remarkable for its subtlety, verbal precision and variety of effects.|$|E
5|$|Pallas {{is thought}} to have {{undergone}} at least some degree of thermal alteration and partial differentiation, which suggests that it is a remnant protoplanet. During the planetary formation stage of the Solar System, objects grew in size through an accretion process to approximately this size. Many of these objects were incorporated into larger bodies, which became the planets, whereas others were destroyed in collisions with other protoplanets. Pallas and Vesta are likely survivors from this <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> planetary formation.|$|E

5|$|The May Revolution of 1810 {{marked the}} <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> {{a process which}} later led to the {{disintegration}} of Spain's Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, independence and the eventual formation of Argentina. Rosas, like many landowners in the countryside, was suspicious of a movement advanced primarily by merchants and bureaucrats {{in the city of}} Buenos Aires. Rosas was specially outraged by the execution of Viceroy Santiago Liniers {{at the hands of the}} revolutionaries. Rosas felt nostalgic about colonial times, seeing them as stable, orderly and prosperous.|$|E

5|$|The wood used {{to build}} the track is now classed as bog-wood, the name given to wood (of any source) that for long periods (sometimes {{hundreds}} of thousands of years) has been buried in peat bogs, and kept from decaying by the acidic and anaerobic bog conditions. Bog-wood usually is stained brown by tannins dissolved in the acidic water, and represents an <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> fossilisation. The age of the track prompted large-scale excavations in 1973, funded by the Department of the Environment.|$|E
5|$|Anggun's {{image has}} been {{compared}} to that of Pocahontas. At the <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> her career as a rock singer, Anggun was known for her tomboy look—wearing a crooked beret, shorts, studded jacket, and large belt; this set a trend during the early 1990s. Later, she has focused on femininity and sexuality, emphasising her long black hair and brown skin. For this look she utilises the work of fashion designers like Azzedine Alaïa, Dolce & Gabbana, and Roberto Cavalli. In 2001, Anggun was dubbed as the sixth Sexiest Women of Asia by FHM magazine. Later in 2010, she was ranked at number 18 on the French version of FHMs list of 100 Sexiest Women in the World.|$|E
5|$|However, {{the most}} {{important}} defector to Henry in this <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the campaign was probably Rhys ap Thomas, who was the leading figure in West Wales. Richard had appointed Rhys Lieutenant in West Wales for his refusal to join Buckingham's rebellion, asking that he surrender his son Gruffydd ap Rhys ap Thomas as surety, although by some accounts Rhys had managed to evade this condition. However, Henry successfully courted Rhys, offering the lieutenancy of all Wales {{in exchange for his}} fealty. Henry marched via Aberystwyth while Rhys followed a more southerly route, recruiting a force of Welshmen en route, variously estimated at 500 or 2,000 men, to swell Henry's army when they reunited at Cefn Digoll, Welshpool,. By 15 or 16 August, Henry and his men had crossed the English border, making for the town of Shrewsbury.|$|E

5|$|The ZNG and {{the police}} {{captured}} small, isolated JNA posts, {{and a number of}} large weapons depots and barracksincluding the entire 32nd (Varaždin) Corps of the JNA. The move provided the Croatian forces with a sizable stock of weaponsincluding 250 tanks, hundreds of artillery pieces and a large supply of small arms and ammunitionwhich proved crucial in defending against JNA advances in the <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the Croatian War of Independence. Some of the JNA facilities surrendered without fighting, while others put up armed resistance to the takeover. In some places, this caused civilian casualties because the barracks were situated in urban areas. Legal charges of abuse of or killing captured JNA personnel, and charges of war crimes against civilian populations were filed in Croatia, but most defendants remain at large.|$|E
5|$|The {{area where}} Armenia lies is of {{interest}} to seismologists and geologists because of the relatively <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> continental collision occurring there and because the earthquake's strong aftershock sequence and significant surface faulting presented scientists with an environment to study reverse faulting. Twelve days after the mainshock a French-Soviet team installed a temporary seismic network in the epicentral area to record aftershock activity (a separate expedition from the United States also visited the site). The initial portion of work included nearly a full week setting up the seismometers and optimizing their operation and, with that complete, two full weeks of continuous operation was then completed with twenty six seismometers covering an area over 1500 square kilometers. The final stage concluded with seven weeks (through the end of February 1989) of continued monitoring with a reduced capacity of twenty units.|$|E
5|$|The fall of Great Moravia made {{room for}} the {{expansion}} of the Czech or Bohemian state, which likewise incorporated some of the Polish lands. The founder of the Přemyslid dynasty, Prince Bořivoj, was baptized by Methodius in the Slavic rite during the later part of the 9th century and settled in Prague. His son and successor Spytihněv was baptized in Regensburg in the Latin rite, which marks the <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> East Frankish/German influence in Bohemian affairs, which was destined to be decisive. Borivoj's grandson Prince Wenceslaus, the future Czech martyr and patron saint, was killed, probably in 935, by his brother Boleslaus. Boleslaus I solidified the power of the Prague princes and most likely dominated the Vistulan and Lendian tribes of Lesser Poland and at least parts of Silesia.|$|E

5|$|The federal government, which {{owned and}} {{operated}} Dulles Airport before Congress created the MWAA, built the Dulles Access Road in the 1960s to connect the airport to Washington by way of Interstate 66. As the access road was built, the government opted to reserve the median of the road for some form of rail transit, and the nearby West Falls Church station was designed so that the line could eventually be extended in this direction. The original 1968 Metrorail plan included an eventual extension to Dulles airport. In 1969, Senator William Spong of Virginia tried unsuccessfully to have the extension to Dulles be built {{as part of an}} <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the system rather than having it be built at some unspecified time in the future. A 1971 study of the feasibility of Metrorail running to Dulles estimated that 30,000 people would ride the extension each day.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Kenny Dykstra and Ric Flair continued. As {{a reward}} for {{defeating}} Flair at New Year's Revolution, Coachman booked Dykstra in a match with Hardy for his WWE Intercontinental Championship. Flair interfered and performed a low blow to Dykstra, allowing Hardy to win. On the following Raw, Flair defeated Dykstra in a rematch, ending their rivalry. The feuds between Carlito and Chris Masters, and Mickie James and Victoria also ended after Carlito and James won subsequent rematches, {{and they began to}} feud with Ric Flair and Melina respectively. The match between Donald Trump and Rosie O'Donnell was actually a parody match, with talent from WWE's developmental territories portraying the characters. This was the <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> a major feud between Donald Trump and Vince McMahon, which would go on to WrestleMania.|$|E
5|$|The {{roots of}} Tephrosia apollinea are deep, {{penetrating}} soils {{to a depth}} of 3 metres or more, aiding the absorption of moisture from the soil. Moisture is stored in the cortex of the roots, which is protected by a thin periderm. Water storage in the cortex enables growth and reproduction during times of drought, which allow it to thrive in both arid and semi-arid conditions and to survive during winter and summer months at times of low rainfall. The roots grow at a faster rate than the shoots themselves, and even at the <b>early</b> <b>stage</b> <b>of</b> the plant displaying a shoot the length of a cm, the roots may already be 30cm or more in length.|$|E
