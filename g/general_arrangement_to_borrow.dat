40|$|This paper {{describes}} the origin, evolution, and results of two initiatives {{taken by the}} United Kingdom in the early 1960 s. Both initiatives aimed at facilitating large-scale lending by the IMF (or in close parallel to the IMF), primarily {{in support of the}} two reserve currencies of the international monetary system, the US dollar and sterling. The first initiativeâ€”of which {{there appears to be no}} previous record extant anywhereâ€”achieved its objective, leading to three important changes in IMF policy, including the <b>General</b> <b>Arrangements</b> <b>to</b> <b>Borrow</b> (GAB). The design of the second practically ensured its failure to win international support; but it provoked the United States into proposing a powerful study group on international liquidity which, seven years later, resulted in the creation of the Special Drawing Right (SDR) facility in the IMF. ...|$|R

Specifically, {{a proposal for}} calls under the GAB may only be made when a proposal {{for the establishment of}} an activation period under the New <b>Arrangements</b> <b>to</b> <b>Borrow</b> (NAB) is not accepted by NAB participants, who number 38 countries, amongst which are the BRICS nations and Middle Eastern powers.|$|R
5000|$|In 2011 and 2012, ALG {{opposed the}} use of U.S. funds at the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to bail out Greece, Ireland and Portugal, which {{were caught in the}} European {{sovereign}} debt crisis, [...] and urged Congress to roll back the 2009 expansion of the IMF including the $100 billion New <b>Arrangements</b> <b>to</b> <b>Borrow,</b> supporting legislation offered by U.S. Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers (R-WA). In 2016, ALG opposed another $56.7 billion expansion of the IMF that was included in the fiscal year 2016 omnibus spending bill.|$|R
50|$|However, {{according}} to the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, the Philippines became a creditor nation in 2010 when it joined the International Monetary Fund (IMF) Financial Transactions Plan (FTP) through which emerging market economies took part in international cooperation efforts to lessen {{the impact of the}} euro debt crisis {{on the rest of the}} global economy. Among the gains the Philippines got from joining the FTP was access <b>to</b> the New <b>Arrangements</b> <b>to</b> <b>Borrow</b> (NAB) facility, which the IMF established to help its members cope with serious international financial crises.|$|R
5000|$|Short sellers <b>borrow,</b> or make <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow,</b> {{the stock}} of a company, which they then sell at current prices. If prices later drop, they {{repurchase}} shares of the company, now at a cheaper price, <b>to</b> replace the <b>borrowed</b> stock. The difference is the profit of the short seller. Heinze's plan was to move aggressively to purchase {{the stock of}} United Copper. The price would soar high. Then, with prices high, and Heinze controlling most of the stock, he would force the short-sellers <b>to</b> repay the <b>borrowed</b> stock, a move called a [...] "short squeeze." [...] The short-sellers would have {{no option but to}} settle with Heinze for high prices.|$|R
50|$|The Gotha G.X was an {{experimental}} bomber with a <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> similar <b>to</b> the Gotha G.V. This relatively small aircraft was powered by two 180 hp B.M.W. IIIa engines and had two-bay wings with auxiliary struts outboard {{of the engine}} nacelles.|$|R
50|$|Based on the 300-series Olympus, the BS.100 {{was similar}} in <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> <b>to</b> {{that of the}} company's Pegasus design, but with the {{addition}} of plenum chamber burning (PCB), to enable the projected Hawker Siddeley P.1154 VSTOL fighter design to accelerate to supersonic speed. PCB is akin to reheat, but is only applied to the bypass stream (i.e. the front nozzles), as the flow turns from fan exit to the nozzle bearing plane. Variable area front nozzles were required, to maintain consistent fan matching regardless of whether the PCB was alight.|$|R

60|$|Siege of Freyburg being completed, and the River {{and most}} other things (except always the bastions, which we blow up) being let into their old {{channels}} there, Marechal de Belleisle, who {{is to have a}} chief management henceforth,--the Most Christian King recognizing him again as his ablest man in war or peace,--sets forth on a long tour of supervision, of diplomacy and <b>general</b> <b>arrangement,</b> <b>to</b> prepare matters for the next Campaign. Need enough of a Belleisle: what a business we have made of it, since Friedrich trod on the serpent's tail for us.! Nothing but our own Freyburg to show for ourselves; elsewhere, mere down-rush of everything whitherward it liked;--and King Friedrich got into such a humor! Friedrich must be put in tune again; something real and good to be agreed on at Berlin: let that be the last thing, crown of the whole. The first thing is, look into Bavaria a little; and how the Kaiser, poor gentleman, in want of all requisites but good-will, can be put into something of fighting posture.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We study {{arrangements}} of pseudohyperplanes (hyperplanes that are topologically deformed in some mild way). In <b>general</b> these <b>arrangements</b> correspond <b>to</b> non-realizable oriented matroids and arise {{as a consequence}} of the Folkman-Lawrence Topological Repre-sentation Theorem. We introduce a topological space naturally associated with these pseudo arrangements that has the homotopy type of the associated Salvetti complex...|$|R
40|$|The {{important}} {{success of}} the mobile systems of telecommunication motivates the suppliers of service to be reflected about enormous means of investments for infrastructures of network. The conception of big cellular networks is a complex problem, which turns around a big impact: {{the quality of the}} service and the cost of the network. With the continuous and fast growth of the traffic of communication, the large-scale planning becomes more and more difficult. This need is now more pointed with the evolution of phone networks (GSM), because of the biggest complexity of the system and the number of parameters which must be considered. In this subject, the solutions of the problems of dynamic optimization, Multicriteria associating the financial criteria (cost of the network), the technical criteria (insurance, availability) are developed in a context and the criteria of sale (quality of service). The interest of metaheuristiques (methods of optimization) is based on their capacity to find the effective solutions in a reasonable time. But with objective multi-problems, the efficiency of metaheuristiques can be compromised. Consequently, in this context it is necessary to integrate these methods into more <b>general</b> <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> develop more effective methods. For such reasons we are going to present an approach based on the multi-systems agents and the spatial ontologies, to conceive methods adaptive automobile which can react to the shape of the problem...|$|R
50|$|The former Brisbane Customs House is {{important}} in demonstrating the principal characteristics of its class of cultural places: late 19th century masonry customs houses.

5000|$|With the {{incorporated}} changes, {{the model}} was transported over specially installed rails to the Palais de l'Industrie for public display at the 1863 exhibition. Théophile Gautier wrote of the model (Le Moniteur Universel, 13 May 1863) that [...] "the <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> becomes intelligible <b>to</b> all eyes and already acquires a sort of reality that better permits one to prejudge the final effect ... it attracts the crowd's curiosity; it is, in effect, the new Opéra seen through reversed opera glasses." [...] The model is now lost, but it was photographed by J. B. Donas in 1863.|$|R
40|$|Preliminary layouts {{were made}} for the exhaust system, air {{induction}} system, and battery installation. Points of interference were identified and resolved by altering either the vehicle or engine designs. An engine <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> evolved <b>to</b> meet the vehicle engine compartment constraints while minimizing the duct pressure losses and the heat rejection. A power transfer system (between gasifier and power turbines) was developed to maintain nearly constant temperatures throughout {{the entire range of}} engine operation. An advanced four speed automatic transmission was selected to be used with the engine. Performance calculations show improvements in component efficiencies and an increase in fuel economy. A single stage centrifugal compressor design was completed and released for procurement. Gasifier turbine, power turbine, combustor, generator, secondary systems, materials, controls, and transmission development are reported...|$|R
5000|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to raise funds for}} large capital works projects, e.g. {{drilling}} for gas on the north-west shelf between Australia and Timor and constructing a pipeline for transporting the gas down to Eastern Australia, senior ministers Rex Connor and Lionel Murphy, along with Prime Minister Gough Whitlam made <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> approximately US$4,000 million petrodollars from the Middle East through an intermediary, a Pakistani banker called Tirath Khemlani (the so-called [...] "Loans Affair"). Cairns first became aware of what was to become known as the Loans Affair three days after being appointed Treasurer, on 13 December 1974, when he entered {{at the end of a}} meeting of the Labor Party federal executive at the Lodge, Whitlam explained the situation and requested that Cairns co-sign approval for the loan. Cairns did so, noting to Whitlam that the state premiers should be informed of the loan (this did not occur). Subsequently, Sir Frederick Wheeler, Secretary of the Treasury (the head of Cairns' department) and other members of staff communicated to Cairns that Khemlani was of questionable character. In his capacity as Acting Prime Minister during Gough Whitlam's overseas trip covering late 1974 to early 1975, Cairns arranged a meeting at the Reserve Bank in Canberra attended by various senior officials, including Lionel Murphy and Rex Connor. After some debate, the outcome of this meeting was that Connor's authority <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> the loan in question was cancelled. Whitlam returned from overseas on 19 January 1975 and on 27 January 1975, Connor's authority <b>to</b> <b>borrow</b> the loan was reinstated without consultation with Cairns as Treasurer, who found out after the fact. A short time later, when Cairns was about to visit the United States in an official capacity, his staff informed him that if the issue of the Khemlani loan were not dealt with, it would most likely overshadow his visit. This, plus Cairns' pre-existing reservations about the loan, prompted him to discuss the issue once again with Whitlam, who then agreed that Connor's dealings with Khemlani should come to an end. Whitlam requested that Cairns be the one to deliver the news to Connor and Cairns did so. Rex Connor was later dismissed by Whitlam for continuing his unauthorised business communications with Khemlani. Whitlam moved Cairns from Treasury to the Environment ministry.|$|R
60|$|The mob {{had been}} divided from its first {{assemblage}} into four divisions; the London, the Westminster, the Southwark, and the Scotch. Each of these divisions being subdivided into various bodies, and these bodies being drawn up {{in various forms}} and figures, the <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> was, except <b>to</b> the few chiefs and leaders, as unintelligible as the plan of a great battle to the meanest soldier in the field. It was not without its method, however; for, {{in a very short}} space of time after being put in motion, the crowd had resolved itself into three great parties, and were prepared, as had been arranged, to cross the river by different bridges, and make for the House of Commons in separate detachments.|$|R
50|$|Those chapels {{which may}} be entered from the aisles of the nave are also 6.7 m wide, and roofed with simple barrel vaulting. The chapel of Saints Gregory and Augustine, next the baptistery, from which it is {{separated}} by an open screen of marble, {{was the first to}} have its decoration completed. The marble lining of the piers rises to the springing level of the vaulting and this level has determined the height of the altar reredos, and of the screen opposite. On the side wall, under the windows, the marble dado rises to but little more than half this height. From the cornices the mosaic decoration begins on the walls and vault. This <b>general</b> <b>arrangement</b> applies <b>to</b> all the chapels yet each has its own distinct artistic character. Thus, {{in sharp contrast to the}} chapel dedicated to St. Gregory and St. Augustine which contains vibrant mosaics, the chapel of the Holy Souls employs a more subdued, almost funereal style, decoration with late Victorian on a background of silver.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{responds}} to the recent backlash against AIDS-specific funding by setting out the key claims and examining the evidence to determine which criticisms are justified, and which are not. The backlash against international funding for AIDS has taken a number of forms, with some suggesting that {{the extent of the}} problem (the HIV epidemic) has been exaggerated and others arguing that UNAIDS programme efforts have been misdirected. A key claim however, is that AIDS-related funding has undermined health systems in developing countries. A primary contributor to the backlash has been Roger England, who asserts that the international AIDS response has produced “the biggest vertical programme in history” and that this funding “could be more effective if used to strengthen public health” (England, 2007 : 344). The reasoning behind this argument has been that the sheer scale of international funding for AIDS has not only been unwarranted, but that it has damaged health systems in developing countries by diverting resources from other areas of the health sector (see argument summarised in Nattrass and Gonsalves (2009 : 1)). Ultimately the recommendation is that AIDS-specific funding must be curtailed and the resources instead channelled through sector-wide <b>general</b> budget <b>arrangements</b> <b>to</b> support health systems more generally and to allow domestic priorities to direct spending decisions...|$|R

The basis for this claim was interviews that he conducted with Theodosia Prevost, the widow of Jacques Marcus Prevost who later married Burr, and notes later made by Burr. While en route to Philadelphia from West Point in 1780, Peggy Shippen Arnold visited with Prevost at Paramus, New Jersey. According to Parton, she unburdened herself to Prevost, claiming that she [...] "was heartily tired of all the theatricals she was exhibiting", referring to her histrionics at West Point. According to Burr's notes, Shippen Arnold [...] "was disgusted with the American cause" [...] and [...] "through unceasing perseverance, she had ultimately brought the <b>general</b> into an <b>arrangement</b> <b>to</b> surrender West Point." ...|$|R
