5|$|In 1902, facing {{cash flow}} problems, John Cleveland Osgood turned to George Jay Gould, a {{principal}} stockholder of the Denver and Rio Grande, for a loan. Gould, via Frederick Taylor Gates, Rockefeller's financial adviser, brought <b>John</b> <b>D.</b> <b>Rockefeller</b> {{in to help}} finance the loan. Analysis of the company's operations by <b>John</b> <b>D.</b> <b>Rockefeller,</b> Jr. showed a need for substantially more funds which were provided in exchange for acquisition of CF's subsidiaries such as the Colorado and Wyoming Railway Company, the Crystal River Railroad Company, and possibly the Rocky Mountain Coal and Iron Company. Control was passed from the Iowa Group to Gould and Rockefeller interests in 1903 with Gould in control and Rockefeller and Gates representing a minority interests. Osgood left the company in 1904 and devoted his efforts to operating competing coal and coke operations.|$|E

The strong police response to the Tarrytown protests led to a bomb plot by several Ferrer Center anarchists.|$|E

5|$|In 1859, Edwin Drake of Pennsylvania {{invented a}} {{drilling}} process to extract oil {{from deep within}} the earth. Drake's invention is credited with giving birth to the oil industry in the U.S. The first oil refiner in the United States opened in 1861 in Western Pennsylvania, during the Pennsylvanian oil rush. Standard Oil, which had been founded by <b>John</b> <b>D.</b> <b>Rockefeller</b> in Ohio, became a multi-state trust and came to dominate the young petroleum industry in the U.S.|$|E

5|$|The present château, {{designed}} on {{a triangular}} plan, has five conical towers and a watchtower capped by slate roofs. Archaeologists have uncovered {{traces of the}} older buildings on the site {{dating back to the}} 11th century. The architect Frantz Jourdain renovated the interior of the 14th century tower as a library for the Rochefoucault family in 1893. The Hunt of the Unicorn tapestries of the building, which hung in the master bedroom, were rediscovered in 1850; they were later sold to <b>John</b> <b>D.</b> <b>Rockefeller,</b> Jr. in 1923.|$|E
5|$|By {{the first}} decade of the 20th century, a number of {{business}} entities had formed themselves into trusts, which dominated their industries. Trusts often sought to purchase or otherwise neutralize their competitors, allowing the conglomerates to raise prices to high levels. In 1890, Congress had passed the Sherman Anti-Trust Act, but it was not until the Theodore Roosevelt administration (1901–09) that serious efforts were made to break up or control the trusts. The dominant force in the oil industry was Standard Oil, controlled by <b>John</b> <b>D.</b> <b>Rockefeller.</b> Modern-day Exxon, Mobil, Atlantic Richfield, Chevron, Sohio, Amoco and Continental Oil all trace their ancestry to various parts of Standard Oil.|$|E
5|$|Efforts to {{preserve}} {{the region as a}} national park began in the late 19thcentury, and in 1929 Grand Teton National Park was established, protecting the Teton Range's major peaks. The valley of Jackson Hole remained in private ownership until the 1930s, when conservationists led by <b>John</b> <b>D.</b> <b>Rockefeller,</b> Jr. began purchasing land in Jackson Hole {{to be added to the}} existing national park. Against public opinion and with repeated Congressional efforts to repeal the measures, much of Jackson Hole was set aside for protection as Jackson Hole National Monument in 1943. The monument was abolished in 1950 and most of the monument land was added to Grand Teton National Park.|$|E

5|$|Grand Teton National Park {{has five}} front-country {{vehicular}} access campgrounds. The largest are the Colter Bay and Gros Ventre campgrounds, {{and each has}} 350campsites which can accommodate large recreational vehicles. Lizard Creek and Signal Mountain campgrounds have 60 and 86campsites respectively, while the smaller Jenny Lake campground has only 49 sites for tent use only. Additionally, full hookups for recreational vehicles are at the concessionaire managed 112campsites at Colter Bay Village and another 100 at Flagg Ranch in the <b>John</b> <b>D.</b> <b>Rockefeller</b> Memorial Parkway. Though all front-country campgrounds are only open from late spring to late fall, primitive winter camping is permitted at Colter Bay near the visitor center.|$|E
5|$|BioShock is a first-person shooter {{video game}} {{developed}} by 2K Boston (later Irrational Games) and 2K Australia, {{and published by}} 2K Games. The game was released for Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 platforms in August 2007; a PlayStation 3 port by Irrational, 2K Marin, 2K Australia and Digital Extremes was released in October 2008, and an OS X port by Feral Interactive in October 2009. A mobile version was developed by IG Fun. The game's concept was developed by Irrational's creative lead, Ken Levine, and incorporates ideas by 20th century dystopian and utopian thinkers such as Ayn Rand, George Orwell, and Aldous Huxley, as well as historical figures such as <b>John</b> <b>D.</b> <b>Rockefeller.</b> The game is considered a spiritual successor to the System Shock series, on which many of Irrational's team including Levine had worked previously.|$|E
5|$|In August 1906, a {{group of}} Cleveland Baptists {{incorporated}} an organization, the Baptist Home of Northern Ohio, to establish a retirement home for elderly Baptists. Ten months later, Southworth sold his house to the organization, which was supported financially by industrialist and philanthropist <b>John</b> <b>D.</b> <b>Rockefeller,</b> who was a Baptist. With the aid of local churches, the home was opened on October 16, 1907. According to the 1910 census, the Baptist Home served fourteen residents {{at the end of}} 1910, at which time the entire property was worth $15,000. The former Southworth residence was not long a retirement home: the Baptist Home moved to a new location in 1919 and sold the Southworth House in the same year.

5|$|In December 1979, the Marquesa Margaret Rockefeller de Larrain, {{granddaughter of}} <b>John</b> <b>D.</b> <b>Rockefeller,</b> gave the Villa Le Balze to Georgetown University.

The main facility for the McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies was donated to Georgetown in 1989 by alumnus and former United States Ambassador to Turkey George C. McGhee.

5|$|Lathrop House was {{the third}} {{residential}} quadrangle (quad) dormitory built {{on the campus of}} Vassar College in the town of Poughkeepsie, New York. The college built Lathrop during a period of rapid dorm construction spanning 1893–1902 during which the older seminary-style model of housing—a single large hall in which all a college's residents lived, in Vassar's case Main Building—was quickly waning in popularity in favor of smaller individual houses. The project began with the opening of Strong House in 1893 and continued with Raymond House in 1897; Lathrop followed in 1901, and Davison House's erection completed the quad in 1902. Construction of the dorm was paid for with Vassar's funds, unlike Strong House which had been paid for by a gift from <b>John</b> <b>D.</b> <b>Rockefeller.</b>|$|E
5|$|New {{economic}} forces also changed the Commonwealth. Virginian James Albert Bonsack invented the tobacco cigarette rolling machine in 1880 leading to new {{industrial scale production}} centered on Richmond. In 1886, railroad magnate Collis Potter Huntington founded Newport News Shipbuilding, which was responsible for building six major World War I-era battleships for the U.S. Navy from 1907 to 1923. During the war, German submarines like U-151 attacked ships outside the port. In 1926, Dr. W.A.R. Goodwin, rector of Williamsburg's Bruton Parish Church, began restoration of colonial-era buildings in the historic district with financial backing of <b>John</b> <b>D.</b> <b>Rockefeller,</b> Jr. Though their project, like others in the state, {{had to contend with}} the Great Depression and World War II, work continued as Colonial Williamsburg became a major tourist attraction.|$|E
