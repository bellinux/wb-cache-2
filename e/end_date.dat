40|$|Preliminary! Abstract: This paper {{investigates the}} {{measurement}} error in <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> of fur-ther training {{programs in the}} German Integrated Employment Biographies Sample (IEBS) to gain insights on how measurement error in <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> of treatments affects evaluation results and {{on how to deal}} with this problem in future studies using the IEBS. Error-proneness of <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> in the IEBS is discussed, correction procedures are introduced and their influence on estimated employment effects is analysed us-ing simple descriptive analysis, propensity score matching and a descriptive duration model. Though there is considerable measurement error in the <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> that can be corrected, the effect on evaluation results is modest, because for evaluation <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> are relevant only through indirect channels. The impact on causal effects based on matching is highest during the lock-in period and for long programs...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: With {{administrative}} data becoming increasingly important for empirical research, {{the quality of}} crucial variables of process generated data is of growing interest. This paper investigates reported <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> of further training programs in the German Integrated Employment Biographies Sample (IEBS) to gain insights {{on how to deal}} with this sensitive part of the IEBS in future studies and on how measurement error in program <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> affects evaluation results.

Error-proneness of <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> in the IEBS is discussed, correction procedures are introduced and their influence on estimated employment effects is analyzed using basic descriptive analysis, propensity score snatching and a descriptive duration model. Though there is considerable measurement error in the <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> that can be corrected, the effect on evaluation results is modest, because for evaluation <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> are relevant only through indirect channels. The impact on causal effects based on matching is highest during the lock-in period and for long programs. The advice for future users of the IEBS is to decide depending on their evaluation design and goal if an explicit correction of <b>end</b> <b>dates</b> is necessary. In case an explicit correction is dispensable, it seems still important to take care that program spells are not given priority to employment spells in case of conflict.

5|$|The Atlantic {{hurricane}} season officially began on June1, though the first tropical depression did not develop until July17. During the season, 15tropical depressions formed. Eight of the depressions attained tropical storm status, and eight of these attained hurricane status. Two of the hurricanes further strengthened to become major hurricanes. Only Allen made landfall at hurricane strength during the season, although Hurricane Charley and tropical storms Danielle and Hermine also caused damage and fatalities. Those three cyclones collectively caused 337deaths and $1.5billion (1980USD) in damage. The last storm of the season, Hurricane Karl, dissipated on November27, {{only three days}} before the official <b>end</b> <b>date</b> of November30.|$|E

5|$|The {{period of}} Daylight Saving Time before the longest day is {{shorter than the}} period after, in several {{countries}} including the United States and Europe. This unequal split is an energy saving measure. For example, in the U.S. the period of Daylight Saving Time {{is defined by the}} Energy Policy Act of 2005. The period for Daylight Saving Time was extended by changing the start date from the first Sunday of April to the second Sunday of March, and the <b>end</b> <b>date</b> from the last Sunday in October to the first Sunday in November.|$|E
5|$|Though the {{official}} {{end of the}} Atlantic hurricane season occurs on November30, the dates of October31 and November15 have also historically marked {{the official}} <b>end</b> <b>date</b> for the hurricane season. December, the only {{month of the year}} after the hurricane season, has featured the cyclogenesis of fourteen tropical cyclones. Tropical Storm Zeta in 2005 was the latest tropical cyclone to attain tropical storm intensity as it did so on December30. However, the second Hurricane Alice in 1954 was the latest forming tropical cyclone to attain hurricane intensity. Both Zeta and Alice were the only two storms to exist in two calendar years– the former from 1954 to 1955 and the latter from 2005 to 2006. No storms have been recorded to exceed Category1 hurricane intensity in December. In 1999, Hurricane Lenny reached Category4 intensity on November17 as it took an unprecedented west to east track across the Caribbean; its intensity made it the latest developing Category4 hurricane, though this was well within the bounds of the hurricane season. Hurricane Hattie (October 27-November 1, 1961) was initially thought to have been the latest forming Category5 hurricane ever documented, though reanalysis indicated that a devastating hurricane in 1932 reached such an intensity at a later date. Consequently, this made the hurricane the latest developing tropical cyclone to reach all four Saffir–Simpson hurricane wind scale classifications past Category1 intensity.|$|E
25|$|McKenna {{suspected}} that notable events in history {{could be identified}} that would help him locate the time wave's <b>end</b> <b>date</b> and attempted to find the best-fit placement when matching the graph to the data field of human history.
