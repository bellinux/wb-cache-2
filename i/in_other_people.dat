25|$|Sheldon is {{a senior}} {{theoretical}} physicist at Caltech and shared an apartment with his colleague and best friend, Leonard Hofstadter (Johnny Galecki). However, Sheldon now lives across the hall with his fiancée Amy, in the former apartment of Leonard's wife Penny. He is a former child prodigy with genius level IQ, but displays an almost total lack of social skills, a tenuous understanding of humor, and difficulty recognizing irony and sarcasm <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> although he himself often employs them. He exhibits highly idiosyncratic behavior and {{a general lack of}} humility or empathy. He also lacks toleration. These characteristics provide the majority of the humor involving him, which has caused him to be described as the show's breakout character. Despite speculation that Sheldon's personality traits may be consistent with Asperger syndrome, obsessive–compulsive personality disorder, and asexuality, co-creator Bill Prady has repeatedly stated that Sheldon's character was neither conceived nor developed with regard to any of these traits.|$|E
500|$|Shortly after Hands {{over the}} City, Steiger agreed {{to appear in}} another Italian film, Time of Indifference (1964), in which he starred {{opposite}} Claudia Cardinale and Shelley Winters. Though Steiger's powerful performance was unaffected, the production was marred by a dispute between director Francesco Maselli and producer Franco Cristaldi, with one wanting {{it to be a}} purely political film and the other wanting emphasis on the erotic subplot and his relationship with Cardinale. In Sidney Lumet's gritty drama The Pawnbroker (1964), Steiger played an embittered, emotionally withdrawn survivor of the Holocaust living in New York City. Richard Harland Smith of TCM notes that Steiger's career was waning at the time, and he had to [...] "scramble for paying gigs for a decade" [...] before getting this part. Steiger agreed to a reduced fee of $50,000. [...] He read Lumet's novel and the script many times to develop an intimate understanding of the character, and insisted on reducing his lines to make his character more realistic and alienated from society. Lumet noted that during the production Steiger had a tendency to be overly dramatic, stating: [...] "Sure, Rod has weaknesses of rhetoric, but you can talk them through with him. I explained that this solitary Jew could not rise to heights of emotion; he had been hammered by life and by people. The faith he had to find was <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>people,</b> because God had betrayed him." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kent's early {{notes on}} Genie {{contained}} little linguistic information, which linguists wrote demonstrated Genie's unresponsiveness to language. Kent observed that she seemed interested <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> talking and attentively {{looked at the}} mouth of a speaker but had almost no reaction to speech. She seemed to recognize only a very few words which she always reacted to as if she heard them in isolation, and was entirely unable to respond to very basic sentences or commands without non-linguistic information. Hospital staff initially thought she understood them based on her few responses, but later determined she was reacting to accompanying nonverbal signals. She almost never tried to speak, and Kent described these efforts as, [...] "a kind of throaty whimper." [...] Because she had been forced to repress all vocalization during infancy and childhood her larynx and vocal tract were extremely underused and the muscles used for speech production were severely atrophied, which doctors believed made it difficult for her to control both air flow and her vocal chords.|$|E
2500|$|In his {{exposition}} of the felicific calculus, Bentham proposed a classification of 12 pains and 14 pleasures, {{by which we}} might test the [...] "happiness factor" [...] of any action. Nonetheless, {{it should not be}} overlooked that Bentham's [...] "hedonistic" [...] theory (a term from J.J.C. Smart), unlike Mill's, is often criticized for lacking a principle of fairness embodied in a conception of justice. In Bentham and the Common Law Tradition, Gerald J. Postema states: [...] "No moral concept suffers more at Bentham's hand than the concept of justice. There is no sustained, mature analysis of the notion..." [...] Thus, some critics object, it would be acceptable to torture one person if this would produce an amount of happiness <b>in</b> <b>other</b> <b>people</b> outweighing the unhappiness of the tortured individual. However, as P. J. Kelly argued in Utilitarianism and Distributive Justice: Jeremy Bentham and the Civil Law, Bentham had a theory of justice that prevented such consequences. According to Kelly, for Bentham the law [...] "provides the basic framework of social interaction by delimiting spheres of personal inviolability within which individuals can form and pursue their own conceptions of well-being". It provides security, a precondition for the formation of expectations. As the hedonic calculus shows [...] "expectation utilities" [...] to be much higher than natural ones, it follows that Bentham does not favour the sacrifice of a few to the benefit of the many.|$|E

At the time of Asher's announcement, McCartney was at his father's home with Schwartz by his side. McCartney, {{who had not been}} formally broken up with before the announcement, had been publicly dumped on television. Though Schwartz has confirmed that Asher did see them in bed together, she claims that she was not the sole reason for the breakup, and that the couple {{were on the verge of}} breaking up prior to Asher walking <b>in.</b> <b>Other</b> <b>people,</b> such as Hunter Davies and Barry Miles, state that the relationship always had major problems, one of those being that McCartney wanted Asher to give up her career after they married, an aspiration of his that Asher would not comply with. Another prevalent problem in the relationship was McCartney's drug use and womanizing. After returning to London from a five-month acting tour of the United States in May 1967, Asher found McCartney to be completely different, confiding in Davies that McCartney had [...] "changed so much.
