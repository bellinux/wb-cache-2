5|$|On 7 November, {{engineers}} <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> {{there was}} no additional work needed to verify the solid rocket boosters for flight, following discovery of small cracks in the hold-down posts attached to boosters that had flown earlier that year.

5|$|Berzelius {{made some}} initial characterisations {{of the new}} metal and its {{chemical}} compounds: he correctly <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the thorium–oxygen mass ratio of thorium oxide was 7.5 (its actual value is close to that, ~7.3), but he assumed the new element was divalent rather than tetravalent, and so calculated that the atomic mass was 7.5 times that of oxygen (120 amu); it is actually 15 times as large. He <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> thorium was a very electropositive metal, ahead of cerium and behind zirconium in electropositivity. Metallic thorium was isolated {{for the first time}} in 1914 by Dutch entrepreneurs Dirk Lely Jr. and Lodewijk Hamburger.|$|E

5|$|Citing Hirabayashi, Chief Justice Stone {{wrote the}} opinion of the court, and <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the curfew and {{exclusion}} orders were valid, even as applied to citizens of the United States. Stone’s opinion was three pages and did not contain any concurring opinions or dissents, while the Hirabayashi decision had thirty-four pages and two concurring opinions. In Yasui the court affirmed his conviction of the misdemeanor, but ordered re-sentencing since the lower court had <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the curfew was not valid, and that Yasui had forfeited his citizenship. The Supreme Court remanded (returned) the case back to the district court to determine a sentence in light of these circumstances.|$|E

5|$|In 1828, Morten Thrane Esmark found a black mineral on Løvøya island, Telemark county, Norway. He was a Norwegian {{priest and}} amateur {{mineralogist}} {{who studied the}} minerals in Telemark, where he served as vicar. He commonly sent the most interesting specimens, such as this one, to his father, Jens Esmark, a noted mineralogist and professor of mineralogy and geology at the University of Oslo. The elder Esmark <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> {{it was not a}} known mineral and sent a sample to Berzelius for examination. Berzelius <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> it contained a new element. He published his findings in 1829, having isolated an impure sample by reducing KThF5 with potassium metal. Berzelius reused the name of the previous supposed element discovery and named the source mineral thorite.|$|E
5|$|In 1915, Walter Sydney Adams, using a 60-inch (1.5m) {{reflector}} at Mount Wilson Observatory, {{observed the}} spectrum of Sirius B and <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> it was a faint whitish star. This led astronomers to conclude {{that it was a}} white dwarf, the second to be discovered. The diameter of Sirius A was first measured by Robert Hanbury Brown and Richard Q. Twiss in 1959 at Jodrell Bank using their stellar intensity interferometer. In 2005, using the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> Sirius B has nearly the diameter of the Earth, , with a mass 102% of the Sun's.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, it was <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> the {{rhesus monkey}} kidney cells used {{to prepare the}} {{poliovirus}} vaccines were infected with the SV40 virus (Simian Virus-40). SV40 was also discovered in 1960 and is a naturally occurring virus that infects monkeys. In 1961, SV40 was found to cause tumors in rodents. More recently, the virus was found in certain forms of cancer in humans, for instance brain and bone tumors, pleural and peritoneal mesothelioma, and some types of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. However, {{it has not been}} <b>determined</b> <b>that</b> SV40 causes these cancers.|$|E
