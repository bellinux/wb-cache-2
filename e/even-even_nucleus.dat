5000|$|Beta {{decay of}} an <b>even-even</b> <b>nucleus</b> {{produces}} an odd-odd nucleus, and vice versa. An even number of protons or of neutrons are more stable (higher binding energy) because of pairing effects, so even-even nuclei {{are much more}} stable than odd-odd. One effect {{is that there are}} few stable odd-odd nuclides, but another effect is to prevent beta decay of many even-even nuclei into another <b>even-even</b> <b>nucleus</b> of the same mass number but lower energy, because decay proceeding {{one step at a time}} would have to pass through an odd-odd nucleus of higher energy. Double beta decay directly from even-even to even-even skipping over an odd-odd nuclide is only occasionally possible, and even then with a half-life greater than a billion times the age of the universe. For example, the double beta emitter [...] has a half-life of [...] years. This makes for a larger number of stable even-even nuclides, up to three for some mass numbers, and up to seven for some atomic (proton) numbers.|$|E

40|$|The {{properties}} of medium and heavy mass odd-even nuclei {{have been studied}} {{in the framework of}} the interacting boson-fermion model. This model introduces several new aspects in the description of odd-A nuclei. First the structure of the interaction between the odd nucleon and the <b>even-even</b> core <b>nucleus</b> can be derived using a semi-microscopic theory. Second, in addition to providing a unified framework for the description of odd-even nuclei the group structure of the IBFM hamiltonian makes it possible to construct dynamical (boson-fermion) symmetries in a mixed system of boson (collective) and fermion (single-particle) degrees of freedom. Third, the almost equal values of the parameters extracted form a fit to the excitation spectrum of an odd-even nucleus in a dynamical boson-fermion symmetry and those extracted from fits to the adjacent <b>even-even</b> <b>nuclei</b> suggest the presence of even larger class of symmetries, in which both the odd-even and the <b>even-even</b> <b>nuclei</b> belong to the same multiplet.
