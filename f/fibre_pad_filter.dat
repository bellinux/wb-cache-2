40|$|<b>Filter</b> <b>pad</b> light {{absorption}} measurements {{are subject to}} two major sources of experimental uncertainty: the so-called pathlength amplification factor, β, and scattering offsets, o, for which previous null-correction approaches are limited by recent observations of non-zero absorption in the near infrared (NIR). A new <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> absorption correction method is presented here which uses linear regression against point-source integrating cavity absorption meter (PSICAM) absorption data to simultaneously resolve both β and the scattering offset. The PSICAM has previously been shown to provide accurate absorption data, even in highly scattering waters. Comparisons of PSICAM and <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> particulate absorption data reveal linear relationships that vary on a sample by sample basis. This regression approach provides significantly improved agreement with PSICAM data (3. 2 % RMS%E) than previously published <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> absorption corrections. Results show that direct transmittance (T-method) <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> absorption measurements perform effectively {{at the same level}} as more complex geometrical configurations based on integrating cavity measurements (IS-method and QFT-ICAM) because the linear regression correction compensates for the sensitivity to scattering errors in the T-method. This approach produces accurate <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> particulate absorption data for wavelengths in the blue/UV and in the NIR where sensitivity issues with PSICAM measurements limit performance. The combination of the <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> absorption and PSICAM is therefore recommended for generating full spectral, best quality particulate absorption data as it enables correction of multiple errors sources across both measurements...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{by others}} and internal investigations at Philip Morris International (PMI) {{have shown that}} the standard trapping and extraction procedure used for conventional cigarettes, defined in the International Standard ISO 4387 (Cigarettes [...] Determination of total and nicotine-free dry particulate matter using a routine analytical smoking machine), is not suitable for high-water content aerosols. Errors occur because of water losses during the opening of the Cambridge <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> holder to remove the <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> as well as during the manual handling of the <b>filter</b> <b>pad,</b> and because the commercially available <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> holder, which is constructed out of plastic, may adsorb water. This results in inaccurate values for the water content, and erroneous and overestimated values for Nicotine Free Dry Particulate Matter (NFDPM). A modified 44 mm Cambridge <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> holder and extraction equipment which supports in situ extraction methodology has been developed and tested. The principle of the in situ extraction methodology is to avoid any of the above mentioned water losses by extracting the loaded <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> while kept in the Cambridge <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> holder which is hermetically sealed by two caps. This is achieved by flushing the extraction solvent numerous times through the hermetically sealed Cambridge <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> holder by means of an in situ extractor. The in situ methodology showed a significantly more complete water recovery, resulting in more accurate NFDPM values for high-water content aerosols compared to the standard ISO methodology. The work presented in this publication demonstrates that the in situ extraction methodology applies to a wider range of smoking products and smoking regimens, whereas the standard ISO methodology only applies to a limited range of smoking products and smoking regimens, e. g., conventional cigarettes smoked under ISO smoking regimen. In cases where a comparison of yields between the PMI HTP and conventional cigarettes is required the in situ extraction methodology must be used for the aerosol of the PMI HTP to obtain accurate NFDPM/”tar” values. This would be for example the case if there were a need to print “tar” yields on packs or compare yields to ceilings. Failure to use the in situ extraction methodology will result in erroneous and overestimated NFDPM/”tar” values...|$|R

5000|$|The {{whale shark}} is a filter feeder - {{one of only}} three known filter-feeding shark species (along with the basking shark and the megamouth shark). It feeds on {{plankton}} including copepods, krill, fish eggs, Christmas Island red crab larvae [...] and small nektonic life, such as small squid or fish. It also feeds on clouds of eggs during mass spawning of fish and corals. The many rows of vestigial teeth play no role in feeding. Feeding occurs either by ram filtration, in which the animal opens its mouth and swims forward, pushing water and food into the mouth, or by active suction feeding, in which the animal opens and closes its mouth, sucking in volumes of water that are then expelled through the gills. In both cases, the <b>filter</b> <b>pads</b> serve to separate food from water. These unique, black sieve-like structures are presumed to be modified gill rakers. Food separation in whale sharks is by cross-flow filtration, in which the water travels nearly parallel to the <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> surface, not perpendicularly through it, before passing to the outside, while denser food particles continue {{to the back of the}} throat. This is an extremely efficient filtration method that minimizes fouling of the <b>filter</b> <b>pad</b> surface.

The proposed method is achieved by mathematical relations using vector processing for image filtering which it is equivalent to the spatial domain zero <b>padding</b> <b>filtering.</b> Also to avoid the zero padding artifacts {{around the edge of the}} block, we prepare preliminary matrices in DCT domain by implementation elements of selected mask which satisfies border replication for a block in the spatial domain.

40|$|The {{influence}} of sulphonic and carboxylic acid groups {{in combination with}} the effect of counter ion form, on the swelling capacity of mechanical pulp fibres was studied by means of water retention value (WRV) measured in the temperature range from 25 to 95 oC. Mechanical pulp fibres (TMP) were treated with hydrogen peroxide and/or sodium sulphite during conditions resembling those used in chemimechanical and bleaching processes commonly used in the industry. In conventional chemimechanical processes sulphite treatment is used before refining while peroxide treatment can be utilized both before and after refining. In this study we did however also use sulphite after peroxide treatment. When subjecting sodium sulphite treated pulps to a subsequent hydrogen peroxide step, all pulps show a decrease in sulphonic acid groups, which could be owed to dissolution of highly charged lignin. Pulps treated with a high hydrogen peroxide charge (4 %), showed a loss in carboxylic acid groups during subsequent treatment with sodium sulphite. This loss is probably due to dissolution of highly charged fibre material such as demethylated pectins. Both increased degree of sulphonation and carboxylation of the lignin reduces the softening temperature by means of reducing the degree of cross-linking in the lignin matrix. This softening probably improves the compressibility of the <b>fibre</b> <b>pads</b> in the sample holders of the WRV centrifuge, which would counteract an otherwise expected increasing WRV-value due to increased swelling potential. This makes it difficult to see clear trends in WRV as a function of increase in degree of sulphonation and carboxylation.

The two phenomena are due to the contribution of the added data points and the conservation of the power energy when the data length is increased, respectively.

40|$|Membranes of enzyme sensors are {{in general}} {{composed}} of three layers. 1 For examples, the oxygen electrode in glucose biosensors {{is covered with}} an oxygen-permeable membrane which protects the electrolyte solution and prevents an interference from nonvolatile electroactive components in the samples. The middle layer contains glucose oxidases in a polymer gel or on a <b>filter</b> <b>pad.</b> The outer layer such as a cellophane dialysis membrane protects the enzymes from the substrate environments. If enzymes can be immobilized at a surface of oxygen-permeable polymer membrane, the biocatalyst support materials may not be necessary. 2, 3 Poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) {{is one of the}} highest gas-permeable polymers among the industrial membrane materials, but exhibits the lowest oxygen/nitroge...|$|R
