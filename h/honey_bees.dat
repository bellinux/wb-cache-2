5|$|Varroa {{destructor}} is a parasitic mite that colonizes beehives and preys on <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> by consuming their hemolymph. Varroa mites parasitize {{all types}} of <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (workers, nurse bees, larvae) depending on their life cycle stage. During the phoretic stage, Varroa prefer to attach to nurse bees as this results in higher fitness leading into the reproductive stage. The mites then feed on larvae during their reproductive stage and increased fitness leads {{to an increase in}} mite fecundity (# of female offspring). Due to Varroas ability to feed on {{all types of}} <b>honey</b> <b>bees,</b> they are one of the biggest threats to colonies, especially over winter.|$|E
5|$|<b>Honey</b> <b>bees</b> are {{affected}} by parasites including acarine and Varroa mites. However, some bees {{are believed to have}} a mutualistic relationship with mites.|$|E
5|$|Some species {{including}} <b>honey</b> <b>bees,</b> bumblebees, and stingless bees live socially in colonies. Bees are {{adapted for}} feeding on nectar and pollen, the former primarily as an energy source {{and the latter}} primarily for protein and other nutrients. Most pollen is used as food for larvae. Bee pollination is important both ecologically and commercially; the decline in wild bees has increased the value of pollination by commercially managed hives of <b>honey</b> <b>bees.</b>|$|E

50|$|The Carniolan <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> (Apis mellifera carnica, Pollmann) is a {{subspecies}} of {{the western}} <b>honey</b> <b>bee.</b> The Carniolan <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> is native to Slovenia, southern Austria, and parts of Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Serbia, Hungary, Romania, and Bulgaria.|$|R
30|$|Tanzania <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> {{has been}} {{reported}} for DPPH radical scacvenging activity with IC 50 4.19, 12.93 and 18.03  mg/mL in stingless <b>bee</b> <b>honeys,</b> raw <b>bees</b> <b>honey</b> and processed <b>bees</b> <b>honey</b> respectively. Similarly, iron chelating activities were reported with IC 50 value of 0.04, 0.057 and 0.158  mg/mL for stingless <b>bee’s</b> <b>honey,</b> raw <b>bee’s</b> <b>honey</b> and processed <b>bee’s</b> <b>honey</b> respectively [133]. Previous phytochemical investigation of the Nigerian sweet and bitter honey revealed total flavonoids contents of 20.81  μg/mL and 18.92  μg/mL respectively [134].|$|R
5|$|<b>Honey</b> <b>bees</b> {{are used}} commercially to produce honey. They also produce some {{substances}} used as dietary supplements with possible health benefits, pollen, propolis, and royal jelly, though {{all of these}} can also cause allergic reactions.|$|E
5|$|The {{phenomenon}} {{is particularly important}} for crops such as almond growing in California, where <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> are the predominant pollinator and the crop value in 2011 was $3.6 billion. In 2000, the total U.S. crop value that was wholly dependent on honey bee pollination was estimated to exceed $15 billion. Because of such high demand in pollinators, the cost of renting <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> has increased significantly, and California's almond industry rents approximately 1.6 million honey bee colonies during the spring to pollinate their crop. Worldwide, honeybees yield roughly $200 billion in pollination services.|$|E
5|$|A British {{beekeeper}} successfully {{developed a}} strain of bees that are resistant to varroa mites. Russian <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> also resist infestations of varroa mites but are still susceptible to other factors associated with colony collapse disorder, and have detrimental traits that limit their relevance in commercial apiculture.|$|E

5|$|In 2012, {{researchers}} announced {{findings that}} sublethal exposure to imidacloprid rendered <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> significantly {{more susceptible to}} infection by the fungus Nosema, thereby suggesting a potential link to CCD, given that Nosema is increasingly considered to contribute to CCD.|$|E
5|$|Other {{researchers}} {{state that}} colony collapse disorder is mainly {{a problem of}} feeding the bees a monoculture diet when they should receive food {{from a variety of}} sources/plants. In winter, these bees are given a single food source such as corn syrup (high-fructose or other), sugar and pollen substitute. In summer, they may only pollinate a single crop (e.g., almonds, cherries, or apples). The monoculture diet is attributed to bee rentals and migratory bee keeping. <b>Honey</b> <b>bees</b> are only being introduced to select commercial crops such as corn. These single pollen diets are greatly inferior to mixed pollen diets. However, there are a few pollens that are acceptable for <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> to be introduced to exclusively, including sweet clover and mustard.|$|E
5|$|They are {{responsible}} for pollination of approximately {{one third of the}} United States' crop species, including such species as almonds, peaches, apples, pears, cherries, raspberries, blackberries, cranberries, watermelons, cantaloupes, cucumbers, and strawberries. Many, but not all, of these plants can be (and often are) pollinated by other insects in the U.S., including other kinds of bees (e.g., squash bees on cucurbits), but typically not on a commercial scale. While some farmers of a few kinds of native crops do bring in <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> to help pollinate, none specifically need them, and when <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> are absent from a region, there is a presumption that native pollinators may reclaim the niche, typically being better adapted to serve those plants (assuming that the plants normally occur in that specific area).|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{evaluated}} the antagonistic effects of newly identified {{lactic acid bacteria}} (LAB) in the genera Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium, originating from the honey stomach, on the <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> pathogen, Paenibacillus larvae. We used inhibition assays on agar plates and <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> larval bioassays to investigate the effects of <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> LAB on P. larvae growth in vitro and on AFB infection in vivo. The individual LAB phylotypes showed different inhibition properties against P. larvae growth on agar plates, whereas {{a combination of all}} eleven LAB phylotypes resulted in a total inhibition (no visible growth) of P. larvae. Adding the LAB mixture to the larval food significantly reduced the number of AFB infected larvae in exposure bioassays. The results demonstrate that <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> specific LAB possess beneficial properties for <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> health. Possible benefits to <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> health by enhancing growth of LAB or by applying LAB to <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> colonies should be further investigated...|$|R

5|$|A {{variety of}} pollinators have been {{recorded}} visiting the flower spikes, including New Holland honeyeater (Phylidonyris novaehollandiae), red wattlebird (Anthochaera carunculata), native and European <b>honey</b> <b>bees,</b> wasps and ants. The flower spikes drip nectar onto the ground or lower leaves, suggesting pollination by nonflying mammals, which are attracted to the scent. Being upside down may facilitate this process.|$|E
5|$|Additional key {{threatening}} {{processes that}} are considered likely to impact the bristle-faced free-tailed bat include the alteration to natural flow regimes, competition from introduced western <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> (Apis mellifera) for tree hollows, inappropriate fire regimes, reduction of invertebrate prey related to pesticide drift and lack of tree regeneration due to overgrazing and weeds.|$|E
5|$|Apples are self-incompatible; {{they must}} cross-pollinate to develop fruit. During the {{flowering}} each season, apple growers often utilize pollinators to carry pollen. <b>Honey</b> <b>bees</b> are most commonly used. Orchard mason bees {{are also used}} as supplemental pollinators in commercial orchards. Bumblebee queens are sometimes present in orchards, but not usually in enough quantity to be significant pollinators.|$|E
50|$|Notable {{progress}} {{in this field}} {{was made by the}} <b>Honey</b> <b>Bee</b> Genome Sequencing Consortium, led by Gene E. Robinson, which published and made public a completed <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> (Apis mellifera) genome in October 2006.

5000|$|The western <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> or European <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> (Apis mellifera) is {{the most}} common of the 7-12 species of <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> worldwide. The genus name Apis is Latin for [...] "bee", and mellifera means [...] "honey-bearing", {{referring}} to the species' tendency to produce a large quantity of honey for storage over the winter.|$|R
50|$|Apis cerana, or {{the eastern}} <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> (and the Asiatic <b>honey</b> <b>bee),</b> is {{a species of}} <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> found in {{southern}} and southeastern Asia, including China, Pakistan, India, Korea, Japan, Malaysia, Nepal, Bangladesh, Papua New Guinea, Solomon Islands and Australia. This species is the sister species of Apis koschevnikovi, and both {{are in the same}} subgenus as the western (European) <b>honey</b> <b>bee,</b> Apis mellifera. A. cerana is known to live sympatrically as well with Apis koschevnikovi within the same geographic location. Apis cerana colonies are known for building nests consisting of multiple combs in cavities containing a small entrance, presumably for defense against invasion by individuals of another nest. The diet of this <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> species consists mostly of pollen and nectar, or honey. Moreover, Apis cerana is known for its highly social behavior, reflective of its classification as a type of <b>honey</b> <b>bee.</b>|$|R
5|$|Beekeepers in Scotland also {{reported}} losses {{for the past}} three years. Andrew Scarlett, a Perthshire-based bee farmer and honey packer, lost 80% of his 1,200 hives during the 2009/10 winter. He attributed the losses to a virulent bacterial infection that quickly spread {{because of a lack of}} bee inspectors, coupled with sustained poor weather that prevented <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> from building up sufficient pollen and nectar stores.|$|E
5|$|<b>Honey</b> <b>bees</b> are not {{native to}} the Americas, {{therefore}} their necessity as pollinators in the U.S. and other regions in the Western Hemisphere is limited to strictly agricultural/ornamental uses, as no native plants require honey bee pollination, except where concentrated in monoculture situations—where the pollination need is so great at bloom time that pollinators must be concentrated beyond the capacity of native bees (with current technology).|$|E
5|$|Human {{beekeeping}} or apiculture {{has been}} practised for millennia, {{since at least}} the times of Ancient Egypt and Ancient Greece. Apart from honey and pollination, <b>honey</b> <b>bees</b> produce beeswax, royal jelly and propolis. Bees have appeared in mythology and folklore, through all phases of art and literature, from ancient times to the present day, though primarily focused in the Northern Hemisphere, where beekeeping is far more common.|$|E

The analyses on the image line profile showed that at the voltage of 50 kV and 70 kV the three kinds of the <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> can be distinguished. However, at the voltage of 60 kV the difference among <b>honey</b> <b>bee</b> was unable to be identified...|$|R
5|$|In ancient Egypt, cattle {{were the}} most {{important}} livestock, and sheep, goats, and pigs were also kept; poultry including ducks, geese, and pigeons were captured in nets and bred on farms, where they were force-fed with dough to fatten them. The Nile provided a plentiful source of fish. <b>Honey</b> <b>bees</b> were domesticated from at least the Old Kingdom, providing both honey and wax.|$|E
5|$|Most beekeepers {{affected}} by CCD {{report that they}} use antibiotics and miticides in their colonies, though the lack of uniformity as to which particular chemicals they use makes it unlikely that any single such chemical is involved. However, {{it is possible that}} not all such chemicals in use have been tested for possible effects on <b>honey</b> <b>bees,</b> and could therefore potentially be contributing to the CCD phenomenon. Beekeepers use miticides to rid colonies of Varroa infestations; however, treatment can lead to higher levels of viral infections in colonies. High doses of treatment or the use of miticides {{for an extended period of}} time can lead to immune-suppression in <b>honey</b> <b>bees,</b> making them more susceptible to viruses. A widespread occurrence of viral infections within a beehive can lead to colony collapse. Although miticides are not a direct cause of CCD they do play a role in it.|$|E
5|$|Colony {{collapse}} disorder causes {{significant economic}} losses because many agricultural crops (although no staple foods) worldwide are pollinated by western <b>honey</b> <b>bees.</b> According to the Agriculture and Consumer Protection Department of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, {{the worth of}} global crops with honey bee pollination was estimated at close to $200 billion in 2005. Shortages of bees in the US have increased the cost to farmers renting them for pollination services by up to 20%.|$|E
