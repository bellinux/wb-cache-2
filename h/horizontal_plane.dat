5|$|The Mk 41 Stable Vertical (also called Gun Director) was a {{vertical}} seeking gyroscope. Its function {{was to establish}} and maintain a stable earth vertical with its associated <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane.</b> With the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> established, the Mk 41 continuously measured the angles between the deck and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane.</b> These deck angles were continuously transmitted to the Rangekeeper so that it could keep the guns correctly elevated as the ship rolled and pitched. Mounted waist high on its side were the battery's firing keys. (see picture) The left key was the Salvo Signal Key, and it sounded the Salvo Buzzer in each of the turrets to warn the gun crews that the guns were about to fire. The center key (with bumps on its handle for tactile identification) was the Automatic Firing Key. When this key was held closed, the Mk 41 was enabled to automatically fire the guns whenever the ship's deck was parallel the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane.</b> Also, if the sea state was such that the turrets' elevation power drives could not keep up with the ship's motion, the guns could be held at a fixed elevation, and the MK 41 could again automatically fire the guns as described. The right key was the Hand Firing Key. It bypassed the Mk 41, and fired the guns directly.|$|E
5|$|For example, a bike in a 10m (33ft) radius {{steady-state}} turn at 10m/s (36km/h, 22mph) {{must be at}} {{an angle}} of 45.6°. A rider can lean {{with respect to the}} bike in order to keep either the torso or the bike more or less upright if desired. The angle that matters is the one between the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> and the plane defined by the tire contacts and the location of the center of mass of bike and rider.|$|E
5|$|In general, {{motion is}} {{classified}} {{according to the}} anatomical plane it occurs in. Flexion and extension are examples of angular motions, in which two axes of a joint are brought closer together or moved further apart. Rotational motion may occur at other joints, for example the shoulder, and are described as internal or external. Other terms, such as elevation and depression, describe movement above or below the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane.</b> Many anatomical terms derive from Latin terms with the same meaning.|$|E
40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} C-method {{approach}} for the efficient {{calculation of the}} scattering matrix of a grating. We consider two <b>horizontal</b> <b>planes</b> {{above and below the}} grating and define a coordinate system such that the grating surface and both <b>horizontal</b> <b>planes</b> correspond to surface coordinates. Inside the area A delimited by the <b>horizontal</b> <b>planes,</b> the covariant formalism of Maxwell’s equations leads to an initial value problem that is solved for independent initial conditions satisfying the boundary conditions. Outside the area A, the fields are represented by Rayleigh expansions. The scattering matrix is obtained by using continuity relations between different components of fields on the <b>horizontal</b> <b>planes...</b>|$|R

5|$|By 25 September, {{the area}} {{occupied}} by the Lonsdale Force saw heavy fighting against self-propelled guns, flamethrower tanks, and infantry. There were no PIATs available to the force by now; instead Cain armed himself with a two-inch mortar. Mortars are muzzle-loading indirect fire weapons but Cain was forced to fire it on an almost <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane</b> due to the enemy's proximity. His citation states that his leadership ensured that the South Staffordshire gave no ground and drove the enemy off in complete disorder. By {{the end of the}} battle, Cain had been reportedly responsible for the destruction or disabling of six tanks, four of which were Tigers, {{as well as a number}} of self-propelled guns.|$|E
5|$|Cloud, a single-player {{video game}} for Microsoft Windows, {{centers on a}} boy who dreams of flying through the sky while asleep in a {{hospital}} bed. The player assumes control of the sleeping boy's avatar—the projection of the boy into his dream world—and guides him through his dream {{of a small group}} of islands with a light gathering of clouds. The avatar's direction and speed are controlled with a mouse; movement is generally on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane,</b> but vertical flight can be attained by holding down the third button of the mouse. The player may interact with clouds only while flying horizontally.|$|E
5|$|What {{was needed}} was a new bombsight, one that could be very quickly set up, had useful {{illumination}} of the crosshairs for night use and was stabilized so the bomb aimer could watch the approach as the bomber was manoeuvring. An early attempt was the Mk. XI, which mounted a cut-down CSBS {{on the front of}} a gyro unit taken from a Sperry Gyroscope artificial horizon, to provide stabilization in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane,</b> useful for aiding drift measurements and corrections. It was no easy task to manually calculate the range angle on the Course and Speed Calculator. Although introduced in 1941, only a small number were produced.|$|E

5|$|An active {{predator}} of mobile, {{relatively large}} organisms, the Portuguese dogfish feeds mainly on cephalopods (including Mastigoteuthis spp.) and bony fishes (including slickheads, orange roughy, lantern fishes, and rattails). It {{has also been}} known to take other sharks and invertebrates (such as the medusa Atolla wyvillei), as well as scavenging from whale carcasses. The Portuguese dogfish has more acute vision than many other deepsea sharks: {{in addition to having}} a large pupil and lens, and a tapetum lucidum, its eyes also contain a high concentration of ganglion cells mostly concentrated in a horizontal streak that is densest at the center; these cells impart highly sensitive motion detection along the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane.</b> The visual system of this species appears adapted for detecting bioluminescence: the maximum absorption of its visual pigments correspond to the wavelengths of light emitted by favored prey, such as the squids Heteroteuthis dispar, Histioteuthis spp., Lycoteuthis lorigera, and Taningia danae.|$|E
5|$|Some large {{primates}} such as gorillas and orang-utans (and also humans) have undeveloped ear {{muscles that}} are non-functional vestigial structures, yet are still {{large enough to}} be easily identified. An ear muscle that cannot move the ear, for whatever reason, has lost that biological function. This serves as evidence of homology between related species. In humans, there is variability in these muscles, such that some people are able to move their ears in various directions, and {{it has been said that}} it may be possible for others to gain such movement by repeated trials. In such primates, the inability to move the ear is compensated for mainly by the ability to easily turn the head on a <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane,</b> an ability which is not common to most monkeys—a function once provided by one structure is now replaced by another.|$|E
5|$|When foraging, the blackmouth {{catshark}} swings its {{head from side}} to side to employ its senses more effectively. It likely relies mainly on vision and electroreception to find food, and less on smell. As in most sharks, its visual acuity is greatest along the median <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane.</b> The lens and cone cells of its eyes are large, allowing smaller or farther objects to be discerned from the background. The rod cells of its eyes are most sensitive to the wavelengths emitted by bioluminescence, which is exhibited by most of the organisms it hunts. For electroreception, the {{blackmouth catshark}} has a high number of ampullae of Lorenzini that are evenly arranged, which enhances spatial resolution and is best suited for localizing fast-moving prey.|$|E

5|$|In the skull, the rostrum (front part) is short, the interorbital region (between the eyes) {{is broad}} and hourglass-shaped, and the braincase is small. The {{zygomatic}} plate, the flattened front {{part of the}} zygomatic arch, is narrow, with poorly developed zygomatic notches at their front, but there is considerable variation in {{the features of the}} plate. The incisive foramina (openings in the front part of the palate) extend back to between the first molars. The mesopterygoid fossa, the openings behind the bony palate, is very narrow. In the mandible (lower jaw), the masseteric ridges, which anchor some of the chewing muscles, extend to near the front margin of the first molar. The capsular process, a raising in the back part of the mandibular bone that accommodates the root of the incisor, is poorly developed. The upper incisors are orthodont (with the chewing edge in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane)</b> to slightly opisthodont (with the chewing edge inclined backwards). The molars show some accessory crests and other features, such as the anteroloph on the first upper molar and the mesoloph on the first and second upper molar.|$|E
5|$|Beetles are {{generally}} {{characterized by a}} particularly hard exoskeleton and hard forewings (elytra) not usable for flying. Almost all beetles have mandibulate mouthparts with the mandibles mobile in a <b>horizontal</b> <b>plane.</b> The mouthparts are rarely suctorial and are sometimes reduced and the maxillae always bear palps. The antennae usually have 11 or fewer segments except in some groups like the Rhipiceridae and Cerambycidae. The coxae of the legs are usually located recessed within a coxal cavity. The genitalic structures are telescoped into the last abdominal segment in all extant beetles. Unlike the adults, beetle larvae can often be confused with larvae of other endopterygote groups. The beetle's exoskeleton {{is made up of}} numerous plates, called sclerites, separated by thin sutures. This design provides armored defenses while maintaining flexibility. The general anatomy of a beetle is quite uniform, although specific organs and appendages vary greatly in appearance and function between the many families in the order. Like all insects, beetles' bodies are divided into three sections: the head, the thorax, and the abdomen. Because there are so many species, identification is quite difficult, and relies on attributes including the shape of the antennae, the tarsal formulae and shapes of these small segments on the legs, the mouthparts, and the ventral plates (sterna, pleura, coxae). In many species accurate identification can only be made by examination of the unique male genitalic structures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{problem of}} two-dimensional, {{periodic}} in the horizontal coordinate, convection of an incompressible fluid heated from below between two <b>horizontal</b> <b>planes</b> is considered. The problem is solved in two formulations: with (stress-) free and hard (no-slip) boundary {{conditions on the}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>planes.</b> It is shown that at small supercriticalities the two-dimensional convection calculation leads to more correct results with hard than with free boundary conditions. It is established {{that the difference between}} the free and hard conditions is most strongly manifested in the pulsations of the vertical ve-locity component, whereas the dependence of the Nusselt number and the pulsations of the horizontal velocity component on the boundary conditions is more weakly expressed.
