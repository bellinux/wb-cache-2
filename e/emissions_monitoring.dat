Changes in the competitiveness of various generating and pollution control technologies; a myriad of new rule making actions required by the Clean Air Act; and the possibility of new legislation limiting emissions of carbon dioxide, imposing a tax on carbon emissions, or on Btu usage were also of great concern. under Title IV (Acid Deposition Control) of the 1990 Clean Air Act Amendments."

In most cases naive use of WSNs in gas <b>emission</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{will fail to}} provide long-term and cost-effective system due to very high power requirement of most gas sensors. In this work, we support this claim by a quantitative analysis of the main operational energy costs of some popular gas sensors, radios, and sensor motes use in WSN-based gas monitoring systems. In light {{of the importance of}} sensing level energy costs for power hungry gas sensors, we consider compressed sensing as a potential approach to minimize sensing energy costs in Wireless Sensor Networks based gas <b>emission</b> <b>monitoring</b> system.
