5|$|A stylized <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> a Hippeastrum {{cultivar}} (under its {{common name}} of amaryllis) is used internationally {{as a symbol}} for organizations associated with Huntington's disease, a genetic degenerative disease of the nervous system. The widely used logo represents a double image of a head and shoulders as the <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> a growing and vibrant plant. The reduced size of the inner head and shoulders image symbolizes the diminution in a person caused by Huntington's disease. The leaves represent the protection, purpose, growth {{and development of the}} Huntington's community worldwide in its search for a cure and treatment.|$|E

5|$|As a {{particularly}} conspicuous forest flower, T. grandiflorum was designated the provincial emblem of Ontario in 1937 (Flora Emblem Act), {{and as the}} state wild <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> Ohio in 1987. As a symbol of Ontario, a stylized trillium flower features prominently on the official flag of the province's French-speaking community. It is also frequently used by the Canadian Heraldic Authority to represent Ontario in grants of arms. Although a network of laws make picking wildflowers illegal in the province on any Crown or provincially owned land, it is not, unlike widely believed, specifically illegal (or necessarily harmful) to pick the species in Ontario.|$|E
5|$|Eriophorum angustifolium is a hardy, herbaceous, rhizomatous, {{perennial}} sedge, able {{to endure}} {{in a variety}} of environments in the temperate, subarctic and arctic regions of Earth. Unlike Gossypium, the genus from which cotton is derived, the bristles which grow on E.angustifolium are unsuited to textile manufacturing. Nevertheless, in Northern Europe, they were used as a substitute in the production of paper, pillows, candle-wicks, and wound-dressings. The indigenous peoples of North America use the plant in cooking and in the treatment of digestive problems. Following a vote in 2002, Plantlife International designated E.angustifolium the County <b>Flower</b> <b>of</b> Greater Manchester, as part of its British County Flowers campaign.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the show}} faced {{criticism}} from viewers for not intervening when a meerkat was injured and faced death, as a whole, Meerkat Manor enjoyed considerable success and was Animal Planet's top series in October 2007, {{both on the}} cable channel and through its video-on-demand service. The show's experimental format broke new ground in animal documentary filming techniques and allowed viewers a long term, intimate look {{into the lives of}} its meerkat stars, breaking the traditional wall between viewer and subject found with most documentaries. In 2007, Meerkat Manor was nominated for two Primetime Emmy Awards. It has won three awards at the 2006 Omni Awards, and at the 2006 and 2007 New York Festivals Award Galas. The first three series of the programme have been released to DVD in both Region 1 and Region 2. In 2007, a book entitled Meerkat Manor – The Story of <b>Flower</b> <b>of</b> the Kalahari was released in the UK, detailing the life of Flower and the Whiskers before the series' filming began. A television film, , documenting Flower's birth and rise to matriarch of the Whiskers aired on Animal Planet on 25 May 2008.|$|E

5|$|Although {{there is}} no clear {{evidence}} that the flower's name derives directly from the Greek myth, this link between the flower and the myth became firmly part of western culture. The narcissus or daffodil is the most loved of all English plants, and appears frequently in English literature. Many English writers have referred to the cultural and symbolic importance of Narcissus). No flower has received more poetic description except the rose and the lily, with poems by authors from John Gower, Shakespeare, Milton (see Roman culture, above), Wordsworth, Shelley and Keats. Frequently the poems deal with self-love derived from Ovid's account. Gower's reference to the yellow <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> the legend has been assumed to be the daffodil or Narcissus, though as with all references in the older literature to the flower that sprang from the youth's death, there is room for some debate as to the exact species of flower indicated, some preferring Crocus. Spenser announces the coming of the Daffodil in Aprill of his Shepheardes Calender (1579).|$|E
5|$|Barbara Ketcham Wheaton and Stephen Mennell {{provided}} the definitive arguments against these claims. They {{point out that}} Catherine’s father-in-law, King Francis I, and the <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> the French aristocracy had dined at some of Italy’s most élite tables during the king’s Italian campaigns (and that an earlier generation had done so during King Charles VIII’s invasion of 1494); that a vast Italian entourage had visited France for the wedding of Catherine de’ Medici’s father to her French-born mother; {{and that she had}} little influence at court until her husband’s death because he was so besotted by his mistress, Diane de Poitiers. In fact, a large population of Italians—bankers, silk-weavers, philosophers, musicians, and artists, including Leonardo da Vinci—had emigrated to France to promote the burgeoning Renaissance. Nevertheless, popular culture frequently attributes Italian culinary influence and forks in France to Catherine.|$|E
5|$|Clover, sorrel, nettle and thistle are common, {{and grow}} wild in Greater Manchester. Common heather (Calluna vulgaris) dominates the uplands, such as Saddleworth Moor, which lies within the South Pennines and Dark Peak {{area of the}} Peak District National Park. The Rochdale Canal {{harbours}} floating water-plantain (Luronium), an endangered aquatic plant. In 2002, Plantlife International launched its County Flowers campaign, asking {{members of the public}} to nominate and vote for a wild flower emblem for their county. Common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), a plant with fluffy white plumes native to wet hollows on high moors, was announced as the county <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> Greater Manchester. The house sparrow, common starling, and common blackbird are among the most populous bird species in Greater Manchester; Eurasian magpie and feral pigeon are common and breed in habitats across the county. The South Pennines support internationally important numbers of European golden plover, curlew, merlin and twite.|$|E

5|$|Gyeongju is {{strongly}} associated with the education tradition of Hwarangdo ("Way of the <b>Flower</b> <b>of</b> Young Men") which was established and flourished during the Silla period. It is a military and philosophical code that offered the basis of training to Hwarang, a military cadet of youths from the aristocratic class. The training equally emphasized practicing academic and martial arts based on Buddhism and patriotism. A number of Silla's greatest generals and military leaders such as Kim Yu-sin were Hwarang who {{played a central role}} in Silla unification of the Korean peninsula. As Silla was integrated into the next ruling dynasty, Goryeo, the system declined and was officially disbanded in the Joseon dynasty. However, the spirit and discipline were revived in the second half of the 20th century as a form of Korean martial arts with the same name.|$|E
5|$|Historical {{accounts}} suggest narcissi {{have been}} cultivated {{from the earliest}} times, but became increasingly popular in Europe after the 16th century and by the late 19th century were an important commercial crop centred primarily on the Netherlands. Today narcissi are popular as cut flowers and as ornamental plants in private and public gardens. The long history of breeding has resulted in thousands of different cultivars. For horticultural purposes, narcissi are classified into divisions, covering {{a wide range of}} shapes and colours. Like other members of their family, narcissi produce a number of different alkaloids, which provide some protection for the plant, but may be poisonous if accidentally ingested. This property has been exploited for medicinal use in traditional healing and has resulted in the production of galantamine for the treatment of Alzheimer's dementia. Long celebrated in art and literature, narcissi are associated with a number of themes in different cultures, ranging from death to good fortune, and as symbols of spring. The daffodil is the national <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> Wales and the symbol of cancer charities in many countries. The appearance of the wild flowers in spring is associated with festivals in many places.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{executed}} Mstislav of Kiev and the Kievan nobles {{with the}} traditional Mongol caveat reserved for royalty and nobility: without shedding blood. Mstislav and his nobles were buried and suffocated under the Mongol general's victory platform at the victory feast. Meanwhile, Mstislav the Bold managed to reach {{the western side of}} the Dnieper with what remained of his army. To stop the Mongols from crossing to the western side of the Dnieper, Mstislav destroyed all the boats he could find.* de Hartog, Genghis Khan: Conqueror of the World, 122* Hector Hugh Munro, The Rise of the Russian Empire, p. 84. After the battle, the people of Rus trembled in fear of this unknown scourge who had emerged from the frontier and destroyed the <b>flower</b> <b>of</b> their army. However, the Mongols were not there to conquer, and merely marched east after plundering.|$|E

60|$|The peloric <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> Pelargonium {{have their}} five petals {{in all respects}} alike, {{and there is no}} nectary so that they {{resemble}} the symmetrical <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> the closely allied genus Geranium; but the alternate stamens are also sometimes destitute of anthers, the shortened filaments being left as rudiments, and in this respect they resemble the symmetrical <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> the closely allied genus Erodium. Hence we may look at the peloric <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> Pelargonium as having reverted to the state of some primordial form, the progenitor of the three closely related genera of Pelargonium, Geranium, and Erodium.|$|R
40|$|Two {{plant species}} {{belonging}} to the genus Brunfelsia, commonly known as ‘‘Yesterday-Today-and-Tomorrow'', are closely related, however, differ by their <b>flower</b> fragrance. <b>Flowers</b> <b>of</b> Brunfelsia australis present a pleasant fragrance, whereas <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> Brunfelsia pauciflora are scentless. SPME/GC/MS analysis on <b>flower</b> samples <b>of</b> both species of Brunfelsia indicated that <b>flowers</b> <b>of</b> B. australis emitted a fresh flowery fragrance, essentially comprising two monoterpenic compounds (linalool and (E) -ocimene). B. pauciflora, on the other hand, produced only a few sesquiterpenoids. These results are considered in an ecological and evolutionary context...|$|R
