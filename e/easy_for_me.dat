In the summers, he slept outside in the family orchard to have a quiet place to read and enjoyed an idyllic country life. One one evening observing nature, Arrington had a transcendent {{experience}} where he felt [...] "an intimate kinship with the world" [...] which he said [...] "made it <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> [...] to integrate personal religious experiences and intuitions with the more formal affirmations, practices, forms, and ceremonies of the organized church." ...|$|E

500|$|Fordham {{described}} Mehldau's compositions as [...] "miniature tapestries of taut lyricism {{and surprising}} turns". Mehldau himself indicated {{that some of}} his compositions address a specific need, such as integrating a particular rhythm into his trio, while others emerge from something he has played while improvising. In the latter case, Mehldau likened the difficulty of the composition process to that of a game of chess: [...] "The opening is always <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> the middle gets more difficult, more of an intellectual process, more trial and error at work, and the end is always difficult for me." [...] These struggles to find satisfactory endings stem from the tension between needing to close a piece and his desire to leave a sense of open-endedness – [...] "an escape duct of possibility".|$|E

However, her Quattro later incurred gearbox problems and she retired from fifth place after sliding {{off the road}} into a snow-filled ditch. Mouton would later state: [...] "For me, rallying is England. No pacenotes – just you in the car having to do the fastest time. This, to me, is rallying. OK, it was not <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> because I did not have experience there of the British championship, but it is really rallying. I like it very much." [...] Mouton finished the season in eighth place in the drivers' championship, while Audi was fifth in the manufacturers' standings.|$|E

'cause at that certain time of my life, I was actually going through that kind of thing," [...] Clarkson said. [...] "I've always been real guarded about work and career. It wasn't even with, like, guy relationships, it was just, like, friends and just letting people in, you know? And so it was kinda weird 'cause I was going through that same thing at the same time, so it was very <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to write the bridge to the song." ...|$|E
500|$|Mulan {{served as}} Wen's first voice-acting role. In an {{interview}} with IGN, the actress elaborated on the recording process, specifically {{the fact that she}} was required to record the majority of the character's dialogue in isolation, saying, [...] "I just loved the story so much and identified so much with the character of Mulan it was <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> I loved using my imagination. I felt like I was a little kid again, being silly with an imaginary sword and riding on an imaginary horse and talking to an imaginary dragon. So it was a lot of fun for me." [...] In spite of the fact that, throughout the film, Mulan shares several intimate scenes with her guardian, a miniature Chinese dragon named Mushu who is voiced by American actor and comedian Eddie Murphy, Wen and her co-star never actually encountered each other while working on Mulan due to the fact that they recorded their respective dialogue at separate times in separate locations.|$|E

However, Kazinsky said they {{developed}} a bond while filming, [...] "Because we were working so tight together, we would finish and then we would go out for dinner every night and we would go to the gym together on days off we had… The emotional scene toward the end with the father-son parting, it was very <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to play because I had grown to actually genuinely love Max as a man and as a friend." [...] Kazinsky revealed that Herc and Chuck's pet bulldog was del Toro's idea and said, [...] "The dog's name was Max, ironically, and we ended up using Max for so many things. The story was that Herc and Chuck have difficulty communicating, that they communicated via the dog, and all the love that they couldn't show each other they would show the dog." [...] The role was originally written for Ron Perlman, but del Toro decided the scenes between Perlman's Herc and Hunnam's Raleigh [...] "might start to feel like Sons of Anarchy 2.0".|$|E

The episode's title refers to the song [...] "", by American alternative rock group Community Trolls. Featured music includes The Voluntary Butler Scheme's [...] "Trading Things In" [...] and Dragonette's [...] "Come On Be Good". Pompeo was pregnant during the episode, so the filming crew had to work around it. In the episode, Lexie advocated for Meredith to donate her liver, because she was unable to. Bans commented on this: [...] "It was REALLY <b>easy</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to understand Lexie in this episode – 'cause that's how I imagine she grew up with [...] and Thatcher. There was taco night, and movie night, and if she had homework issues, {{one of them was}} always around to help. So now that her Dad needs some of her liver, recovering alcoholic or not, she’s gonna do it. She's not even thinking about the Chief's upcoming merger – and the fact that recovering from a major surgery will put her on the bench, out of the game, for at least a month. Lexie doesn't blink, because family isn't an obligation to her like it is {{for a lot of people}} - [...] it's a gift." [...] The scene in which Meredith offers her liver to Thatcher was originally intended to rekindle their relationship. Bans later changed this, following a request from Pompeo, and offered her insight: ...|$|E

I can’t vote for either of those two people." [...] He suggested that he may vote for a third-party candidate, or write-in his wife's name, saying she would be [...] "an ideal president". When pressed on who of Trump and Clinton was more qualified to be President, Romney quoted P. J.

A spokeswoman for Romney said that the list had been [...] "rented by several political candidates in the presidential primary, and by countless other political and commercial users in the time since the 2012 campaign" [...] and Romney made no public comment on McMullin's candidacy.
