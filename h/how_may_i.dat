6000|$|... "A rather {{discouraging}} {{thought for}} your race. But answer: I assume that King Media {{is but a}} mortal like you; now, <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> best perpetuate my name?" ...|$|E
6000|$|To this Sir Percival said: [...] "Messire, tell me, <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> hope {{to acquire}} craft at arms such as may serve me {{in such a}} stead as this?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'He must be good! he can't help it! He has you!' said Gilbert. 'See, he {{is opening}} his eyes--oh! <b>how</b> blue! <b>May</b> <b>I</b> touch him?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I really cannot tell. I cannot even guess; but, let him live <b>how</b> he <b>may,</b> <b>I</b> {{will not}} {{absolutely}} ruin myself for his sake." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of course I am anxious {{that you}} should have a home of your own;--but let it be <b>how</b> it <b>may</b> <b>I</b> will not quarrel with my child." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ernest. How can I thank thee for thy {{tenderness}} and pity; <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> best show the gratitude I owe thee for the priceless boon of freedom thou hast this day given? ...|$|E
6000|$|... “How oft {{when men}} {{are at the}} point of death Have they been merry! which their keepers call A {{lightning}} before death. O, <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> Call this a lightning?—--O, my love, my wife!” &c.|$|E
6000|$|... "And how {{may that}} be?" [...] said the prior; [...] "the false fiend hath deceived me; I {{have given him}} my soul, but have {{received}} no worldly benefit in return. Brother! dear brother! <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> escape?" ...|$|E
6000|$|But Fanny {{was holding}} up my {{envelope}} between both her thumbs and forefingers, and steadily smiling at me, over its margin. [...] "A joke, Midgetina; {{and one of}} your very own. How exciting. And <b>how</b> bulgy. <b>May</b> <b>I</b> open it? I wouldn't miss it for the world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why, Midgetina," [...] whispered Fanny, delicately {{counting}} the notes over between her long, white fingers, [...] "you are richer than I supposed--a female Croesus. Wasn't {{it a great}} risk? I mean," [...] she continued, receiving no answer, [...] "no wonder he was so cautious. And <b>how</b> much <b>may</b> <b>I</b> take?" ...|$|R
60|$|This time, I {{not only}} {{went to the}} door, but went fairly {{out on the road}} back. Explain it <b>how</b> you <b>may,</b> <b>I</b> felt as if one or both of them had mortally {{offended}} me. Before I had taken three steps down the village, I heard the Sergeant behind me.|$|R
6000|$|How oft {{when men}} {{are at the}} point of death [...] Have they been merry! which their keepers call [...] A {{lightning}} before death. O, <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> [...] Call this a lightning?--O, my love, my wife! &c.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is true," [...] {{said the}} King's daughter, [...] "that you pipe {{the song of}} the morrow; but that ye have power upon the hour, <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> know that? Show me a marvel here upon the beach, between the waves and the dead leaves." ...|$|E
6000|$|At this repentance of Sir Mellegrans Sir Launcelot {{was very}} greatly astonished. But {{yet he was}} much adoubt as to the true faith of that knight; {{wherefore}} he said: [...] "Sir Knight, <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> know that that which thou art telling me is the truth?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Mademoiselle," [...] {{interrupted}} David, {{his eyes}} shining {{with the desire}} to do her service, [...] "your hopes shall be my wings. Tell me <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> reach him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sir," [...] said Richard, [...] "I will {{pray for}} you, indeed; though <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> prevail <b>I</b> wot not. But if ye have so long pursued revenge, {{and find it}} now of such a sorry flavour, bethink ye, were it not well to pardon others? Hatch--he is dead, poor shrew! I would have spared a better; and for Sir Daniel, here lies his body. But for the priest, if I might anywise prevail, I would have you let him go." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I intended; so I do intend; {{but still}} I must leave {{it for a}} while. I'm going about business, and I don't know <b>how</b> long <b>I</b> <b>may</b> be away. <b>I</b> go on Saturday." ...|$|R
6000|$|A {{stronger}} feeling than compassion {{moved the}} heart of Tisbina at these words. [...] "This indeed," [...] replied she, [...] "I feel to be noble; and truly could I also now die to save you. But life is flitting; and <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> prove my regard?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nor can he force us, for a {{dozen men}} may hold the narrow way to Marentina against a million. But now, as to thine own affairs. <b>How</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> aid you? My palace is at your disposal, {{if you wish to}} honor me by coming to Marentina." ...|$|E
6000|$|XXV [...] All men may {{understanding}} have of me, [...] But, Nightingale, so may {{they not}} of thee; [...] For thou hast many a foolish and quaint cry:-- [...] Thou say'st, OSEE, OSEE, then <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> [...] Have knowledge, I thee pray, what this may be? [...] 125 ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, but doctor, you ain't {{going to}} leave me so. What am I to do? What doses shall I take? <b>How</b> much brandy <b>may</b> <b>I</b> drink? <b>May</b> <b>I</b> have a grill for dinner? D---- me, doctor, you have turned Fillgrave out of the house. You mustn't go and desert me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I really don't know," [...] said Maitland. [...] "I have {{business}} in Paris, and I cannot say <b>how</b> long <b>I</b> <b>may</b> be detained on the Continent." ...|$|R
60|$|P.S.--When {{you have}} done the subject, I wish you'd write me one line and tell me <b>how,</b> that <b>I</b> <b>may</b> be sure we agree. Loves from Kate.|$|R
6000|$|... "The witch-doctors rule in Zululand, and not I, Mopo, son of Makedama," [...] {{he said to}} me. [...] "Where, then, is it to end? Shall I myself be smelt out and slain? These Isanusis are {{too strong}} for me; they lie upon the land like the shadow of night. Tell me, <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> be free of them?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then Sir Percival said: [...] "Lady, we {{came not}} hither upon any such {{adventure}} {{as that of}} trying the skill of your champion, but what you inform us concerning him giveth me a great appetite to try of what mettle he is. Now I pray you tell me, <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> come at this knight so as to adventure myself against him." ...|$|E
6000|$|That I ever {{shall see}} her again seems but {{remotely}} possible, for <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> know upon what part of Pellucidar my return journey may terminate--and how, without a north or south or an east or a west may I hope ever to find my way across that vast world to the tiny spot where my lost love lies grieving for me? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Do as {{you feel}} right at the moment," [...] said Ermine, after a moment's pause. [...] "I cannot tell <b>how</b> it <b>may</b> be. <b>I</b> have been {{thinking}} over {{what you told me}} about the Major and Lady Temple." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't know <b>how</b> that <b>may</b> be. <b>I</b> {{think my}} girl {{might have done}} better. I told her so, and I just tell you the same. She might a' done a deal better, but women is always restive." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Bless me, {{these are}} things I never think of. I do not even know how much my own father is worth. Mother tells me <b>how</b> much <b>I</b> <b>may</b> spend, and <b>I</b> can want to learn no more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will pray God {{to make me}} more desirous {{and more}} able to follow the holy example you leave behind. Oh that the peace of God may be given to me also when I come to die; though <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> dare to hope for such an end, so full of faith and love and the patient waiting for Christ! ...|$|E
6000|$|O Sacred Essence, {{lighting}} me this hour, [...] <b>How</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> lightly stile thy great power? [...] Echo. [...] Power. [...] Power! but of whence? {{under the}} greenwood spraye? [...] Or liv'st in Heaven? saye. [...] Echo. [...] In Heavens aye. [...] In Heavens aye! tell, may I it obtayne [...] By alms, by fasting, prayer,--by paine? [...] Echo. [...] By paine [...] Show me the paine, {{it shall be}} undergone. [...] I to mine end will still go on. [...] Echo. [...] Go on.|$|E
6000|$|... "Here {{are many}} huts," [...] said the voice, [...] "now <b>how</b> <b>may</b> <b>I</b> know {{which is the}} house of my brother? Perhaps if I call I shall bring {{soldiers}} to me, and be forced to play the man before them, and I am weary of that. Well, I will lie here under the fence till morning; it is a softer bed than some I have found, and I am worn out with travel--sleep I must," [...] and the figure sighed and turned so that {{the light of the}} moon fell full upon its face.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{know not}} <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> have earned this false {{character}} among my friends," [...] she said; [...] "for {{to me it}} ever seemeth that what I feel and think is but too easily known." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>may</b> {{not tell}} thee, thou and thou alone stoodst {{between me and}} the full {{discharge}} of this most dreadful debt--for know that in mercy it is given to us to redeem one another." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly, my dear,--certainly. Only I do {{not like}} not going;--for who can say <b>how</b> often <b>I</b> <b>may</b> {{be able to go}} again? There is so little left, Susan,--so very little left." ...|$|R
