25|$|There was {{outrage over}} the closure plan: critics pointed out {{that this was a}} main line, not a small branch railway. The {{campaign}} uncovered evidence that British Rail had mounted a <b>dirty</b> <b>tricks</b> campaign against the line, exaggerating the cost of repairs (£6million for Ribblehead Viaduct alone) and diverting traffic away from the line in order to justify its closure plans, a process referred to as closure by stealth.|$|E

25|$|After Florida, {{the campaigns}} focused their {{attention}} on the 21 states voting on February 5, known as Super Tuesday. McCain {{was seen as the}} front-runner for the nomination heading in to this most important of primary dates. He had the lead in delegates to the national convention, and on January 30 he was officially endorsed by the withdrawing Giuliani. The candidates sparred at a debate at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in Simi Valley, California on January 30, with former First Lady Nancy Reagan present in the front row. The most heated exchange came as Romney accused McCain of <b>dirty</b> <b>tricks</b> in his misleading Florida statements about Romney having proposed an Iraq withdrawal timetable.|$|E
25|$|During the {{confirmation}} hearing, Gray defended his bureau's investigation. During questioning, he volunteered {{that he had}} provided copies {{of some of the}} files on the investigation to White House Counsel John Dean, who had told Gray he was conducting an investigation for the President. Gray testified that before turning over the files to Dean, he had been advised by the FBI's own legal counsel that he was required by law to comply with Dean's order. He confirmed that the investigation supported claims made by The Washington Post and other sources of <b>dirty</b> <b>tricks</b> committed and funded by the Committee to Re-Elect the President, notably activities of questionable legality committed by Donald Segretti. The White House had for months steadfastly denied any involvement in such activities.|$|E
25|$|On February 1, McCain won a 49–30% {{victory over}} Bush in the New Hampshire primary. Gary Bauer dropped out. After coming in third in Delaware Forbes dropped out, leaving three candidates. In the South Carolina primary, Bush soundly {{defeated}} McCain. Some McCain supporters {{blamed it on}} the Bush campaign, accusing them of mudslinging and <b>dirty</b> <b>tricks,</b> such as push polling that implied that McCain's adopted Bangladeshi-born daughter was an African-American child he fathered out of wedlock. While McCain's loss in South Carolina damaged his campaign, he won both Michigan and {{his home state of}} Arizona on February 22. The primary election that year also affected the South Carolina State House, when a controversy about the Confederate flag flying over the capitol dome prompted the state legislature to move the flag to a less prominent position at a Civil War memorial on the capitol grounds. Most GOP candidates said the issue should be left to South Carolina voters, though McCain later recanted and said the flag should be removed.|$|E

25|$|The {{campaign}} was overshadowed by U.S. media criticism of Kỳ and Thiệu's unfair electoral practices and sneaky tricks. All the candidates {{were scheduled to}} attend a rally at Quảng Trị in the far north of the country on 6 August. Owing to the security situation {{and the possibility of}} communist attacks, the politicians were transported to joint campaign events by the military, rather than being free to go to separate events as their strategy dictated. However, the Quảng Trị event had to be canceled after the candidates’ plane landed 23km away at an air base in Đông Hà. Believing that the mishap was a deliberate attempt to make them look chaotic and disorganized—Thiệu and Kỳ had decided not to attend rallies—the candidates boycotted the event and flew back to Saigon. There they denounced the government bitterly. The leading opposition candidate, Trần Văn Hương, claimed that Thiệu and Kỳ “purposefully arranged the trip to humiliate us and make clowns out of us.” As air force chief, Kỳ had previously stranded opposition politicians on a trip to the Central Highlands. Kỳ and Thiệu maintained that no malice was involved, but their opponents did not believe it. None of the candidates made good on their threat to withdraw, but their strident attacks over the alleged <b>dirty</b> <b>tricks</b> dominated the media coverage of the election for a period.|$|E

Former congressman Voorhis dubbed himself [...] "the first victim of the Nixon-Chotiner formula for political success". Democrats labeled him a master of <b>dirty</b> <b>tricks</b> who ruthlessly destroyed Douglas's political career by intimating that she was soft on communism. Chotiner's son Kenneth later stated, [...] "I think he really believed [...] was evil... He would equate a liberal or a Democrat with a communist." [...] Chotiner himself said of the campaign against Douglas, [...] "We only stated the facts. The interpretation of the facts was the prerogative of the electorate." ...|$|E

They wore French uniforms, flak jackets, helmets, and personal weapons and drove a French armoured personnel carrier (APC) – all stolen from UN troops detained outside the city. The Serbs disarmed the 12 peacekeepers on the bridge at gunpoint. Ten were taken to an unknown destination while two remained on the site as human shields. According to Colonel Erik Sandahl, commander of the 4th French Battalion (FREBAT4) which was at that time provided by the 3rd Marine Infantry Regiment, [...] "when the Serbs took our soldiers under their control by threat, by <b>dirty</b> <b>tricks,</b> they began to act as terrorists, you cannot support this.

As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had {{a change}} of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. [...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very difficult for me to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to critics, the {{supposed}} behind-the-scenes processes were more often flights of fancy than inside information. Douglas Foster wrote in Mother Jones in 1982 that the briefings consisted of disinformation, [...] "hate-filled" [...] material about enemies, phony letters, intimidation, fake newspaper articles, and <b>dirty</b> <b>tricks</b> campaigns.

2500|$|After the 1980 election, Atwater went to Washington {{and became}} an aide in the Ronald Reagan administration, working under {{political}} director Ed Rollins. In 1984, Rollins managed Reagan's re-election campaign, and Atwater became the campaign's deputy director and political director. Rollins mentions Atwater's work several times in his 1996 book Bare Knuckles and Back Rooms. He states that Atwater ran a <b>dirty</b> <b>tricks</b> operation against Democratic vice-presidential nominee Geraldine Ferraro, including publicizing the fact that Ferraro's parents had been indicted on numbers running in the 1940s. Rollins also described Atwater as [...] "ruthless", [...] "Ollie North in civilian clothes", and someone who [...] "just had to drive in one more stake".|$|E

[...] Frontline quoted U.S. diplomat and Nixon assistant Robert Ellsworth, who stated: [...] "They were very specific about their effort to destroy American intelligence [...] It was Senator Church who said our intelligence agencies were 'rogue elephants.' They were supposedly out there assassinating people and playing <b>dirty</b> <b>tricks</b> and so forth... Well, that just wasn't true." [...] Rumsfeld and Ellsworth prevented the committees from dismantling the CIA and other intelligence organizations.|$|E
2500|$|The revelations in Dirty Politics {{have also}} been {{reported}} in international media. Under the headline [...] "New Zealand's own House of Cards is collapsing", The Guardian newspaper said [...] "New Zealanders are currently witnesses to an expose of unprecedented proportions." [...] Also in The Guardian, New Zealand journalist Toby Manhire wrote: [...] "Dirty Politics has blown the National party (election) strategy dramatically off course, propelling the campaign into uncharted territory. Its allegations have dominated news bulletins for the 10 days since its publication, as accusations of <b>dirty</b> <b>tricks,</b> smear campaigns and conspiracy sally in every direction." [...] In addition to the calls for Judith Collins to resign, Manhire suggested that John Key's [...] "sparkling reputation" [...] may be [...] "contaminated by association with Slater’s toxic style." ...|$|E
2500|$|Mazzocchi's {{efforts on}} health and safety boosted his {{political}} popularity within the union. In 1977, he defeated the incumbent Elwood Swisher to become vice president of OCAW. Encouraged by supporters, {{he ran for president}} of the union in 1979 when Alvin F. Grospiron retired. [...] He lost to Robert Goss by 1 percent of the vote. He challenged Goss for the presidency again in 1981. But the disaffiliation of most of OCAW's Canadian membership and the breakup of the environmental-union coalition over the issue of job protections led to a second defeat (again by less than 1 percent of the vote). Some accused Goss, who had strong ties to the CIA, of <b>dirty</b> <b>tricks</b> during the election. Others pointed out that many OCAW members were unhappy with Mazzocchi's views on nuclear disarmament and the environment.|$|E
