A skeptical argument of this type will involve knowledge of some piece of widely accepted information to be knowledge, which will then be pointed out to entail knowledge of some skeptical scenario, such as the brain in a vat scenario or the cartesian evil demon scenario. A skeptic might say, for example, <b>that</b> if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have hands, then <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not a handless brain in a vat (because knowledge <b>that</b> <b>you</b> have hands implies <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> you are not handless, and if <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not handless, then <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> are not a handless brain in a vat).
