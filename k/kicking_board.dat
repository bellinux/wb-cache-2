50|$|These feet can {{be secured}} {{to the bottom}} of the cabinet by having the leg base screwed onto the cabinet bottom. They can also be {{attached}} by means of a hole drilled through the cabinet bottom at specific locations. The legs are then attached to the cabinet bottom by a slotted, hollow machine screw. The height of the cabinet can be adjusted from inside the cabinet, simply by inserting a screwdriver into the slot and turning to raise or lower the cabinet. The holes in the cabinet are capped by plastic inserts, making the appearance more acceptable for residential cabinets. Using these feet, the cabinets need not be shimmed or scribed to the floor for leveling. The toe <b>kick</b> <b>board</b> is attached to the cabinet by means of a clip, which is either screwed onto the back side of the <b>kick</b> <b>board,</b> or a barbed plastic clip is inserted into a saw kerf, also made on the back side of the <b>kick</b> <b>board.</b> This toe <b>kick</b> <b>board</b> can be made to fit each base cabinet, or made to fit a run of cabinets.|$|R

5000|$|Guy Delage, {{the first}} person to {{allegedly}} swim across the Atlantic {{with the help of a}} <b>kick</b> <b>board</b> from the Cape Verde Islands to Barbados in 1994.|$|R
50|$|Guy Delage {{claims he}} is the first person to swim solo across the Atlantic Ocean (with the help of a <b>kick</b> <b>board,</b> from the Cape Verde Islands to Barbados). 16 December 1994.Logging six to eight hours a day behind a 15 ft raft that carried his {{communications}} gear and food supply, Delage ate and slept on the craft when not in the water. After 55 days he had covered 2,100 nmi km.|$|R

50|$|Benoît Lecomte (born 1967) is a French-born long {{distance}} swimmer (now a naturalized {{citizen of the}} U.S.A.) who has received wide credit for being {{the first man to}} swim across the Atlantic Ocean without a <b>kick</b> <b>board</b> in 1998, though this has not been recognised by the Guinness World Records. He did this to raise money for cancer research as a tribute to his father. During his 3,716 mile journey in 73 days, he was accompanied by a 40 ft. sailboat that had an electromagnetic field for 25 feet to ward off sharks. He was followed by a great white shark for 5 days. He also encountered sea turtles, dolphins, and jellyfish.|$|R

50|$|To {{perform the}} {{nightmare}} flip aerial trick, the skateboarder <b>kicks</b> his <b>board</b> {{in order to}} make it flip 720 degrees along the board's long axis, while turning in a 180 degree motion toward the toe edge of the board, essentially combining a double kickflip, and a pop shove it.|$|R
50|$|A shove-it in pineboarding is {{basically}} the same movement {{as it is in}} skateboarding. The feet <b>kick</b> the <b>board</b> into a 180 or 360 degree rotation. The board stays in contact with the slope but the feet are in the air above the board as it rotates (originally a skateboarding move).|$|R
50|$|The first {{cause of}} {{swimmers}} shoulder is overuse. Overuse {{of the shoulder}} muscles and surrounding muscles can lead to fatigue of the muscles. Due to the muscles being fatigued {{they are in a}} weakened state and with continuous use will therefore work less effectively when swimming and will result in the swimmer having to work the shoulder muscles twice as hard by taking double the amount of strokes they would usually take in order to cover the same distance. This would ultimately result in more fatigue and inflammation of the muscles. Unilateral breathing may also cause swimmers shoulder {{due to the fact that}} the opposite shoulder to the breathing arm has to work harder to support balanced position and forward movement while the head is turned. Some training equipment such as paddles and <b>kick</b> <b>boards</b> can also put stress on the shoulder and surrounding muscles and cause fatigue and inflammation.|$|R

50|$|Andy Murray was the {{defending}} champion, but {{lost in the}} second round to Nicolas Mahut.Marin Čilić won the final after David Nalbandian was defaulted from the tournament for <b>kicking</b> an advertising <b>board,</b> resulting in a cut leg for a line judge.|$|R
50|$|The Kickback is {{a really}} old {{freestyle}} trick, involving a half flip backwards and then a {{one and a half}} flips forwards. It is done by placing your front foot on the front bolts and the toes of the back foot along the heelside edge in the middle of your board. You start pushing down on the toes of the back foot and when the board catches your toes, you jump, <b>kick</b> the <b>board</b> forwards, and catch it on the grip tape.|$|R

50|$|The {{following}} season saw Clarke score six further goals, {{including one}} against Crystal Palace {{on the final}} day of the season in a match that could have seen either side relegated from the Championship. However, in celebrating the goal, he <b>kicked</b> the advertising <b>boarding,</b> dislocated his toe and had to be substituted. The game finished 2-2, which saw Wednesday relegated to League One. Three days later it was announced he would not be offered a new contract.|$|R
50|$|The {{novel was}} about Ted Jenkins, a farmer's son, is <b>kicked</b> out of <b>boarding</b> school for {{addiction}} to dope; {{when his father}} finds out, he kicks Ted off their property as well. Ted moves to Sydney and becomes homeless; he thinks about killing himself when he sees a young woman, Carmol, thinking of killing herself, too. They decide {{not to do it}} and Carmol nurses Ted back to health. The two form a strong bond (though not a romantic one - Ted's love is for Nibs, the daughter of Ted's father's best friend).|$|R
50|$|After Brad died saving Sharon's son Noah Newman from {{drowning}} in a frozen pond, Colleen resolved to honor her father's memory by stepping {{into his seat}} on the Newman Enterprises board of directors. She angrily lashed out at the company's founder and CEO, Victor Newman, Brad's long-time rival, as she believed he is partly to blame for her father's death. Victor paid Jeffrey and Gloria Bardwell to catch Colleen in a compromising situation so she could be <b>kicked</b> off the <b>board.</b> They succeeded by paying a bartender to get her drunk and tape her flashing her breasts in public.|$|R
5000|$|A Railstand is {{when one}} {{edge of your}} board {{is on the ground}} and you are {{standing}} on the other, usually with your feet also on the wheels. From this position you can do many tricks, including Flips, 180s, 360 Spins and combinations of the above (landing into another railstand if you wish), landing into Casper, into 50/50, etc. The railstand and many variations were invented in the 1970s by Bobby [...] "Casper" [...] Boyden. A Heelside Railstand is to stand on the board in railstand, with your griptape facing your back, and toeside is the reverse. There are several ways to get into Heelside Railstand as opposed to the limited ways, if not just one way of getting into Toeside Railstand. A common variation of a Railstand is a Cooperstand, which is a Railstand with one foot on a wheel, and the other on the nose. While in Railstand, the limit to what you can do is almost non existent. You do not have to just flip. You can <b>kick</b> the <b>board</b> under you so it spins without flipping while you stand on one wheel, you can walk along the rail in a series of cross-stepping maneuvers, or you can spin a 360 on one wheel while the board remains in place.|$|R
6000|$|At {{another time}} her mother {{might have been}} startled at her passive obedience. Still more would she have been startled had she seen her daughter's face now, behind the closed door--with her little mouth set over her clenched teeth. And yet {{it was her own}} child, and Lanty was her mother's real daughter; the same pioneer blood filled their veins, the blood that had never nourished cravens or degenerates, but had given itself to {{sprinkle}} and fertilize desert solitudes where man might follow. Small wonder, then, that this frontier-born Lanty, whose first infant cry had been answered by the yelp of wolf and scream of panther; whose father's rifle had been leveled across her cradle to cover the stealthy Indian who prowled outside, small wonder that she should feel herself equal to these [...] "man's doin's," [...] and prompt to take a part. For even in the first shock of the news of the capture she recalled the fact that the barn was old and rotten, that only that day the filly had <b>kicked</b> a <b>board</b> loose from behind her stall, which she, Lanty, had lightly returned to avoid [...] "making a fuss." [...] If his captors had not noticed it, or trusted only to their guards, she might make the opening wide enough to free him! ...|$|R
500|$|Screenwriter Dan Gerson joined Pixar in 1999 {{and worked}} on the film with the filmmakers {{on a daily basis}} for almost two years. He {{considered}} it his first experience in writing a feature film. He explained, [...] "I would sit with Pete [...] and David Silverman and we would talk about a scene and they would tell me what they were looking for. I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. We'd get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Here's where the collaborative process really <b>kicked</b> in. The <b>board</b> artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes, I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further." ...|$|R
50|$|That day, before {{playing the}} match, the Uruguayans celebrated their Olympic title by circumvalating the field, {{something}} described then as la vuelta de los olímpicos (the {{round of the}} Olympic ones), lately just vuelta olímpica (Olympic round). Argentina won that match 2-1 (Onzari 1-0 at 15’, Cea 1-1 at 29’, and Tarasconi 2-1 at 53’), but it was Onzari’s goal {{which was to be}} remembered, because it was converted directly from a corner <b>kick.</b> The International <b>Board</b> had specifically modified the football rules on this point on June 14, 1924, allowing goals to be scored like that. Since then, a goal like Onzari’s is referred as a Gol olímpico or Olympic goal in almost all Latin America, and even some parts of Europe. It {{is the first time that}} an Olympic goal is called that way, and is also the debut of the expression vuelta olímpica in Latin America. Onzari was at that moment playing for Huracán.|$|R
60|$|I deserted {{the cool}} shade, {{put on a}} {{swimming}} suit, and got hold of a surf-board. It was too small a board. But I didn't know, and nobody told me. I joined some little Kanaka boys in shallow water, where the breakers were well spent and small--a regular kindergarten school. I watched the little Kanaka boys. When a likely-looking breaker came along, they flopped upon their stomachs on their <b>boards,</b> <b>kicked</b> like mad with their feet, and rode the breaker in to the beach. I tried to emulate them. I watched them, tried to do everything that they did, and failed utterly. The breaker swept past, and I was not on it. I tried again and again. I kicked twice as madly as they did, and failed. Half a dozen would be around. We would all leap on our boards {{in front of a}} good breaker. Away our feet would churn like the stern-wheels of river steamboats, and away the little rascals would scoot while I remained in disgrace behind.|$|R
5000|$|Gerson {{described}} {{writing his}} first film, Monsters, Inc., {{as a highly}} collaborative process: [...] "I would sit with Pete Docter and David Silverman directors, and we would talk about a scene and they would {{tell me what they}} were looking for. I would make some suggestions and then go off and write the sequence. We'd get together again and review it and then hand it off to a story artist. Here's where the collaborative process really <b>kicked</b> in. The <b>board</b> artist was not beholden to my work and could take liberties here and there. Sometimes, I would suggest an idea about making the joke work better visually. Once the scene moved on to animation, the animators would plus the material even further." [...] Andrew Stanton credited him as having rewritten and improved Monsters, Inc. after he was unable to continue with the project: [...] "I’ve never written anything that I felt was improvable, and Dan Gerson was the guy who came in after I left and kept running with it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Bridget-as-Siobhan asks Henry {{to avoid}} her, {{and in the}} process, tells him about a recent {{phone call from a}} doctor telling her she's pregnant. Juliet, meanwhile, acts out to her father but is assured by him about him and Siobhan loving her. He later informs Siobhan (who is really Bridget) that Juliet got <b>kicked</b> out of <b>Boarding</b> School for doing drugs. Gemma calls Bridget and tells her that she thinks she knows who Henry is having an affair with and tells her to go to the loft. Upon arriving, she finds a man with a crowbar and tries to avoid him (this is where the episode starts). However she is seen by him and he tries to choke her. She manages to avoid him, and upon seeing the {{newspaper}} where she hid the gun, goes to it, takes the gun and shoots the man - while shouting, [...] "I'm not Bridget!" [...] When he dies, she checks his pockets and finds a picture with the words [...] "Siobhan Martin" [...] in the back. The final scene is in Paris, where Siobhan (now revealed to be alive) is called by a man who says, [...] "We have a problem." ...|$|R
50|$|When World War II {{sweeps the}} world, Darcy is sent {{overseas}} and offers Maggy to elope before leaving, but she rejects the idea. Kate moves {{into a house}} in Connecticut and tries to convince Mistral and Avigdor to join her, but Mistral does not see any danger and is only invested with painting; while Avigdor - who is Jewish - cannot leave his sick mother behind. Paula joins the resistance and promises to help Avigdor cross the border, but she is caught by the Nazis before she can. Nazi officer Schmidt (Wolf Kahler), who sympathizes with Mistral's work and therefore allows him {{to continue to work}} - catches portraits from Avigdor in Mistral's residence, and warns him not to help Jews.

50|$|A {{little over}} a year ago two deputy marshals and Isbel with a posse of five men {{surrounded}} his Christie's house just before daylight one morning and found him at home to their sorrow. They demanded his surrender and informed him that if he proposed to resist he had best send his family out as they intended to have him if they had to burn down the house. He answered them with a defiant yell, and they heard him ascending to the attic of the building, which was one story and built of logs, the gable ends only being weather boarded. Getting into the loft he <b>kicked</b> off a <b>board</b> and opened fire on the party, which they returned from every direction, each man having 'taken a tree.' Firing was kept up at intervals for some time without effect but finally one of the marshals Isbel exposed his shoulder and quick as a flash a Winchester ball went crashing through it, inflicting a wound that will make a cripple of the victim for life. This enraged the officers and they set fire to an outhouse hoping to scare out their game without burning the main building. In the meantime Christie's wife and son {{came out of the house}} and ran off, the boy being fired upon and wounded as he escaped into the brush. The outhouse burned rapidly and lit up the scene, soon spreading to the dwelling but the desperate Indian still held his fort house and answered the demands of the officers with shots and yells of defiance. By the time it was day light and the marshals fearing that Christie's wife had gone for help, and knowing that he had many relatives in the neighborhood, and it being apparent that he would die in the burning house before he would surrender if he had not already been shot, took their wounded comrade and retreated to where they had left their horses tied in the woods making their way to Tahlequah the same day. They afterwards learned that Christie was still in the burning building when they left and was wounded in the head but made his escape.|$|R
6000|$|Lying in that {{steaming}} brown fragrant liquid, old Heythorp {{heaved a}} stertorous sigh. By losing his temper with that ill-conditioned cur he had cooked his goose. It {{was done to}} a turn; {{and he was a}} ruined man. If only--oh! if only he could have seized the fellow by the neck and pitched him out of the room! To have lived to be so spoken to; to have been unable to lift hand or foot, hardly even his voice--he would sooner have been dead! Yes--sooner have been dead! A dumb and measureless commotion was still at work in the recesses of that thick old body, silver-brown in the dark water, whose steam he drew deep into his wheezing lungs, as though for spiritual relief. To be beaten by a cur like that! To have that common cad of a pettifogging lawyer drag him down and kick him about; tumble a name which had stood high, in the dust! The fellow had the power to make him a byword and a beggar! It was incredible! But it was a fact. And to-morrow he would begin to do it--perhaps had begun already. His tree had come down with a crash! Eighty years-eighty good years! He regretted none of them-regretted nothing; least of all this breach of trust which had provided for his grandchildren--one of the best things he had ever done. The fellow was a cowardly hound, too! The way he had snatched the bell-pull out of his reach-despicable cur! And a chap like that was to put [...] "paid" [...] to the account of Sylvanus Heythorp, to [...] "scratch" [...] him out of life--so near the end of everything, the very end! His hand raised above the surface fell back on his stomach through the dark water, and a bubble or two rose. Not so fast--not so fast! He had but to slip down a foot, let the water close over his head, and [...] "Good-bye" [...] to Master Ventnor's triumph Dead men could not be <b>kicked</b> off the <b>Boards</b> of Companies. Dead men could not be beggared, deprived of their independence. He smiled and stirred a little in the bath till the water reached the white hairs on his lower lip. It smelt nice! And he took a long sniff: He had had a good life, a good life! And with the thought that he had it in his power at any moment to put Master Ventnor's nose out of joint--to beat the beggar after all, a sense of assuagement and well-being crept over him. His blood ran more evenly again. He closed his eyes. They talked about an after-life--people like that holy woman. Gammon! You went to sleep--a long sleep; no dreams. A nap after dinner! Dinner! His tongue sought his palate! Yes! he could eat a good dinner! That dog hadn't put him off his stroke! The best dinner he had ever eaten was the one he gave to Jack Herring, Chichester, Thornworthy, Nick Treffry and Jolyon Forsyte at Pole's. Good Lord! In 'sixty--yes--'sixty-five? Just before {{he fell in love with}} Alice Larne--ten years before he came to Liverpool. That was a dinner! Cost twenty-four pounds for the six of them--and Forsyte an absurdly moderate fellow. Only Nick Treff'ry and himself had been three-bottle men! Dead! Every jack man of them. And suddenly he thought: 'My name's a good one--I was never down before--never beaten!' ...|$|R
