25|$|The Addams Family {{television}} series began after David Levy, a television producer, approached Addams {{with an offer}} to create <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> help from the humorist. All Addams {{had to do was}} give his characters names and more characteristics for the actors to use in portrayals. The series ran on ABC for two seasons, from 1964 to 1966.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Animate, Kurosaki related her experiences in writing the song [...] "Memories Last". She mentioned how, after reading the A Certain Magical Index books, she sympathized with the character Accelerator and imagined his feelings as she wrote the song. She describes Accelerator is a character who initially has a lonely personality but gains kindness after meeting the character Last Order, and she wrote the song's lyrics based on his personality. She describes the song as an emotional song, and she originally sang <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> pain.|$|E
500|$|... "For me, it's {{really easy}} to write {{depressive}} songs and that's why I never do that. I {{try to do}} songs that are a bit happier and a bit more complicated. I think {{there are too many}} songwriters writing sad, depressive songs, and I find it really boring, listening to music where people are just complaining. People should stop whining! I find it much more challenging to make songs that are pop songs, to make happy songs, and that's why I like to do it. I really like to make quite hopeful, happy music {{with a little bit of}} melancholy in <b>it,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> spice of melancholy." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{rose from}} his seat and threw a bank-note over the table. The clerk opened it and handed <b>it</b> back <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> start.|$|R
60|$|The {{newspaper}} {{man took}} a hurried leave. Van Teyl seized the telephone receiver, only to put <b>it</b> down <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> shout of relief {{as the door}} opened and Lutchester entered.|$|R
500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a number of}} other cultural references. When Peter and Lois enter their motel room and find a hooker on the bed, Peter warns Lois to stay perfectly still, as the prostitute's vision is based on movement. This is a reference to a scene in the movie Jurassic Park (1993) in which Dr. Grant gives this warning in reference to a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Pinocchio appears in a cutaway gag, in which Gepetto bends over and deliberately sets Pinocchio up to tell a lie in an attempt to emulate anal sex. This was based on a joke MacFarlane's mother had told her friends when he was a child. Lois yells out George Clooney's name when she and Peter are having sex. The 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners is also referenced when a fictional episode of the sitcom is shown in which Ralph Kramden, the show's main character, hits his wife, Alice, something he would only threaten to do on the show. Meg watches an episode of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, which shows three men in a living room, one of whom is cut in half at the waist and screaming in agony, the other two standing over him and screaming in horror. Fictional army soldier Flint of [...] appears briefly after Chris is caught drinking vodka, and educates the children on drinking and informs them that [...] "...knowing is half the battle". Flint's voice was provided by Bill Ratner, the actor who had voiced the character in the G.I. Joe television series. According to Seth Green, who voices Chris, the reason the Family Guy cast members did not voice Flint themselves is because if you have the original actor providing the voice [...] "you take <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bit more gravitas".|$|E
2500|$|He {{said that}} he would safely and conscientiously trust him with a {{considerable}} trust in government, but I think he said <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> hesitation. It is clear that he is not quite at ease about him, tho' as far as I can see determined not to abandon him. ... The combat in his mind between the candid interpretation of his friend's actions, and his own conviction deprives him of half the benefit of his understanding.|$|E
2500|$|... "Every {{episode is}} not a {{biography}} of my life, it is simply based on my life experiences. It is an accurate portrayal {{of my life and}} the people who share <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> Hollywood magic thrown in," [...] DuBois has said. She does state in both her book and in the edition of January 3, 2005 of Sci Fi Weekly that the program closely resembles the truth of her own life. Several details of Arquette's character match DuBois's life, such as the name of her husband on the show (Joe) {{and the fact that he}} is an aerospace engineer. [...] Both the character and the real-life Dubois have three daughters, and the first case the character [...] "consults" [...] on in the show's pilot is with the Texas Rangers, the law enforcement agency with whom the real-life DuBois alleges she first worked.|$|E
60|$|He {{threw back}} his head and the {{contents}} of his glass vanished. He set <b>it</b> down <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> smack of the lips. Once more he looked at the bottle. Frenhofer filled up his glass, but motioned to the door with his head.|$|R
60|$|She {{flung it}} up, it fell safely. But her father's brow knitted slightly. She tossed it wildly: <b>it</b> fell <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> {{splashing}} explosion: <b>it</b> had smashed. It {{had fallen on}} the sharp edge of the tiles that protruded under the fender.|$|R
60|$|But {{there was}} {{something}} wrapped up in it. Oh, yes! There {{was a pair of}} braces wrapped up in <b>it,</b> braces <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> steel sliding thing so that you could slide your pants up to your neck, if you wanted to.|$|R
2500|$|While hosting Tubridy Tonight, {{he spoke}} of the public's {{perception}} of him, saying: [...] "I think I am a victim of my own image. I think it's been cultivated by others for me. I live in a very ordinary semi-detached house. People only ever see me on a Saturday night on TV and I'm in a smart suit with a book-lined backdrop so that's what they think – you're Johnny smart suit with a book-lined backdrop." [...] Referring to the type of woman he would like, Tubridy said: [...] "I like intelligence, I like a good conversation. I like elegance, I like a girl who is feminine without being vain, I like a little retro in terms of fashion and look and sprinkle <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sense of humour. I also love a girl who appreciates darkness. I'm a lot darker than people think – plenty of dark humour." ...|$|E
2500|$|As with Lewis's debut album, Spirit, each of Echos {{producers}} were enlisted by her mentors Simon Cowell and Clive Davis. Unlike {{her debut}} album where she travelled between cities, Lewis remained in Los Angeles for {{the recording of}} Echo, which took nine months to produce. It contains ballads, racier tracks and dancefloor anthems. Lewis titled the album Echo [...] "since an echo describes a big, organic sound," [...] and it appealed to her love of fantasy as Echo was a nymph who, in Greek mythology, [...] "pined away till only her voice remained." [...] In August 2009 Lewis told her official website: [...] "I'm {{in the midst of}} the recording process, working with incredible songwriters and producers, and my music has really evolved. It's so exciting to create something new." [...] She also said, [...] "I'm actually more confident with this album than the last. I've taken more control this time and I feel more at ease with everything." [...] She told Variety magazine that she [...] "wanted the album to have a little bit more of a live feel to <b>it,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more live instrumentation," [...] and described Echo as [...] "more guitar-driven" [...] compared to Spirit, with a [...] "harder edge" [...] in an interview with Seventeen.|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{commented on}} the musical style of her debut album {{describing}} the album as [...] "classic songs with a contemporary edge", with R and [...] "fresh pop" [...] styles, ballads and [...] "soulful up-tempo numbers". It has an American style, with some electronic 1980s sounds. However, the songs are not beat-driven or following the latest trends but can be performed acoustically. Lewis's second album, [...] "Echo", mixed pop and R during an interview with Variety magazine, she said on the album's sound that she [...] "wanted the album {{to have a little}} bit more of a live feel to <b>it,</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> more live instrumentation." [...] In February 2011, talking about her third studio album [...] "Glassheart", Lewis said that the album would be more experimental than Spirit and Echo by embodying a [...] "different" [...] yet [...] "classic" [...] sound. She added, [...] "I'm really, really excited about it. I'm working with some new producers, some up and coming people and it's going to be kind of a different sound – but still classic". Lewis described it as [...] "energetic, deep, [...] unique". She also commented that it would have a darker tone and that she would be putting her [...] "heart into [...] lyrics".|$|E
60|$|Still no reply! Quest drew a chair up to {{the window}} and sat there with folded arms looking down into the street. Suddenly he sprang to his feet. The {{instrument}} quivered--there was a message at last! He took <b>it</b> down <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> choke of relief.|$|R

60|$|Colonel Parsons sat by {{the window}} in the dining-room to catch the last glimmer of the fading day, looking through his Standard {{to make sure that he}} had {{overlooked}} no part of <b>it.</b> Finally, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> sigh, he folded it up, and taking off his spectacles, put them in their case.|$|R
60|$|He {{opened a}} packet, and laid <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> silver flask upon her knee.|$|E
60|$|Singleton {{had taken}} the {{photograph}} and was poring over <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> murmur of delight.|$|E
60|$|He {{pulled a}} small leather purse {{out of his}} coat pocket, and laid <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bang on the table.|$|E
60|$|He {{took it out}} {{and handed}} <b>it</b> to her, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> smile which he could not help, though he rather blamed himself for indulging in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "Father," [...] she said, {{smiling in}} his wistful face, [...] "we have seen more troubled waters than these, far, {{and in a}} much frailer vessel. Do you not {{remember}} the Wallenstadt and its miserable skiff? where I have heard you say there was really danger, though we escaped from <b>it</b> all <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> fright." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'See here, then,' said Squeers, {{accompanying}} {{his remarks}} with appropriate action, 'I fill the {{glass from the}} bottle, and I say [...] "Your health, Slider," [...] and empty it; then I rinse <b>it</b> genteelly <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> drop, which I'm forced to throw into the fire--hallo! we shall have the chimbley alight next--fill it again, and hand it over to you.' ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then she}} lifted it up, and {{afterwards}} dropped <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> look of pain {{that ran through}} his heart.|$|E
60|$|Quest hastily {{laid down}} his spoon, raised {{the cup of}} bouillon and {{presented}} <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bow to his neighbour.|$|E
60|$|He drew a {{card from}} a small gold case, and {{presented}} it to Duncombe, who accepted <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> bow.|$|E
5000|$|Gridlock'd is a 1997 American crime black comedy-drama film {{written and}} {{directed}} by Vondie Curtis-Hall and starring Tupac Shakur, Tim Roth, Lucy Liu, and Thandie Newton. It was the directorial debut of Curtis-Hall, who also has a small role in the film. The film's opening was relatively low, despite critical acclaim; its opening weekend netted only $2,678,372 and <b>it</b> finished <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> over $5.5 million.|$|R
60|$|Night came, and <b>with</b> <b>it</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> peace. The tumult {{with which}} the town was filled quietened down; {{one by one the}} sounds ceased, and over the city fell a troubled sleep....|$|R
5000|$|... "This one was {{recorded}} in my little submarine. I nicked a bit of my own 'Electric Shock' track, and stuck <b>it</b> in here, <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> delay over the top. Came out quite well, don't you think?." ...|$|R
60|$|He {{clutched}} at her sled, {{and even in}} the midst of her anger she noticed <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> thrill of pleasure.|$|E
6000|$|... "What a horrible-looking man!" [...] said Billie, {{breaking}} <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> gasp. Jno. Peters often {{affected the}} opposite sex like that at first sight.|$|E
60|$|He fell in {{with her}} mood, and their {{conversation}} touched only upon the game. On the last green he suffered defeat and acknowledged <b>it</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> grimace.|$|E
6000|$|He {{threw down}} the book {{presently}} and got up, {{standing before the}} fire with his hands behind him. [...] "Well, I hold that it lies in your hands. I shall leave <b>it</b> there. <b>With</b> <b>a</b> <b>little</b> good-will you may manage it. Think that over and remember how much I count on you." [...] He waited <b>a</b> <b>little,</b> to give her time to answer; but she answered nothing, and he presently strolled out of the room.|$|R
6000|$|Suddenly Lane buttonholed {{the little}} man and peered down earnestly at him. [...] "Pepper, I've been trying to {{straighten}} Holt up. He's going to the bad. But he's a good kid. It's only the company.... The fact is--this's strictly confidential, mind you--Holt's sister begged {{me to try to}} stop his drinking and gambling.
