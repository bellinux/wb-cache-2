40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{investigate}} <b>insider</b> <b>trades</b> on Oslo Børs. More specifically, w e explore the market reaction to in sider trades, the abnormal returns earned by insiders {{in the long}} run, and finally we investigate whether outsiders can earn money by mimicking <b>insider</b> <b>trades.</b> Our analy sis is conducted for the period 01. 01. 2010 – 26. 09. 2014. Using an event study approach, we document a strong initial market reaction to <b>insider</b> <b>trades,</b> particularly <b>insider</b> <b>trades</b> made by managers and directors, and <b>insider</b> <b>trades</b> in firms with recent financial distress. We also find some evidence of long term abnormal returns for insiders i n certain firm categories, and for certain types of insiders. Finally, we develop an insider portfolio that outperforms the benchmark using standard performance measurements, {{but we do not}} find any significant alphas. We conclude that there are information al asymmetries between outsiders and insiders, and that the market does not hold strong - form efficiency. Our study has implications for those who seeking to earn abnormal returns by following insider based strategies. nhhma...|$|R
40|$|Prior {{research}} provides {{evidence that}} insiders generate significant abnormal returns by trading on private information. We use the cross sectional variations of insidersÆ ability to trade opportunistically to gauge managerial opportunism {{at the company}} level. Using U.

We first show companies with higher degrees of opportunistic <b>insider</b> <b>trade</b> have (1) worse future earnings performance and (2) lower market valuation contemporaneously (TobinÆs Q). This seems to suggest OIT represents managerial opportunism. We also show OIT is incrementally useful {{as a proxy for}} managerial opportunism after considering two popular corporate governance indices (G-Index and Gov-Score). Next we investigate whether various forms of managerial opportunism are substitutes or complements. We find opportunistic <b>insider</b> <b>trade</b> is positively associated with two other forms of managerial opportunism earnings misstatements and illegal stock option backdating.

The 53-count, 65-page {{indictment}} covers {{a broad range of}} financial crimes, including bank fraud, making false statements to banks and auditors, securities fraud, wire fraud, money laundering, conspiracy, and <b>insider</b> <b>trading.</b> United States District Judge Sim Lake had previously denied motions by the defendants to have separate trials and to relocate the case out of Houston, where the defendants argued the negative publicity concerning Enron's demise would make it impossible to get a fair trial. On May 25, 2006, the jury in the Lay and Skilling trial returned its verdicts. Skilling was convicted of 19 of 28 counts of securities fraud and wire fraud and acquitted on the remaining nine, including charges of <b>insider</b> <b>trading.</b> He was sentenced to 24 years and 4 months in prison.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{emphasized}} a slow price adjustment to reported <b>insider</b> <b>trades</b> for Germany. The results {{presented in this}} paper, though, show that this is mainly caused by a subset of high arbitrage risk stocks. In fact, the abnormal return difference between the quintiles of stocks with highest and lowest idiosyncratic risk is {{in the range of}} 2. 99 - 4. 90 % over a 20 -day interval. These results are robust even {{in the context of a}} joint generalized least squares approach. By developing a simple zero-investment arbitrage <b>trading</b> strategy mimicking <b>insider</b> <b>trades,</b> it turns out that such a trading strategy, in most cases, generates significant positive returns as long as transaction costs are neglected. However, the outperformance disappears in all risk quintiles, if bid/ask spreads are taken into account. We conclude that the market's under-reaction to reported <b>insider</b> <b>trades</b> can mainly be explained by the cost of risky arbitrage and is therefore not exploitable.

5|$|On December 7, 1982, Kassar {{announced}} that Atari's revenue forecasts for 1982 were {{cut from a}} 50 percent increase over 1981, down to a 15 percent increase. Immediately following the announcement, Warner Communications' stock value dropped by around 35 percent—from US$54 to US$35—resulting in the company losing US$1.3billion in market valuation. Kassar sold five thousand of his Warner shares a half-hour before the announcement. This prompted an investigation for <b>insider</b> <b>trading</b> against him by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission. Atari attempted to regain their market share by licensing popular arcade games for the Atari consoles. The games, however, did not reverse Atari's decline and they went further into debt. In 1983, the company had decreased its workforce by 30 percent and lost US$356million. Other companies—Activision, Bally Manufacturing, and Mattel—experienced similar results as the industry declined.|$|E
40|$|We {{examine how}} {{financial}} statement informativeness, analyst following, and news {{relate to the}} information asymmetry between insiders and outsiders. Corporations' timely disclosures of value relevant information and information collection by outsiders reduce information asymmetry, limiting insiders' ability to trade profitably on private information. We use the profitability and intensity of <b>insider</b> <b>trades</b> to proxy for information asymmetry. We find that increased analyst following is associated with reduced profitability of <b>insider</b> <b>trades</b> and reduced <b>insider</b> purchases. Financial statement informativeness is negatively associated with the frequency of insider purchases. However, company news, good or bad, is positively associated with insider purchase frequency. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|Corresponding author. We {{analyze the}} long-run stock market {{performance}} of U. S. firms experiencing managerial insider transactions. Our sample {{starts with the}} enforcement of the corresponding Sarbanes-Oxley legislation change in August 2003 and consists of more than 176, 000 <b>insider</b> <b>trades</b> of all firms traded on NASDAQ, AMEX, and the NYSE. Our results reveal that insider buy transactions exhibit positive private information and precede shortrun and long-run abnormal returns. Surprisingly, insider sales do not contain negative private information. We document that companies with insider sale transactions earn significant positive Buy-and-Hold abnormal returns until the third anniversary after <b>insider</b> <b>trades.</b> Assuming that <b>insider</b> sale transactions are a proxy for equity-based compensation, this finding suggests that firms with equity-based compensation outperform firms without equity-based compensation...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Until October 2004 {{corporate}} insiders in Germany {{were required}} to report trades in the shares of their firm "without delay". In practice substantial reporting delays were common. We show that the delays are systematically related to {{the characteristics of the}} firm. Delays are longer in widely-held firms and in firms using German accounting standards. This suggests that managers of these firms are less responsive to the informational requirements of the capital market. We fur-ther find that abnormal returns after the reporting date of an <b>insider</b> <b>trade</b> are independent of the reporting delay. This implies that prices are distorted in the period between the trading and the re-porting date. This is a strong point in favor of regulation requiring and enforcing immediate disclo-sure of <b>insider</b> <b>trades.</b> JEL classification: G 14, G 30, G 3...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In the pre-Sarbanes-Oxley era {{corporate}} insiders {{were required}} to report trades in shares of their firm until the 10 th of the month following the trade. This gave them considerable flexibility to time their trades and reports strategically, e. g., by executing a sequence of trades and reporting them jointly after the last trade. We document that the reporting requirements were apparently not enforced. More than 13 % of the trades were reported too late. We further find clear evidence of strategic trading. Only 32. 1 % of the <b>insider</b> <b>trades</b> in our sample are classified as non-strategic. The probability of strate-gic trading depends on firm and trade characteristics and {{on the role of}} the insider in the firm. We per-form an event study where the event date is the date of the report. We find that the CARs do not de-crease in the length of the reporting delay. This implies that share prices are distorted by delayed report-ing. Thus, delayed reporting is detrimental to market efficiency. Finally, we find that the event study CARs are larger after the report of strategic <b>insider</b> <b>trades</b> as compared to otherwise similar non-strategic <b>insider</b> <b>trades.</b> Our results have important policy implications. In particular, they lend strong support to the more stringent trade reporting requirements established by the Sarbanes Oxley Act...|$|R
40|$|We revisit Kyle’s (Econometrica 53 : 1315 – 1335, 1985) {{model of}} price {{formation}} {{in the presence of}} private information. We begin by using Back’s (Rev Financ Stud 5 (3) : 387 – 409, 1992) approach, demonstrating that if standard assumptions are imposed, the model has a unique equilibrium solution and that the <b>insider’s</b> <b>trading</b> strategy has a martingale property. That in turn implies that the insider’s strategies are linear in total order flow. We also show that for arbitrary prior distributions, the <b>insider’s</b> <b>trading</b> strategy is uniquely determined by a Doob -transform that expresses the insider’s informational advantage. This allows us to reformulate the model so that Kyle’s liquidity parameter TeX is characterized by a Lagrange multiplier that is the marginal value or shadow price of information. Based on these findings, we can then interpret liquidity as the marginal value of information...|$|R
