40|$|Abstract Background Onychomycosis {{has a high}} prevalance among immunocompromised {{patients}} such as diabetics and hemodialysis patients. In {{the present}} study, we aimed to investigate the prevalence of onychomycosis among hemodialysis patients with and without diabetes mellitus, {{and to find out}} the factors likely {{to be associated with the}} development of onychomycosis among hemodialysis patients. Methods One hundred and nine hemodialysis patients were enrolled. Fifty-seven of hemodialysis patients had the diagnosis of diabetes mellitus. Nail scrapings were obtained from 76 patients who had <b>dystrophic</b> <b>nail</b> changes. Samples were examined with 20 % potassium hydroxide solution and all of the samples were inoculated on Saboraud's dextrose agar, potateus dextrose agar and mycobiotic agar. Diagnosis of onychomycosis was based on the presence of both positive clinical signs and positive potassium hydroxide test. Results Onychomycosis was diagnosed in 26. 6 % of hemodialysis patients. Diabetes mellitus was present in 68. 9 % of patients with onychomycosis. Toenail scraping cultures were reported to be positive in 19. 7 % of patients with <b>dystrophic</b> <b>nail</b> changes. Logistic regression analysis revealed that the presence of diabetes mellitus and the mean duration of hemodialysis were the significant predictors associated with the development of onychomycosis. Conclusion The prevalence of <b>dystrophic</b> <b>nail</b> changes and onychomycosis is increased among hemodialysis patients. The dialysis duration and the presence of diabetes mellitus are the independent risk factors associated with the development of onychomycosis in uraemic patients. </p...|$|R

Aim of this study was investigation of frequency of fungal agents in <b>dystrophic</b> <b>nails</b> of referring persons to mycology laboratory of Razi hospital in Tehran. This was a cross sectional study that was performed on 700 patients with <b>dystrophic</b> <b>nails</b> who were introduced to the laboratory. Sampling was carried out by non-probability and in access. Specimens were investigated by direct microscopic observation, culturing and if necessary complementary examinations. Relationship between variations deliberated by chi- square and fisher exact tests. Out of 700 introduced individuals with <b>dystrophic</b> <b>nails</b> 183 persons were contracted to onychomycosis, 104 (56. 8 %) female and 79 (43. 1 %) males and more of them (31. 1 %) in the range of 50 - 59 of age wise. most of contracted persons were house holding women with distal subungual onychomycosis form (60. 4 %). Yeasts with 110 cases (55. 8 %) and among them candida Albicans (42. 7 %) were the most common etiologic agents of onychomycosis that were more often isolated from finger nails. Dermatophytes with 53 cases (26. 9 %) were more often isolated from toe nails and tiichophyton interdigital with (39. 6 %) was the most common of them. 34 cases (17. 3 %) of saprophytic moulds and more often from toe nails were isolated and most common of them was aspergillus flavus. yeasts are most common causes of onychomycosis and more affection of house holding women to them probably is because of more contact of them t...|$|E

She was treated with systemic antibiotics for secondary bacterial infection several times without any clinical response. Physical examination showed an erythematous swelling on the first toe with an irregular 2. 5 cm ulcer with a raised edge that was infiltrating and destroying the toenail. {{the bottom of the}} ulcer was granular and partially covered with a crust (Fig. 1). Laboratory studies showed a strong positive Montenegro intradermal reaction (2. 5 mm). Other intradermal reactions were also performed, such as purified protein derivative (PPD) and sporotrichin, which were negative. On X-ray examination of the left foot, bone destruction of the distal phalanx of the first toe and a soft tissue swelling were observed (Fig. 2). A biopsy was taken and the histologic picture showed a chronic inflammatory change with tuberculoid-type granuloma and necrosis suggesting leishmaniasis, although parasites were not observed. Based on the clinical, histologic, and immunologic aspects, we concluded that this was a case of leishmaniasis. Methylglucamine (Glucantime(R)) was introduced at a total dose of 17 g of the salt (10 mg/kg daily for 40 days).

OBJECTIVES: To analyze, through nail clipping, clinically normal and <b>dystrophic</b> <b>nails</b> of patients with cutaneous psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. METHODS: This is a cross-sectional multicenter study, conducted between August 2011 and March 2012. Patients were divided into four groups: patients with cutaneous psoriasis and onychodystrophy, patients with cutaneous psoriasis and clinically normal nails, patients with psoriatic arthritis and onychodystrophy and patients with psoriatic arthritis and clinically normal nails. We calculated NAPSI (Nail Psoriasis Severity Index) of the nail with more clinically noticeable change. After collection and preparation of the nail clipping, the following microscopic parameters were evaluated: thickness of the nail plate and subungual region, {{presence or absence of}} parakeratosis, serous lakes, blood, and fungi. RESULTS: There were more layers of parakeratosis (p= 0. 001) and a greater thickness of the subungual region in patients with cutaneous psoriasis and onychodystrophy (p= 0. 002). Serous lakes were also more present in the same group (p= 0. 008) and in patients with psoriatic arthritis and normal nails (p= 0. 047). The other microscopic parameters showed no significant difference between normal and <b>dystrophic</b> <b>nails</b> or between patients with psoriatic arthritis or cutaneous psoriasis.
