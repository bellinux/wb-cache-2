50|$|The XW had a {{displacement}} of 1,124 cc, with a bore of 72 mm and {{a stroke of}} 69 mm. It was initially powered by a single barrel carburettor, good for 57 PS (42 kW). A <b>double-barrel</b> <b>carburettor</b> version (XW 3S) raised power to 66 PS (48.5 kW). A detuned version with 50 PS (37 kW) was used in a few markets {{in place of the}} XV.|$|E
5000|$|The facelifted Corcel I (sometimes {{called the}} [...] "Mark 1½") arrived in 1973 {{and had a}} more {{aggressive}} look compared to the more conservative 1968 version. Some of the L and all GT versions were also equipped with a new, bored out 1.4-litre (1,372 cc) version of the existing engine. Claimed power for the regular Corcel was [...] (SAE gross), with [...] on tap at 5,400 rpm from the [...] "XP" [...] engine used in the GT, with its <b>double-barrel</b> <b>carburettor.</b> For SAE net, these figures became [...] and [...]|$|E
5000|$|Although a {{fastback}} coupé, Ford {{wanted the}} Capri Mk I to be affordable {{for a broad}} spectrum of potential buyers. To help achieve that, it was available with a variety of engines. The British and German factories produced different line-ups. The continental model used the Ford Taunus V4 engine in 1.3, 1.5 and 1.7 L engine displacements, while the British versions were powered by the Ford Kent straight-four in 1.3 and 1.6 L form. The Ford Essex V4 engine 2.0 L (British built) and Cologne V6 2.0 L (German built) served as initial range-toppers. At the end of the year, new sports versions were added: the 2300 GT in Germany, using a <b>double-barrel</b> <b>carburettor</b> with , and in September 1969 the 3000 GT in the UK, with the Essex V6, capable of [...]|$|E
5000|$|The 1351 cc L {{was usually}} {{labelled}} a [...] "1.3" [...] {{in spite of}} its displacement. It produced [...] with one or two <b>double-barrel</b> <b>carburettors.</b> It retained the 80 mm bore but used the 1500s 67.2 mm crankshaft.|$|R
5000|$|A {{variation}} on the Rekord C was the Rekord Sprint coupé (1967-71) with driving lights, sport steel wheels, sport stripes and a sporty interior; the Sprint received exclusively the so-called 1900 H engine with two <b>double-barrel</b> <b>carburettors,</b> good for [...] and 108 mi/h km/h.|$|R

5000|$|The first sport {{variant of}} the Visa {{included}} the [...] "Visa GT" [...] (1.4 L with <b>double-barrel</b> <b>carburettor</b> and 80 hp (59 kW) DIN), the [...] "Visa Chrono" [...] (93 hp (68 kW) from the 1.4 L engine, this time with two double-barrel carbs). The Visa [...] "Mille Pistes" [...] (naturally aspirated 112 hp (82 kW) and four-wheel drive) was the rare production version of Citroën's successful (if unlikely looking) Group B Visa rally car, the Visa Chrono and Chrono II. The Mille Pistes was built in 200 examples in 1983 and received its name after a Visa 4 x 4 competing in the experimental category won this rally in 1983, with Wambergue and Laverne driving. The evolution models were modified by Denis Mathiot; the displacement was increased to 1440 cc and the resulting power ranged from , with the weight down to 750 kg.|$|E

5000|$|Few {{alterations}} {{were made}} for 1960. The new models were refinements of the 1959 style with a much more restrained front end, {{the return of the}} double cone tail lights of 1958 rather than the startling [...] "cat's eyes" [...] of 1959. Under the hood, things remained constant. Fuel injection was no longer available, but with the 348 cubic inch engine, a horsepower rating of 335 at 5800 rpm was now achieved. This involved the use of three <b>double-barrel</b> <b>carburettors,</b> a special cam and an 11.25:1 compression ratio, all sold as a package.|$|R
25|$|The Alfetta saloon was {{launched}} in 1972, equipped with a 1.8-litre four-cylinder. It was a three-box, four-door notchback saloon (Berlina in Italian) with seating for five designed in-house by Centro Stile Alfa Romeo; the front end was characterised by twin equally sized headlamps connected to a central narrow Alfa Romeo shield by three chrome bars, while the tail lights were formed by three square elements. At the 1975 Brussels Motor Show Alfa Romeo introduced the , 108PS (DIN) Alfetta 1.6 base model, easily recognizable by its single, larger round front headlights. Meanwhile, the 1.8-litre Alfetta was rebadged Alfetta 1.8 and {{a few months later}} mildly restyled, further set apart from the 1.6 by a new grille with a wider central shield and horizontal chrome bars. Engines in both models were Alfa Romeo Twin Cams, with two overhead camshafts, 8-valves and two <b>double-barrel</b> <b>carburettors.</b> Two years later the 1.6 was upgraded to the exterior and interior features of the 1.8.|$|R
5000|$|The Autodelta-produced Giulietta 2.0 Turbo Autodelta (175 PS) was {{introduced}} at the 1982 Paris motor show. This special version had a turbocharged 1,962 cc engine. The production Giulietta Turbodelta version had [...] and a KKK turbocharger coupled with two <b>double-barrel</b> Weber <b>carburettors.</b> All turbo versions were black with red interior; only 361 were produced. In the same year, the Giulietta 2.0 Ti and turbodiesel (VM) 1995 cc version with [...] were also introduced, going {{on sale in}} early 1983.|$|R
2500|$|Little {{change was}} made for 1960. The new models were {{refinements}} of the 1959 style with a much more restrained front end, {{the return of the}} double cone tail lights of 1958 rather than the startling [...] "cat's eyes" [...] of 1959.

Body style offerings followed 1959, with hardtops and sedans available. [...] The convertible was reserved for the Impala series. [...] The Bel Air Sport Sedan continued to use a rear window overhang and a huge wraparound rear window. Bel Airs (and Biscaynes) had two tail lights per side; the Impalas had three tail lights per side—a situation that would persist for most years through 1975. Many of the same options and accessories that were available on the Impala were also available on the Bel Air. The Bel Airs had more interior and exterior brightwork than the Biscayne.|$|R
5000|$|A new 2637 cc {{version of}} the Cologne V6 engine {{assembled}} by Weslake and featuring their special all alloy cylinder heads appeared in September 1971, powering the Capri RS2600. This model used Kugelfischer fuel injection to raise power to [...] and {{was the basis for}} the Group 2 RS2600 used in the European Touring Car Championship. The RS2600 also received modified suspension, a close ratio gearbox, lightened bodywork panels, ventilated disc brakes and aluminium wheels. It could hit 100 km/h from a standstill in 7.7 seconds. The 2.6 L engine was detuned in September for the deluxe version 2600 GT, with 2550 cc and a <b>double-barrel</b> Solex <b>carburettor.</b> Germany's Dieter Glemser won the drivers' title in the 1971 European Touring Car Championship at the wheel of a Ford Köln entered RS2600 and fellow German Jochen Mass did likewise in 1972.|$|R
50|$|In 1970, two new {{variants}} were introduced. The {{estate was}} launched {{with the same}} trim levels and engines as in the saloon and a high performance Renault 12 Gordini model was introduced equipped with the all-aluminium 1565 cc block from the R16 TS fitted with two <b>double-barrel</b> Weber <b>carburettors</b> producing , a reinforced crankshaft, a five speed gearbox, ventilated disc brakes on the front wheels and normal disc brakes on the rear wheels, {{as well as a}} tuned suspension. The Gordini was able to reach 185 km/h and was sold with paint schemes comprising a solid pastel colour (there were several to choose from) with double white stripes added on, the most famous combination being French Blue with stripes. 2225 Renault 12 Gordinis were sold in 1971 but after that sales began a free fall. Renault stopped production of the Gordini in 1974 after 5188 had been sold (compared to 11,607 Renault 8 Gordinis).|$|R
