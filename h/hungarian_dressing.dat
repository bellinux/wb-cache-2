50|$|In {{consequence}} of the petition of the Jews of Pest, the mover of which was Dr. Philip Jacobovics, superintendent of the Jewish hospital, the general assembly of the county of Pest drafted instructions for the delegates on June 10, 1839, {{to the effect that}} if the Jews would be willing to adopt the Magyar language they should be given equal rights with other Hungarian citizens. From now on much attention was paid to the teaching of Hungarian in the schools; Moritz Bloch (Ballagi) translated the Pentateuch into Hungarian, and Moritz Rosenthal the Psalms and the Pirkei Avoth. Various communities founded Hungarian reading-circles; and the <b>Hungarian</b> <b>dress</b> and language were more and more adopted. Many communities began to use Hungarian on their seals and in their documents, and some liberal rabbis even began to preach in that language.|$|R

2500|$|Hungarian kings {{relied on}} the Cumans to {{counterbalance}} the growing independent power of the nobility Royal policy towards the Cumans was determined by their military and political importance. The Hungarian kings continuously hoped to use Cuman military support, {{the main reason for}} the invitation to settle and continued royal favors to them. The kings' main aim was to secure Cuman loyalty by various means, including intermarriage between the Cumans and the Hungarian royal family. Ladislaus IV [...] "the Cuman" [...] (whose mother was Queen Elizabeth the Cuman) was particularly fond of the Cumans and abandoned <b>Hungarian</b> culture and <b>dress</b> for Cuman culture, dress, and hairstyle (he lived with his Cuman entourage and concubines, who were Küpçeç, Mandola and Ayduva).|$|R
5000|$|The Bijelo Brdo {{culture or}} Bjelo-Brdo culture {{is an early}} medieval archaeological culture flourishing in the 10th and 11th centuries in Central Europe. It {{represents}} a synthesis of the culture introduced in the Carpathian Basin by the conquering Hungarians around 900 and of earlier cultures existing in the territory (in present-day Croatia, Hungary, Romania, Serbia and Slovakia) before the <b>Hungarian</b> conquest. Female <b>dress</b> accessories, including [...] "jewellery of plaited wire, two-piece sheetwork pendants, snake-head bracelets and S-shaped temple-reings" [...] (P. M. Barford), are the most characteristic items of the culture. The culture disappeared around 1100, most probably not independently of laws adopted under Kings Ladislaus I and Coloman of Hungary which prescribed the burial of dead in graveyards developed near churches.|$|R
40|$|If {{you have}} any Alberta connections, {{you will not be}} able to resist paging through this engaging, photo-full book looking for people and places you know. I found my {{grandfather}} on page 43, but still can 2 ̆ 7 t make out if my grandmothers are in the background of some of the other scenes. Most of Community Music in Alberta is given over to photographs of a stunning variety of music groups from the 1880 s to the present. Not only are there the fiddlers, dance bands, brass bands, pipers, CFCN and CKUA radio groups, cowboy singers (including Wilf Carter), powwow drums, little theater choruses, and others that we might expect, but also symphony orchestras, family groups, a <b>Hungarian</b> restaurant orchestra <b>dressed</b> in white cowboy hats for the Calgary Stampede, the Chieftains All-Indian band dressed in long black wigs for an unidentified festivity, a pair of violinists leading the Torah procession into a Calgary synagogue in the 1940 s, Chinese New Year parades, and a mandolin orchestra playing for a Communist gathering in a Crow’s nest Pass mining community, circa 1920. George Lyon, an enthusiastic folk musician the jacket photo shows him playing acoustic guitar has put together a wonderful volume that would be a delight were it only a coffee 235 table collection of photos and anecdotes. The brief text, however, is a sophisticated and effective essay that quickly revises all the clichés about both settler and indigenous musics in Alberta. Lyon begins by showing that the settlers brought music with them and that it was dearly appreciated. It was never a cultural fill to be added only after a family had 2 ̆ 2 made it. 2 ̆ 2 He deliberately structures the book so that Indians appear during the present, not as 2 ̆ 2 Vanishing 2 ̆ 2 peoples. He points out the structural similarities between things that seem different- the identical rhythm sections of polka, rock, and country bands-and the difference between things that sound similar-the uneven length of phrases differentiating Metis from Celtic fiddle styles even when the tunes are ostensibly the same. He also identifies astutely the ways that contemporary community musics, from fiddling contests to powwows, are both old and new, parts of vital cultures changing even while they retain older ways. 2 ̆ 2 Contest fiddling and chicken dancing have become complex displays of virtuoso competence which might have been inappropriate in older worlds. 2 ̆ 2 This is a thoroughly satisfying book. Now if there were only a way to produce a CD...|$|R
