Growing African nationalism and general dissent, particularly in Nyasaland, persuaded Britain to dissolve the Union in 1963, forming three separate divisions. While multiracial <b>democracy</b> <b>was</b> finally introduced to Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, however, Southern Rhodesians of European ancestry continued to enjoy minority rule.|$|E

5|$|The {{political}} struggle for <b>democracy</b> <b>was</b> solved outside Finland, via international power politics; the Russian Empire's failed 1904–1905 war against Japan {{led to the}} 1905 Revolution in Russia and to a general strike in Finland. In an attempt to quell the general unrest, the system of estates was abolished in the Parliamentary Reform of 1906, which introduced universal suffrage. The general strike increased support for the Social Democrats substantially, {{as a proportion of}} the population, the party was the most powerful socialist movement in the world.|$|E

5|$|According to polls {{conducted}} by mainstream media, most Japanese people had perceived {{the flag of}} Japan as the national flag even before {{the passage of the}} Law Regarding the National Flag and National Anthem in 1999. Despite this, controversies surrounding the use of the flag in school events or media still remain. For example, liberal newspapers such as Asahi Shimbun and Mainichi Shimbun often feature articles critical of the flag of Japan, reflecting their readerships' political spectrum. To other Japanese, the flag represents the time where <b>democracy</b> <b>was</b> suppressed when Japan was an empire.|$|E
5|$|After Athens' {{defeat in}} the Peloponnesian War, Thrasybulus led the {{democratic}} resistance to the new oligarchic government, known as the Thirty Tyrants, which the victorious Spartans imposed on Athens. In 404 BC, he commanded a small force of exiles that invaded the Spartan-ruled Attica and, in successive battles, defeated first a Spartan garrison and then {{the forces of the}} oligarchy. In the wake of these victories, <b>democracy</b> <b>was</b> re-established at Athens. As a leader of this revived democracy in the 4th century BC, Thrasybulus advocated a policy of resistance to Sparta and sought to restore Athens' imperial power. He was killed in 388 BC while leading an Athenian naval force during the Corinthian War.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{used the}} Ministry of Information's electoral {{education}} campaign as a partisan political tool. Instead of using it purely {{to explain the}} democratic process, the campaign was used to extol Diệm and his allies. After explaining what <b>democracy</b> <b>was,</b> a pamphlet outlined why Deposing a chief-of-state is a vital act. After elaborating on {{the powers of the}} head of state, the pamphlet went on to champion Diệm as an anti-communist who could defend people's freedom, while explaining why Bảo Đại was unfit to lead, saying {{that he did not have}} respect among the international community.|$|E
50|$|Plato {{rejected}} Athenian democracy on {{the basis}} that such <b>democracies</b> <b>were</b> anarchic societies without internal unity, that they followed citizens' impulses rather than pursuing the common good, that <b>democracies</b> <b>are</b> unable to allow a sufficient number of their citizens to have their voices heard, and that such <b>democracies</b> <b>were</b> typically run by fools. Plato attacked Athenian democracies for mistaking anarchy for freedom. The lack of coherent unity in Athenian democracy made Plato conclude that such <b>democracies</b> <b>were</b> a mere collection of individuals occupying a common space rather than a form of political organization.|$|R
50|$|<b>Democracies</b> <b>are</b> {{characterized}} as secular or religious. The definition of <b>democracy</b> <b>is</b> disputed and interpreted differently amongst politicians and scholars.

5|$|Plymouth Colony did {{not have}} a royal charter authorizing it to form a government, yet some means of {{governance}} was needed. The Mayflower Compact was the colony's first governing document, signed by the 41 able-bodied Separatists aboard the Mayflower upon their arrival in Provincetown Harbor on November 21, 1620. Formal laws were not codified until 1636. The colony's laws were based on a hybrid of English common law and religious law as laid out in the Bible. The colonial authorities were deeply influenced by Calvinist theology, and were convinced that <b>democracy</b> <b>was</b> the form of government mandated by God.|$|E
5|$|In ancient Athens, the Athenian <b>democracy</b> <b>was</b> {{restored}} {{on three}} separate occasions following the initial {{conquest of the}} city by Antipater in 322BC. When it fell repeatedly under Macedonian rule it was governed by a Macedonian-imposed oligarchy composed of the wealthiest members of the city-state. Other city-states were handled quite differently and were allowed {{a greater degree of}} autonomy. After PhilipII conquered Amphipolis in 357BC, the city was allowed to retain its democracy, including its constitution, popular assembly, city council (boule), and yearly elections for new officials, but a Macedonian garrison was housed within the city walls along with a Macedonian royal commissioner (epistates) to monitor the city's political affairs. Philippi, the city founded by PhilipII, was the only other city in the Macedonian commonwealth that had a democratic government with popular assemblies, since the assembly (ecclesia) of Thessaloniki seems to have had only a passive function in practice. Some cities also maintained their own municipal revenues. The Macedonian king and central government administered the revenues generated by temples and priesthoods.|$|E
5|$|Sihanouk, who by now had {{tired of}} the {{political}} squabbling, dissolved the assembly in September 1949, but opted to rule by decree {{for the next two}} years before general elections were held, which the Democrats won. In October 1951 Thanh returned to Cambodia and was received by 100,000 supporters, a spectacle which Sihanouk saw as an affront to his regal authority. Thanh disappeared six months later, presumably to join the Khmer Issarak. Sihanouk ordered the Democrat-led government to arrest Thanh but was ignored. Subsequently, civil demonstrations rallying against the monarchy and the French broke out in the countryside, alarming Sihanouk, who began to suspect that the Democrats had played a complicit role in them. In June 1952 Sihanouk dismissed the Democrat nominee Huy Kanthoul and made himself prime minister. A few days later, Sihanouk privately confided in exasperation to the US chargé d'affaires, Thomas Gardiner Corcoran, that parliamentary <b>democracy</b> <b>was</b> unsuitable for Cambodia.|$|E

5|$|When the lex Hortensia {{was enacted}} into law, Rome {{theoretically}} became a democracy (insofar as the landowners were concerned, anyway). In reality, however, Rome remained an oligarchy, since the critical laws were still {{enacted by the}} Roman Senate. In effect, <b>democracy</b> <b>was</b> satisfied with the possession of power, but did not care to actually use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by foreign policy. While upwards of 300,000 citizens were eligible to vote, many of these individuals lived a great distance from Rome, and so calling them all together {{in a short period}} of time was impossible. The foreign affairs questions often required quick answers, and three-hundred senators were more capable of quick action than were thousands of electors. The questions were also more complex than were the questions of the earlier era, and the average citizen was not adequately informed as to these issues. The senators, in contrast, were usually quite experienced, and the fact that they had income sources that were independent of their political roles made it easier for them to involve themselves in policy questions over extended periods of time.|$|E

Some cities also maintained their own municipal revenues, although evidence is lacking as to whether this was derived from local taxation or grants from the royal court. The Macedonian king and central government otherwise sustained strict control over the finances administered by other cities, especially in regards to the revenues generated by temples and cultic priesthoods.|$|E
