40|$|Introduction: The Sodium Iodide Symporter (NIS) {{facilitates}} iodide accumulation in {{the thyroid}} and radioiodide imaging {{and treatment of}} thyroid disease. Studies have suggested that elevated levels of NIS expression in malignant breast tissue may facilitate diagnosis, imaging and treatment of breast cancer. Alternative approaches, such as Adenovirus-based NIS gene therapy is limited by vector immunogenicity and an inability to specifically target tumours. Mesenchymal Stem Cells (MSCs) may represent appropriate cellular vehicles {{as a result of}} their proven tumour tropism and immune privilege. The aim of this project was to determine the presence, relevance and regulation of native mammary NIS expression and to explore the potential of MSC -mediated NIS gene therapy of breast cancer. Methods: Expression of NIS, and putative regulators (Retinoic acid receptors (RAR), Estrogen receptor (ER), Phosphoinositide- 3 -kinase (PI 3 K), and Thyroid hormone receptors (THR)) were determined by Relative Quantitative-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RQ-PCR) in 100 breast tissue specimens that included 15 controls. In vitro the effects of individual and combined estradiol, retinoic acid (RA) and thyroxine stimulation on NIS expression was determined in breast cancer cell lines. MSCs were engineered to express NIS and characterised in terms of phenotype and persistence of NIS expression and function. The distribution of systemically injected MSC-NIS in non-invasive disease and labelled MSCs in metastatic murine breast cancer models was determined over time. Results: NIS gene expression levels were significantly higher in malignant tissue compared to normal but even higher in benign tissue. Significant positive correlations in gene expression suggested relationships between NIS and putative regulators: RAR[alpha], RAR[beta], ER[alpha] and THR[beta] which were confirmed by estradiol, RA and thyroxine stimulation of NIS expression in vitro. Combined stimulation with RA and thyroxine had a synergistic effect on NIS expression. MSCs were successfully engineered to express NIS with no significant impact on phenotype observed. A cytotoxic effect on adjacent breast cancer cells was also demonstrated using Iodide 131 in vitro. In animal models, initial <b>ectopic</b> <b>engraftment</b> was shown to deplete over time except in malignant tissue and tumour-targeted MSC tropism as well as successful delivery of transgene to tumour sites was observed. Conclusion: This thesis presents novel data on the presence and relevance of mammary NIS expression in human tissues. It also supports a regulatory role for estradiol and retinoic acid, and introduces the potential for thyroid hormones to stimulate mammary NIS expression. The phenotype and migratory behaviour of labelled and Ad 5 /CMV/NIS infected MSCs demonstrated here strongly support the potential of MSC-mediated NIS gene therapy of breast cance...|$|E
40|$|Our {{immune system}} is an {{effective}} line of defence against foreign, infectious material and also functions to eradicate transformed cells. T lymphocytes (T cells) are a vital component of the adaptive arm {{of the immune system}} that develop and mature in the thymus. The thymus is broadly compartmentalised into an outer cortex and inner medulla and is populated by developing T cells (thymocytes) together with thymic stromal cells (TSC) that include cells of mesenchymal, neural, myeloid and epithelial lineage; with the latter being the predominant cell type within the stromal compartment. Thymic epithelial cells (TEC) provide molecular cues that promote thymocyte maturation and in turn, receive essential signals from thymocytes that encourage their differentiation. It is in this specialised thymic microenvironment that stringent selection processes occur, to ensure that a functional yet self-tolerant repertoire of mature T cells exit into the periphery. Immune senescence occurs as we age {{and one of the most}} evident signs of this is the gradual contraction of the thymus organ, known as age-associated (chronic) thymic involution. The loss of functional thymus tissue in particular, the epithelial compartment, is a main feature and leads to an abnormal microenvironment unable to support proper thymocyte development. Other extrinsic factors may also exacerbate thymic involution, such as conditioning regimes (cytoreductive treatments) prior to hematopoietic stem cell transplants, chemotherapy and malnutrition. Ultimately these factors contribute to the overall demise of immune function, resulting in a diminished response to invading pathogens, increased incidence of autoimmunity and inadequate surveillance of malignant cells. Several strategies to regenerate peripheral T cells show promising results, however there is only a transient immune recovery with no current therapy available that rescues sustained TEC function. One approach would be to activate endogenous repair programmes to rejuvenate the involuted or damaged thymus. Recent studies have elucidated the presence of thymic epithelial progenitor cells (TEPC) mainly in the fetal thymus however the identity of adult TEPC remains enigmatic. In this project, we sought to identify and characterise potential adult TEPC candidates. We revealed that phenotypically immature cortical TEC (cTEC) contain hallmark features of epithelial SC. We initially optimised an enzymatic digestion protocol to enable complete dissociation of adult thymus tissue which released the maximum number of TEC for downstream phenotypic and functional analyses. TEC subsets were then extensively assessed for the expression of epithelial SC-associated markers. Interestingly, a subset of cTEC expressing low (lo) levels of major histocompatibility complex II (MHC II) (cTEClo) was found to be enriched with SC-associated cell surface antigens and gene transcripts. Label retention studies revealed that cTEClo were relatively quiescent and that label retaining cells were largely localised to the cortico-medullary junction; an anatomical location in which bipotent TEPC are presumed to reside. More importantly, cTEClo showed bipotent and multilineage potential when purified and reaggregated with supporting fetal thymic stroma for subsequent <b>ectopic</b> <b>engraftment.</b> Adult cTEClo could form epithelial networks and differentiate into medullary TEC (mTEC); including the mature mTEC lineage that expresses the autoimmune regulator (Aire) transcription factor. Using a novel 3 -dimensional (3 D) epithelial culture assay, we further demonstrate exclusive and enriched colony forming potential within adult cTEClo. Colonies could be serially passaged whilst retaining thymic identity in vitro and when returned back to in vivo reaggregate grafts. Collectively, these data identify, for the first time, adult TEPC function within cTEClo and a possible differentiation series, in which cortical progenitors generate the medullary lineages in a stepwise manner. The findings and assays developed here may help streamline future TEPC research, in order to harness their potential as therapeutic targets for thymus regeneration...|$|E
