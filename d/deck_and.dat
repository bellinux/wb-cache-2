Eight of these were also on the main <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> the other three served as chase guns on the upper deck, two at the bow and one aft.|$|E

5|$|The {{armament}} of the Hector-class ships {{was intended}} to be 32 smoothbore, muzzle-loading 68-pounder guns, 15 on each side on the main <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck. This was modified during Hectors construction to four rifled 110-pounder breech-loading guns mounted on the upper <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> twenty-four 68-pounders on the broadside. Valiant, due to the delays in her construction and a shortage of guns, never received any of these guns. The breech-loading guns were a new design from Armstrong and much was hoped for them. To partially alleviate their overweight condition the ships were not fully armed and only received four 110-pounders on the upper <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> twenty 68-pounders on the main deck behind armour. Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target, however, proved that the 110-pounder was inferior to the 68-pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863–64 caused the navy to withdraw the gun from service shortly afterwards.|$|E
5|$|After {{twenty minutes}} {{fighting}} both Victory and Temeraire, the Redoutable {{had been reduced}} to a floating wreck. Temeraire had also suffered heavily, damaged when Redoutables main mast fell onto her poop <b>deck,</b> <b>and</b> having had her own topmasts shot away. Informed that his ship was in danger of sinking, Lucas finally called for quarter to the Temeraire. Harvey sent a party across under the second lieutenant, John Wallace, to take charge of the ship.|$|E
5|$|At {{some point}} in the war, the main deck six-inch guns of the Devonshire-class ships were moved to the upper <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> given gun shields. Their casemates were plated over to improve {{seakeeping}} and the four 3-pounder guns displaced by the transfer were landed.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1915, {{the main}} deck 6-inch guns of the Monmouth-class ships {{were moved to}} the upper <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> given gun shields; their casemates were plated over to improve the ships' seakeeping. The 12-pounder guns {{displaced}} by the transfer were repositioned elsewhere. At {{some point in the}} war, three 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns were installed on the upper deck.|$|E
5|$|Besides common {{avionics}} {{and computer}} systems, the 757 shares its auxiliary power unit, electric power systems, flight <b>deck,</b> <b>and</b> hydraulic parts with the 767. Through operational commonality, 757 pilots can obtain a common type rating {{to fly the}} 767 and share the same seniority roster with pilots of either aircraft. This reduces costs for airlines that operate both twinjets.|$|E
5|$|During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4, Saratoga and Lexington {{were able}} to launch an airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday, 7 February 1932, without being detected. The two {{carriers}} were separated for Fleet Problem XIII which followed shortly afterward. Blue Fleet and Saratoga were tasked to attack Hawaii and the West Coast defended by Lexington and the Black Fleet. On 15 March, Lexington caught Saratoga with all of her planes still on <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> was ruled to have knocked out her flight <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> have badly damaged the carrier, which was subsequently judged sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet destroyers. Captain George W. Steele assumed command on 11 July 1932. While en route from San Diego to San Pedro, the ship briefly ran aground off Sunset Beach, California on 17 August. Captain Rufus F. Zogbaum, Jr. (son of the famous illustrator) relieved Steele, who was ordered to immediately retire, on 1 January 1933.|$|E

5|$|Longtime Quarter Horse breeder and racehorse owner Walter Merrick of Sayre, Oklahoma, bred Easy Jet {{from two}} future AQHA Hall of Fame members, Jet <b>Deck</b> <b>and</b> Thoroughbred mare Lena's Bar in 1967. His dam, or mother, Lena's Bar, had {{produced}} {{a small number}} of other offspring, but Easy Jet was her last; she died shortly after he was weaned, or removed from his mother's milk. Both of his parents were descended from Three Bars, who was the sire of Lena's Bar and the grandsire of Jet Deck's dam. Easy Jet is one of only two horses in the American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame to have both parents in the Hall of Fame; his two grandsires, Moon <b>Deck</b> <b>and</b> Three Bars, are also in the Hall of Fame.|$|E
5|$|On 31 March 1931, Lexington, {{which had}} been near Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, Cuba, was ordered to aid {{survivors}} of an earthquake that devastated Managua, Nicaragua. By the following day, the ship {{was close enough to}} launch aircraft carrying supplies and medical personnel to Managua. During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4, Lexington and Saratoga were able to launch a massive airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday, 7 February 1932 without being detected. The two carriers were separated for Fleet Problem XIII which followed shortly afterward. Lexington was assigned to Black Fleet, defending Hawaii and the West Coast against Blue Fleet and Saratoga. On 15 March, Lexington caught Saratoga with all of her planes still on <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> was ruled to have knocked out her flight <b>deck</b> <b>and</b> have badly damaged the carrier, which was subsequently ruled sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet destroyers shortly afterward.

5|$|The Director of Naval Construction, William Henry White, {{submitted}} three {{designs in}} early April 1892 and the smallest one was chosen on 11 April.
