40|$|We {{introduce}} a new notion of <b>embedding,</b> called minimumrelaxation ordinal <b>embedding,</b> parallel to the standard notion of minimum-distortion (metric) <b>embedding.</b> In an ordinal <b>embedding,</b> it is the relative order between pairs of distances, and not the distances themselves, that must be preserved as much as possible. The (multiplicative) relaxation of an ordinal <b>embedding</b> is the maximum ratio between two distances whose relative order is inverted by the <b>embedding.</b> We develop several worst-case bounds and approximation algorithms on ordinal <b>embedding.</b> In particular, we establish that ordinal <b>embedding</b> has many qualitative differences from metric <b>embedding,</b> and capture the ordinal behavior of ultrametrics and shortest-path metrics of unweighted trees. ...|$|R

40|$|Most of the {{existing}} graph <b>embedding</b> methods focus on nodes, which aim to output a vector representation for each node in the graph such that two nodes being "close" on the graph are close too in the low-dimensional space. Despite the success of <b>embedding</b> individual nodes for graph analytics, we notice that an important concept of <b>embedding</b> communities (i. e., groups of nodes) is missing. <b>Embedding</b> communities is useful, not only for supporting various community-level applications, but also to help preserve community structure in graph <b>embedding.</b> In fact, we see community <b>embedding</b> as providing a higher-order proximity to define the node closeness, whereas most of the popular graph <b>embedding</b> methods focus on first-order and/or second-order proximities. To learn the community <b>embedding,</b> we hinge upon the insight that community <b>embedding</b> and node <b>embedding</b> reinforce with each other. As a result, we propose ComEmbed, the first community <b>embedding</b> method, which jointly optimizes the community <b>embedding</b> and node <b>embedding</b> together. We evaluate ComEmbed on real-world data sets. We show it outperforms the state-of-the-art baselines in both tasks of node classification and community prediction.
