5|$|A chapel {{dedicated}} to St Catherine of Alexandria {{is known to}} have existed on the site since 1157, when the Prior of Durham agreed to allow Romanus de Hilton to appoint his own chaplain for the chapel, subject to the prior's approval. In return, de Hilton was to provide an annual contribution of 24sheaves of oats for every <b>draught</b> <b>ox</b> he owned, to the nearby monastery at Monkwearmouth, and was required to attend the mother church of St Peters for the feasts of the Nativity, Easter, Whitsuntide and Saints Peter and Paul. In 1322, there was a chantry {{dedicated to}} the Virgin Mary and there were three chantry priests in 1370.|$|E
50|$|On {{into the}} 1950s, the innkeeper {{was one of}} the few who still owned horses. Baptist, the farmhand (possibly the only one in the village in those days) at the {{homestead}} zur Krone, now given up as an agricultural concern but now restored as the municipality’s Heimathaus (local museum), rode and worked with a horse and a <b>draught</b> <b>ox,</b> while most small farmers did the same with their dairy cows.An Evangelical one-room school was built in 1913, after the Gothic Revival Catholic church had been built nearby in 1898 and 1899. The last Catholic school in the village dated only from the time after the First World War, indeed from 1928, well into Weimar times. Today there are no longer any schools in Kappel. The last one, which was run as an interdenominational primary school, was dissolved on 1 August 1971. The church, which today is Evangelical, served from 1688 to 1898 both Evangelicals and Catholics under a simultaneum. Before this time, it had long been the preserve of the Evangelicals. When the simultaneum was instituted by higher authorities, the minister moved to Würrich, which was wholly Evangelical, and ministered to his congregation from there.|$|E

50|$|Zebu {{are used}} as <b>draught</b> <b>oxen,</b> dairy cattle, {{as well as for}} {{byproducts}} such as hides, dung for fuel and manure, and bone for knife handles and the like.|$|R
50|$|The bordars and cottars did not {{own their}} <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> or horses. The Domesday Book showed that England {{comprised}} 12% freeholders, 35% serfs or villeins, 30% cotters and bordars, and 9% slaves.|$|R
5000|$|Towards {{the end of}} the siege, the {{garrison}} and townsfolk were living largely on their remaining <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> and horses (mainly in the form of [...] "chevril", a meat paste named after the commercial beef extract [...] "Bovril").|$|R
60|$|Food Suitable for the Stores of Travellers.--The most {{portable}} {{kind of food}} is, unquestionably, {{the flesh}} of cattle; for the beasts carry themselves. The <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> used in African and Australian explorations serve as a last resource, when all other food is wanting.|$|R
5000|$|Cattle {{of similar}} type were {{numerous}} in the Cotswold Hills and the Severn Valley of England {{as early as}} the 13th century. They were valued for their milk (used for Gloucester cheeses), for providing strong and docile <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> and finally for their beef.|$|R
50|$|The Romagnola was in {{the past}} {{primarily}} a draught breed, though raised also for meat; limited dairy use is also documented. In the years before and after the Second World War the progressive mechanisation of agriculture meant that demand for <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> disappeared. It is now raised only for meat.|$|R
5000|$|In 1613, an {{agreement}} sought {{to protect the}} Greenhow miners' rights: [...] "…there may be cottages erected for the miners and mineral workmen upon the said waste … and also for the keeping of <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> and horses {{for the maintenance of}} the mines, always leaving the tenants sufficient common".|$|R
50|$|The Podolica was in {{the past}} mainly kept for draught work; meat and milk {{production}} were secondary to this. After the Second World War the progressive mechanisation of agriculture meant that demand for <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> disappeared. The breed is now raised mainly for meat; in some areas it is also kept for milk.|$|R
50|$|In other circumstances, {{horned animals}} may be preferred, for example, {{to help the}} animal defend itself against predators, to allow the {{attachment}} of head yokes to <b>draught</b> <b>oxen,</b> to provide a hand-hold on smaller animals such as sheep, or for aesthetic reasons - in some breeds the retention of horns is required for showing.|$|R
2500|$|Leaving Fort Garry on June 15, 1840 were 1210 Red river carts, 620 hunters, 650 women, 360 {{boys and}} girls, 403 buffalo runners (horses), 655 cart horses, 586 <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> and 542 {{dogs in the}} hunting expedition. In three days they reached their {{rendezvous}} at Pembina [...] {{to the south and}} set up a tent city.|$|R
50|$|Miss Geyser also {{recalled}} {{that her father}} had been a very wealthy man and had several fine teams of <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> and a large herd of valuable cattle with him. She added that he had an estimated £800 in gold bars and a large sum in £5 notes inside a wooden cash box in the wagon.|$|R
50|$|Cows produce around 4,300 kg of milk {{per year}} (3.8% fat; 3.4% protein). They reach 128-130 cm in height and a weight of 5-600 kg, while the bulls may reach 138-145 cm and 850-950 kg. Both bulls and steers {{may be used}} for beef production. Steers {{formerly}} served as strong <b>draught</b> <b>oxen,</b> and were an important source of income for small farms.|$|R
50|$|For almost 40 years {{following}} this, Henry John Moberly {{worked for the}} Hudson's Bay Company, at various locations in the Canadian North-West, retiring from active service {{in the spring of}} 1894. From Red River carts, horses, <b>draught</b> <b>oxen,</b> dog trains, York Boats, canoes and pack mules, Moberly witnessed the change to the conveniences of modern civilization, wagon roads, railroads, steamboats, telegraphs, telephones and electric lights.|$|R
5000|$|After Potgieter's trek was {{attacked}} and plundered at Vegkop, Moroka II swiftly assisted him with <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> and a liberal provision of supplies. The Boer party was also assisted in {{returning to a}} refugee camp at Thaba 'Nchu, named [...] "Moroka's Hoek". The Boer leader held a war council with the Barolong chiefs, Moroka and Tauana, where a Boer-Barolong-Griqua allegiance was formed, which shortly routed Mzilikazi, who then founded the kingdom of Matabeleland.|$|R
25|$|Except in Natal, {{the war had}} stagnated. Other than {{a single}} attempt to storm Ladysmith, the Boers {{made no attempt to}} capture the besieged towns. In the Cape Midlands, the Boers did not exploit the British defeat at Stormberg, and were {{prevented}} from capturing the railway junction at Colesberg. In the dry summer, the grazing on the veld became parched, weakening the Boers' horses and <b>draught</b> <b>oxen,</b> and many Boer families joined their menfolk in the siege lines and laagers (encampments), fatally encumbering Cronje's army.|$|R
30|$|For each animal sampled, {{data were}} {{collected}} on age, sex and life stage (calf, cow, heifer, bull, steer, <b>draught</b> <b>oxen)</b> and total parity to date for all cows. Cattle have individual names, {{and the head of}} the household and his sons were able to recount the age and reproductive history of each animal with high accuracy as previously observed (Swift 1981). Information provided was confirmed by comparison with the age according to dentition (accurate to 5 years). No cattle were sampled in October 2011.|$|R

30|$|The reduced {{work output}} of draft oxen due to {{blackleg}} {{was an important}} loss for the mixed crop livestock farming system {{of the study area}} which was estimated based on the daily market price of traction services. Morbidity of <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> leads to reduced crop production through reduction in the area that can be cultivated and lowered yields due to inefficient land preparation and timing. Moreover, the reduced milk production due to blackleg could have high impact on the daily household income generation source of herders in study area.|$|R
40|$|Contagious Bovine Pleuropneumonia (CBPP) is {{a highly}} {{contagious}} disease that affects cattle throughout most of sub Saharan Africa. It {{is one of the}} most serious livestock diseases with greatest impacts in pastoralist areas. Up to 15 % of infected animals die: milk yields of infected cows drop by up to 90 %: meat production is reduced, and infected <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> are less able to work. Existing vaccines have side effects and give limited protection. Research is underway at the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) to develop a more effective vaccine...|$|R
5000|$|Aside {{from their}} {{reproductive}} duties, bulls {{are also used}} in certain sports, including bullfighting and bull riding. They are also incorporated into festivals and folk {{events such as the}} Running of the Bulls and were seen in ancient sports such as bull-leaping. Though less common than castrated males, bulls are used as <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> in some areas. [...] The once-popular sport of bull-baiting, in which a bull is attacked by specially bred and trained dogs (which {{came to be known as}} bulldogs), was banned in England by the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835.|$|R
50|$|Sussex cattle are a red {{breed of}} beef cattle from the Weald of Sussex, Surrey and Kent in south eastern England. Descended from the <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> long {{used on the}} Weald they were {{selectively}} bred from the late 18th century to form a modern beef breed which is now used in many countries around the world. They have a thin summer coat and many sweat glands, but grow a thick coat in winter, so they are suited to both hot summers and cold winters. They have a placid temperament but can be very stubborn.|$|R
60|$|The {{band with}} which our adventurers were now {{associated}} {{was composed of}} a motley crew of Red River half-breeds, out for the great spring buffalo hunt. It consisted of nearly 700 hunters, as many women, more than 400 children, and upwards of 1000 carts, with horses and <b>draught</b> <b>oxen,</b> besides about 700 buffalo-runners, or trained hunting-horses, and more than 500 dogs. These latter, although useless in the spring hunt, were, nevertheless, taken with them, fed, and cared for, because of their valuable qualities as draught animals for light sledges in winter.|$|R
40|$|Decreasing {{efficacy}} of the trypanocidal drugs and difficulties of sustaining tsetse fly control, strengthen the importance of trypanotolerant livestock and the enhancement of disease resistance as options for livestock production. Continued increase in urban demand for meat and milk in West Africa, recent expansion of the demand for locally produced commodities, and increase demand of <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> are influencing breed choices towards increased size and milk production. In order to assess the influence of these conflicting trends on farmers decisions, studies of changes in breed compositions and farmers priority traits for breeding decisions were undertaken in mid-West Africa...|$|R

In three days they reached their {{rendezvous}} at Pembina 60 mi {{to the south and}} set up a tent city.The carts were set up to form a solid defensive circle with forks facing out. Within the circle the tents were set up in rows on one side and, facing the tents, the animals on the other side. The animals are kept outside when deemed safe.|$|R
40|$|In Sub-Saharan Saharan Africa, {{rangeland}} {{is increasingly}} converted to cropland, creating diverse crop-livestock livestock practices in different environments. As these practices lead to highly adapted livestock production systems using resources that vary locally and seasonally, not much {{is known about}} their similarities and differences. We assessed different crop-livestock crop systems through 60 semistructured interviews in lowlands ( 2400 m. a. s. l) l) around the Rift Valley, Ethiopia. Average livestock numbers per household were higher in lowlands (43) and highlands (18), where access to communal grazing lands was possible. Cattle dominated at all sites, <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> numbers increased with available cropping land per household. All sites used crop residues as supplemental feed. Dung was used as manure in most households, as fuel is used only in higher regions. Our study showed that crop-livestock livestock practices and livestock numbers {{can be explained by}} altitude titude but also by the availability of private and communally used land. Further practices should include growing fodder legumes, crop rotations, and intercropping, which might support a reduced reduced-tillage system and reduce numbers of environmentally costly <b>draught</b> raught <b>oxen...</b>|$|R
30|$|At the {{national}} level, FMD slows economic growth by severely limiting trade opportunities (James and Rushton 2002). Heavy losses occur in small-scale mixed farming systems when outbreaks affect <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> during cropping season; FMD causes considerable losses of milk yield and weight among dairy and fattening stock, respectively. Milk {{is important in}} the diet of sub-Saharan pastoralists (Sadler et al. 2012). For example, for the Borena in southern Ethiopia and the Turkana in northwest Kenya, milk accounts for 55 % and 62 % of their diet, respectively (Cossins and Upton 1987). At household level, milk is particularly an important food for pastoralists' children (Coppock 1994;Fielding et al. 2000).|$|R
50|$|The Podolica is a {{breed of}} {{domestic}} cattle from southern Italy. It {{belongs to the}} Podolic group of grey cattle. It is raised in the regions of Abruzzo, Basilicata, Calabria, Campania, Molise and Puglia. It was formerly distributed throughout most of mainland Italy {{and as far as}} Istria, now part of Croatia, and where it is now regarded as a separate breed, Istrian cattle. The Podolica was in the past bred principally as a draught animal; with the mechanisation of agriculture following the Second World War demand for <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> disappeared, and the Podolica is now raised for meat and, to a lesser extent, for milk.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the history of}} the destruction of the sustainable crop-livestock systems of the high altitude areas of Bolivia. One result of this is the shortage of forage for livestock. One possible solution to the soil degradation on sloping lands is the establishment of live barriers with phalaris grass. The information available on the productivity and nutritive value of this species is summarized and it's value as a source of forage is calculated. Preliminary information on the requirements of <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> in the interandean valleys allows the calculation of anual requirements of Metabolizable Energy,. and it is concluded that live barriers together with other sources of forage have the potential to make an important contribution to livestock nutrition...|$|R
5000|$|A zebu ( [...] , [...] or Bos primigenius indicus or Bos indicus or Bos taurus indicus), {{sometimes}} {{known as}} indicine cattle or humped cattle, is a species or subspecies of domestic cattle {{originating in the}} Indian subcontinent. Zebu are characterised by a fatty hump on their shoulders, a large dewlap, and sometimes drooping ears. They are well adapted to withstanding high temperatures, and are farmed throughout the tropical countries, both as pure zebu and as hybrids with taurine cattle, the other main type of domestic cattle. Zebu are used as <b>draught</b> <b>oxen,</b> dairy cattle, and beef cattle, {{as well as for}} byproducts such as hides and dung for fuel and manure. In 1999, researchers at Texas A&M University successfully cloned a zebu.|$|R
40|$|Although the {{aetiology}} of bone pathologies in cattle {{is poorly}} documented, various deformations in the skeleton {{have been attributed}} to draught exploitation in the archaeozoological literature. This paper summarizes the results of an osteological study that was undertaken on the feet of modern <b>draught</b> <b>oxen.</b> This led to the definition of a series of draught-related anomalies. In an attempt to describe the pathologies in a more consistent and quantitative way, a scoring scale for each individual bone pathology was established. The developed method is applied to cattle remains from four Roman and one late medieval site. The distribution of the observed pathological indices (PIs) on the first phalanges is interpreted in terms of the age structure of the cattle populations, and the possible modes of cattle exploitation and meat consumption in various settlement types.

500|$|Following {{instructions}} from Ottawa, French finally agreed with Morris that the expedition would initially follow the trail, but then would steer {{away from the}} border and Sioux territory, and the mounted police finally left Dufferin on July 8, 1874. The 275-strong expedition was divided into six divisions, supported by 310 horses, 143 <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> and 187 Red River carts and wagons, in all stretching out [...] along the track. The force took two 9-pounder (4kg) guns and two mortars for additional protection, cattle for food, and mowing machines to make hay. French had negotiated that the expedition be accompanied by Henri Julien, a journalist whom the commissioner hoped would write a positive account of the new force. The expedition made slow time along the boundary trail, progressing only [...] a day at most. The police were already travelling under unpleasant and arduous conditions, made more difficult by the teamsters having little experience and their horses being unsuitable for draught work.|$|R
60|$|Three {{days after}} we {{relieved}} Mafeking I had the luck to catch one of Snyman's retreating guns rather easily, the only big gun {{that was taken}} at Mafeking. I came upon it unexpectedly with about twenty men, spotted a clump of brush four hundred yards ahead, galloped into it before the Boers realized the boldness of our game, shot all the <b>draught</b> <b>oxen</b> while they hesitated, and held them up until Chambers arrived on the scene. The incident got perhaps {{a disproportionate share of}} attention in the papers at home, because {{of the way in which}} Mafeking had been kept in focus. I was mentioned twice again in despatches before we rode across to join Roberts in Pretoria and see what we believed to be the end of the war. We were too late to go on up to Komatipoort, and had some rather blank and troublesome work on the north side of the town. That was indeed the end of the great war; the rest was a struggle with guerillas.|$|R
500|$|Throughout the period, light horse, or prickers, {{were used}} for {{scouting}} and reconnaissance; they also provided a defensive screen for marching armies.
