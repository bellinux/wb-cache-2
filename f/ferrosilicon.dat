5|$|Silicon carbide, {{dissolved}} in a {{basic oxygen furnace}} used for making steel, acts as a fuel. The additional energy liberated allows the furnace to process more scrap with the same charge of hot metal. It {{can also be used}} to raise tap temperatures and adjust the carbon and silicon content. Silicon carbide is cheaper than a combination of <b>ferrosilicon</b> and carbon, produces cleaner steel and lower emissions due to low levels of trace elements, has a low gas content, and does not lower the temperature of steel.|$|E
25|$|Elemental silicon {{is added}} to molten cast iron as <b>ferrosilicon</b> or silicocalcium alloys to improve {{performance}} in casting thin sections and to prevent the formation of cementite where exposed to outside air. The presence of elemental silicon in molten iron acts as a sink for oxygen, so that the steel carbon content, which must be kept within narrow limits {{for each type of}} steel, can be more closely controlled. <b>Ferrosilicon</b> production and use is a monitor of the steel industry, and although this form of elemental silicon is grossly impure, it accounts for 80% of the world's use of free silicon. Silicon is an important constituent of electrical steel, modifying its resistivity and ferromagnetic properties.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} quantity, the {{dominant}} use for vanadium(V) oxide {{is in the}} production of ferrovanadium (see above).

25|$|Silica fume: A {{byproduct}} of the production of silicon and <b>ferrosilicon</b> alloys. Silica fume is similar to fly ash, but has a particle size 100 times smaller.

25|$|Most {{elemental}} silicon produced {{remains as}} a <b>ferrosilicon</b> alloy, {{and only about}} 20% is refined to metallurgical grade purity (a total of 1.3–1.5 million metric tons/year). An estimated 15% of the world production of metallurgical grade silicon is further refined to semiconductor purity. However, the economic importance of this small very high-purity fraction (especially the ~ 5% which is processed to monocrystalline silicon for integrated circuits) is disproportionately large.|$|E
25|$|Historically, Iceland's economy {{depended}} {{heavily on}} fishing, which still provides 40% of export earnings and employs 7% {{of the work}} force. The economy is vulnerable to declining fish stocks and drops in world prices for its main material exports: fish and fish products, aluminium, and <b>ferrosilicon.</b> Whaling in Iceland has been historically significant. Iceland still relies heavily on fishing, but its importance is diminishing from an export share of 90% in the 1960s to 40% in 2006.|$|E
500|$|Because of the {{rarity of}} natural moissanite, most silicon carbide is synthetic. It {{is used as}} an abrasive, and more {{recently}} as a semiconductor and diamond simulant of gem quality.
