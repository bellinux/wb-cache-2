40|$|This paper {{presents}} a Distributed compressive video sensing scheme with Adaptive measurements (DCVS-AM). In this approach, the key frame in each Group of pictures (GOP) is coded by Compressive sensing (CS) with a <b>fixed</b> <b>measurement</b> rate; whereas other frames {{in the same}} GOP are compressed by an adaptive random projection in two stages, yielding the Adaptive compressive sensing (ACS) frames. The first stage uses a small and <b>fixed</b> <b>measurement</b> rate and recovers a coarse version. In the second stage, each coarse-version ACS-frame together with its proceeding and following key frames will go through a joint analysis at the decoder side and the analysis result - Structural similarity (SSIM) {{that is based on}} a motion-guided interpolation and calculated in a multilevel discrete wavelet transform domain - is sent back to the encoder side to facilitate a re-sampling of the ACS-frame with an adaptive measurement rate.

40|$|Field {{observations}} of new particle formation {{and the subsequent}} particle growth are typically only possible at a <b>fixed</b> <b>measurement</b> location, and hence do not follow the temporal evolution of an air parcel in a Lagrangian sense. Standard analysis for determining formation and growth rates requires that the time-dependent formation rate and growth rate of the particles are spatially invariant; air parcel advection means that the observed temporal evolution of the particle size distribution at a <b>fixed</b> <b>measurement</b> location may not represent the true evolution if there are spatial variations in the formation and growth rates. Here we present a zero-dimensional aerosol box model coupled with one-dimensional atmospheric flow to describe the impact of advection {{on the evolution of}} simulated new particle formation events. Wind speed, particle formation rates and growth rates are input parameters that can vary as a function of time and location, using wind speed to connect location to time. The output simulates measurements at a fixed location; formation and growth rates of the particle mode can then be calculated from the simulated observations at a stationary point for different scenarios and be compared with the ‘true’ input parameters. Hence, we can investigate how spatial variations in the formation and growth rates of new particles would appear in {{observations of}} particle number size distributions at a <b>fixed</b> <b>measurement</b> site. We show that the particle size distribution and growth rate at a fixed location is dependent on the formation and growth parameters upwind, even if local conditions do not vary. We also show that different input parameters used may result in very similar simulated measurements. Erroneous interpretation of observations in terms of particle formation and growth rates, and the time span and areal extent of new particle formation, is possible if the spatial effects are not accounted for...|$|E

This propensity is driven by lower educational level, societal dissatisfaction, liberal partisanship, and economic anxiety. These findings are realized with data from the fifth round of the European Social Survey. The regression of agreement propensities on true explanatory values is made possible by correcting for measurement error in explanatory scores. This resolves two major problems in propensity regression, i. e. errors in variables and imputation errors. These resolutions are attained by a pure randomization theory that places <b>fixed</b> <b>measurement</b> error in design-based regression. This type of regression (versus model-based regression) is used by statistical agencies and polling organizations for sampling large populations...|$|E

In particular, we examine the difference that local and global optimization of local measurements makes to the probability of obtaining an erroneous result, in the regime of finite numbers of copies N, and in the asymptotic limit as N →∞. Five schemes are considered: optimal collective measurements over all copies, locally optimal local <b>measurements</b> in a <b>fixed</b> single-qubit <b>measurement</b> basis, globally optimal <b>fixed</b> local <b>measurements,</b> locally optimal adaptive local measurements, and globally optimal adaptive local measurements. Here, adaptive measurements are those for which the measurement basis can depend on prior measurement results.

In the asymptotic limit, adaptive schemes have no advantage over the optimal fixed local scheme, and except for states with less than 2...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{measurement}} error in observable variables induces bias in estimates in standard regression analysis and that structural equation models are a typical solution to this problem. Often, multiple indicator equations are subsumed as part of the structural equation model, allowing for consistent estimation of the relevant regression parameters. In many instances, however, embedding the measurement model into structural equation models is not possible because the model would not be identified. To correct for measurement error one has no other recourse than to provide the exact values of the variances of the measurement error terms of the model, although in practice such variances cannot be ascertained exactly, but only estimated from an independent study. The usual approach so far has been to treat the estimated values of error variances as if they were known exact population values in the subsequent structural equation modeling (SEM) analysis. In this article we show that <b>fixing</b> <b>measurement</b> error variance estimates as if they were true values can make the reported standard errors of the structural parameters of the model smaller than they should be. Inferences about the parameters of interest will be incorrect if the estimated nature of the variances is not taken into account. For general SEM, we derive an explicit expression that provides the terms {{to be added to the}} standard errors provided by the standard SEM software that treats the estimated variances as exact population values. Interestingly, we find there is a differential impact of the corrections to be added to the standard errors depending on which parameter of the model is estimated. The theoretical results are illustrated with simulations and also with empirical data on a typical SEM model.

While <b>fixed</b> field <b>measurements</b> are found to have the expected Lorentzian characteristic, at fixed frequencies the field swept line shape is in general asymmetric. Such <b>fixed</b> frequency <b>measurements</b> demonstrate that microwave transmission {{can be used to}} access magnetic characteristics of the CMP, such as the field line width Δ H. By developing an effective oscillator model of the microwave transmission we show that these line shape features are general characteristics of harmonic coupling. At the same time, at the classical level the underlying physical mechanism of the CMP is electrodynamic phase correlation and a second model based on this principle also accurately reproduces the experimental line shape features. In order to understand the microscopic origin of the effective coupled oscillator model and to allow for future studies of CMP phenomena to extend into the quantum regime, we develop a third, microscopic description, based on a Green's function formalism. Using this method we calculate the transmission spectra and find good agreement with the experimental results. Comment: 12 pages, 6 figure...|$|R

Oxycon Mobile (OM) is the mobile and wireless version of Oxycon Pro (OP), a commonly used <b>fixed</b> <b>measurement</b> device. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine IC agreement between OM and OP at rest and during steady-state exercise. Also, the within- and between-days variability of IC's were determined. METHODS: Thirty-five healthy subjects were recruited. Twenty-five subjects were included for determining validity of the OM and ten subjects for the variability study. For validation of OM, resting and exercise IC's (IC(rest) and IC(exercise) respectively) were measured consecutively by OM and OP, in random order. Exercise consisted of cycle ergometry at 50 % of subject's predicted maximal exercise capacity. RESULTS: The mean difference between OM and OP regarding IC(rest) was - 0. 05 L, with limits of agreement of - 0. 47 to 0. 37 L (or - 1. 2 % with limits of agreement of - 11. 6 to 9. 3 %) (P> 0. 05). The mean difference of IC(exercise) was - 0. 06 L, and the limits of agreement were - 0. 48 to 0. 35 L (or - 1. 4 % with limits of agreement of - 11. 8 to 9. 0 %) (P> 0. 05). No significant differences in IC's within- or between-days were found. DISCUSSION: The limits of agreement of the IC measured by OM and OP were +/- 10 %, which is recommended for interdevice reproducibility. We conclude that OM and OP can be used interchangeably for measuring IC at rest and during steady-state exercise...|$|E
