5|$|The {{array of}} {{different}} types and styles of ceramic found during the excavations of Gedi provide information about the city's trade ties through the origin of imported vessels and aid in dating the site through seriation. At Gedi, a chronology has been established for the appearance {{of many of the}} ceramics, which have been found in deposits up to five feet. The dated tomb with an inscription connecting it to AD 1399 has served as a <b>datum</b> <b>point</b> for dating the stratigraphic layers. Celadon, Islamic monochromes, and blue and white Chinese porcelain were found in levels above the tomb, which date to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Below the tomb, yellow and black Islamic wares were found down to the natural soil, while celadon was found in layers immediately below the tomb. The celadon below the tomb varied from the celadon found above the tomb, since carvings of lotus pedals were more common on the celadon in the lower layers. Given the date of the tomb, it was determined that the ceramics above the tomb dated to the fifteenth century, which helped extrapolate dates for the remaining stratigraphy.|$|E
25|$|A {{standard}} deviation from this curve was established, and any raw <b>datum</b> <b>point</b> showing a deviation {{as large as}} three times the standard was discarded. Then second-degree curves were similarly fitted to the azimuth/time and elevation/time data. The three second-degree polynomials - for range/time, azimuth/time, and elevation/time - were used to generate a value for position and velocity at mean time of observation, and {{on the basis of}} these values an initial estimate of the elliptical trajectory was made.|$|E
25|$|Distances on {{the system}} are {{measured}} from a <b>datum</b> <b>point</b> at South Gosforth. The system is metric, with distances in kilometres to the nearest metre. Lines are designated In and Out. The In line is from St. James to South Shields via {{the inside of the}} loop (Yellow Line); the Out line is the opposite. By extension the In line is from Airport to South Gosforth, and from Pelaw to Sunderland and South Hylton. Distance plates are mounted on all overhead line structures. Different distances are normally quoted for stations, depending on whether the direction of travel is In or Out. Distances increase from the datum in all directions.|$|E
40|$|In reverse engineering, {{in order}} to meet the {{requirements}} for model reconstruction, it is often necessary to locate and merge the different-view-measured cloud data in a global coordinate system. Many merging methods have been proposed, the method of three <b>datum</b> <b>points</b> is one of them and the registration precision of model data depends on the precision of three <b>datum</b> <b>points</b> which are selected. This paper introduces a new development of the “centroid of apexes” method instead of the former <b>datum</b> <b>points</b> to improve the three points positioning algorithm, the effectiveness of the methods is validated with experimental results and a revised algorithm is presented...|$|R

50|$|Thus {{the current}} {{cumulative}} average {{for a new}} <b>datum</b> <b>point</b> {{is equal to the}} previous cumulative average, times n, plus the latest <b>datum</b> <b>point,</b> all divided by the number of points received so far, n+1. When all of the datum points arrive (n = N), then the cumulative average will equal the final average. It is also possible to store a running total of the <b>datum</b> <b>point</b> as well as the number of points and dividing the total by the number of datum points to get the CMA each time a new <b>datum</b> <b>point</b> arrives.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{new method}} of {{integrate}} simulation for the kinematics and dynamics analysis of complex mechanical system {{is presented in}} this paper. This platform of the method is based on Visual Studio 2005, MD ADAMS (Automatic Dynamic Analysis of Mechanical System) R 3 and Pro/Engineer Wildfire 4. 0. The experimental model is built with Pro/E, and then some functions of Pro/Toolkit are used to export file of parasolid format and coordinates of some specified <b>Datum</b> <b>Points.</b> Finally, the coordinates of these <b>Datum</b> <b>Points</b> are written into a CMD file (Commands file of ADAMS). A slider-crank mechanism {{is used as a}} numerical example to demonstrate the application of the method. It is shown that this approach is a much easier, faster than usual manual method especially for complex mechanical system which has a lot of Marker Points and constraints...|$|R

50|$|Because {{geodetic}} point coordinates (and heights) are always obtained {{in a system}} that has been constructed itself using real observations, geodesists introduce the concept of a geodetic datum: a physical realization of a coordinate system used for describing point locations. The realization is the result of choosing conventional coordinate values for one or more <b>datum</b> <b>points.</b>|$|R

50|$|Kilometers on {{the modern}} Circum-Baikal are {{traditionally}} measured from the Irkutsk exchange station, which until 1934 was the administrative {{border between the}} Tomsk railway and the Transbaikal Railway.

50|$|For {{a number}} of applications, it is {{advantageous}} to avoid the shifting induced by using only 'past' data. Hence a central moving average can be computed, using data equally spaced {{on either side of}} the point in the series where the mean is calculated. This requires using an odd number of <b>datum</b> <b>points</b> in the sample window.|$|R

50|$|In case of {{plane or}} spatial coordinates, we {{typically}} need several datum points. A regional, ellipsoidal datum like ED 50 {{can be fixed}} by prescribing the undulation of the geoid and the deflection of the vertical in one <b>datum</b> <b>point,</b> {{in this case the}} Helmert Tower in Potsdam.
