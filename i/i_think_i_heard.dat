60|$|Wild. [To Jacintha entering.] Do not fear, madam, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> my friend's voice.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> David give {{a little}} grunt; {{but he was too}} well bred to say anything.|$|E
6000|$|... "Come back, McGovery, and don't be a fool. Father Cullen's gone to Dromod. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> him say Tom Ginty wanted him." ...|$|E
5000|$|Tell me whats {{that that}} youre saying / <b>I</b> dont <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> it well ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! ah well, it did {{not occur}} to me. Now you mention it, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> that the Scotch have sort of {{scientific}} tendencies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And {{what is a}} Sensation, Grandfather, tell me, pray? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> never <b>heard</b> {{the word}} So used before to-day: Be kind enough to mention one 'Exempli gratia.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{know that}} would be his wish. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that Mr. Dynevor objected to the school. That might be one {{obstacle}} removed.' ...|$|E
60|$|JUGGINS. A mistake, sir, believe me, {{if you are}} not a born {{artist in}} that line.--Beg pardon, sir, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the bell. [He goes out].|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{told that}} she still lives in Poitou, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that, some years after M. de Lescure's death, she married M. Louis Larochejaquelin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My dear Caddy!" [...] said Mr. Jellyby, looking slowly round {{from the}} wail. It {{was the first}} time, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>I</b> ever <b>heard</b> him say three words together.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> never <b>heard</b> a denser silence {{than that}} which {{followed}} this invitation. Each of the indunas looked at his neighbour, but {{not one of them}} uttered a single word.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{thought you}} had been a {{surveyor}} originally, and that you fell back on the chain because you had no taste for figures. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> as much from yourself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There, {{that is done}} with, Dom Antonio," [...] he said, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> {{this lady}} whisper that with your {{permission}} we will bid you good-bye. My canoe----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh yes. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> Sennett {{speak of}} you. Those biscuit are mighty good. I'll take another. Couldn't persuade {{you to stay}} here, could I?" [...] He turned to Jennie.|$|E
6000|$|... "A lady I {{met on the}} beach, Eustace, who kindly {{restored}} to me a letter that I dropped. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the name" [...] (she turned to the landlady): [...] "Mrs. Woodville, was it not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm not sure--well, yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> of that house," [...] said Kate, [...] "though {{we are not}} in the way {{of hearing}} much about the {{commercial}} houses of London." ...|$|R
6000|$|After {{dinner the}} officer said: “It {{is quite clear}} that you won’t {{be able to return}} to the village. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> that you have no father. Is it not so?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The certain {{proof of}} his excellencies and virtues;" [...] put in the stranger, laughing. [...] "But, if a ward, {{there must be a}} fortune. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> these Wallingfords were richish." ...|$|R
60|$|To {{all this}} I made no answer, but walked gloomily toward the stern {{and looked down}} into the foaming wake. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> the captain tell one of the men {{to keep an eye on}} me.|$|E
6000|$|... "They {{will not}} move till I order them. Stay you sssso!" [...] Kaa hissed, {{and the city}} was silent once more. [...] "I could not come before, Brother, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> thee call"--this was to Bagheera.|$|E
6000|$|... "She is his niece," [...] Louis answered. [...] "She {{has been}} brought up in France at a convent somewhere in the south, I believe. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that this time she was to return to Brazil with her uncle." ...|$|E
60|$|If it had {{not been}} that I could not bear to {{disappoint}} my Indian prince, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> this, <b>I</b> should have turned back then and there at the station.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, that's very proper; family {{feeling is}} very proper," [...] said Dr. Sloper. [...] "I often {{think there is}} not enough of it in our city. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> of your sister." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Il Cupo di Bove {{would be}} a more {{suitable}} model for such a structure," [...] said Eve, smiling. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> that the classical taste of our architects is any thing but rigid." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God knows. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that {{he married}} {{an old woman}} and settled down somewhere. I know he never came up again. Now, I call that a confounded shame. I suppose I'm safe down in Mayo, but there's no knowing what may happen in these days." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{so there}} is, for certain," [...] said his simple companion. [...] "But yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> people {{speaking}} of {{going down to}} Scotland by sea, as well as coming up. Are you well avised of the way?--Do you think it possible we can go by land, my sweet lord?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course I was. He {{was always}} about with you, and called you Phyllis, and {{generally}} behaved {{as if you}} and he were the heroine and hero of a musical comedy, so what else could <b>I</b> <b>think?</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> you singing duets after dinner once. I drew the worst conclusions." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It is {{only his}} manner, I believe,' {{observed}} Kate, timidly; 'he was disappointed in early life, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard,</b> or {{has had his}} temper soured by some calamity. I should be sorry to think ill of him until I knew he deserved it.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly so," [...] said I; [...] "that's just it. There is {{a branch}} of this river that takes a great bend away to the north before it turns towards the sea, is there not? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> {{yourself}} say so before now." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have the}} advantages, besides the better {{memory of a}} younger man, colonel," [...] said Washington, with a playful smile that {{slightly}} reddened the cheek of his aide-de-camp. [...] "Yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> HAVE <b>heard</b> of this phenomenon. By all means, admit her--and her escort." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Somebody {{told me that}} they'd had a queer {{lot about}} the house, and that {{three or four of}} them left just then. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that two or three men from the place went to New Zealand together. It just came out in {{conversation}} while I was in the inn-yard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'A most {{invaluable}} constitution,' Tigg retorted. 'A {{great gift}} for a gentleman employed as you are, Mr Nadgett. Much better than discretion; though you possess that quality also in an eminent degree. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> a double knock. Will {{you put your}} head out of window, and tell me whether there is anybody at the door?' ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Corny was disconsolate, {{and cried}} bitterly. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> her mother call back to her, but I {{am not sure}} about it. There was so much to see and hear. And yet I had been so busy with what I had {{had to do that}} I had seen {{comparatively}} little {{of what was going on}} around me.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have heard}} of your regiment's exploits, sir; and perhaps you may find I have seen some of them, if we should spend ten minutes together. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> of your name too. I beg to drink your health, Captain Wildrake of Squattlesea-mere, Lincolnshire." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That I {{was out of}} hearing, doubtless," [...] {{said the}} King; [...] "and spoke of me as folk speak of absent friends. Make no apology. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> ladies say of their lace, that a rent {{is better than a}} darn.--Nay, be seated.--Where is Chiffinch?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he answered, smiling {{a little}} and {{stroking}} his chin, [...] "yes. Your half-brother's mother had two married sisters, both with large families; but <b>I</b> do not <b>think</b> that Mr. Arthur Eden is intimate with them. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>heard</b> him say as much." ...|$|R
