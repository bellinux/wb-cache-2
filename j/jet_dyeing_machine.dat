40|$|In this study, a {{new idea}} of decolourization was {{investigated}} in which residual dyeing effluent from textile dyeing process was treated using O 3 in the same machine where it was generated. The novelty comes {{from the idea of}} doing dyeing and treatment simultaneously. At the completion of dyeing process, O 3 gas was injected directly into the machine to remove colour and COD from the wastewater. To evaluate the effectiveness of new method, pilot-scale studies were performed, and decolourization of residual dyeing effluents containing C. I. Reactive Orange 7, C. I. Reactive Blue 19, and C. I. Reactive Black 5 was carried out in specially built textile <b>jet</b> <b>dyeing</b> <b>machine.</b> The results showed that almost 100 % colour removal and 90 % COD reduction were achieved when process conditions such as pH, dye concentration (mg/L), ozone production rate (g/hr), and temperature were optimized. The study concludes that new method has a great potential to eliminate the need of a separate end-of-the-pipe wastewater treatment system, thus offering an on-site and cost-effective solution...|$|E

For the past several years a major research program in the School of Textile Engineering at Georgia Tech has been directed toward evaluation of the technical and economi-cal feasibility of directly reusing dye-baths. At the conclusion of the dyeing phase of the cycle. instead of discharg-ing the dyebath to the drain. the dyebath has been analyzed, reconstituted and reused for subsequent dyeings. D y e b h reuce reduces the quantities of dyes. chemicals and energy required for the v Reconstitution and reuse of dyebaths have been extended to the dyeing of fabric in jet dyeing machines. Initial studies were conducted on Nomex Type 455 (polyamide) fabrics dyed to three commercial shades in both pilot scale and full scale in-plant experiments. Dyebaths have been used up to 15 times before being discharged. Color reproducibility, color uniformity, crockfastness and flammability of samples dyed by the reuse system were comparable to those achieved with conventional dyeing. Significant reductions in dye, chemical, water and energy requirements were achieved in the reuse dyeings. The capital cost for modification of a typical <b>jet</b> <b>dyeing</b> <b>machine</b> for reuse dyeing and for the required analytical instrumentation was $ 1 5, 000.

40|$|The present work {{examines}} {{and models}} physico-chemical aspects of dyeing processes of cotton fibre with a direct dye (C. l. Direct Yellow 162). The models and methods {{in this thesis}} were developed {{with the aim of}} providing analytical tools that could help to cut back dyeing process times compared to current standard industrial practice, to reduce the need for dye additions and re-works, and to diminish or eliminate the use of some types of auxiliary, such as levelling agents. Theoretical considerations revealed that three parameters appear to be central to the scaling of jet dyeing equipment: the liquor ratio, the number of fabric as well as of dyeliquor revolutions per minute and the dimensionless parameter L, which describes the influence of the tlow regime in the dyeing machine on the exhaustion kinetics. Experiments on the pilotscale <b>jet</b> <b>dyeing</b> <b>machine</b> showed that, under scaled-down industrial process conditions, the dye uptake rate was not affected by boundary layer effects. Several thermodynamic models were examined for their accuracy to predict the dye amount sorbed by the fibre under equilibrium conditions. Two versions of the Gouy-Chapman model and three models derived from the Donnan membrane equilibrium were evaluated. Best overall results were obtained with a GOlly-Chapman model using a variable fibre saturation molality for the dye. The average back-prediction error of this model for the dye on fibre amount was below two per cent. A newly developed model of the exhaustion kinetics of the dyeing process interprets the dye uptake rate as a combination of rapid dye adsorption at the fibre surface with slow diffusional dye transfer from the surface into the fibre interior. The model predicted the exhaustion values of isothermal experiments with an average accuracy of + 1 - 2. 3...|$|E

40|$|Polyester dyeing in {{atmospheric}} machinery {{relies on}} the use of carriers. Carriers suffer from a number of disad-vantages. The use of some carriers is also inappropriate due to their toxicity or polluting effects. The more environmen-tally benign carriers are generally less effective in promoting dye diffusion in polyester, The beck <b>dyeing</b> <b>machine</b> is still widely used for dyeing piece goods, although the inherent heating and flow patterns limits the average temperature achievable to 200 °F or less. A modifica-tion to beck machines is being patented which ensures full boiling throughout the machine, and allows and achieves faster ramp rates. A series of experiments has been conducted to examine the effectiveness two carriers on the yields of disperse dyes at temperatures typical of tradition-al becks, and modified “Maxitemp”” becks. For a given carrier, small increas-es in temperature give notable increas-es in yield, the effect being greater for the “greener ” carrier, and more notice-able when the dyeing was conducted in open vessels. The patent pending Maxitemp* machine/modification allows significant-ly higher temperatures to be achieved in beck machines, and allow for the use of “greener ” carriers with no loss of yield or increase in dyeing time.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Supercritical fluids {{have special}} {{properties}} {{that could lead}} to substantial improvements when utilized as replacements for water in wet processing of textiles. These fluids have densities and solvating powers similar to liquid solvents combined with viscosity values and diffusion coefficients like those observed for gases. In particular, these properties make supercritical carbon dioxide (SC-CO 2) one of the most beneficial and environmentally acceptable solvents used in manufactur-ing processes today. Therefore, it is anticipated that commercial textile processes using SC-CO 2 will have many advantages when compared to conventional aqueous processes. Succesful commercialization of SC-CO 2 processing will improve the economics of dyeing and other textile chemical processes by eliminating wastewater discharges, reducing energy consumption, eliminating drying, and reducing air emissions. As a result, the use of SC-CO 2 is expected to make textile processing more economical and environmentally friendly. Research groups throughout the world are investigating SC-CO 2 textile processing. Succesful pilot <b>dyeing</b> <b>machines</b> have been operated and even publicly exhibited within the past few years.
