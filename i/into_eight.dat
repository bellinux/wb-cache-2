For a short time in the mid-19th century, the county seat was moved to Newport News.|$|E

They classify themselves <b>into</b> <b>eight</b> gotras, named after the ancestor rishi. Intra-marriage within gotras (Sagotra Vivaha) was uncommon until recently, being discouraged as it was likened to incest, although the taboo has considerably reduced in the case of modern Deshastha families who are bound by more practical considerations.|$|E

5|$|The {{classification}} {{most commonly}} adopted is that proposed by Beier in 1968. He divided the order <b>into</b> <b>eight</b> families. Klass, in 1997, studied the external male genitalia and postulated that the families Chaeteessidae and Metallyticidae diverged {{from the other}} families at an early date. However, the Mantidae and Thespidae are both polyphyletic, so the Mantodea {{will have to be}} revised.|$|E

5|$|As {{implemented}} in October 1970, the CDH system is divided <b>into</b> <b>eight</b> zones: {{six in the}} Lower Peninsula and two in the Upper Peninsula. This contrasts to the state highway system that makes no attempt to group designations by geography in the state. The boundaries for each zone are determined by major state trunkline highways on each peninsula. Each highway is given a designation composed of the zone letter followed by a two-digit number. Within the zone, numbers are assigned on a grid system: north–south highways use odd numbers and east–west highways have even numbers. Lower numbers are used to the south or west sides of the zones.|$|E

5|$|In the balkline games, {{rather than}} drawing balklines {{a few inches}} from the corners, the entire table is divided into {{rectangular}} balk spaces, by drawing balklines a certain distance lengthwise and widthwise across the length of the table a set number of inches parallel out from each rail. This divides the table <b>into</b> <b>eight</b> rectangular balkspaces. Additionally, rectangles are drawn where each balkline meets a rail, called anchor spaces, which developed to stop a number of nursing techniques that exploited the fact that if the object balls straddled a balkline, no count limit was in place.|$|E

The series {{has also been}} localized in other languages such as Chinese, French, and Italian.|$|E
5|$|The French-American-British (FAB) {{classification}} system divides AML <b>into</b> <b>eight</b> subtypes, M0 through to M7, {{based on the}} type of cell from which the leukemia developed and its degree of maturity. This is done by examining the appearance of the malignant cells with light microscopy and/or by using cytogenetics to characterize any underlying chromosomal abnormalities. The subtypes have varying prognoses and responses to therapy. Although the WHO classification (see above) may be more useful, the FAB system is still widely used.|$|E
