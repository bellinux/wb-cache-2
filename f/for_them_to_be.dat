5|$|Their roles imposed several design {{limitations}} on the vessels. The vessels were designed to operate in coastal areas, which required a shallow draft in order <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to enter any port on the Baltic seaboard. They also required a heavy armament, in order <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to engage any hostile ironclad on equal terms. Because Stosch envisioned only local deployments for the vessels, they had limited coal stowage, as they could easily replenish their supply.|$|E
5|$|A serious {{accident}} occurred on 28 April 1980, when a three-coach train carrying 80 passengers from Dalmuir to Motherwell derailed at Hyndland West Junction, just after leaving Jordanhill.

5|$|At {{the urging}} of Groves and Furman, the Alsos Mission was created on 4 April 1944 {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Colonel Boris Pash to conduct {{intelligence}} in the field relating to the German nuclear energy project. The more experienced British considered creating a rival mission, but in the end {{agreed to participate in the}} Alsos Mission as a junior partner. In June 1945, Welsh reported that the German nuclear physicists captured by the Alsos Mission were in danger of being executed by the Americans, and Jones arranged <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> moved to Farm Hall, a country house in Huntingdonshire used for training by MI6 and the Special Operations Executive (SOE).

5|$|Despite {{his fame}} and popularity, like many former {{servicemen}} contending with post-war economic hardship, Smith struggled financially – a predicament compounded by illness. As a consequence he pawned his medals for £20, only <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> recovered by the Jewish Historical Society on {{the urging of}} the wife of Chief Rabbi Joseph Hertz and ultimately reunited with Smith. Smith's varied occupations in post-war Britain included work as an actor with a theatre troupe. He emigrated to Australia in 1925 with his wife Elsie (née McKechnie), whom he had married at Camberwell Register Office. Marriage to Elsie produced two children (Olive and Maurice) and reputedly angered his parents despite the couple's later observance of Jewish religious tradition in a formal ceremony held at Central Synagogue, Hallam Street.|$|E
5|$|During {{the march}} through {{vineyards}} and cornfields, the emaciated children ate {{as much as}} they could. Lukić states that the Partisans rested the remaining children at Žumberak for a day, before arranging <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> transferred across the Kupa river into liberated areas of the Bosanska Krajina. According to one survivor, Mihajlo Veljić, some of the children who were liberated from the camp by the Partisans inAugust 1942 were placed with families in the Žumberak district and were subsequently re-captured by the Ustaše. Some were killed and others were returned to the camp.|$|E
5|$|Four locals {{had been}} {{identified}} by the committee as witnessing Cornfoot being killed and being involved in her mistreatment although the three main perpetrators, who had by then left the area, were an Orcadian, a man from Burntisland and a Sea captain's son. A schoolboy, two Englishmen and another person were also implicated but had absconded. The committee determined that Bailie Cook, whose residence the mob had seized Cornfoot from, should carry {{a significant amount of}} the blame. Four males suspected of being present at the murder were held in custody but were released by Cowper in defiance of the Privy Council's instruction <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> taken to Edinburgh for trial.|$|E

5|$|Geilo Airport {{was opened}} in 1985 as a {{regional}} airport. On 20 June 1986, Coast Aero Center was awarded the concession for flying from Stavanger to Geilo Airport, Dagali until 1991. The airline used a Beechcraft 200 Super King Air on the service. At the same time, Norving started operations to Oslo. The ridership from Geilo {{turned out to be}} insufficient to make a profit, and both Coast Aero Center and Norving terminated their routes. Widerøe and Norsk Air said there was not enough ridership <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> interested. In 1989, Coast Air received a one-year concession to operate from Geilo to Oslo and Stavanger. The company used de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter aircraft. The service was soon limited to two round trips each week.|$|E
5|$|In June 1940, the Government of Madras {{appointed}} a committee headed by Srinivasa Sastri to frame {{a set of}} general principles for coining words for scientific and technical terms in vernacular languages. The constitution of the committee was strongly condemned by the Madras Presidency Tamil Sangam and its Secretary E. M. Subramania Pillai who felt that Srinivasa Sastri was biased in favour of Sanskrit and hence, Anti-Tamil. The committee submitted its report after three months recommending the retention of the existing Sanskrit loanwords in Tamil and rejecting the need <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> replaced. The deliberations of the Sastri Committee provoked widespread agitations in Madras Presidency. The committee was eventually reshuffled by Provincial Education Minister T. S.

5|$|In early 1964 Sihanouk {{signed a}} secret {{agreement}} with North Vietnam and the Viet Cong, allowing Chinese military aid meant <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> delivered through Sihanoukville's port.

In addition, he also allowed the Viet Cong to build a trail through eastern Cambodia, so that their troops could receive war supplies from North Vietnam. The trail later became known as the Sihanouk Trail. When the US learned of Viet Cong presence in eastern Cambodia, they started a bombing campaign over it, spurring Sihanouk to sever diplomatic ties with the US in May 1965. As a result of this secret agreement, Communist countries, including China, the Soviet Union, and Czechoslovakia, provided military aid to Cambodia.|$|E

Prosecutors, in their appeals against the 20-year terms faced by most of the nine, had only called <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> upgraded to life imprisonment. Czugaj's life sentence, after being reduced to 20 years on appeal, was reinstated. Stephens' life sentence was upheld on appeal as were Sukumaran's and Chan's death sentences.

The utility's documentation, along with the forum post, contained little information as to how necessary keys could be obtained.

5|$|The {{objective}} in a detonation level is to plant and detonate explosive devices {{on a number}} of enemy positions, which can consist of anti-aircraft guns, tanks and armored cars. Some positions must be hit twice <b>for</b> <b>them</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> destroyed. Players can protect their positions by defusing the explosives before they detonate. In one variation of this game mode, one side has to defend their positions for a set amount of time, with the destruction of each piece of equipment giving the enemy team more time. The defenders win if they can hold their positions long enough for the time to run out, while the attackers win when all objectives have been destroyed. In the alternate version, both teams must attack the other's objectives while defending their own. The first team to destroy all of the enemy's equipment wins.|$|E
