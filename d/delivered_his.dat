5|$|Despite his willing {{adherence}} to the Southern position {{on the issues that}} were dividing the country, Mallory was not prominent in the secession movement. He advocated reconciliation almost up to the moment that Florida passed its ordnance of secession. That occurred on January 10, 1861, making Florida the third state (behind South Carolina and Mississippi) to leave the Union. On January 21, Mallory <b>delivered</b> <b>his</b> farewell speech in the United States Senate.|$|E

5|$|On 2 July 1942 Driberg {{cast his}} first {{vote in the}} House of Commons, in support of Churchill against a rebel motion of censure on the government's conduct of the war. The rebels' case was put incompetently, which ensured that the motion gained only 25 votes, as against 477 cast for the government. Driberg <b>delivered</b> <b>his</b> maiden speech on 7 July, in a debate {{on the use of}} propaganda. He called for the lifting of the ban on the Communist Party's newspaper, the Daily Worker, which he saw as a {{potentially}} valuable weapon of home propaganda.|$|E

5|$|The Law of Prairial was the {{breaking}} point for opponents of Robespierre. Resistance to the Terror spread throughout the Convention, and Saint-Just was compelled to address the division. Bertrand Barère and other Thermidorians have claimed that he proposed a dictatorship for Robespierre, but nonetheless some of them considered him to be redeemable, or at least useful – until he <b>delivered</b> <b>his</b> uncompromising public defence of Robespierre on 9 Thermidor (27 July 1794).|$|E

5|$|The {{election}} {{took place}} on November 4, and Barack Obama was projected the winner at about 11:00 pm Eastern Standard Time; McCain <b>delivered</b> <b>his</b> concession speech in Phoenix, Arizona about twenty minutes later. In it, he noted the historic and special significance of Obama becoming the nation's first African American president. In the end, McCain won 173 electoral college votes to Obama's 365; McCain failed to win most of the battleground states and lost some traditionally Republican ones. McCain gained 46percent of the nationwide popular vote, compared to Obama's 53percent.|$|E
5|$|With the 1860 {{election}} of Abraham Lincoln, {{the first president}} from the largely anti-slavery Republican Party, conventions in thirteen slave states ultimately declared secession and formed the Confederate States of America, while the federal government maintained that secession was illegal. The ensuing war was at first for Union, then after 1863 as casualties mounted and Lincoln <b>delivered</b> <b>his</b> Emancipation Proclamation, a second war aim became abolition of slavery. The war remains the deadliest military conflict in American history, resulting {{in the deaths of}} approximately 618,000 soldiers as well as many civilians.|$|E
5|$|After the {{purchase}} was approved, Jefferson drafted {{a system of}} governing the newly acquired territory. Fearing that the Federalists would oppose any system he had devised, he <b>delivered</b> <b>his</b> draft to Breckinridge {{and asked him to}} introduce it in the Senate as his own. To maintain the ruse, Breckinridge moved that a committee be formed to recommend a plan for governing Louisiana Territory. Working through the committee, he brought Jefferson's plan to the Senate floor with its essentials intact. Because the plan provided for the taxation of Louisiana residents without giving them representation in Congress, Federalists and some Democratic-Republicans opposed it. Nevertheless, it passed by a vote of 26–6.|$|E

5|$|Although McKinley enjoyed {{meeting the}} public, Cortelyou was {{concerned}} with his security due to recent assassinations by anarchists in Europe, such as the assassination of King Umberto I of Italy the previous year, and twice tried to remove a public reception from the President's rescheduled visit to the Exposition. McKinley refused, and Cortelyou arranged for additional security for the trip. On September 5, the President <b>delivered</b> <b>his</b> address at the fairgrounds, before a crowd of some 50,000 people. In his final speech, McKinley urged reciprocity treaties with other nations to assure American manufacturers access to foreign markets. He intended the speech as a keynote to his plans for a second term.|$|E
5|$|In 354BC, Demosthenes <b>delivered</b> <b>his</b> first {{political}} oration, On the Navy, {{in which}} he espoused moderation and proposed the reform of the symmoriai (boards) {{as a source of}} funding for the Athenian fleet. In 352BC, he delivered For the Megalopolitans and, in 351BC, On the Liberty of the Rhodians. In both speeches he opposed Eubulus, the most powerful Athenian statesman of the period 355 to 342BC. The latter was no pacifist but came to eschew a policy of aggressive interventionism {{in the internal affairs of}} the other Greek cities. Contrary to Eubulus's policy, Demosthenes called for an alliance with Megalopolis against Sparta or Thebes, and for supporting the democratic faction of the Rhodians in their internal strife. His arguments revealed his desire to articulate Athens's needs and interests through a more activist foreign policy, wherever opportunity might provide.|$|E
5|$|On 9th Dhu al-Hijjah before noon, pilgrims {{arrive at}} Arafat, a barren and plain land some 20 {{kilometers}} east of Mecca, {{where they stand}} in contemplative vigil: they offer supplications, repent on and atone for their past sins, and seek mercy of God, and listen to sermon from the Islamic scholars who deliver it from near Jabal al-Rahmah (The Mount of Mercy) from where Muhammad {{is said to have}} <b>delivered</b> <b>his</b> last sermon. Lasting from noon through sunset, this is known as 'standing before God' (wuquf), {{one of the most significant}} rites of Hajj. At Masjid al-Namirah, pilgrims offer noon and afternoon prayers together at noon time. A pilgrim's Hajj is considered invalid if they do not spend the afternoon on Arafat.|$|E

5|$|On August 23, Obama {{announced}} his selection of Delaware Senator Joe Biden as his vice presidential running mate. Obama selected Biden from a field speculated to include former Indiana Governor and Senator Evan Bayh and Virginia Governor Tim Kaine. At the Democratic National Convention in Denver, Colorado, Hillary Clinton called for her supporters to endorse Obama, {{and she and}} Bill Clinton gave convention speeches in his support. Obama <b>delivered</b> <b>his</b> acceptance speech, not at the center where the Democratic National Convention was held, but at Invesco Field at Mile High to a crowd of approximately 84,000 people; the speech was viewed by over 38million people worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Other {{influential}} 2nd century authors include Juvenal and Pliny the Younger, {{the latter}} of whom {{was a friend of}} Tacitus and in 100 <b>delivered</b> <b>his</b> famous Panegyricus Traiani before Trajan and the Roman Senate, exalting the new era of restored freedom while condemning Domitian as a tyrant. Juvenal savagely satirized the Domitianic court in his Satires, depicting the Emperor and his entourage as corrupt, violent and unjust. As a consequence, the anti-Domitianic tradition was already well established {{by the end of the}} 2nd century, and by the 3rd century, even expanded upon by early Church historians, who identified Domitian as an early persecutor of Christians, such as in the Acts of John.|$|E
5|$|That evening Kennedy held a {{televised}} {{press conference on}} the possibility of a domestic Peace Corps-like program to reduce racism in white suburbs. On April 8 Kennedy and his wife went, at the request of Coretta Scott King, to Atlanta to attend Martin Luther King Jr.'s funeral. That evening he held a meeting with his aides over how {{to get the attention of}} middle-class whites weary of the civil rights movement in order to relieve the racial tension in the country. Kennedy returned to Indiana and on April 10 <b>delivered</b> <b>his</b> third and final speech inspired by King's death. Moving past his previous calls for compassion and an end to violence, he admonished whites to accept and welcome blacks into American society. Throughout the rest of the month, Kennedy toned down his campaign rhetoric and fixed on a theme of unity and reconciliation.|$|E
