25|$|After {{three days}} the {{infantry}} was exhausted and the advance bogged down, {{as it became}} increasingly difficult to move artillery and supplies over the Somme battlefield of 1916 and the wasteland of the 1917 German retreat to the Hindenburg Line. German troops had also examined abandoned British supply dumps which caused some despondency, when German troops {{found out that the}} Allies had plenty of food despite the U-boat campaign, with luxuries such as chocolate and even Champagne falling into their hands. Fresh British troops had been <b>hurried</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> region and were moved towards the vital rail centre of Amiens.|$|E
500|$|While the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, again vainly {{attacked}} Hill 570 on September 11, North Korean soldiers {{seized the}} crest of Hill 314 [...] southeast of it and that much closer to Taegu. Actually, the two hill masses are adjacent and their lower slopes within small arms range of each other. The North Koreans drove the 16th Reconnaissance Company from the hill and only the ROK 5th Training Battalion, previously <b>hurried</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> line from Taegu in a supporting position, prevented the North Koreans from gaining complete control of this terrain feature. This ROK battalion still held part of the reverse slope of Hill 314 when the 3rd Battalion, 8th Cavalry, hurried to the scene from its attacks on Hill 570 and tried to retake the position. The ROK battalion twice had attacked and reached the crest but could not hold it, and had dug in on the lower southern slopes. The 3rd Battalion, 7th Cavalry, command post had to fight off infiltrating North Koreans on September 12 as it issued its attack order and prepared to attack through the 8th Cavalry lines against Hill 314.|$|E

He took a hat-trick against Transvaal aged just 18 and, when Athol Rowan was injured, he was <b>hurried</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> test team against Australia in 1949–50. He played in all five Tests and, on a sticky wicket at Durban, took seven for 23 when Australia crashed from 31 for no wicket to 75 all out. South Africa erred by not {{enforcing}} the follow on and Neil Harvey won the match for Australia.|$|E
