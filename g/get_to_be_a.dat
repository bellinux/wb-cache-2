Its heavier sound was inspired by bands the group's members were listening to in the two weeks they wrote their fourth album, Take Off Your Pants and Jacket, such as Fugazi and Refused.

500|$|Persona 4 {{received}} {{critical acclaim}} from game critics upon release. Jeff Gerstmann of Giant Bomb {{described it as}} [...] "one of the best times I've had with video games, whether I was playing by myself or watching someone else play it."

It also noted that the soundtrack can be [...] "a bit repetitive". RPGFan's Ryan Mattich recommended Persona 4 as [...] "one of the best RPG experiences of the year", noting that [...] "among the cookie-cutter sequels and half-hearted remakes", the game is [...] "a near flawless example of the perfect balance between 'falling back on what works' and 'pushing the genre forward'." [...] 1UP.com's Andrew Fitch summarized Persona 4 as [...] "some of this decade's finest RPG epics", although the reviewer criticized its [...] "slight loading issues" [...] and the time spent [...] "waiting for the plot to advance". GameTrailers gave the game a score of 9.3, stating it's an exception to the rule of the Japanese role-playing genre, and that it stands out of any other JRPG, including its predecessor, Persona 3. Wired pointed out that while the graphics are not up to par with those of the Xbox 360 or PlayStation 3, [...] "the clever art style makes up for that". It also praised the game's soundtrack as [...] "excellent, especially the battle music".|$|E

30|$|With {{respect to}} the {{differences}} by facility type, at merge segment, MR <b>gets</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>a</b> factor related <b>to</b> the 1 st component due to the increased interruption of ramp traffic {{with the increase of}} traffic density. During the variation in traffic conditions, the significance of DR becomes lower than geometric variation at diverge segment. However, in high-density uncongested flow, LD is more important in contrast to low-density uncongested flow. Once a driver feels the difficulty for lane-changing maneuvers in diverging area, they may move onto the nearest lane to off-ramp in advance in the upstream of diverging area. As a result, the impact of lane-changing maneuvers on mainline traffic gets relatively low.
