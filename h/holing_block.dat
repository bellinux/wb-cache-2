40|$|In {{this paper}} we present {{the effect of}} {{thickness}} variation of hole injection and <b>hole</b> <b>blocking</b> layers {{on the performance of}} fluorescent green organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs). A number of OLED devices have been fabricated with combinations of hole injecting and <b>hole</b> <b>blocking</b> layers of varying thicknesses. Even though <b>hole</b> <b>blocking</b> and <b>hole</b> injection layers have opposite functions, yet there is a particular combination of their thicknesses when they function in conjunction and luminous efficiency and power efficiency are maximized. The optimum thickness of CuPc (Copper(II) phthalocyanine) layer, used as hole injection layer and BCP (2, 9 dimethyl- 4, 7 -diphenyl- 1, 10 -phenanthroline) used as <b>hole</b> <b>blocking</b> layer were found to be 18 nm and 10 nm respectively. It is with this delicate adjustment of thicknesses, charge balancing is achieved and luminous efficiency and power efficiency were optimized. The maximum luminous efficiency of 3. 82 cd/A at a current density of 24. 45 mA/cm(2) and maximum power efficiency of 2. 61 lm/W at a current density of 5. 3 mA/cm(2) were achieved. We obtained luminance of 5993 cd/m(2) when current density was 140 mA/cm(2). The EL spectra was obtained for the LEDs and found that it has a peaking at 524 nm of wavelength. (C) 2012 Elsevier B. V.

These parameters are the toss indicator and the content of difficult-to-screen particles in the feed. The experiments presented in the paper showed that description in mathematical terms of the sieve <b>holes</b> <b>blocking</b> process is complex and difficult. A third degree polynomial function with two variables enables determination of the value of an average screen blocking coefficient in the processes of screening for specific arrangements: screen–particle–toss indicator–content of difficult-to-screen particles...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} the carrier {{blocking}} layer on the emission color of the color tunable organic light emitting devices (OLEDs) have been investigated. Color tuning {{is controlled by the}} applied voltage. Both the experimental and theoretical results show that inserting a <b>hole</b> <b>blocking</b> layer between two adjacent emission layers will make the color tunable region move toward the wide bandgap emission layer of blue color in our case. By replacing the <b>hole</b> <b>blocking</b> layer with an electron blocking layer, the color tunable region will shift toward the small bandgap emission layer of red. Besides shifting the tunable region toward the pure spectral color, the introduction of the carrier blocking layer can extend the color tunable range. © 2007 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Various methods of film deposition have been explored, and they revealed the tradeoff between pinhole free coverage (large shunt resistance) and small film thickness (small series resistance). It is hypothesized that atomic layer deposition (ALD) with its self-limiting nature and sub-nanometer level control {{would be able to}} circumvent this problem and provide TiO 2 films of pinhole free coverage and small thickness. TiO 2 films made by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) and ALD were investigated and compared. Conductive atomic force microscopy (CAFM) was used to characterize film morphology and conductivity. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) was utilized to analyze film composition and chemical state. Cyclic voltammetry (CV) was able to reveal the <b>hole</b> <b>blocking</b> capability of films. Finally, organic photovoltaic devices were made with different TiO 2 films to reveal the relationship between device property and film characteristic.
