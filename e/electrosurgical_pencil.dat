40|$|Background and Objectives: The aim of {{our study}} is to {{evaluate}} the role of electrosurgery and vaginal closure technique {{in the development of}} postoperative vaginal cuff dehiscence. Methods: From prospective surgical databases, we iden-tified 463 patients who underwent total laparoscopic hys-terectomy (TLH) for benign disease and 147 patients who underwent laparoscopic-assisted vaginal hysterectomy (LAVH) for cancer. All TLHs and LAVHs were performed entirely by use of electrosurgery, including colpotomy. Colpotomy in the TLH group was performed with Har-monic Ace Curved Shears (Ethicon Endo-Surgery, Cincin-nati, OH, USA), and in the LAVH group, it was performed with a monopolar <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>pencil.</b> The main surgi-cal difference was vaginal cuff closure—laparoscopically in the TLH group and vaginally in the LAVH group. Results: Although patients in the LAVH group were at increased risk for poor healing (significantly older, higher body mass index, more medical comorbidities, higher blood loss, and longer operative time), there were no vaginal cuff dehiscences in the LAVH group compared with 17 vaginal cuff dehiscences (4 %) in the TLH group (P. 02). Conclusion: It does not appear that the increased vaginal cuff dehiscence rate associated with TLH is due to elec-trosurgery; rather, it is due to the vaginal closure tech-nique...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground and aims. To {{introduce}} a special dissection technique named “Curettage and Aspiration Dissection Technique” (CADT) using a versatile instrument called Peng's Multifunction Operative Dissector (PMOD) for liver resection. PMOD is an <b>electrosurgical</b> <b>pencil</b> with an inline suction, bearing four functions: electric cutting, coagulation, aspiration and dissection, The above-mentioned functions {{can be achieved}} simultaneously or sequentially during liver resection. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate this technique and the special electrosurgical device in hepatic surgery. Patients and methods. From June 2005 to December 2006, 70 consecutive patients with segmentectomy or major hepatectomy were performed with this dissection technique by the same surgeon. Peri-operative data and the technical aspect of this device and dissection technique for various types of liver resection were summarised. Results. Forty-nine of 70 cases with various degrees of cirrhosis. Median blood loss were 470 ml (100 – 2400 ml), the bleeding and mortality within one month postoperatively was zero. There were postoperative complications in 20 patients: bile leak occurred in five cases, nine cases with right pleural effusion and six with ascites. No relative complications with this method were found. Conclusion. The CADT and PMOD can achieve better dissection and hemostasis. It possible is a much more valuable alternative to other devices currently used for liver surgery...|$|E
