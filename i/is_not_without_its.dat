5|$|The {{memorial}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>its</b> critics. Alana Vincent {{has argued}} that constituent parts of the monument are in conflict, {{and as a result}} the message conveyed by the monument is not unified. Visually, Vincent argues there is a dichotomy between the triumphant pose of the figures {{at the top of the}} pylons and the mourning posture of those figures at the base. Textually, she argues the inscription text celebrating the victory at the Battle of Vimy Ridge strikes a very different tone to the list of names of the missing at the base of the monument.|$|E
5|$|Since 1990, Burger King has {{continued}} using Coca-Cola as its beverage supplier, renewing its contract in several times. The Coca-Cola contract <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>its</b> problems; the 1999 contract {{called for the}} Coca-Cola branded Icee products to be made a permanent menu item in all American locations. After the rollout, {{it was discovered that}} Coca-Cola employees had faked product test information to bolster prospective sales numbers in an effort to entice franchisees to enroll in a summertime advertising push. Several Coke employees were terminated, and Coca-Cola changed the in-store promotional materials to emphasize the Icee name. The 2003 contract officially extended {{the relationship between the two}} companies so that Coca-Cola was the exclusive supplier of soft drinks for the company. Before this, individual international franchises would negotiate their own contracts with their company of choice. The 2003 contract gave Coca-Cola new access to the 3,000 operating or planned restaurants on the Asia-Pacific rim, in Europe, and in South and Central America. The purchase of Burger King by 3G Capital lead to a change in the beverage contract for the Caribbean and Latin America markets. 3G, which owns AmBev and is the producer and distributor of PepsiCo products in the region, started cross-licensing between its two companies in April 2011 and switched to Pepsi in these markets.|$|E

25|$|Because {{it had a}} {{wide range}} of courses, Otago {{attracted}} more students from outside its provincial district. This led to the growth of colleges and informal accommodation in north Dunedin around the faculty buildings. This development of a residential campus gave Otago a more vibrant undergraduate student life {{at the same time as}} comparable but smaller developments in Christchurch, Wellington and Auckland were eclipsed in the late 20th century. Otago now has the most substantial residential campus of any university in New Zealand or Australia, although this <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>its</b> problems.|$|E

25|$|Radiation therapy {{may be used}} {{to treat}} almost every type of solid tumor, {{including}} cancers of the brain, breast, cervix, larynx, liver, lung, pancreas, prostate, skin, stomach, uterus, or soft tissue sarcomas. Radiation is also used to treat leukemia and lymphoma. Radiation dose to each site depends on a number of factors, including the radio sensitivity of each cancer type and whether there are tissues and organs nearby that may be damaged by radiation. Thus, as with every form of treatment, radiation therapy <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>its</b> side effects.|$|E
25|$|The {{ingestion}} of prophylaxis iodide and iodate <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>its</b> dangers, There is reason for caution about taking potassium iodide or iodine supplements, as their unnecessary use can cause {{conditions such as}} the Jod-Basedow phenomena, and the Wolff-Chaikoff effect, trigger and/or worsen hyperthyroidism and hypothyroidism respectively, and ultimately cause temporary or even permanent thyroid conditions. It can also cause sialadenitis (an inflammation of the salivary gland), gastrointestinal disturbances, allergic reactions and rashes. Potassium iodide is also not recommended {{for those who have}} had an allergic reaction to iodine, and people with dermatitis herpetiformis and hypocomplementemic vasculitis, conditions that are linked to a risk of iodine sensitivity.|$|E
25|$|Birds use a {{combination}} of their beaks and feet to excavate burrow nests. The tunnel is started with the beak; the bird either probes at the ground to create a depression, or flies toward its chosen nest site on a cliff wall and hits it with its bill. The latter method <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>its</b> dangers; there are reports of kingfishers being fatally injured in such attempts. Some birds remove tunnel material with their bills, while others use their bodies or shovel the dirt out with one or both feet. Female paradise-kingfishers are known to use their long tails to clear the loose soil.|$|E

25|$|While Slovenia is {{a fairly}} {{peaceful}} country, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>its</b> faults. Minority groups in Slovenia, particularly the Roma and any residents from former Yugoslav republics face discrimination and sometimes brutality by Slovenian police. The Roma, in particular, are targets because of how stereotyped they are as an inherently criminal population. The Roma often live in illegal settlements in very low socio-economic conditions, which contributes to their discrimination and their reputation as criminals. The Roma {{are one of the}} ethnic minorities from former Yugoslavic states known as 'the erased' who, after Slovenia's declaration of independence in 1991, lost all legal status, social, civil and political rights. This made them particularly vulnerable to police brutality. Their rights have still not been fully restored. Due to their lack of rights and legal status, it is difficult to hold police accountable for offences committed against them.|$|E
25|$|A new wing, {{called the}} Millennium Wing, was opened in 2002. Unlike the {{previous}} two extensions, this new wing has street frontage and the English architects Benson & Forsyth gave it an imposing Bowers Whitbed, Portland Stone façade and grand atrium. The design originally involved demolishing an adjoining Georgian terrace house and its ballroom mews; however, the Irish planning appeals authority, An Bord Pleanála, required that they be retained. The Millennium Wing <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>its</b> critics: it is unforgiving of poor maintenance and the compromise in the design as required by An Bord Pleanala resulted in a final design diluted from the original competition winning building concept. The circulation space also lacks clarity, but it is generally considered that these flaws are trivial details set against {{the drama of the}} building. In line with its Brutalist style, the interior concrete walls are still unsealed.|$|E
25|$|Its {{large and}} menacing appearance, {{combined}} with its relative placidity, {{has made the}} sand tiger shark {{among the most popular}} shark species to be displayed in public aquaria. However, as with all large sharks, keeping them in captivity <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>its</b> difficulties. Sand tiger sharks {{have been found to be}} highly susceptible to developing spinal deformities, with as many as one in every three captive sharks being affected, giving them a hunched appearance. These deformities have been hypothesized to be correlated to both the size and shape of their tank. If the tank is too small, the sharks have to spend more time actively swimming than they would in the wild, where they have space to glide. Also, sharks in small, circular tanks often spend most of their time circling along the edges in only one direction, causing asymmetrical stress on their bodies.|$|E

500|$|Volk {{notes that}} that the {{earliest}} references to Astronomicaaside from literary allusionsmay {{be found in}} two Roman funerary inscriptions, both of which bear the line, [...] "We are born to die, and our end hangs from the beginning" [...] (nascentes morimur finisque ab origine pendet) from the poem's fourth book. This theory <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>its</b> detractors, and scholars such as A. Maranini and Gómez Pallarès have suggested that these two inscriptions are likely Renaissance forgeries.|$|E
500|$|There {{have been}} {{international}} efforts since the 1970s to persuade practitioners to abandon FGM, {{and it has}} been outlawed or restricted in most of the countries in which it occurs, although the laws are poorly enforced.

The opposition to the practice <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>its</b> critics, particularly among anthropologists, who have raised difficult questions about cultural relativism and the universality of human rights.|$|E

In the following years, Kassandra experiences further visions. When she is twelve, Kassandra sees a vision of Paris, who is now a shepherd. Kassandra asks her father the boy's identity but he reacts angrily. Kassandra is sent to be fostered by Hecuba's sister Penthesilea, chief of the Amazonsa nomadic warrior tribe consisting only of women. There, Kassandra comes to love their lifestylethough it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>without</b> <b>its</b> trialsand she learns of her twin, continuing to experience visions of him. Kassandra sees the Judgement of Paris, in which her brother deems Aphrodite more beautiful than Athena or Hera; Aphrodite rewards Paris by eventually promising the love of Helen of Spartadaughter of Leda and Zeus.|$|E
