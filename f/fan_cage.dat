A longtime comics <b>fan,</b> <b>Cage</b> amassed an impressive collection over the years, but in October 2002, he auctioned off most of his collection for combined proceeds of over $1.68 million through Heritage Auctions. Heritage sold Nicolas Cage's remaining comics privately over the next year for approximately another $325,000, and in 2009 they also auctioned part of Cage's Movie Poster collection. Cage also starred the 2007 film Ghost Rider and its 2012 sequel Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance.|$|E

These fans were not necessary on older cards because of their low power dissipation, but most modern graphics cards designed for 3D graphics and gaming need their own dedicated cooling fans. Some of the higher powered cards can produce more heat than the CPU (dissipating up to 289 watts), so effective cooling is especially important. Since 2010, graphics cards have been released with either axial fans, or a centrifugal fan commonly known as a blower, turbo or squirrel <b>cage</b> <b>fan.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Te Huna {{defeated}} veteran journeymann Antony Rea whilst {{competing for}} the Cage Fighting Championship promotion. He became the Cage Fighting Championship Light Heavyweight World Champion at CFC 10 by defeating Anthony Perosh by first round KO. Te Huna was later sanctioned by the promotion for illegally stomping on Perosh after the referee had stopped the bout. Cage Fighting Championship promoter Luke Pezzutti issued the following statement concerning Te Huna's behaviour, [...] "To Anthony Perosh and the supporters/ <b>Fans</b> of <b>Cage</b> Fighting Championship, we apologize and do not condone nor tolerate the un-sportsman like actions of James Te-Huna at the CFC 10 August 21 event where the referee Ivan Walton stepped in to stop the fight between James and Anthony, {{and as a result}} of his actions that evening he has been fined 20% of his fight purse and has offered to write a letter of apology to Anthony Perosh, CFC officials and the supporters of CFC. CFC officials will amend rules, regulations to further prevent this type of behavior from our athletes." [...] A formal letter of apology was duly issued on Te Huna's behalf.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{and demonstrates}} a mathematical algorithm that can monitor the physical {{parameters of the}} motor solely by observing the stator electrical currents. This method uses measurements of transient stator currents to identify the parameters of an electromechanical model of the induction motor. These parameters are obtained from a relatively poor initial guess, which is constrained only to be within {{an order of magnitude}} of the physical parameters, by using a twostep strategy based upon nonlinear least-squares regression techniques. This makes the approach in this paper useful for diagnostic monitoring and energy scorekeeping. Experimental results are presented which demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on identifying the parameters of a 1 HP induction motor connected to a squirrel <b>cage</b> <b>fan</b> in an air-handling unit.

50|$|Marvel Studio began {{development}} for Ghost Rider {{as early as}} 1992 and were in discussions with potential distributors. In 1997 Gale Anne Hurd was listed as producer, with Jonathan Hensleigh attached to write the script. David S. Goyer developed a script and in May 2000 Marvel announced an agreement with Crystal Sky Entertainment to film Ghost Rider with actor Jon Voight attached as a producer. Production was scheduled to start in early 2001 with a budget of $75 million and Johnny Depp expressing interest in the lead role. The following August, Dimension Films joined Crystal Sky to co-finance the film, which would be directed by Stephen Norrington. Producer Avi Arad approached Eric Bana {{on the possibility of}} playing Ghost Rider, but opted to cast him in Hulk instead. In June 2001, actor and Ghost Rider <b>fan</b> Nicolas <b>Cage</b> entered talks to be cast into the lead role, after having found out about Depp being a possibility for the role and contacted the director to express his own interest. Norrington would drop out within a few months due his commitment to Tick Tock and Cage eventually left the project as well. By May 2002 Columbia Pictures sought to acquire rights to Ghost Rider in turnaround from Dimension Films following their success with Spider-Man. They brought Shane Salerno to rewrite Goyer's script.|$|R
50|$|Air {{entered the}} fan through the central eye and exited through the rim. These fans were thus all suction devices, extracting air from a mine and {{releasing}} {{it to the}} atmosphere. A typical installation comprised a pit head building, usually built of stone at this period, with a fan engine house alongside it. The fan was mounted high in {{the gap between the}} buildings, with a connection into the pithead through a circular window in the building and into the eye of the fan. The pithead was made airtight against its reduced internal pressure by shuttered windows and close-fitting doors. If the same building was also used for winding - the lowering and raising of men and equipment - the winding gear could be mounted in the clear space above the shaft, without interfering with the <b>fan</b> arrangements. Mine <b>cages</b> and trams passed through the usual self-closing air doors.|$|R

[...] The ninth episode [...] "Choreographed" [...] marked the return of Mariska Hargitay's character to the Special Victims Unit. The episode starred Bob Saget as a suspicious husband. Hargitay expressed her excitement about working with Saget and called him [...] "America's biggest secret." [...] The eleventh episode [...] "Burned" [...] starred Michael Michele as an alleged rape victim who gains the sympathy of Detective Benson but not Detective Stabler. This reunited her with Eriq LaSalle, Neal Baer and Mariska Hargitay from her time on ER. LaSalle, who directed the episode, joked that [...] "It also gave him an excuse to boss Michael Michele around." ...|$|R

40|$|AbstractInlet {{is one of}} {{the basic}} {{elements}} of squirrel <b>cage</b> <b>fan</b> that can have great effect on performance and losses, especially between inlet nozzle exit and first section of impeller width. But, enough research has not been done on its parameters. In this paper the effect of axial gap between inlet nozzle and impeller on performance and flow pattern is considered. Four inlet nozzle sizes with respect to impeller size (two smaller, nearly same and bigger than inner impeller diameter) and three axial gaps within the physical dimensions of the casing and impeller were chosen. Numerical simulations with different turbulence models, special geometry and mesh pattern were performed to find the effect of this axial gap on flow pattern, performance and efficiency. For the validation of numerical results, some experiments were done and all the performance parameters were compared with that of numerical simulations. These results show good matching between experimental and numerical results. From the simulation of each case study, flow pattern and its mechanism and the causes affecting the efficiency and performance due to axial gap are analyzed and presented...|$|R
40|$|The paper reviews {{developments}} in Seafarming and searanching in the Philippines. Seafarming activities concentrated on seaweeds and molluscs, technology for which are already widely practiced. In Seafarming of oysters and mussels, technology is mature but only applied in traditional sites. As such, {{the quality of}} products and consumption is low due to known pollution of oyster and mussel farming areas. Seafarming of giant clams is just beginning. Hatchery techniques of producing juveniles are being refined for mass production and seeding of reef areas to enhance giant clam population. Seafarming of marine fishes is also practiced but constrained {{by the lack of}} seed stock. Sea <b>cage</b> <b>fanning</b> operators mainly depend on wild-caught fry and juveniles although the hatchery technology for sea bass has been developed. There is more research work to be done to mass-produce fry and juveniles for Seafarming of other fish species. Seafarming and searanching appear to be the future major means of supplementing the production of animal protein by year 2000 as arable land continues to dwindle. Declining arable land area would not be sufficient to produce the food needs of the increasing population. There is great potential for Seafarming and searanching to enhance coastal resources and produce more food. However, {{there is a need to}} provide stronger legal and institutional support for these activities to sustain development efforts...|$|R
50|$|Xander goes to Prague {{and meets}} with the NSA support team {{including}} Czech agent Milan Sova, who explains that Cage {{is only in}} Prague because Gibbons had put pressure on Sova {{and if he does}} anything wrong, he will be deported back to America. Cage flips this show of authority by saying that he doesn't want to be there and pointing out that he's never been under anyone's jurisdiction. He tells Sova off that if he wants to take his anger out on someone, take it on the person who cheaply sold him the suit he wears. While scouting an Anarchy 99 party, Xander purposely reveals Sova's cover after catching the latter flashing his badge in front of the bar patrons, which allows him to gain the confidence of Anarchy 99's leader, Yorgi. Through Yorgi's brother Kolya, who is a <b>fan</b> of <b>Cage's</b> show, Xander gains critical information on the military background of Anarchy 99's members. Xander is attending a car deal with Yorgi at his invitation when Sova shows up and starts a firefight. Xander shoots Sova with a fake blood-splatter round {{to make it look like}} he is dead, which causes Yorgi to fully accept Xander as a member of Anarchy 99. Xander returns with Yorgi to their headquarters, a castle outside of the city, where he meets Yorgi's girlfriend Yelena. Xander finds Yelena trying to break into Yorgi's safe and, taking her to a nearby restaurant, tells her he is an American agent. Yelena gets a call from Kirill, a sniper working for Yorgi, who reveals they know of Xander's true identity before he starts firing on them. Yelena and Cage work together to help each other escape by staging a fight between them, which results in Cage knocking Yelena out with a serving tray. Cage is then kidnapped by the NSA team and taken to Gibbons, who tells Xander to return home since his cover is blown, but Xander refuses as he fears for Yelena's safety from both Yorgi and a planned attack on the castle by special forces. Xander learns that Sova purposely blew his cover.|$|R
40|$|Growth. mortality. production. {{physiology}} and seasonal cycles of condition index and proximate biochemical composition of experimental populations of blue mussels (Mytilus edulis L.) were studied at different sites in Loch Etive and Loch Leven on the West coast of Scotland between May 1990 and September 1992. The main {{objective of the}} study was to evaluate current suspended mussel culture practices and to establish the basis for their possible integrated cultivation with salmon <b>cage</b> <b>fanning.</b> In addition. a preliminary investigation on employment of the. Charm IT' system as a rapid method for detecting residues of drugs used for treating cultured salmon in the tissues of mussels was carried out. There were some differences between sites in salinity, seston and particulate organic matter, but not in chlorophyll-a. Food availability (as particulate organic matter and chlorophyll-a) showed a clear seasonal cycle and in consequence growth of mussels were relatively rapid from late-spring until mid-autumn (g 6 months) and very slow or absent during the rest of the year. This period of rapid length and tissue growth coincided with relatively optimum environmental conditions and there were apparent positive relationships between monthly growth rates and temperature and chlorophyll-a values, indicating the limiting effect of these two primary factors on growth during autumn-winter and even in early spring. Almost all growth parameters examined were showed significant differences between the lochs. Growth performance of both native and transplanted mussels in Loch Leven was quite poor. Overall annual length increments were 25. 1 - 25. 9 mm at sites in Loch Etive and Dunstaffnage Bay, but 20. 1 - 22. 8 mm in Loch Leven. A crosstransplantation experiment showed that site rather than stock is the main reason for differences in growth parameters between Lochs Etive and Leven. These observed growth differences between sites and stocks were also confirmed by physiological measurements and estimated growth potential or scope for growth. Growth of mussels at salmon farms was faster than at neighbouring mussel farms during two annual experiments, but only meat weight at one salmon farm during experiment I, and length and live weight at the salmon farm in Loch Etive as well as all growth parameters at the salmon fann in Loch Leven during experiment II were significantly greater (>sO. 05). These differences were most likely a result of high particulate organic matter levels at salmon fanns. Similar to growth, biomass and production, the condition index and biochemical composition of mussels showed a clear seasonal cycle. Meat content, condition index and glycogen values were high during summer, started to decline in late autumn and reached minimum values in April before showing maximum increases in May. This reflects the typical storage and reproductive cycle of mussels in Northern Europe: accumulation of reserves during summer and their utilization during winter and early spring as energy resources for metabolism and reproduction. This cycle clearly showed that the main spawning of mussels on the West coast of Scotland occurred during March-May, and primary spat settlement from June to August. Heavy losses occurred from French socks, causing substantial amounts of eliminated biomass during experiment I, but when these fall outs were eliminated during experiment II by using lantern nets, it was clear that natural mortality rates were quite low and similar at all sites. Apart from growth characteristics and physiological responses, there were persistent morphological differences between the Loch Etive and Loch Leven populations. Cross-transplantation and physiological measurements after various acclimatization periods showed that, while morphological differences might be related to genetic origin, all other differences between the two popUlations are governed by environmental factors. The practical implications of these findings for developing suspended mussel culture on the West coast of Scotland and the possibility of a simple integrated salmon-mussel fanning system, which could be effective in controlling potential eutrophication from intensive salmon <b>cage</b> <b>fanning</b> and the removing large amounts of organic matter by mussels leading alterations in ecosystem, are discussed. A preliminary study with the Chann II Test has showed that the system is not so appropriate method as expected for screening mussel tissue sampled straight from the field, since mussel tissues require purification due to interference from bacteria or microbial detritus, before screening...|$|R
