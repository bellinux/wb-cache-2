5|$|Argon {{is used to}} <b>displace</b> oxygen- and moisture-containing air in {{packaging}} material to extend the shelf-lives of the contents (argon has the European food additive code E938).

40|$|In this paper, we {{document}} the post-displacement employment patterns observed between 1979 and 2004 for <b>displaced</b> workers aged 50 to 54. We uncover four key patterns. First, we detect no upward {{trend in the}} re-employment rates of male <b>displaced</b> workers in the aggregate, in manufacturing or outside manufacturing. Second, we show that re-employment rates of <b>displaced</b> women generally increased over time. Third, we find substantial evidence that median and average earnings losses of males <b>displaced</b> from manufacturing in recent years (i. e. between 2000 and 2004) were {{higher than those of}} comparable cohorts <b>displaced</b> during the 1980 s. Part of this increase is related to the lower re-employment rates observed in recent years for males <b>displaced</b> from manufacturing. These lower re-employment rates suggest that, following displacement, aggregate working hours likely fell for males <b>displaced</b> from manufacturing. Finally, we show that median and average earnings losses of women <b>displaced</b> from non-manufacturing firms fell over time. Layoffs, Job security, Job loss, Job stability, Labour turnover...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to study displacement operations in offshore petroleum industry. Typically MEG or Methanol is circulated through parts of the subsea production systems to lower their hydrocarbon content. This is often done {{at the beginning of}} a prolonged production shut-in, to avoid formation of hydrates or to minimize the emissions of chemicals to the environment when a component is to be replaced. Experimental and numerical analyses have been conducted on a previously built pipe system formed like a U-shaped jumper. Through the project it has been investigated necessary <b>displacing</b> time required to achieve target hydrocarbon concentration in the domain, optimal displacement rate for efficiently removal of hydrocarbons, and how these variables depend on different fluids and their properties. The investigation was performed through measuring the volume fraction in the domain of the <b>displacing</b> fluid by draining the jumper, after the fluid had been flooding in the system for a certain time. The system was filled and <b>displaced</b> with both water and Exxsol D 60. The experimental results have been used as validation for the accuracy of the models made in the transient multiphase flow commercial simulator LedaFlow®. A sensitivity analysis was performed, considering density, viscosity, interfacial tension, different fluids and geometry. The experimental results showed small changes in the amounts <b>displaced</b> between 2 and 3 volumes. For the displacement to be considered successful, a criterion of a volume fraction for the <b>displacing</b> fluid higher than 95 % was set. For oil <b>displacing</b> water, a flow rate of 28. 16 m 3 /h was required. For water <b>displacing</b> oil, 20. 77 m 3 /h was sufficient. LedaFlow predicted the volume fractions well, deviating from the experimental points with an average of 5. 5 % for oil <b>displacing</b> water and 5. 7 % for water <b>displacing</b> oil. The sensitivity analysis showed significant changes in the <b>displaced</b> amounts, when changing the density of the <b>displaced</b> fluid. For a density a bit higher than the <b>displacing</b> fluid, the amount was decreasing exponentially as the density increased. Changes in viscosities for both the <b>displacing</b> fluid and the fluid to be <b>displaced</b> had little effect, unless the viscosity of the <b>displacing</b> fluid was highly increased. It was observed a linear relationship between changes in interfacial tension and obtained volume fraction. Simulations with methanol <b>displacing</b> oil predicted higher amounts <b>displaced</b> than when oil <b>displaced</b> water. With gas included as a fluid to be <b>displaced</b> in the system, the <b>displaced</b> amounts were reduced. With a dead-leg included in the geometry, it showed no visible effects in the simulation. Experimental data and observations have been obtained. The results of the numerical models in LedaFlow are in good agreement with the experimental data...|$|R

5|$|The {{impact of}} meat ants on other species varies, {{depending}} on the habitat and type of food source, and the ecological role the ant plays. The deliberate exclusion of meat ants show that not only can they alter the amount of sources available, but the dynamics of resource use on entire outcrops. If present, meat ants rely on rapidly discovering food sources and retain their dominance so other ants cannot collect them, as well as exploitation and interference which helps <b>displace</b> other ants. The habitat meat ants live in may affect their dominance among the fauna. They are less successful in complex habitats and more successful in open areas, allowing workers to forage efficiently; for example, workers forage around rocks and collect food sources more successfully in contrast to those in vegetation. Meat ants are even more dominant than other I. purpureus species group members in non-complex habitats. Meat ants are normally larger than other Iridomyrmex species and can <b>displace</b> or even kill those trying to compete for food sources. The similar behaviours among meat ants and certain Iridomyrmex species have increased the level of conflict among each other, especially those in open habitats.|$|E
