I identify anomalies in equities, relate the book-to-market anomaly and the size anomaly to cash-flow risk, and document a strong cross-sectional predictor of FX volatility returns. In {{the first part of}} my dissertation I show that <b>Gross</b> <b>Yield</b> negatively predicts <b>returns</b> in the cross section of equities. In the second part of my dissertation I explore the role of cash-flow risk in driving book-to-market and size related returns. Furthermore, I show that equity returns increase with higher cashflow beta. In the third part I show that the ratio of implied to historical volatility explains the cross-section of FX variance swap returns. This ratio also predicts underlying currency returns...|$|R

Primary {{data were collected from}} 45 private and 11 government farms from 9 selected districts covering major fish seed producing areas of Bangladesh. Results from Cobb-Douglas production function analysis indicated that the included variables had some positive impacts on returns from spawn and fingerlings. No input was found to be over used and increasing returns to scale was observed. Tabular analysis indicated that higher amount of input use produced higher level of <b>yield,</b> <b>gross</b> <b>return</b> and net return. The government farms were under utilized.

After reviewing several previous studies on the market efficiency, this paper makes three new attempts: first, we employs the actual information on transactions and rents at the property level to resolve the substitution problems; second, we introduce another pricing method which use <b>gross</b> <b>yields</b> and typical cap rate method; lastly, Shiller Test with those actual data is conducted to determine whether future rental growth can be predicted by both or either of those two pricing methods. The major empirical results can be summarized into the two findings: 1) in the pricing models, the <b>gross</b> <b>yield</b> reflects a property's future rental growth, whereas the cap rate is mostly correlated to the relatively short-term rental growth in the past, 2) in Shiller Test, the future rental growth of a property can be forecasted by the <b>gross</b> <b>yield,</b> not by the cap rate. These findings suggest that although not perfect, investors of the US office properties, at least partially, forecast the future income of the investments, and reflect them into the pricings by means of <b>gross</b> <b>yields</b> rather than cap rates. by Jinbae Jeong.

The irrigation was applied when sum of daily pan evaporation (5 years) from United States Weather Bureau (USWB) Class A open pan reached approximately up to 16. 3 mm after ac-counting for rainfall. The crop was irrigated by drip irrigation system. Irrigation at 150 % of pan evaporation replenishment and 0. 5 m lateral spacing resulted in higher marketable yield of primary and secondary flowers. A further increase in irrigation amount resulted from 200 % pan evapora-tion replenishment reduced marketable flower yield significantly. The higher irrigation production efficiency was recorded at 50 % of pan evaporation replenishment and 0. 5 m lateral spacing and it decreased significantly with an increase in irrigation amount and lateral spacing Irrigation at 150 % of pan evaporation replenishment resulted in a higher net return and benefit-cost ratio. The lateral spacing of 1. 0 m gave higher net return and benefit-cost ratio as compared to lateral spacing of 0. 5 m. The seasonal water applied and marketable flower <b>yield,</b> <b>gross</b> <b>return,</b> net return and bene-fit-cost ratio exhibited quadratic relationship which can be used for optimising economic return of broccoli under variable irrigation and lateral spacing.

40|$|In {{the first}} essay titled “Monthly Cyclicality in Retail Investors’ Liquidity and Lottery-type Stocks at the Turn of the Month”, {{we find that}} the {{well-documented}} underperformance of lottery stocks masks a within-month cyclical pattern. Demand for lottery stocks increases {{at the turn of the}} month especially in areas whose demographic profile resembles that of the typical lottery-ticket buyers (i. e., gamblers) driving their prices higher at the turn of the month. This effect is particularly pronounced among firms located in areas whose demographic profile resembles that of the typical lottery-ticket buyer and propelled by the within-month cyclicality of local investors’ personal liquidity positions. A long-short investment strategy based on this cyclical pattern of lottery stocks performance <b>yields</b> <b>gross</b> abnormal <b>returns</b> of about 15 % per year. In the second essay titled “Lottery-type Stocks and Corporate Strategies at the Turn of the Month”, we test whether cyclical demand for lottery stocks by retail investors, that tends to peak at the turn-of-the-month (ToM), affects firms’ financial activities. Consistent with the notion that the peak in demand is driven by a propensity to gamble and is associated with inattention, we find underreaction to earnings news issued at the ToM by lottery-type firms located in areas with many gambling investors. We also find that the ToM also provides a window of opportunity for SEO issuing lottery-type firms. Such issuing firms may strategically choose to issue lottery-type stocks at the ToM to save the direct marketing costs because it flattens the elasticity of pre-offer demand curve...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Approaches to {{reducing}} irrigation inputs to crops {{have been studied}} for the past 50 to 60 years in research settings. Fewer efforts {{have been made to}} document limited irrigation responses over a number of seasons on commercial fields. This study compared farm−based irrigation management (FARM) with best management practices (BMP), late initiation of irrigation (LATE), and a restricted allocation (ALLOC). These irrigation management strategies each occupied 1 / 8 of a center pivot system in southwest Nebraska in continuous corn production, on four cooperating farms, which were replicated at the same sites for 3 to 6 years. Irrigation variables were achieved by irrigating or not irrigating, or by speeding up or slowing down the center pivot. When the grain yields and irrigation amounts were normalized each year using the FARM treatment as the basis, on average for three of four locations, the BMP treatment yielded equal to the FARM treatment, the LATE treatment yielded 93 % of the FARM treatment and the ALLOC yielded 84 % of the FARM treatment. At the same time, it took 76 % and 57 % of the water for the LATE and ALLOC treatments, respectively, to achieve these <b>yields.</b> The adjusted <b>gross</b> <b>returns</b> (<b>yield</b> price – irrigation treatment costs) of the irrigation treatments were analyzed for each location. When the gross returns were normalized using the FARM treatment as the basis, FARM and BMP returns were equal across combinations of high and low input commodity prices and pumping costs. The LATE treatment gross return was 95 % of FARM return. The gross return for the ALLOC treatment was 85 % to 91 % of the FARM treatment. The higher the water costs, the lower the difference between the highest and lowest returning water treatments. Relationships between evapotranspiratio...|$|R

25|$|The main number {{which is}} used to assess the value of the bond is the <b>gross</b> {{redemption}} <b>yield.</b> This is defined such that if all future interest and principal repayments are discounted back to the present, at an interest rate equal to the <b>gross</b> redemption <b>yield</b> (<b>gross</b> means pre-tax), then the discounted value is equal to the current market price of the bond (or the initial issue price if the bond is just being launched). Fixed income investments such as bonds and loans are generally priced as a credit spread above a low-risk reference rate, such as LIBOR or U.S. or German Government Bonds of the same duration. For example, if a 30-year mortgage denominated in US dollars has a <b>gross</b> redemption <b>yield</b> of 5% per annum and 30 year US Treasury Bonds have a <b>gross</b> redemption <b>yield</b> of 3% per annum (referred to as the risk free yield), the credit spread is 2% per annum (sometimes quoted as 200 basis points). The credit spread reflects the risk of default. Risk free interest rates are determined by market forces and vary over time, based on a variety of factors, such as current short-term interest rates, e.g. base rates set by central banks such as the US Federal Reserve, the Bank of England in the UK, and the Euro Zone ECB. If the coupon on the bond is lower than the yield, then its price will be below the par value, and vice versa.|$|R
