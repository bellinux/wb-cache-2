Each pixel comprises a small capacitor with three electrodes, one for each primary color (some newer displays include an electrode for yellow). An electrical discharge across the electrodes causes the rare gases sealed in the cell to be converted to plasma form as it ionizes. Being electrically neutral, it contains equal quantities of electrons and ions and is, by definition, a good conductor. Once energized, the plasma cells release ultraviolet (UV) light which then strikes and excites red, green and blue phosphors along the face of each pixel, causing them to glow.|$|E

When data are presented by configurations of attractants and behaviour of the slime mould is tuned by {{a range of}} repellents, the organism preforms computation. It maps given data configuration into a protoplasmic network. To discover physical means of programming the slime mould computers we explore conductivity of the protoplasmic tubes; proposing that the network connectivity of protoplasmic tubes shows pathway-dependent plasticity. To demonstrate this we encourage the slime mould to span a <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes</b> and apply AC stimuli to the network. Learning and weighted connections within a <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes</b> is produced using negative and positive voltage stimulation of the network at desired nodes; low frequency (10 Hz) sinusoidal (0. 5 V peak-to-peak) voltage increases connectivity between stimulated electrodes while decreasing connectivity elsewhere, high frequency (1000 Hz) sinusoidal (2. 5 V peak-to-peak) voltage stimulation decreases network connectivity between stimulated electrodes.

As activity may distribute unevenly within muscle volumes, particularly for pennate calf muscles, surface electromyograms (EMGs) detected by traditional bipolar montage may provide biased estimations of muscle activity. We compared cocontraction estimates obtained using bipolar vs <b>grids</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes</b> (high-density EMG, HD-EMG). EMGs were collected from medial gastrocnemius, soleus and tibialis anterior during isometric plantar and dorsi-flexion efforts at three levels (30 %, 70 % and 100 % MVC), knee flexed and extended. Cocontraction index (CCI) was estimated separately for each electrode pair in the grid. While soleus and tibialis anterior CCI estimates did {{not depend on the}} detection system considered, for gastrocnemius bipolar electrodes provided larger cocontraction estimates than HD-EMG at highest effort levels, at both knee angles (ANOVA; P <. 001). Interestingly, HD-EMG detected greater gastrocnemius EMGs distally during plantar flexions, and greater CCI values proximally during dorsiflexions. These results suggest that bipolar electrodes: (i) provide reliable estimates of soleus and tibialis anterior cocontraction; (ii) may under-or overestimate gastrocnemius cocontraction, depending on their distal or proximal position...|$|R

Moreover, we test whether conventional mono- and bipolar montages provide representative MEPs compared to those from the <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes.</b> Our results show that MEPs with the greatest amplitudes were elicited for 45 ° and 90 ° coil orientations, i. e. perpendicular to the central sulcus, for all electrode montages. Stimulation with the coil oriented at 135 ° and 315 °, i. e. parallel to the central sulcus, elicited the smallest MEP amplitudes. Additionally, changes in coil orientation did not affect the spatial distribution of MEPs over the muscle extent. It has been shown that conventional electrodes with detection volume encompassing the APB belly may detect representative MEPs for optimal coil orientations.

Using electrocorticographic (ECoG) recordings from a subject rhythmically producing consonant-vowel syllables (CVSs) we show that neural oscillators recorded at individual ECoG electrodes become precisely synchronized to initiations of the production of CVSs (i. e., that these initiations occur at precise phases of bandpassed-filtered voltages recorded at most ECoG electrodes). This synchronization is not a trivial consequence of the rhythmic production of CVSs, since it takes several minutes to be fully established and is observed at the frequency of CVS production and at its second harmonic. The phase of filtered voltages at which CVSs are produced varies systematically across the <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes,</b> consistently with the propagation of traveling waves (TWs).

40|$|AbstractA {{different}} symmetry {{is required}} to optimize {{each of the three}} most common Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR MS) electric potentials in a Penning (ICR) ion trap: one-dimensional dipolar ac for excitation (or detection), two-dimensional azimuthal quadrupolar ac excitation for ion axialization, and three-dimensional axial quadrupolar dc potential for ion axial confinement (trapping). Since no single trap shape simultaneously optimizes all three potentials, many trap configurations have been proposed to optimize the tradeoffs between the three requirements for a particular experiment. A more general approach is to divide each electrode into small segments and then apply the appropriate potential to each segment. Here, we extend segmentation to its logical extreme, by constructing a “matrix-shimmed” trap consisting of a cubic trap, with each side divided into a 5 × 5 <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes</b> for a total of 150 electrodes. Theoretically, only 48 independent voltages need be applied to these 150 electrodes to generate all three desired electric potential fields simultaneously. In practice, it is more convenient to employ 63 independent voltages due to construction constraints. Resistive networks generate the potentials required for optimal quadrupolar trapping and quadrupolar excitation. To avoid resistive loss of excitation amplitude and detected signal, dipolar excitation/detection voltages are generated with a capacitive network. Theoretical Simion 6. 0 simulations confirm the achievement of near-ideal potentials of all three types simultaneously. From a proof-of-principle working model, several experimental benefits are demonstrated, and proposed future improvements are discussed...|$|E

Geophysical approaches, electrical methods in particular, are being increasingly applied to landslide monitoring because they provide non-invasive spatial information in heterogeneous subsurface environments that {{can be difficult to}} characterise using surface observations or intrusive sampling alone. Electrical techniques are sensitive to changing subsurface moisture conditions, and have proven to be a useful tool for investigating the hydrogeology of natural and engineered slopes. The objectives of this investigation were to further develop electrical resistance monitoring for slope stability assessment, and to validate the approach at an intermittently-active UK landslide system to advance the understanding of complex landslide activation mechanisms. A long-term transfer resistance dataset was collected from a <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes</b> to allow spatial monitoring of the landslide. These data were interpreted using a synthesis of rainfall, temperature, GPS and piezometric records.

Results reveal that resistance monitoring is sensitive to soil moisture accumulation, including changes in piezometric levels, and can be used to study the principal activation mechanism of slow-moving shallow earthflows. Spatial monitoring using resistance maps was shown to be particularly valuable as it revealed the evolution of subsurface moisture distribution, in the lead up to landslide activation. Key benefits of this approach are that it provides a simple, rapid and non-invasive means of spatially monitoring subsurface moisture dynamics linked to landslide activation at high-temporal resolution.

Multiple electrodes are combined to form a digital electrode bus. This proposed topology represents the next stage in the evolution of bioelectric measurement as, due to the decrease in cost and size of integrated circuits, more of the bioinstrumentation circuitry is shifted away from a base measurement station and into the electrode itself. The prototype wireless device outlined in this paper consists <b>of</b> a <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrode</b> nodes. By adding a circuit weighing less than 0. 45 g and with a diameter of 1. 5 cm to standard button clip electrodes, each node contains a high resolution analog-to-digital converter, and a microcontroller. With this design, the lead length has been reduced to a copper PCB track with dimensions of less than 3. 5 x 0. 3 mm. All of the nodes are connected onto a shared I 2 C bus on which a master node synchronises slave electrode sampling and coordinates inter-device communication. The system is currently capable of a 215 Hz sampling rate (for one node at 16 -bit resolution) with a limit of up to 79 nodes connected. The system has been demonstrated to work on the electrooculogram and the electrocardiogram and the results for these have been outlined...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1950 s, electrocorticography (ECoG), the {{measurement}} of electrical potentials {{on the surface of}} the brain has become an invaluable tool in neurosurgery for the localization of epileptic foci before resection. The ECoG electrodes used in clinical practice are made in an archaic serial process that involves hand-soldering wires to a stiff, coarse <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes</b> with a spatial resolution > 1 cm, and a tangle of transcranial wires. In this thesis we report a modern microfabrication process based on photolithographic patterning of conductor thin films and of Parylene C, a biocompatible, transparent polymer. We used that process to make very thin and flexible ECoG arrays with electrode densities exceeding those of their clinical counterparts by more than two orders of magnitude, and addressed interconnect and noise performance issues. We constructed devices with multiple interconnected conductor layers, and used transparent conductors for integration of ECoG with optical neural stimulation techniques. Moreover, we developed a microscale ECoG with integrated loop antenna for a fully implantable, wireless system. To show that such high-resolution devices have practical utility, we conducted acute and chronic in vivo studies in rats. We found that sufficiently small ECoG electrodes were able to register superficial multi-unit activity. We computed high-resolution tonotopic maps of the auditory cortex in anesthetized rats, and demonstrated that functional mapping using signal power in the 70 Hz - 170 Hz band (high-&gamma) is consistent with but much quicker and often more robust than functional mapping using action potentials recorded intracortically with penetrating electrodes. Finally we demonstrated that &muECoG can serve as a less invasive alternative to penetrating electrodes in a brain-machine interface (BMI) paradigm by training awake behaving rats, chronically implanted with &muECoG, to perform a 1 D center-out task with auditory feedback by differentially modulating the high-&gamma signal on electrodes separated by as little as 200 &mum...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} ways to improve clinical diagnostic tools is to use microfluidic Lab-on-a-chip devices. Such devices can provide a dense array of fluidic components and sensors at the micro-scale which drastically reduce the necessary sample volumes and testing time. This dissertation develops a unique electrochemical sensor array in a microfluidic device for high-throughput, label-free detection of both DNA hybridization and protein adsorption experiments. The device consists of a patterned 3 x 3 <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes</b> which can be individually addressed and microfluidic channels molded using the elastomer PDMS. The channels are bonded over the patterned electrodes on a silicon or glass substrate. The electrodes are designed to provide a row-column addressing format {{to reduce the number of}} contact pads required and to drastically reduce the complexity involved in scaling the device to include larger arrays. The device includes straight channels of 100 micron height which can be manually rotated to provide either horizontal or vertical fluid flow over the patterned sensors. To enhance the design of the arrayed device, a series of microvalves were integrated with the platform. This integrated system requires rounded microfluidic channels of 32 micron height and a second layer of channels which act as pneumatic valves to pinch off selected areas of the microfluidic channel. With the valves, the fluid flow direction can be controlled autonomously without moving the bonded PDMS layer. Changes to the mechanism of detection and diffusion properties of the system were examined after the integration of the microvalve network. Protein adhesion studies of three different proteins to three functionalized surfaces were performed. The electrochemical characterization data could be used to help identify adhesion properties for surface coatings used in biomedical devices or for passivating sensor surfaces. DNA hybridization experiments were performed and confirmed both arrayed and sensitive detection. Hybridization experiments performed in the valved device demonstrated an altered diffusion regime which directly affected the detection mechanism. On average, successful hybridization yielded a signal increase 8 x higher than two separate control experiments. The detection limit of the sensor was calculated to be 8 nM...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we created four network topologies {{composed}} of living cortical neurons and compared resultant structural-functional dynamics including the nature and quality of information transmission. Each living network was composed of living cortical neurons that were created using microstamping of adhesion promoting molecules and each was designed with different levels of convergence embedded within each structure. Networks were cultured over a <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> <b>electrodes</b> that permitted detailed measurements of neural activity at each node in the network. Of the topologies we tested, the Random networks in which neurons connect {{based on their own}} intrinsic properties transmitted information embedded within their spike trains with higher fidelity relative to any other topology we tested. Within our patterned topologies in which we explicitly manipulated structure, the effect of convergence on fidelity was dependent on both topology and time-scale (rate versus temporal coding). At long time scales associated with rate based coding the simple linear 2 D or line networks produced the highest fidelity during transmission among neurons (nodes) followed by 4 D (4 connections per node) and 8 D (8 connections per node) grid networks. By contrast, at more precise temporal scales it was the increased convergence within the 8 D topology that now resulted in the highest fidelity followed by 4 D and 2 D networks. A more detailed examination using tools from network analysis revealed that these changes in fidelity were also associated with a number of other structural properties including a node’s degree, degree-degree correlations, path length, and clustering coefficients. Whereas information transmission was apparent among nodes with few connections, the greatest transmission fidelity was achieved among the few nodes possessing the highest number of connections (high degree nodes or putative hubs). These results provide a unique view into the relationship between structure and its affect on transmission fidelity, at least within these small neural populations with defined network topology. They also highlight the potential role of tools such as microstamp printing and microelectrode array recordings to construct and record from arbitrary network topologies to provide a new direction in which to advance the study of structure-function relationships...|$|E

40|$|Brain {{electrical}} stimulation (BES) {{has long been}} suggested {{as a means of}} controlling pathological brain activity. In epilepsy, control of a spatially localized source, the seizure focus, may normalize neuronal dynamics. Consequently, most BES research has been directed at controlling small, local, neuronal populations. At a higher level, pathological seizure activity {{can be viewed as a}} network event that may begin without a clear spatial focus or in multiple sites and spread rapidly through a distributed cortical network. In this paper, we begin to address the implications of local control in a network scenario. To do so, we explore the efficacy of local BES when deployed over a larger-scale neuronal network, for instance, using a <b>grid</b> <b>of</b> stimulating <b>electrodes</b> on the cortex. By introducing a mean-field model of neuronal interactions we are able to identify limitations in network controllability based on physiological constraints that suggest the need for more nuanced network control strategies.
