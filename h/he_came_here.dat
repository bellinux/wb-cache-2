Bok {{explains}} {{that it was}} his son in command of the Ferengi vessel at Maxia, and <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> seeking his revenge. He places the orb down and leaves Picard on the Stargazer bridge. The orb lights up once more, leaving Picard believing he is once again at the Battle of Maxia. On the Enterprise, Lt. Tasha Yar (Denise Crosby) and Lt. Worf (Michael Dorn) discover the orb brought over from the Stargazer in Picard's chest. They take it to Riker as the Stargazer powers up its weapon systems. Riker hails the Ferengi vessel and speaks to Kazago, who is suspicious {{at the sight of the}} orb, which is a banned device. He promises to investigate.|$|E

Using his trusty ring-like weapon, the Wind Bullet, he is {{determined}} to rid the world of five great monsters who are causing trouble, as well as discover the secret to why <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in the first place.

500|$|Nevertheless, Macdonald {{continued}} {{to push the}} government to commit itself to conscription if circumstances should change. His position earned him the enmity of the politically cautious Mackenzie King. [...] "Macdonald is a very vain man", the prime minister complained in his diary, [...] "and has an exceptional opinion of himself. Undoubtedly, <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> expecting to possibly lead the Liberal party later on but has found {{that he will not}} be able to command the following that he expected".|$|E

"The Captain," [...] {{said the}} oracular old lady, who was rapidly driving John mad, [...] "commands a twenty-sixth {{part of the}} British army, {{and he says that}} <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>here</b> to farm with Uncle Silas Croft. He says," [...] she went on, with {{withering}} contempt, [...] "that <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>here</b> to farm when he commands a twenty-sixth part of the British army. It is evident that he lies." ...|$|R

500|$|In August 1963, Nhu, who {{controlled}} {{the special forces}} and secret police, allowed Đính to have a hand in planning raids against Buddhist dissidents who had been organising at the Xá Lợi pagoda, Saigon's largest. The raids involved the deployment of the 5th Division, based {{in the town of}} Biên Hòa on Saigon's northern outskirts, into the capital. Although the execution of the raids—which left hundreds dead—was primarily the responsibility of Colonel Lê Quang Tung, the special forces head, Đính privately took responsibility, stating to a journalist, [...] "I have defeated Henry Cabot Lodge [...] <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> to stage a coup d'etat, but I, Tôn Thất Đính, have conquered him and saved the country." [...] In the aftermath of the raids, Foreign Minister Vũ Văn Mẫu resigned in protest, shaved his head like a monk and sought to leave on a pilgrimage to India; Nhu ordered Đính to jail him. At the urging of another general, Đính put Mẫu under house arrest instead.|$|E

He was much more interesting to look at because of the wider range of his scoring strokes. At his best he was probably harder to get out than ever...|$|E

2500|$|Faragher {{was very}} sad {{to leave the}} island, but {{he tried to keep}} up to date with it as best as he could through letters and by reading The Isle of Man Examiner, sent to him each week {{courtesy}} of Roeder. He wrote in thanks to Roeder, commenting sadly that [...] "I am not longing for much but a sight of the sea." [...] He composed a lot of poetry whilst first at his son's, until illness overtook him. His son wrote that: [...] "He has been writing verse since <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> until his head got bad, and now he says he shall write no more." [...] One of the most striking poems of this period comments on his sorrow at the decline of Manx culture: ...|$|E
2500|$|Đính privately claimed {{responsibility}} for the pagoda attacks, stating to a journalist, [...] "I have defeated Henry Cabot Lodge [...] <b>He</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> to stage a coup d'état, but I, Ton That Dinh, have conquered him and saved the country." [...] During this period, Đính claimed he was [...] "a great national hero". His ego had been played upon by the Ngô brothers, who reiterated this point and paid him a large cash bonus after the pagoda raids. In the heady times after the attacks, Đính told his American advisors that [...] "he was without doubt the greatest general officer in the ARVN, the saviour of Saigon … and soon he would be the top military man in the country".|$|E
2500|$|Frazier won the MVP {{award for}} his 34-18 victory in the East-West Shrine Game, nationally {{televised}} on ESPN on January 13, 1996. West Coach Terry Donahue {{said there was no}} doubt that Frazier's performance had improved his standing in regards to the NFL draft. [...] "I think <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> with all kinds of doubts...this game really helped him and somebody is going to invest in him. I am really high on him. [...] When I did the Fiesta Bowl, I said the guy was the most dangerous player in college football and I mean it more now. This guy's dangerous. He's great."

2500|$|Joseph M. Smoot hitched a {{ride from}} lawyer Hank Greenspun {{to get from}} New York City in the eastern United States to Las Vegas. He claimed to have helped build tracks in California and Florida {{which turned out to}} be untrue. The track was built to be a major horse racing {{facility}} on the south side of Las Vegas. Smoot funded the track by convincing 8000 shareholders to give him $2 million. [...] "Old Joe knew a track wouldn't have a chance and he said so when <b>he</b> <b>came</b> <b>here</b> in 1946," [...] Greenspun later said in his biography. After the construction was delayed well past its original opening date, Smoot published an apology in a local newspaper. Smoot and two others were charged with felony embezzlement after he could not provide receipts for missing $500,000. A trustee was appointed by a federal judge to run the track. Smoot remained indicted until he was found dead in a hotel room two years later.|$|E
