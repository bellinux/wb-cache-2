5|$|Though seldom life-threatening, the {{electric}} discharge of an Atlantic torpedo is quite severe {{and may be}} enough to knock a person unconscious. However, a greater danger to divers is the disorientation that follows the shock. The Atlantic torpedo is of no commercial value, as its meat is flabby and tasteless. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. When caught at sea, it is generally discarded or cut up for bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient; it could be negatively affected by <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality,</b> though specific data on catch rates and population trends are lacking, {{as well as by}} the degradation of coral reefs that are important to juveniles. Its slow reproductive rate would limit its capacity to recover from population depletion.|$|E
25|$|A model {{proposed}} in 2010 for predicting acceptable levels of fishing is the Harvest Control Rule (HCR), {{which is a}} set of tools and protocols with which management has some direct control of harvest rates and strategies in relation to predicting stock status, and long-term maximum sustainable yields. Constant catch and constant <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> are two types of simple harvest control rules.|$|E

The precautionary approach it prescribes is typically implemented in concrete management rules as minimum spawning biomass, maximum <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> rates, etc. In 2005 the UBC Fisheries Centre at the University of British Columbia comprehensively reviewed the performance of the world's major fishing nations against the Code.|$|E

25|$|Growth {{overfishing}} {{occurs when}} fish are harvested {{at an average}} size that is smaller than the size that would produce the maximum yield per recruit. A recruit is an individual that makes it to maturity, or into the limits specified by a fishery, which are usually size or age. This makes the total yield less {{than it would be}} if the fish were allowed to grow to an appropriate size. It can be countered by reducing <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> to lower levels and increasing the average size of harvested fish to a size that will allow maximum yield per recruit.|$|E
500|$|Quite common {{within its}} range, the leopard {{catshark}} is harmless to humans. It {{is a popular}} subject of public aquariums because of its small size, attractive appearance, and hardiness. The aquarium trade supports a minor fishery that targets the two Poroderma species. This shark is regularly caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fishers, and almost invariably discarded despite being edible. Nevertheless, <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> {{is likely to be}} high as many fishers using line gear make a point to kill hooked sharks, seeing them as pests that [...] "steal" [...] bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient information to assess the leopard catshark beyond Data Deficient, though notes that its inshore habitat is heavily fished and otherwise impacted by human activity. The possible distribution of this shark across many small, distinct populations also warrants additional investigation and monitoring.|$|E
500|$|The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has {{assessed}} the leopard shark as of Least Concern. It is highly susceptible to local depletion {{due to its}} slow growth rate and low level of exchange between regional stocks. It was considered for, but is not managed under, the U.S. Pacific Fishery Management Council's (PMC) 1982 Groundfish Management Plan. In 1992, the State of California imposed a recreational minimum size limit of [...] and a possession limit of three fish, a move that was strongly supported and promoted by the sport fishing community. In 1993, the State also instituted a minimum size limit of [...] for the commercial harvesting of all sharks and rays, including for the aquarium trade. In addition, Californian restrictions {{on the use of}} certain types of fishing gear in near-shore waters confer good protection to this shark's core population. These management measures seem to have successfully reduced <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> and halted the population decline from the 1980s; the status of the leopard shark off California is regarded as secure, with demographic models estimating an annual population increase of 3ndash&6% with sustainable fishing.|$|E

500|$|As one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} and widely distributed sharks on Earth, the silky shark was once thought to be mostly immune to depletion despite heavy <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality.</b> In 1989 alone, some 900,000 individuals were taken as bycatch in the southern and central Pacific tuna longline fishery, seemingly without effect on the total population. Fishery data on this shark are often confounded by under-reporting, lack of species-level separation, and problematic identification. Nevertheless, mounting evidence indicates the silky shark has, in fact, declined substantially worldwide, a consequence of its modest reproductive rate which is unable to sustain such high levels of exploitation. The total annual catch reported to the Food and Agricultural Organization fell steadily from 11,680tons [...] in 2000 to 4,358tons in 2004. Regional assessments have found similar trends, estimating declines of some 90% in the central Pacific from the 1950s to the 1990s, 60% off Costa Rica from 1991to2000, 91% in the Gulf of Mexico from the 1950s to the 1990s, and 85% (for all large requiem sharks) in the northwestern Atlantic from 1986to2005. The silky shark fishery off Sri Lanka reported a drop from a peak catch of 25,400tons in 1994 to only 1,960tons in 2006, indicative of a local stock collapse. However, Japanese fisheries in the Pacific and Indian Oceans have recorded no change in catch rate between the 1970s and the 1990s, and the validity of the methodologies used to assess declines in the Gulf of Mexico and the northwestern Atlantic have come under much debate.|$|E

Though the concentration of chlorophyll was slightly higher than normal, no visible colour change was noticed in the Bay water. The possible entry of land drainage along with freshwater influx might have caused lower salinity and higher algal concentration. Analysis of water and dead fish tissue samples were carried out for metal load. The concentration of trace metals within safe limits ruled out the possibilities of <b>fish</b> <b>mortality</b> due to metal pollution. The estimated mean value of ammonia (1. 09 mg.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 2000s the European Union {{introduced}} a Cod Recovery Plan which covers the North Sea (incl. the Eastern English Channel and the Kattegat), the Irish Sea and waters to the West of Scotland where cod {{has continued to}} decline. It is broadly accepted that the plan has been a failure and has not delivered its objective of recovering the cod stocks in these areas because of the plan’s over reliance on effort (days-at-sea) that created an indiscriminate ‘race to fish’ which in fact increased <b>fishing</b> <b>mortality</b> on the biomass for cod, on other demersal species and had a destructive impact on the benthic zone of the seabed where it is intensely fished. [...] On the other hand, conservation initiatives undertaken by fishermen working in cooperation with government, such catch-quota management, have made a very meaningful contribution to the recovery of cod in the central and northern North Sea. [...] The biomass of cod in the Irish Sea and West of Scotland remains depleted. [...] A temporary cod plan that excludes a days-at-sea regime will apply from 1 January 2017 before this is superseded by new multi-species plans for individual sea basins; e.g. the North Sea multi-annual plan which was proposed by the European Commission in August 2016.|$|E

SSBcurr stands for the current spawning stock biomass, SSBmsy is the amount of spawning stock biomass needed to produce the maximum sustainable yield, and MSST is the minimum standing stock threshold. The amount that is available to be harvested is controlled by the benchmarks MSY and OY. MSY is the maximum sustainable yield and OY is the optimum yield of a stock. The main difference between MSY and OY is that MSY considers only the biology of the fish while the OY considers the economic aspect of the harvest.|$|E
