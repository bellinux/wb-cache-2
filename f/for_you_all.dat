5|$|Matters were {{complicated}} by mass illnesses spreading across London; the epidemic, probably flu, {{reduced the number}} of actors able to work and many plays were cancelled. Even Henry Fielding's play The Miser, which was to open early January, was postponed because of the poor health of its cast members, including Theophilus. The Miser was eventually staged in mid February and was successful, but another of his plays, Deborah: or, a Wife <b>for</b> <b>You</b> <b>All,</b> lasted only one night on 6 April 1733. Regardless of the problems plaguing the season, it was positive for Fielding while it lasted, with six of his plays being produced on stage along with Thomas Arne's The Opera of Operas, Fielding's Tom Thumb set to music.|$|E

25|$|The {{specificity}} of bird calls {{has been used}} extensively for species identification. The calls of birds have been described using words or nonsense syllables or line diagrams. Common terms in English include words such as quack, chirp and chirrup. These are subject to imagination and vary greatly; a well-known example is the white-throated sparrow's song, given in Canada as O sweet Canada Canada Canada and in New England as Old Sam Peabody Peabody Peabody (also Where are you Frederick Frederick Frederick?). In addition to nonsense words, grammatically correct phrases have been constructed as likenesses of the vocalizations of birds. For example, the barred owl produces a motif which some bird guides describe as Who cooks for you? Who cooks <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>all?</b> with the emphasis placed on you.|$|E

500|$|We've Come <b>for</b> <b>You</b> <b>All</b> {{received}} positive reviews upon release, with About.com crediting it for [...] "getting {{the band}} back on track". Allmusic's Johnny Loftus noted the album for its [...] "pile-driving thrash" [...] sound, which {{reminded him of}} the group's earlier days. Loftus concluded that We've Come <b>for</b> <b>You</b> <b>All</b> was the definitive thrash metal album, released in a period when albums from that genre were not common. In a review for Raidió Teilifís Éireann, Harry Guerin wrote that the band has preserved their sense of melody and aggression. He praised the fast blast beat percussion on [...] "Black Dahlia", and finished the review by saying that the album would likely exceed the expectations of their most devoted fans.|$|E
500|$|Writing for Metal Review, Gregory Bradley {{stopped short}} of calling the album a return to form, but {{asserted}} that the record was an [...] "acceptable" [...] release. Bradley did, however, credit the album for having some [...] "very metal" [...] songs, singling out [...] "What Doesn't Die" [...] and [...] "Black Dahlia" [...] in particular. Chris Ayers from Exclaim! opined that We've Come <b>for</b> <b>You</b> <b>All</b> was the band's strongest release since Sound Of White Noise (1993) and easily {{the best of the}} John Bush era: [...] "Grittier and more confident, the self-produced We've Come <b>for</b> <b>You</b> <b>All</b> is a certified classic that proves the ageless Anthrax are still a viable metal option." [...] Vik Bansal, of MusicOMH, summarized the album as [...] "a bold, sleek and raucous slab of modern metal", containing elements that were absent from many heavy metal albums at the time. Bansal cited [...] "What Doesn't Die" [...] for particular praise, noting the [...] "razor-sharp" [...] riffs on the song. He noted [...] "Cadillac Rock Box" [...] for sounding similar to bands like Lynyrd Skynyrd and Black Sabbath. Bansal summed up his review by stating that We've Come <b>for</b> <b>You</b> <b>All</b> is a [...] "mighty album from a still mighty band".|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} positive reviews {{by contemporary}} music critics, with About.com crediting it for [...] "getting the band back on track".

500|$|Critical {{reception}} of the album was generally positive. AllMusic's Greg Prato noted {{that in spite of}} the issues surrounding the departure of Dan Nelson, the album fits together [...] "seamlessly" [...] and called it the group's finest studio recording since Persistence of Time (1990). Jason Heller of The A.V. Club praised the album for being rid of the [...] "nü-metal stench" [...] of the previous record and the [...] "all-around patchiness" [...] from the other John Bush-era albums. Heller noted that it brought the band back into the [...] "youthful dynamic". Classic Rock journalist Malcolm Dome observed that musically, Worship Music is a mixture of [...] "the grinding power" [...] of We've Come <b>for</b> <b>You</b> <b>All</b> and the more [...] "clear-cut melodic approach" [...] of Among The Living (1987), resulting in an album that is [...] "violently metallic yet sophisticated".|$|E
500|$|Stroheim favored [...] "Soviet-style" [...] montage editing. Greed often uses {{dramatic}} close-ups {{and cuts}} instead of long takes. One {{exception to this}} is the scene in which Schouler becomes angry with McTeague and breaks his pipe, which was shot in one long, unbroken take. Stroheim also used symbolic cross-cutting for dramatic effect, such as his use of animals in the film and a shot of a train when McTeague and Trina first kiss. In 1932 film theorist Andrew Buchanan called Stroheim a montage director, stating that [...] "each observation would be captured in a 'close-up' and at leisure, he would assemble his 'shots' in just the order which would most forcibly illustrate the fact." [...] In the 1950s film critic André Bazin praised Stroheim's use of mise en scène and noted his [...] "one simple rule for directing. Take {{a close look at}} the world, keep on doing so and in the end it will lay bare <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>all</b> its cruelty and ugliness." ...|$|E

500|$|Johnny Loftus from AllMusic {{described}} the {{music as a}} strained fusion of thrash and traditional heavy metal, accompanied by the harsh vocals of Bush. He noted the record for using modern production techniques, as well as displaying melodies and instrumentation that have always been Anthrax's trademark. Magazine Rock Hard observed that the record {{was a combination of}} [...] "tradition and modernity", with strong vocals and [...] "thrashy" [...] tunes. They pointed that the sound was extremely complex with [...] "super fat" [...] production, having nothing similar with the nu metal sound of the early 2000s. Exclaim! wrote that the songs had rock-based structures, unlike the band's earlier releases which featured [...] "brutal beats and razor riffs". Gregory Bradley also noted that couple of songs had [...] "distinct hard-rock vibe", while others demonstrated [...] "very metal" [...] sound. In their guide to Anthrax discography, Kerrang! wrote that We've Come <b>for</b> <b>You</b> <b>All</b> was [...] "leaning towards a groove-orientated hard rock sound" [...] with several slower and radio friendly efforts.|$|E
500|$|However, when McDonald {{reassembled}} {{the band}} for a last-minute scheduling at the Woodstock Festival, another personnel change {{resulted in the}} group's final lineup, which included recruits Mark Kapner on keyboards, Doug Metzner on bass, and Greg Dewey on drums. Among the festival's most memorable moments was McDonald's unexpected solo performance on August 16, 1969, which included [...] "The Fuck Cheer" [...] as a finale. The audience receptively responded by chanting along with McDonald. McDonald's rendition of [...] "The Fuck Cheer" [...] propelled the song into the mainstream culture in the U.S., and was featured on the Woodstock film, which was released on March 26, 1970. Radio stations regularly played both versions of the cheer, though the opposition to [...] "The Fuck Cheer" [...] limited its exposure to underground stations. In December 1969, McDonald began his own career outside the band, releasing cover versions of Guthrie-penned songs on Thinking of Woody Guthrie, and country standards on Tonight I'm Singing Just <b>For</b> <b>You.</b> <b>All</b> the while, the group looked {{to capitalize on the}} momentum from Woodstock and their appearance in the film, Zachariah, by releasing their fifth album, CJ Fish, in May 1970. The album was a moderate success, reaching number 111 nationally. However the band members lacked the motivation for touring and recording, which led to their disbandment in mid-1970.|$|E
