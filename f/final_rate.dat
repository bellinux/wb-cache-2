25|$|Lindsay’s 606 runs in {{the series}} remains the record for a wicketkeeper. Accurate figures for his overall run-rate are unavailable, but {{according}} to R.S. Whitington, {{at the end of}} the second day of the Fourth Test Lindsay had made 585 {{runs in the}} series off 816 balls, which is a rate of 71 runs per 100 balls, so it is reasonable to assume that his <b>final</b> <b>rate</b> for the series was at least 70. Overall series run-rates for the two sides were 47 per 100 balls for South Africa (43 per 100 apart from Lindsay), 40 per 100 balls for Australia; his scoring rate was therefore 50 per cent higher than the series average.|$|E

50|$|The berries are {{eaten by}} wildlife, {{such as the}} lizard Liolaemus belii. Research has shown the seeds are adapted to {{digestion}} as both germination speed and total <b>final</b> <b>rate</b> are higher after passing through the gut, and this is possibly caused by abbration of a waxy layer from the seed in the gut. This does not only lead to dispersal over a wider area, but also do these lizards fecate often on bare soil, which improves the chances of survival of the seedlings.|$|E
50|$|The shorter guard {{interval}} {{results in}} a higher packet error rate when the delay spread of the channel exceed the guard interval and/or if timing synchronization between the transmitter and receiver is not precise. A scheme could be developed to work out whether a short guard interval would be of benefit to a particular link. To reduce complexity, manufacturers typically only implement a short guard interval as a <b>final</b> <b>rate</b> adaptation step when the device is running at its highest data rate.|$|E

50|$|Great Britain: Dog {{licensing}} was abolished in 1987. Prior to {{this dog}} licences were mandatory, but the requirement was widely ignored, with {{only about half}} of owners having one. The <b>final</b> <b>rate</b> for a dog licence was 37 pence, reduced from 37½p when the halfpenny was withdrawn in 1984. This figure was an exact conversion from 7/6 (seven shillings and sixpence) on decimalisation in 1971. The revenue went to local authorities. From 2016 it is a requirement that all dogs in England have a microchip.|$|E
5000|$|A second-order filter attenuates high {{frequencies}} more steeply. The Bode plot {{for this type}} of filter resembles that of a first-order filter, except that it falls off more quickly. For example, a second-order Butterworth filter reduces the signal amplitude to one fourth its original level every time the frequency doubles (so power decreases by 12 dB per octave, or 40 dB per decade). Other all-pole second-order filters may roll off at different rates initially depending on their Q factor, but approach the same <b>final</b> <b>rate</b> of 12 dB per octave; as with the first-order filters, zeroes in the transfer function can change the high-frequency asymptote. See RLC circuit.|$|E

5000|$|The {{capital gains}} tax raises money for {{government}} but penalizes investment (by reducing the <b>final</b> <b>rate</b> of return). Proposals to change the tax rate from the current rate are accompanied by predictions on how it will affect both results. For example, an increase of the tax rate would {{be more of a}} disincentive to invest in assets, but would seem to raise more money for government. However, the Laffer curve suggests that the revenue increase might not be linear and might even be a decrease, as Laffer's [...] "economic effect" [...] begins to outweigh the [...] "arithmetic effect." [...] For example, a 10% rate increase (such as from 20% to 22%) might raise less than 10% additional tax revenue by inhibiting some transactions. Laffer postulated that a 100% tax rate results in no tax revenue.|$|E
40|$|Two {{groups of}} pigeons {{received}} daily discrimination training at two values on a line-tilt continuum. S+ (VI 1) and S− (EXT) intervals alternated, and a 30 -sec criterion of no responding to S− was required before S+ returned. Rates {{of responding to}} S+ showed two separate contrast effects: at an intermediate stage of training a high peak rate appeared which declined, later in training, to a stable level still {{in excess of the}} VI baseline rate. The peak rate was correlated with the total number of responses to S−, while the <b>final</b> <b>rate</b> was not; suggesting that the peak rate and <b>final</b> <b>rate</b> may not be functions of the same variable. These results were compared with performance on a red-green discrimination where the two stages were not so clear. A line-tilt discrimination was repeated with fixed length S− intervals terminated by TO, and showed the same contrast magnitude in the <b>final</b> <b>rate</b> without any peak. The peak rate was interpreted as an effect of the `punishment' contingency where responding to S− prolongs S− for 30 sec, while the <b>final</b> <b>rate</b> was taken to be analogous to previous demonstrations of contrast...|$|E

40|$|Two liquid {{crystalline}} aromatic polyesters {{were studied}} by isothermal degradation techniques. Both polymers contain a common phenyl side chain group. However, one contains a styryl side chain {{and the other}} contains an a-methylstyryl side chain. Isothermal degradations under nitrogen and air were carried on both polymers. From the GC/MS analysis of the cold traps, it showed that both polymers gave off benzene or oxygenated benzene related products. Homopolymers containing only phenyl or a-methylstyryl side chain were prepared by solution polymerization techniques. Then isothermal degradation under air were also carried out on both homopolymers. The GC/MS analysis showed that the a-methylstyryl side chain {{was responsible for the}} formation of the oxygenated benzene products. The activation energies determined for the polyesters did not show the relative stability of the polyesters as expected. Solution polymerized polyester 6 was studied initially under both air and nitrogen atmospheres using the Perkin-Elmer TGS- 2 TGA. For polyester 6 under nitrogen, the activation energy (Eg) was determined to be 43 kcal/mole. Polyester 6 under air, the Ea determined were 31 kcal/mole for the initial rate and 28 kcal/mole for the <b>final</b> <b>rate.</b> Then using the Seiko thermal instrumentation, all of the polyesters were studied under flowing air. The Eafor polyester 6 was determined to be 22 kcal/mole for the initial rate and 12 kcal/mole for the <b>final</b> <b>rate.</b> Solution polymerized polyester 7 had calculated Eaof 36 kcal/mole. Melt polymerized polyester 7 had calculated Eaof 14 kcal/mole for the initial rate and 11 kcal/mole for the <b>final</b> <b>rate.</b> Solution polymerized polyester 8 had calculated Eaof 16 kcal/mole for the initial rate and 12 kcal/mole for the <b>final</b> <b>rate.</b> Solution polymerized polyester 9 had calculated Eaof 20 kcal/mole for the initial rate and 16 kcal/mole for the <b>final</b> <b>rate...</b>|$|E

40|$|Growth of photoheterotrophic tobacco cells (Nicotiana tabacum L. var. "Samsun") in {{suspension}} cultures is inhibited {{in the presence}} of 0. 8 mM L-cysteine as sole sulfur source, when inoculated at densities up to 9. 5 mg dry weight. Under these conditions, hydrogen sulfide is emitted in amounts increasing with increasing inoculation densities. An inoculum of 19 mg dry weight, however, enables a moderate growth of the cells (doubling time 178 h) while reducing the emission of hydrogen sulfide. Feeding of 0. 4 mM L-leucine to the suspension did not only reduce hydrogen sulfide emission at all inoculation densities applied; it also caused exponential growth (doubling time 110 h) at inoculation densities of 9. 5 mg and upwards. Initial and <b>final</b> <b>rate</b> of growth of tobacco cells supplied with L-cysteine as sulfur source increased, hydrogen sulfide emission decreased with increasing L-leucine concentrations in the medium. These effects are not specific for L-leucine, but are also observed when L-is oleucine, L-threonine, or L-valine were added to the suspensions. Support of growth and suppression of hydrogen sulfide emission by L-leucine is accompanied by a reduction of the initial as well as the <b>final</b> <b>rate</b> of uptake of L-cysteine by the cells.
