40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a monocular vision framework enabling feature-oriented appearance-based navigation in large outdoor environments containing other moving objects. The framework {{is based on}} a hybrid topological-geometrical environment representation, constructed from a learning sequence acquired during a robot motion under human control. The framework achieves the desired navigation functionality without requiring a global geometrical consistency of the underlying environment representation. The main advantages with respect to conventional alternatives are unlimited scalability, real-time mapping and effortless dealing with <b>interconnected</b> <b>environments</b> once the loops have been properly detected. The framework has been validated in demanding, cluttered and <b>interconnected</b> <b>environments,</b> under different imaging conditions. The experiments have been performed on many long sequences acquired from moving cars, as well as in real-time large-scale navigation trials relying exclusively on a single perspective camera. The obtained results imply that a globally consistent geometric environment model is not mandatory for successful vision-based outdoor navigation. ...|$|R

Even if this approach cannot totally replace the need of real user trials, it can speed up the implementation of prototypes, decou-pling software from hardware.

40|$|Abstract – Ambient {{intelligence}} {{has been gaining}} a lot of momentum in recent years due to the unprecedented potential it can bring by achieving a ubiquitous, inconspicuous, and interconnected technological surroundings that are sensitive, adaptive, and responsive {{to the presence of}} humans. Multimedia management including its creation, annotation, storage, sharing, retrieval and delivery in such a distributed and <b>interconnected</b> <b>environment,</b> is a challenging task to perform. The challenge stems primarily from the heterogeneity of multimedia data that need to be managed and delivered while taking into consideration the context of users, devices, networks, and surrounding environments. In this paper, we first state the requirements of an ambient intelligence environment and keeping these requirements in mind, propose a multimedia management framework. We describe the several activities of multimedia management, its related issues, and provide the architecture of the proposed framework. A prototype application is developed that handles the capturing, storage, retrieval and delivery of multimedia data. Finally, we present some experimental results and outline future works in this direction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract In {{view that}} {{authentication}} {{has made a}} significant determinant in handover delay, this paper presents a fast authentication mechanism for mobile stations roaming within a WiMAX–WLAN <b>interconnected</b> <b>environment.</b> Incorporating a key reuse design that pre-vents repeated transactions at a remote server, our mechanism distributes security contexts ahead of handover to a local trusted key holder which manages several sites. A target site, upon receiving a mobile station, retrieves the contexts locally for authentication purpose and thus completes handover efficiently. While employing a target prediction algorithm as an option, our mechanism distributes the contexts to target candidates as dictated, which further improves handover performance if target prediction hits and maintains its advantage even in a miss. In addition, the handover optimization design specified in WiMAX is extended to support WiFi-to-WiMAX handovers. We reason that the proposed mechanism does not com-promise the system in any sense as well. Analytical and simulation results show that, despite key pre-distribution misses, our mechanism leads to marked improvement over counterpart schemes in terms of handover delay and packet loss, meeting delay-sensitive application requirements...|$|E
