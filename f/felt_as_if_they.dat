25|$|Police {{brutality}} {{is measured}} {{based on the}} accounts {{of people who have}} experienced or seen it, as well as the juries who are present for trials involving police brutality cases. This is because {{there is no way to}} quantify the use of excessive force for any particular situation. Because police brutality is relative to a situation, it depends on if the suspected person(s) is(are) resisting. Out of the people who were surveyed about their account with the police brutality in 2008, only about 12% <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had been resisting. Although police force itself cannot be quantified, the opinion of brutality among various races, genders, and ages can. African Americans, women, and younger people are more likely to have negative opinions about police than Caucasians, men, and middle-aged to elderly individuals.|$|E
500|$|With a {{past as a}} musician, I {{remember}} sometimes {{feeling like}} the audience was against me while I was on stage [...] Even if that wasn't noticeable in any way, I still <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> all disliked me, or at least, misunderstood me, deep inside. That paranoia was kind of firmly rooted inside of me—the fear of being the wrong artist {{in front of the}} wrong audience. Thus, the idea for 'She's Madonna' deals with that.|$|E
500|$|The {{earthquake}} made Yamaguchi rethink {{his reasons}} why Sakanaction make music. The {{meaning of a}} documentary-themed album changed after the earthquake, as the band <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> {{did not have a}} heavy album that reflected these events, then it could not truly be a documentary. Yamaguchi wrote the songs [...] "Bach no Senritsu o Yoru ni Kiita Sei Desu" [...] and [...] "Years" [...] directly after the earthquake, as therapy for himself. Realizing that rock bands were no longer a staple of Japanese charts in the early 2010s, Yamaguchi wanted to create a Sakanaction-style pop song that would resonate with a general pop audience, one that listened to idol groups such as Girls' Generation, TVXQ and AKB48. As rock music was no longer so prominent in Japan, Yamaguchi felt that the reasons for people listening to music had changed over time, and wanted to mix rock music with entertainment-focused music in order to give people music that they look for.|$|E

The roof was, {{for the most}} part, less than ten feet high, so the boys <b>felt</b> just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were [...] "walking between big pie crusts," [...] as Roger quaintly expressed it. The cave seemed to be dry, although when they stopped once more to look around, they heard the distant gurgle of a stream of water.|$|R

She had never before heard an oath, but there came back from these men coarse, brutal tones and words of blasphemy that froze her blood with horror. And Moses was going with them! She <b>felt</b> somehow <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> must be a company of fiends bearing him to his ruin.|$|R

Even so, a source detailed snowfall depths of [...] within the vicinity of Lunenburg {{by the time the}} hurricane's precipitation subsided, and reported higher depths of [...] in other regions of the state. In the vicinity of Windsor, up to [...] of snow may have fallen {{during the course of the}} snowstorm. The snow was deep enough to cover the entire heights of corn stalks and potato crops, impeding the impending harvest, while massive drifts in the state's hills obstructed roads. Even farther north in Maine, the snowstorm's effects remained disastrous; following its passage, a [...] timber lot at Thomaston was nearly entirely uprooted, clearing a massive forested area and making towns from great distances away, previously obstructed, suddenly visible. The effect of the storm was so pronounced that, according to Sidney Perley, [...] "people <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were in a strange place". The storm was particularly severe on the Atlantic coast, especially in Kennebec, Wiscaset, Berwick, Kittery, and York, causing moderate destruction and killing several cattle. However, at Portland, the hurricane was less severe and its impact was minimal. Precipitation arrived in Canada on 9October and persisted through the following day without triggering any recorded damage.|$|E
500|$|After {{recording}} vocals for Steven Van Zandt's anti-apartheid project Sun City in August 1985, Bono made {{an additional}} {{contribution to the}} album in October that was inspired by his burgeoning interest in roots music. While in New York, he spent time with musicians Keith Richards and Mick Jagger, who played him blues and country music. Bono was embarrassed by his lack of familiarity with the genres, as most of U2's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid-1970s. He realised that U2 [...] "had no tradition" [...] and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> [...] "were from outer space". This inspired him to write the blues-influenced song [...] "Silver and Gold", which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood and convinced Van Zandt to add to Sun City. Until that time, U2 had been apathetic towards roots music, but after spending time with the Waterboys and fellow Irish band Hothouse Flowers, they {{felt a sense of}} indigenous Irish music blending with American folk music. Nascent friendships with Bob Dylan, Van Morrison and Richards encouraged Bono to look back to rock's roots and to focus on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist. He explained, [...] "I used to think that writing words was old-fashioned, so I sketched. I wrote words on the microphone. For The Joshua Tree, I felt {{the time had come to}} write words that meant something, out of my experience." [...] Dylan told Bono of his own debt to Irish music, while Bono further demonstrated his interest in music traditions in his duet with Irish Celtic and folk group Clannad on the track [...] "In a Lifetime".|$|E
500|$|... "Silver and Gold" [...] {{was written}} {{in support of the}} Artists United Against Apartheid project, which protested the South African apartheid. In 1985, Bono participated in Steven Van Zandt's anti-apartheid Sun City project and spent time with Keith Richards and Mick Jagger of The Rolling Stones. When Richards and Jagger played blues, Bono was embarrassed by his lack of {{familiarity}} with the genre, as most of U2's musical knowledge began with punk rock in their youth in the mid-1970s. Bono realised that U2 [...] "had no tradition", and he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> [...] "were from outer space". This inspired him to write the blues-influenced song [...] "Silver and Gold", which he recorded with Richards and Ronnie Wood. It was re-recorded by U2 for the [...] "Where the Streets Have No Name" [...] single while the band returned to Dublin during in May 1987 during a break {{between the first and second}} legs of The Joshua Tree Tour. The song was described by Musician as [...] "tough and raw, with Bono in husky and confident voice, underpinned by a sinuous bass line, and with The Edge demonstrating his newfound prowess in blues-based guitar." [...] "Silver and Gold" [...] was played live on The Joshua Tree Tour several times, one performance of which was featured on the band's 1988 album and rockumentary, Rattle and Hum. Both the studio recording and the Sun City versions were later featured on the bonus disc of the 20th anniversary edition of The Joshua Tree. The studio version was also included on the limited edition B-sides bonus disk of the band's first compilation album, The Best of 1980–1990.|$|E

It was all exquisite, though rather tiny; {{but such}} luxury {{was as far}} removed from the dingy rooms they had {{occupied}} as could well be imagined. The Major coughed and ahemmed continually; Patsy ah'd and oh'd and seemed half frightened; Uncle John walked after them silently, but with a pleased smile that was almost childish upon his round and rugged face.|$|R
60|$|Any how, I {{sat with}} my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand, {{looking into the}} fire, as those two talked about my going away, and about {{what they should do}} without me, and all that. And {{whenever}} I caught one of them looking at me, though never so pleasantly (and they often looked at me,--particularly Biddy), I <b>felt</b> offended: <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were expressing some mistrust of me. Though Heaven knows they never did by word or sign.|$|R

500|$|Deus Ex Go {{follows the}} premise behind Square Enix Montreal's {{previous}} Go mobile series titles—Lara Croft Go (2015) and Hitman Go (2014)—in distilling {{the essence of}} the series' core gameplay for turn- and touchscreen-based puzzles. The Deus Ex Go development team was split between employees who had worked on [...] and those who had worked on the Go series. Their combination was expected to resolve philosophical differences between the teams stemming from indie and AAA traditions of game development and pricing. Throughout development, the team asked themselves whether the Go elements <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> belonged to the Deus Ex series. The team sampled several kinds of hacking mechanics before deciding to use terminals that modified each puzzle rather than performing single-use instrumental kills. They also decided to add a narrative—the first in the Go series—drawing from its importance in the main series. Several elements from the series did not translate well to mobile, such as player choice, which had too many possibilities to suit the game's puzzle-solving. The team also invested in tools that made puzzle construction easier. Prior games took three months to make 25 puzzles, while Deus Ex Go tool nearly tripled their output. As a result, the team planned post-release puzzles and a tool for players to create their own. This new puzzle design mode released, as planned, two months after the game's launch. Designer Étienne Giroux compared their choice to release a new daily puzzle with progressive difficulty peaking on Fridays to the regularity of The New York Times crossword puzzles. Square Enix said that the game's puzzles were more difficult than those of previous games, and unlike the prior two Go games, Deus Ex Go uses a hexagonal grid instead of squares. Square Enix announced Deus Ex Go at a press event in advance of the June 2016 Electronic Entertainment Expo. It was released on August 18, 2016, for Android and iOS platforms on both phones and tablets. The game was later ported to Windows and Windows 10 Mobile, and the team later released a documentary video on their development process.|$|E

60|$|On {{the third}} morning after their {{arrival at the}} toll-gate the captain and Olive ventured upon a little walk over the farm. It was very hard upon both {{of them to be}} shut up in the house so long. They saw no reporters, nor were there any men with cameras, but the scenery was not pleasant, nor was the air {{particularly}} exhilarating. They were not happy; <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> alone, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> were in a strange place. Some of the captain's friends in the town came to the toll-gate, but there were not many, and Olive saw none of them. The whole situation reminded the girl of the death of her mother.|$|R
60|$|Friesshardt and Leuthold lay on {{the ground}} beside the pole, feeling very sore and bruised, and thought that perhaps, on the whole, they had better stay there. There was no knowing what the crowd might do after this, <b>if</b> <b>they</b> began to fight again. So they {{lay on the}} ground and made no attempt to {{interfere}} with the popular rejoicings. What they wanted, as Arnold of Sewa might have said if he had been there, was a few moments' complete rest. Leuthold's helmet had been hammered with sticks until it was over his eyes and all out of shape, and Friesshardt's was very little better. And <b>they</b> both <b>felt</b> just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had been run over in the street by a horse and cart.|$|R

60|$|Victoria, by {{the grace}} of God, of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, Queen, Defender of the Faith, remarked {{abruptly}} to Frank Crosse of Woking, in the county of Surrey, 'We command you that within eight days of the service of this writ on you, inclusive of the day of such service, you cause an appearance to be entered for you in an action at the suit of the Hotspur Insurance Company, Limited.' If he didn't do so, Her Majesty remarked that several very unpleasant things might occur, and Hardinge Stanley, Earl of Halsbury, corroborated Her Majesty. Maude was frightened to death when she saw the document, and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> unawares <b>they</b> must have butted up against the British Constitution, but Owen explained that it was only a little legal firework, which meant that there might be some trouble later.|$|R
60|$|Rose {{really did}} have some cause to be sad; for she had no mother, and had lately lost her father also, which left her no home but this with her great-aunts. She had been with them only a week, and, though the dear old ladies had tried their best to make her happy, they had not succeeded very well, for she was unlike any child they had ever seen, and <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> very much <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had {{the care of a}} low-spirited butterfly.|$|R

Wherefore, at last, when the ladies' visit was drawing to a close and the Lord Guilford Dudley was announced, they not only felt that their charge had been sufficiently taxed for the present, but also that they themselves were not in the best condition to take their ship back and make their anxious voyage all over again. So they respectfully advised Tom to excuse himself, which he was very glad to do, although a slight shade of disappointment might have been observed upon my Lady Jane's face when she heard the splendid stripling denied admittance.|$|R

30|$|The {{phenomenon}} of rubber hand illusion was first reported by Botvinick and Cohen (Botvinick & Cohen, 1998) {{in which a}} rubber hand was {{placed in front of}} the participants while their own hands were hidden from sight. As long as there were synchronous touches that existed on both rubber hand and real hand, a perceptual illusion would be felt. Besides recognizing the fake model hand as being part of their own body, participants also reported that <b>they</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the touch <b>they</b> sensed originated from the location on the rubber hand where they saw the brush touching the rubber hand, rather than from their real hand (Makin, Holmes, & Ehrsson, 2008). Furthermore, recent studies show below rubber hand illusion implicate that the brain is capable of integrating “natural” visual input and direct cortical-somatosensory stimulation to create the multisensory perception that an artificial limb belongs to one’s own body (Tsakiris, 2017; Collins et al. 2017).|$|R

60|$|At last, in a nook {{formed by}} the {{weathered}} joints, Eustace found a rugged niche, somewhat dryer than the rest, and laid Cleer gently down in it, on a natural spring seat of tufted rock-plants. Then he settled down beside her, with what cheerfulness he could muster up, and taking off his wet coat, spread it on top across the cleft, like a tent roof, to shelter them. It was no time, indeed, to stand upon ceremony. Cleer recognized as much, and nestled close to his side, like a sensible girl as she was, so as to keep warm by mere company; while Eustace, still holding her hand, just to assure her of his presence, placed himself in such an attitude, leaning before her and above her, as to protect her {{as far as possible}} from the drizzling rainfall through the gap in front of them. There they sat till morning, talking gradually of many things, and growing more and more confidential, in spite of cold and wet, as they learnt more and more, with each passing hour, of each other's standpoint. There are some situations where you get to know people better in a few half-hours together than you could get to know them in months upon months of mere drawing-room acquaintance. And this was one of them. Before morning dawned, Eustace Le Neve and Cleer Trevennack <b>felt</b> just <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> had known one another quite well for years. They were old and trusted friends already. Old friends--and even something more than that. Though no word of love was spoken between them, each knew of what the other was thinking. Eustace felt Cleer loved him; Cleer felt Eustace loved her. And in spite of rain and cold and fog and darkness they were almost happy--before dawn came to interrupt their strange tete-a-tete on the islet.|$|R
40|$|Researchers {{working in}} the field of gap junctions, the {{membrane}} structures dedicated to direct cell-cell communication, might have <b>felt,</b> at times, <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> are children of a lesser god. The molecular cloning of connexins and their identification as the protein components of gap junctions heralded a new era, but compared to the progress achieved in deciphering other junctional structures, it looked as though cadherin and integrins were sprinting in a fast lane and leaving gap junctions behind. But gap junctions are not simple structures of contact between cells, they are in fact channels formed by the oligomerization of connexins: six connexins make a connexon or hemichannel, and two connexons from adjacent cells align in the extracellular space to make a full intercellular gap junction channel that allows direct communication between cells without using the extracellular space to exchange messages. Compared to classical ion channels, however, studies of intercellular ones have suffered from the lack of clear ionic selectivity and of specific toxins to probe their function. But if these aspects led to a grim mood among researchers, it has disappeared with the discovery that several genetic diseases are linked to mutations in connexin genes. The recent meeting on connexins and gap junctions, attended by {{the vast majority of people}} active in the field, confirmed some of the trends that have emerged and that are allowing us to make sense of the complexity of connexin language, and announced some of the new avenues that are beginning to be explored. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
40|$|We {{all have}} {{memories}} of highly emotional personal and public events {{that may have}} happened some years ago but which are <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> strongly <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> happened yesterday. We remember where they happened, {{the people who were}} with us, and seemingly irrelevant details such as the weather, particular sounds or specific clothes. Why do we remember these things? Is it because such events are so deeply emotional or so unexpected or because people talk about them so many times? Why are these "flashbulb memories" so vivid and lasting? Flashbulb Memories: New Issues and New Perspectives explores these questions in the first book on flashbulb memories (FBMs) for more than a decade. It considers the many developments over the last 10 years, including new models of FBM formation, advances in statistical methods and neuroscience, and two key public events, the death of Princess Diana and the September 11 th attacks in the US, which can help test FBM. The book examines the status of FBMs as "special" or "ordinary" memory formations, and the expert contributors represent a balance between those that favour each approach. It also investigates controversial topics of research such as: Are emotional, cognitive, or social factors highly relevant for the formation of FBMs? How can sociological, historical, and cultural issues help us to understand the process of FBMs? What are the differences between FBMs, memories for traumatic experiences, and highly vivid personal memories? How can we provide a valid and reliable measure for FBMs? This book gathers together specialists in the field in order to make significant progress in this area of research which has remained divisive for the past 30 years. It will provide essential reading for researchers in FBM and also be of interest to those in related areas such as social psychology, cognitive psychology, cross-cultural psychology, sociology, political sciences and history as well as clinicians dealing with those who have strong FBMs after personal traumatic events.
