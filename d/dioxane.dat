This was resolved by an independent systems calculation of the σ - σ* transitions for several of the model sugar compounds. The isolated bond transition energies for the series of bonds CH, OH, NH and CC, CN, CO and CF were calculated both by the extended Huckel method and by the complete neglect of differential overlap (CNDO) method.

Experimental results for hydrocarbons and fluorocarbons indicated that the completely empirical method was the best approximation. The results of an independent systems calculation for the model sugar compounds showed that the low energy transitions were not σ - σ* transitions.

By employing a stoichiometric amount of a commercially available oxoammonium salt, known as “Bobbitt’s salt,” a facile and efficient procedure for the oxidation of primary amines to nitriles has been realized. This methodology was further adapted into an efficient, scalable catalytic process. The use of Oxoneâ as an inexpensive, environmentally benign terminal oxidant allows for the in situ production of an oxoammonium salt, the primary oxidant, from a small quantity of 4 -acetamido- 2, 2, 6, 6 -tetramethylpiperidine-N-oxyl (4 -acetamidoTEMPO or ACT), a nitroxide catalyst, accomplishing the oxidation of primary amines to nitriles. Mechanistic aspects and scope of the oxidations are fully described. A novel oxoammonium salt oxidant has been developed by the electronic modification of “Bobbitt’s salt” and the kinetics of the oxidation of alcohol substrates by these salts has been studied. The second portion of this work involves evaluation of the conformational equilibra found within a variety saturated heterocycles and small molecules with an aim to elucidate the origin of contrasteric effects often observed in such systems.

40|$|M. Sc. (Chemistry) The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the oxidation of aromatic compounds and benzylidene acetals with dimethyldioxinne. Dimethyldioxirane, either by Insitu preparation or in the isolated form, has shown remarkable reactivity. This oxidant is effective in oxygen transfer, readily prepared from commercial materials and reacts under mild conditions. Quinones are natural materials with biological activity and some are key intermediates in the synthesis of medicines. A well-known method for the preparation of quinones, is the oxidation of phenols and aromatic ethers. The oxidation of simple phenol and anisole derivatives by dimethyldioxirane yielded complex mixtures. More hindered aromatic compounds were investigated, since the oxidation of these compounds proceeded in a more controlled manner. In this study the phenols were found to be more reactive than the corresponding aromatic ethers. para-Quinones were formed preferentially, whereas ortho-quinones were observed in one or two cases. Products formed in these oxidations depend on the substitution pattern of the substrate. The oxidation of phenols and aromatic compounds formed complex mixtures and does not have many synthetic applications. Mechanisms are proposed for the formation of the different products. Benzylidene acetals are important protecting groups in the chemistry of carbohydrates. Cleavage of these benzylidene acetals gave either the free diol or benzyl ether or benzoyl ester, depending on the reagent used. The reaction of dimethyldioxirane with benzylidene acetals gave the benzoylesters. With <b>dioxanes,</b> e. g. 4, 6 -O-benzylidene sugar derivatives, there are no difference in stereoelectronic effects in the cleavage of C- 4 and C- 6. The major product has a 6 -benzoate group, probably due to the greater stability of the primary benzoate. In dioxolanes both reactivity and regioselectivity of the reactions are influenced by stereoeleetronic effects. It has been found that the cleavage of dioxolanes took place preferably in a conformation where the oxygen is antiperiplanar towards the leaving group. It has been shown that dimethyldioxinme can be used with success in the deprotection of benzylidene acetals in the chemistry of carbohydrates...|$|R
40|$|Activated carbon {{is widely}} used in the gold {{processing}} industry as an adsorbent for the gold cyanide complex, [Au(CN) (subscript) 2]. However, many other processing reagents are also adsorbed (termed fouling), which compete with the gold cyanide complex for active sites on the carbon. So far {{the only way of}} assessing the amount of fouling due to organic compounds that has adsorbed on the carbon is through the use of thermogravimetry (TG). Unfortunately, thermogravimetry only gives the percentage total of organic fouling agents adsorbed and no information can be obtained on the identity of the individual organic fouling agents. Thus this current work reports the development of analytical methods capable of identifying specific fouling agents. In this thesis the identification of two types of common organic fouling agents adsorbed on activated carbon during gold processing has been established using three thermal analysis techniques, namely thermal desorption-pyrolysis-gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (TD-py-GC-MS), thermogravimetry-mass spectrometry (TG-MS), and thermogravimetry-Fourier transform infrared (TG-FTIR) spectroscopy. TD-py-GC-MS was used to identify the individual decomposition gases of each sample. TG-MS and TG-FTIR were used to obtain the decomposition temperatures of the fouling agents, and to identify/monitor the gases evolved as a function of temperature. All analyses were performed in an inert atmosphere. The organic fouling agents studied were xanthates and frothing agents, which are used as flotation reagents. The xanthates studied were sodium ethyl xanthate (SEX), sodium isobutyl xanthate (SiBX), potassium ethyl xanthate (PEX), and potassium amyl xanthate (PAX). The frothing agents studied were polypropylene glycol (PPG), polypropylene glycol methyl ether (PPGME), alpha-terpineol, and methyl isobutyl carbinol (MiBC). The thermal decomposition of ++each pure reagent was studied, and then the reagents were individually adsorbed on an activated carbon (Haycarb, - 45 mu m) and their thermal decomposition reinvestigated. These pure systems were then compared to the thermal decomposition of activated carbon samples taken from two gold processing plants. Between seven and sixteen gases were identified via TD-py-GC-MS for the decomposition of each xanthate. Common gases and types of gases identified included carbonyl sulfide, carbon disulfide, thiols, alcohols, carbonates, sulfides, disulfides, and carbonothioic acid, O,S, dialkyl esters. The thermogravimetric curve of each xanthate displayed two mass losses. The mass losses and their corresponding temperatures were dependent on the alkyl chain and alkali cation of the xanthate. TG-MS and TG-FTIR showed carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide were the most significant gases evolved from the decomposition of each xanthate. Each xanthate was adsorbed on activated carbon, and its thermal decomposition characteristics reinvestigated. On heating, similar gases were evolved to those detected for the xanthate alone. However, the TG curves displayed three mass losses compared to two with the xanthates not adsorbed on activated carbon. The first mass loss of each sample was attributed to a hydrolysis reaction between water retained in the activated carbon and the xanthate. TG-MS and TG-FTIR analyses showed carbon disulfide and carbonyl sulfide were the most significant gases evolved during the first mass loss and second mass losses respectively, and consequently these gases could be used as indicators of xanthate fouling on plant samples. The TD-Py-GC-MS, TG-MS, and TG-FTIR analyses of the frothing agents showed these compounds mainly boiled with little indication of thermal decomposition. The thermogravimetric curve of each frother displayed one mass loss. Upon reinvestigation of ++the frothing agents individually adsorbed on activated carbon, a number of different gases were identified by the TD-py-GC-MS analyses. For all adsorbed frothing agents (except MiBC) these included propanal, 2 -ethyl- 4 -methyl 1, 3 -dioxolane, 3, 3 -oxybis- 2 -butanol, and <b>dioxanes.</b> Each TG curve displayed one mass loss due to the decomposition of the frothing agent. The TG-MS and TG-FTIR analyses showed propanal was the most significant gas evolved for the PPG and PPGME. For alpha-terpineol, propene was also a significant gas, although this gas was not detected by TG-FTIR. The TD-py-GC-MS and TG-FTIR analyses of the MiBC showed it mainly boiled off the carbon without significant alteration. Four activated carbon samples were obtained from different parts of the process circuit in the Three Mile Hill plant in Western Australia. Nine to twelve gases were identified by TD-py-GC-MS analysis of each sample. Common gases included butene, 2 -methyl-I-butene, and butanol. The TG curve of each sample displayed one mass loss due to the presence of fouling agents. TG-MS analyses showed butene was the most significant gas evolved for this mass loss. TG-FTIR analyses showed that carbonyl sulfide had also evolved during this mass loss. Thus it was concluded from the detection of carbonyl sulfide and its temperature of evolution, that fouling of the activated carbon by a xanthate had occurred. Five activated carbon samples were obtained from the Salsigne plant in France. Nine to fourteen gases were identified by TD-py-GC-MS analysis of each sample. Common gases included cyclopropane, butene, propanal, isobutanol, isoarnyl alcohol, and 2, 5 and 2, 6 -dimethyl dioxene. The TG curve of each sample displayed one mass loss due to the decomposition of fouling agents, in the same temperature region as the Three Mile Hill samples. TG-MS analyses showed cyclopropane was the most significant gas evolved ++for this mass loss. TG-FTIR analyses showed that carbonyl sulfide had also evolved during this mass loss. Thus it was concluded from the detection of propanal, carbonyl sulfide, and their temperatures of evolution that fouling of the activated carbon by a xanthate and a frothing agent had occurred respectively. A comparison of the techniques showed that TD-py-GC-MS analysis was essential for unambiguous identification of the complex gas mixture obtained from decomposition of organic fouling agents. Unfortunately TD-py-GC-MS provided no information on mass losses or temperatures of gas evolution. TG-MS permitted the monitoring of evolved gases versus temperature via their molecular ions. However the molecular ion signals were affected by overlapping fragment and/or isotope ion signals. The TG-FTIR was most useful when the evolved gases gave an infrared adsorption that was very characteristic of the molecule, as for the identification of carbonyl sulfide and carbon disulfide. This work was successful as a combination of the analytical techniques enabled identification of fouling agents adsorbed on plant samples...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] Boston UniversityAryl and/or alkyl {{substitution}} {{of one or}} two of the B-chloroethyl groups of bis or tris-B-chloroethylamine (nitrogen mustards) was shown in 1946 to reduce markedly the toxicity of these substances and to confer new and interesting pharmacologic properties upon the 2 -haloalkylamine grouping. These compounds, of which N, N, dibenzyl-B-chloroethylamine (Dibenamine) was the forerunner (1), possess the ability to block and reverse many of the pharmacologic effects of epinephrine, as well as reduce or abolish the effects mediated over the sympatho-adrenal nervous system. Evidence accumulated indicating that Dibenamine was the most specific, albeit not the most potent, adrenergic blocking drug, as compared to notoriously non-specific and toxic members existing in the same class (ergot derivatives, yohimbine, <b>dioxanes,</b> and so forth. (See (2) for reference and discussion). In 1947 it was shown by Loew (3) and, subsequently by Kerwin,et al. (4), Hunt (5), Henderson, et al. (6), and Nickerson (7), that the dibenzyl radical was not the only aryl substituent which conferred low toxicity and adrenergic blocking properties to the B-chloroethyl group in nitrogen mustards. Hence, alpa-naphthylmethyl, biphenylyloxy, phenylethyl, phenoxy, benzhydryl, and 9 -fluorenyl substituted derivatives were found to be active adrenergic blocking drugs, some homologues of which were far more potent than Dibenamine in this respect. However, certain of these derivatives were found not to be as specific as Dibenamine. Hence, compounds possessing appreciable antihistaminic properties (alpha-naphthyl-methyl and biphenylyloxy derivatives) were described (8); and others proved to be cholinergic (e. g., N, N-dimethyl- 2 -chloro- 2 -phenylethylamine, (9). From the available evidence it appeared that aryl and/or alkyl {{substitution of}} {{one or two of the}} B-chloroethyl groups of the nitrogen mustards altered the toxicity but did not reduce the potential chemical reactiveness inherent in the B-chloroethyl radical (see (10) for discussion of chemical reactivity of nitrogen and sulfur mustards). It was apparent, however, that the nature of the aryl substituent modified this reactiveness of this group so that it became more or less specific. This in turn was reflected in predominant pharmacologic effects of a given derivative, in contrast to the rather wide-spread and manifold pharmacologic effects of the nitrogen mustards (10). Nonetheless, other pharmacologic effects which appear in a given compound are in addition to prominent adrenergic blocking properties; thus most aryl derivatives of B-chloroethylamine which have been described are classified in this category. In view of the possible uses of adrenergic blocking drugs in medicine, and the fundamental usefulness of these drugs in delimiting functions of the sympathetic nervous system, the importance of knowing the specificity and potency of drugs is evident. Aryl derivatives possess desirable properties in that they are long-acting and highly potent and effective. Unfortunately, as pointed out above, not all derivatives appeared as specific as desired and, in addition, specificity among these agents had not yet been placed in quantitative terms. With these points in mind, studies of the specificity of action of some of the more potent and better known aryl-haloalkylamines were made on the isolated seminal vesicle of the guinea pig by the Magnus technique. Specificity of drug action was inferred from the relative concentrations of each adrenergic blocking drug required to inhibit the spasmogenic effects of equi-effective doses of epinephrine, nor-epinephrine, histamine, and acetylcholine, as compared to control contractions made in the absence of the antagonist. The measurement data obtained were converted to all-or-none data by designating that a given trial with an antagonistic drug was a positive trial if the per cent reduction was 50 per cent or greater; any value below this was a negative trial. Thus, small doses of antagonist yielded relatively few positive trials, and increasingly larger doses resulted in greater proportions of positive trials. The data were analyzed statistically by the graphic analysis of Litchfield and Wilcoxon (11) to forecast the relative concentration (in mcg. / 100 cc.) producing 50 per cent or greater inhibition of the spasm induced by the active drug in 50 per cent of the trials (ED 50) and the 95 per cent confidence limits of these estimates. Comparisons of the ED 5 O values obtained with the adrenergic blocking drugs antagonizing epinephrine revealed that N-ethyl-N-(2 -chloroethyl) - 9 -fluorenamine. HCl (Sy- 21, ED 50 Epi = 0. 52) was the most effective antagonist of epinephrine. This was followed in order by: N-ethyl-N-(2 -chloroethyl) benzhydrylamine. HCl (SY- 2, ED 50 Epi = 0. 75); N-ethyl-N-(2 -bromoethyl) -naphthalenemethylamine. HBr (SY- 28, ED 50 Epi = 1. 37); N, N-(2 -chloroethyl) -dibenzylamine. HCl (Dibenamine, ED 50 Epi = 2. 60) and, 2 -(2 -biphenylyloxy) - 2 '-chlorotriethylamine. HCl (SY- 8, ED 50 Epi = 3. 03). As to be expected, atropine sulfate (ED 50 Epi = 1330) and pyranisamine (ED 50 Epi = ca. 12 - 24, 000) were highly ineffective in antagonizing epinephrine under the conditions employed. Comparison of ED 50 Norepi values yielded the same order of potency. The individual values were uniformly less than the corresponding ED 50 Epi. The ED 50 Norepi to ED 5 OEpi ratio was 0. 8 in each case examined and indicates that less drug was required to inhibit nor-epinephrine than an equieffective amount of epinephrine, although the difference was statistically significant in only 2 of the 4 comparisons made. This result suggests that the greater susceptibility to blockade by these drugs of epinephrine pressor effects, as compared to nor-epinephrine. is due to significantly greater vasodilating properties of the former, and not to differences in the amines, per se, or site of action of the pressor agents. Antihistaminic properties, as judged by the ability to reduce histamine spasm, were revealed in all of the aryl-haloalkylamines exrunined. The most potent aryl-haloalkylamine in this respect (SY- 28, ED 50 Hist = 0. 71), however, was far less effective than pyranisamine (Neo-antergan maleate, ED 50 Hist =. 053) tested under the same conditions. The antihistaminic activity of the aryl-haloalkylamines (as was the anti-epinephrine activity) was irreversible (and hence, probably non-competitive) under these conditions since the drugs, once added to the muscle bath, could not be washed from the tissue. The ratio, ED 50 Hist/ED 50 Epi, each from the same antagonist gives some measure of the relative specificity. This ratio, calculated for each antagonist, varied from 44 (SY- 2) to 0. 5 (SY- 28). Hence, the same relatioship that existed between epinephrine and nor-epinephrine (ED 50 Norepi to ED 50 Epi ratio for each antagonist = 0. 8) does not exist between histamine and epinephrine and does not support the concept that epinephrine and histamine act in similar manners or on the same receptors. Comparison of the ratio, ED 50 Hist to ED 50 Epi, revealed that SY- 2 (Ratio = 44) was the most discriminating under these conditions, followed by SY- 21 (20), Dibenamine (13), SY- 8 (2) and SY- 28 (0. 5). The ratio of 0. 5 obtained with SY- 28 indicates that this drug is more effective in antagonizing histamine than epinephrine, and as such, should be classified as an antihistaminic. While the properties of these aryl-haloalkylamines were qualitatively similar with respect to histamine, epinephrine, and nor-epinephrine antagonism, marked differences were apparent with respect to antagonism of acetylcholine. Thus, SY- 2 and Dibenamine, were found to be incapable of blocking acetylcholine-induced spasm in quantities that did not produce spasm themselves (700 to 1400 times the respective ED 50 Epi). SY- 21 potentiated acetylcholine spasm markedly in doses of 500 - 1000 mcg. / 100 cc., quantities in themselves slightly spasmogenic. SY- 28 and SY- 8 were found to block acetylcholine. The concentrations required to do so were much above those of atropine sulfate but only 8 (SY- 8) and 68 (SY- 28) times their respective ED 50 Epi. The blocking properties of SY- 28 and SY- 8 were partially reversible by washing and differ in this respect from anti-epinephrine and anti-histamine activity. The modifying importance of the aryl radical is brought out by these results since the drugs studied differed only in the nature of the aryl radical (all were aryl-ethyl-B-chloroethylamines except Dibenamine [...] an aryl-benzyl-B-chloroethylamine). The results of these experiments revealed that aryl-haloalkylamine adrenergic blocking drugs possess pharmacologic properties other than anti-epinephrine activity, which may approach or overshadow the adrenergic blocking activity. The great pharmacologic potentialities of the B-chloroethylamine group appears to have been rendered more specific by juxtaposition of a suitable aryl radical, although the specificity exhibited does not approach certain other antagonists of different classes (e. g., atropine vs. acetylcholine, and pyranisamine vs. histamine). Finally, two of the most specific drugs, as determined above, were selected and studied in intact animals in order to assess, in some measure, their range of activity and site of action. The method employed was one in which the blocking activity of the drugs against epinephrine and adrenergic reflex pressor responses were obtained in the anesthetized dog by 1) carotid occlusion and 2) anoxia (nitrogen inhalation). In addition, adrenergic effects, manifested as a rise in blood pressure, was induced by injections of nicotine (25 mcg. /kgm., i. v.) acting primarily at the ganglionic level, and epinephrine (1 mcg. /kgm., i. v.) acting at the effector cell level. Both SY- 2 (20 mgm. /kgm., i. v.) and SY- 21 (1. 0 mgm. /kgm., i. v.) reduced, blocked or reversed the adrenergic responses due to carotid occlusion (reduced), anoxia (reversed), nicotine (reversed), and epinephrine (reversed). The data obtained suggested that SY- 21 was more potent than SY- 2, even more so than the differential in doses indicate. The data are interpreted as to suggest that a peripheral site of action is responsible for blockade of all the responses. In addition, no effects were observed, under the conditions employed, that could not be explained as due to peripheral blockade of the sympatho-adrenal nervous system. The experiments support the previous conclusion that SY- 2 and SY- 21 are among the most specific aryl-haloalkylamine adrenergic blocking drugs available...|$|R
