5|$|The elder Roddenberry {{became a}} patrolman, and held that rank {{for the next}} twenty years. The family {{expanded}} {{with the birth of}} Robert Leon Roddenberry in 1924, and Doris Willodean Roddenberry in 1925. During this time, the Roddenberrys bought their first home at 3243 Drew Street. During Gene's early years, he was saved by a quick thinking milkman who noticed that the house was on fire. <b>He</b> <b>pounded</b> on the door until Glen awoke and rushed out of the house with the children in tow. Roddenberry's father kept rabbits, and the children sold them outside the house. It was these animals that became the subject of Roddenberry's first published work in his school's twice-yearly newspaper, The Ace. During his childhood, Roddenberry was interested in reading, especially pulp magazines, and was a fan of stories such as John Carter of Mars, Tarzan, and the Skylark series by E. E. Smith.|$|E
500|$|In January 1967 Peng {{was taken}} to his first [...] "struggle session", {{in which he was}} paraded in chains before several {{thousand}} jeering Red Guards, wearing a large paper dunce cap and with a wooden board hung from his neck, on which his [...] "crimes" [...] were written. In the fall Peng was held at a PLA military prison outside of Beijing, and was allowed to receive extra clothing. In July Mao and Lin Biao, cooperating with Jiang Qing's faction, ordered the PLA to form an [...] "investigation group" [...] to determine Peng's [...] "crimes", so that Peng could be more thoroughly humiliated in future struggle sessions. Peng's jailers attempted to force Peng to confess that he was a [...] "great warlord", a [...] "great ambitionist", and a [...] "great conspirator" [...] who had [...] "crept into the Party and the Army". Peng refused to confess to these accusations or to [...] "surrender to the masses", so his jailers strapped Peng to the floor of an unlit cell, and did not allow him to stand or sit up, drink water, rise to go to the toilet, or move in his sleep for several days. After Peng still refused to [...] "confess", his jailers began routinely beating him, breaking several ribs, injuring his back, and damaging his internal organs, especially his lungs. Peng's violent [...] "interrogations" [...] lasted over ten hours a day, but his interrogators were replaced every two hours in order to keep them from developing any sympathy for Peng (a practice pioneered by Stalinist secret police in the 1930s). Peng was [...] "interrogated" [...] in this way over 130 times. During interrogations he shouted denials to the Red Guards who beat him, and it is reputed that <b>he</b> <b>pounded</b> the table so hard that the cell walls shook.|$|E
60|$|There was {{no answer}} to this summons, and <b>he</b> <b>pounded</b> again. But nobody appeared.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{replied the}} machine; [...] "he is on-ly made to pound the road, {{and has no}} think-ing or speak-ing at-tach-ment. But <b>he</b> <b>pounds</b> ve-ry well, I think." ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{surprised}} about something, Pooch {{would say}} [...] "Heh!" [...] in a squeaky fashion. And when his girlfriend is in trouble, <b>he</b> <b>pounds</b> {{his chest and}} makes a Tarzan-esque shout before moving.|$|R
5000|$|He was 5'11" [...] and <b>he</b> weighed 180 <b>pounds.</b> <b>He</b> {{was drafted}} in the 11th round of the 1972 draft by the Denver Broncos.|$|R
60|$|Sam {{was gone}} {{less than two}} minutes when they heard a cry, and then <b>he</b> <b>pounded</b> on the door they had so {{carefully}} guarded.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll o-pen the door," [...] {{asserted}} Tik-Tok, {{and going}} to the King's big gong <b>he</b> <b>pounded</b> upon it until the noise was almost deafening.|$|E
60|$|He {{stumbled}} {{through the}} snow and over the ice and rocks {{until he reached the}} door of the cabin. <b>He</b> <b>pounded</b> loudly on the portal.|$|E
50|$|Born in Scranton, Pennsylvania, Williams was {{exceptionally}} big {{and strong}} from the start. When he was 12 years old weighing 200 <b>pounds,</b> <b>he</b> excelled in football and track and field. He reached the state finals in the shot put four times, winning once - and when <b>he</b> weighed 340 <b>pounds</b> <b>he</b> could dunk a basketball.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then I have {{pleasant}} news to give you," [...] {{the lawyer}} said. [...] "Mr. Goodenough died possessed of about sixty thousand <b>pounds.</b> <b>He</b> left fifteen thousand each to his only surviving nephew and niece. Fifteen thousand <b>pounds</b> <b>he</b> has divided among several charitable and scientific institutions. Fifteen thousand <b>pounds</b> <b>he</b> has left to you." ...|$|R
5000|$|... 5. The Coyote then {{attempts}} to load a cannon, but as <b>he</b> <b>pounds</b> in the cannonball with a stick, the cannon fires the two items out of it, with the Coyote still {{hanging on to}} the stick. Gravity results, and Wile E. and the stick land into the ground, to be pounded down by the cannonball.|$|R
60|$|It {{was four}} {{o'clock in the}} morning when Billy {{dismounted}} in front of Jose's hut. <b>He</b> <b>pounded</b> on the door until the man came and opened it.|$|E
60|$|For {{the rest}} of the time the Kittiwake lay in Apia Aloysius Pankburn pounded chain rust. Ten hours a day <b>he</b> <b>pounded.</b> And on the long stretch across to the Gilberts he still pounded.|$|E
6000|$|... "Think o' {{the money}} you'd make {{in a side}} show," [...] said Cap'n Joe with his funny chuckling laugh. Then <b>he</b> <b>pounded</b> his wooden leg against the hard floor and managed to hobble from the room without more accidents.|$|E
5000|$|... "After the {{candidates}} are balloted for and elected, the Grand Conductor {{goes out to the}} anteroom and escorts {{the candidates}} to the inside entrance door, where <b>he</b> <b>pounds</b> on the door with the hilt of his sword three times; the inside sentinel raises a little slide in the door-peeps out; and the chief officer from the inside asks in a loud voice: ...|$|R
50|$|Wilson {{was ranked}} as a two star by Scout.com and was {{measured}} at six foot four inches and <b>he</b> weighed 218 <b>pounds.</b> <b>He</b> received only one scholarship offer from East Carolina University.|$|R
5000|$|Then he {{goes around}} the room, {{greeting}} the patrons. But his good-natured ribbing of [...] "Smogzilla" [...] doesn't go over well with the giant lizard ("Say, Smog baby, leveled any major cities lately?", [...] "You know, Smogzilla's just like any unemployed actor, except when <b>he</b> <b>pounds</b> the pavement, it registers a ten on the Richter scale!", [...] "Oh, what's the matter? The public not buying those cheap special effects anymore?") who then eats Daffy.|$|R
60|$|Blanco Jose, {{like the}} other white horses, was big of frame and heavy, and thunder rolled from under his great hoofs. Nell pulled him up, and as <b>he</b> <b>pounded</b> and slid {{to a halt in}} a cloud of dust she swung lightly down.|$|E
60|$|How Dicky won {{through the}} next four months, and what hope he kept alight to force him into his work, no one dare say. <b>He</b> <b>pounded</b> on, the seven-hundred- rupee passage {{as far away as}} ever, and his style of living unchanged, except when he {{launched}} into a new filter.|$|E
60|$|He pictured Jeff Saxton leering at the door, {{and while}} <b>he</b> <b>pounded</b> Bill's shoulder, {{and called him}} the name which, west of Chicago, is the token of hatred and of extreme gladness at meeting, he {{discovered}} that some one had stolen his stomach and left a piece of ice in its place.|$|E
5000|$|Adolfo Rivera (born May 22, 1982) is a {{baseball}} player who is most notable for being on Panama's roster for the 2006 World Baseball Classic. He is 6'4" [...] tall and <b>he</b> weighs 215 <b>pounds.</b> <b>He</b> is right-handed.|$|R
60|$|And {{with his}} {{powerful}} fists <b>he</b> began <b>pounding</b> against the panels {{of the door}} which swung loosely under the heavy blows.|$|R
50|$|Salido, 33, of Mexico, {{failed to}} make weight and was {{stripped}} of his belt at the weigh-in. <b>He</b> was 128¼ <b>pounds,</b> well over the 126-pound limit. And <b>he</b> weighed 11 <b>pounds</b> more than Lomachenko {{at the start of}} the contest.|$|R
6000|$|... "Finally, Cap Floyd got {{promoted}} to be a major-general, or a knight {{commander of the}} main herd, or something like that. <b>He</b> <b>pounded</b> around on a white horse, all desecrated up with gold-leaf and hen-feathers and a Good Templar's hat, and wasn't allowed by the regulations to speak to us. And Willie Robbins was made captain of our company.|$|E
60|$|He {{kept his}} eyes about him, and {{presently}} saw the plant which he knew Robah had used in preparing the dye for him. Pulling all the leaves off, <b>he</b> <b>pounded</b> them with the stock of his rifle, and rubbed his face with juice from the leaves. There was sufficient to stain both his face and hands.|$|E
60|$|Some {{minutes later}} he lifted Millicent from the saddle, and she leaned against him almost {{powerless}} as <b>he</b> <b>pounded</b> on the door. The loud knocking was answered by voices within, the door swung open, and Millicent reeled into a long hall. Two women rose from beside the stove, and, for it was broad daylight now, stared in bewilderment at the strangers.|$|E
5000|$|At his pro day workout at Temple University, Burton {{measured}} 6-1¾ and 308 <b>pounds.</b> <b>He</b> ran a 5.39 forty-yard dash and did 31 reps of 225 <b>pounds.</b> <b>He</b> {{also had}} a 31½" [...] vertical leap and a broad jump of 9'5" ...|$|R
50|$|Cottam {{was born}} to Protestant parents, Laurence Cottam of Dilworth and Anne Brewer, but was {{converted}} as an adult to Catholicism by Thomas <b>Pound.</b> <b>He</b> studied at Brasenose College, Oxford, and received his M.A. on 14 July 1572, before leaving for London, where he became master of a grammar school. It was there that <b>he</b> met <b>Pound</b> and decided to head to Douai to become a priest.|$|R
50|$|Krazy {{wants to}} take a shower. However, he is being {{disturbed}} by a pesky rat. When Krazy chases the rat {{to the outside of}} the house, the rodent manages to tie a string around his tail. The rat hangs Krazy on a tree branch by his tail. After Krazy cries so much, the rat shows mock sympathy by cutting the string, causing the cat to drop. Krazy retaliates as <b>he</b> <b>pounds</b> and throws the rat onto a wall. The rat speaks and vows retribution.|$|R
60|$|He enthusiastically {{forced the}} plan on Mr. Wrenn. <b>He</b> <b>pounded</b> down-stairs {{and brought up}} Mrs. Arty. He dashed about the room, {{shouting}} directions. He dragged out his bureau for the railroad-president's desk, and a table for the secretary, and, after some consideration and much rubbing of his chin, with two slams and a bang he converted his hard green Morris-chair into an office safe.|$|E
60|$|When {{he came to}} a {{straight}} piece of trail, where the sled could get along for a moment without guidance, he let go the gee-pole and batted his right hand sharply upon the hard wood. He found it difficult to keep up the circulation in that hand. But while <b>he</b> <b>pounded</b> the one hand, he never ceased from rubbing his nose and cheeks with the other.|$|E
60|$|Master Hardy, with no very {{well-defined}} {{ideas of}} {{what he was going to}} do if he caught her, started in pursuit. His scalp was still smarting and his eyes watering with the pain as <b>he</b> <b>pounded</b> behind her. Panting wildly she heard him coming closer and closer, and she was just about to give up when, to her joy, she saw her father coming towards them.|$|E
6000|$|... "The old man {{pulls out}} a {{memorandum}} book and hunts in it. 'The 25th of April, Deering,' says he. 'I know it,' says Sir Percival. 'And ten minutes to twelve o'clock,' says the old man. 'By Jupiter! you haven't won yet.' And <b>he</b> <b>pounds</b> the table with his fist and yells to me: 'Waiter, call the manager at once--tell him to hurry here {{as fast as he}} can.' I go after the boss, and old Brockmann hikes up to the slosh on the jump.|$|R
40|$|It {{has come}} to my {{attention}} through the wisdom of Guru Jaua Opi that directly behind my navel exists a terrifying labyrinth of decaying gas pipes, {{one of which is}} leaking a weak blue flame. The Guru says, This is your life force. Or I think he said that. His accent is very heavy and the screeching war planes overhead mute all sound for a minute and a half, but he keeps talking. It holds the fire, I think <b>he</b> says. <b>He</b> <b>pounds</b> his own navel. What does your flame look like?[URL]...|$|R
5000|$|Before {{reaching}} the underground spot where Gunn and Fred are held, Groo has Angel keep the potion safe and then rushes into battle, despite Angel's suggestions. The tree quickly sticks {{one of its}} fleshy roots deep into Groo's chest. The tree gets stronger as it feeds on Groo, so Angel questions the tree as <b>he</b> <b>pounds</b> Groo into unconsciousness. The tree impales Angel instead, and suddenly the tree begins to die as it feeds off of Angel's dead heart. The others break free, and Gunn finishes the tree demon off.|$|R
