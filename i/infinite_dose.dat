In practice, dermal exposure mostly occurs under finite dose conditions. Therefore, a simple model to predict finite dose {{dermal absorption}} from <b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> data (K p and lag time) and the stratum corneum/water partition coefficient (K SC,W) was developed. To test the model, {{a series of}} in vitro dermal absorption experiments was performed under both infinite and finite dose conditions using acetic acid, benzoic acid, bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, butoxyethanol, cortisone, decanol, diazinone, 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, ethacrynic acid, linolenic acid, octylparaben, oleic acid, propylparaben, salicylic acid and testosterone. For six substances, the predicted relative dermal absorption was not statistically different from the measured value. For all other substances, measured absorption was overpredicted by the model, {{but most of the}} overpredictions were still below the European default absorption value.

The nanoemulsions significantly enhanced the skin penetration of caffeine and naproxen, compared to aqueous control solutions. Caffeine maximum flux enhancement was associated with a synergistic increase in both caffeine SC solubility and skin diffusivity, whereas a formulation-increased solubility in the SC was the dominant determinant for increased naproxen fluxes. Enhancements in SC solubility were related to the uptake of the formulation excipients containing the active compounds into the SC.

40|$|The recent {{development}} of rapid single sand-sized grain analyses in luminescence dating has necessitated the accurate interpretation of D-e distributions to recover a representative D-e acquired {{since the last}} bleaching event. Beta heterogeneity may adversely affect the variance and symmetry of D-e distributions {{and it is important}} to characterise this effect, both to ensure that dose distributions are not misinterpreted, and that an accurate beta dose rate is employed in dating calculations. In this study, we make a first attempt providing a description of potential problems in heterogeneous environments and identify the likely size of these effects on D-e distributions. The study employs the MCNP 4 C Monte Carlo electron/photon transport model, supported by an experimental validation of the code in several case studies. We find good agreement between the experimental measurements and the Monte Carlo simulations. It is concluded that the effect of beta, heterogeneity in complex environments for luminescence dating is two fold: (i) the <b>infinite</b> matrix <b>dose</b> rate is not universally applicable; its accuracy depends on the scale of the heterogeneity, and (ii) the interpretation of D-e distributions is complex and techniques which reject part of the D-e distribution may lead to inaccurate dates in some circumstances.

Short chapters describe the anatomy of the skin, the skin as a diffusion barrier, Fick’s law of diffusion, factors affecting dermal penetration and methods to assess dermal penetration. The major part of the report is devoted to compilation of data assessment of dermal penetration (fluxes and permeability coefficients) for 165 substances corresponding to 150 entries listed in the Swedish ordinance (AFS 2005) on Occupational Expsoure Limits (OELs). The compilation covers all 117 substances marked with an “H” in the ordinance and, in addition, 50 substances that have not been given a skin notation. The compiled data can be used in future revision of skin notations. An analysis of the data shows that quantitative information on dermal penetration is lacking for 53 or about one third of the 165 substances. For those who have quantitative data, a variety of species and experimental techniques have been used. There is a trillion-fold (1012) span in permeability coefficients between the substances. Moreover, for many chemicals with several experimental data sets on permeability, there is a huge intra-chemical span, sometimes several orders of magnitude. In these cases, a preferred study was selected, mainly based on the following criteria: human skin, in vivo studies, neat liquid, water as vehicle and <b>infinite</b> or large <b>dose</b> were preferred over animal skin, in vitro studies, vapor or diluted liquid, other vehicles and low dose, respectively.

It was subsequently deduced, using infrared spectroscopy, that the rapid percutaneous diffusion of propylene glycol, relative to ibuprofen, resulted in the transient maintenance of a saturated drug concentration at the SC surface even after removal of the original formulation.

The aim of this work was to optimize DECT acquisition protocols from simulations of X-ray images for the treatment planning of proton therapy using a projection-based dual-energy decomposition algorithm. MethodsWe have investigated the effect of various voltages and tin filtration combinations on the SPR map accuracy and precision, and the influence of the dose allocation between the low energy (LE) and the high energy (HE) acquisitions. For all spectra combinations, virtual CT projections of the Gammex phantom were simulated with a realistic energy-integrating detector response model. Two situations were simulated: an ideal case without noise (<b>infinite</b> <b>dose)</b> and a realistic situation with Poisson noise corresponding to a 20 mGy total central dose. To determine the optimal dose balance, the proportion of LE-dose with respect to the total dose was varied from 10 % to 90 % while keeping the central dose constant, for four dual-energy spectra. SPR images were derived using a two-step projection-based decomposition approach. The ranges of 70 MeV, 90 MeV and 100 MeV proton beams onto the adult female (AF) reference computational phantom of the ICRP were analytically determined from the reconstructed SPR maps. ResultsThe energy separation between the incident spectra had a strong impact on the SPR precision. Maximizing the incident energy gap reduced image noise. However, the energy gap was not a good metric to evaluate the accuracy of the SPR. In terms of SPR accuracy, a large variability of the optimal spectra was observed when studying each phantom material separately. The SPR accuracy was almost flat in the 30 - 70 % LE-dose range, while the precision showed a minimum slightly shifted in favor of lower LE-dose. Photon noise in the SPR images (20 mGy dose) had lower impact on the proton range accuracy since comparable results were obtained for the noiseless situation (<b>infinite</b> <b>dose).</b> Root-mean-square range errors averaged over all irradiation angles associated to dual-energy imaging were comprised between 0. 50 mm and 0. 72 mm for the noiseless situation and between 0. 51 mm and 0. 77 mm for the realistic scenario. ConclusionsThe impact of the dual-energy spectra and the dose allocation between energy levels on the SPR accuracy and precision determined through a projection-based dual-energy algorithm were evaluated to guide the choice of spectra for dual-energy CT for protontherapy. The dose balance between energy levels was not found to be sensitive for the SPR estimation.

40|$|Thesis (PhD (Pharmaceutics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2012. Transdermal drug {{delivery}} {{has the advantage}} over other routes of administration of avoiding the hepatic, first–pass metabolism {{that would result in}} better therapeutic efficacy, better patient medication compliance and reduced systemic side–effects (Kydoneieus & Berner, 1987 : 69). One disadvantage of this mode of {{drug delivery}} is the generally poor delivery of drugs through the skin. The intercellular lipid structure of the stratum corneum causes this membrane to be an excellent penetration barrier, which must be breached to enhance drug penetration through the skin. Factors influencing the drug–skin distribution include the physicochemical properties of the drug, the choice of the delivery vehicle and the drug application mode (finite and <b>infinite</b> <b>dose)</b> being used (Chen et al., 2011 : 224). The permeability of the skin is thus influenced by the physicochemical properties of both the permeant and the penetration enhancer (Dias et al., 2007 : 65). One way of overcoming this barrier function of the skin is to include penetration enhancer chemicals in the topical application. Such penetration enhancers partition into the stratum corneum and interact with the intercellular lipids, causing a temporary and reversible decrease in this barrier function. With the skin barrier function being reduced, drug transport through the skin increases (Magnusson et al., 2001 : 206). When a drug or the penetration enhancer vehicle does not have the ideal physicochemical properties, penetration through the skin is difficult and manipulation of the drug or the vehicle is necessary. By manipulating their physicochemical properties, or by making use of penetration enhancers, the transdermal absorption through the skin can be increased (Park et al., 2000 : 109). Chemical penetration enhancers use different mechanisms of action to increase permeation across the skin (Moser et al., 2001 : 110). When chemical enhancers are used in combination, a synergistic action between these enhancers offers a method of overcoming limitations being experienced when single chemical enhancers are used in improving transdermal drug delivery (Williams & Barry, 2004 : 604). As mentioned, both the choice of vehicle and the physicochemical properties of the permeant and vehicle should be considered during drug skin distribution studies, as well as the mode of application (finite or <b>infinite</b> <b>dose).</b> When consumers use commercial formulations to treat topical skin conditions, the vehicles applied are in varying doses lower than 30 mg/cm 2, depending on the application. In clinical situations, the formulation being applied depends on the body surface area being treated, i. e. the larger the surface area, the lower the amount of vehicle applied. When a cold sore is treated, for example, an average amount of 20 mg/cm 2 of the vehicle is applied to the infected area, with the treated surface area generally being very small (Trottet et al., 2004 : 214). When sunscreens are applied to the skin, a very large surface area is treated and an average amount of only 0. 5 mg/cm 2 is applied (Azurdia et al., 1999 : 255; Bech & Wulf, 1992 : 242). It is thus clear that the transdermal absorption of an active compound depends on the concentration being applied and the surface area treated. Considering the above parameters is thus of high significance when in vitro transdermal diffusion tests are performed. Risk assessment studies comprise another important area in which clinical relevant dose plays a significant role when data on transdermal absorption of a substance is produced. During in vitro diffusion studies to determine the permeability profile of an active compound, an “infinite dose(s) ” (> 150 ul) of the vehicle is applied to the membrane. One shortcoming of the <b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> application is that in some instances it may fail to imitate the levels of active compound being applied to the skin when commercial formulations are applied. It may also fail to imitate exposure levels to toxic chemicals. Results from in vitro studies would differ from those obtained during in vivo studies, if the clinically applied concentrations are not taken into account. The aims of this study were to determine the penetration enhancement effects of different penetration enhancer vehicles on the permeation of lipophilic ibuprofen through synthetic Carbosil® membrane, when used individually and in multi–component solvent mixtures, as well as {{to determine the effects of}} finite ( 2) to partition into the hydrated membrane (Zhang et al., 2010 : 895). Ibuprofen is a strongly lipophilic drug (log P = 3. 6) (Beetge et al., 2000 : 164), hence the lower permeation results for <b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> applications. Except for mineral oil that showed higher permeation levels with larger volumes, as a result of the lipophilic nature of both mineral oil and ibuprofen, the permeability of the lipophilic active increased as the membrane became more hydrated with the lipophilic solvent when larger volumes were applied. From the findings in this study it has become evident that: * The lipophilic/hydrophilic nature of the solvent and the permeant play a significant role in the absorption of a permeant through the membrane. This is an important factor in risk assessment studies, especially; * If the membrane is hydrated with a lipophilic delivery vehicle while carrying a lipophilic toxic permeant, the effect may be more harmful at lower levels of exposure; Lipophilic ibuprofen showed higher permeation levels with small application volumes of Miglyol® and of lipophilic mineral oil/Miglyol® combination delivery vehicles. * When a lipophilic toxic permeant comes in contact with a hydrophilic delivery vehicle, like propylene glycol and water, the effect may not be as significant even with high levels of exposure; and * The nature of the delivery vehicle and the permeant, as well as the level of exposure or application, play enormous roles in the prediction of permeant absorption through Carbosil® membrane or the skin.

40|$|The {{effect of}} donor volume on {{percutaneous}} absorption {{has been studied}} by computer simulation. When relatively large volumes are applied to the skin surface (<b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> conditions), the amount of permeant that leaves the donor is {{a small fraction of}} the original amount present and donor concentration does not change appreciably. Stratum corneum concentration rises gradually, as does the penetration rate, until a steady state is reached. With very small donor volumes, depletion of permeant leads to a decrease in donor concentration over time. As a result, stratum corneum concentrations and the rate of penetration rise to a peak and then fall, attaining much lower maximum values than with infinite dosing. The stratum corneum concentration gradient patterns are also influenced by depletion. If the transfer coefficient (K) is varied, donor concentration drops most rapidly and penetration rate is highest for the system with the largest value of K. However, the percentage r duction in penetration rate due to depletion is essentially independent of K. If the membrane/vehicle partition coefficient is varied, depletion affects the system with the highest partition coefficient to the greatest extent. With a donor volume of 0. 0032 ml and K equal to 0. 6 hr- 2, an increase in partition coefficient of eight times resulted in only a doubling of penetration rate...|$|E

The presence of caffeine in the skin membrane was not altered by skin thickness. Maximum flux and cumulative dose absorbed of testosterone and butoxyethanol (in both finite and infinite doses) were markedly reduced with full thickness (about 1 mm thick) skin compared with split thickness skin (about 0. 5 mm). Maximum flux of propoxur (dissolved in 60 % ethanol) was clearly higher through skin of 0. 71 mm than through skin of 1. 36 mm, but no difference was found between 0. 56 and 0. 71 mm. The proportion of propoxur present in the membrane after 24 h increased significantly over the complete range of thicknesses tested (0. 56 - 1. 36 mm). Conclusions: A complex relationship exists between skin thickness, lipophilicity and percutaneous penetration and distribution. This has implications for risk assessment studies and for the validation of models with data from different sources. © Springer-Verlag 2006...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to measure the {{absorption}} and intra-epidermal fate of S- 35 -radiolabelled sulphur mustard ((SM) -S- 35) in human breast skin in vitro. Skin (full-thickness or heat-separated epidermis) was placed into static diffusion cells and was exposed to droplets of liquid (SM) -S- 35 or saturated (SM) -S- 35 vapour. Amounts of (SM) -S- 35 penetrating the skin were measured from which skin absorption rates were calculated. Unbound radiolabel was washed from the surface, extracted from the skin and analysed to determine the identity of the radiolabelled species in order to measure the extent of hydrolysis of sulphur mustard. Penetration rates of liquid (SM) -S- 35 measured in vitro (71 - 294 mug cm(- 2) h(- 1)) were in agreement with those measured previously in vivo using human volunteers (60 - 240 mug cm(- 2) h(- 1)), Rates of liquid (SM) -S- 35 Skin absorption under occluded, <b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> conditions were highest through heat-separated epidermal membranes (294 +/- 58 mug cm(- 2) h(- 1)) and lowest through full-thickness skin (71 +/- 14 mug cm(- 2) h(- 1)). Fluxes of saturated (SM) -S- 35 vapour (110 +/- 75 mug cm(- 2) h(- 1)) through heat-separated membranes were similar to those previously measured through human forearm skin in vivo (162 mug cm(- 2) h(- 1)), Although hydrolysis of 35 SM did occur, both on the surface and within the skin, it accounted for only a small percentage of the total applied dose (< 2. 7 +/- 1. 2 %). The difference in total amount of liquid 35 SM penetrated between occluded and unoccluded conditions in. vitro (79 +/- 14 %) was similar to that lost as vapour from unoccluded skin in vivo (80 %), A substantial reservoir of (SM) -S- 35 (14 - 36 % of the applied dose) was measured within heat-separated epidermal membranes for up to 24 h which may have significant implications for the management of personnel exposed to sulphur mustard.

40|$|Dermal {{absorption}} is {{an important}} factor in regulatory science regarding the registration of chemicals, agrochemicals and cosmetics. The issue has gained importance since it has been discovered that the skin is not completely impenetrable for chemical substances. [1] Different ways to assess dermal absorption range from QSAR models to complex in vivo studies including a complete toxicokinetic examination. The choice of method depends on the question that has to be answered as different systems give different results: absorption as % of applied dose in in vivo studies or permeability coefficient and lag time in <b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> in vitro studies [1]. Since the OECD has adopted a guideline for assessing dermal penetration in vitro in 2004 the number of in vitro studies is rising continuously. Depending on the chosen method results may vary in reliability and in acceptance by regulatory authorities. Based on data shown by Scholz et al. in 2014 [2] about 4200 data sets from the eChemPortal [3] extended with data from the EDETOX database [4] has been analyzed in depth. In a first approach the references have been reviewed for scientific reliability and categorized in one out of four reliability categories ranging from A as the highest to C as the lowest reliability score. The fourth category D is used for special studies that cannot be compared directly. These are for example repeated dose studies including data on absorption. The data can be used for multiple scenarios: i. e. data for a certain substance or substance class could support read across for registration purposes but also statistic evaluations concerning species or methods used are possible. The first results taken from the data will be presented showing that up to now 62 % of the references are in vitro studies and the number of QSAR studies is rising during the past ten years. Nearly one third of all references are studies using rat skin (30 %); about 35 % used human skin. Regarding the reliability criteria about one third are marked with the highest category A while only 4 % were categorized C for unreliable. In summary a large dataset with consistent and reliable data from various exposure scenarios can help to provide a reasonable prediction of dermal absorption which can be achieved by our database.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to determine the in vitro dermal absorption of ethylene glycol (EG) through dermatomed human abdominal skin (containing epidermis and dermis), obtained from cadavers within 24 hours of death and kept frozen until processed. Three formulations of EG (neat, 50 %, and 10 % aqueous solutions) were applied in triplicate to skin samples from 6 donors, and placed in Teflon Bronaugh flow-through diffusion cells. Barrier integrity of each sample was evaluated with 3 H-H 2 O prior to applying EG and only data from samples passing the test were used. A physiological receptor fluid was pumped beneath the skin samples and collected in a fraction collector at predetermined time points through 24 hours. Possible volatilized EG was trapped in a charcoal basket located above each skin sample. Each skin sample was treated with an <b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> of 500 mL of EG formulation/cm 2. At the end of 24 hours, volatilized EG trapped in the headspace was collected, the unabsorbed dose was removed from the skin and the skin was rinsed, tape stripped, and solubilized along with a rinse of the flow-through cells, and total radioactivity was determined. Only a small fraction (1 %) of the applied EG was absorbed in 24 hours, of which < 0. 7 % penetrated through the skin and* 0. 4 % remained in the skin. Recovery (mass balance) of the applied EG was between 93 % and 99 %, which further validated the observed low dermal penetration of EG. The net penetration of the applied EG over 24 hours was concentration proportional, comprising 2. 97 + 0. 78, 1. 75 + 0. 62, and 0. 23 + 0. 12 mg/cm 2 of the neat, 50 %, and 10 % formula-tions, respectively. The steady-state flux of EG was established between 16 and 24 hours. The mean steady-state flux of EG through dermatomed skin was 217, 129, and 15 mg/cm 2 h for the neat, 50 %, and 10 % aqueous formulations, respectively, con-sistent with concentration-proportional penetration of EG. The steady-state permeation coefficient (Kp) for EG was low, between 1. 5 104 and 2. 6 104 cm/h. These findings demonstrate that EG dermal penetration is expected to be very low and to be slow, indicating very limited systemic or internal dose of EG due to dermal exposure...|$|E
40|$|New drug {{entities}} (NDE) {{are constantly}} being developed with most of them intended for oral administration. For this reason, {{there is a need}} to estimate their absorption in order to save time and money that would be lost if the drug enters the clinical stage and is then found to exhibit poor absorption. For many years, the use of animals was the most abundant method for studying pharmacokinetics to predict parameters such as intestinal absorption. However, these methods are time consuming, and expensive as well as being ethically unfavourable. As a result, developing other methods to evaluate a drug’s pharmacokinetics is crucial. The aim of this work was to develop in vitro methods for estimation of human intestinal absorption (%HIA) to replace the use of the aforementioned, less favourable methods involving the use of animals. Among the developed methods in this thesis is a unique type of chromatography known as micellar liquid chromatography (MLC) using biosurfactants such as bile salts as a mobile phase. Furthermore, studies investigated the effect of a change in the stationary phase in addition to investigating the effect of the change in temperature on the elution of the analysed compounds. It was found that R 2 PRED for the developed MLC methods was in the range of 43. 3 % - 91. 12 %. Another developed method was a spectrophotometric method based on the use of the solubilising effects of bile salts, as well as their binding to compounds. Therefore, two spectrophotometric methods were developed, a solubilisation method and a double reciprocal method, and used in the prediction of %HIA. It was found that the solubilisation method had a better predictability for %HIA than that of the double reciprocal method where R 2 PRED was found to be 82. 32 % and 61. 90 % respectively. Finally, a permeation method was developed using the ability of NaDC to form a hydrogel under specific conditions and applying the investigated drugs in an <b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> to the prepared hydrogels. This facilitated the determination of permeability coefficients (Kp) that were then used in the prediction of %HIA using the obtained model. The two developed permeation methods were found to have close values of R 2 PRED for % HIA where R 2 PRED of the permeation method using flow through cells was found to be 79. 8 % while that of the permeation method using Franz cells was found to be 79. 67 %. In summary, this work reports several unique models for the in vitro prediction of human intestinal absorption, potentially removing the need for animal testing to predict %HIA...|$|E
40|$|Absorption {{of toxic}} {{substances}} via the skin is an important phenomenon {{in the assessment of}} the risk of exposure to these substances. People are exposed to a variety of substances and products via the skin, either directly or indirectly, while at work, at home or in public space. Pesticides, organic solvents and metalworking fluids are seen to be important contributors to adverse health effects due to occupational exposure via the skin. In daily life, cosmetics, clothing and household products are the most relevant commodities with respect to exposure via the skin. Given the importance of skin exposure in the assessment of the risk {{of toxic substances}},  the objective of this thesis was to further develop, evaluate and improve methods for including skin absorption data this assessment. In this thesis, four factors influencing dermal absorption, namely dermal loading (chapters 3 and 6), irritative/corrosive potential (chapters 3 and 4), frequency of exposure (chapters 3, 4 and 5) and the vehicle used (chapter 5), were investigated in more detail. Furthermore, a model to extrapolate <b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> absorption data to finite dose conditions, baptized Dermal Absorption Model for Extrapolation (DAME), was developed and tested. I   n chapter 2 of this thesis, the relationship between relative dermal absorption and dermal loading was investigated. Hundred-and-thirty-eight dermal publicly available absorption experiments with 98 substances were evaluated. The results obtained revealed that dermal loading ranged mostly between 0. 001 and 10 mg/cm 2. In 87 experiments (63 %), an inverse relationship was observed between relative dermal absorption and dermal loading. On average, relative absorption at high dermal loading was 33 times lower than at low dermal loading. Known skin irritating and volatile substances less frequently showed an inverse relationship between dermal loading and relative absorption. It was concluded that when using relative dermal absorption in regulatory risk assessment, its value should be determined at or extrapolated to dermal loadings relevant for the exposure conditions being evaluated. I   n chapter 3 of this thesis, a literature search was presented with the aim to investigate whether neglecting the effects of repeated exposure may lead to an incorrect estimate of dermal absorption. The results demonstrated that the effect of repeated versus single exposure does not demonstrate a unique trend. Nevertheless, an increase in daily absorption was frequently observed upon repeated daily exposure. The little information available mostly concerned pharmaceuticals. However, consumers and workers may be repeatedly exposed to other types of chemicals, like disinfectants and cleaning products, which often contain biocidal active substances that may decrease the barrier function of the skin, especially after repeated exposure. These biocidal products, therefore, may present a safety risk that is not covered by the current risk assessment practice since absorption data are usually obtained by single exposure experiments. Consequently, it was decided to investigate the importance of this issue for biocide safety evaluation. As the literature search revealed that hardly any data on absorption upon repeated dermal exposure to biocides are available, it was concluded that data need to be generated by testing. To cover the entire range of biocidal products in such testing, a representative series of biocidal substances should be tested, making in vitro testing of dermal absorption the preferred choice over in vivo testing. Based on an inventory made, it appeared that the 16 product types represented among the biocidal products authorised in the Netherlands could be clustered into 6 more or less homogeneous categories based on similarity in active substances. This result could facilitate experimental testing by providing a basis for selection of a limited number of representative compounds to be evaluated. I   n chapter 4 of this thesis, the importance of the effect of repeated dermal exposure on skin permeability for biocide safety evaluation was investigated, using a selection of nine representative biocides from the inventory made in chapter 3. The in vitro dermal penetration of tritiated water and [14 C]propoxur was chosen as a measure of the permeability and integrity of human abdominal skin after single and repeated exposure. The results indicated that single and repeated exposure to specific biocidal products (e. g. the quaternary ammonium chlorides DDAC and ADBAC) may significantly increase skin permeability, especially when the compounds are applied at high concentrations, while a substance like formaldehyde may reduce skin permeability under specific conditions. I   n chapter 5 of this thesis, the in vitro dermal absorption kinetics of the quaternary ammonium compound didecyldimethylammonium chloride (DDAC) during single and repeated exposure was studied in more detail. In addition, the influence of biocidal formulations on the absorption of DDAC was investigated, because it was expected that formulation characteristics may be another factor influencing its dermal absorption. The analysis of biocidal products on the Dutch market, reported in chapter 3, indicated that DDAC is often used in combination with other active ingredients. DDAC was most frequently combined with formaldehyde, glutaraldehyde and/or alkyldimethylbenzyl­ammo­nium chloride (ADBAC). Consequently, commercial formulations containing {{one or more of these}} additional active ingredients were selected, in addition to one formulation containing only DDAC as an active ingredient. The selected commercial formulations tended to reduce skin penetration of DDAC. This was most pronounced with the formulation containing the highest concentration of formaldehyde (196 mg/mL) and glutaraldehyde (106  mg/mL), which reduced the flux of DDAC across the skin by 95 %. The reduction caused by the only tested formulation containing no other active ingredients than DDAC, and thus incorporating no aldehydes, was smallest, and did not reach statistical significance. I   n chapter 6 of this thesis, a simple in silico model to predict finite dose dermal absorption from <b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> data (kp and lag time) and the stratum corneum/water partition coefficient (KSC,W) was developed. This model was tentatively called D ermal Absorption Model for Extrapolation (DAME). As dermal exposure may occur under a large variety of conditions leading to quite different rates of absorption, such a predictive model using simple experimental or physicochemical inputs provides a cost-effective means to estimate dermal absorption under different conditions. To evaluate the DAME, a series of in vitro dermal absorption experiments was performed under both infinite and finite dose conditions using a variety of different substances. The kp’s and lag times determined in the <b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> experiments were entered into DAME to predict relative dermal absorption value under finite dose conditions. For six substances, the predicted relative dermal absorption under finite dose conditions was not statistically different from the measured value. For all other substances, measured absorption was overpredicted by DAME, but most of the overpredicted values were still lower than 100 %, the European default absorption value for the tested compounds. In conclusion, our finite dose prediction model (DAME) provides a useful and cost-effective estimate of in vitro dermal absorption, to be used in risk assessment for non-volatile substances dissolved in water at non-irritating concentrations. I   n chapter 7 of this thesis, the results of the research reported in chapters 2 to 6 were put into perspective, the pitfalls and promises emanating from them discussed and general conclusions drawn. The possible influence of vehicles on absorption and the possible impact of irritative or corrosive vehicles or chemicals on the skin barrier have been demonstrated in this thesis. An in silico predictive model tentatively called DAME was developed, which enables the user to evaluate a variety of dermal exposure scenarios with limited experimental data (kp and lag time) and easy to obtain physicochemical properties (MW and log KOW). The predictions of our experiments reported in chapter 6 were compared to those of the Finite Dose Skin Permeation (FDSP) model published on the internet by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). DAME outperformed FDSP (R 2 of the correlation predicted/measured potential absorption 0. 64 and 0. 12, respectively). At present, the applicability domain of DAME is limited to non-volatile substances dissolved in aqueous solvents. However, in future the model will be adapted to include volatile substances as well. Altogether, it is concluded that dermal exposure can be an important factor in risks posed by chemicals and should be taken into account in risk assessment. The methods to actually do this are still open for further improvement to better account for the various factors influencing skin penetration and to develop adequate combinations of in vitro and in silico models that can accurately predict human dermal absorption.  ...|$|E
40|$|Problem statement: The {{widespread}} use of organophosphorus pesticides (OPs) in agriculture and urban pest control has seen significant morbidity and mortality. They {{are the most important}} cause of severe toxicity and death from acute poisoning worldwide, with more than 200, 000 deaths each year in developing countries. OPs act to inhibit acetylcholinesterase in the nervous system, and may elicit acute and long term health effects. Some commercially available OPs are also classified as Chemicals of Security Concern by the Australian Government and are subject to special restrictions and surveillance. Occupational exposure may occur in manufacture, storage, transport, usage, disposal and in emergency situations. For example, ambulance workers may be exposed when attending accidental or intentional OP poisonings. The profiles may vary from short term high exposures for emergency personnel, to long term low exposures for farming communities. The World Health Organisation and a range of other agencies have determined that the continued use of these chemicals represents an important public and occupational health issue. A major route of exposure is skin absorption, and the use of protective chemical gloves is recommended, especially for the concentrated product. Safety data sheets (SDS) are meant to provide the user with information on appropriate glove protection. However, the concentrates are typically formulated products with solvents and additives that may influence the glove permeation behaviour of the active ingredient. Testing by glove manufacturers is rarely with the formulated product, and pertains to room temperature experiments with new gloves. Cheap or disposable gloves may not have been tested. In addition, the effects of elevated temperature, abrasion and ultraviolet (UV) exposure are poorly understood. Although these environmental factors are likely to be present in Australian workplaces, there is scant evidence of their practical significance to inform risk assessment and interventions, including glove selection and use. Apart from gloves, skin uptake may be influenced by high ambient temperatures. The limited dermal toxicological research literature suggests that skin penetration rates may be dramatically increased, with concomitant increases in health risk. Compounding the problem is the situation where chemical is occluded between glove and skin. Gap analysis: Based on a review of the occupational hygiene literature, knowledge gaps exist in three areas, relating to glove performance and skin penetration. Firstly, suppliers and formulators of agricultural OPs recommend the use of long length polyvinyl chloride (PVC) gloves. Indeed, distributors stock cheap versions of such gloves, but as they are not considered disposable, repeated use is the norm. Scientific uncertainty exists as to the protection afforded under real world conditions of solar radiation, elevated temperature and abrasion. Secondly, the chemical barrier performance of disposable gloves, as worn by ambulance workers in poisoning episodes, has not been investigated. Thirdly, it is known that skin absorption of chemicals depends on physicochemical properties such as molecular size and water solubility. However, there appear to be no skin penetration studies which have compared a range of OPs of different properties. Moreover, the studies that have been conducted have often used a finite dose model. An <b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> model is more applicable for worst case occupational risk assessment. Purpose statement: This research aims to provide a better understanding of dermal exposure to OPs (under simulated real world conditions) and to generate data useful for predictive dermal risk assessment models and optimising control measures. It is anticipated that the improved evidence base will assist in reducing morbidity and mortality from OPs. A case study approach will be used, addressing both routine users and those in an emergency setting. Broad Research Questions: The following questions were developed from a literature review and context scoping from fieldwork observations. 1. How do the recommended PVC gloves (unused, exposed to UV and abrasion) perform against OPs in various exposure conditions? 2. What are the effects of different variable conditions on the barrier performance of different types of disposable gloves worn by ambulance workers and is the current practice suitable? 3. How is skin penetration affected by physicochemical properties of OPs, concentration of Ops and elevated temperature? Methodology: Four OPs widely used in Australia (omethoate, mevinphos, dichlorvos and diazinon) with differing physicochemical properties (e. g. octanol-water partition coefficient) were investigated. Tests were conducted at the full strength formulation (relevant for transport and mixing activities) and application strength (relevant for spraying), and at two temperatures. In the glove permeation studies, American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) permeation cells were used at two temperatures (room temperature and 45 °C). Two case study scenarios were used, namely agricultural workers and ambulance workers. For Case Study 1 two brands of elbow length PVC gloves recommended for handling OPs were tested in new unused condition, and following UV exposure or abrasion. In Case Study 2 disposable nitrile and neoprene gloves used by South Australia Ambulance Service (SAAS) workers were tested individually and in combination (as per current practice). In the skin studies, human abdominal skin samples (heat separated epidermis) were exposed to the OPs (<b>infinite</b> <b>dose)</b> in static Franz cells according to OECD protocols for up to 8 hours, at room temperature and 37 °C. Analysis for the OPs in both glove and skin experiments was undertaken using HPLC and UV detection. Main Findings: Glove performance tests – Case Study 1 Differences were noted in breakthrough time and cumulative penetration {{at the end of the}} 8 -hour experiments for the two PVC glove brands. In general, PVC gloves performed well against the four tested OPs. Full strength formulations had shorter breakthrough times and greater cumulative permeations. Breakthrough of diazinon did not occur unless at full strength at 45 °C (120 – 180 mins). In contrast, breakthrough of dichlorvos was observed for all exposure conditions (between 60 to 240 mins) except for application strength at room temperature. Mevinphos, which was only tested at room temperature, demonstrated breakthrough only for one brand of gloves. In the case of omethoate, breakthrough was noted from 60 minutes onwards. Permeation was uniformly higher at 45 °C compared to room temperature. Gloves exposed to UV light (approximately equivalent to a week or more of extreme sunlight) or abrasion (5 % thickness reduction) exhibited a small reduction in performance. Glove performance tests – Case Study 2 In glove performance tests on gloves used by SAAS workers, disposable nitrile and neoprene gloves demonstrated good protection against the four tested OPs in 4 -hour experiments. In general, the thicker neoprene gloves demonstrated longer breakthrough times than nitrile gloves. At higher test concentration (full strength) of the four tested OPs, cumulative penetration at 8 hrs increased, and this was observed at both test temperatures. Elevated temperature to 45 °C shortened the breakthrough time (between 5 and 20 minutes) and resulted in greater cumulative penetration of the OPs. Combining the disposable gloves (nitrile on neoprene) as practised by SAAS workers demonstrated better protection with longer breakthrough times and lower cumulative penetration of the tested OPs, compared to individual gloves. In vitro skin studies Dichlorvos was found to rapidly penetrate the skin. Elevated temperature and higher OP concentration resulted in faster penetration rate and increased cumulative penetration of the tested OPs. Comparison of the skin penetration data with Acceptable Daily Intakes (ADIs) of the respective OPs showed that ADIs may be exceeded rapidly, with the order being dichlorvos, diazinon, omethoate and mevinphos. Novelty of the research: This research uses an experimental design based on real life scenarios. Unlike most glove permeation and skin penetration studies this research used formulated OP products that are commercially available in the market. All experiments were conducted using an <b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> model to simulate the worst exposure scenario (prolonged skin contamination from spills and splashes), and thus to establish the maximum penetration rates for risk assessment. Similarly, tests were conducted at elevated temperatures and with gloves exposed to ultraviolet (UV) and abrasion to mimic the common exposure conditions in real world scenarios. Implications: The research has highlighted the importance of elevated temperature, and the dermal risks associated with dichlorvos. The increased barrier protection afforded by double gloving (combining relatively polar and non-polar materials), for OPs of different physico-chemical properties, was shown. This is reassuring for ambulance workers who may encounter a range of OPs. Surprisingly, the influence of UV exposure and abrasion on the performance of the thick PVC gloves was found to be relatively minor, under the conditions examined. Data on the influence of physicochemical properties, concentration, and temperature are useful for refining dermal risk assessment models, and for worker education. On a broader public health level, the findings will allow a more rational use of gloves as chemical protective clothing to protect the population at risk from the danger of agricultural chemicals. Conclusions and Recommendations: The data indicate that the use of concentrated OPs in warmer conditions will greatly increase skin uptake. Dichlorvos demonstrated rapid and extensive skin penetration, but the data for all the tested OPs suggest that toxicologically important uptake can occur in relatively short time periods without skin protection. Glove permeation also increases with concentration, temperature, UV and abrasion. The practice of double gloving by ambulance workers is supported by the evidence. Following these exploratory studies, it is recommended that more glove permeation tests be conducted under realistic exposure scenarios. The findings should be compiled in a database for advisory purposes and made publicly accessible. Warnings for potential ADI exceedance should be included on labels or SDSs of the OP products to alert the users of the risks when handling OPs. Where changes may be made in the OP formulation by manufacturers, the suitability of glove recommendations should be reviewed. Thesis (Ph. D.)

40|$|Pain {{caused by}} severe skin wounds asks for the {{treatment}} with systemically applied opioids which is associated with severe and encumbering adverse effects like respiratory depression. Due {{to the presence of}} opioid receptors in the skin the topical treatment with morphine is possible. Thus, the additionally required systemic dose and first of all the adverse effects may be reduced. Besides, standardized wound management including regular changes of the wound dressing is really painful for the patient and bears the risk of destroying the newly generated epithelia. The main objective of this work was the development of a suitable carrier system for morphine which provides a long-lasting, sustained drug release. In addition, biotransformation of morphine and percutaneous absorption were also investigated. Initially an HPLC-method was developed further and optimized for the quantification of morphine and hydromorphone (internal standard) in different matrices based on a method previously developed within the work group. The lower limit of quantification could be decreased from 1 to 0. 1 µM using a fluorescence detector in combination with an UV-detector and the quantification of morphine in reconstructed human skin became possible. Linearity, resolution as well as intraday and interday variety show that the results obtained with this method are reproducible and valid. In order to investigate the biotransformation of morphine in the skin, gene-expression of UDP-glucuronosyltransferase 2 B 7 (UGT 2 B 7), the major metabolizing enzyme of morphine, was determined in normal human keratinocytes and fibroblasts as well as the keratinocyte cell line HaCaT. It was shown that UGT 2 B 7 is not or only expressed in traces in the different cell types. In order to confirm these findings a biotransformation experiment with human skin microsomes was performed. Two hours of microsomal incubation resulted in a negligible formation of metabolites. Thus a considerable biotransformation of morphine in the skin can be excluded. Solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) which can provide sustained release were initially considered as a possible carrier system for morphine. It could be shown that SLN are not appropriate as a carrier system for morphine due to the low entrapment efficiency and the fast morphine release from the SLN-dispersion. The embedding of the particles in hydroxyethylcellulose gel DAB did not improve release kinetics in an adequate way. In fact, the hydrogel itself showed an even slower morphine release compared to the SLN-loaded gel. Thus, in the next steps poloxamer gels were investigated as a carrier system for morphine. Since the Lutrol® F 127 25 % hydrogel showed the slowest morphine release it was further characterized. It could be shown that release rates decreased with increasing concentration of the gel forming agent due to decreasing diffusion pass ways within the gel. No significant difference in morphine release could be observed using gels with pH 7. 4 and 6. 0. Finally, morphine release from Lutrol® F 127 25 % hydrogel over a period of 48 hours was determined in comparison to hydroxyethylcellulose gel DAB. Release studies revealed that the Lutrol® F 127 25 % hydrogel is an appropriate carrier system for morphine: it provided a constant morphine release up to 24 hours, whereas 100 % of morphine were released after 12 hours from the reference gel. The sustained release behavior of the poloxamer gel resulted also in a slower percutaneous absorption. In comparison to the poloxamer gel a higher amount of morphine penetrated in epidermis and dermis (reconstructed human skin) from the reference gel over a period of 3 or 6 hours, respectively, both under finite and <b>infinite</b> <b>dose</b> conditions. Hydroxyethylcellulose gel DAB provided also a higher morphine permeation. Release behavior and percutaneous absorption of morphine from Lutrol® F 127 25 % hydrogel give reason to expect a successful treatment of severe skin wounds due to the long-lasting morphine release over 24 hours and the positive analgesic effect of IntraSite gel shown in clinical studies. Before the poloxamer gel can be used in clinical studies, percutaneous absorption of morphine in wounded skin and the influence of both gels on the wound healing process must be investigated...|$|E
