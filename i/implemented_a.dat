With the presented mechanism a transaction runs under several concurrency control mechanisms and the appropriate one is chosen based on the accessed data. For this purpose, the data is divided into four classes based on its access type and usage (semantics). Class O (the optimistic class) <b>implements</b> <b>a</b> first-committer-wins strategy, class R (the reconciliation class) <b>implements</b> <b>a</b> first-n-committers-win strategy, class P (the pessimistic class) <b>implements</b> <b>a</b> first reader-wins strategy, and class E (the escrow class) <b>implements</b> <b>a</b> firsnreaderswin strategy. Accordingly, the model is called OjRjPjE. Under this model the TPC-C benchmark outperforms other CC mechanisms like optimistic Snapshot Isolation...|$|R

5|$|At Los Alamos, Bradbury became head of E-5, the Implosion Experimentation Group, {{which put}} him {{in charge of the}} {{implosion}} field test program. In August, the laboratory's director, Robert Oppenheimer, <b>implemented</b> <b>a</b> sweeping reorganisation. E-5 became part of George Kistiakowsky's new Explosives Division (X Division), and was renumbered X-1. At this point, Bradbury was leading some of the most critical work at the laboratory, as it struggled with the jets that spoiled the perfect spherical shape desired for the implosion process. These were examined with a combination of magnetic, X-ray and RaLa techniques.|$|E

Every minor release should at least be supported for two years with security and bug fixes, followed by at least one year of only security fixes, for a total of a three-year release process for every minor release. No new features, unless small and self-contained, are to be introduced into a minor release during the three-year release process.|$|E
