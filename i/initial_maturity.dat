30|$|An {{operational}} definition of measure regards defining in details how a measure must be collected and analyzed {{according to its}} intended use. For instance, measures used at high maturity levels for analyzing process performance must apply statistical process control techniques.

This {{is not the case}} for measures used at <b>initial</b> <b>maturity</b> levels, where their intended use is to support traditional project monitoring and control.|$|E
30|$|It is {{worthwhile}} {{to notice that}} {{despite the fact that}} the strategy proposes a combined use of its components, they can also be used individually.

40|$|The {{assumption}} that developing follicles communicate through circulating hormones {{has been used}} to obtain a class of interaction laws that describe follicle growth. A specific member of this class has been shown to control ovulation number. Although all interacting follicles obey the same growth law and are given <b>initial</b> <b>maturities</b> that are chosen at random from a uniform distribution, ovulatory and atretic follicles emerge. Changing the parameters in the growth law can alter the most probable ovulation number values, anovulatory states are also admitted as possible solutions of the growth law. The behavior of the model is examined for interacting follicle populations of different size. Methods are suggested for identifying growth laws in particular mammals.

30|$|Although BRSM has {{recommendations}} {{that must be}} used aiming at SPC implementation, there are {{recommendations that}} deal with measurement at <b>initial</b> <b>maturity</b> levels. This occurs because, as said before and pointed out by {{results of the study}} based on systematic review (Sect.  3), most problems related to measurement at high maturity levels usually had an origin at initial levels. Frequently, these problems have less impact on measurement results at initial levels so, only when organizations start SPC practices, they realize these problems.|$|E
30|$|Software {{organizations}} that are interested in using SPC are generally {{in one of two}} scenarios.

40|$|Potted lychee trees (cv. Tai so) {{of varying}} {{vegetative}} flush maturity were grown under {{a range of}} temperature regimes and monitored for subsequent shoot structure and development. A combination of low temperature (15 / 17 or 18 / 13 degreesC day/night) and high vegetative flush maturity was necessary for floral initiation to occur, Exposure to high temperatures (28 / 23 degreesC) invariably resulted {{in the production of}} vegetative shoots, irrespective of flush maturity. Strong floral initiation was marked by the emergence of terminal particles and accompanying axillary particles. A decrea,;e in vegetative flush maturity or increase in temperature (e. g. 23 / 18 degreesC) resulted in a decrease in axillary shoot formation and the production of several intermediate shoot structures. These included leafy particles, stunted particles, partially emerged buds and non-emergent swollen buds, often produced on the same tree. At 23 / 18 degreesC, closer synchronisation of <b>initial</b> flush <b>maturity</b> was required for the production of a consistent shoot-type. Trees with synchronised mature flushes (I- 2) at 23 / 18 degreesC resulted in the production of swollen terminal buds. Healthy trees were maintained in this state for at least 11 months. These results indicate that both temperature and flush maturity can influence subsequent shoot structure of lychee. In the absence of either a strong floral temperature (18 / 13 degreesC) or strong vegetative temperature (28 / 23 degreesC), slight differences in <b>initial</b> flush <b>maturity</b> have gteater impact on the type of emerging shoot formed.

40|$|Firmness {{is one of}} {{the main}} quality {{attributes}} of sliced tomatoes. Here, a physiology-based mechanism is proposed that describes the development of firmness as measured by limited compression. The mechanism assumes that softening of slices is radically different from that of whole tomatoes and depends on the stage of ripening at slicing. During slicing the pericarp solubility will quickly increase because of exposure to, amongst others, vacuolar content with a low pH. This exposure will have a more serious effect on the firmness behaviour of ripe sliced tomatoes as in that case the pH will already be lower due to normal ripening. This mechanism has been translated into a kinetic model that describes the individual firmness behaviour over time and a batch model that describes the variation in firmness within batches of slices. Firmness data were recorded for different cultivars as a function of time at different temperatures, <b>initial</b> <b>maturity,</b> type of compression and treatment with ethylene and 1 -MCP just before slicing. Both models were well able to describe the trends present in the firmness data, with an average percentage variance accounted for of 89 %, despite the high variability in the raw data. The firmness decay due to the wounding was very fast, within 12 h. The effect of the <b>initial</b> <b>maturity</b> on the final firmness level was large. On the other hand, the effect of treating whole tomatoes with ethylene and 1 -MCP on the firmness development of slices was minimal. This indicates that for consumer acceptance of sliced tomatoes, tomato cultivars need to be selected with a sufficient final (structural) firmness combined with a thorough assessment of the maturity at slicin...|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{we focused}} on how the heating rate might affect the {{maturation}} of CM during earthquake slip, and demonstrated experimentally that a high heating rate can inhibit various organochemical reactions of CM.

Furthermore, mechanochemical effects during earthquake slip can also strongly affect the maturation of CM (Kaneki et al. 2018). Therefore, comprehensive consideration of the effects on CM maturation of both heating rate and mechanochemistry, {{as well as of the}} <b>initial</b> <b>maturity</b> of the starting CM, is needed to establish a more rigorous proxy of frictional heat recorded in fault rocks and to infer fault slip behaviors during earthquakes.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - This {{purpose of}} the paper is to present a {{maturity}} model developed to assess Knowledge Sharing (KS) for the Jordanian construction sector. Design/methodology/approach - The research was conducted in three stages. The first stage consisted of the review of literature and documenting variables from the literature that highlight influence on KS in organisations. The second stage was designed for maturity model development by identifying the cultural factors that affect KS in the Jordanian construction sector through questionnaires and interviews. Factor {{analysis was used to}} find possible relationships between the cultural variables followed by semi-structured interviews. In the third stage the <b>initial</b> <b>maturity</b> model was refined through another set of semi-structured interviews. Findings – The model presented in the paper includes three levels of maturity. The first level identifies whether the variable barely exists in company’s KS practices. The second level shows the occasional techniques which the company uses to increase KS activities. The final level demonstrates the importance of the variable in affecting KS as being fundamentally ingrained in the company’s vision, mission, strategy and operations.

Although the model has been applied to the construction industry, it can easily be modified to fit other sectors...|$|E
30|$|The ID/IG {{ratio of}} Raman spectra {{has long been}} {{believed}} to decrease with increasing CM maturity (e.g., Beyssac et al. 2002; Kuo et al. 2017), whereas we observed a completely opposite trend in our results (Fig.  4). However, recent friction and heating experiments conducted with pure CM or CM-bearing samples have demonstrated increases in the ID/IG ratios of CM with increasing temperature (e.g., Furuichi et al. 2015; Hirono et al. 2015; Kaneki et al. 2016, 2018; Ito et al. 2017). Furthermore, Mukoyoshi et al. (2018) reported {{an increase in the}} ID/IG ratios of CM in a natural pseudotachylyte-bearing slip zone relative to the ratios in host-rock samples. These contradictory results might be explained by heterogeneity of the initial condition of the CMs among these studies. For example, Kuo et al. (2017) obtained lower ID/IG ratios for anthracite samples in a high-velocity friction experiment, whereas Furuichi et al. (2015) reported an increase in the ID/IG ratios of brown coal in a similar friction experiment. If it is assumed that the direction of change in the ID/IG ratios of Raman spectra with increasing temperature depends on the <b>initial</b> <b>maturity</b> of the starting CM (e.g., Kouketsu et al. 2014, 2017; Schito et al. 2017), the increasing ID/IG ratios of the Raman spectra of CM with increasing temperature in our study might be attributable to the relatively low maturity of the starting CM (bituminous coal). Thus, to characterize fully the temperature–maturity relationship, further friction and heating experiments and organochemical analyses should be performed using CM samples with various initial maturities.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} project {{looked at the}} factors involved in developing an effective IT graduate or internship programme within a NZ organisation. To determine these factors, {{it was necessary to}} gain the perspectives of existing IT employees, IT management and the engineering graduates within the company. There was evidence to suggest that there is a supply and demand issue in the number of student enrolments versus the number of people employed in IT professions (McCullum, 2006). In support of a New Zealand knowledge-based IT workforce, programmes have been developed to link academic graduates with industry. In order to achieve an internally sustainable IT workforce, many organisations promote and run graduate or internship programmes. On the surface, {{it would seem that the}} majority of the research carried out in this area is from the perspective of the academic institution or from the perspective of the IT graduate student. Prior research would indicate that there is little known about the capabilities of an organisation in supporting a programme and the graduate participants. This {{research project}} looked at the subject area from the perspective of the organisation. This is a qualitative perception-based study using a case study method. IT managers and engineering graduates at a leading New Zealand utility infrastructure organisation shared their experiences and perceptions in regards to graduate and internship programmes. An online survey of IT staff members helped to triangulate and support the findings from the face-to-face interviews. A conceptual framework emerged based on the components and relationships derived from the literature review, IT management and engineering graduate interviews. Using the conceptual framework, participant responses were analysed to determine how mature the organisation was in adopting a graduate or internship programme. The People Capability Maturity Model (P-CMM) process elements served as a basis for measuring the organisation’s graduate and internship maturity. Participants strongly believed that employing an intern or graduate would benefit the organisation, that there were significant learning opportunities, providing the work was on offer and the individual and supervisor were well supported. The study found that the organisation was at an <b>initial</b> <b>maturity</b> level of one in regards to a graduate or internship programme, compared to the existing engineering graduate programme that was nearing a defined maturity level of three.
