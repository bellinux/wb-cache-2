As his career has progressed, he has begun to incorporate a more attacking approach to his play, which <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> greater number of goals and assists, and his six goals from midfield made him Manchester City's leading scorer in the 2006–07 season, ahead of strikers Georgios Samaras, Bernardo Corradi, Émile Mpenza and Darius Vassell.|$|E
5|$|Erosion {{within the}} last century <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> falls that is fairly {{narrowly}} channeled and vigorous, notably after a heavy rain. Photographs of the waterfall from the 19th century show a much wider, curtain like character to the falls. When the creek is dry, the older, much-broader ledge can be observed. If there were sufficient interest and funding, some remedial work could theoretically restore the 19th century appearance of the falls.|$|E
5|$|Research in {{the early}} 2000s {{combining}} the use of phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences and more traditional morphology-based characters <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reshuffling of the species concept in Gomphus; as a result, G.clavatus is considered the only Gomphus species in North America. Comparison of the DNA sequences of species Gomphus brevipes and Gomphus truncatus has shown them to be genetically identical to G.clavatus, {{and they may be}} treated as synonyms.|$|E

5|$|Human {{impact on}} the {{environment}} <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increase <b>in</b> the intrabreeding between species, with introduced species worldwide, which <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>an</b> increase <b>in</b> hybridization. The genetic mixing may threaten many species with extinction, while genetic erosion in crop plants may be damaging the gene pools of many species for future breeding. Many commercially useful fruits, flowers, garden herbs and trees have been produced by hybridization. One flower, Oenothera lamarckiana, was central to early genetics research into mutationism and polyploidy.|$|R

5|$|Although many Lilium {{species such}} as Lilium martagon and Lilium candidum can be {{obtained}} commercially, the majority of commercially available lilies represent the products of a very diverse hybridisation program, which <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> separate horticultural classification, including such groupings as Asian, Oriental and Orienpet. In addition to a very wide variety of heights, lilies can be obtained in many colours and combinations of colours, and if properly selected can produce an extensive blooming season from early summer to autumn. Because {{of the history of}} Liliaceae, many {{species such as}} Watsonia (bugle lily) that were previously classified in this family bear the name 'lily' but are neither part of the genus Lilium, or the Liliaceae family.|$|E
5|$|Increases in {{the number}} of CAT operations, and {{in the number}} of {{airports}} they operate from, <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> corresponding increase in Class A controlled airspace. Between 1997 and 2006 this area grew in size from 13 per cent of all airspace to 22 per cent nationally, and from 24 per cent to 43 per cent in airspace above England and Wales, leading to a perception within the GA community of being squeezed out. There are particular problems for GA around large airports, where Class A controlled airspace extends to ground level. The concentration of commercial operations and high demand for GA in the South East of England have also resulted in extensive areas of Class A controlled airspace there, which serve to channel uncontrolled GA operations through high-collision-risk hot spots.|$|E

A special train for invited guests and reporters inaugurated the run with on 11 September 2015. This inaugural train was hauled by FS Class 625 steam locomotive 625-017, built in 1915. The same engine was used by the Italian royal family, and also hauled the train which carried Pope John XXIII to Loreto and Assisi in 1962. Scheduled trains use contemporary suburban rolling stock to travel from Vatican City railway station to Albano Laziale, via Castel Gandolfo.|$|E
5|$|Stream erosion {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in dissecting the mountain range, and many of its peaks are dotted with glaciers. This dissection <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> variety of landforms, such as valleys, crags and domes. Small graveled creeks flow from alpine mountains out onto the regional prairies where there are pale blue rock-bottomed lakes, including the so-named Itcha Lake. Three streams drain the Itcha Range, namely Corkscrew Creek, Downton Creek and Shag Creek. Although the Itcha Range has been dissected by stream erosion and subsequently glaciated, its original shape has been largely preserved. Rocks in the Itcha Range are a variety of colours, including red, white and yellow.|$|E
5|$|The Vatican City {{station has}} no {{regularly}} scheduled passenger trains. Pope Francis's desire {{to open the}} Church's treasures to the public <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> weekly special train from Vatican City Station that {{is open to the}} public and is provided by the Vatican Museums and the Italian railway. Starting from September 12, 2015, on each Saturday, visitors to the Vatican Museums can board a train and travel to the Pontifical Villas in Castel Gandolfo. There, passengers can tour the newly created museum and visit the pontifical gardens as well as visit the town. The tour returns the same afternoon to the station of Roma San Pietro. The trains use contemporary suburban rolling stock to travel from Vatican City railway station to Albano Laziale, via Castel Gandolfo.|$|E

5|$|The {{location}} {{and history of}} Sarawak <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> broad diversity of ethnicity, culture and languages. Among the indigenous peoples of Sarawak, outside influences have led to many changes over time. The Iban tribal culture in Sarawak centred {{on the concept of}} the warrior and the ability to take heads from other tribes in battle. This practice, central as it was to the Iban people, was made illegal under James Brooke's rule and ultimately faded away although reminders of the practice are still seen in some long houses. Two other tribal peoples of the Sarawak Highlands, the Kelabit and Lun Bawang, have seen fundamental changes to their ethnic identities {{as a direct result of}} their conversion to Christianity. One major change was the shift in the focal point of their social interactions from the traditional long house to the local church. Their religious devotion has also helped shape their worldview outside of their village, particularly in response to change. For the Penan people, one of the last tribes to still be practising a nomadic lifestyle within the jungle, outside influence, particularly education, <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> significant decline in the population that practice the nomadic lifestyle. Others settle down after intermixing with members of different tribes, such as the Orang Ulu. One direct result of this diversity in cultures, engendered by a policy of tolerance to all races, is the increasing numbers of tribal peoples marrying not only other Sarawakian tribes, but also to Chinese, Malays as well as citizens of European or American descent.|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the Variscan mountain-building, the Mendip area now {{comprises}} at least four anticlinal fold structures, with an east-west trend, each with a core of older Devonian sandstone and Silurian volcanic rocks. The latter are quarried for use in road construction and as a concrete aggregate. The Mendips were considerably higher and steeper 200 to 300million years ago, and subsequent erosion <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> range of surface features including gorges, dry valleys, screes, swallets and others typical of karst landscapes. These are complemented underground by a large number of caves both beneath the plateau and {{at the base of the}} southern escarpment. Wookey Hole is one example of the caves of the area. There are also areas of limestone pavement and other karst features. Dissolution of the limestone produced many of the gorges including Cheddar Gorge and Burrington Combe. Springs are a common feature of the eastern part of the hills, a number of which have associated tufa deposits.|$|E

5|$|Humans play a {{key role}} in the biosphere, with the large human {{population}} dominating many of Earth's ecosystems. This <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> widespread, ongoing mass extinction of other species during the present geological epoch, now known as the Holocene extinction. The large-scale loss of species caused by human influence since the 1950s has been called a biotic crisis, with an estimated 10% of the total species lost as of 2007. At current rates, about 30% of species are at risk of extinction in the next hundred years. The Holocene extinction event is the result of habitat destruction, the widespread distribution of invasive species, hunting, and climate change. In the present day, human activity has had a significant impact on the surface of the planet. More than a third of the land surface has been modified by human actions, and humans use about 20% of global primary production. The concentration of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere has increased by close to 30% since the start of the Industrial Revolution.|$|E
5|$|It {{was once}} {{suggested}} {{that the relationship between}} the obligate and regular ant-followers and the army ants, particularly Eciton burchellii, was mutualistic, with the ants benefiting by having the birds chase prey back down towards them. However, experiments where ant followers were excluded have shown that the foraging success of the army ants was 30% lower when the birds were present, suggesting that the birds' relationship was in fact parasitic. This <b>has</b> <b>resulted</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> number of behaviours by the ants in order to reduce kleptoparasitism, including hiding of secured prey in the leaf litter and caching of food on trails. It has been {{suggested that the}} depressive effect of this parasitism slows the development of E. burchellii swarms and in turn benefits other ant species which are preyed upon by army ants. The ant-following antbirds are themselves followed by three species of butterfly in the family Ithomiinae which feed on their droppings. Bird droppings are usually an unpredictable resource in a rainforest, but the regular behaviour of ant followers makes the exploitation of this resource possible.|$|E
5|$|List of United States {{business}} school rankings is a tabular listing {{of some of}} the {{business school}}s and their affiliated universities located in the United States that are included in {{one or more of the}} rankings of full-time Master of Business Administration programs. Rankings are typically published by magazines or websites. This list is not a comprehensive list of business schools in the United States. These rankings are a subset of college and university rankings. Business schools are university-level institutions generally affiliated with a university or college that produces students who attain business administration degrees. Most of the schools listed in the rankings below are accredited by the Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of Business. Some of the publications shown here have related rankings for undergraduate, part-time and executive curricula. There is currently some controversy among faculty and administrators in American institutions of higher education regarding the request by the surveyors to have college presidents give their subjective opinion of other colleges because some of the methodologies are deemed misleading and a disservice.
