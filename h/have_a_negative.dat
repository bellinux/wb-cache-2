5|$|When the sinoatrial {{cells are}} resting, they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> charge on their membranes. However a rapid influx of sodium ions causes the membrane's charge to become positive. This is called {{depolarisation}} and occurs spontaneously. Once the cell has a sufficiently high charge, the sodium channels close and calcium ions then begin {{to enter the}} cell, shortly after which potassium begins to leave it. All the ions travel through ion channels in the membrane of the sinoatrial cells. The potassium and calcium only start {{to move out of}} and into the cell once it has a sufficiently high charge, and so are called voltage-gated. Shortly after this, the calcium channels close and potassium channels open, allowing potassium to leave the cell. This causes the cell to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> resting charge and is called repolarization. When the membrane potential reaches approximately −60 mV, the potassium channels close and the process may begin again.|$|E

5|$|During a sandstorm, the {{wind-blown sand}} {{particles}} become electrically charged. Such electric fields, which {{range in size}} up to 80 kV/m, can produce sparks and cause interference with telecommunications equipment. They are also unpleasant for humans and can cause headaches and nausea. The electric fields are caused by collision between airborne particles and by the impacts of saltating sand grains landing on the ground. The mechanism is little understood but the particles usually <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> charge when their diameter is under 250 μm and a positive one when they are over 500 μm.|$|E
5|$|Every atom is {{composed}} of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made {{of one or more}} protons and typically a similar number of neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive electric charge, the electrons <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> electric charge, and the neutrons have no electric charge. If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.|$|E

5|$|The mass balance, or {{difference}} between accumulation and ablation (melting and sublimation), of a glacier {{is crucial to}} its survival. Climate change may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, resulting in changes in mass balance. A glacier with a sustained negative balance loses equilibrium and retreats. A sustained positive balance is also out of equilibrium and will advance to reestablish equilibrium. Currently, nearly all glaciers <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> mass balance and are retreating.|$|E

They also provide important products like leather to humans. The wildebeest, however, can also <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> impact on humans. Wild individuals can be competitors of commercial livestock, and can transmit fatal diseases like rinderpest and cause epidemics among animals, particularly domestic cattle. They can also spread ticks, lungworms, tapeworms, flies and paramphistome flukes.|$|E

5|$|An individual's {{belief that}} an {{environmental}} claim lacks honesty can <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> effect on attitude toward a brand. If, {{on the other}} side, the consumer grants credibility to the claim, the individual will behave more respectfully toward the environment. The problem in extending that credibility to a brand is that consumers interested in ecological products generally are skeptical of commercial advertisements. This skepticism is due to {{various factors such as}} lack of language, the absence of scientific knowledge necessary to interpret advertising meaning, and, in particular, the falsehoods and exaggeration of some advertising techniques. To resolve this problem, independent organizations may choose to guarantee messages on the environmental benefits of brands with environmental labeling systems sponsored by independent organizations. This practice tries to diminish perceived biases in environmental information by promoting standardization of the information with the aim of improving confidence in the evaluation of environmental benefits of products—all of which should positively affect the purchase intention.|$|E
5|$|As word of {{the massacres}} got out, many Jews fled; in Ukraine, 70 to 90 per cent of the Jews ran away. This was seen by the leader of Einsatzkommando VI as beneficial, as it would save the regime the costs of deporting the victims further east over the Urals. In other areas the {{invasion}} was so successful that the Einsatzgruppen had insufficient forces to immediately kill all the Jews in the conquered territories. A situation report from Einsatzgruppe C in September 1941 noted that not all Jews {{were members of the}} Bolshevist apparatus, and suggested that the total elimination of Jewry would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> impact on the economy and the food supply. The Nazis began to round their victims up into concentration camps and ghettos and rural districts were for the most part rendered Judenfrei (free of Jews). Jewish councils were set up in major cities and forced labour gangs were established {{to make use of the}} Jews as slave labour until they were totally eliminated, a goal that was postponed until 1942.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{note the}} unusual {{contrast}} between {{his role as}} a partisan liberal Senator and {{his role as a}} conservative jurist. They attribute his shift in position as a reaction to the relationship between the New Deal senators and the conservative 1930s Court, which ruled much of the New Deal legislation unconstitutional. When Minton became a Supreme Court Justice, the Senate had become more conservative and the Court more activist, causing him to support conservative minority positions. As a Justice, Minton frequently played the role of peace-maker and consensus builder during a period when the Court was riven with feuds. He generally ruled in favor of order over freedom {{as a result of his}} broad interpretation of governmental powers. These rulings and their limited impact lead some historians to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> opinion of his judicial record. Other historians point out Minton's strong commitment to his judicial principles as a valuable attribute. In 1962, the Sherman Minton Bridge in southern Indiana and the Minton-Capehart Federal Building in Indianapolis were named in his honor.|$|E
