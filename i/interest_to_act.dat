5000|$|Probes for {{northern}} blotting {{are composed of}} nucleic acids with a complementary sequence to {{all or part of}} the RNA of interest, they can be DNA, RNA, or oligonucleotides with a minimum of 25 complementary bases to the target sequence. [...] RNA probes (riboprobes) that are transcribed in vitro are able to withstand more rigorous washing steps preventing some of the background noise. [...] Commonly cDNA is created with labelled primers for the RNA sequence of <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> as the probe in the northern blot. [...] The probes must be labelled either with radioactive isotopes (32P) or with chemiluminescence in which alkaline phosphatase or horseradish peroxidase (HRP) break down chemiluminescent substrates producing a detectable emission of light. [...] The chemiluminescent labelling can occur in two ways: either the probe is attached to the enzyme, or the probe is labelled with a ligand (e.g. biotin) for which the ligand (e.g., avidin or streptavidin) is attached to the enzyme (e.g. HRP). [...] X-ray film can detect both the radioactive and chemiluminescent signals and many researchers prefer the chemiluminescent signals because they are faster, more sensitive, and reduce the health hazards that go along with radioactive labels. [...] The same membrane can be probed up to five times without a significant loss of the target RNA.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to defend the view that Kant has propounded an internalist theory of moral motivation. In particular, I shall argue that Kant’s espousal of internalism is {{evidenced}} by his claim that pure reason’s relation to the will is premised on a practical synthetic a priori proposition. What I aim to demonstrate is that Kant treated practical syntheticity as a pivotal concept for his account of what it means to be motivated by principles of pure reason. On my construal of Kant’s motivational theory, the relation between universalizable maxims and the moral <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> upon them is necessary but non-tautological, since violations of duty are logically possible despite our having a moral reason to act. What prevents the latter argument from collapsing into a quasiexternalist account of moral motivation is that the motivational impact of law-like maxims is ultimately premised on a normative conception of ourselves as free agents...|$|E

30|$|The {{self-determination}} theory (SDT) of Deci and Ryan (1985, 1993) {{has been}} applied in many research fields as an approach to human motivation and personality (Ryan & Deci, 2017). As a part of online learning along with gamification, {{it has been used}} as a framework to investigate student’s motivation and engagement (Dichev, Dicheva, Angelova, & Agre, 2015; Lamprinou & Paraskeva, 2015; Sailer, Hense, Mayr, & Mandl, 2017; Shi & Cristea, 2016). SDT differentiates between types of motivation, gives explanations for motivational behavior and proposes predictors of high-quality learning. Intrinsic motivation is considered the most beneficial type of motivation as it is associated with activities that are done for fun and pleasure and satisfaction. In our case study, this regulation type is observed when students enjoy and have fun collecting badges. Identified motivation is observed when individuals engage in a behavior because they think it is important to them. Students collect badges since they believe collecting them is an important and valuable activity for them. Both intrinsic and identified regulations are self-determined and autonomous forms of motivation. Extrinsic motivation is exhibited when the reasons for performing a task are externally influenced, either because the task is an obligation or must be completed in order to avoid punishment. It represents a non-autonomous form of motivation. Students exhibit this regulation type when they collect badges because they are obliged to do so by the instructor. Finally, amotivation shows unwillingness or the state of lacking the <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> (Ryan & Deci, 2000). Individuals do not care about a task and/or do not feel competent in accomplishing it. This regulation type is shown when students are not interested in collecting badges and/or do not feel competent in accomplishing the connected tasks.|$|E
40|$|When {{the case}} for {{organizational}} change {{is presented as a}} “vision,” is action to support the change more likely? This notion was tested in two studies in the context of diversity issues at work. Diversity was selected as the context because Canadian workplaces are becoming increasingly diverse, and organizations are confronted with the challenge of addressing diversity issues appropriately and effectively. Moreover, theoretically critical features of visions, such as a connection with personal values, may be present in a vision of diversity. It was hypothesized that a vision—a picture of a desirable future state—may be more effective when it is aligned with individuals’ self interests and personal values. In Study 1, small groups of undergraduate male and female students (N= 221) were presented with a vision of a proposed Employment Equity (EE) program that focused on raising women's employment rates. Self-interest was captured in the design as the interaction of participant gender with extent of employment change for women (small vs. large) resulting from the implementation of the EE program. Value orientation was captured by participants’ importance ranking of social justice on a pre-study measure. Verifying the self interest manipulation, men were seen to perceive that this program would influence their career advancement negatively and this effect was significantly stronger in the condition with the large increase in women’s employment. The most striking finding emerged with the three-way interaction between gender, social justice orientation, and the extent of employment change condition as these variables affected participants’ willingness to support the proposed EE program. Men who placed lower value on social justice showed a straightforward self-interest effect, with lowest support for the policy occurring when the increase in the women’s employment rate was greater. In contrast, men with higher social justice value were more favourable toward the policy that produced a greater change in women’s employment rates. For these men, personal values seemed to trump self-interests. Results involving positive affect mirrored the pattern of these results. Compared to a small employment increase for women, a large mandated increase in women’s employment led men who placed lower value on social justice to report feeling less positive. However, men who placed higher value on social justice reported feeling more positive when the mandated increase in women’s employment was large. Study 2 further examined the role of values in responding to a vision involving diversity. It was hypothesized that when values guide behaviour, the underlying motivation is relatively autonomous. That is, instead of yielding to guilt or social pressure, the values-guided person acts to attain identity fulfillment. To investigate this matter, undergraduate students (N= 475) were randomly assigned to watch either a visionary presentation about promoting workforce diversity or a business case presentation. The visionary presentation described a prejudice-free, inclusive workplace; the business case covered the legalities of diversity. It was found that participants whose values were diversity-oriented felt more “inspired” than other participants overall, and this effect was significantly stronger in the vision condition. The primary difference in findings between experimental conditions involved the association between a measure of autonomous motivation and participants’ reports of intended action. A positive, significant association was obtained in the vision condition; no significant association was obtained with the business case. These results are understandable from the conditional nature of autonomous motivation as assessed here. That is, in both conditions, some people (i. e., autonomously motivated people) said that if they acted to promote diversity, it would be in order to promote their personal values. However, {{it was only in the}} vision condition in which the connection of diversity-promotion action to personal values was made salient. Thus it appears that a vision can influence behaviour by inducing autonomously motivated people to recognize this connection. The vision was not more influential overall in motivating participants to support the proposed cause. Nonetheless results indicated that a vision can be a complementary tool in a diversity change implementation by sparking an <b>interest</b> <b>to</b> <b>act</b> within the right people. Taken together, the findings from these two studies indicate that a key way a vision motivates behaviour is by forging the link between values and a course of action...|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{investigates the}} nature and {{regulation}} of the international practices of large commercial law firms. The overseas work of City solicitors, German commercial lawyers and US corporate lawyers is examined; almost seventy interviews were undertaken with lawyers and regulators based within the jurisdictions of England and Wales and Germany. A wide variety of literature, ranging from the fields of globalisation and regulation to the sociology of the professions, contextualises the empirical research. It is argued that the processes of globalisation have intensified within {{the last quarter of}} this century. The heightened internationalisation of business has impacted upon the worlds of many professionals, including those of lawyers in large law firms. Many of the largest law firms are moving to more commercialised forms of practice, where entrepreneurship is highly valued. Indeed, {{one of the reasons why}} foreign offices are opened is to take advantage of "green-field" sites abroad. However, law firms' strategies do vary; the thesis aims to tease out some of the differences in the international practices of the law firms investigated. In so doing, it cautions against over-generalising when discussing the overseas strategies and experience of "mega-law firms". Nevertheless, international developments do test the limits of current regulation. Large law firms often operate beyond the regulatory concerns of professional associations yet several features of their practice are worrying. For instance, the tendency of commercial lawyers not to consider anything other than their clients' immediate <b>interests</b> (<b>to</b> <b>act</b> as "hired guns") calls into question the legitimacy of regulatory systems.
