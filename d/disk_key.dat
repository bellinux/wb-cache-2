40|$|Information leakage has {{recently}} become {{a serious problem}} and most often a result of actions inside rather than outside the system that should be protecting the information. Although system administrators have high access authority, they should not know the <b>disk</b> encryption <b>keys</b> of users because {{they may not be}} authorized to read a user's sensitive information. Information leakage from a disk in a managed network (e. g., an enterprise network) is generally prevented by encrypting either the entire disk or just the confidential files stored on it. Since this encryption uses highly secure. Symmetric-key encryption algorithms, however, it is not easy for a user to memorize the random numbers constituting the <b>disk</b> encryption <b>key.</b> So it is important not only to encrypt the disk data but also to store the <b>disk</b> encryption <b>key</b> securely.

In analogy with direct measurements of the turbulent Reynolds stress (turbulent viscosity) that governs momentum transport, we have measured the turbulent electromotive force (emf) by simultaneously measuring three components of velocity and magnetic fields, and computed the correlations that lead to mean-field current generation. Furthermore, we show that this turbulent emf tends to oppose and cancel out the local current, acting to increase the effective resistivity of the medium, i. e., it acts as an enhanced magnetic diffusivity.

We {{calculate}} the visual light curve of CAL 87 {{based on the}} assumption that an accreting steadily burning white dwarf irradiates the accretion disk and the secondary star, as suggested by van den Heuvel et al.

We find a reasonable fit including the following sources of visual light: 1. the secondary star where the energy from irradiation is spread out over the surface, 2. the accretion disk with an optically thick, cold, clumpy spray presumably caused by an accretion stream of high mass flow rate impinging on the disk (hot spot). This spray moving around the disk can account for the asymmetry in the light curve and the depth of the secondary minimum.

Using this guaranteed throughput {{in the design}} of multimedia systems, one can admit more streams or get smaller buffer requirements and guaranteed response times than when an existing lower bound is used. We consider the case that nothing can be assumed about the location of the requests on the disk. Furthermore, we assume that successive batches are handled one after the other, where the n requests in a batch are retrieved using a SCAN-based sweep strategy. We show that we only have to consider two successive batches to determine the guaranteed throughput.

40|$|Abstract. The optical-ultraviolet {{continuum}} {{from active}} galactic nuclei (AGN) seems to originate from optically thick and/or thin disks, and occasionally from associated circumnuclear starburst regions. These different possible origins can, in principle, be distinguished by observations of gravitational microlensing events. We performed numerical simulations of microlensing of an AGN disk {{by a single}} lensing star passing {{in front of the}} AGN. Calculated spectral variations and light curves show distinct behavior, depending {{on the nature of the}} emitting region; time variation over few months with strong wavelength dependence is expected in the case of an optically thick disk (standard disk), while an optically thin disk (advection-dominated disk) will produce shorter, nearly wavelength-independent variation. In the case of an associated circumnuclear starburst region much slower variations (over a year) will be superposed on the shorter variations caused by microlensing of the <b>disk.</b> <b>Key</b> words: accretion, accretion disks – galaxies: active – galaxies: nuclei – galaxies: quasars: general – gamma rays: bursts 1...|$|E

We reexamine {{arguments}} {{advanced by}} Hayashi & Matsuda (2001), {{who claim that}} several simple, physically motivated derivations based on mean free path theory for calculating the viscous torque in a quasi-Keplerian accretion disk yield results that are inconsistent with the generally accepted model. If correct, the ideas proposed by Hayashi & Matsuda would radically alter {{our understanding of the}} nature of the angular momentum transport in the disk, which is a central feature of accretion disk theory. However, in this paper we point out several fallacies in their arguments and show that there indeed exists a simple derivation based on mean free path theory that yields an expression for the viscous torque that is proportional to the radial derivative of the angular velocity in the accretion disk, as expected. The derivation is based on the analysis of the epicyclic motion of gas parcels in adjacent eddies in the <b>disk.</b> <b>Key</b> words. Accretion—viscosity, disks, angular momentum. 1...|$|E
