40|$|A {{miniature}} multifunction {{rotating machinery}} shaft displacement sensor {{designed for a}} turbopump health monitoring system is described. The sensor probe tip has three independent sensing electrodes running <b>in</b> a <b>groove</b> made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> of <b>the</b> machine. One of these electrodes, situated {{at the tip of}} the sensor, measures the radial displacement of <b>the</b> <b>shaft,</b> while <b>the</b> two side electrodes measure the axial displacements of the sides of the groove. The displacement sensor is also used to measure speed, by providing a notch <b>in</b> <b>the</b> side of the groove facing one sensor electrode. Results obtained with experimental sensors demonstrated that multifunction capacitive sensing is practical and reduces instrumentation penetration into rotating machinery housings...|$|R
50|$|To {{launch the}} arrow, the thrower uses {{a length of}} string that is longer than {{the length of the}} arrow itself. A knot is tied in one end of the string, and this is placed into <b>the</b> notch or <b>groove</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> arrow <b>shaft.</b> <b>The</b> rest of the string is then passed around <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> once, and is made to align over and above the knot before being {{stretched}} down to the point end of the arrow. The string is tightened, ensuring that the knotted end stays within the notch, and the surplus is wound around the thrower's throwing hand. The throwing hand with the string wound around it should be near the point end of the arrow, with the thrower able to easily grip the end.|$|R
40|$|Although in {{scientific}} literature there are studies regarding {{the inclusion of}} relief <b>grooves</b> <b>in</b> order to diminish the amount of stress concentration <b>in</b> stepped <b>shafts,</b> <b>the</b> incorporation of optimization algorithms capable of parametrically determining their geometry remains unexplored. In this paper, an approach {{to the problem of}} size optimization of shoulder filleted shafts with relief grooves and subject to axial loads is presented. The objective of the optimization is to minimize the maximum value of stress at both, the root of the shoulder fillet, and the root of the groove, thus minimizing stress concentration and improving fatigue life of such elements. Under this methodology, different percentages of reduction of stress are achieved for <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> with relief <b>grooves,</b> <b>in</b> comparison with <b>the</b> <b>shafts</b> without relief grooves. The novelty of this approach lies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> incorporation of an algorithm for the determination of the optimum geometry of the grooves...|$|R
40|$|Micro-abrasion {{techniques}} {{enable the}} surface wear of materials {{to be studied}} with greater precision than provided by other methods. In addition to their reliability, micro-abrasion techniques allow the wear phenomenon of the top-most layers to be studied while assuring, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case of thin coatings, {{that this is not}} influenced by <b>the</b> substrate. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> present study, micro-abrasion technique (cratering with a steel ball) was used to determine the wear resistance of traditional ceramic materials, as a complementary test to the methodologies on a macroscopic scale that are customarily used for this type of material. In order to adapt the test to these materials, the individual effect of each test condition on wear resistance was isolated, while keeping the other conditions constant. The following variables were studied: diameter and angular velocity of the ball, abrasive suspension feed rate and grain size, sample-ball contact angle and <b>groove</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supporting drive <b>shaft.</b> <b>The</b> values established were validated by performance of the test on materials of a glassy nature. The micro-abrasion test is shown to be a useful method for studying wear performance of ceramic glazes. Â© 2009 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe 1 / 15 reduced-scale {{experiments}} were conducted using the Froude number conservation to investigate smoke diffusion characteristics in tunnel fires with natural ventilation. The effects of some factors such as: heat release rate, shaft distance, shaft size, train blockage and smoke curtain were studied. A porous bed propane burner, {{placed on the}} tunnel floor, was used to simulate the fire source. A series of K- type thermocouples were used to measure tunnel ceiling smoke temperatures. A hotwire anemometer {{was used to measure}} smoke volume rate and smoke temperature <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ventilation <b>shaft.</b> <b>The</b> experimental results indicated that all factors, except for the smoke curtain, have no major effect on the dimensionless ceiling temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire section of the tunnel. Moreover, the fire size and train blockage do not {{have a significant effect on}} the dimensionless ceiling temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-fire section of the tunnel. Nevertheless, the dimensionless ceiling temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> non-fire section of the tunnel decreased with the decrease of <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> distance and <b>the</b> increase of <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> size. When <b>the</b> smoke curtain is used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> tunnel, the dimensionless ceiling temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fire channel are higher than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> case when the smoke curtain is not used. Moreover, there is no smoke <b>in</b> <b>the</b> evacuation channel. The fire size and train blockage do not have a considerable effect on the dimensionless temperatures and smoke volume rates <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft.</b> Nonetheless, <b>the</b> dimensionless smoke temperatures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> decrease with <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> distance or <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> size. Moreover, dimensionless smoke flow rates through <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> increase with <b>the</b> decrease <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> distance or <b>the</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>shaft</b> size...|$|R
