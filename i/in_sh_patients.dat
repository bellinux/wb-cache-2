40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{cross-sectional}} study was to evaluate the cardiovascular risk in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) and metabolic syndrome (MetS) components. The study included 60 patients with SH and a control group of 60 healthy volunteers, gender and age matched, with normal thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) and free thyroxin (FT 4) concentration. The following measurements were made in all participants: TSH, FT 4, thyroid peroxidase antibodies, anti-thyroglobulin antibodies, body mass index (BMI), waist circumference, blood pressure, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, triglycerides (TG), TC/HDL cholesterol and LDL/HDL cholesterol ratio, basal insulin level and homeostatic model assessment insulin resistance (HOMA-IR) index. MetS was diagnosed according to the National Cholesterol Education Program Adult Treatment Panel III criteria. The {{results showed that the}} following indices were statistically significantly higher in the SH group: BMI (p < 0. 05), diastolic blood pressure (p < 0. 001), TC (p < 0. 05), TG (p < 0. 05) and basal insulin level (p < 0. 05). Although MetS parameters were present in a higher per cent in the SH group, there was a significantly higher number of patients with hypertension and decreased HDL cholesterol (p < 0. 05). More frequently, MetS was diagnosed <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> <b>patients</b> (46. 67 %) than in the control group (33. 33 %), although the difference was not statistically significant. These results indicated that the traditional cardiovascular risk factors were more frequently present <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> <b>patients</b> as compared to euthyroid participants.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{subclinical}} hypothyroidism (SH) on cardiovascular autonomic function and ventricular repolarization {{has not been}} yet elucidated. The aim {{of the present study}} was to evaluate the dispersion of QT interval, i. e. an index of inhomogeneity of repolarization, and heart rate variability (HRV), i. e. a measure of cardiac autonomic modulation, <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> <b>patients.</b> METHODS: The study included 42 patients (29 women and 13 men; mean age 53. 2 +/- 14. 2 years; body surface area 1. 76 +/- 0. 14 m 2) with SH, as judged by elevated serum TSH levels (> 3. 6 mIU/l; range, 3. 8 - 12. 0) and normal free thyroid hormones (FT 4 and FT 3) and 30 euthyroid volunteer. Subjects with cardiac, metabolic, neurological disease or any other systemic disease that could affect autonomic activity were excluded from the study. Patients with SH and control subjects underwent a full history, physical examination, standard 12 -lead ECG, and 24 -h ambulatory ECG monitoring. To evaluate the effect of treatment with L-thyroxine on QT dispersion and HRV, 15 patients with SH were randomly assigned to receive therapy with L-thyroxine. All the subjects were evaluated at enrolment and after 6 months. RESULTS: Patients with SH showed higher QT dispersion and lower HRV measures than healthy controls (P< 0. 01 for all). <b>In</b> <b>SH</b> <b>patients,</b> the standard deviation of N-Ns (SDNN) was negatively related to TSH (r=- 0. 42, P= 0. 006), while low frequency (LF) /high frequency (HF) ratio was positively related to TSH (r= 0. 42, P= 0. 006). Moreover, <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> <b>patients</b> both QT dispersion and QTc dispersion were positively related to TSH (r= 0. 64 and r= 0. 63, P< 0. 001 for both). After 6 months, the patients treated with L-tiroxine exhibited a reduction of QT dispersion and an increase of HRV parameters. CONCLUSION: The results of the present study demonstrated that SH can alter autonomic modulation of heart rate and cause increased inhomogeneity of ventricular recovery times. Accordingly, early L-thyroxine treatment may be advised not only to prevent progression to overt hypothyroidism but also to improve abnormal cardiac autonomic function and ventricular repolarization inhomogeneity...|$|E
40|$|To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between electroencephalographic (EEG) activity and hypoglycemia unawareness, we investigated early parameters of vigilance and awareness of various symptom categories in response to hypoglycemia in intensively treated type 1 diabetic (T 1 DM) patients with different degrees of hypoglycemia unawareness. Hypoglycemia was induced with a hyperinsulinemic-hypoglycemic clamp in six T 1 DM patients with a history of hypoglycemia unawareness previous severe hypoglycemic coma (SH) and in six T 1 DM patients without (C) history of hypoglycemia unawareness previous severe hypoglycemic coma. Cognitive function tests (four choice reaction time), counterregulatory responses (adrenaline), and symptomatic responses were evaluated at euglycemia (90  mg/dl) and during step-wise plasma glucose reduction (68, 58 and 49  mg/dl). EEG activity was recorded continuously throughout the study and analyzed by spectral analysis. Cognitive function deteriorated significantly at a glucose threshold of 55  ±  1  mg/dl in both groups (p = ns) during hypoglycemia, while the glucose threshold for autonomic symptoms was significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> <b>patients</b> than in C patients (49  ±  1 vs. 54  ±  1  mg/dl, p <  0. 05, respectively). <b>In</b> <b>SH</b> <b>patients,</b> eye-closed resting EEG showed a correlation between the mean dominance frequency and plasma glucose (r =  0. 62, p <  0. 001). Theta relative power increased during controlled hypoglycemia compared to euglycemia (21. 6  ±  6 vs. 15. 5  ±  3 % Hz p <  0. 05) and was higher than in the C group (21. 6  ±  6 vs. 13. 8  ±  3 %, p <  0. 03). The cognitive task beta activity was lower in the SH group than in the C group (14. 8  ±  3  Hz, vs. 22. 6  ±  4 vs. p <  0. 03). Controlled hypoglycemia elicits cognitive dysfunction in both C and SH patients; however, significant EEG alterations during hypoglycemia were detected mainly in patients with a history of hypoglycemia unawareness and previous severe hypoglycemic coma.

40|$|We {{read with}} {{interest}} the article on the evaluation of endothelial function in subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) and subclinical hyperthyroidism (SHr) by Cikim et al. (1). As the authors state, SH may have adverse effects on endothelial function independent from other well-known atherosclerotic risk factors such as dyslipidemia. Indeed, the association of SH with changes in serum lipoprotein profile {{and the effect of}} Levothyroxine replacement therapy on these changes are still open questions (2 – 4). We also agree with the authors that endothelial dysfunction, a condition characterized by decreased nitric oxide availability, plays a pivotal role in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease (5). However, the authors state that endothelial impairment has not been clearly demonstrated in mild thyroid dysfunction. We had previously demonstrated a reversible alteration of endothelium dependent vasodilatation and reduced nitric oxide availability <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> <b>patients</b> (6). The study population included 14 SH patients and 28 euthyroid controls, matched to the patient group for sex, age and body mass index and divided, according to the lipid profile, into a normocholesterolemic (n 14) and a slightly hypercholesterolemic group (n 14, matched to SH patients). Our results indicated that the endothelial impairment of SH patients cannot be accounted for exclusively by the concomitant mild hypercholesterolemia since endothelium dependent vasodilation was significantly reduced in comparison to both the control groups. Therefore, besides serum lipid alterations, we suggested a direct effect of thyroid hormone reduction in endothelial dysfunction development of SH patients...|$|E

40|$|BackgroundTo {{investigate}} whether {{a history of}} prior cardiovascular disease (CVD) is associated with severe hypoglycemia (<b>SH)</b> <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with type 2 diabetes. MethodsWe conducted a prospective cohort study from January 2001 to December 2012 with a median follow-up time of 9. 5 years (5, 814 person-years). Patients aged 25 to 75 years with type 2 diabetes and without chronic kidney disease were enrolled (n= 894), and 624 <b>patients</b> completed follow-up. <b>SH</b> was defined as hypoglycemic episodes requiring hospitalization or medical care in an emergency department. We used the Cox proportional hazards regression analysis to test associations between SH episodes and potential explanatory variables. ResultsAmong the 624 participants who completed follow-up, 60 patients (9. 6 %) had previous CVD. Compared to patients without CVD, patients with previous CVD were older, had a longer duration of diabetes and hypertension, received more insulin, and had more diabetic microvascular complications at baseline. During follow-up, 62 patients (9. 9 %) experienced at least one SH episode (incidence of 1. 33 per 100 patient-years).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} whether integrated backscatter (IBS) analysis combined with conventional ultrasonography could differentiate the tissue characteristics of carotid artery intimal hyperplasia in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (SH). METHODS: Forty-one patients with SH, as judged by elevated serum TSH levels and free thyroid hormones within the normal range, and 31 sex- and age-matched euthyroid volunteers underwent two-dimensional conventional ultrasonography and IBS analysis of the carotid wall. Carotid intima-media thickness (IMT) and corrected IBS (C-IBS), an index of arterial wall degeneration and fibrosis, were evaluated. RESULTS: Mean IMT as well C-IBS values were higher in SH than in controls (P < 0. 0001 for both), whereas the carotid diameter was not significantly different between the two groups. The distribution of C-IBS values in each group showed that regions with higher C-IBS values were found more frequently <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> <b>patients</b> than in control subjects. The percentage of regions that could be considered as fibromatous (C-IBS value from - 18 to - 21 dB) was 28 % in SH and 9 % in euthyroid subjects (P < 0. 0001). In the SH group, C-IBS values were significantly and positively associated with plasma TSH (r = 0. 32, P < 0. 05 and r = 0. 59, P < 0. 0001, respectively) and with both total cholesterol (r = 0. 46, P = 0. 01) and low density lipoprotein (LDL) -cholesterol (r = 0. 55, P = 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Carotid IMT in subclinically hypothyroid patients is higher than that in euthyroid controls.

40|$|Background. Hypothyroid {{patients}} may have several haemostatic abnormalities such as {{modification of the}} coagulation proteins and a bleeding tendency and conflicting data {{have been reported in}} this regard. Objectives. Aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate the alterations of fibrinogen and D-Dimer (D-D) in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) and in those with overt hypothyroidism (OH) before and after levothyroxine (L-T 4) treatment, and to compare them with those of euthyroid controls. Patients and methods. The study prospectively included 17 OH patients (TSH > 15 mU/l), 40 SH patients (TSH 3 - 15 mU/l) and 28 sex- and age-matched healthy controls. All hypothyroid patients had chronic Hashimoto’s thyroiditis. All patients were questioned about their current treatment, medical history and smoking habits. Their fibrinogen and D-D levels were evaluated before L-T 4 treatment and after 3 - 6 months, in euthyroid state. Results. No difference in mean fibrinogen levels was observed in OH and SH patients compared with the healthy controls. Mean D-D levels were found to be significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> <b>patients</b> (207. 4  187. 6) than in controls (146. 6  73. 2; p = 0. 01), but not in OH patients. It is worth noting that fibrinogen levels showed a significant increase when the euthyroid state was restored in OH patients (250  20. 6 vs 339  70. 7; p< 0. 005). Moreover, treatment did not affect D-D levels in SH and OH patients. Conclusions. These data suggest that both autoimmunity and thyroid failure, may concur in the modulation of fibrinogen in Hashimoto’s hypothyroidism. Higher fibrinogen levels due to chronic inflammation of autoimmune disease observed in OH only on L-T 4 treatment could be the consequence of reduced liver synthesis in the hypothyroid state. The D-D increase in SH may be due to a chronic inflammation of Hashimoto’s thyroiditis.

The prospective study included 79 patients with diagnosed AMI with ST-segment elevation (STEMI), admitted to the Coronary Care Unit of the Clinic for Cardiovascular Diseases, Clinical Centre Niš, from 2004 to 2007, who were indicated for temporary electrical cardiac pacing. The blood was sampled on admission for lab analysis, glucose levels were determined (as well as markers of myocardial necrosis - troponin I, CK-MB). Echocardiographic study was performed and ejection fraction was evaluated by using area length method. Results. The ROC analysis indicated that the best glycaemic level on admission, which {{could be used as a}} predictor of mortality, was 10. 00 mmol/l, and the area under the curve was 0. 82.

Patients were randomly assigned to receive or not L-thyroxine replacement therapy. All patients returned after 6 months to repeat thyroid function tests and the evaluation of all parameters. No significant differences were seen in the Sm peak between SH and control groups. Respect to controls, SH patients exhibited a lower E-m, a higher A(m), and, subsequently, a reduced E-m/A(m) ratio of both lateral wall (LW) and interventricular septum (IVS) (P < 0. 001 for both). The IVRTm was distinctly longer <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> <b>patients,</b> as compared to controls (P < 0. 001). At 6 months, L-thyroxine-treated patients showed a significant increase of E-m (P < 0. 01) and a subsequent increase of the E-m/A(m) ratio (P < 0. 01), whereas IVRTm significantly reduced (P < 0. 05). No significant change in any of these parameters was observed in the untreated group. Our data suggest that SH is associated with a subtle, reversible impairment of myocardial function. TDI analysis detects and extends these functional defects by displaying alterations in regional myocardial function. L-T- 4 replacement therapy should be advised for these patients with the aim to correct preclinical cardiac dysfunction and prevent the development of clinically significant myocardial dysfunction.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: The {{definition}} of subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) is an asymptomatic {{state in which}} free thyroxine (T 4) is normal and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels are elevated. Its relationship with coronary disease is not clear and {{has been the subject}} of recent interest. Current evidence is conflicting and there is a lack of studies supported by coronary angiography. OBJECTIVE: To assess the relationship between SH and the presence and extent of coronary disease diagnosed by angiography. METHODS: We prospectively studied 354 consecutive patients referred for elective coronary angiography. Those with known thyroid disease, documented coronary disease or previous myocardial infarction were excluded. Fasting blood specimens were collected to measure thyroid hormones, lipid profile, high-sensitivity C-reactive protein, fibrinogen and NT-proBNP. Patients with SH were compared with those without to assess differences in clinical characteristics and biochemical and angiographic results. Significant coronary disease was defined as the presence of at least one lesion with > or = 50 % luminal stenosis. Lesions with < 50 % stenosis were considered minimal. RESULTS: SH was diagnosed in 32 (9 %) patients. Mean age was similar between the groups. There were more women (66 % vs. 39 %; p= 0. 003) and atrial fibrillation was more frequent (25 % vs. 11 %; p= 0. 016) in the group of patients with SH. There were no significant differences in the other baseline clinical parameters, and blood biochemistry results were similar in the two groups, with the exception of higher levels of NT-proBNP <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> <b>patients,</b> although without statistical significance.

40|$|Background Self-harm (SH; {{intentional}} self-poisoning or self-injury) is common, often repeated, {{and strongly}} associated with suicide. This is an update of a broader Cochrane review on psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for deliberate SH, first published in 1998 and previously updated in 1999. We have now divided the review in to three separate reviews. This review is focused on pharmacological interventions in adults who self harm. Objectives To identify all randomised controlled trials of pharmacological agents or natural products for SH in adults, and to conduct meta-analyses (where possible) to compare the effects of specific treatments with comparison types of treatment (e. g., placebo/alternative pharmacological treatment) for SH patients. Search methods For this update the Cochrane Depression, Anxiety and Neurosis Review Group (CCDAN) Trials Search Co-ordinator searched the CCDAN Specialised Register (September 2014). Additional searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and CENTRAL were conducted to October 2013. Selection criteria We included randomised controlled trials comparing pharmacological treatments or natural products with placebo/alternative pharmacological treatment in individuals with a recent (within six months) episode of SH resulting in presentation to clinical services. Data collection and analysis We independently selected trials, extracted data, and appraised trial quality. For binary outcomes, we calculated odds ratios (ORs) and their 95 % confidence intervals (CIs). For continuous outcomes we calculated the mean difference (MD) and 95 % CI. Meta-analysis was only possible for one intervention (i. e. newer generation antidepressants) on repetition of SH at last follow-up. For this analysis, we pooled data using a random-effects model. The overall quality of evidence for the primary outcome was appraised for each intervention using the GRADE approach. Main results We included seven trials {{with a total of}} 546 patients. The largest trial included 167 participants. We found no significant treatment effect on repetition of SH for newer generation antidepressants (n = 243; k = 3; OR 0. 76, 95 % CI 0. 42 to 1. 36; GRADE: low quality of evidence), low-dose fluphenazine (n = 53; k = 1; OR 1. 51, 95 % CI 0. 50 to 4. 58; GRADE: very low quality of evidence), mood stabilisers (n = 167; k = 1; OR 0. 99, 95 % CI 0. 33 to 2. 95; GRADE: low quality of evidence), or natural products (n = 49; k = 1; OR 1. 33, 95 % CI 0. 38 to 4. 62; GRADE: low quality of evidence). A significant reduction in SH repetition was found in a single trial of the antipsychotic flupenthixol (n = 30; k = 1; OR 0. 09, 95 % CI 0. 02 to 0. 50), although the quality of evidence for this trial, according to the GRADE criteria, was very low. No data on adverse effects, other than the planned outcomes relating to suicidal behaviour, were reported. Authors’ conclusions Given the low or very low quality of the available evidence, and the small number of trials identified, {{it is not possible to}} make firm conclusions regarding pharmacological interventions <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> <b>patients.</b> More and larger trials of pharmacotherapy are required. In view of an indication of positive benefit for flupenthixol in an early small trial of low quality, these might include evaluation of newer atypical antipsychotics. Further work should include evaluation of adverse effects of pharmacological agents. Other research could include evaluation of combined pharmacotherapy and psychological treatment. <br /...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{evaluate}} i) {{the frequency}} of typical hypothyroidism symptoms in children with subclinical hypothyroidism (SH), ii) to evaluate the association of SH with lipoproteins and iii) to investigate possible improving effects of L-thyroxine (LT 4) treatment on these findings. Methods: Twenty-seven children with SH who had elevated thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH:> 4. 94 µIU/L) but normal free T 4 levels and healthy euthyroid children of similar age and sex {{were enrolled in the}} study. Anthropometric and laboratory (lipid profile and thyroid function tests) measurements were performed at diagnosis and six months after euthyroidism was achieved. All children were also subjected to a questionnaire on hypothyroid symptoms at diagnosis. The <b>SH</b> <b>patients</b> were subjected to the questionnaire also following treatment. Pre-treatment data were compared with those of controls and post-treatment measurements. Results: Anthropometric and laboratory parameters of the groups were not statistically different except for higher TSH levels <b>in</b> the <b>SH</b> group. Serum lipoprotein levels and dyslipidemia frequency were similar between the groups. Compared to the controls, hypothyroidism symptom score was significantly higher <b>in</b> the <b>SH</b> group. Six months after euthyroidism was achieved, a significant reduction in the hypothyroid symptom score was obtained <b>in</b> the <b>SH</b> group. Except for significantly higher serum TSH values, no significant differences regarding demographic characteristics, symptom scores and lipid parameters were present between patients with Hashimoto’s thyroiditis and the remaining <b>SH</b> <b>patients.</b> Conclusion: The results of this study showed that <b>in</b> children with <b>SH</b> i) the hypothyroidism symptom score was significantly higher than in euthyroid children, ii) LT 4 treatment improved the hypothyroidism symptom score and iii) SH {{does not seem to be}} associated with dyslipidemia...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} plasma total homocysteine (Hcys) and serum fibrinogen concentrations <b>in</b> subclinical hypothyroid (<b>SH)</b> and overt hypothyroid patients before and after L-thyroxine (LT 4) replacement and to compare them in euthyroid subjects. Fifteen SH and 20 hypothyroid premenopausal women were recruited in the study. We measured fasting plasma levels of Hcys and serum levels of free thyroxine (fT 4), free triiodothyronine (fT 3), thyrotropin (TSH), folate, vitamin B 12, fibrinogen, renal functions, and lipid profiles <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with <b>SH</b> and overt hypothyroid patients before and after LT 4 treatment. Eleven healthy women were included in the study as a control group. Pretreatment Hcys levels were similar <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> and control subjects, whereas mean fibrinogen level of <b>SH</b> <b>patients</b> was higher than that of control subjects (p< 0. 05). Baseline Hcys (p< 0. 01) and fibrinogen (p< 0. 001) levels of the overt hypothyroid patients were significantly higher than those of the healthy subjects, and the pretreatment Hcys levels decreased with LT 4 treatment (p< 0. 001). In conclusion, our data support that SH is not associated with hyperhomocysteinemia and Hcys does not appear to contribute to the increased risk for atherosclerotic disease <b>in</b> <b>patients</b> with <b>SH...</b>|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} reported that subarachnoid hemorrhage due to ruptured intracranial aneurysm (SH) {{is associated with}} changes in the hormonal profile in the first 24 hours after the event. We proposed that the hormonal changes observed are due to the intense stress to which the patients are exposed. However, the thyroidal hormonal profile {{is indicative of the}} presence of a nonthyroidal illness syndrome (NTIS). In this paper, we examined whether the change in the thyroid hormone profile is compatible with a NTIS. Two groups of patients were included in the study: A) 30 <b>patients</b> with <b>SH</b> (21 females and 9 males; 41. 7 ± 11. 4 years) and B) a control group including 25 patients with benign diseases of the spine (BDS) (lumbar disc hernia or stable spinal trauma) (8 females and 17 males; 41. 3 ± 14. 2 years). In a subgroup of eight patients of each group serum triiodothyronine (T 3) and reverse T 3 levels were measured. The blood samples were obtained between 8 : 00 and 9 : 00 AM. The following results were obtained: The SH group had smaller serum T 3 and free T 4 levels than the BDS group (p< 0. 05) : T 3 (ng/mL) : SH = 58. 7 ± 1. 1 and BDS = 74. 5 ± 13. 9; free T 4 (ng/dL) : SH = 0. 9 ± 0. 2 and BDS = 1. 1 ± 0. 3. There {{was no significant difference in}} the serum levels of total thyroxine (T 4) and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) between the two groups: T 4 (µg/dL) : SH = 6. 9 ± 1. 1 and BDS = 7. 4 ± 2. 1; TSH (µUI/mL) : SH = 1. 5 ± 0. 8 and BDS = 1. 8 ± 1, 0. In the sample of eight patients of each group we had the following results: T 3 (ng/mL) : SH = 66. 8 ± 3. 8 and BDS = 77. 2 ± 1. 1 (p < 0. 05); reverse T 3 (ng/dL) : SH = 32. 8 ± 8 and BDS = 24. 7 ± 2. 2 (NS); T 3 / reverse T 3 ratio: SH = 2. 6 ± 0. 3 and BDS = 3. 3 ± 0. 4 (NS). Thyreoglobulin and microsomal antibodies were not detectable, except in one <b>patient</b> <b>in</b> the <b>SH</b> group. <b>In</b> conclusion, the <b>SH</b> <b>patients</b> present serum levels of T 3 and free T 4 significantly lower than that of BDS patients; the thyroidal hormone profile suggests that <b>SH</b> <b>patients</b> have developed the nonthyroidal illness syndrome...|$|R

RESULTSdOver a 1 -year follow-up period, the median rates of SH were reduced from 4. 0 (interquartile range [IQR] 0. 75 – 7. 25) episodes/patient-year to 0. 0 (0. 0 – 1. 25) episodes/patient-year (P, 0. 001), and the mean (6 SD) rates were reduced from 8. 16 13 to 0. 66 1. 2 episodes/ year (P = 0. 005). HbA 1 c was reduced from 8. 16 1. 2 % to 7. 66 1. 0 % over the year (P = 0. 005). The mean Gold score, measured in 19 patients, did not change: 5. 1 6 1. 5 vs. 5. 2 6 1. 9 (P = 0. 67).

40|$|Background: A {{controversy}} exists {{regarding the}} association between subclinical hypothyroidism (SH) and dyslipidemia. Moreover, studies on lipid ratios and atherogenic index of plasma (AIP) <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> are rare, particularly in the Indian scenario. Aim: This study aimed to investigate abnormalities in conventional lipid profile, lipid ratios, and AIP <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> and attempted to correlate thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH) and AIP <b>in</b> <b>SH.</b> Materials and Methods: In this retrospective analysis of <b>patient</b> records of <b>SH</b> subjects and euthyroid subjects, age, free triiodothyronine, free thyroxine, TSH, total cholesterol, triglycerides, high-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (HDL-C), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol, lipid ratios, and AIP were compared between the two groups. The correlation of TSH and AIP <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> was studied. Spearman′s correlation, Mann-Whitney U-test and logistic regression analysis were performed. Results: Triglyceride, triglyceride/HDL-C, and AIP were significantly higher <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> as compared to euthyroid group, {{but there was no}} correlation between TSH and AIP <b>in</b> <b>SH.</b> AIP emerged as the significant single factor associated with <b>SH</b> <b>in</b> multiple logistic regressions. Conclusion: The positive association of dyslipidemia and SH indicates a need for regular screening of these patients to enable early diagnosis and treatment of dyslipidemia.

40|$|A {{decrease}} in plasma Ca 2 + {{and increases in}} plasma immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (PTH) have been reported <b>in</b> spontaneously hypertensive (<b>SH)</b> rats as compared with normotensive Wistar-Kyoto (WKy) rats. These changes should lead to a higher plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D (1, 25 -dihydroxycholecalciferol/ 1, 25 -dihydroxyergocalciferol) concentration <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> rat if the kidney responds appropriately. Plasma 1, 25 (OH) 2 D, however, {{has been reported to}} be normal <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> rats, suggesting possible impairments of vitamin D metabolism in this animal model of hypertension. To test this possibility, we studied the effect of PTH on renal production of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> rats before (4 weeks of age) and after (12 weeks of age) the onset of hypertension. Basal serum levels of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D were normal <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> rats at both ages. At 4 weeks of age, the rise in serum 1, 25 (OH) 2 D after PTH injection (50 units subcutaneously every 2 h; four times) was also normal <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> rats. By contrast, at 12 weeks of age, the rise in serum 1, 25 (OH) 2 D was approximately one-half of that in WKy rats, despite the similar rises in serum Ca 2 + levels in both groups by PTH injection. The attenuated rise in serum 1, 25 (OH) 2 D <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> rats was consistent with the impaired response of renal 1 -hydroxylase (25 -hydroxycholecalciferol 1 alpha-hydroxylase) activity to PTH. Basal 1, 25 (OH) 2 D production by the kidney <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> rat was higher than that in WKy rats both at 4 and 12 weeks of age. These data suggest that, <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> rats: serum 1, 25 (OH) 2 D is inappropriately low in relation to the elevated PTH and this may be due, at least in part, to the impaired responsiveness to PTH of renal 1 -hydroxylase and to the enhanced metabolism of 1, 25 (OH) 2 D, and elevated PTH or other agents may stimulate the 1 -hydroxylase in the kidney even before the onset of hypertension...|$|R

In KA rats, these delta and alpha/beta 1 effects were observed 2 weeks post-kainate, while the beta 2 activity increase occurred after 5 weeks in the hippocampus and, to a greater extent, 9 weeks post-injection in both brain areas. <b>In</b> <b>SH</b> rats, NMDA increased delta and decreased alpha/beta 1 activity, similar to KA rats 5 weeks post-injection. <b>In</b> <b>SH</b> rats, clonidine augmented theta/beta 2 increase in the cortex and alpha suppression in both brain areas, in parallel with induction of beta 2 activity in the hippocampus. These beta 2 effects were observed 5 and 9 weeks post-kainate. <b>In</b> <b>SH</b> rats, baclofen produced robust delta/theta enhancement and alpha/beta 1 suppression in both brain areas, with additional beta 2 activity increase in the hippocampus, while muscimol was ineffective in both groups of rats.

40|$|Sympathetic nerve {{activity}} (SNA) is elevated in established hypertension. We {{tested the}} hypothesis that SNA is elevated in neonate and juvenile spontaneously hypertensive (SH) rats prior {{to the development of}} hypertension, and that {{this may be due to}} augmented respiratory–sympathetic coupling. Using the working heart–brainstem preparation, perfusion pressure, phrenic nerve activity and thoracic (T 8) SNA were recorded <b>in</b> male <b>SH</b> rats and normotensive Wistar–Kyoto (WKY) rats at three ages: neonates (postnatal day 9 – 16), 3 weeks old and 5 weeks old. Perfusion pressure was higher <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> rats at all ages reflecting higher vascular resistance. The amplitude of respiratory-related bursts of SNA was greater <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> rats at all ages (P < 0. 05). This was reflected in larger Traube–Hering pressure waves <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> rats (1. 4 ± 0. 8 versus 9. 8 ± 1. 5 mmHg WKY versus SH rat, 5 weeks old, n= 5 per group, P < 0. 01). Recovery from hypocapnic-induced apnoea and reinstatement of Traube–Hering waves produced a significantly greater increase in perfusion pressure <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> rats (P < 0. 05). Differences in respiratory–sympathetic coupling <b>in</b> the <b>SH</b> rat were not secondary to changes in central or peripheral chemoreflex sensitivity, nor were they related to altered arterial baroreflex function. We have shown that increased SNA is already present <b>in</b> <b>SH</b> rats <b>in</b> early postnatal life as revealed by augmented respiratory modulation of SNA. This is reflected in an increased magnitude of Traube–Hering waves resulting in elevated perfusion pressure <b>in</b> the <b>SH</b> rat.

40|$|Objective. The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{evaluate}} the oxidative stress biomarkers in patients with subclinical hypothyroidism (n= 20) and health controls (n= 20). Subjects and Methods. Total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TGs), low-density lipoprotein-cholesterol (LDL-C), high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), thiobarbituric acid reactive substances (TBARSs), catalase (CAT), superoxide dismutase (SOD), and arylesterase (ARE) were analyzed. Results. TC, LDL-C, TBARS, and CAT were higher in subclinical hypothyroidism patients, whereas SOD did not change. Arylesterase activity was significantly lower <b>in</b> the <b>SH</b> group, compared with the control group. Correlation analyses revealed the association of lipids (TC and LDL-C) with both oxidative stress biomarkers and thyrotropin (TSH). Thyroid hormones were correlated only with triglyceride levels. In addition, TSH was significantly correlated with TBARS, CAT, and SOD. However, no significant correlations were observed after controlling TC levels. Conclusions. We found that <b>SH</b> <b>patients</b> are under increased oxidative stress manifested by reduced ARE activity and elevated lipoperoxidation and CAT activity.
