5|$|Acetyl-CoA, on {{the other}} hand, derived from {{pyruvate}} oxidation, or from the beta-oxidation of fatty acids, is the only <b>fuel</b> <b>to</b> enter the citric acid cycle. With each turn of the cycle one molecule of acetyl-CoA is consumed for every molecule of oxaloacetate present in the mitochondrial matrix, and is never regenerated. It is the oxidation of the acetate portion of acetyl-CoA that produces CO2 and water, with the energy thus released captured {{in the form of}} ATP.|$|E
5|$|Although many fires {{likewise}} burnt {{following the}} bombing, {{in contrast to}} Hiroshima where sufficient fuel density was available, no firestorm developed in Nagasaki as the damaged areas did not furnish enough <b>fuel</b> <b>to</b> generate the phenomenon. Instead, the ambient wind at the time pushed the fire spread along the valley.|$|E

5|$|Because {{there is}} a {{parallel}} line, the Hoved Line running {{all the way from}} Oslo S to Eidsvoll, some trains can choose to use this line instead. This is primarily done by some commuter trains, as well as all freight trains. The only exception to this are trains hauling jet <b>fuel</b> <b>to</b> the airport, who have to use the Gardermoen Line from Kløfta. This service is provided by CargoNet.|$|E
5|$|By 1943, the Allies enjoyed air {{supremacy}} in North Africa. The Ju 87s ventured out in Rotte strength only, often jettisoning their bombs {{at the first}} sight of enemy aircraft. Adding to this trouble, the German fighters had only enough <b>fuel</b> <b>to</b> cover the Ju 87s on take off, their most vulnerable point. After that, the Stukas were on their own.|$|E
5|$|Coal mining {{became a}} major industry, and {{continued}} to grow into the 20th century, producing the <b>fuel</b> <b>to</b> heat homes, factories and drive steam engines, locomotives and steamships. By 1914 there were 1,000,000 coal miners in Scotland. The stereotype emerged early on of Scottish colliers as brutish, non-religious and socially isolated serfs; that was an exaggeration, for their life style resembled coal miners everywhere, with {{a strong emphasis on}} masculinity, egalitarianism, group solidarity, and support for radical labour movements.|$|E

Trees were used to furnish <b>fuel</b> <b>to</b> heat homes, tannin for the many tanneries that were spread throughout the state, and wood for construction, furniture, and barrel making. Large areas of forest were harvested by colliers to fire iron furnaces. Rifle stocks and shingles were made from Pennsylvania timber, as were a wide variety of household utensils, and the first Conestoga wagons.|$|E
5|$|MOX fuel {{has been}} in use since the 1980s, and is widely used in Europe. In September 2000, the United States and the Russian Federation signed a Plutonium Management and Disposition Agreement by which each agreed to dispose of 34tonnes of weapons-grade {{plutonium}}. The U.S. Department of Energy plans to dispose of 34tonnes of weapons-grade plutonium in the United States {{before the end of}} 2019 by converting the plutonium to a MOX <b>fuel</b> <b>to</b> be used in commercial nuclear power reactors.|$|E

5|$|A {{participant}} in the U.S. Air Force's Man in Space Soonest and X-20 Dyna-Soar human spaceflight programs, Armstrong joined the NASA Astronaut Corps in 1962. He made his first space flight as command pilot of Gemini 8 in March 1966, becoming NASA's first civilian astronaut to fly in space. He performed the first docking of two spacecraft, with pilot David Scott. This mission was aborted after Armstrong used some of his reentry control <b>fuel</b> <b>to</b> prevent a dangerous spin caused by a stuck thruster, in the first in-flight space emergency.|$|E
5|$|After {{three runs}} over the city, and with fuel running low {{because of the}} failed fuel pump, they headed for their {{secondary}} target, Nagasaki. Fuel consumption calculations made en route indicated that Bockscar had insufficient <b>fuel</b> <b>to</b> reach Iwo Jima and {{would be forced to}} divert to Okinawa, which had become entirely Allied-occupied territory only six weeks earlier. After initially deciding that if Nagasaki were obscured on their arrival the crew would carry the bomb to Okinawa and dispose of it in the ocean if necessary, Ashworth ruled that a radar approach would be used if the target was obscured.|$|E
5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old distribution system with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the <b>fuel</b> <b>to</b> local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.|$|E
