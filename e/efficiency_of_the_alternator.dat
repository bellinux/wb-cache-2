40|$|Automobiles depend {{more and}} more on {{electric}} power. Analysis of warranty data by automotive OEMs shows that faults in the automotive electrical power generation and storage (EPGS) system are often misdiagnosed. Therefore, monitoring of the state of health (SOH) of the automotive EPGS system is vital for early and correct diagnosis of faults in it, ensuring a reliable supply of electric power to the vehicle and reducing maintenance costs. In this research project, a model-based SOH monitoring method for the EPGS system is developed without the requirement of an alternator current sensor. A model representing the dynamic relationship between the battery current and the alternator filed duty voltage cycle is presented. An important model parameter that characterizes the current generation <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternator</b> system is adaptively estimated by using a recursive least square algorithm. Based on fault modes and effect analysis, a model-based fault detection and isolation decision scheme is developed for the EPGS system faults under consideration. The SOH monitoring method has been implemented using an EPGS system experimental test bench at GM R and D Center. Real-time evaluation results have shown its effectiveness and robustness...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper studies an ATEG {{system which}} {{works on the}} {{temperature}} difference between the exhaust gases (hot side) and circulating engine coolant liquid (cold side) of an Internal Combustion (IC) engine. The approach taken in this paper is theoretical analysis by understanding the basic physics (mathematical equations) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ATEG system. These mathematical equations are modeled in MATLAB/Simulink environment for computer simulation. The inputs to this model, for simulation, are given from the IC engine test bench data. The {{results indicate that the}} ATEG system is suitable to drive all the electrical loads in a small (< 1. 4 liter engine) and midsized (between 1. 4 liter and 2 liter engine) IC engine driven Automobiles. Therefore, ATEG system forms a great candidate to replace <b>the</b> <b>alternator</b> for small and midsized Automobiles. Replacing <b>the</b> <b>alternator</b> by <b>the</b> ATEG eliminates <b>the</b> load <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternator</b> on <b>the</b> IC engine and increases <b>the</b> overall fuel <b>efficiency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> automobile greatly (about 4 - 7 % depending on the IC engine and electrical demand <b>of</b> <b>the</b> car) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{high speed}} {{permanent}} magnet alternator with a power rating of 4. 5 kW at 30, 000 rpm rated speed is indigenously developed for Gas Turbine Research Establishment (GTRE). An integrated test rig is designed and fabricated to demonstrate <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternator.</b> <b>The</b> mechanical design <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternator</b> and <b>the</b> integrated test rig is presented in this report. <b>The</b> <b>alternator</b> mainly consisted <b>of</b> a rotor and a stator. The rotor is constructed with a cylindrical iron core, several magnets arranged circumferentially over the core and sleeve containment over the magnets in a concentric manner. The containment sleeve is the most critical component in the rotor assembly as it experiences very high circumferential stress resulting from <b>the</b> centrifugal loads <b>of</b> <b>the</b> magnets and its inertia due to high speed of rotation. A high degree of interference is required in the rotor assembly between the core, magnets and the sleeve {{in order to avoid}} slippage at high speed. A novel concept introduced relaxes the interference requirement and makes the assembly easier. Finite element analysis is carried out for the rotor by simulating interference and contacts between rotor core, magnet and the sleeve. The rotor shaft is supported at its ends using angular contact ball bearings with preloading spring. Critical speed analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> rotor is carried out and the first critical speed is well above the design speed. <b>The</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternator</b> with an output of 4. 5 kW power at 30000 rpm was successfully demonstrated...|$|R

40|$|An iron {{structure}} {{was developed to}} support a mountain bicycle, a car alternator and six halogen light bulbs. It keeps <b>the</b> rear wheel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> bicycle suspended, so that the user can pedal without moving forward. On the rear wheel, a medium-sized cogwheel fixed on the rear wheel is linked to <b>the</b> <b>alternator</b> by a chain (Fig. 3). <b>The</b> cogwheel <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternator</b> has a smaller diameter. This difference in cogwheels diameters is essential to achieve high rotation speeds <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>alternator</b> rotor. <b>The</b> <b>alternator</b> used in this project had a damaged voltage regulator. So, a 12 V battery was permanently connected to the rotor. This way, the rotor generates a constant magnetic field. When the rotor starts to turn, it induces a three-phase alternating current system in <b>the</b> coils <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stator. These currents are then rectified and the resulting direct current is used to power the halogen light bulbs. The generated magnetic field opposes to the movement, offering a resistance that depends on <b>the</b> number <b>of</b> lamps used. <b>The</b> higher the current consumed by the lamps, the higher the effort by the user.
