40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{demonstrate}} that the decision facilitation and decision influencing roles for management information are concomitant in organizations, and therefore must be analysed concurrently. Design/methodology/approach – A two-stage regression procedure for testing the moderating and intervening relationships among the variables of interest was adopted. First, the interaction of <b>individual</b> <b>level</b> <b>controls</b> (administrative and professional) on broad scope management accounting system (MAS) was tested, then the intervening relationship between broad scope MAS, job-relevant information (JRI), and performance was analysed. Findings – Tests of the moderating relationship between the control environment, broad scope MAS, JRI, and performance revealed a significant interaction term for JRI, but not for performance. Research limitations/implications – The usual measurement and implementation errors associated with survey methodology attach to this study. Furthermore, the sample was not randomly selected, which undermines the external validity of the findings. External validity will be further compromised by the relatively small sample size. Hence, caution is recommended in generalising the results to a wider population. Practical implications – The study provides evidence on the relationship between broad scope MAS, <b>individual</b> <b>level</b> <b>control</b> mechanisms and the outcome variable of JRI. Originality/value – The paper seeks to use a controlled setting, established measures, and methods of analysis to suggest that when existing theory explains the empirical relationship among the variables of interest in more than one way, it may be necessary to comprehensively examine the relationships theoretically and empirically at more than one level to enable a better explanation of the linkage between theory and the empirical tests.

METHODS: We studied 60 FM, 60 RA patients and 60 controls for fall frequency in one week, one month, six months and one year. Patients were submitted to body mass index determination and balance evaluation through the Berg scale. Data on disease impact and depression were collected in FM patients through the Fibromyalgia Impact Questionnaire (FIQ) and the Beck Questionnaire. RESULTS: FM patients had a higher frequency of falls than RA patients and <b>control</b> <b>individuals</b> in one month (p< 0. 0001), in six months (p< 0. 0001) and in one year (p< 0. 0001).

Methods: Concentrations of Hcy, vitamin B 12 and folate were measured in 33 PD patients and 41 normal <b>control</b> <b>individuals.</b> Mini-mental Status Examination (MMSE) was assessed in all subjects. In PD patients, Hoehn & Yahr stage and Unified Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) motor scores were also examined.

40|$|Changes in oxygen levels, {{due to the}} {{environment}} or disease initiates a plethora of acute and chronic responses in the body to enable optimal physiological adaptation to overcome impaired oxygen delivery. Homeostatic regulation mechanisms in the cardiovascular and respiratory systems rapidly act to maintain oxygen supply to sustain normal metabolism; prolonged exposure to a low oxygen tension initiates changes in gene expression. In control {{of many of these}} responses is a transcription factor (hypoxia-inducible factor, HIF). Among other responses it induces changes in erythropoiesis, glycolysis and angiogenesis. This study primarily aimed to elucidate the conditions of hypoxia, local or systemic, which would initiate capillary growth in different tissues, and determine whether manipulation of the pathway (by HIF stabilisation) would enhance this response. A systemic response to hypoxia led to increased capillarity in the heart and diaphragm, and in both the local and systemic models changes in vascularity varied with degree of hypoxia, though manipulation of the HIF pathway had no effect. HIF upregulation under conditions of normoxia with muscle overload, also failed to show effects of manipulation of the HIF pathway. Therefore, ablation of <b>individual</b> enzymes <b>controlling</b> <b>levels</b> of HIF was utilised. A number of genes associated with angiogenesis and protein remodelling were upregulated, as seen with gene arrays, though histological evidence for the former was poor, suggesting a delay in gene expression and translation into downstream effects. We examined whether changes in plasma EPO expression were predictive of sickness upon ascent to altitude, and whether leukocytes {{could be used as a}} circulating indicator of HIF-mediated gene expression. EPO was enhanced in all subjects following exposure to hypoxia, and it may be one marker for AMS, but individual variation in gene responses to hypoxia suggests leukocytes may not be a viable indicator of the circulating systemic response to hypoxia. This study emphasises the complexity of the HIF pathway, highlighting the multitude of its effects both on a molecular and physiological level.

Furthermore, we find evidence for reverse effects with both perceived mental and physical health appearing to be the dominant causal factor with respect to the prospective level of social network.
