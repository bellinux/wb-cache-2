25|$|The Estonian {{literary}} tradition started by Kreutzwald continued with Koidula but whereas The Bard of Viru tried {{to imitate the}} regivärss folk traditions of ancient Estonian, Koidula wrote (mostly) in modern, Western European end-rhyming metres that had, by the mid 19th century, become the dominant form. This made Koidula's poetry much more accessible to the popular reader. But the major importance of Koidula lays {{not so much in}} her preferred form of verse but in her potent use of the Estonian language. Estonian was, still, in the 1860s, in a German dominated Baltic province of Imperial Russia, the language of the oppressed indigenous peasantry. It was still the subject of orthographical bickering, still used in the main for predominantly patronising educationalist or religious texts, practical advice to farmers or cheap and cheerful popular story telling. Koidula successfully used the vernacular language to express emotions that ranged from an affectionate poem about the family cat, in Meie kass (Our Cat) and delicate love poetry, Head ööd (<b>Good</b> <b>Night)</b> <b>to</b> a powerful cri de coeur and rallying call to an oppressed nation, Mu isamaa nad olid matnud (My Country, they have buried you). With Lydia Koidula, the colonial view that the Estonian language was an underdeveloped instrument for communication was, for the first time, demonstrably contradicted.|$|E
2500|$|The Aviators {{opened their}} {{season with a}} four-game series against the Orange County Breakers, who were {{returning}} to Southern California after playing the previous two seasons as the Austin Aces. When the Breakers last called Orange County their home in 2013, the Aviators had not yet moved to California and were known as the New York Sportimes. While the teams {{did not have any}} history as geographic rivals, the franchises did meet in the 2005 WTT Finals with the Sportimes earning the title with a 21–18 victory over the Newport Beach Breakers. The two franchises also boasted the best regular-season records in WTT over the past two seasons with the Aviators achieving the feat in 2014, and the Aces doing so in 2015. The Aviators and Breakers split the series with each team winning both of its home matches. The four matches in four nights quickly developed the feel of a rivalry. [...] "It definitely starts to get a little personal," [...] said the Breakers' Nicole Gibbs. [...] "Things got a little feisty tonight, so it was a <b>good</b> <b>night</b> <b>to</b> bring the cameras. We were getting in each other's faces, and there were some big 'Come ons'.
