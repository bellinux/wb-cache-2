5000|$|However, the act {{of cycling}} the action on such a firearm (as a natural {{consequence}} of discharging the firearm, or to chamber the first round) will leave the hammer cocked in single-action mode. To return the pistol to its safe state, {{it is necessary to}} uncock (decock) the hammer, usually by holding the hammer spur, carefully pulling the trigger, and then slowly lowering the hammer on the firing pin. However hammer fired semi-auto pistols have a beaver tail to protect the shooters hand from the slide which makes it more difficult (as opposed to a double action/single action revolver) to securely and firmly grasp the hammer with the thumb thus making an accidental discharge more likely. Striker-fired pistols on the other hand do not have a hammer so the only way to return the trigger to its longer pull (safer) state is by means of a decocking or rather detensioning lever which actually releases the tension in the striker's spring without allowing firing pin <b>full</b> <b>travel</b> and internal safeties disengagement (such as firing pin block which these types of firearms are generally fitted with). Note that when a handgun is fitted with a so-called decocking lever {{there is no need to}} pull the trigger while holding the lever like in a revolver, the actual process of [...] "decocking" [...] the gun is done by simply flipping the decocking lever to its [...] "decocked" [...] position with the fingers away from the trigger.|$|E
5000|$|In 1983, {{seeking to}} respond to the {{humanitarian}} crisis in Central America and to U.S. policies that backed armies that slaughtered civilians, U.S. churches, grassroots and policy groups sought a coordinated way to respond. Working out of borrowed office space, with one or two paid staff, the Central America Working Group, as it was then called, served to organize, educate, and inspire activists advocating peace and justice in Central America. CAWG developed allies in Congress, the media and the public to end military assistance to the Salvadoran and Guatemalan governments and the Nicaraguan Contras. After the wars ended, CAWG coordinated efforts to encourage implementation of historic peace agreements and support the search for truth by helping to spur the declassification of thousands of U.S. documents for Central American truth commissions.In the early 1990s, the groups participating in CAWG coalition decided, rather than to disband, to expand their issues, becoming the Latin America Working Group. The LAWG has worked since then to call for disaster relief and development aid to the region, successfully lift the embargo on the sale of food and medicine to Cuba, lift the restrictions on Cuban-American travel and advocate {{for an end to the}} <b>full</b> <b>travel</b> ban, [...] cut military aid and increase humanitarian aid to Colombia, support the struggle for fair elections in Mexico, and advocate for just border policies that recognize the human rights of migrants and border communities.
