50|$|Digital {{switching}} systems and some transmission systems (e.g., SONET) depend on reliable, high-quality synchronization (or timing) to prevent impairments. To provide this, most service providers utilize interoffice synchronization distribution networks {{based on the}} stratum hierarchy and implement the BITS concept to meet <b>intraoffice</b> synchronization needs.|$|E
50|$|Stored-program analog {{switches}} {{such as the}} 1ESS switch, {{had both}} simple wire junctors and circuit junctors. Circuit junctors were {{in the form of}} plug-in circuit boards to provide talk battery and supervision for <b>intraoffice</b> calls and were closely similar to <b>intraoffice</b> trunk packs, with two scan points and two signal distributor points per circuit, two circuits per plug-in pack. Wire junctors were two-wire connections between trunk nets and other trunk nets or line nets. When three-way calling was introduced, three-port conference trunks were used, which only appeared on trunk nets. All junctors appeared in subgroups of sixteen on plugs or jacks at the Junctor Grouping Frame, where as many subgroups as required were plugged into other trunk nets, line nets, or circuit junctor frames.|$|E

"No Trout About It" [...] (7.14) Shawn and Juliet make a romantically goofy {{phone call}} as {{revealed}} by Shawn when re-telling {{a case to}} a police consultant, much to Juliet's embarrassment. She later voices her concerns about her position at the department due to <b>intraoffice</b> dating with Shawn which is usually against police regulations.|$|E
5000|$|Mormon {{scholar and}} {{columnist}} Jana Riess {{was critical of}} the organization's tactics, stating: [...] "I am very concerned about privacy in our culture more generally. People in the workplace {{have the right to}} expect that <b>intraoffice</b> communication and their emails will stay private." [...] She called MormonLeaks [...] "disturbing" [...] and said: [...] "It is not good news for any of us." [...] On a positive note, Riess said it could motivate the upper LDS Church leadership to increase its transparency.|$|E
50|$|Junctor Circuits were {{installed}} in similar frames, but were simpler, {{with only two}} relays. They were used only in Line to Line junctors. Large offices, {{in addition to these}} Junctor Circuits, had <b>Intraoffice</b> Trunks, which were of similar design but fit into the same Universal Trunk Frames as interoffice trunks. They carried overflow traffic when the small Junctor Groups of an office with many LN could not cope. Digit transmitters, receivers, other complex service circuits, and some complex trunks including those using E&M signaling, were permanently mounted in relay racks similar to those of 5XB rather than plug-in frames.|$|E

Building on prior studies, it views social network topology along structural, relational and cognitive dimensions. Where previous research used a self-reporting questionnaire to gauge these dimensions, this research uses Social Network Analysis (SNA) software to measure e-mail communication logs between group members. The {{study was conducted in}} a national travel agency and focused on the social networks of 187 offices, each a subsidiary of the national travel agency. Each office group was tasked similarly and represented a unit of analysis. An analysis of more than 7 million emails was undertaken to generate social network measures for the firm wide network. Subgraphs representing the <b>intraoffice</b> social networks were then generated for each of the 187 travel offices in the greater firm-wide network. NodeXL® software was used to generate group measures representing the dimensions of each office’s social network topology. As in prior studies, Centrality, Structural Holes, and Tie Strength (all social network concepts) were used to measure and compare the dimensions of the intragroup social networks. This study contributes by helping to differentiate the concepts of social capital and social network. This research finds the use of email logs to generate SNA more efficient but as effective as prior survey techniques. The study also extends prior work by dynamically examining the tie formation amongst recently hired employees. The study confirms existing views of a curvilinear relationship between social network relations and firm performance. This study finds social network topology a valuable predictor of group performance...|$|E
