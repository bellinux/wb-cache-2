6000|$|... "I should hardly {{think that}} would be the case if they watch you as {{strictly}} as you believe.

6000|$|... 'From General Duroc's manner. In these cursed Courts, if the Emperor smiles {{upon you}} {{everyone}} smiles, {{down to that}} flunkey in the red velvet coat yonder. But if the Emperor frowns, why, you have only {{to look at the}} face of the man who washes the Imperial plates, and you will see the frown reflected upon it. And the worst of it is that, if you are a plain-witted man, <b>you</b> may never <b>find</b> <b>out</b> <b>what</b> earned <b>you</b> either the frown or the smile. That is why I had rather wear the shoulder-straps of a lieutenant, and be at the side of my squadron, with a good horse between my knees and my sabre clanking against my stirrup-iron, than have Monsieur Talleyrand's grand hotel in the Rue Saint Florentin, and his hundred thousand livres of income.' ...|$|R

When he had proceeded on his way downstairs, Fanny's distrust of him insisted on expressing itself.

He will give it to you when he finds an opportunity, and he wishes you to give him an answer, making any {{suggestion}} that may occur to you as to the best way of his setting about it. He says that he shall make acquaintances among the negroes North, and will find someone who will read your note to him and write you an answer. I have told him that if he is caught at the game he is likely to be inside a prison a bit longer than you are, even if worse doesn't befall him. However, he makes light of this, and is bent upon carrying out his plans, and I can only hope he will succeed.|$|R
