40|$|Mutual funds {{underwent}} some {{rapid development}} during 2008 - 2011, this was {{indicated by the}} escalation {{of a number of}} NAB and its inclusion units value. However, mutual funds still experience efficiency inconsistency on their operating activities. This research’s purpose is to analyse the efficiency level on each mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> to compare efficiency between stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds,</b> stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds,</b> stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds.</b> There are eighty-nine mutual funds used as samples done by purposive sampling on this research; twenty-nine stock mutual funds, twenty-nine fixed-income mutual funds, twenty-one mixed mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> nine protected mutual funds. This research used Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) method. A Unit Kegiatan Ekonomi (UKE) is considered efficient if the efficiency value reachs perfection (100 percent), on the contrary when the efficiency value is less than 100 percent, then the UKE is rated as inefficient. The variables on this research are chosen based on intermediation approach. The input variables are standard deviation of return, investation processing services cost ratio, custodian services cost ratio, other fees cost ratio, and redemption cost; and the output variables are average return and assets growth toward return. To find out the efficiency value difference on each mutual funds, the research used Mann Whitney U test. The result of analysis using DEA method indicated that fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 2011 incline to have efficiency increase even though it’s fluctuating with the average of 84. 03 percent in fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> 81. 04 percent in mixed mutual funds. Mann Whitney U hypothesis testing shows that there is no efficiency difference between stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds,</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 2011; but there is an efficiency difference between stock mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> protected mutual <b>funds,</b> <b>and</b> fixed-income mutual <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> mixed mutual <b>funds</b> during 2008 - 201...|$|R
