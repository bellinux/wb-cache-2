25|$|The lifetime, service life, load life or {{useful life}} of {{electrolytic}} capacitors {{is a special}} characteristic of non-solid aluminum electrolytic capacitors, whose liquid electrolyte can evaporate over time. Lowering the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>level</b> influences the electrical parameters of the capacitors. The capacitance decreases and the impedance and ESR increase with decreasing amounts of electrolyte. This very slow electrolyte drying-out depends on the temperature, the applied ripple current load, and the applied voltage. The lower these parameters compared with their maximum values the longer the capacitor's “life”. The “end of life” point {{is defined by the}} appearance of wear-out failures or degradation failures when either capacitance, impedance, ESR or leakage current exceed their specified change limits.|$|E

40|$|SummaryWe {{studied the}} effects of high doses of {{pentobarbital}} (PB) and carbamazepine (CBZ) on <b>electrolyte</b> <b>levels</b> and pH in an epileptic animal model. Pentobarbital decreased Ca 2 + and Na+ levels without pentylenetetrazole (PTZ). After this, Ca 2 + and Na+ levels continued to decrease except when CBZ was used, which preserved the Ca 2 + levels PTZ may have opposed effects on PB.

50|$|Over{{charging}} {{with high}} charging voltages generates oxygen and hydrogen gas by electrolysis of water, which is {{lost to the}} cell. The design of some types of lead-acid battery allow the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>level</b> to be inspected and topped up with any water that has been lost.|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "flooded" [...] is {{used because}} {{this type of}} battery {{contains}} a quantity of electrolyte fluid so that the plates are completely submerged. The <b>electrolyte</b> <b>level</b> should be above the tops of plates {{which serves as a}} reservoir to make sure that water loss during charging does not lower the level below the plate tops and cause damage. Flooded batteries will decompose some water from the electrolyte during charging, so regular maintenance of flooded batteries requires inspection of <b>electrolyte</b> <b>level</b> and addition of water. Major modes of failure of deep-cycle batteries are loss of the active material due to shedding of the plates, and corrosion of the internal grid that supports active material. The capacity of a deep cycle battery is usually limited by electrolyte capacity and not by the plate mass, to improve life expectancy.|$|E
50|$|Treatments for Glycerol Kinase Deficiency are {{targeted}} {{to treat the}} symptoms {{because there are no}} permanent treatments for this disease. The main way to treat these symptoms is by using corticosteroids, glucose infusion, or mineralocorticoids. Corticosteroids are steroid hormones that are naturally produced in the adrenal glands. These hormones regulate stress responses, carbohydrate metabolism, blood <b>electrolyte</b> <b>levels,</b> as well as other uses. The mineralocorticoids, such as aldosterone control many <b>electrolyte</b> <b>levels</b> and allow the kidneys to retain sodium. Glucose infusion is coupled with insulin infusion to monitor blood glucose levels and keep them stable.|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{were carried}} out to {{investigate}} influences of steroid hormones on the serum <b>electrolytes</b> <b>level</b> of the rats. Sex difference and comparison between nephrectomized and non-nephrectomized rats were particularly studied. 1) Administration of testosterone propionate resulted in hyperpotassemia in nephrectomized rats of both sex, but more markedly of male rats. No serum electrolytes change was observed in non-nephrectomized rats. 2) Administration of estradiol benzoate caused no change of serum <b>electrolytes</b> <b>level</b> in male rats but caused hyponatremia, hypochloremia and alkalosis in female rats. This effect was somewhat emphasized in the nephrectomized group when 0. 04 mg of estrogen per 100 g body weight was administered. 3) Cortisone administration caused hyperpotassemia, hyperphosphatemia, hypochloremia and alkalosis in male rats, among which hyperpotassemia was quite striking in the nephrectomized group. In female rats, hyperpotassemia, hypochloremia and alkalosis were also observed, but hyperpotassemia was less marked than that seen in male rats.

50|$|A {{horse that}} is {{dehydrated}} has an elevated <b>electrolyte</b> <b>level</b> in its body, which should cause thirst. If a horse does not drink, giving electrolytes (by squirting a paste {{in the back}} of the horse's mouth) can further elevate the level, hence cause greater thirst, possibly inducing a reluctant horse to drink. However, giving electrolytes to a dehydrated horse can also further disturb the electrolyte balance, resulting in serious medical problems such as thumps, muscle spasms, and tying up.|$|E
50|$|Flooded {{lead-acid}} {{batteries are}} the cheapest and in past most common traction batteries available. There {{are two main}} types of lead-acid batteries: automobile engine starter batteries, and deep cycle batteries. Automobile alternators are designed to provide starter batteries high charge rates for fast charges, while deep cycle batteries used for electric vehicles like forklifts or golf carts, and as the auxiliary house batteries in RV's, require different multi-stage charging. No lead acid battery should be discharged below 50% of its capacity, as it shortens the battery's life. Flooded batteries require inspection of <b>electrolyte</b> <b>level</b> and occasional replacement of water which gases away during the normal charging cycle.|$|E

5000|$|In a valve {{regulated}} {{lead acid battery}} (VRLA) the hydrogen and oxygen produced in the cells largely recombine into water. Leakage is minimal, although some electrolyte still escapes if the recombination cannot keep up with gas evolution. Since VRLA batteries do not require (and make impossible) regular checking of the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>level,</b> they have been called maintenance free batteries. However, this is somewhat of a misnomer. VRLA cells do require maintenance. As electrolyte is lost, VRLA cells [...] "dry-out" [...] and lose capacity. This can be detected by taking regular internal resistance, conductance or impedance measurements. Regular testing reveals whether more involved testing and maintenance is required. Recent maintenance procedures have been developed allowing [...] "rehydration", often restoring significant amounts of lost capacity.|$|E

50|$|Vented {{cell voltage}} rises rapidly {{at the end}} of charge {{allowing}} for very simple charger circuitry to be used. Typically a battery is constant current charged at 1 CA rate until all the cells have reached at least 1.55 V. Another charge cycle follows at 0.1 CA rate, again until all cells have reached 1.55 V. The charge is finished with an equalizing or top-up charge, typically for not less than 4 hours at 0.1 CA rate. The purpose of the over-charge is to expel as much (if not all) of the gases collected on the electrodes, hydrogen on the negative and oxygen on the positive, and some of these gases recombine to form water which in turn will raise the <b>electrolyte</b> <b>level</b> to its highest level after which it is safe to adjust the electrolyte levels. During the over-charge or top-up charge, the cell voltages will go beyond 1.6 V and then slowly start to drop. No cell should rise above 1.71 V (dry cell) or drop below 1.55 V (gas barrier broken).|$|E
