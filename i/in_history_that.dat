5|$|Adaptations of Gibson's fiction have {{frequently}} been optioned and proposed, to limited success. Two of the author's short stories, both {{set in the}} Sprawl trilogy universe, have been loosely adapted as films: Johnny Mnemonic (1995) with screenplay by Gibson and starring Keanu Reeves, Dolph Lundgren and Takeshi Kitano, and New Rose Hotel (1998), starring Christopher Walken, Willem Dafoe, and Asia Argento. The former {{was the first time}} <b>in</b> <b>history</b> <b>that</b> a book was launched simultaneously as a film and a CD-ROM interactive video game. , Vincenzo Natali still hoped to bring Neuromancer to the screen, after some years in development hell. Count Zero was at one point being developed as The Zen Differential with director Michael Mann attached, and the third novel in the Sprawl trilogy, Mona Lisa Overdrive, has also been optioned and bought. An anime adaptation of Idoru was announced as in development in 2006, and Pattern Recognition {{was in the process of}} development by director Peter Weir, although according to Gibson the latter is no longer attached to the project.

5|$|Ex parte Crow Dog, , is a {{decision}} of the Supreme Court of the United States that followed {{the death of one}} member of a Native American tribe at the hands of another on reservation land. Crow Dog {{was a member of the}} Brul√© band of the Lakota Sioux. On August5, 1881 he shot and killed Spotted Tail, a Lakota chief; there are different accounts of the background to the killing. The tribal council dealt with the incident according to Sioux tradition, and Crow Dog paid restitution to the dead man's family. However, the U.S. authorities then prosecuted Crow Dog for murder in a federal court. He was found guilty and sentenced to hang. The Supreme Court held that unless authorized by Congress, federal courts had no jurisdiction to try cases where the offense had already been tried by the tribal council. Crow Dog was therefore released. This case was the first time <b>in</b> <b>history</b> <b>that</b> an Indian was held on trial for the murder of another Indian. The case led to the Major Crimes Act in 1885, which placed some major crimes (initially seven, now 15) under federal jurisdiction if committed by an Indian against another Indian on a reservation or tribal land. This case was the beginning of the plenary power legal doctrine that has been used in Indian case law to limit tribal sovereignty.|$|E
