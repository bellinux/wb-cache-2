Carbohydrate accumulation, invertase activity, and expression of a purported sucrose synthase gene (RsSUS) was monitored during <b>flower</b> <b>forcing</b> under suboptimal (natural) and optimal (supplemental light) light conditions, after a cold treatment (7 °C + dark) to break flower bud dormancy. Post-production sucrose metabolism and flowering quality was also assessed. Glucose and fructose concentrations and invertase activity increased in petals during flowering, while sucrose decreased. In suboptimal light conditions RsSUS expression in leaves increased as compared to optimal light conditions, indicating that plants in suboptimal light conditions have a strong demand for carbohydrates. However, carbohydrates in leaves were markedly lower in suboptimal light conditions compared to optimal light conditions. This resulted in poor flowering of plants in suboptimal light conditions. Post-production flowering relied on the stored leaf carbon, which could be accumulated under optimal light conditions in the greenhouse. These results show that flower opening in azalea relies on carbohydrates imported from leaves and is source-limiting under suboptimal light conditions...|$|E

Introduction Branches from flowering trees and shrubs can be forced into bloom easily and inexpensively. Flowering branches can bring the outdoors inside and add color during a long winter. These branches also give the floral designer some unique and inexpensive alternatives. Trees and shrubs which bloom early in the spring form flower buds the previous fall before dormancy. After at least 8 weeks of cold weather (under 40 ° F) the branches are ready to overcome dormancy and are capable of blooming.

40|$|Camellia japonica L. is an {{evergreen}} shrub whose cultivars are {{of great}} ornamental value. In autumn, after flower bud differentiation, dormancy is initiated. As {{in many other}} spring flowering woody ornamentals, winter low temperatures promote dormancy release of both flower and vegetative buds. However, warm spells during late autumn and winter can lead to unfulfilled chilling requirements leading to erratic and delayed flowering. We hypothesized that storing plants at no light and low temperature could favor dormancy breaking and lead to early and synchronized flowering in response to forcing conditions in C. japonica ‘Nuccio’s Pearl’. Plants with fully developed floral primordia were stored at dark, 7 ∘C, and RH > 90 % for up to 8 weeks. To monitor endodormancy release during the storage, we evaluated the content of abscisic acid (ABA) in flower buds and the expression profiles of five putative genes related to dormancy and cold acclimation metabolism in leaves and flower buds. In addition, the expression of four anthocyanin biosynthesis pathway genes was profiled in flower buds to assess {{the effect of the}} treatment on flower pigment biosynthesis. At 0, 4, 6, and 8 weeks of cold treatment, 10 plants were transferred to the greenhouse and <b>forced</b> to <b>flower.</b> <b>Forced</b> plant <b>flower</b> qualities and growth were observed. The ABA content and the expression profiles of two dormancy-related genes (CjARP and CjDEH) suggested that dormancy breaking occurred after 6 – 8 weeks of cold treatment. Overall, plants treated for 6 – 8 weeks showed earlier vegetative sprouting, enhanced, and homogeneous <b>flowering</b> with reduced <b>forcing</b> time. Prolonged cold treatments also reduced flower size and longevity, anthocyanin content, and pigment biosynthesis-related gene transcripts. In conclusion, the cold treatment had a promotive effect on dormancy breaking but caused severe drawbacks on flower quality...|$|R

In this study, we have investigated the protein content, total protease activity, and cysteine protease activity {{at different stages of}} flowering (flower bud whitening and swelling, open flowers, wilted flowers) for lilac flowers (Syringa vulgaris L., fam. Oleaceae) blooming under three different conditions: natural conditions in May and forcing in a greenhouse in November at 37  °C (standard forcing) or at 15  °C (alternative forcing). The protein content was relatively constant during flowering {{for each of the three}} sets of conditions. Flowers from 15  °C had a significantly lower total protease and cysteine endoprotease activity than flowers from 37  °C at all stages. Flowers from plants blooming in May had a very time-specific cysteine protease activity, which was dramatically higher for the open flower stage than for the other stages. The partial coding sequence for a KDEL-CysEP was isolated, and its expression was determined by qRT-PCR. The gene expression did not correlate with the cysteine endoprotease activity especially in May natural flowering and November alternative forcing at 15  °C.

40|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{to improve the quality}} of chrysanthemum, this {{research}} is to explore the quality change of chrysanthemum cut flower under various amount of compression deformation and period of transportation as well as its relaxation and creeping behavor. By knowing information about compression effects, one can control the bud transformation and find the best size packing in practice. The results showed that the longer chrysanthemum cut flower was in the post-harvest process, the more broken leaves it had, the shorter its flowers and leaves lasted, and smaller its blossoms were. It was also showed that the amount of brokeneaves increased and the size of blossoms decreased when chrysanthemum cut flower was packed in the lower layers of packages. The force relaxation of chrysanthemum cut flower was predicted by a Generalized Maxwell model which consisted of three parallel Maxwell elements. According to an equation of chrysanthemum cut <b>flower</b> <b>force</b> relaxation, it was predicted that in the condition of 10 mm deformation, the relaxation force of chrysanthemum cut flower buds would became " 0 " after 15 hours. Thus, the beginning deformation would become permanent. Therefore, for the lower layer packages of chrysanthemumcut flower, its allowable amount of deformation should be the added value of the beginning deformation and its deformation during the saving period cause by its creeping behavior. In the case of chrysanthemum cut flower with an average weight of 60 g, its deformation was 1. 52 mm after saving for 12 days. Since the allowable deformation for chrysanthemum buds was 5 mm, the beginning deformation should be less than 3. 84 mm. So, for a package of 200 pieces of chrysanthemum cutflower, the best height of its package should be 26. 8 cm. 菊花栽培與外銷為台灣中部地區一項重要的產業，本研究主要目的在於探 討台灣地區輸日菊花在現行包裝儲運過程中，菊花花苞在不同的壓縮量與 不同儲運時間下之品質變化，以及菊花花苞受壓縮後之負荷鬆弛與潛變現 象，以控制花苞之變形量，求取最佳之包裝紙箱尺寸，以改善菊花外銷品 質。根據本研究顯示，外銷菊花在現行儲運方式下，破損葉片數、葉片壽 命、花朵壽命、花朵開度等各項品質指標均隨儲存時間之延長呈顯著下降 趨勢，且位於紙箱下層之菊花其破損葉片數量較上層有極顯著之增加，花 朵開度方面較上層亦有顯著之減小。菊花花苞之負荷鬆弛特性可用三個馬 克斯威爾元件並聯所組成的一般化馬克斯威爾模式來預測。根據所得之負 荷鬆弛特性方程式預測，菊花花苞在 10 mm變形量之下，經過 15 小時以後， 其內部應力將降為"零"，因此裝箱時之初始變形量都將成為永久變形，因 此最下層菊花花苞可容許之最大變形量，應為裝箱時之初始壓縮變形量與 下層菊花於儲存期間，因潛變因素所增加之變形量兩者之總和。以單枝平 均重量 60 g之菊花為例，冷藏儲存 12 天後，菊花花苞因潛變因素所導致之 變形量為 1. 52 mm，而菊花花苞容許之最大變形量為 5 mm，因此在裝箱時菊 花花苞之最大可容許壓縮變形量應為 3. 84 mm，故每箱 200 支菊花之包裝方 式，其紙箱之最佳高度應為 26. 8 cm...|$|R

This thesis is concerned with the development of a technique to differentiate apple sports using pollen exine patterns. Scanning electron microscopy was used to capture images of the apple pollen grain and the exine surface. A digital image analysis algorithm was developed to extract quantitative data from the pollen grain dimensions and pore characteristics, and a Fast Fourier transform extracted quantitative data from the ridge patterns.

The successful utilization of plants in space will require the development of not only highly productive growing systems but also highly efficient bioregenerative systems. It {{will be necessary to}} recycle all inedible plant parts and all human wastes so that the entire complement of elemental compounds can be reused. Potatoes have been proposed as one of the desirable crops because they are 1) extremely productive, yielding more than 100 metric tons per hectare from field plantings, 2) the edible tubers are high in digestible starch (70 %) and protein (10 %) on a dry weight basis, 3) up to 80 % of the total plant production is in tubers and thus edible, 4) the plants are easily propagated either from tubers or from tissue culture plantlets, 5) the tubers can be utilized with a minimum of processing, and 6) potatoes can be prepared in a variety of different forms for the human diet (Tibbitts et al., 1982). However potatoes have a growth pattern that complicates the development of growing the plants in controlled systems.

Microscopic observations showed that flower initiation in PGR treated plants was enhanced by 12 days for ‘H. Vogel’, but was unchanged for ‘Kint’. Differentiation was only slightly enhanced (2 - 4 days) compared to the control plants. When the floral primordia were fully developed cold treatments (7 °C for 2 to 8 weeks) to fulfill flower bud dormancy requirements were applied. Results show that the late flowering cultivar ‘Mw. Kint’ has a stronger dormancy than the early flowering cultivar ‘H. Vogel’. Subsequently a longer period at 7 °C is necessary for ideal flowering. For both ‘Mw. Kint’ and ‘H. Vogel’, PGR treated plants have a stronger dormancy, resulting in delayed <b>flowering</b> when <b>forcing</b> the plants at 21 °C...|$|R

5000|$|Infection of host plants (including Arabis {{and several}} {{other members of the}} mustard family) occurs via wind-borne basidiospores in late summer. Upon {{germination}} of the spores, fungal hyphae penetrate the stem of the mustard plant and siphon off nutrients. However, in order to reproduce sexually, the fungus must facilitate the transfer of spermatia from the spermatogonia on this plant to receptive hyphae borne in the spermatogonia on another infected mustard plant. To accomplish this, the fungus sterilizes the host plant, preventing it from producing true <b>flowers.</b> Instead, it <b>forces</b> the infected plant to grow clusters of leaves into brilliant yellow [...] "pseudoflowers" [...] bearing the fungal spermatogonia. Insects visiting the pseudoflowers transfer spermatia from one host plant to another, {{in the same way that}} pollinators transfer pollen between the true flowers of uninfected plants.|$|R
