5000|$|Long polyyne {{chains are}} said to be {{inherently}} unstable in bulk because they can cross-link with each other in an <b>exothermal</b> (indeed explosive) reaction. [...] Explosions are a real hazard in this area of research. They can be fairly stable, even against moisture and oxygen, if they are end-capped with suitable inert groups (such as tert-butyl or trifluoromethyl) rather than hydrogen atoms, especially bulky ones that can keep the chains apart. [...] In 1995 the preparation of carbyne chains with over 300 carbons was reported using this technique. However the report has been contested by a claim that the detected molecules were fullerene-like structures rather than long polyynes.|$|E

Beyond the <b>exothermal</b> effect, the ammonium chloride and sodium nitrite package count with its effervescent reaction to remove wax deposits.

40|$|An anomaly in {{differential}} scanning calorimetry {{has been}} reported in a number of metallic glass materials in which a broad <b>exothermal</b> peak was observed between the glass and crystallization temperatures. The mystery surrounding this calorimetric anomaly is epitomized by four decades long studies of Pd-Ni-P metallic glasses, arguably the best glass-forming alloys. Here we show, using a suite of in situ experimental techniques, that Pd-Ni-P alloys have a hidden amorphous phase in the supercooled liquid region. The anomalous <b>exothermal</b> peak is the consequence of a polyamorphous phase transition between two supercooled liquids, involving a change in the packing of atomic clusters over medium-range length scales as large as 18 Å. With further temperature increase, the alloy reenters the supercooled liquid phase, which forms the room-temperature glass phase on quenching. The outcome of this study raises a possibility to manipulate the structure and hence the stability of metallic glasses through heat treatment...|$|E

30|$|The second {{peak in the}} <b>exothermal</b> {{curve is}} formed because of the {{hydration}} of C 3 S (Runzhang 1996). It {{can be seen from}} Fig.  2 c that the arrival time of the second peaks are 516, 528, 536, 537, and 679  min, respectively. The LP shifts the peak position to the left, which shows that the hydration of cement is accelerated by the LP. However, the appearances of the second peaks delays by 1 and 143  min by the QP and the GP, respectively; this shows that the QP has no obvious effect on the hydration of C 3 S and the GP has obvious effect. The values of the second peak are 2.48, 2.45, 2.40, 2.12, and 2.03  mW, according to the CN, the CG, the CL 2, the CQ and the CL 1. It can be concluded that the SPs, especially for the QP and the GP, decreases the concentration of hydration heat from the two <b>exothermal</b> peaks.|$|E

Under differential thermogravimetric analysis, all the samples presented a main <b>exothermal</b> event, whose temperature varied among resins of different age.
