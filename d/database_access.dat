25|$|During HyperCard's peak {{popularity}} in the late 1980s, a whole ecosystem of vendors offered thousands of these externals for everything from HyperTalk compilers to graphing systems, <b>database</b> <b>access,</b> internet connectivity, and animation. Oracle offered an XCMD that allowed HyperCard to directly query Oracle databases on any platform. This was later superseded by Oracle's Oracle Card product. BeeHive Technologies offered a hardware interface that allowed the computer to control external devices. Connected via the Apple Desktop Bus (ADB), this instrument could read the state of connected external switches or write digital outputs to a multitude of devices.|$|E
25|$|Most wikis {{offer at}} least a title search, and {{sometimes}} a full-text search. The scalability of the search depends on whether the wiki engine uses a database. Some wikis, such as PmWiki, use flat files. MediaWiki's first versions used flat files, but it was rewritten by Lee Daniel Crocker in the early 2000s (decade) to be a database application. Indexed <b>database</b> <b>access</b> is necessary for high speed searches on large wikis. Alternatively, external search engines such as Google Search can sometimes be used on wikis with limited searching functions {{in order to obtain}} more precise results.|$|E

A new five-storey Rizal Library building was completed in 2009 and opened in November of the same year, housing the library's circulation section, the undergraduate and graduate reserve sections, the multimedia collection, the periodicals collection, the Japanese collection, online <b>database</b> <b>access</b> terminals, an information commons, and the Library's technical services facilities.

2500|$|OLE DB is the <b>database</b> <b>access</b> {{interface}} {{technology used}} by MDAC. OLE DB providers {{can be created}} to access such simple data stores as a text file or spreadsheet, through to such complex databases as Oracle and SQL Server. However, because different data store technology can have different capabilities, OLE DB providers may not implement every possible interface available. The capabilities that are available are implemented {{through the use of}} COM objects an OLE DB provider will map the data store technology's functionality to a particular COM interface. Microsoft calls the availability of an interface to be [...] "provider-specific" [...] as it may not be applicable depending on the database technology involved. Additionally, however, providers may also augment the capabilities of a data store; these capabilities are known as services in Microsoft parlance.|$|E
2500|$|The {{latest version}} of MDAC (2.8) {{consists}} of several interacting components, {{all of which are}} Windows specific except for ODBC (which is available on several platforms). MDAC architecture may be viewed as three layers: a programming interface layer, consisting of ADO and ADO.NET, a <b>database</b> <b>access</b> layer developed by database vendors such as Oracle and Microsoft (OLE DB, [...]NET managed providers and ODBC drivers), and the database itself. These component layers are all made available to applications through the MDAC API. The Microsoft SQL Server Network Library, a proprietary access method specific to Microsoft SQL Server, is also included in the MDAC. Developers of Windows applications are encouraged to use ADO or ADO.NET for data access, the benefit being that users of the application program are not constrained in their choice of database architecture except that it should be supported by MDAC. Naturally, developers still have the choice of writing applications which directly access OLE DB and ODBC.|$|E

2500|$|On Windows 95, the MKDE {{interface}} (a Windows {{dynamic link}} library (DLL) called WBTRV32.DLL) determines what <b>database</b> <b>access</b> method is in use via the configuration file. If it detects both the client/server and workstation engines are installed on the same machine, it checks whether the target is set to workstation or server. If running on Windows NT and the server process NTMKDE.EXE is running along with the standalone workstation process W32MKDE.EXE it looks in the registry {{to determine if the}} target is a server or workstation. In both cases, if the MKDE interface is set to workstation, (the [...] "Standalone workstation" [...] configuration) it uses the MKDE (W32MKDE.EXE) to access the file directly. If it is set to server, the MKDE interface on the client uses a communications module (on Windows 95 this is W32BTICM.DLL, on Windows NT this is NTBTICM.DLL) that [...] "talks" [...] to the server. The server itself has its own matching communications module (again either W32BTICM.DLL or NTBTICM.DLL) that resides on the mapped drive. The server DLL communicates with the server MKDE (NTMKDE.EXE) which updates records, then sends a confirmation that the operation succeeded, back through the communications module to the client.|$|E
