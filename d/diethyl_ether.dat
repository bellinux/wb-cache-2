Increased iodine intake, selenium, and vitamin D deficiency, exposure to radiation, from nuclear fallout or due to medical radiation, are environmental factors increasing AITD.

Viral infections are important environmental factors in the pathogenesis of AITD, too, particularly human parvovirus B 19 (EVB 19) and hepatitis C virus. Among the many chemical contaminants, halogenated organochlorines and pesticides variably disrupt thyroid function.

5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} <b>diethyl</b> <b>ether.</b> In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease in blood pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases in blood pressure, as well as increases in blood glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine. In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease in blood pressure, but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed.

In humans, methoxyflurane causes a dose-dependent decrease in tidal volume and minute volume, with respiratory rate relatively constant.

5|$|Meanwhile, it {{had been}} known since 1748 that it was {{possible}} to artificially chill water with mechanical equipment and attempts were made in the late 1850s to produce artificial ice on a commercial scale. Various methods had been invented to do this, including Jacob Perkins's <b>diethyl</b> <b>ether</b> vapor-compression refrigeration engine, invented in 1834; engines that used pre-compressed air; John Gorrie's air cycle engines; and ammonia-based approaches such as those championed by Ferdinand Carré and Charles Tellier. The resulting product was variously called plant or artificial ice, but there were numerous obstacles to manufacturing it commercially. Producing plant ice required large amounts of fuel, in the form of coal, and capital for machinery, so producing ice at a competitive price was challenging. The early technology was unreliable and for many decades ice plants faced the risk of explosions and consequent damage to the surrounding buildings. Ammonia based approaches potentially left hazardous ammonia in the ice from where it had leaked through the joints of machinery. For most of the 19th century, plant ice was not as clear as much natural ice, sometimes left white residue when it melted and was generally regarded as less suitable for human consumption than the natural product.|$|E
40|$|Oxymethylene {{dimethyl}} ethers (CH 3 O(CH 2 O) nCH 3) bearing 3 to 5 CH 2 O-units (OMDME 3 - 5) {{are promising}} diesel additives, {{as they are}} able to reduce soot and NOx emissions. However, due to economic restrictions, an industrial synthesis process for these compounds has not been realized yet. As presented in this thesis, it was possible to synthesize oligomeric OMDME from dimethoxymethane (DMM) and trioxane (TRI), catalyzed by solid acids, in a more efficient and economical way as described in the literature. For the first time, it was possible to carry out the synthesis of OMDME at atmospheric pressure and mild reaction temperatures below 40 °C, maintaining high reactivity. Besides optimizing process parameters and testing of catalysts, reaction kinetics were also evaluated and determined. Furthermore, the synthesis of oxymethylene <b>diethyl</b> <b>ethers</b> (OMDEE) and oxymethylene diacetate (OMDAc) was investigated and compared with each other. The oligomerization of OMDME is a typical equilibrium reaction. In addition to DMM and TRI as starting materials, a series of oligomeric OMDME are also present in the equilibrium. All tests showed that the OMDME product mixture follows the Schulz-Flory distribution, even with varying DMM/TRI ratios. Solid acids, such as cation exchanger resins and zeolites, served as catalysts. Out of all tested resins and zeolites, Amberlyst 36 among resins and BEA 25 among zeolites exhibited the strongest catalytic activity. The chemical equilibrium was reached within a few minutes at room temperature. However, this high reactivity was only possible, when the synthesis of OMDME was performed in the absence of water, as minor traces of water already caused a significant loss of catalyst activity. For the first time, it was further possible to verify that during the oligomerization the direct insertion of TRI into DMM takes place. This was observed due to an increased OMDME 4 concentration {{at the beginning of the}} reaction. Because of these and other results, a detailed reaction mechanism was postulated, which implies the insertion of TRI into the catalytically activated DMM. The proven high rate of transacetalization in the OMDME reaction led to the Schulz-Flory distribution even before chemical equilibrium was reached. ...|$|R

Research has shown that environmental chemicals such as flame-retardants induce hepatic enzymes in the cytochrome P 450 family such as CYP 24 and CYP 3 A {{that are important in}} vitamin D metabolism. To determine if exposure to one class of flame-retardants known as polybrominated <b>diethyl</b> <b>ethers</b> (PBDEs) promotes vitamin D deficiency, 15 rats consumed a diet marginally deficient in Vitamin D - 85 IU Vitamin D/kg diet - for 56 days. On day 28 of the experiment, 7 rats were gavaged daily with 7 mg/kg BW PBDEs and 8 rats were gavaged daily with corn oil, for 28 days. Body weight and food intake were measured three times a week, vitamin D status markers in the urine were measured at weeks 4 and 8 and blood Vitamin D metabolites along with liver weight were measured at euthanization. Liver microsomal vitamin D metabolism, composition and CYP 3 A enzyme activity were also measured. The final body weight tended to be lower in the treatment animals than in the control but was not significantly different (370. 29 ± 40. 12 vs. 400. 63 ± 31. 99, respectively, p = 0. 0636).

40|$|The {{potential}} use of electron-deficient heterocyclic azo compounds as inkjet dyes was explored. 2 -Nitrosopyridine {{could be}} used to form a series of azo compounds via the Mills’ reaction with electron-rich aromatic amines. Conditions for this process were optimised by varying solvent and pH. In the presence of ethers, 2 -nitrosopyridine is quickly reduced to azoxypyridine. This reaction follows first order kinetics; <b>diethyl</b> and diisopropyl <b>ether</b> react at similar rates, whereas cyclic ethers such as THF are far slower. Organic bases such as Hunigs base were also found to promote formation of azoxypyridine. The mechanism of this reduction was studied. The electrochemistry of 2 -nitrosopyridine and azoxypyridine was also explored. Using the optimised conditions for the Mills’ reaction, 2 -nitrosopyridine not only reacts with electron-rich amines but also electron-deficient examples. The series was also expanded to include other heterocycles as well as pyridine via the corresponding heterocyclic nitroso compound. Other nitroso compounds prepared were 1 - nitrosoisoquinoline, 2 -nitrosopyrazine, 4 -nitrosopyrimidine and 2 -nitrosopyrimidine. The absorption maxima of azo compounds prepared from these precursors were found to correlate with the values for the corresponding azobenzenes. 2 -Nitrosopyridine and 2 -nitrosopyrimidine react with diamines to give monoazo products. These in turn could be diazotised and coupled with various components to give either bisazo or trisazo compounds. These dyes were tested for their ozone and light fastness properties. The bisazo examples were found to have good ozone fastness but poor light fastness.

40|$|Identification of {{the trace}} odorants causing the septic odors in source waters with complex matrixes {{has long been}} a big challenge. The Huangpu (HP) River, an {{important}} source water for Shanghai, has long been suffering from septic and musty odors, although major odorants have not been identified. In this study, combining the data from gas chromatography-olfactometry with mass spectrometry (GC-O/MS) and comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography with time-of-flight mass spectrometry (GC x GC-TOFMS) using retention indices (RIs) was used for the identification of odorants in HP source water. Olfactometry peaks detected in water extracts by GC-O/MS were combined with the chromatography peaks detected by GC x GC-TOFMS based on the RIs determined using the retention times (RTs) of alkanes C 7 -C 30. A total of thirteen olfactometry peaks were obtained though GC-O/MS analysis, and potential odorants corresponding to each of the olfactometry peaks were screened based on the odor characteristics and match similarity using GC x GC-TOFMS. Finally, fourteen odorants (one odorant was detected in GC x GC-TOFMS without an olfactometry peak), including three septic odorants (bis(2 -chloroisopropyl) <b>ether,</b> <b>diethyl</b> disulfide and dimethyl disulfide) and two musty ones (geosmin and 2 -MIB), were confirmed by using authentic standards. The septic and musty odorants in six source water samples taken over a period of six months were quantified. Bis(2 -chloroisopropyl) ether, with an odor activity value (OAV) of 1. 84 - 3. 2, was found to be a major septic odorant in HP source water, followed by diethyl disulfide (OAV 1. 56 - 1. 96) and dimethyl disulfide (OAV 0. 37 - 2. 42), while geosmin (OAV 4. 37 - 11. 44) was the major musty odorant, followed by 2 -MIB (OAV 1. 13 - 1. 89). This is the first comprehensive study focusing on the identification of odorants in a complex source water.

40|$|Oligo(vinyl ethers) with {{functionalised}} end {{groups were}} produced through the alkylation of silyl enol ethers in ab initio cationic polymerisations. In {{order to obtain}} high degrees of chain end functionality {{a great deal of}} care was taken in choosing the monomer concentration, the reaction temperature, Lewis acids and the concentration of silyl enol ether. The experiment also required the use of highly nucleophilic species such as silyl ketene acetal, which react with carbocations at similar rates to vinyl ethers. Rapid elimination of the primary adduct produced the ester end-groups. MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry was used to analyse the oligomers obtained and to assess the side reactions and chain end functionalisation processes. 	Oligo(methyl vinyl ether) s were synthesised in cationic polymerisations using the HCl-isobutyl vinyl ether/SnCl 4 initiating system within the polymerisation temperature range - 26 °C to - 78 °C, {{and in the absence of}} an end-capping agent. It was observed that the use of a lower temperature yielded well-defined oligomers. Furthermore, during the polymerisation the silyl enol ether reactivity suppressed the termination rate and oligomethyl vinyl ether with increased levels of ester end groups were then produced. In addition, a size exclusion chromatograph was calibrated using MALDI-TOF MS to obtain molecular weights of narrow fractions (SEC-MALDI TOF). The Kuhn-Mark-Houwink relation for oligo(methyl vinyl ether) was then established. In the light of the above, it was possible to infer that the solution coil conformation is dependent on the end group structure. 	Oligo(isobutyl vinyl ethers) were also prepared successfully at different temperatures (- 26 and - 78 °C) in the presence of a silyl enol ether using HCl-iBVE/TiCl 4 as the initiating system. At a lower temperature, and with a high concentration of silyl enol ether, the normal termination reactions were suppressed and oligo(isobutyl vinyl ethers) with a high ester group chain end functionality were produced. This phenomenon can be attributed to the fact that, at lower reaction temperatures, the rate of propagation relative to the rate of termination and the control of polymerisation was observed. Another means by which oligo(isobutyl vinyl ethers) were prepared in this experiment with ester end groups was by using continuous reaction processes. These processes are commonly applied in many industrial applications as they allow for the production of large quantities of polymer in a short period of time. These particular polymerisations were applied by using HCl-iBVE as an initiating system with SnCl 4 and TiCl 4 as Lewis acids at - 15 °C. The production of oligomers with a high degree of ester group functionality was carried out by the use of SnCl 4 with a high concentration of silyl enol ether at a slow flow rate. 	It was also possible to produce highly branched functional polymers by using continuous processes. In this instance, isobutyl vinyl ether was used as a first monomer with <b>diethyl</b> divinyl <b>ether</b> (DEDVE) and divinyl benzene (DVBz) being used as second monomers in the presence of silyl enol ether at a temperature of - 15 °C. Many different Lewis acids were used in these polymerisation reactions It was observed that the polymerisation of iBVE with DEDVE was only successful by using Sc(OTf) 3 as a Lewis acid. Highly branched polymers with ester group functionality were detected at a monomer ratio of 9 : 1 with a low concentration of silyl enol ether at a high feed rate. In the polymerisation of iBVE with DVBz, only two Lewis acids successfully aided these reactions (ZnI 2 /HI and Sc(OTf) 3). In ZnI 2 /HI, a low concentration of silyl enol ether with a high flow time was found to form highly branched polymers with the chain end group. In using Sc(OTf) 3, a high concentration of SEE with a low feed rate was shown to produce highly branched functional polymers. By analysing the aforementioned information it was possible to deduce that the feed rate and the concentration of silyl enol ether had a substantial effect on the chain end attained. ...|$|R
