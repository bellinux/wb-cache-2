50|$|In 1941 Lashkaryouv {{published}} his fundamental discovery, {{the presence of}} a semiconductor layer between the barrier layer and the adjacent electrode, and the opposite sign of charge carriers (electrons and holes) on both sides of a barrier layer in solar cells of Cu2O and silver sulphide photocells and selenium rectifiers.

During World War II, Lashkaryov worked in the city of Ufa on cuprous-oxide devices for defense needs.

50|$|The basic {{components}} of analog circuits are wires, resistors, capacitors, inductors, <b>diodes,</b> <b>and</b> <b>transistors.</b> (In 2012 it was demonstrated that memristors {{can be added}} to the list of available components.) Analog circuits are very commonly represented in schematic diagrams, in which wires are shown as lines, and each component has a unique symbol. Analog circuit analysis employs Kirchhoff's circuit laws: all the currents at a node (a place where wires meet), and the voltage around a closed loop of wires is 0. Wires are usually treated as ideal zero-voltage interconnections; any resistance or reactance is captured by explicitly adding a parasitic element, such as a discrete resistor or inductor. Active components such as transistors are often treated as controlled current or voltage sources: for example, a field-effect transistor can be modeled as a current source from the source to the drain, with the current controlled by the gate-source voltage.|$|E
50|$|A simple {{alternative}} to the Baker clamp is a single low-voltage diode from the collector to the base.

An alternative diode clamp circuit connects the diode to a junction of two base-bias resistors.The contemporary solution is to integrate the combination of a Schottky <b>diode</b> <b>and</b> <b>transistor</b> into one Schottky transistor.
