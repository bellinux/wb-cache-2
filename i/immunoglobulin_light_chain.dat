5|$|In mammals {{there are}} two types of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chain,</b> which are called lambda (λ) and kappa (κ). A light chain has two {{successive}} domains: one constant domain and one variable domain. The approximate length of a light chain is 211 to 217 amino acids. Each antibody contains two light chains that are always identical; only one type of light chain, κ or λ, is present per antibody in mammals. Other types of light chains, such as the iota (ι) chain, are found in other vertebrates like sharks (Chondrichthyes) and bony fishes (Teleostei).|$|E
25|$|Immunoglobulin light chains {{that are}} {{circulating}} in serum {{in a free}} (unbound) state are called free light chains (FLCs). Measurement of the serum level of FLCs became practical as a clinical blood test in recent decades. These tests are used as an aid in the diagnosis and monitoring of multiple myeloma and related disorders. There {{are two types of}} <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> produced in humans, designated by the Greek letters kappa (κ) and lambda (λ). Comparing the ratio of κ FLCs to λ FLCs in a person's serum against reference ranges indicates whether that person may have a plasma cell tumour such as multiple myeloma or AL amyloidosis.|$|E

40|$|Impaired immune {{function}} {{is common in}} patients with chronic renal failure. Now, we determined whether serum levels of free <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> predict mortality in patients with chronic kidney disease stage 5 on hemodialysis patients. We performed a prospective cohort study of 160 hemodialysis patients with a median follow-up of 15 month (interquartile range, 3 - 44 months). Serum levels of free κ and λ <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were measured {{at the start of}} the study. The primary endpoint was mortality from any cause. During follow-up, 87 patients (54 %) died. In survivors median serum levels of free κ plus λ <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were significantly higher compared with non-survivors (p< 0. 05). Survival was significantly longer in those patients that had serum levels of free κ plus λ <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> above the median compared with patients with serum levels below the median of 210 mg/L (χ²= 5. 91; p= 0. 015 by Log-rank (Mantel-Cox) Test). It is concluded that higher serum levels of free κ plus λ <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> improve survival in hemodialysis patients...|$|R
25|$|If <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> are {{produced}} in sufficient amounts {{to overwhelm the}} proximal tubules’ absorption mechanisms (usually due {{to the presence of}} a plasma cell tumour) the <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> enter the distal tubules and can appear in the urine (Bence Jones protein). The passage of large amounts of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> through the kidneys may cause inflammation or blockage of the kidney tubules.|$|R
40|$|Platelet satellitism is {{believed}} to be an in vitro phenomenon induced at room temperature in ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid–anticoagulated blood. Most reports involve neutrophils; involvement with circulating lymphoma cells are exceedingly rare. Normally, mature B cells exhibit allelic exclusion in which a single class of surface <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> (either κ or λ) is expressed. The simultaneous expression of both κ and λ <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> is rare. Herein, we report the unusual case of a patient with splenic marginal zone lymphoma in which circulating lymphoma cells express dual surface <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> and exhibit platelet satellitism.

40|$|The sera of {{autoimmune}} {{and other}} mouse strains were analysed by high resolution two dimensional gel electrophoresis and silver staining.

40|$|Deposition of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> is {{a result}} of clonal {{proliferation}} of monoclonal plasma cells that secrete free <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains,</b> also called Bence Jones proteins (Bence Jones proteins).

BJP from patients with AL, LCDD and MM were purified from their urine and studies were performed to determine their secondary structure, thermodynamic stability and aggregate formation kinetics. Our results show that LCDD and MM proteins have the lowest free energy of folding while all proteins show similar melting temperatures. Incubation of the BJP at their melting temperature produced morphologically different aggregates: amyloid fibrils from the AL proteins, amorphous aggregates from the LCDD proteins and large spherical species from the MM proteins.

40|$|Abstract: <b>Light</b> <b>chain</b> (AL) {{amyloidosis}} is {{a devastating}} disease characterized by amyloid deposits formed by <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains.</b> Current available treatments involve conventional chemotherapy and autologous stem cell transplant. We have recently concluded a phase III trial comparing these two treatments. AL amyloidosis patients who achieve hematological complete response (CR) {{do not necessarily}} achieve organ response regardless of the treatment they received. In order to investigate the possible correlation between amyloid formation kinetics and organ response, we selected AL amyloidosis patients from the trial with kidney involvement and CR after treatment. Six patients were selected and their monoclonal <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> were characterized. The proteins showed differences in their stability and their kinetics of amyloid formation. A correlation was detected at pH 7. 4, showing that less stable proteins {{are more likely to}} form amyloid fibrils. AL-T 03 is too unstable to form amyloid fibrils at pH 7. 4.

5000|$|A myeloma {{protein is}} an {{abnormal}} immunoglobulin fragment, {{such as an}} <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chain,</b> that is produced in excess by an abnormal monoclonal proliferation of plasma cells, typically in multiple myeloma. Other terms for such a protein are M protein, M component, M spike, spike protein, or paraprotein. This proliferation of the myeloma protein has several deleterious effects on the body, including impaired immune function, abnormally high blood viscosity ("thickness" [...] of the blood), and kidney damage.|$|E
50|$|In 1989, David Baltimore's lab {{discovered}} {{the first two}} E-box binding proteins, E12 and E47. These immunoglobulin enhancers could bind as heterodimers to proteins through bHLH domains. In 1990, another E-protein, ITF-2A (later renamed E2-2Alt) was discovered that can bind to <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> enhancers. Two years later, the third E-box binding protein, HEB, was discovered by screening a cDNA library from HeLa cells. A splice-variant of the E2-2 was discovered in 1997 and was found to inhibit the promoter of a muscle-specific gene.|$|E

40|$|There are {{two major}} forms of {{amyloidosis}}, primary amyloidosis (AL) and secondary amyloid-osis. AL amyloidosis results from deposition of <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> or their fragments. One such example is AL amyloidosis associated with multiple myeloma, in which overproduced <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chains</b> get deposited onto tissues, leading to tissue dysfunction. Amyloidosis in the intestines can present as {{a wide spectrum of}} non-specific gastrointestinal (GI) complaints including abdominal pain, changes in bowel habits, overt gastrointestinal bleed-ing and complaints related to altered motility in over 95 % of the patients. In our case report, we describe a 70 -year-old male taken to the operating room (OR) for non-resolving small bowel ob-struction, found to have pseudo-obstruction and hemorrhagic enteritis. He was also diagnosed with multiple myeloma from a bone marrow biopsy and later biopsy of stomach and duodenum revealed amyloid deposition consistent with amyloidosis.

Association of the CD79a/b heterodimer with the immunoglobulin heavy chain is required for surface expression of the BCR and BCR induced calcium flux and protein tyrosine phosphorylation. Genetic deletion of the transmembrane exon of CD79A results in loss of CD79a protein and a complete block of B cell development at the pro to pre B cell transition. Similarly, humans with homozygous splice variants in CD79A predicted to result in loss of the transmembrane region and a truncated or absent protein display agammaglobulinemia and no peripheral B cells.|$|E
50|$|The kappa (κ) and lambda (λ) {{chains of}} the <b>immunoglobulin</b> <b>light</b> <b>chain</b> loci {{rearrange}} {{in a very}} similar way, except that the light chains lack a D segment.
