5|$|Duncan and Fogarty (1984) {{argued that}} the <b>key</b> <b>difference</b> lies in the {{contrast}} between the stable, flexible government of Australia and the poor governance of Argentina. According to Platt and Di Tella (1985) the political tradition and immigration from different regions were the key factors, while Díaz Alejandro (1985) suggested that a restrictive immigration policy, similar to Australia’s, would have increased productivity encouraged by the relative scarcity of labour.|$|E
5|$|In February 2013, Gavyn Davies for The Financial Times {{emphasized}} that a <b>key</b> <b>difference</b> between the 1930s and the 21st century outbreaks {{is that in}} the thirties some of the retaliations between countries were carried out not by devaluations, but by increases in import tariffs, which tend to be much more disruptive to international trade.|$|E
5|$|The <b>key</b> <b>difference</b> between QA {{technology}} and document search is that document search takes a keyword query and returns {{a list of}} documents, ranked in order of relevance to the query (often based on popularity and page ranking), while QA technology takes a question expressed in natural language, seeks to understand it in much greater detail, and returns a precise answer to the question.|$|E

5|$|Hero. A {{version of}} the team deathmatch where a hero is {{randomly}} selected on both sides for one minute, or until the hero dies. The hero gets a health boost, damage boost, and every weapon in the game (which the hero can keep if he survives the one minute). The <b>key</b> <b>difference</b> between Hero and TDM is that in TDM all enemy kills are counted to the team total whereas in Hero, only when killing the Hero or when the Hero kills an enemy are they counted towards the total.|$|E
5|$|Here the <b>key</b> <b>difference</b> {{to notice}} {{is that there}} is no surface tension between the solid and the vapor for the second surface tension component. This is because of the {{assumption}} that the surface of air that is exposed is under the droplet and is the only other substrate in the system. Subsequently, the equation is then expressed as (1 – f). Therefore, the Cassie equation can be easily derived from the Cassie–Baxter equation. Experimental results regarding the surface properties of Wenzel versus Cassie–Baxter systems showed the effect of pinning for a Young angle of 180 to 90°, a region classified under the Cassie–Baxter model. This liquid/air composite system is largely hydrophobic. After that point, a sharp transition to the Wenzel regime was found where the drop wets the surface, but no further than edges of the drop.|$|E
5|$|Each dream {{acts as a}} {{character}} study, exploring the fears and future of the dreamer. Willow, Xander, and Giles are stalked by a shadowy figure, then killed within their dreams. The way in which each is killed {{is directly related to}} the role they had assumed when melding with Buffy in the previous episode—that role is indicated by the Tarot-like card used to symbolize the character's essence. Willow's card had been Spiritus, representing her magical powers; she is killed by having her spirit sucked out of her. Xander's card had been Animus, representing his heart; he is killed by having his heart ripped out. Giles had been represented by the card Sophus, a symbol of his intellect and role as teacher; he is killed by being scalped. Buffy's card, Manus, was representative of her physical strength. In her dream the stalker is revealed as the primitive, first slayer, who confronts her aggressively. The two fight, but the First Slayer is defeated when Buffy realizes a <b>key</b> <b>difference</b> between them: the First Slayer was alone and isolated, while Buffy is unique among Slayers in that she has friends and a life beyond slaying, factors which make her the greatest Slayer ever.|$|E

5|$|Following the Smithsonian Agreement, {{member states}} of the European Economic Community adopted a {{narrower}} currency band of 1.125% for exchange rates among their own currencies, creating a smaller scale fixed exchange rate system known as the snake in the tunnel. The snake proved unsustainable as it did not compel EEC countries to coordinate macroeconomic policies. In 1979, the European Monetary System (EMS) phased out the currency snake. The EMS featured two key components: the European Currency Unit (ECU), an artificial weighted average market basket of European Union members' currencies, and the Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), a procedure for managing exchange rate fluctuations in keeping with a calculated parity grid of currencies' par values. The parity grid was derived from parities each participating country established for its currency with all other currencies in the system, denominated in terms of ECUs. The weights within the ECU changed in response to variances in the values of each currency in its basket. Under the ERM, if an exchange rate reached its upper or lower limit (within a 2.25% band), both nations in that currency pair were obligated to intervene collectively in the foreign exchange market and buy or sell the under- or overvalued currency as necessary to return the exchange rate to its par value according to the parity matrix. The requirement of cooperative market intervention marked a <b>key</b> <b>difference</b> from the Bretton Woods system. Similarly to Bretton Woods however, EMS members could impose capital controls and other monetary policy shifts on countries responsible for exchange rates approaching their bounds, as identified by a divergence indicator which measured deviations from the ECU's value. The central exchange rates of the parity grid could be adjusted in exceptional circumstances, and were modified every eight months on average during the systems' initial four years of operation. During its twenty-year lifespan, these central rates were adjusted over 50 times.|$|E

25|$|On November 7, 2006, Donnelly {{defeated}} Chocola 54%-46%, {{a difference}} of 15,145 votes. The <b>key</b> <b>difference</b> between the 2006 and 2004 elections for Donnelly lay in the results within St. Joseph County, the location of South Bend and {{by far the largest}} county in the district. Donnelly won that county with 58% of vote, generating a 14,000-vote margin.|$|E
25|$|Openhole {{completions}} (in {{comparison with}} cemented pipe) require {{better understanding of}} formation damage, wellbore clean-up and fluid loss control. A <b>key</b> <b>difference</b> is that perforating penetrates through the first 6-18 inches (15–45cm) of formation around the wellbore, whilst openhole completions require the reservoir fluids to flow {{through all of the}} filtrate-invaded zone around the wellbore and lift-off of the mud filter cake.|$|E

The <b>key</b> <b>difference</b> between plutonium-239 and uranium-235 is that plutonium emits fewer delayed neutrons than uranium when it undergoes fission.|$|E

25|$|Similar to {{thermomechanical}} exergy, chemical exergy {{depends on}} the temperature and pressure of a system {{as well as on}} the composition. The <b>key</b> <b>difference</b> in evaluating chemical exergy versus thermomechanical exergy is that thermomechanical exergy does not take into account the difference in a system and environment's chemical composition. If the temperature, pressure or composition of a system differs from the environment's state, then the overall system will have exergy.|$|E
25|$|In a shootout, the Bills {{jumped to}} a 20–3 {{lead in the}} first half, and kept pace with the Dolphins as the two teams matched each other score for score {{for the rest of}} the game. By the end, both teams {{finished}} even in first downs (24) and nearly even in total yards (493 for Buffalo, 430 for Miami). Ultimately, Miami's three turnovers over the Bills' two would make the <b>key</b> <b>difference.</b>|$|E
