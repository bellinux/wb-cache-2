5|$|ISAF was {{initially}} charged with securing Kabul and surrounding areas <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban,</b> al Qaeda and factional warlords, {{so as to}} allow for the establishment of the Afghan Transitional Administration headed by Hamid Karzai. In October 2003, the UN Security Council authorized the expansion of the ISAF mission throughout Afghanistan, and ISAF subsequently expanded the mission in four main stages over the whole of the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{strategic}} {{purpose of}} controlling Musa Qala is both to squeeze Taliban operations in south-western Afghanistan {{and to serve}} as a symbol of Afghan National Army and ISAF strength; the town had taken on iconic proportions, according to British officials. The Taliban, however, continue to enjoy significant civilian support despite their atrocities and the broader campaign to win over the region remains difficult. Troop shortages have made it difficult for NATO to hold areas seized <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> in southern Afghanistan.|$|E
5|$|A {{few years}} later, Laila {{gives birth to}} Zalmai, Rasheed's son. The Taliban has risen to power and imposed harsh rules on the Afghan population, prohibiting women from {{appearing}} in public without a male relative. There is a drought, and living conditions in Kabul become poor. Rasheed's workshop burns down, and he is forced to take jobs {{for which he is}} ill-suited. He sends Aziza to an orphanage. Laila endures a number of beatings <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> when caught alone on the streets in attempts to visit her daughter.|$|E
50|$|Qatar {{has hosted}} {{officials}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Afghan <b>Taliban</b> and Hamas. Qatar defends this move by {{saying it is}} trying to act as an intermediary in regional conflicts. For example, Qatar hosted talks between <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> and <b>the</b> Afghan government in 2016.|$|R
25|$|On September 26, 1996, as <b>the</b> <b>Taliban,</b> with {{military}} support by Pakistan {{and financial support}} by Saudi Arabia, prepared for another major offensive, Massoud ordered a full retreat <b>from</b> Kabul. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> seized Kabul on September 27, 1996, and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.|$|R
25|$|Shortly {{after their}} fall <b>from</b> power, <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> began an {{insurgency}} {{to regain control}} of Afghanistan. Over the next decade, ISAF and Afghan troops led many offensives against <b>the</b> <b>Taliban,</b> but failed to fully defeat them. Afghanistan remains one of the poorest countries in the world {{due to a lack of}} foreign investment, government corruption, and <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> insurgency.|$|R
5|$|Despite their injuries, the SEALs made a {{defensive}} retreat through the steep woods. Dietz begins to lose consciousness and shouts questions to Luttrell, unwittingly revealing the team's position to the Taliban. Murphy and Axelson jump off another ridge to flee <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> fighters. Luttrell tries to carry Dietz down the mountain, but Dietz is {{shot in the}} shoulder; the impact forces Luttrell to lose his grip and fall forward off the cliff. A dying Dietz remains {{at the top of}} the cliff and is killed by the Taliban insurgents. Murphy decides to try climbing back up the cliff to get a phone signal in order to call in support forces via satellite phone. Axelson and Luttrell shoot at the Taliban fighters to provide Murphy with cover. When he finally reaches higher ground, Murphy is able to alert the SEAL base of his team's location and request emergency assistance right before he is shot dead by Taliban fighters.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to Murphy's distress call, a quick reaction force team assembles, boards two CH-47 Chinook helicopters, and {{heads toward the}} location without gunship escort seeking to extract the remaining members of the reconnaissance and surveillance team. During an attempt to insert the arriving forces, the Taliban insurgents shoot {{down one of the}} helicopters, killing eight Navy SEALs and eight Special Operations aviators who were on board. The second helicopter is forced to turn back. After witnessing the attack, Luttrell and a badly injured Axelson are left behind. Axelson attempts to find cover, but is killed when he leaves his hiding spot to attack several approaching insurgents. When Luttrell is discovered by the Taliban, one of the insurgents fires a rocket-propelled grenade, and its impact causes him to land {{at the bottom of a}} rock crevice where he is able to hide <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> fighters.|$|E
5|$|On May 26, 2008, Staff Sergeant Petry and {{his unit}} {{were on a}} mission in Paktia Province, Afghanistan. He was {{assigned}} to D Company, 2nd Battalion, 75th Ranger Regiment, which was on a daylight raid to capture a high-value target <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban.</b> Petry was to locate with the platoon headquarters in the target building once it was secured. Once there, he was {{to serve as the}} senior non-commissioned officer at the site {{for the remainder of the}} operation. The team of 70 Rangers encountered about 40 Taliban, 12 of them armed. Almost immediately after getting out of the helicopters that delivered the unit to the attack site, the Rangers came under strong fire. Petry provided additional supervision to an assaulting squad during the clearance of a building, and afterward he took Private First Class Lucas Robinson to clear an outer courtyard.|$|E
50|$|Most {{of the new}} {{recruits}} were drawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> madrassas or religious schools of the tribal areas of Pakistan, <b>from</b> which <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> had originally arisen. As of 2008, the insurgency, {{in the form of}} a Taliban guerrilla war, continues.|$|R
25|$|By December 8, 2007, NATO troops {{captured}} two villages {{south of}} the town and advanced to within two kilometers <b>from</b> <b>the</b> outskirts. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> were withdrawing to their defences in the town and more Taliban reinforcements were pouring into the district. The biggest problem for the coalition were mines. Both of the two fatalities sustained by the coalition at that point were the result of land mines.|$|R
25|$|Operation Kryptonite (February 12): Some 300 British and Dutch ISAF and ANA troops cleared <b>the</b> area <b>from</b> where <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> had mortared <b>the</b> dam in {{the past}} months. On February 14, a senior Taliban leader, Mullah Manan, {{was killed in an}} airstrike between Kajaki and Musa Qala.|$|R
25|$|Hekmati {{had played}} a key role in helping Ismail Khan escape <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> in 1999.|$|E
25|$|In {{the weeks}} {{following}} Marcus Luttrell's rescue, Gulab {{and his family}} received threats <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> and they were relocated to Asadabad.|$|E
25|$|After {{declaring the}} first stage of the {{operation}} a success on 27 July 2009, UK forces commenced the second stage - which focused on holding ground won <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> in previous weeks.|$|E
25|$|According to the Wall Street Journal, Shahzad {{received}} bomb-making training <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pakistani <b>Taliban.</b> <b>The</b> Pakistani <b>Taliban</b> {{are made}} up overwhelmingly of Pashtun tribesmen. According to CBS News, Shahzad {{has been on the}} Department of Homeland Security travel lookout list since 1999 because he has been bringing in large amounts of cash (approximately $80,000) into the United States.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> started {{shelling}} Kabul {{in early}} 1995 but were defeated by {{forces of the}} Islamic State government under Ahmad Shah Massoud. Amnesty International, referring to <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> offensive, wrote in a 1995 report:The Taliban's early victories in 1994 were followed {{by a series of}} defeats that resulted in heavy losses which led analysts to believe <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> movement had run its course. At that point Pakistan and Saudi Arabia drastically increased their support to <b>the</b> <b>Taliban.</b> Many analysts like Amin Saikal describe <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> as developing into a proxy force for Pakistan's regional interests.On September 26, 1996, as <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> with military support by Pakistan and financial support by Saudi Arabia, prepared for another major offensive against the capital Kabul, Massoud ordered a full retreat <b>from</b> <b>the</b> city. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> seized Kabul on September 27, 1996, and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan.|$|R
2500|$|The UN {{agreed that}} NATO would act on its behalf, {{focusing}} on counter-terrorist operations in Afghanistan after <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> had been [...] "defeated". The United Kingdom took operational responsibility for Helmand Province, a major poppy-growing province in southern Afghanistan, deploying troops {{there in the}} summer of 2006, and encountered resistance by re-formed Taliban forces allegedly entering Afghanistan <b>from</b> Pakistan. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> turned towards <b>the</b> use of improvised explosive devices.|$|R
25|$|Operation Black Thunderstorm was an {{aggressive}} military operation that commenced on April 26, 2009 {{conducted by the}} Pakistan Army, {{with the aim of}} retaking Buner, Lower Dir, Swat and Shangla districts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> after the militants took control of them {{since the start of the}} year.|$|E
25|$|The {{operations}} aims were {{to disrupt}} Taliban {{activities in the}} Upper Gereshk Valley, between the towns of Gereshk and Sangin, and strengthen the Afghan government’s control of the Musa Qaleh Wadi. Resistance <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> was limited to indirect fire and improvised explosive devices, the Taliban avoiding direct confrontations with coalition forces.|$|E
25|$|On May 30, the Pakistani {{military}} had taken back {{the city of}} Mingora <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban,</b> calling it a significant victory in its offensive against the Taliban. However, some sporadic fighting was still continuing on the city's outskirts. Also, sporadic fighting was continuing {{in the rest of}} Swat and in the Shangla district where on June 2, two soldiers and five militants were killed.|$|E
50|$|Bacha's career {{came to a}} {{standstill}} in 2007 when he began receiving text messages and phone calls <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Pakistani <b>Taliban.</b> <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> asked him to quit music and threatened to kill him and his family. These death threats lasted approximately one year until on 14 August 2008, Bacha fled his home and went to Brooklyn, New York, where he was granted political asylum.|$|R
50|$|Spreading <b>from</b> Kandahar, <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> {{eventually}} ruled Kabul in 1996. By {{the end of}} 2000, <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> {{were able}} to rule 90% of <b>the</b> country, aside <b>from</b> <b>the</b> opposition (Northern Alliance) strongholds primarily found in {{the northeast corner of}} Badakhshan Province. Areas under the Taliban's direct control were mainly Afghanistan's major cities and highways. Tribal khans and warlords had de facto direct control over various small towns, villages, and rural areas. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> sought to impose a strict interpretation of Islamic Sharia law upon the entire country of Afghanistan.|$|R
50|$|In 2015, Rasul {{broke away}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> main <b>Taliban</b> {{leadership}} and established his own group, the High Council of Afghanistan Islamic Emirate. The split {{was a result}} of a disagreement over the ascension of Mullah Akhtar Mansour as leader of <b>the</b> <b>Taliban.</b> Rasul's followers accuse Mansour of hijacking the movement due to personal greed. Rasul says that he and his supporters tried to persuade him to step down and let the new leader be chosen by <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> council, but Mansour refused.|$|R
25|$|According to a February 2010 {{report in}} the Pakistani {{newspaper}} The News International, the Taliban threatened to execute US soldier Bowe Bergdahl, whom they had captured on 30 June 2009 in retaliation for Siddiqui's conviction. A Taliban spokesperson claimed that members of Siddiqui's family had requested help <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> to obtain her release from prison in the US. Bergdahl was released on 31 May 2014 in exchange for five Guantanamo Bay detainees.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Tora Bora in June 2017 was a {{military}} engagement for the cave complex of Tora Bora and its surroundings in Afghanistan. Fighting took place between the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant – Khorasan Province (ISIL-K) and forces opposed to it, namely the Taliban, militias formed by {{the population of the}} Pachir Aw Agam District, and the Afghan National Army. After heavy clashes ISIL-K forces initially succeeded in capturing Tora Bora <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> on 13-14 June 2017, but Afghan government forces retook the cave complex by 17 June.|$|E
25|$|However, {{several days}} later the Frontier Corps began a {{large-scale}} offensive {{under the command of}} Major-General Tariq Khan, codenamed Operation Sherdil (Lionheart), with the objective of regaining control of Bajaur <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban.</b> About 8,000 troops belonging to the FC and Army were involved, backed by Cobra attack helicopters and fighter jets that pounded Taliban holdouts. To support the Army, Pakistan Air Force responded with aggressive air campaigns. Pakistani military sources indicate that the army has been surprised by the resistance the insurgents have been putting up. The Taliban have been using advanced tactics, fighting from prepared defenses.|$|E
50|$|On November 2, 2007, Afghan {{security}} forces killed a top-ranking militant, Mawlawi Abdul Manan, {{after he was}} caught trying to cross into Afghanistan <b>from</b> neighboring Pakistan. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> confirmed his death.|$|R
50|$|Guantanamo detainee Awal Gul had worked, reluctantly, for <b>the</b> <b>Taliban,</b> in {{administrative}} positions. He told his Tribunal of making multiple attempts to resign <b>from</b> <b>the</b> positions <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> had appointed him to. When <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> {{started to fall}} he took his chance and enlisted in Hazrat Ali's forces. However, a few months later, Ali forced him to surrender himself to American forces.|$|R
50|$|On September 26, 1996, as <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> with {{military}} support by Pakistan {{and financial support}} by Saudi Arabia prepared for another major offensive, Massoud ordered a full retreat <b>from</b> Kabul. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> seized Kabul on September 27, 1996, and established the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan. The Islamic State government remained the internationally recognized government of Afghanistan. The Taliban's Islamic Emirate received recognition only from Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and the United Arab Emirates.|$|R
25|$|The Pachir Aw Agam District, where Tora Bora is located, {{was home}} to both Taliban as well as {{government}} followers, and thus quickly became a target for ISIL-K, which began to terrorize the district's population through killings, abductions, raids and looting. As result, the locals became extremely hostile and opposed to ISIL-K. On 13 April 2017, the United States bombed and largely destroyed the cave systems in Achin District that were used by ISIL-K as main base. As result, the group was deprived of its sanctuary; according to Afghan politician and former warlord Hazrat Ali, this caused ISIL-K to seek a new refuge. Probably due to its strategic location the Islamic State militants chose Tora Bora as prospective new headquarters, and moved to capture it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Taliban began {{preparing}} offensives {{against the}} remaining areas controlled by Ahmad Shah Massoud and Abdul Rashid Dostum. Massoud and Dostum, former foes, responded by allying {{to form the}} United Front (Northern Alliance) against the Taliban. In addition to the dominantly Tajik forces of Massoud and the Uzbek forces of Dostum, the United Front included Hazara factions and Pashtun forces {{under the leadership of}} commanders such as Abdul Haq or Haji Abdul Qadir. Prominent politicians of the United Front were in example diplomat and Afghan prime minister Abdul Rahim Ghafoorzai or the UF's foreign minister Abdullah Abdullah. <b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> conquest in 1996 until November 2001 the United Front controlled roughly 30% of Afghanistan's population in provinces such as Badakhshan, Kapisa, Takhar and parts of Parwan, Kunar, Nuristan, Laghman, Samangan, Kunduz, Ghōr and Bamyan.|$|E

5000|$|Around September 1994, <b>the</b> <b>Taliban</b> {{movement}} captured <b>the</b> Afghan city of Kandahar {{and began}} its long conquest with help <b>from</b> Pakistan. <b>The</b> <b>Taliban</b> {{claimed that they}} wanted to clean Afghanistan <b>from</b> <b>the</b> warlords and criminals.
