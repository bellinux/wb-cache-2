30|$|ResultsThe {{results of}} the quality {{controlled}} chemical analyses show a significant decrease of the metal bioaccumulation in Germany from 1990 to 2000 for all elements. However, in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania the concentrations of Cr and Zn are even significantly higher than those found in 1990. From 2000 to 2005 [*]a further non-significant increase can be stated for As, Cu, Ni and Ti. The concentrations of Cd and Pb decreased significantly throughout all four surveys. The MMI illustrates the temporal trend of the metal bioaccumulation as a whole: After a significant decrease from 1990 to 2000 it increased significantly till 2005. The N concentration in mosses in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania reaches from 1.3 to 2.3  % in dry mass and is negatively correlated with the <b>forest</b> <b>ratio</b> in the surroundings of the moss sampling sites and {{to the same degree}} positively correlated with the area ratio of agricultural land uses. Except for Cd, Pb and Sb all metal concentrations in the mosses are negatively correlated with the <b>forest</b> <b>ratio</b> around the sampling sites. With the exception of Cr all metal concentrations are further negatively correlated with the precipitation sums of the accumulation periods. Only the Cu and Zn concentrations show no or rather a negative correlation with the tree height whereas all other elements exhibit positive correlations. Furthermore, all elements except Cr are significantly associated to the sampled moss species, the growth pattern and the frequency of occurrence of the mosses at the respective sampling sites. Exemplified for Cu multivariate correlations were furthermore detected by CHAID. It could be shown that the frequency of the mosses, the sampled moss species, the distance to motorways and the distance to the Baltic Sea are the statistically most significant boundary conditions of the Cu concentrations in the mosses sampled in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania in 2005. No correlations were found between the modelled total depositions and the concentrations of Cd, Hg and Pb in the mosses at p <  0.1. For Pb in 1995 [*]r is 0.52 at p = 0.012, for the other surveys no correlations at p <  0.05 could be found.|$|E

40|$|The {{coupling}} between {{atmosphere and}} biosphere {{is of particular}} importance over land surfaces from both the atmospheric and hydrological point of view. For an adequate modelling of processes at the land surface boundary to the atmosphere an accurate representation of the land surface is necessary. The description of the present land surface is a significant problem in global and regional climate modelling. The available datasets are particularly inaccurate in some {{regions of the world}} and up to now their spatial resolution was too coarse to fit the demands of high resolution limited area models. Recent development in remote sensing facilitates the measurement of present land surface characteristics at a very fine spatial resolution thereby offering the possibility to create new datasets of land surface parameters for numerical modelling. At a resolution of 1 km a global distribution of major ecosystem types (according to Olson, 1994, 1994) was recently made available by the U. S. geological survey. It was derived from international geosphere biosphere programme 1 km AVHRR data. From this global distribution a global dataset of land surface parameters is constructed by allocating parameters to each ecosystem type. These parameters are: background surface albedo, surface roughness length due to vegetation, fractional vegetation cover and leaf area index for the growing and dormancy season, <b>forest</b> <b>ratio,</b> plant-available soil water holding capacity, and volumetric wilting point.

Land fragmentation is an important feature of LCLUC, however, its impact on hydrological service of tropical watershed is unclear despite a few theoretical frameworks. In this paper, we described a simulation study of eight tropical watersheds in Puerto Rico using the Soil Water Assessment Tool. Annual average stream discharge was derived according to the simulations with the land cover maps in 1977, 1991, and 2000. Annual big stream discharge with risks of flooding and severe soil erosion was computed as the sum of daily discharge greater than 95 th percentile. The impacts {{of changes in}} land cover and fragmentation represented by perimeter-to-area ratio of land patches on annual average and big discharges were further analyzed by means of the linear mixed-effects model. Most mountainous watersheds were characterized by reforestation in 1977 - 1991 but slight deforestation in 1991 - 2000. <b>Forest</b> perimeter-to-area <b>ratio</b> was significantly correlated with covers of forest (correlation coefficient of - 0. 97), pasture (0. 94), and urban (0. 95).

Land cover change plays more important roles in regulating the big discharges than altering the annual average discharges. Due to the negative correlation between forest cover and fragmentation, the decreased forest fragmentation accompanied with reforestation offsets the impact of reforestation on lessening freshwater supply and flooding risk...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows an}} example of {{substantial}} increase in carbon emissions from forest fires after reforestation on a national scale. It is the first estimation of historical carbon emissions from forest fires in Korea during the last 40 years. Investigation {{was focused on the}} recent increase in large forest fires and its closely related factors. A simple modeling approach to estimate carbon emission was applied. The direct carbon emission from forest fires in 2000, ranging from 115 to 300 Gg C, corresponds to 1 - 3 % of the annual carbon uptake by forests. The influence of forest fires on the carbon cycle in Korea is not so significant, but Korean forests have a large potential for generating severe local fires due to increasing forest carbon density and a high <b>forest</b> area <b>ratio</b> (<b>forest</b> area/total land area) of 65 %. The carbon emission per area burned (Mg C ha(- 1)) clearly reflects the trend toward increases in the number of severe fires. Statistical analyses and the trends of annual temperature and precipitation show that the recent large increase in carbon emissions may be the negative consequences of intensive forest regrowth that is the product of successful reforestation and forest management programs rather than the effect of climate change. These results imply a need for further studies in other countries, where large-scale plantation has been conducted, to evaluate the role of plantation and forest fires on the global carbon cycle. close 7...|$|R

The fully automated measuring system used for the determination of NO and NO 2 flux rates is described in detail. In addition, NO, NO 2 and N 2 O emission rates from soils of different pine forest ecosystems of Northeastern Germany (Brandenburg) were determined during 2 measuring campaigns in 1995. Mean monthly NO and N 2 O emission rates (July 1994 -June 1995) of the untreated spruce plot at the Höglwald site were {{in the range of}} 20 - 130 my g NO-N m(- 2) h(- 1) and 3. 5 - 16. 4 my g N 2 O-N m(- 2) h(- 1), respectively.

Liming of a spruce plot resulted in a reduction of NO emission rates (monthly means: 15 - 140 my g NO-N m(- 2) h(- 1)) by 25 - 30 per cent as compared to the control spruce plot. On the other hand, lim ing of a spruce plot significantly enhanced over the entire observation period N 2 O emission rates (monthly means: 6. 2 - 22. 1 my g N 2 O-N m(- 2) h(- 1)). Contrary to the spruce stand, mean monthly N 2 O emission rates from soil of the beech plot (range: 7. 9 - 102 my g N 2 O-N m(- 2) h(- 1)) were generally significantly higher than NO emission rates (range: 6. 1 - 47. 0 my g NO-N m(- 2) h(- 1)). Results obtained from measuring campaigns in three different pine forest ecosystems revealed mean N 2 O emission rates between 6. 0 and 53. 0 my g N 2 O-N m(- 2) h(- 1) and mean NO emission rates between 2. 6 and 3 1. 1 my g NO-N m(- 2) h(- 1).

This study investigated the effects of water and nitrogen availability on Douglas-fir growth throughout the region. Sixty Douglas-fir plots were established from Vancouver Island, BC to southern Oregon. Biogeoclimatic properties and fertilizer response were investigated according to soil nutrient regimes (SNRs) and soil parent materials alone (SPMs) and split by state and province (RSPMs). The effects of climate, site, and soil properties were investigated on soil water, soil nitrogen (N), and foliar variables using boosted regression trees and generalized additive models. Soil water availability was affected by soil depth and texture and influenced total soil N content and needle area. Sedimentary SPMs and very rich SNRs were identified as the most productive due to fine textured soils with greater water and N availabilities, which resulted in greater site index values and low fertilizer response. Glacial SPMs and medium SNRs had the lowest soil productivity due to coarse-textured soils with low water and N contents. Height:DBH ratio was greatest on stands with glacial SPMs yielding greater than expected site index values. Low spring temperatures and low water availability led to high <b>forest</b> floor C:N <b>ratios,</b> which then led to lower foliar nitrogen concentrations. <b>Forest</b> floor C:N <b>ratios</b> and fertilizer response were higher on igneous SPMs and British Columbia glacial RSPMs. These studies highlighted the effects of soil water and N availability on Douglas-fir growth and fertilizer response throughout the region...|$|R

These results suggest that forest structural characteristics, such as canopy openness and seasonal forest-floor changes, should be considered during continuous observations of phenology in evergreen coniferous forests. 　林冠が疎なアラスカと,林冠が閉じた日本の常緑針葉樹林を対象に,生物季節（フェノロジー）画像から抽出した指数と渦相関法観測に基づいた総生産量（GPP）の季節変化の対応関係を調査した. 両森林ともに,フェノロジー画像から抽出した緑の成分や色相と,GPPはベル型の季節変化パターンを示した. フェノロジー画像は主に,アラスカでは林床の植生の,日本では林冠表面の季節変化を捉えた. 一方,赤や青の成分の季節変化パターンには,生態系の構造や葉の色の違いに起因した差がみられた。これらの結果は、常緑針葉樹林の長期連続的なフェノロジー観測には、林冠の鬱閉の程度や、林床植生の季節変化等を考慮することの重要性を示唆した...|$|R
40|$|A 2 year {{cross-sectional}} {{study was conducted}} to evaluate the occurrence of feral and wild cats and the risk of Toxoplasma gondii infection in terrestrial wildlife in a natural area in Piatt County, Illinois. Cats are the definitive host for T. gondii and are a key component of rural and urban transmission of T. gondii to humans, livestock, pets, and wildlife. I selected 4 forest sites within the interior of the park and 4 edge sites within 300 m of human buildings. Feline and wildlife occurrence in the natural area was determined using scent stations, motion detection cameras, and overnight live trapping. Amount of cat habitat use was classified based on frequency of cat occurrence. Prevalence of T. gondii antibodies was determined using the indirect immunofluorescent antibody test (IFAT) and a positive titer of 1 : 25. Wildlife species were classified as having a large home range (LHR) or a small home range (SHR), based on published home range estimates and using a cutoff of 100 hectares. A total of 18 feral cats (16 at building and 2 at forest sites) were trapped with an overall seroprevalence of 33 %; only one of the T. gondii positive cats was trapped in the forest. Feral cats were trapped 8 times more often at building sites (Ratio = 8; P = 0. 083), and detected by scent stations 3 times more often at building sites compared to <b>forest</b> sites (<b>Ratio</b> = 3. 2; P = 0. 010). More LHR mammals were trapped at building versus <b>forest</b> sites (<b>Ratio</b> = 2. 9; P < 0. 001), while SHR mammals were trapped at similar abundances at building and forest sites. Sites with a higher frequency of cat occurrence, defined as ??? 9 cat occurrences across three detection methods, exhibited a higher T. gondii seroprevalence in SHR mammals (OR= 4. 2; P= 0. 018), although {{there was no significant difference}} when comparing seroprevalence at forest versus building sites in SHR or LHR mammals. Toxoplasma gondii antibodies were detected in wildlife at all sites and my findings point to the presence of feral cats as the source of environmental contamination. Although environmental contamination with oocysts of the parasite was not assessed, SHR mammals are good indicators of localized environmental contamination with oocysts at small spatial scales. Due to their greater spatial use and omnivorous diet, LHR mammals are good indicators of large spatial scale environmental contamination and intermediate host infection in a natural area. Multiple strategies to measure cat occurrence are important to evaluate risk for disease transmission compared to using live trapping of cats only, as feral cats in my study showed evidence of being trap shy, although they were detected in the park by other indirect methods. This study improves my understanding of ecological drivers behind spatial variation of T. gondii occurrence within a natural area...|$|R
40|$|Initial {{results of}} a pilot study to link remotely-sensedinformation on {{tropical}} forest loss to field-based infor- mation on species endangerment are reported here. LANDSAT multispectral scanner (MSS) imagery from 1973 and 1988 were used to estimate net forest removal (29 % of forest area), regrowth (7 % of forest area, including possible artifactual errors), and forest edges in Mabira Forest in southeastern Uganda during the 15 -year period. Of the forest remaining, the percentage that was heavily disturbed increased from 18 % to 42 %. This change in forest density was observable with the MSS imagery. The total <b>forest</b> edge-to-area <b>ratio</b> (including edges interior to the forest boundary) increased by 29 % over the period. Although four distinct types of closed tropical forest, based on structure or dominance, could be recognizedonthe ground, the types could not be distinguished by differences in spectral reflectance in the four MSS bands. Closed tropical forest could be readily distinguished from exotic conifer plantations, banana plantations, and other non-forest vegetation types. Field measurements in Mabira and other Ugandan rain forests, and in rain forest isolates on the Atherton Tableland of North Queensland, are being made to relate changes in forest fragmentation to resulting changes in species abundance, structural form of the forests, and morphological diversity of tar- get populations. Possible applications of conservation biology theory and modeling to these data are briefly discussed...|$|R
40|$|Urban forest {{remnants}} are {{a useful}} tool to study forest response to global change with urbanization. Soil nutrient status in urban forests has not been well understood, especially {{under the pressure of}} rapid urbanization in developing countries. In this study, ion-exchange resin bags and a modified Hedley P fractionation procedure were used to measure seasonal dynamics of soil N forms (ammonium and nitrate) and P fractions (available, labile, slow, occlude and weathered mineral P) under urban forest remnants across a successional sequence and non-forest land in the city of Nanchang, Southern China. Results showed that soil N availability varied with season and vegetation community (P < 0. 05). Soil P fractions showed minimal seasonal variation except available P, while their averages generally increased with forest development from non-forest land to coniferous forest to conifer-broadleaf mixed forest to evergreen broad-leaved <b>forest.</b> The <b>ratios</b> of fresh soil N forms to P fractions generally decreased with forest development, while N forms absorbed by resins to P fractions generally increased from non-forest land to coniferous forest, then decreased from conifer-broadleaf mixed forest to evergreen broad-leaved forest. It is suggested that urban older forest remnants could easily move to N saturation status and soil P enrichment, causing urban water pollution due to the accumulative effect of elevated atmospheric N deposition and exogenous P input with urbanization.

40|$|Nitrate leakage from {{deciduous}} forest soils into streams was investigated for two adjacent hills. Many of the streams on Kureha Hill, located in Toyama City, Japan, have extremely high nitrate concentrations. The nitrate concentration of Hyakumakidani, {{one of the}} streams on Kureha Hill, averaged 158 μeq l- 1 and reached 470 μeq l- 1 during an episodic event. In contrast, the streams on Imizu Hill, adjacent to Kureha Hill, had low concentrations, below 15 μeq l- 1. Even during an episode, the nitrate concentrations increased {{to no more than}} 75 μeq l- 1. Both areas have similar blown <b>forest</b> soils, C/N <b>ratios</b> in O horizons, and vegetation consisting primarily of deciduous trees. However, soil incubation experiments, which lasted for 4 weeks, revealed that the nitrification rates in the surface soils of Kureha Hill were much higher than in the soils of Imizu Hill...|$|R
