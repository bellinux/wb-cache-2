Initial assessment for the majority of wastes follows a simple derivation of industry (some 20 main categories) from which they were originally obtained (Agricultural, wood working (furniture), Electronics, etc. [...] ). Each Derived section (denoted by the first 2 sets of 2 numbers refers to a particular industry or sector). The final set of 2 numbers relates directly to the waste.

The particular and complex nature {{of the mixture of}} the volatile substances, its variability in time and the strong influence of the atmospheric conditions, are the elements that delayed their regulation and relative management. Limited data are available in the technical and scientific literature, regarding the odour emissions characterization from liquid waste treatment plants. Moreover there isn’t a common strategy from the different European Countries in the regulation of their emissions. Different methods can be used to measure odour {{emissions from}} environmental engineering plants, and currently, in Europe, the most used techniques for odour emissions characterization and quantification is the dynamic olfactometry, according to EN 13725 : 2003. The aim of this study is the characterization of the odour emissions from different liquid waste treatment plants (LWTPs), trough a case study of two large real LWTPs, in order to identify the principal odour sources and to define their related odour emissions. Concentration Index (CI) is proposed as a useful and simply odour management tool for the identification of the priority actions necessary to identify and control the main odorous sources. Relationship between the measured odour emissions and the types of treated liquid waste is also discussed. Results shown that the influent collection tank is the source with the highest detected odours emissions. CI results are useful for the definition of a clear priority action for odour control, similar for both investigated plants. Between the characterized types of liquid waste treated by LWTPs the leachate (<b>EWC</b> 190703 <b>code)</b> show the maximum odour emissions...|$|R
40|$|The Alzheimer's Disease Life Events study {{examines}} {{whether there is}} a relationship between life events and Alzheimer's disease (AD). The ADLE study uses a mixed methods approach to answer the central research question:Are life events a risk factor for Alzheimer's disease? The central research question uses the following theory questions to examine: 1. Is there a difference between the number of life events between patients and controls, using the Life Events and Difficulties Schedule (LEDS) (Brown and Harris, 1978) as a measurement tool? 2. Is there a difference in the way (i. e. positive, neutral and negative) life events are discussed and in the range of emotions expressed when discussing life events between the patients and controls? 3. Are there any differences in the narrative constructions of life events, as interpreted by the Biographic Narrative Interpretive Method (BNIM) (Wengraf, 2001, 2008) between the patient and control groups? 4. Can the differences, between the patient and control groups, in the narratives be developed into a diagnostic marker? 5. Can the Emotion Word <b>Coding</b> (<b>EWC)</b> (Danner et aI., 2000) be used as a diagnostic marker by being applied to text collected from patients and controls over a period of decades? The ADLE study found that the patient group had experienced more life events in comparison with the control group as defined by the LEOS (Brown and Harris, 1978), and that the patient group had experienced more bereavements under the age of 51 years. The evidence supports the association between life events and AD. Even though there were significantly more life events experienced by the patients, the EWC (Danner et aI., 2001) found significantly fewer discussions expressing emotion bythe patients, particularly the negatively described ones. The range of negative and positive words used to describe the life events was significantly fewer too. This implies that the ways the patients express emotions about life events is substantially different from the controls. This finding was mirrored in the thematic field analysis of the BNIM interviews (Wengraf, 2001, 2008), which found differences in the content and structure of the narratives, and the emotional expression in the narratives about life events. A tool has been constructed using the differences between patients and controls to contribute to the early diagnosis of AD. In addition, the ADLE study has contributed to a gap in the knowledge about life events and AD. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Waste {{combustion}} {{is associated}} with the generation of post-processing solid products – waste such as slag and ash. One of the promising technologies in waste management and processing is the synthesis of zeolites and other materials exhibiting sorption properties. The aim {{of this study was to}} characterise and assess the physicochemical properties of the waste and the products synthesised from it. This paper presents the possibility of synthesis zeolites from the slag and ash from two waste combustion plants. The investigated waste is classified as hazardous waste and denoted by the <b>EWC</b> <b>code</b> 190111 *. The paper presents the results of physicochemical studies of these materials. As a result of synthesis in an autoclave at 140 °C with the use of 2 M NaOH, and other compounds, such zeolite forms as chabazite and sodalite were obtained. Textural studies and ion-exchange capacity investigations carried out allowed characterisation of the sorption properties of the materials. It was found that the materials obtained are characterised by the BET specific surface areas of 25. 45 m 2 /g and 16. 79 m 2 /g...|$|E
