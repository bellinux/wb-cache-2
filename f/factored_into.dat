5|$|The GCD of two numbers a and b is {{the product}} of the prime factors shared by the two numbers, where a same prime factor can be used {{multiple}} times, but only as long as the product of these factors divides both a and b. For example, since 1386 can be <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> 2×3×3×7×11, and 3213 can be <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> 3×3×3×7×17, the greatest common divisor of 1386 and 3213 equals 63=3×3×7, the product of their shared prime factors. If two numbers have no prime factors in common, their greatest common divisor is 1 (obtained here as an instance of the empty product), in other words they are coprime. A key advantage of the Euclidean algorithm is that it can find the GCD efficiently without having to compute the prime factors. Factorization of large integers is believed to be a computationally very difficult problem, and the security of many widely used cryptographic protocols is based upon its infeasibility.|$|E
5|$|Turner {{graduated}} from the University of Maryland in May 2009 with a bachelor's degree in government and politics. His strong interest in politics <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> his decision on where to attend college. He chose the University of Maryland partly based on its close proximity to Washington, D.C. Turner's political views are liberal; he is registered as a Democrat, and has described himself as an idealist.|$|E
5|$|Paleoenvironmental {{evidence}} shows that between the 9th and 11th centuries the area around Buckton Castle was cleared of woodland. This left little timber, and may have <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> the use of stone as a building material. The earliest castles in England typically used timber, at least {{when they were first}} built, and building in stone was more expensive than earth and timber. It became more common to use stone in 12th-century castles, and Buckton is amongst the earliest masonry castles in North West England.|$|E

5|$|That season, an {{economic}} recession <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> the selections. In general, bowl officials attempted to select teams in close geographic proximity {{to compensate for}} an anticipated drop in ticket sales. Maryland, however, stated {{that they would not}} accept a berth to face in-state rival Navy in the nearby EagleBank Bowl due to a conflict with the school's final exams. The Emerald Bowl was not seen as a viable choice due to Maryland's participation in it the year prior.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} universal acclaim from critics, who praised its {{artistic design}} and overall game direction in particular. Grim Fandango {{was selected for}} several gaming awards {{at the time of}} release, and is often listed {{as one of the greatest}} video games of all time. However, the game was considered a commercial failure and <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> LucasArts' termination of their adventure game development, contributing to the decline of the adventure game genre.|$|E
5|$|The trams are {{electrically}} powered from 750 V DC overhead lines. Between 1992 and 2007, electricity for the Metrolink system was procured by the operator, based on price only. In 2007, GMPTE changed the contractual requirements {{to ensure that}} sustainable power would be <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> choosing an energy supplier, and in July 2007, Metrolink became the first light rail network in the UK with electricity supplied entirely from sustainable energy via hydropower. Now, energy for the system is generated by biomass.|$|E

5|$|Wind shear affects sailboats {{in motion}} by {{presenting}} a different wind speed and direction at different heights along the mast. The effect of low level wind shear can be <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> {{the selection of}} sail twist in the sail design, but this {{can be difficult to}} predict since wind shear may vary widely in different weather conditions. Sailors may also adjust the trim of the sail to account for low level wind shear, for example using a boom vang.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge {{was inaugurated}} as {{president}} of Jefferson College on September 27, 1845. During his tenure, he also pastored a church {{in the city of}} Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. College administration apparently did not suit him, however. A student uprising against the president and the faculty occurred in 1846, hastening the end of his short stay at the school. A desire to see his children, most of whom were living with relatives scattered throughout Kentucky and Virginia, also <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> his decision to resign his post in 1847. On his resignation, he was awarded an honorary LL.D from the school.|$|E
5|$|During construction, {{the need}} for new water and {{electrical}} supply lines arose. Because these were not <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> the original $65million cost, another $5million was appropriated from existing capital funds. Another $5million was later required to pay for cleaning contaminated soil, increased sub-contractor pricing, additional labor costs incurred by delays caused by snow and ice, and upgrades including the guitar-shaped scoreboard. The Sounds ownership team contributed $2million toward the cost of the scoreboard. These and other additional expenditures, such as a $9.5million greenway, $5.6million for street paving, sidewalks, and electrical work, and $3.6million in flood prevention, brought the total construction cost of the stadium to $56million and the total cost of the project to $91million.|$|E

5|$|European {{visitors}} in 1667 reported the Sihanaka lived in fortified villages, which they very effectively defended with bows and arrows. They {{were the only}} ethnic group encountered by the European party that had built a bridge. Homes were made of plant material; the Sihanaka believed building homes in brick or clay would invite the displeasure of the ancestors. Gendered roles <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> house construction and maintenance: men applied carpentry to build {{the frame of the}} house and roof, as well as the windows and doors and their frames, while women wove zozoro reed mats that would serve as walls, flooring and roofing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} 20 {{years of the}} BAA/NBA, the league {{was still trying to}} gain the support of fans who lived in or near the teams' home markets. To achieve this, the league {{introduced}} the territorial pick rule to help teams acquire popular players from colleges in their area who would presumably have strong local support. Before the draft, a team could forfeit its first-round draft pick and then select any player from within a 50-mile radius of its home arena. Although the territorial picks were selected before the draft, these picks were not <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> the overall selection count of the draft; therefore, the first non-territorial pick of the draft was considered the first overall pick.|$|E
5|$|On January 6, 1945, Norstad visited Hansell’s {{headquarters}} and abruptly relieved him of command, replacing him with LeMay. Hansell {{was offered the}} option of commanding XX Bomber Command while it transitioned to Guam, then becoming LeMay’s deputy. Although he and LeMay were friends, LeMay had been Hansell’s subordinate in England, and Hansell declined the offer. While all the command problems <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> his relief, the main reasons were Hansell’s persistence in daylight precision attacks, reluctance to night firebombing, Norstad's view that Hansell was an impediment to instituting incendiary attacks, and a perception by Arnold and Norstad that the public relations effort by XXI Bomber Command had been unsatisfactory in preparing the American public for such attacks.|$|E

5|$|Subsequent {{analyses}} {{called the}} original landing zone estimate into question: Scott, who was flying the aircraft manually because of Cooper's speed and altitude demands, later determined that his flight path was significantly farther east than initially assumed. Additional {{data from a}} variety of sources—in particular Continental Airlines pilot Tom Bohan, who was flying four minutes behind Flight 305—indicated that the wind direction <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> drop zone calculations had been wrong, possibly by as much as 80 degrees. This and other supplemental data suggested that the actual drop zone was probably south-southeast of the original estimate, in the drainage area of the Washougal River.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{initiatives}} {{are working to}} reduce costs of electric power from offshore wind. One example is the Carbon Trust Offshore Wind Accelerator, a joint industry project, involving nine offshore wind developers, which aims {{to reduce the cost}} of offshore wind by 10% by 2015. It has been suggested that innovation at scale could deliver 25% cost reduction in offshore wind by 2020. Henrik Stiesdal, former Chief Technical Officer at Siemens Wind Power, has stated that by 2025 energy from offshore wind {{will be one of the}} cheapest, scalable solutions in the UK, compared to other renewables and fossil fuel energy sources, if the true cost to society is <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> the cost of energy equation. He calculates the cost at that time to be 43 EUR/MWh for onshore, and 72 EUR/MWh for offshore wind.|$|E
5|$|Any {{one-dimensional}} reversible {{cellular automaton}} may be placed into rectangular form, after which its transition rule may be <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> {{the action of}} an idempotent semicentral bigroupoid (a reversible rule for which regions of cells with a single state value change only at their boundaries) together with a permutation {{on the set of}} states. The first-order invariants for the idempotent lifting of the automaton rule (the modified rule formed by omitting the permutation) necessarily behave like the ones for a rectangular band: they have a basis of invariants that flow either leftwards or rightwards at a constant rate without interaction. The first-order invariants for the overall automaton are then exactly the invariants for the idempotent lifting that give equal weight to every pair of states that belong to the same orbit of the permutation. However, the permutation of states in the rule may cause these invariants to behave differently from in the idempotent lifting, flowing non-uniformly and with interactions.|$|E

5|$|As {{the signal}} {{passes through the}} satellite, it is {{translated}} by—added to—a signal generated by an oscillator in the satellite. Although the oscillator is housed in a temperature-controlled enclosure, it is subjected to thermal variation throughout the day that results in minor changes {{in the frequency of}} the translation signal. The thermal variation results from the rotation of the satellite relative to the sun over a given 24-hour period, including the time the satellite passes through the Earth's shadow (which affected the 3:40 and 4:26 handshakes), and is complicated by the use of heaters that run when the oscillator temperature exits pre-determined limits. The variation in the translation frequency was calculated over several days, including the day of Flight 370's disappearance, and could be <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> the BFO measurement.|$|E
5|$|Despite Leopold not {{formally}} excluding Barbarigo, a rumour spread {{that he had}} been excluded, and despite the protests of the zelanti faction of cardinals, enough members of the College of Cardinals recognized the Emperor's ability to exclude a candidate that it prevented his election. Leopold had sent an envoy with two letters for his cardinals: the first public letter declared that he did not wish to see Barbarigo excluded, while the second letter, which was private, expressed his desire that Barbarigo not be elected, but {{that he did not want}} to take the blame for the exclusion, but rather wished for the Spanish to be the ones to do so. Additionally, some of the more materialistic cardinals feared that Barbarigo would be similarly strict as Pope Innocent XI, and this <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> his failure to win election.|$|E
5|$|On July 1, 2010, Hamhuis {{became an}} {{unrestricted}} free agent {{and signed a}} six-year, $27 million contract with the Vancouver Canucks. Growing up in Smithers, British Columbia, he was specifically interested in signing with the Canucks during his pending free agency, which <b>factored</b> <b>into</b> his decision to sign with neither Philadelphia nor Pittsburgh. The Canucks had reportedly tried to acquire Hamhuis previously at the 2009–10 trade deadline, with Nashville asking for prospect Cody Hodgson and a first-round draft pick in exchange. Several days prior to his free agency, the Canucks traded for defenceman Keith Ballard from the Florida Panthers, which initially led Hamhuis to believe the Canucks would be no longer interested in him. However, on July 1, the Canucks were one of ten teams to offer him a contract and he signed with the club despite more lucrative deals of up to $5 million in salary and terms of seven years.|$|E
