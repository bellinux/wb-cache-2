Webber stated that he enjoyed {{the first part of the}} event and was looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> race of the season. Kovalainen was issued with an reprimand for his role in the collision with de la Rosa. He admitted that he was at fault for causing the incident because he was allowing another car to pass him and had not seen de la Rosa approaching him. Force India's chief operating officer Otmar Szafnauer said the confusion resulting in the error of fitting the wrong tyres for both their drivers was an example of cause and effect. He wanted to disregard the issue and look <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> few races. The team received a warning from the stewards and avoided disqualification because they had recognised their mistake immediately.|$|E

Sailing with his son Sesario Sewralur, and Nainoa as sailing master, Mau watched as Nainoa's {{students}} Kaʻau McKenney and Keahi Omai served as navigators. Mau had seen Nainoa succeed in the 1980 and 19851987 voyages; finally, in this 1995 voyage, Mau saw proof that the knowledge was carried <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> generation. The canoe landed successfully at Rarotonga, and the voyage resulted in the lifting of a six-centuries-old taboo on voyaging from Ra‘iātea. Hōkūle‘a had sailed from Hawaii with sisterships Hawaiiloa and Makalii; the canoes rendez-voused at Taputapuatea with other voyaging canoes from across Oceania.|$|E

5|$|Until 1760 {{the monarch}} met all {{official}} expenses from hereditary revenues, {{which included the}} profits of the Crown Estate (the royal property portfolio). King George III agreed to surrender the hereditary revenues of the Crown {{in return for the}} Civil List, and this arrangement persisted until 2012. An annual Property Services Grant-in-aid paid for the upkeep of the royal residences, and an annual Royal Travel Grant-in-Aid paid for travel. The Civil List covered most expenses, including those for staffing, state visits, public engagements, and official entertainment. Its size was fixed by Parliament every 10 years; any money saved was carried <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> 10-year period. From 2012 until 2020, the Civil List and Grants-in-Aid are to be replaced with a single Sovereign Grant, which will be set at 15% of the revenues generated by the Crown Estate.|$|E
25|$|Moore's {{law is the}} {{observation}} {{that the number of}} transistors in a dense integrated circuit doubles approximately every two years. The observation is named after Gordon Moore, the co-founder of Fairchild Semiconductor and Intel, whose 1965 paper described a doubling every year in the number of components per integrated circuit, and projected this rate of growth would continue for at least another decade. In 1975, looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> decade, he revised the forecast to doubling every two years. The period is often quoted as 18 months because of Intel executive David House, who predicted that chip performance would double every 18 months (being a combination of the effect of more transistors and the transistors being faster).|$|E
25|$|This {{sophisticated}} form of hazing {{was played}} out {{each year in}} September. This elaborate hoax often gained the cooperation of faculty members {{and people in the}} town. During Freshman Week, the first-year students were informed about several student romances on campus through planned gossip. The story went that there was one ardent couple who were constantly together when not in class, but the girl had another upperclassman admirer. The couple argued over the love triangle and it ended in the girl walking off with her new boy. After that, there were public acts that involved the two boys fighting. The affair was all anyone would talk about. Then on a certain pre-arranged night, all freshmen were ordered to stay in their rooms by student governing bodies. At 10 pm, a drunk ex-boyfriend appeared at the men's dorm. He brandished a gun and staggered through the halls in search of his rival. He finally found him in one of the public archways of the building. Soon, several shots rang out and the victim fell to the floor with blood (ketchup) flowing from his mouth. Other upperclassmen took charge, sending confused and panicked freshmen in pursuit of the killer or for a doctor. A town physician would appear and call for an ambulance, only adding to the theatrics of the evening. Most other freshmen were rounded up and sent in groups to nearby hospitals to offer their blood for transfusion, but were left stranded. At the same time, the freshmen girls witnessed the girl in the triangle see the unconscious victim being taken away and go into a fit of hysterics. During the 1930s, a member of the staff was a Justice of the Peace. He presided over a fake hearing in a large classroom where freshman girls tearfully testified to what they thought they saw happen on campus that night. It was during that hearing that the truth was revealed when the three main actors walked into the room, arm in arm. The next day, the freshmen felt young and foolish, but were looking <b>forward</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>next</b> year when they were able to play the same prank on new freshmen. The tradition died in 1946, when its last performance narrowly escaped tragedy when some ex-servicemen studying at LVC under the G.I. Bill threatened {{to take care of the}} villain causing trouble between the lovers.|$|E

Coulthard believed he made the right decision to compete in the Grand Prix despite his injuries and that the result was [...] "the best thing that could have happened for the team and myself." [...] He also said he was looking forward to resting over the coming days to allow his injuries to heal. Barrichello admitted that the race had not been good for him until his overtake on Michael Schumacher and Ralf Schumacher and said the absence of Stepney caused his second pit stop to be slower than usual.|$|E

It's a combination of things, and of course, Walter's scattered ramblings about whatever strikes him at any particular moment." [...] Less impressed was Noel Murray of The Onions A. V. Club, who gave the episode a grade of C+. Murray wrote, [...] "'The Arrival' was the weirdest episode of Fringe yet–a deep-down sci-fi spookfest that minimized the show's procedural side and instead raised far more questions than it answered. In fact, I can't think of any questions that [...] "The Arrival" [...] satisfactorily answered–not even 'What happened in the Fringe episode entitled 'The Arrival'?'... The shock and awe factor of [...] "The Arrival" [...] was strong, but as a piece of storytelling, the episode felt slight and soggy, and hardly the satisfying standalone experience that the creators promised each Fringe chapter would be." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2008, it was {{announced}} that Aguilera would release a greatest hits album titled Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits, whose distribution rights in the United States belonged to Target retailer via her record label RCA Records.

Released in November 2008, Keeps Gettin' Better: A Decade of Hits features all of Aguilera's hits from her previous studio albums released up to 2008 and four new songs produced by Linda Perry. Two of which are remakes of her previous singles, [...] "Genie 2.0" [...] ("Genie in a Bottle"), and [...] "You Are What You Are (Beautiful)" [...] ("Beautiful"). The other new songs were [...] "Keeps Gettin' Better" [...] and [...] "Dynamite".

Bird was disappointed with the result, saying it was beneficial if the technical problems with his second at the pit stop were diagnosed in the season's first race rather than later on. His teammate López thanked the sport's fans for voting him to receive the Fan Boost and was upbeat despite retiring from his maiden ePrix: [...] "The car is fast and I think qualifying proved that. I’m sure the end result will be much, much better in Marrakech." [...] Vergne told the press that he lost the chance to achieve a strong result in the race when his car developed problems with his car's water pump and described the event as [...] "a big mess" [...] but felt certain that he could secure the championship.|$|E
