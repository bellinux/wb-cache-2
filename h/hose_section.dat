500|$|Hard {{suction hose}} {{may also be}} used to connect a fire engine to a hydrant. [...] This {{practice}} is common in Australia, but woven jacket fire hose is normally used for this purpose in the United States. [...] Using hard suction hose in this manner requires that the fire engine be positioned carefully for the limited flexibility of the hose, and may require multiple firefighters due to the weight and bulk of the <b>hose</b> <b>section.</b> In certain circumstances, {{it may be possible to}} use hard suction hose to draft from a hydrant with adequate water supply but a low flow rate.|$|E
40|$|Modeling of wave {{propagation}} in hoses, unlike in rigid pipes or waveguides, introduces a coupling between the inside medium, the hose wall, {{and the outside}} medium, This alters the axial wave number and thence the corresponding effective speed of sound inside the hose resulting in sound radiation into the outside medium, also called the breakout or shell noise, The existing literature on the subject is such that a hose cannot be integrated into the,whole piping system made up of sections of hoses, pipes, and mufflers to predict the acoustical performance in terms of transmission loss (TL), The present paper seeks to fill this gap, Three one-dimensional coupled wave equations are written {{to account for the}} presence of a yielding wall with a finite lumped transverse impedance of the hose material, The resulting wave equation can readily be reduced to a transfer matrix form using an effective wave number for a moving medium in a <b>hose</b> <b>section,</b> Incorporating the effect of fluid loading due to the outside medium also allows prediction of the transverse TL and the breakout noise, Axial TL and transverse TL have been combined into net TL needed by designers, Predictions of the axial as well as transverse TL are shown to compare well with those of a rigorous 3 -D analysis using only one-hundredth of the computation time, Finally, results of some parametric studies are reported for engineers involved in the acoustical design of hoses.

500|$|It uses suction gaskets. [...] Gaskets in {{standard}} fire hose ("pressure gaskets") {{are designed to}} minimize the water leaking out between couplings. [...] The gaskets connecting hard suction <b>hose</b> <b>sections,</b> pump, and strainer must instead prevent air from entering at the coupling, since that would spoil the vacuum and allow air into the pump intake. Large diameter ( [...] or greater) hard suction hose will typically use Storz fittings, which are genderless. [...] or smaller hard suction hose will typically use threaded fittings. [...] In each case, the hard suction hose connection will match the fittings of the pump intake and supply hose, so that hard suction hose {{can be used in}} place of supply hose as appropriate.|$|R
50|$|The {{traditional}} {{solution is}} to use metal pipes to transfer water but these are costly to deliver and assemble. Thermoplastic polyurethane (TPU) covered hoses and Nitrile rubber (NBR) covered hoses {{have a lot of}} advantages compared to metal pipes. It is easy to deliver, assemble and disassemble <b>hoses</b> and long <b>sections</b> of NBR- and TPU-covered hoses reduce the possibility of leakage in connecting parts. These large-diameter NBR- and TPU-covered hoses are called fracking hoses.|$|R
