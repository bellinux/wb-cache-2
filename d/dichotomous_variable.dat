50|$|Fractional models are, to some extent, {{related to}} binary {{response}} models. However, instead of estimating {{the probability of}} being in one bin of a <b>dichotomous</b> <b>variable,</b> the fractional model typically deals with variables that take on all possible values in the unit interval. One can easily generalize this model to take on values on any other interval by appropriate transformations. Examples range from participation rates in 401(k) plans to television ratings of NBA games.|$|E
50|$|Analysis of {{dependent}} {{dummy variable}} models {{can be done}} through different methods. One such method is the usual OLS method, which {{in this context is}} called the linear probability model. An alternative method is to assume that there is an unobservable continuous latent variable Y* and that the observed <b>dichotomous</b> <b>variable</b> Y = 1 if Y* > 0, 0 otherwise. This is the underlying concept of the logit and probit models. These models are discussed in brief below.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} better specify the multivariate {{structure}} in the data of the charcoal kiln sites, we conducted a principal component analysis (PCA; cf. Venables and Ripley 2002). For this purpose, the nominal variables “water supply status”, “nutrient supply status”, “soil complex classes”, “exposition”, and “main tree species” were transformed into <b>dichotomous</b> <b>variables</b> {{with regard to the}} respective factor levels. Only <b>dichotomous</b> <b>variables</b> were used for further analysis. In order to fit the <b>dichotomous</b> <b>variables</b> of both studied forest areas onto the PCA plot, we used the function “envfit” provided by the “vegan” package in R (Oksanen et al. 2012). A biplot was created, which allowed for the analysis of the correlation between the different variables and both forest areas.|$|R

40|$|A <b>dichotomous</b> {{dependent}} <b>variable</b> is used {{to determine}} a combination of variables that will predict group membership. <b>Dichotomous</b> <b>variables</b> are frequently encountered in multiple regression analysis.

A Chi-square {{was used to}} test the relationship between <b>dichotomous</b> <b>variables.</b> When significant, the odds ratio and its 95 % confidence interval [OR (95 % CI)] were calculated. Adjusted ORs (ORa) and 95 % CI for subject, hour and age were also calculated. Dependence between quantitative variables was checked using a Pearson correlation test (r ≥  0.6, p <  0.05). Dependence between quantitative and qualitative variables was tested using an analysis of variance (ANOVA). A logistic regression was performed to estimate the probability for binary outcome (arousal, waking and sleep stage transitions) with noise level. A value of p <  0.05 for the Wald criterion was considered to denote regression coefficients significantly different from zero. The results are shown as ORs with 95 % CIs. The fit of the models was judged using the Likelihood Ratio Test Statistic. Non-binary (more than 2 categories) <b>dichotomous</b> <b>variables</b> were analyzed using multinomial logistic regression models whereby noise level and hour were entered to predict awake and sleep stage.|$|R
