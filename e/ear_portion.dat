40|$|Magnesium is {{the lightest}} metal {{that can be}} used for {{structural}} applications. For the reasons of weight saving, there has been an increasing demand for magnesium from the automotive industry. However, poor formability at room temperature, due to a limited number of slip systems available owing to its hexagonal close packed crystal structure, imposes severe limitations on the application of Mg and its alloys in the wrought form. One possibility for improving formability is to form the components superplastically. For this, it is necessary to refine the grain structure. A fine-grained material is also stronger than its coarse grain counterpart because of grain size strengthening. Moreover, fine-grained magnesium alloys have better ductility as well as a low ductile to brittle transition temperature, thus their formability at room temperature could be improved. In addition to grain refinement, the issues pertaining to poor formability or limited ductility of Mg alloys can be addressed by controlling the crystallographic texture. Recently, it has been shown that warm equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) of magnesium led to reduction in average grain size and shear texture formation, by virtue of which subsequent room temperature rolling was possible. Based on the literature, it was also certain that, in order to make magnesium alloys amenable for processing, grain refinement needs to be carried out and the role of shear texture needs to be explored. Since processing at higher temperature would lead to relatively coarser grain size, large strain deformation at lower temperatures is desirable. The present thesis is an attempt to address these issues. The thesis has been divided in to eight chapters. The chapters 1 and 2 are dedicated to introduction and literature review on the subject that provides the foundation and motivation to the present work. Subsequent chapters deal with the research methodology, experimental and simulation results, discussion, summary and conclusion. In the present investigation, two single phase alloys were chosen, the commercially pure magnesium and the magnesium alloy AM 30. These materials were subjected to suitable processing techniques, detailed posteriori. A systematic analysis of microstructure and texture for each of the as-processed materials was performed by electron backscattered diffraction (EBSD) using a field emission gun scanning electron microscope (FEG-SEM). Bulk texture measurement by X-ray diffraction, neutron diffraction and local texture measurement by synchrotron X-rays were also carried out. In addition, dislocation density was measured using X-Ray diffraction line profile analysis (XRDLPA). The experimental textures were validated by using Visco-Plastic Self Consistent (VPSC) simulation. The details of experimental as well simulation techniques used in the present investigation is described in chapter 3. To understand the philosophy of large strain deformation by shear in magnesium and its alloy, free end torsion tests could provide a guide line. Based on the understanding developed from these tests, further processing strategy could be planned. Therefore, a rigorous study of deformation behaviour under torsion was carried out. In chapter 4, the results of free end torsion tests carried out at different temperatures, 250 ⁰C, 200 ⁰C and 150 ⁰C and strain rates, 0. 01 rad. s- 1, 0. 1 rad. s- 1, 1 rad. s- 1 are presented for both the alloys. In addition to the analysis of stress-strain behaviour, a thorough microstructural characterization including texture analyses pertaining to deformation and dynamic recrystallization was performed. Both pure Mg and the AM 30 alloy exhibit similar ductility under the same deformation condition, while the strength of AM 30 was more. The strain hardening rate decreased with temperature and increased with strain rate for both the materials. However, the strain hardening rate was always higher in case of the alloy AM 30. Large amount of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) was observed for both the alloys. The initial texture had an influence on the deformation behaviour under torsion and the resulting final texture. The initial non-axisymmetric texture of pure Mg samples led to nonaxisymmetric deformation producing ear and faces along the axial direction, and the final texture was also non-axisymmetric. An examination of the texture heterogeneity was carried out in one of the pure Mg torsion tested samples by subjecting it to EBSD examination at different locations of the surface along the axial direction. The strain induced on the <b>ear</b> <b>portion</b> was maximum, and in the face was lower. This has been attributed to the orientation of basal planes in the two regions. The axisymmetric initial texture in case of the alloy AM 30 led to the formation of axisymmetric texture with no change in the shape of the material. Owing to this simplicity, the occurrence of dynamic recrystallization (DRX) was studied in more detail for this alloy. The mechanism of texture development due to deformation as well as dynamic recrystallization could be tracked at every stage of deformation. A typical shear texture was observed with respect to the strain in each case. Very low fraction of twins was observed for all the cases indicating slip dominated deformation, which was validated by VPSC simulation. It was found that with the increase in strain during torsion, the fraction of dynamically recrystallized grains increased. The recrystallization mechanism was classified as “continuous dynamic recovery and recrystallization” (CDRR) and is characterized by a rotation of the deformed grains by ~ 30 ⁰ along c-axis. After developing an understanding of large strain deformation behaviour of pure Mg and the alloy AM 30 through torsion tests, the possibility of low temperature severe plastic deformation for both the materials by equal channel angular extrusion (ECAE) was explored. The outcome of this investigation has been presented in chapter 5. At first, ECAE of pure magnesium was conducted at 250 ⁰C up to 4 passes and then the temperature was reduced by 50 ⁰C in each subsequent pass. In this way, ECAE could be carried out successfully up to 8 th pass with the last pass at room temperature. A grain size ~ 250 nm and characteristic ECAE texture with the fibres B and C 2 were achieved. The AM 30 alloy subjected to similar processing schedule as pure Mg, however, could be deformed only up to 6 th pass (TECAE= 150 ⁰C) without fracture. An average grain size ~ 420 nm and a texture similar to ECAE processed pure Mg was observed for this alloy. The difference in the deformation behaviour of the two alloys has been explained on the basis of the anisotropy in the stacking fault energy (SFE) in the case of pure Mg. Neutron diffraction was carried out to confirm and validate the microtexture results obtained from the EBSD data, while the local texture measurement by synchrotron radiation was carried out at different locations of the ECAE samples to give a proper account of the heterogeneity in texture. The effect of grain refinement was examined, deconvoluting the effect of shear in improving the strength and ductility using another severe plastic deformation technique, namely multi axial forging (MAF). In this process, the material was plastically deformed by a combination of uniaxial compression and plane strain compression subsequently along all the three axes. The details of this investigation has been presented in chapter 6. By this method, the alloy AM 30 could be deformed without fracture up to a minimum temperature of 150 ⁰C leading to ultra-fine grain size (~ 400 nm) with very weak texture. A room temperature ductility ~ 55 % was observed for this material. Finally, a comparison of room temperature mechanical properties of the alloy AM 30 was carried out for the ECAE and MAF processed conditions having similar grain size in order to observe the effect of texture formed during both the processes. A similar strength and ductility for both the cases was attributed to the orientation obtained from both the ECAE and MAF, which is away from the ideal end orientation for tensile tests. The final outcomes of the thesis has been summarized in chapter 7...|$|E

We report here that, in transgenic mice (Tg(bK 6 -E 6 /E 7)), {{the expression of}} the E 6 /E 7 oncogenes of human papilloma virus type 16 (HPV 16) {{under the control of the}} bovine keratin 6 promoter markedly improves the mouse's capacity to repair <b>portions</b> of the <b>ear</b> after being wounded. Increased repair capacity correlates with an increased number of epidermal proliferating cells. In concordance with the expected effects of the E 6 and E 7 oncogenes, levels of p 53 decreased and those of p 16 in epidermal cells increased. In addition, we observed that wound re-epithelization proceeded faster in transgenic than in wild-type animals. After the initial re-epithelization, epidermal cell migration from the intact surrounding tissue appears to be a major contributor to the growing epidermis, especially in the repairing tissue of transgenic mice. We also found that there is a significantly higher number of putative epidermal stem cells in Tg(bK 6 -E 6 /E 7) than in wild-type mice. Remarkably, hair follicles and cartilage regenerated within the repaired ear tissue, without evidence of tumor formation.

The offending loop of blood vessel is then mobilized. Frequently a groove or indentation is seen in the nerve where the offending vessel was in contact with the nerve. Less often the nerve is thin and pale.

50|$|Ear reconstruction.

Once emplaced and anchored with sutures, the surgeon then creates a pinna (outer ear) of natural proportions, contour, and appearance. In the next months, in follow-up surgeries, the surgeon then creates an earlobe, and also separates the reconstructed pinna {{from the side of}} the head (ca. 15-18 mm), in order to create a tragus, the small, rounded projection located before the external entrance to the ear canal.|$|R
