5|$|Shortly {{after her}} 17th {{birthday}} {{she changed her}} <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> with a pink rinse. She took judo lessons once {{a week at a}} local school, but found partners reluctant to train with her, as she was often slow to release her grip. She took a job at Bratby and Hinchliffe, an engineering company in Gorton, but was dismissed for absenteeism after six months.|$|E
5|$|Larter defined Clear {{as a girl}} who's {{suffered}} numerous {{losses in}} her life, has fallen into herself, and has made a life within that. She broadened her description as an estranged artist who's holding to her grip for what the world has given her. In the original screenplay of James Wong and Glen Morgan, she is described as the loner in the group who wears dark colors to hide her sex appeal, something she's insecure about. Larter dyed her hair brunette {{for the majority of}} the film to suit Clear's gothic outlook. Despite this, Larter reverted to her original blonde <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> for the film's ending.|$|E

50|$|D'Ambreville {{was born}} in Lorient, France and raised in Nice. At the age of 15, he began working at the Marotte Salon, a chain of salons on the French Riviera. The owner, Andre Marotte, {{arranged}} for D'Ambreville to study at the L'Oreal Institute in Paris, focusing on <b>hair</b> <b>colouring.</b> While there, he learned the Balayage technique, a <b>hair</b> <b>colouring</b> method that produces natural-looking highlights. Afterward, he returned to Nice, where he worked for three years.|$|R
5|$|Preserved {{woolly mammoth}} fur is orange-brown, {{but this is}} {{believed}} to be an artefact from the bleaching of pigment during burial. The amount of pigmentation varied from hair to hair and also within each hair. A 2006 study sequenced the Mc1r gene (which influences <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> in mammals) from woolly mammoth bones. Two alleles were found: a dominant (fully active) and a recessive (partially active) one. In mammals, recessive Mc1r alleles result in light hair. Mammoths born with at least one copy of the dominant allele would have had dark coats, while those with two copies of the recessive allele would have had light coats. A 2011 study showed that light individuals would have been rare. A 2014 study instead indicated that the colouration of an individual varied from non-pigmented on the overhairs, bi-coloured, non-pigmented and mixed red-brown guard hairs, and non-pigmented underhairs, which would give a light overall appearance.|$|E

25|$|For the 1956 Italian movie Mio figlio Nerone Bardot {{was asked}} by the {{director}} to appear as a blonde. Rather than wear a wig to hide her naturally brunette hair she decided to dye her hair. She was so pleased with the results that she decided to retain the <b>hair</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|E
25|$|Legolas's <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> is not {{definitively}} stated. Both Ralph Bakshi and Peter Jackson {{make him}} blond {{in their respective}} film adaptations (see below). This {{is supported by the}} fact that Thranduil, Legolas's father and a Sindarin elf, is described in The Hobbit as having golden hair. In a musical version of The Lord of the Rings, Legolas is dark-haired. In the real-time strategy game , his hair is white or silver.|$|E
25|$|Numerous melanocortin, MCH and {{melatonin}} receptors {{have been}} identified in fish and frogs, including a homologue of MC1R, a melanocortin receptor known to regulate skin and <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> in humans. It has been demonstrated that MC1R is required in zebrafish for dispersion of melanin. Inside the cell, cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) {{has been shown to be}} an important second messenger of pigment translocation. Through a mechanism not yet fully understood, cAMP influences other proteins such as protein kinase A to drive molecular motors carrying pigment containing vesicles along both microtubules and microfilaments.|$|E

25|$|In {{the genome}} of an organism, each gene {{is located at}} a {{specific}} place called the locus for that gene. Allelic variations at these loci cause phenotypic variation within species (e.g. <b>hair</b> <b>colour,</b> eye colour). However, most alleles {{do not have an}} observable impact on the phenotype. Within a population new alleles generated by mutation either die out or spread throughout the population. When a population is split into different isolated populations (by either geographical or ecological factors), mutations that occur after the split will be present only in the isolated population. Random fluctuation of allele frequencies also produces genetic differentiation between populations. This process is known as genetic drift. By examining the differences between allele frequencies between the populations and computing genetic distance, we can estimate how long ago the two populations were separated.|$|E

500|$|Nevertheless, Tapping {{found it}} a {{challenge}} to play a different character, as Carter and Magnus have differing personalities and points of view; [...] "after playing a character like Sam Carter for so long where her physicality is so comfortable – Sam is so comfortable in her own skin and Helen is this very sexual, more mysterious being. She has a much darker edge to her and {{it was sort of}} finding that because Carter always looks on the bright side and Helen has been around so long, and has seen so much of the evil in human society if you will." [...] Whilst filming the webisodes, Tapping wore a dark-haired wig, but when the television series was being shot, she dyed her hair to match the <b>hair</b> <b>colour</b> of the wig. Tapping spoke with an English accent throughout the run of the series. Although many of her relatives are from the United Kingdom and speak with British accents Tapping found the accent a challenge, as her character came from the Victorian era, which is a [...] "very specific way of speaking. She clings to that eccentricity a bit, to that Britishness." [...] The actress listened to several different voices, as she had to factor in the fact that Magnus lived all around the world.|$|E
