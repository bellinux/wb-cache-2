50|$|The {{standards}} of translation in Poland are regulated by a relevant {{department of the}} Ministry of Justice, and every translator wishing to provide such services must pass a state examination.

50|$|Though the {{definition}} varies, {{a person is}} usually considered an Indian {{if he or she}} has some Indian blood and is considered an Indian by the community.

To be identified as an Indian for federal and statutory purposes, however, a person must be a member of a federally recognized tribe.|$|R
60|$|From {{a modern}} point of view, the ministers, if doubtful, {{had a perfect}} right to be silent, and one of them, Hall, justly objected {{that he ought to}} wait for the verdict in the civil trial of the dead Ruthvens.

60|$|March 12.--The boy {{got four}} leaves of copy to-day, and I wrote three more.

60|$|Whether the drovers {{had seen}} him desert them or not, they did not follow to recover him, nor did the {{shepherd}} go to them {{to find out how}} they had got possession of him; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>enough</b> that he <b>had</b> got his dog back.|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} cosmology {{with complex}} scalar field. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> shown that such models can describe {{two stages of}} inflation and the oscillatory regime.

If the present accelerated expansion {{was created by the}} complex field then universe must escape eternal acceleration. Besides, we will show that cosmological equations with complex field admit stationary solution without any cosmological constant. Comment: 7 page...|$|R
