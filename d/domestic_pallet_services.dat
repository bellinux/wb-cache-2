The routes optimization of <b>pallet</b> <b>service</b> center {{is similar to}} the distribution problems of vehicle routing problem (VRP) and Chinese postman problem (CPP), but it has its own characteristics. Based on the relevant research results, the conditions of determining the number of vehicles, the one way of the route, the constraints of loading, and time windows are fully considered, and a chance constrained programming model with stochastic constraints is constructed taking the shortest path of all vehicles for a delivering (recycling) operation as an objective. For the characteristics of the model, a hybrid intelligent algorithm including stochastic simulation, neural network, and immune clonal algorithm is designed to solve the model. Finally, the validity and rationality of the optimization model and algorithm are verified by the case...|$|R

40|$|The {{evolution}} of web 2. 0 introduces the complementary features of service composition {{which focuses on}} community and usability of web services. The increasing number of applications on the web and a growing need to combine {{them in order to}} meet user requirements [...] Mashup is the process of assimilating web services for generating new services; it extracts data from various resources like PDFs, databases, legacy systems, and web applications. Before performing Mashup, the possible candidates for aggregation should be generated. In dynamically changing internet scenario, predicting service Mashup candidates are tedious one. This paper uses Syntactic technique to predict candidates and used for determine the equivalences among the services with reasonable precision, and it also analyzes the naming tendency of web service developers. The result makes the service search process to identify candidate services faster. This paper deals with the design of client side Mashup architecture with viable candidates for aggregating services. The system has a <b>pallet</b> of <b>services</b> that are clustered by their input and output. It would involve service connection, composition and data visualization. This framework allows users to play with services. ...|$|R
40|$|One {{significant}} {{component of}} the waste stream, discarded plastic products and packaging, {{continues to be a}} growing portion of the municipal solid waste (MSW). There has been considerable work done in characterizing the quantity and types of plastics in different waste streams, collection methods, separation, sorting as well as technologies for processing post-consumer mixed plastics. The focus {{in recent years has been}} the development of markets for recycled plastic products, which constitutes the second half of the material flow diagram cycle shown in Figure 1. One key product that holds significant promise for plastics recycling to be both technically feasible and economically viable is Recycled Plastic Lumber (RPL). The contents of this report forms the second phase of a two-phase pilot project on developing specifications and standards for a product fabricated from RPL. Such standards and specifications are needed to prepare procurement guidelines for state and federal agencies interested in purchasing products made from recycled materials. The first phase focused on establishing a procedure to evaluate RPL product,s such as pallets, in a laboratory setting while this phase focuses on field evaluation of RPL <b>pallets</b> in <b>service.</b> This effort is critical in the development of new markets for RPL products. A brief summary of the findings from Phase 1 of this effort is presented next...|$|R
40|$|Companies which want to {{introduce}} reusable containers to avoid waste have problems concerning the different reusable systems, {{the different types of}} packaging, different organisational and physical structure of the exchange processes and above all the resulting expenses. Furthermore, many manufacturers offer reusable containers and <b>pallets</b> but without <b>services.</b> In order to work out a decision basis existing packaging systems have to be analysed, adapted and/or renewed under consideration of changed rules and structures. The choice must not be made between one-way and reusable packaging but between one-way and reusable systems with all their specific advantages and disadvantages. Basic information on logistics organisation and management for reusable packaging systems is given. Costing structures of reusable packaging systems are explained and also cost allocation and control mechanism to cut costs...|$|R
40|$|Pallets, {{the most}} common unit-load platform, allow the {{transportation}} of goods in an efficient and reliable way. Every year, 700 million new pallets are manufactured and {{become part of the}} approximately 2 billion pallets that are in circulation in the U. S. The total life-cycle environmental impact of pallets depends on materials, manufacturing, handling processes, and the disposal practice (end-of-life). Plastic pallets can be lighter and might last longer but their manufacturing processes are energy intensive and could contribute significantly to greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. On the other hand, wooden pallets can be cheaper and easily repaired but present a shorter life. The ability to control the end-of-life of the pallets and the associated environmental impacts of each scenario allows <b>pallet</b> pooling <b>service</b> companies to provide logistics arrangements that are attractive to those companies seeking to better manage their carbon footprint. The appropriate choice of pallet type (i. e. material, durability, etc.) and management structure (e. g. cost, lease vs. buy, etc.) may lead to a more sustainable logistics operation. The {{purpose of this study is}} to provide a model that would determine the impact of pallet materials, manufacturing, distribution, and take back operations on an environmental performance metric (such as carbon dioxide emissions) as well as cost. Mixed integer programming (a minimum cost multi-commodity network flow problem) is used to design the system that determines the mix of pallets (type, quantity, and pallet management system) for product distribution that balances overall environmental impacts and costs according to companies 2 ̆ 7 needs. Such a tool would aid in decision making at the logistics and distribution levels. Results from a case study of a large grocery distributor/retailer in the Northeast is presented...|$|R
40|$|The Super Lightweight Interchangeable Carrier (SLIC) Grant {{consists}} of two separate but related phases. The first phase of this grant was conducted under a separate Institute for Scientific Research, Inc. (ISR) subcontract to FMW Composite Systems, Inc., of Bridgeport, West Virginia. FMW conducted early design and engineering associated with the future development of a stronger and lighter Space Shuttle carrier pallet. This improved pallet is intended to support the next and last planned Shuttle servicing mission for the on-orbit Hubble Space Telescope (HST). The salient characteristics of this carrier are increased performance, together with significantly reduced mass. As the next servicing mission is the last planned upgrade mission for the HST, this lighter and stronger pallet will enable greater payload delivery to the HST, potentially increasing the servicing mission effectiveness and science lifetime of the telescope. The second phase of this grant, conducted by ISR, consisted of a data systems study to exploit further {{the potential of the}} HST <b>servicing</b> <b>pallet</b> for other space missions, specifically for application of semi-permanent placement of science payloads on the International Space Station (ISS). As {{in the case of the}} HST, a lightweight and more rigid pallet could be employed to increase science return for the ISS. A data systems study intended to complement the current ISS s Institutional data system holds the potential of increasing the science return for data efficiency, just as the lightweight pallet serves to increase payload mass efficiency...|$|R
