(Polokwane Municipality is no exception). Records management as a major function of service organizations needs to be developed {{to cope with the}} challenges brought about by technology. The study, therefore, investigated the possible role of electronic records management in a service organization. The aim of electronic records management is to improve service quality. By making use of an electronic records management system, organizations can render quality service. The {{introduction of}} technology in records management affects several aspects such as space, time, costs, customer satisfaction {{and the role of the}} records manager. Although technology may improve the standard of service in organizations, it is important for organizations to embark on staff development programmes. Employees should be trained to use the existing system, and encouraged to further their studies. Furthermore, organizations should encourage employees to affiliate with professional organizations, as the latter enables employees to embark on a process of lifelong learning. Once a well-trained workforce has been established, responsibilities must be allocated. Employees should be made aware of their limitations. Some should be tasked only with scanning in new information, while others could be made responsible either for maintaining or disposing of records.

Furthermore, we analyze the delegation impacts on server selection as the NS records are obtained from both parent and child zone. We propose an integrated sever selection procedure to handle the lame delegation and enhance server selection efficiency. It makes use of the two stages of server probing information and can help save the initial server probing in the server selection algorithm.

Processes and {{practices}} for information management service delivery, including retention, retrieval and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> documents and <b>records,</b> {{are not easily}} quantified for benchmarking and performance improvement. Method. A mainly qualitative approach was applied to evaluate records management services in oil and gas sector organizations. A case study, with data gathered from eleven organizations by questionnaire and interview, explored records management challenges facing the industry. Analysis. Quantitative and qualitative analyses were carried out on the data. Given the small sample and the mainly qualitative approach, analysis of questionnaire responses was mainly descriptive.

The challenges faced by organizations are human and cultural and are specifically related to unwillingness to accept ownership responsibility and fear <b>of</b> consequences <b>of</b> <b>records</b> <b>disposal.</b> Conclusions. We argue that those responsible for information and records management must make a strong business case for investment in development of their people and services. This would avoid the consequences of failing to comply with 'legal holds' or e-discovery demands, thereby improving retrieval performance, business decision making and, ultimately, business performance.

As documents migrate to digital form from hard copy, sensitive personal information gets stored {{in a variety of}} places digitally. National and international laws are in place requiring companies to search for confidential data to ensure compliance. Some US examples include the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA). At the state level in the US, New York State’s <b>Disposal</b> <b>of</b> Personal <b>Records</b> Law (2006) requires businesses to “properly dispose <b>of</b> <b>records</b> containing personal information,” implying that this information must be unreadable and unrecoverable. International privacy laws, many of which are more stringent than those in the US, require similar activity. 2 To comply with these laws, security professionals use a variety of sensitive information discovery tools to find and remove readily available information stored on end-point devices. While current PII discovery tools can find information that is readily available, they are not capable of discovering information that has been encrypted, obfuscated, hidden, deleted or is otherwise unrecoverable. It is critical to note that the content and metadata of deleted files can be easily recovered using standard forensics tools.

The research within this paper explores the retention and <b>disposal</b> <b>of</b> email <b>records</b> within New Zealand tertiary institutions so that the attitudes of information professionals responsible for the retention <b>of</b> email <b>records</b> are captured, as are the perceived risks <b>of</b> managing such <b>records.</b> Methodology: For the purpose of this study quantitative data was collected to determine the understandings, attitudes, and concerns of information professionals. The unit of analysis was drawn from a population consisting of information professionals within New Zealand tertiary institutions. For the purpose of this research, tertiary institutions that operate as publically funded crown entities were identified. The research was undertaken with a Continuum perspective. Results: Within tertiary institutions, the issues of email management do not appear to lie with the appraisal policies or retention and disposal schedules. Instead the main risks associated with email records stem from the original creator, or end user, being responsible for identifying what emails are records and managing them appropriately. The implementation of electronic document and records management systems (EDRMS) varied between institutions, but majority of the research participants identified them as being of importance to the capture and management <b>of</b> email <b>records.</b> Implications: The findings show that there is a lack of empirical evidence into how the end users within tertiary institutions are treating email records.
