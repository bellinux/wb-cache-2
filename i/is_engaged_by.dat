5|$|Krell's Klingon battlecruiser and two Birds of Prey {{arrive in}} orbit and Krell orders the ships {{to destroy the}} colony. Enterprise {{attempts}} to intervene but <b>is</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>by</b> the Birds of Prey. Columbia arrives and joins combat with the two Birds of Prey, while Enterprise impedes the battlecruiser. Meanwhile, Phlox infects a restrained Archer, as he needs human antibodies for the cure. Antaak then transports a canister of the virus onto the battlecruiser which infects the crew, including Krell. Needing the cure from Phlox, Krell stands down the attack and the Klingon High Council soon agrees to distribute the cure throughout the Empire. Tucker then agrees to remain onboard temporarily to assist with repairs.|$|E

She is sitting by {{the edge of the}} road reading when Lord Rochester rides up to his ancestral home. The sight of his huge dog, coming upon her suddenly, so startles Jane that she jumps to her feet, causing Lord Rochester's horse to shy and throw its rider. He injures his ankle, and has to be assisted to remount by 'the little witch,' as he calls her, who is the cause of his accident. One evening the maniac escapes from her nurse and sets fire to the room in which Lord Rochester has fallen asleep. He is saved from a horrible death by Jane. When next Jane's haughty aunt and cousins call upon Lord Rochester, they are just in time to be introduced to his bride, who is none other than the despised Jane Eyre." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the latest}} {{campaign}} against the NTF, GTVA forces re-engage Shivan forces in the nebula, while testing out new weapon and technology prototypes such as an AWACS cruiser that enables better vision in the nebula, a TAG missile that enables friendly capital ships to instantly lock on to the [...] "tagged" [...] enemy ship, and the Pegasus-class stealth fighter. With the aid of these new technologies, the Alliance destroys a Shivan Ravana-class destroyer. [...] The 3rd Fleet soon return to GTVA space, where Bosch launches an assault to get the NTF to the Jump Gate. [...] While the NTF loses many ships, the Iceni escapes with Bosch on board, thanks to sabotage preventing the GTVA Colossus from firing on it. [...] While pursuing Bosch into the nebula, the GTVA attack Shivan nebular gas mining operations, only for the Shivans to retaliate with a juggernaut-class warship of their own, dubbed the Sathanas. The Sathanas enters Terran–Vasudan space, despite an effort to destroy the jump gate linking the nebula to Gamma Draconis; the node between the two system had stabilised at some point. [...] With the Shivans encroaching on GTVA space, the Sathanas <b>is</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>by</b> the Colossus as it enters the densely populated Capella system and, thanks to the player's efforts in disabling its beam turrets, is destroyed in the engagement.|$|E

When the hosts meet, Guinevere engages in combat with Cynric. Cerdic fights and kills Tristan before facing off with Arthur. Meanwhile, Cynric disarms Guinevere and <b>is</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>by</b> Lancelot. Cynric shoots Lancelot with a Saxon crossbow. Lancelot then throws his sword into Cynric and kills him. Lancelot dies with Guinevere at his side. Arthur kills Cerdic and the Saxons are defeated.|$|E
2500|$|Focused {{attention}} {{played a}} partial role in early models of natural scene perception. Such models involved {{two stages of}} visual processing. [...] According to these models, the first stage is attention free and registers low level features such as brightness gradients, motion and orientation in a parallel manner. Meanwhile, the second stage requires focused attention. It registers high-level object descriptions, has limited capacity and operates serially. These models have been empirically informed by studies demonstrating change blindness, inattentional blindness and attentional blink. Such studies show that when one's visual focused attention <b>is</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>by</b> a task, significant changes in one's environment that are not directly pertinent to the task can escape awareness. It was generally thought that natural scene perception was similarly susceptible to change blindness, inattentional blindness and attentional blink, and that these psychological phenomena occurred because engaging in a task diverts attentional resources {{that would otherwise be}} used for natural scene perception.|$|E

60|$|Ministerially is, {{when one}} person engageth or <b>is</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>by</b> virtue of respect or command from superiors, {{to go and}} obtain, by conquest or the king's redemption, the captives, or persons grieved by the tyranny of an enemy. And thus were Moses and Joshua, and the judges and kings of Israel, saviours--'Thou deliveredst them {{into the hands of}} their enemies, who vexed them: and in the time of their trouble, when they cried unto thee, thou heardest them from heaven; and {{according}} to thy manifold mercies thou gavest them saviours, who saved them out of the hand of their enemies' (Neh 9:27). Thus was Jesus Christ a Saviour; he was engaged by virtue of respect and command from God to obtain, by conquest and redemption, the captives or persons grieved. God sent his Son to be 'the Saviour of the world' (John 4:42).|$|E
60|$|If {{planning}} and scheming are confined within these limits, and conducted on these principles, the teacher will save all the agitating perplexity and care which will otherwise be his continual portion. He can go forward peaceably and quietly, and while his own success is greatly increased, {{he may be}} of essential service to the cause in which he <b>is</b> <b>engaged,</b> <b>by</b> making known his various experiments and plans to others. For this purpose {{it seems to me}} highly desirable that every teacher should KEEP A JOURNAL of all his plans. In these should be carefully entered all his experiments: the new methods he adopts; the course he takes in regard to difficulties which may arise; and any interesting incidents which may occur, which it would be useful for him to refer to, at some future time. These or the most interesting of them should be made known to other teachers. This may be done in several ways.|$|E
60|$|Of {{the capital}} {{engaged in the}} {{production}} of any commodity, there is a part which, after being once used, exists no longer as capital; is no longer capable of rendering service to production, or at least not the same service, nor to the same sort of production. Such, for example, is the portion of capital which consists of materials. The tallow and alkali of which soap is made, once used in the manufacture, are destroyed as alkali and tallow. In the same division must be placed the portion of capital which is paid as the wages, or consumed as the subsistence, of laborers. That part of the capital of a cotton-spinner which he pays away to his work-people, once so paid, exists no longer as his capital, or as a cotton-spinner’s capital. Capital which in this manner fulfills the whole of its office in the production in which it <b>is</b> <b>engaged,</b> <b>by</b> a single use, is called Circulating Capital. The term, which is not very appropriate, is derived from the circumstance that this portion of capital requires to be constantly renewed by the sale of the finished product, and when renewed is perpetually parted with in buying materials and paying wages; so that it does its work, not by being kept, but by changing hands.|$|E

6000|$|This {{is to be}} done, it must be remembered, {{when they}} are wrong, as well as when they are right. The {{obligation}} of the teacher is not founded upon the superior wisdom of his employers, {{in reference to the}} business for which they have engaged him, for they are very probably his inferiors in this respect; but upon their right as employers, to determine how their own work shall be done. A gardener, we will suppose, <b>is</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>by</b> a gentleman to lay out his grounds. The gardener goes to work, and after a few hours the gentleman comes out to see how he goes on, and to give directions. He proposes something which the gardener, who, to make the case stronger, we will suppose knows better that the proprietor of the grounds, considers ridiculous and absurd; nay, we will suppose it is ridiculous and absurd. Now what can the gardener do? There are, obviously, two courses. He can say to the proprietor, after a vain attempt to convince him he is wrong, [...] "Well, sir, I will do just as you say. The grounds are yours: I have no interest in it, or responsibility, except to accomplish your wishes." [...] This would be right. Or he might say, [...] "Sir, {{you have a right to}} direct upon your own grounds, and I do not wish to interfere with your plans; but I must ask you to obtain another gardener. I have a reputation at stake, and this work, if I do it even at your direction, will be considered as a specimen of my taste and of my planning, so that I must in justice to myself, decline remaining in your employment." [...] This too, would be right, though probably, both in the business of gardening and of teaching, the case ought to be a strong one, to render it expedient.|$|E
60|$|The {{first and}} the {{simplest}} emotion which we discover in the human mind is curiosity. By curiosity I mean whatever desire we have for, or whatever pleasure we take in, novelty. We see children perpetually running from place to place, to hunt out something new: they catch with great eagerness, and with very little choice, at whatever comes before them; their attention <b>is</b> <b>engaged</b> <b>by</b> everything, because everything has, in that stage of life, the charm of novelty to recommend it. But as those things, which engage us merely by their novelty, cannot attach us {{for any length of}} time, curiosity is the most superficial of all the affections; it changes its object perpetually; it has an appetite which is very sharp, but very easily satisfied; and it has always an appearance of giddiness, restlessness, and anxiety. Curiosity, from its nature, is a very active principle; it quickly runs over the greatest part of its objects, and soon exhausts the variety which is commonly to be met with in nature; the same things make frequent returns, and they return with less and less of any agreeable effect. In short, the occurrences of life, by the time we come to know it a little, would be incapable of affecting the mind with any other sensations than those of loathing and weariness, if many things were not adapted to affect the mind by means of other powers besides novelty in them, and of other passions besides curiosity in ourselves. These powers and passions shall be considered in their place. But, whatever these powers are, or upon what principle soever they affect the mind, it is absolutely necessary that they should not be exerted in those things which a daily and vulgar use have brought into a stale unaffecting familiarity. Some degree of novelty must be one of the materials in every instrument which works upon the mind; and curiosity blends itself more or less with all our passions.|$|E
