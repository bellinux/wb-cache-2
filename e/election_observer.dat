[...] However, the report also expressed concerns and raised several criticisms, both general and specific, of the electoral process and the election. The report includes 48 specific recommendations for future reform to [...] "strengthen the electoral process", such as introducing random automatic recounts {{in the case of}} a close election, shortening the campaign period, considering the introduction of a two round run-off system for presidential elections, and general clarifications in the electoral law (e.g., clarifying the grounds for requesting a recount and for the annulling of the election).|$|E

2500|$|Neilsen's {{claims were}} {{subsequently}} challenged {{by one of}} the 2006 election observers, who claimed that the New Zealand political economist had 'failed to understand' the mechanics of Fiji's electoral process. David Arms, who serves {{as a member of the}} Electoral Commission under Bainimarama's government, described the Neilsen/Lala/Vakatale report as weak and claimed that there was [...] "undue haste in its preparation" [...] (Arms, ‘A Critique of the Report of the Independent Assessment of the Electoral Process in Fiji’, 31 July 2007). The report was commissioned by ex Fiji Human Rights Commission director Shaista Shameem, who had publicly backed the military takeover. According to Arms, Dr Neilsen and his colleagues reached the verdict that the 2006 result had been ‘rigged’ mainly on the basis of evidence gleaned at public hearings, without any independent effort to verify the accuracy of the allegations. Arms' report states that most of those who showed up at the hearings had an axe to grind. They were defeated candidates or supporters of political parties that had performed poorly at the polls. Dr Nelsen's only evidence of electoral fraud had to do with alleged bias in the treatment of Indian voters' registration slips. However, <b>election</b> <b>observer</b> and Fiji-specialising academic Jon Fraenkel claimed that Dr Neilsen's claims were false: ...|$|E
2500|$|Perdue {{began working}} on human rights issues in 2000, when he {{traveled}} to Cuba {{to report on the}} condition of ordinary Cubans and dissidents, publishing an article on the subject in Investor’s Business Daily. In 2008, he wrote a series of articles that were published in the U.S. and Peru concerning a Peruvian general that had been falsely accused of collaborating with narcotraffickers in the VRAE region of Peru, a notorious trafficking area. The exposé aided in the general's subsequent exoneration by the Peruvian Supreme Court. In 2009, he traveled to Honduras as part of the Washington Senior Observer Group for the historic presidential election as an international <b>election</b> <b>observer.</b> In 2010, he served as an expert witness in a precedent-setting human rights trial in the Miami Circuit Court, which prevented the extradition of a U.S. citizen to Argentina, the defendant’s native country. In 2012, Perdue began writing articles highlighting the abrogation of free speech in Ecuador, after President Rafael Correa ostensibly [...] "used the courts, under what could be considered dictatorial powers, to jail journalists for calling him a dictator.” Correa had actually sued the editorial page editor of El Universo, an Ecuadorian newspaper, for saying, in an opinion piece, that he was acting like a dictator. The editorial page editor, Emilio Palacio, was subsequently forced to seek asylum in the U.S. In 2013, Perdue attended the Human Rights Foundation’s annual Oslo Freedom Forum in Oslo, Norway, to interview Cuban dissident and leader of the Ladies in White, Berta Soler, and wrote an article for the Miami Herald on Soler and the racial discrimination suffered by Afro-Cubans under the Castro dictatorship. He also interviewed Tutu Alicante, a human rights activist from Equatorial Guinea, and published an article for the UK Commentator in London.|$|E
