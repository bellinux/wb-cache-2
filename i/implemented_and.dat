5|$|Although Ruppert and his co-owner, Colonel Tillinghast Huston, {{were both}} wealthy, and had aggressively {{purchased}} and traded for players in 1918 and 1919 {{to build a}} winning team, Ruppert faced losses in his brewing interests as Prohibition was <b>implemented,</b> <b>and</b> if their team left the Polo Grounds, where the Yankees were the tenants of the New York Giants, building a stadium in New York would be expensive. Nevertheless, when Frazee, who moved in the same social circles as Huston, hinted to the colonel that Ruth was available for the right price, the Yankees owners quickly pursued the purchase.|$|E

5|$|Delays {{in finding}} the funding, {{opposition}} from the two mainline companies that the line was intended to connect, and World War I, led {{to the start of}} construction work being delayed until 1927. The line was completed and opened in January 1930, although the planned extension of the DR was not <b>implemented</b> <b>and</b> the service was provided by the Southern Railway. The opening of the line stimulated residential development as planned, but competition from the London Underground's City and South London Railway, which had its terminus at Morden, meant that the line did not achieve the hoped-for passenger numbers.|$|E

5|$|Other {{factors may}} include Enlightenment {{thinking}} and {{the examples of}} the Atlantic Revolutions. The Enlightenment spurred the desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout Spanish America and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and physiocratic economics were raised by the Enlightenment in Spain and spread to the overseas empire and a homegrown Spanish American Enlightenment. The political reforms <b>implemented</b> <b>and</b> the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors.|$|E
5|$|The Trait du Nord is an {{endangered}} breed; the Haras de Compiègne (Compiegne Stud), a national stud in France, {{had a major}} influence in saving the breed, until it was closed in October 2009. The national breed registry for the Trait du Nord is supported by other local initiatives. However, breed numbers were already low when these initiatives began to be <b>implemented,</b> <b>and</b> media attention on the Trait du Nord is insufficient to maintain economically viable interest. The breed is bred mainly by enthusiasts returning to family farms, but even the number of farms has been decreasing as many young farmers prefer more to breed cattle, which are more lucrative.|$|E

5|$|The ideological {{war between}} the Protestant and Catholic camps at first enriched the {{intellectual}} life of the Commonwealth. The Catholic Church responded to the challenges with internal reform, following the directions of the Council of Trent, officially accepted by the Polish Church in 1577, but implemented not until after 1589 and throughout the 17th century. There were earlier efforts of reform, originating from the lower clergy, and from about 1551 by Bishop Stanislaus Hosius (Stanisław Hozjusz) of Warmia, a lone at that time among the Church hierarchy, but ardent reformer. At {{the turn of the}} 17th century, a number of Rome educated bishops took over the Church administration at the diocese level, clergy discipline was <b>implemented</b> <b>and</b> rapid intensification of Counter-Reformation activities took place.|$|E
