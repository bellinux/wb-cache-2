40|$|Abstract The {{problem of}} steady, laminar, natural con-vective flow of a viscous fluid in an {{inclined}} enclosure with partitions is considered. Transverse gradient of temperature is applied {{on the two}} opposing regular walls of the inclined enclosure while the other walls are maintained adiabatic. The problem is formulated {{in terms of the}} vorticity-stream function procedure. A numerical solution based on the finite volume method is obtained. Representative results illustrating the effects of the enclosure inclination angle and the degree of irreg-ularity on the contour maps of the streamlines and temperature are reported and discussed. In addition, results for the average Nusselt number at the heated wall of the enclosure and the difference of extreme stream-function values are presented and discussed for various Rayleigh numbers, inclination angles and dimensionless partition heights.

5000|$|The low {{frequency}} driver in a resonant speaker <b>enclosure</b> <b>system</b> {{such as a}} ported cabinet or passive radiator cabinet cannot start and stop instantly like it can in a sealed-box cabinet. In order to achieve their bass output, ported speaker enclosures stagger two resonances. One from the driver and boxed air and another from the boxed air and port. This a more complex case than an equivalent sealed box. It causes increased time delay (increased group delay imposed by the twin resonances), both in the commencement of bass output and in its cessation. Therefore, a flat steady-state bass response does not occur {{at the same time}} as the rest of the sonic output. Instead, it starts later (lags) and accumulates over time as a longish resonant [...] "tail". Because of this complex, frequency-dependent loading, ported enclosures generally result in poorer transient response at low frequencies than in well-designed sealed box systems. Another issue is that a large cabinet will require a long port tube to be tuned properly, which means that bass reflex cabinets may be larger than a passive radiator cabinet with similar performance.|$|E

40|$|Considerable {{uncertainties}} {{are associated}} with the experimental estimates of emission rates of different volatile organic compound (VOC) species from the biosphere to the atmosphere. Some of this uncertainty derives from the sampling and analytical procedures used in emission rate measurements. A calibration system was developed in order to evaluate possible errors in the measurements of biogenic emission rates using a branch <b>enclosure</b> <b>system.</b> Two types of calibration procedures were tested, a standard additions technique and an internal standard procedure. Both techniques were used to evaluate possible losses while sampling isoprene and monoterpenes, which are the most abundant VOCs of biogenic origin. The losses to Teflon lines and the empty sampling system were tested and losses to the branch <b>enclosure</b> <b>system</b> installed on two VOC emitting plant species were evaluated. A considerable loss of isoprene (18 % of inflow concentration 65 ng l– 1) to the empty <b>enclosure</b> <b>system</b> and to the system installed on the plant was measured, but no losses of monoterpenes were observed...|$|E
