40|$|Gretchen BauerThe {{practice}} of female genital mutilation {{has become a}} hot button issue in recent years at both the national and international levels. One {{of the most highly}} debated issues is the role that international law should play in addressing a social practice that is based on cultural beliefs and norms. FGM is centered on a larger debate in human rights academia, which is cultural relativism versus universalism. Universalism refers to the notion that human rights are universal and should apply to every human being. Cultural Relativists disagree, and argue that human rights are culturally dependent, and that no moral principles can be made to apply to all cultures. Law alone will not create a change in social behavior, but the adoption of international and domestic law prohibiting FGM in Burkina Faso has created a positive effect in establishing a role for law in advancing the process of social change in conjunction with culture (Center for Reproductive Rights 5). FGM is a violation of the human rights of women and young girls, which is steeply rooted in gender roles formulated to subordinate women. <b>Female</b> <b>Gender</b> <b>Mutilation</b> affects about fifty percent of women and girls in Burkina Faso despite the practice breaching several international human rights treaties, which have been signed by states that have the most widespread use (WHO 3). Enforcement of Burkina Faso’s law on genital cutting needs to be strengthened through increased legal consciousness, effective sanctions, and the collaboration of local and global organizations because international law should address social practices that are violate basic human rights.

40|$|In this {{qualitative}} study ”Nice girls {{go to heaven}} {{but the rest of}} us go much further”, Johanna Olsson and Caroline Seveson examine how women in male-dominated management boards have experienced and handled <b>female</b> <b>gender</b> roles in order to reach management positions. The study has a gender perspective and semi-structured interviews were conducted with five women. Previous research shows that there is a role incongruity between <b>female</b> <b>gender</b> roles and management positions since these positions often are coded as male. To analyze the material, a theoretical framework was chosen based on previous research and the study’s empirical data. The framework consists of theories discussing structures that can affect women’s career progress and coping strategies that can be used by women to handle <b>female</b> <b>gender</b> roles in order to reach management positions. The analysis shows that <b>female</b> <b>gender</b> roles can affect women’s career progress. The role incongruity between <b>female</b> <b>gender</b> roles and male coded management positions {{does not seem to have}} affected the participants notably since they, in comparison to “nice girls”, match the male norm and male coded management positions. The participants have occasionally used a gender neutral strategy, conformist strategy and loyalty strategy in order to reach management positions and parts of the theoretical framework could be developed based on the result of the study...|$|R

The aim of the study is to examine the relevance of proposed contributing factors for the association between anxiety and depression, and eczema, including, omega- 3 fatty acid supplement, <b>female</b> <b>gender,</b> health anxiety and somatization. Methods Anxiety and depression was measured in the general population (n = 15715) employing the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Information on eczema, <b>female</b> <b>gender,</b> omega- 3 fatty acid supplement, health anxiety and somatization was obtained by self-report. Results Somatization and health anxiety accounted for more than half of the association between anxiety/depression, and eczema, while the other factors examined were of minor relevance for the association of interest. Conclusions We found no support for <b>female</b> <b>gender</b> and omega- 3 fatty acid supplement as contributing factors in the association between anxiety/depression, and eczema. Somatization and health anxiety accounted for about half of the association between anxiety/depression, and eczema, somatization contributed most.

This change of gender ('Lofou' is considered as being of <b>female</b> <b>gender</b> having the suffix [...] "ou") is also justified by the need to accompany the word Lofou with the word 'komi' which is also <b>female</b> in <b>gender</b> and means burgh.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to {{determine}} associations of thyroid hormone levels and different metabolic parameters and anthropometric measurements with volume of nodular and nonnodular thyroid as well as with prevalence of goiter and thyroid nodules in middle-aged euthyroid subjects. Methods. The study consisted of 317 euthyroid subjects aged 48 - 49 from the Kaunas Cardiovascular Risk Cohort study. Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), free thyroxine (FT 4), and antithyroid peroxidase antibody (ATPO) levels, as well as anthropometric and metabolic parameters and smoking information, were evaluated. Results. In subjects with and without thyroid nodules, thyroid volume correlated with components of metabolic syndrome, body mass index (BMI), smoking, and TSH levels. In the nonnodular thyroid group, thyroid volume was also positively related to serum insulin and HOMA-IR, whereas a negative correlation between thyroid volume and leptin was identified in the nodular thyroid group. The goiter was identified in 12. 3 % of subjects. <b>Female</b> <b>gender,</b> thyroid nodules, smoking, BMI, and levels of TSH were independent predictors for goiter.
