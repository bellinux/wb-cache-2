40|$|With {{census data}} on comparably defined American and <b>Japanese</b> <b>markets,</b> I assess {{the extent to}} which {{competitive}} advantage is determined by market network structure in the two economies. I find significant differences between markets in the two economies, but on average, the social structural parameters known to determine the relative performance of American markets similarly determine the relative performance of <b>Japanese</b> <b>markets.</b> Profit margins are similar on average in corresponding <b>Japanese</b> and American <b>markets,</b> but performance differences between similarly structured American and <b>Japanese</b> <b>markets</b> increase with competitive disadvantage. Being at a competitive disadvantage in Japan is less costly than in the United States. The original publication is available at [URL]...|$|R

5|$|The {{game was}} {{conceived}} by Yuji Horii around 1981, {{when he was}} 27 years old, shortly after he bought his first computer and learned to program with it by modifying other games. During this time, he read a PC magazine article about a computer game genre in the United States, text adventures. Horii noticed the lack of such games in the <b>Japanese</b> <b>market</b> and decided to create an adventure game of his own. Horii also cited the manga authors Tetsuya Chiba, Mitsuru Adachi and Katsuhiro Otomo as influences. The game was developed using the BASIC programming language.|$|E

5|$|In 1983, Toyota {{chairman}} Eiji Toyoda {{issued a}} challenge to build the world's best car. The project, code-named F1 (“Flagship One”) developed the Lexus LS 400 to expand Toyota’s product line in the premium segment. The F1 project followed the Toyota Supra sports car and the premium Toyota Mark II models. Both the Supra and Mark II were rear-wheel drive cars with a powerful 7M-GE or 7M-GTE inline-six engine. The largest sedan Toyota built {{at the time was}} the limited-production, 1960s-vintage Toyota Century, a domestic, hand-built limousine, and V8-powered model, followed by the inline-six-engined Toyota Crown premium sedan. The Century was conservatively styled for the <b>Japanese</b> <b>market</b> and along with the Crown not slated for export after a restyle in 1982. The F1 designers targeted their new sedan at international markets and began development on a new V8 engine.|$|E

The airing had been preceded by a promotional blitz with stars Lee Byung-hun and Kim Tae-hee appearing on numerous Japanese programs, in addition to billboards and posters being placed throughout Tokyo.|$|E
5|$|Since its launch, monthly sales {{numbers of}} the console have {{generally}} been higher than its competitors around the globe. According to the NPD Group, the Wii sold more units in the United States than the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 combined {{in the first half}} of 2007. This lead is even larger in the <b>Japanese</b> <b>market,</b> where it currently leads in total sales (having outsold both consoles by factors of 2:1 to 6:1 nearly every week from its launch to November 2007). In Australia the Wii broke the record set by the Xbox 360 and became the fastest-selling game console in Australian history, selling 32,901 units within the first four days of the console’s release. It also broke the 360’s Australian record for the quickest amount of time to sell 100,000 units, reaching the milestone within six months and two weeks.|$|E

The car debuted in January 1989 at the North American International Auto Show in Detroit and sales of the vehicle began the following September at a network of 81 new Lexus dealerships in the U.S. The LS 400 was sold along with the smaller ES 250, a rebadged version of the <b>Japanese</b> <b>market</b> Toyota Camry Prominent/Toyota Vista.

5|$|The console was {{publicly}} unveiled {{under the}} name Xbox One on May 21, 2013 {{in a press conference}} designed to cover the unit's broad multimedia and social capabilities. A second press event for the console was held during E3 2013, focusing on its video game-oriented functionality. At that time, Microsoft announced that the console would be released in 21 different markets on November 22, 2013, but this was later amended down to 13. The change, which pushed the release date for the other eight markets to 2014, was attributed to unforeseen complexity in localizing the device's voice recognition capabilities. Later, in September 2014, the Xbox One was released in 26 markets, including remaining markets in Europe, the <b>Japanese</b> <b>market,</b> and Middle Eastern markets.|$|E
5|$|The game's success, {{which went}} against what Square Enix assumed would happen {{due to the}} title's {{identity}} as a traditional role-playing game, prompted them to reconsider their strategy for game making, which {{up to that point}} had been geared towards developing titles tailored for western markets rather than focusing on the <b>Japanese</b> <b>market.</b> According to the developers, none of them believed that the game would be released overseas, and were overwhelmed by the positive fan feedback they had received. A manga titled Bravely Default: Flying Fairy began serialization online through Famitsu. Two compilation volumes were released in 2015 and 2016 respectively. Two supplementary books, released under the title Bravely Default: The Pocketbook of R, were released in December 2013. In addition to this, two drama CDs containing supplementary stories were released through 2013 and 2014. Music from the game was featured Theatrhythm Final Fantasy as DLC.|$|E
5|$|Lexus' {{arrival in}} the <b>Japanese</b> <b>market</b> in July 2005 marked the first {{introduction}} of a Japanese premium car marque in the domestic market. New generation LS, IS, ES, GS, and RX models subsequently became available in Japan along with the SC 430, ending domestic sales of Toyota-branded models under the Celsior, Altezza, Windom, Aristo, Harrier, and Soarer nameplates, respectively. The Altezza and Aristo were previously exclusive to Japanese Toyota retail sales channels called Toyota Vista Store, the Windom was exclusive to Toyota Corolla Store, the Celsior and Harrier were exclusive to Toyopet Store, and the Soarer was previously available at both Toyota Store and Toyopet Store locations. Lexus models sold in Japan featured higher specifications and a price premium compared with their discontinued Toyota counterparts. Sales for the first half-year were slower than expected, affected by the contraction of the domestic auto market and price increases, but improved in subsequent months with an expanded lineup.|$|E

50|$|With {{a growing}} demand for organic {{products}} in European and <b>Japanese</b> <b>markets,</b> the prospect of cross-pollination {{is perceived as a}} significant economic threat to the organic industry.
