50|$|The most elaborately accurate, but totally destructive, {{precious}} metal assay is fire-assay. (It {{may also be}} called by the critical cupellation step that separates {{precious metal}} from lead.) If performed on bullion (high purity precious metal alloy) to international standards, the method can be accurate on gold metal to 1 part in 10,000. If performed on ore materials using fusion followed by cupellation separation, detection may be in parts per billion. However, accuracy on ore material is typically limited to 3 to 5% of reported value. Although time consuming, the method is the accepted standard applied for valuing gold ore as well as gold and silver bullion at major refineries and gold mining companies.In the case of <b>fire</b> <b>assaying</b> of gold and platinum ores, the lengthy time required to carry out an assay generally is offset by carrying out large numbers of assays simultaneously, and a typical laboratory will be equipped with several fusion and cupellation furnaces, each capable of taking multiple samples, so that several hundred analyses per day can be carried out.

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} mainly with assaying of precious and noble metals, gold, silver, and platinum group metals. The determination f {{the amount of}} saleable metals (or other mineral products), in an ore {{is the most important}} step in evaluation of a mineral deposit. Most assays, even if well done, will not tell you how the material occurs in the rock or how much of it can be recovered, but if the amount hat is present in the first place is unknown, it is impossible to make any comment as to the efficiency of a recovery system. This may not be important because if a recovery can be made which will provide a large profit, that which is not recovered will not seriously affect the economics of the operation. However, where the grade, and thus the operation is marginal, this is a different matter. <b>Fire</b> <b>assaying,</b> with its origins in antiquity, is widely regarded as the best, if not the only, way to determine precious metals in naturally occurring ores. There are a lot of misconcep-tions about the universal applicability of fire assay methods and the more recent combi-nation of traditional fire assay collection techniques with laboratory instrumentation has given rise to a serious, if not ludicrous, situation in the case of some materials...|$|E

40|$|Gold alloys can be {{analyzed}} quickly and in a non-destructive manner using energy dispersive x-ray fluorescence analysis (ED-XRFA). Two factors determine {{the accuracy of the}} measurement; the repeatability precision of the instrument and the inhomogeneity of the sample. In principle, the first can be kept low, all be it, {{at the expense of the}} measurement time, which is typically between 100 sec and 1000 sec. Values of 0. 1 % 1 or better, matching the accuracy of the cupellation method (<b>fire</b> <b>assaying),</b> are possible. Inhomogeneous element distribution influences an individual measurement result. As the analyzed volume is determined by the measurement spot size, measurements should be made with as large a collimator as possible and repeated at different places. Statistical evaluations will then provide reliable statements about the uncertainty of the mean value. Whether it is preferable to use instruments with a semiconductor detector or with a proportional counter tube depends on the specific application and will be covered in greater detail later in this report. In addition, and to a limited degree, ED-XRFA permits the detection of coatings on the surface. It also allows for the differentiation between solid Au alloys and Au alloy coatings.

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} {{the problem of}} obtaining reliable laboratory scale flotation test data for the Merensky ore type found in the Bushveld complex of South Africa. The complex nature of the platinum-group element (PGE) deportment in this ore renders the normally-practiced procedures inappropriate for this particular testwork. A more robust and thorough procedure is necessary because of the diverse mineralogical forms in which the PGE are found. The evaluation of the mass and value balances has accordingly to take these factors into account. The major features of the evaluation of input and output errors across the laboratory scale flotation test are analysed. It is found that unless size-by-size variance of PGE in a conventionally crushed mill feed is taken into account the mill feed sample size is underestimated by some 176 %. Further the preparation of a reference distribution of assayed head material is necessary to provide the 95 % confidence limits of grade estimate. The need for repeating flotation tests and compositing the adjudicated products is discussed, concluding that quintuplicates are suitable to achieve a desirable level {{of confidence in the}} built-up head grade. The sample preparation of the flotation products has a critical role in minimising evaluation errors, {{as is the case with}} <b>fire</b> <b>assaying</b> of samples where minimum numbers of replicate determinations have been calculated. An outlier rejection model for adjudication of the replicate built-up head grades is proposed, and a complete flowsheet of the quality control model is developed from first principles.

40|$|The pyrometallurgical fire assay {{still remains}} the only widely {{accepted}} technique to concentrate platinum group elements (PGE) and gold from low grade ores and metallurgical intermediates. The traditional technique is labour intensive batch process where samples are not necessarily processed in a first-in-first out (FIFO) sequence. To {{get to the point}} of making fire assay based information useful for process control, a number of challenges had to be addressed. The process of sample preparation, the whole fire assay process and the final analysis for the PGE had to be automated so that the samples would be processed rapidly and analysed in a FIFO sequence. This is particularly difficult due to the amount of materials handling in conjunction with the high temperatures associated with the fire assay. The flux blend had to be "designed" or optimised for rapid fusion, insignificant metal entrainment and effective (quantitative) transfer of the PGE to the lead collector phase. This could only be done through a re-evaluation of the pyrometallurgical principles that control the slag chemistry so that the fusion sequence, slag viscosity and slag-metal interfacial tensions are well controlled. The slag separation from lead alloy had to ensure that no slag contamination of metal occurred. This was achieved through furnace re-design, {{and the development of a}} novel slag separator. Both stages (fusion and separation) had to be integrated and designed for robot manipulation and materials handling. Moreover, the traditional cupellation step of <b>fire</b> <b>assaying</b> had to be eliminated. To achieve the last stage an analytical methodology had to be developed to automatically weigh the lead and determine the concentration of the individual PGE using spark-OES based on the lead-PGE alloy matrix. The whole process, automated with a robotic carousel and meeting all the required objectives, was successfully implemented at Anglo Platinum. Turnaround time on analysis was reduced from 24 h to 60 min from the submission of a slurry sample to the laboratory. The accuracy of the new analytical method was confirmed using certified reference materials. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. Conference Pape...|$|E
40|$|All {{platinum}} group element (PGE) abundances of {{a standard}} rock JP- 1 are determined by isotope dilution method (for Ru, Pd, Os, Ir and Pt) and external calibration method (only for Rh) using ICP-MS combined with a <b>fire</b> <b>assay</b> preconcentration technique. The errors range 13 – 25 % (2 σ; n = 5), which are comparable with those by the similar methods combined with chemical separation of PGE (Pearson and Woodland, 2000; Meisel et al., 2001). Large deviations between our data and preferable values proposed by the Geological Survey of Japan (GSJ) are observed for Os and Ir. The scattered Os data might be indicative of heterogeneity of Os in JP- 1.

40|$|The {{solubility}} {{of gold in}} slags is {{of interest}} to researchers because gold/metal alloys are often used in distribution experiments {{as a way of}} correcting for metal entrainment in the slag. Gold is assumed to have negligible solubility in slags, on the basis that the Gibbs free energy of formation of gold oxides is very positive, so any gold found in the slag must be from entrained metal droplets. Toguri and Santander reported that gold solubility in iron silicate slag was up to 800 ppm. Altman & Kellogg used a Cu/Au alloy to determine the solubility of copper in iron silicate slag while Grimsey & Biswas determined the solubility of nickel in the same slag. They both erroneously quoted from Toguri & Santander that gold solubility was less than 80 ppm. Nagamori and Mackey made the same mistake and also claimed, without evidence that gold dissolves as neutral atoms in slag. Celmer and Toguri found the solubility of gold in an Al 2 O 3 -saturated iron silicate slag to be only 25 - 30 ppm. They assumed gold was present as neutral atoms. Gold solubility in slag is also an issue in <b>fire</b> <b>assaying</b> which involves, at one stage, gold in contact with molten PbO. If gold solubility in molten PbO is not zero then the fire assay result would be understated. Strangely, nothing was found in the literature relating to the solubility of gold in PbO slag. In this work gold solubility in iron silicate and calcium ferrite was determined by equilibrating approx. 5 g of slag and 5 g of gold in a small alumina crucible with CO-CO 2 gas mixtures at 1300 &# 0176;C. Gold solubility in PbO-SiO 2 slags was determined at 1100 &# 0176;C using oxygen/nitrogen gas mixtures. After 8 hours the crucible was lowered into the cool part of the furnace.

30|$|In {{chemical}} metrology most of {{the important}} decisions {{are based on the}} quality and the reliability of analytical results of quantitative analysis. In this context {{it is also important to}} have reliability of the results in international trade because analytical results should be acceptable to all users within the country or outside the country. This can be achieved by estimation of uncertainty in the measurements as per ISO/EURACHEM guidelines (ISO [2003]; VIM 3 rd edition JCGM 200 [2012]). The measurement uncertainty is carried out by quantifying of uncertainty in measurement of various steps, and further by combination of potential sources of uncertainty of the entire experiment. Thus all the above methods do not fulfill the requirement for precise and accurate determination of gold and due to gold’s high economic value; its quantification must be carried out with high accuracy and precision. The little variation in the results may cause huge losses to traders. Nevertheless, lead fire-assay, owing to its high precision and accuracy, is still the preferred method for determination of gold in jewellery (Ronlad [1980]; Peter [1997]; UNI EN ISO 11426 [2000]). The laboratories that perform gold <b>assay</b> consider the <b>fire</b> <b>assay</b> method the most preferred technique.

A set of electrodes comprised of stainless steel anode and aluminum cathode gave maximum recovery (96. 5 %) of silver. This simple, robust, environment friendly and highly sensitive method was effectively applied to various ores and rock samples. The developed method with slight modifications can also be applied for the recovery of other metals...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{understood}} that quality assurance {{is fundamental to}} the commercial evaluation of data, and the chemistry discipline in the mining industry is experiencing exciting challenges as it seeks to supply comprehensively verified analysis {{in support of the}} commercially rewarding fields of geology, mining and metallurgical extraction processes. Lead <b>Fire</b> <b>Assay</b> (Pb-FA) and Nickel Sulphide <b>Fire</b> <b>Assay</b> (NiS-FA) have for what seems like an eternity been the pre-eminent techniques for the analysis of Platinum Group Elements (PGEs) in Merensky and Upper Group 2, (UG 2) ores. Simultaneously reliable and robust, they are at the same time expensive, time consuming and labour intensive. An alternate method was being investigated for these analyses which dissolved the siliceous component of the ores, but insoluble dark green chromitite crystals became apparent under a light microscope. This unique study was established to extract such crystals from a UG 2 tailing stream (which is the waste stream from UG 2 Concentrator operations) and to investigate whether non-liberated PGEs existed within such crystals. A representative UG 2 tailings composite sample was prepared which was fused using sodium peroxide as a flux and dissolved in nitric acid prior to successful base metal (BM) characterisation. Pb-FA and NiS-FA collection techniques were successfully used for PGE characterisation of the sample at mg kg- 1 levels. Residual chromitite crystals (RCCs) were successfully extracted through fusion of the sample with a basic flux mixture of potassium hydroxide and sodium carbonate. This removed 98...|$|R
50|$|The main {{controversy}} {{was whether}} the deposit was a high grade deposit (due {{to the presence of}} large numbers of gold nuggets) or low grade deposit (due to the fine gold found in the slate belts). Conventional <b>fire</b> <b>assays</b> were yielding significantly lower grade results than metallurgical tests which were consistently returning high grade results. Continuous Grind Leach techniques were evaluated under option with Minnova Inc., but did not yield satisfactory results. In 1992 a Vat Leach test was conducted with Novagold (under option) which yielded grades of 4-6g/t Au with an 84% recovery rate. NovaGold was forced to drop its option due to financial difficulties.|$|R
