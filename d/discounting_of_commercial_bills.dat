40|$|This study {{analyses}} {{the impact}} of Protestantism on interest rates in England from the 16 th century to the Industrial Revolution. One of many myths about the usury doctrine - the prohibition against demanding anything above the principal in a loan (mutuum) - is that it ceased to be observed in Reformation Europe. As several authors have demonstrated, however, early Protestant Reformers, beginning with Luther, had essentially endorsed the long established Scholastic usury doctrines. The one major exception was Jean Calvin. Though retaining a strong hostility against usury, he permitted interest on commercial loans, while forbidding usury on charitable loans to the needy. That view may have been partly responsible for a crucially important breach in civil support of the usury doctrine. The first, in 1540, was an imperial ordinance for the Habsburg Netherlands permitting interest payments up to 12 %, but only for commercial loans. In England, Henry VIII's Parliament of 1545 enacted a statute permitting interest payments up to 10 % (on all loans); any higher rates constituted usury. But, in 1552, a hostile Parliament, with radical Protestants, revoked that statute, and revived it only under Elizabeth, in 1571. Since the maximum rate was also taken to be the minimum, subsequent Parliaments, seeking to foster trade, reduced that rate: to 8 % in 1624, to 6 % in 1651 (ratified 1660 - 61), and to 5 % in 1713 : a rate maintained until {{the abolition of the}} usury laws in 1854. The consequences of legalizing interest payments, but with ever lower maximum rates, had a far-reaching impact on the English economy, from the 16 th century to the Industrial Revolution. The first lay in finally permitting the <b>discounting</b> <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>bills.</b> Even if medieval bills of exchange had permitted merchants to disguise interest payments in exchange rates, the usury doctrine nevertheless required that they be non-negotiable, held until maturity, since discounting would have revealed the implicit interest. Evidence for the Low Countries and England demonstrates that discounting, with legal transfers either by bearer bills or by endorsement, with full negotiability, began and became widespread only after the legalization of interest payments in both countries. The importance for Great Britain {{can be seen in the}} primary role of its banks during the Industrial Revolution: in discounting commercial bills, foreign and domestic, in order to finance most of the working capital needs for both industry and commerce. The second is known as the Financial Revolution; and its late introduction into England, from 1693, was in part due to the limits imposed on interest rates. In its final form (1757), it meant the establishment of permanent, funded, national debt based not on the sale of interest-bearing bonds but on perpetual annuities or rentes. The origins can be found in 13 th-century northern France and the Low Countries in reaction to the vigorous intensification of the anti-usury campaign by the new mendicant orders, the Franciscans and Dominicans. Fearing for their mortal souls, many merchants refused to make loans and chose to finance town governments instead by purchasing municipal rentes (annuities). In 1250, Pope Innocent IV ruled that no usury was involved, because those buying rentes could never demand redemptions. Instead, they were licitly purchasing future streams of income. Continuing debates were not finally resolved until the issue of three 15 th-century papal bulls (supporting Innocent IV). By the 16 th century, the finances of most western Europe states had become largely dependent on selling both life and perpetual annuities. England was thus a late-comer, in importing this system of public finance. Fully immune to the usury laws, this Financial Revolution permitted the English/British governments to reduce borrowing costs from 14 % in 1693 to just 3 % in 1757, so that the British economy could finance both 'guns and butter', without crowding out private investments. Furthermore, since these annuities (Consols) were traded internationally on both the London and Amsterdam stock exchanges, they were a popular form of secure investments, which became, with land, the most widely-used collateral in borrowing for the fixed capital needs of the Industrial Revolution. usury, interest, annuities, bonds, public finance, bills of exchange, discounting, Scholastics, Old and New Testaments, Calvin, Luther, Protestant Reformers, Dissenters, Financial Revolution, England...|$|E

40|$|Correspondence {{issued by}} the General Accounting Office with an {{abstract}} that begins "The General Services Administration (GSA) awarded FTS 2001 contracts to Sprint and MCI Worldcom to provide long distance telecommunications services to federal agencies. The federal government began the sizable and complex effort of switching from the existing FTS 2000 contracts to FTS 2001 in June 1999. Several implementation issues have delayed this transition. One of these issues concerns the billing problems experienced by GSA and its contractors. GAO found that the billing problems often arose from changes in contracts and services. According GSA, these issues also arose from the differences between contractors' <b>commercial</b> <b>billing</b> practices and the government's practices. Because these billing problems were not promptly resolved, they had an adverse effect on the transition progress. GSA is taking steps to resolve current billing problems.

Another issue that affected the transition progress concerns the databases that supported the transition process. GAO found that although GSA developed an automated system to track transition data and develop reports, the FTS 2001 contractors did not furnish GSA with the data it needed to populate that management system's database. As a result, GSA and agency transition managers did not receive the timely and up-to-date information they needed to effectively plan and manage transition activities. ...|$|R

[...] Each of the twelve semiautonomous reserve banks set its own discount rates, subject to {{the approval of the}} Federal Reserve Board in Washington, made its own policy decisions, and set its own standards for what was eligible for discounting.Reflecting this intellectual heritage, Meltzer emphasizes (in common with Friedman and Schwartz in their Monetary History of the United States) the influence on the founders of the Fed of: (i) the assumption, which was to prove unfounded, that the gold standard would continue to prevail, and (ii) the then widely held (and now discredited) real bills doctrine, which advocated restricting central bank credit to the <b>discounting</b> <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> paper. [...] In Chapter 3, Meltzer covers the establishment of the Fed and its first decade of operations, a period when, as he shows, key issues such as the respective roles and powers of the Board and the (regional) Federal Reserve Banks were far from settled. [...] These were among the questions eventually addressed in the Banking Act of 1935, which made major changes to the 1913 framework, mainly in the direction of centralizing authority in the Board {{at the expense of the}} regional Federal Reserve Banks. [...] The 1935 Act also weakened the legislative mandate for the Fed to follow the dictates of the real bills doctrine (Meltzer, Chapter 6).|$|R
30|$|China’s {{small and}} middle {{enterprises}} (SMEs) account for 99 % {{of the total}} number of enterprises, and provide more than 80 % jobs, which is an important part of the national economy. However, due to the lack of sufficient collateral and the opaque information, it is difficult to obtain financial support from financial institutions. The problem of financing difficulties is a huge obstacle to the development of small and micro enterprises (Jiang et al. 2014; Wang 2016). Moreover, SMEs are often in a weak position in the product supply chain. Accounts receivable and advance prepayments occupy most of the liquidity of these enterprises, which undoubtedly would exacerbate their financial strain, increase the risk of capital chain broken, affect their normal operations and greatly reduce their production efficiency (Yao and Liu 2018; Zhu et al. 2016). Supply chain finance service takes the real trade background as the premise and relies on a core enterprise which effectively integrate the capital flow into the supply chain management process (Gelsomino et al. 2016; Lekkakos and Serrano 2016). Supply chain finance as a new way to solve the financing problems of SMEs would revitalize massive “dead” assets such as accounts receivable, prepayments and inventory warehouse receipts. According to the National Bureau of Statistics at the end of 2016, the net amount of accounts receivable of industrial enterprises in China was 12.68 trillion yuan. However, according to China’s commercial factoring industry development report, the size <b>of</b> China’s <b>commercial</b> factoring markets in 2015 was only about 200 billion yuan, and a large number of “dead” assets were still not fully revitalized.

In such a stage, what sustained the expanding distant trade? To answer the question, this paper investigates the commodity collateral loan, which had developed through the Tokugawa era. "Jun-eki-sha", which was established in 1874 at Yamaguchi prefecture, is the one of the representatives of such a traditional financial organization. Through the investigation of their books, "Jun-eki-sha" was found to be managed rather healthily, and it provided the commission merchants with the short term operating capital. Thus, expanding trades at the begging of the Meiji era were sustained, at least partially, by the heritage from the Tokugawa era: That is, the commodity collateral loan.

40|$|Inspired by Gerschenkron's thesis, {{this paper}} contends that {{conditions}} of institutional 'backwardness' in late-medieval England stimulated legal innovations {{to provide the}} foundations for negotiability in international financial instruments. Though late-medieval England was not 'backward' in the senses expounded by so many earlier historians, her financial institutions, in comparison with those found on the continent, were far less developed. More retrograde were English fiscal and monetary policies, which {{played a major role}} in the fall of England's wool trade, once her most lucrative source of revenue, and thus indirectly in the expansion of her cloth export trade, which came to be canalized on the Antwerp market, where the major financial innovations did take place. Medieval English bullionist legislation was particularly regressive, by contemporary standards, in attempting to prevent the use of credit in foreign trade, in order to force exporters to repatriate receipts in bullio n even if such policies had a seemingly noble purpose: to protect the integrity of the coinage, while eschewing continental practices of debasement. In their application, however, they not only hindered the use of credit but also prevented the development of deposit banking, with domestic transfer instruments, on the continental model. English Common Law, furthermore, was generally hostile to any developments that would make bonds, especially registered recognizances, fully transferable and negotiable. But, from the late thirteenth century, the crown proved to be progressive in permitting mercantile courts to utilize the practices of an international lex mercatoria. From the 1360 s, English merchants in the wool and cloth trades sought to reduce their transaction costs, to avoid costly recognizances and litigation in Common Law courts, by resorting to informal holograph bills payable to bearer. But these lacked legal protection in transfer payments, until 1436, when the London Mayor's law-merchant court specifically awarded the bearer of a dishonoured bill-of-exchange rights equal to those of the designated payee: the first recorded in Europe, serving as the vital precedent for a similar Antwerp court ruling in 1506 and for national Habsburg legislation in the 1530 s to establish full negotiability <b>of</b> <b>commercial</b> <b>bills,</b> including <b>discounting,</b> with revocation <b>of</b> the usury laws. ...|$|R

The distortion may reflect incentives for investment managers and appraisers to smooth potentially temporary price volatility, as well as systematic differences in the character and condition of the properties that tend to trade at different stages of the real estate cycle. ...|$|R
