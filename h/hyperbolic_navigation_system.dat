25|$|<b>Hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> can {{be divided}} into two main classes, those that {{calculate}} the time difference between two radio pulses, and those that compare the phase difference between two continuous signals. Here we will consider the pulse method only.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first of}} these <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> was the UK'S Gee and Decca, {{followed}} by the US LORAN and LORAN-C systems. LORAN-C offered accurate navigation at distances over 1,000 kilometres, and by locating [...] "chains" [...] of stations around the world, they offered moderately widespread coverage.|$|R
50|$|Meint Harms was {{the first}} to have {{attempted}} the construction of a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems,</b> starting with musings on the topic in 1931 as part of his master's examination at Seefahrtschule Lübeck (Navigation College). After taking the position of Professor for Mathematics, Physics and Navigation at the Kaisertor in Lübeck, Harms tried to demonstrate <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> making use of simple transmitters and receivers. On 18 February 1932 he received Reichspatent-Nr. 546000 for his invention.|$|R
50|$|Also, by 1940 the British {{had started}} {{development}} {{of a number of}} night navigation aids, and were already testing the Gee <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> on combat missions. These would be available in quantity in early 1942, just as the first of the new heavy bombers, the Avro Lancaster and Handley Page Halifax, would be arriving in quantity. These technological developments dovetailed with the policy changes influenced by Lindemann's report.|$|E
50|$|Gee, {{sometimes}} written GEE, was a {{radio navigation}} system used by the Royal Air Force during World War II. It measured the time delay between two radio signals to produce a fix, with accuracy {{on the order of}} a few hundred metres at ranges up to about 350 mi. It was the first <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> to be used operationally, entering service with RAF Bomber Command in 1942.|$|E
50|$|Multilateration is {{a common}} {{technique}} in radio navigation systems, where it is known as hyperbolic navigation. These systems are relatively easy to construct {{as there is no}} need for a common clock, and the difference in the signal timing can be measured visibly using an oscilloscope. This formed the basis of a number of widely used navigation systems starting in World War II with the British Gee system and several similar systems introduced over the next few decades. The introduction of the microprocessor greatly simplified operation, greatly increasing popularity during the 1980s. The most popular <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> was LORAN-C, which was used around the world until the system was shut down in 2010. Other systems continue to be used, but the widespread use of satellite navigation systems like GPS have made these systems largely redundant.|$|E
50|$|Datatrak was a <b>hyperbolic</b> radio <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> {{similar to}} Decca, which {{operated}} on frequencies between 130 kHz and 150 kHz in the LF-range.|$|R
50|$|Decca, OMEGA, and LORAN-C {{are three}} similar <b>{{hyperbolic}}</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems.</b> Decca was a hyperbolic low frequency radio <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> (also known as multilateration) that was first deployed during World War II when the Allied forces needed {{a system which}} could be used to achieve accurate landings. As was the case with Loran C, its primary use was for ship navigation in coastal waters. Fishing vessels were major post-war users, but it was also used on aircraft, including a very early (1949) application of moving-map displays. The system was deployed in the North Sea and was used by helicopters operating to oil platforms.|$|R
25|$|At long ranges the {{hyperbolic}} lines approximate {{straight lines}} radiating {{from the center}} of the baseline. When two such signals from a single chain are considered, the resulting pattern of lines becomes increasingly parallel as the baseline distance becomes smaller in comparison to the range. Thus at short distances the lines cross at angles close to 90degrees, and this angle steadily reduces with range. As the accuracy of the fix depends on the crossing angle, and all <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> grow increasingly inaccurate with increasing range.|$|R
5000|$|At a 1 October 1940 {{meeting of}} the US Army Signal Corps' Technical Committee, Alfred Loomis, chair of the Microwave Committee, {{proposed}} building a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system.</b> He predicted that such a system could provide an accuracy of at least 1000 feet m at a range of 200 mi, and a maximum range of 300-500 mi for high-flying aircraft. This led to the [...] "Precision Navigational Equipment for Guiding Airplanes" [...] specification, which {{was sent back to}} the Microwave Committee and formed up as [...] "Project 3". Orders for initial systems were sent out at a follow-up meeting on 20 December 1940. Edward George Bowen, developer of the first airborne radar systems, was also at the 20 December meeting, and stated that he was aware of similar work in the UK, but didn't know enough about it to offer any suggestions.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two ways}} to {{implement}} the timing measurements needed for a <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system,</b> pulse timing systems like Gee and LORAN, and phase-timing systems like the Decca Navigator System. The former requires sharp pulses of signal, and their accuracy is generally limited to how rapidly the pulses can be turned on and off, which is, in turn, a function of the carrier frequency. There is an ambiguity in the signal, the same measurements can be valid at two locations relative to the broadcasters, but in normal operation these are hundreds of kilometers apart so one possibility can be eliminated. The second system requires constant signals ("continuous wave") and is easy to use even at low frequencies. However, its signal is ambiguous over the distance of a wavelength, meaning there are hundreds of locations that will return the same signal, referred to as cells in Decca. This demands some other navigation method to be used in conjunction to pick which cell the receiver is within.|$|E
5000|$|Project 3, a {{long-range}} navigation system, was {{of particular interest}} to Great Britain. They had an existing <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>system,</b> called GEE, but it was inadequate, in both range and accuracy, to support aircraft during bombing runs on distant targets in Europe. When briefed by the Tizard Mission about GEE, Alfred Loomis personally conceptualized a new type of system that would overcome the deficiencies of GEE, and the development of his LORAN (an acronym for Long Range Navigation) was adopted as an initial project. The LORAN Division was established for the project and headed by Donald G. Fink. Operating in the Low Frequency (LF) portion of the radio spectrum, LORAN was the only non-microwave project of the Rad Lab. Incorporating major elements of GEE, LORAN was highly successful and beneficial to the war effort. By the end of hostilities, about 30 percent of the Earth's surface was covered by LORAN stations and used by 75,000 aircraft and surface vessels. [...] Following the Japanese Attack on Pearl Harbor and the entry of the U.S. into World War II, work at the Rad Lab greatly expanded. At the height of its activities, the Rad Lab employed nearly 4,000 people working in several countries. The Rad Lab had constructed, and was the initial occupant of, MIT's famous Building 20. Costing just over $1 million, {{this was one of the}} longest-surviving World War II temporary structures.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the last}} <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> to enter {{operational}} use {{was one of the}} earliest to be developed; Omega traces its history to work by John Alvin Pierce in the 1940s, working on the same basic idea as the Decca phase-comparison system. He imagined a system specifically for medium-accuracy global navigation, and thus selected the extremely low frequency of 10 kHz {{as the basis for the}} signal. However, the problem with phase ambiguity, as in the case of Decca, meant that the system was not practical at the time.|$|R
50|$|<b>Hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> are a {{modified}} form of transponder systems which {{eliminate the need}} for an airborne transponder. The name refers {{to the fact that they}} do not produce a single distance or angle, but instead indicate a location along any number of hyperbolic lines in space. Two such measurements produces a fix. As these systems are almost always used with a specific navigational chart with the hyperbolic lines plotted on it, they generally reveal the receiver's location directly, eliminating the need for manual triangulation. As these charts were digitized, they became the first true location-indication navigational systems, outputting the location of the receiver as latitude and longitude. Hyperbolic systems were introduced during World War II and remained the main long-range advanced <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> until GPS replaced them in the 1990s.|$|R
50|$|The Decca Navigator System was a <b>hyperbolic</b> radio <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> {{which allowed}} ships and {{aircraft}} {{to determine their}} position by receiving radio signals from fixed navigational beacons. The system used phase comparison of low frequencies from 70 to 129 kHz, as opposed to pulse timing systems like Gee and LORAN. This made {{it much easier to}} implement the receivers using 1940s electronics.|$|R
40|$|We {{present a}} new {{approach}} to graph visualization called GIST using immersive technologies. Large graphs are studied using a partial immersive display called the Immersadesk. A virtual graph projected in this 3 D virtual world gives the user a sense of the true reality of the graph. We use a customized editor to manipulate and view the graph. A new navigation system allows the user to walk to the different parts of the graph. GIST uses new programming and optimization techniques to speed up graph drawing. A new standard called GML is used which makes the graphs generated portable across platforms and editors. The design of GIST allows nodes of the order of 5000 nodes to be viewed with ease.

The first results on these three topics are presented...|$|R

50|$|Loran-C was a <b>hyperbolic</b> radio <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> {{which allowed}} a {{receiver}} {{to determine its}} position by listening to low frequency radio signals transmitted by fixed land-based radio beacons. Loran-C combined two different techniques to provide a signal that was both long-range and highly accurate, traits that had formerly been at odds. The downside was {{the expense of the}} equipment needed to interpret the signals, which meant that Loran-C was used primarily by militaries after it was first introduced in 1957.|$|R

50|$|The {{gyrocompass}} {{was introduced}} in 1908 while ship's radar came in after the 1930s. Radar is also used on land for monitoring the position of shipping, for example in the Strait of Dover which is the busiest area of sea in the world. The Decca Navigator System was a <b>hyperbolic</b> radio <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> that was installed around the coasts of Britain in the 1940s. It was phased out after the introduction of satellite-based navigation from the 1960s. The echo sounding {{was introduced in}} the 1930s to determine water depth.|$|R

50|$|<b>Hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> {{refers to}} a class of <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> based on the {{difference}} in timing between the reception of two signals, without reference to a common clock. This timing reveals the difference in distance from the receiver to the two stations. Plotting all of the potential locations of the receiver for the measured delay produces a series of hyperbolic lines on a chart. Taking two such measurements and looking for the intersections of the hyperbolic lines reveals the receiver's location to be {{in one of two}} locations. Any other form of navigation information can be used to eliminate this ambiguity and determine a fix.|$|R
50|$|The {{basic idea}} of radio-based <b>hyperbolic</b> <b>navigation</b> {{was well known}} in the 1930s, but the {{equipment}} needed to build it was not widely available at the time.

40|$|On the European market, <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> gain growing {{importance}} {{for the support of}} travellers on both their everyday and special travels. So they have the possibility to contribute to the optimization of transport. This assumes that <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> are not just a part of the standard equipment of cars, but have to be used frequently. Therefore a broad acceptance of <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> has to exist. Following a scheme of acceptance which understands acceptance as a dynamic process the availability and use of <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> as well as the influence on travel behaviour and travellers’ references while using a <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> are analyzed in this article.

50|$|Inertial <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> {{is a dead}} {{reckoning}} type of <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> that computes its position based on motion sensors. Once the initial latitude and longitude is established, the system receives impulses from motion detectors that measure the acceleration along three or more axes enabling it to continually and accurately calculate the current latitude and longitude. Its advantages over other <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> are that, once the starting position is set, {{it does not require}} outside information, it is not affected by adverse weather conditions and it cannot be detected or jammed. Its disadvantage is that since the current position is calculated solely from previous positions, its errors are cumulative, increasing at a rate roughly proportional to the time since the initial position was input. Inertial <b>navigation</b> <b>systems</b> must therefore be frequently corrected with a location 'fix' from some other type of <b>navigation</b> <b>system.</b> The US Navy developed a Ships Inertial <b>Navigation</b> <b>System</b> (SINS) during the Polaris missile program to ensure a safe, reliable and accurate <b>navigation</b> <b>system</b> for its missile submarines.
