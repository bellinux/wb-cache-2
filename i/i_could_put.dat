500|$|Following {{the move}} to a Friday evening timeslot, Enterprise was going up {{directly}} against episodes of Stargate SG-1 on the Sci Fi Channel. The overall ratings by Nielsen Media Research placed the show in 150th place for the season. The season opened with ratings of 2.0/4 percent {{for the first part}} of [...] "", [...] but the series lowest ratings were received for the mid season episode [...] "". Five other episodes equalled the 2.0/4 percent ratings of [...] "Storm Front" [...] while [...] "Cold Station 12", [...] "The Augments" [...] and [...] "Kir'Shara" [...] each received 2.1/4 percent ratings. However, the highest ratings of the seasons were received for the series finale, [...] "These Are The Voyages...", which gained ratings of 2.4/4 percent. Rick Berman credited the falling ratings received by the series to a variety of elements saying, [...] "The show certainly had a great start. It got very good reviews and it had a huge audience for the first half a dozen episodes and then it started to slip. I could take the blame for it. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> the blame into the scripts. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> the blame into franchise fatigue. I don’t know why it didn’t work." ...|$|E
500|$|Saadiq called The Way I See It [...] "the {{culmination}} of a lifetime of experiences informed by the music I grew up on." [...] Kristal Hawkins of The Village Voice said that he [...] "hit his artistic maturity" [...] with the album. Robert Christgau remarked on its place in his solo career, [...] "In 1996, Saadiq turned the climactic Tony! Toni! Toné! album into a virtuoso history lesson. Six years later, he tried to dazzle Maxwell in his own reflected glory. Six years later yet again, he outd himself with a fearless return to retro." [...] Elton John, a fan of Saadiq's music since his beginnings with Tony! Toni! Toné!, {{said that he was}} [...] "blown away" [...] by The Way I See It, citing it as [...] "my album of the year – a soul record of the highest quality." [...] He subsequently called Saadiq to congratulate him for the album and ask him to play at his AIDS Foundation Academy Award Party in 2009. In an interview for Blues & Soul, Saadiq elaborated on the album's impact on his career: [...] "before that record – after I'd been in Tony Toni Tone! and Lucy Pearl – most people had thought 'Oh well, he's a producer now. He’s never gonna be an artist, he's not gonna put the time in' ... The Way I See It showed them that yes, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> the time in still and be an artist!" ...|$|E
2500|$|... "With drugs I could {{suddenly}} abstract {{my thought}} processes {{in a certain}} way, and I {{wanted to see if}} <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> them on a record. A lot of people recognized it as the dynamics of a psychedelic trip—it was almost like painting with your head." ...|$|E
60|$|VENABLES [good-naturedly]. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> {{you to that}} trouble, Mrs. Shand. I {{will take}} good care of it.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Oh! I wish I had known! <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>put</b> off my visit; and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> {{have come}} {{any other time}} to suit you.' She smiled gently: ...|$|R
60|$|Yes. The {{book came}} from me. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> a {{memorandum}} {{to that effect}} on the title-page, in consequence of my being here.|$|R
2500|$|In 1984, he {{was cast}} as Angela Channing's (Jane Wyman) lawyer Greg Reardon in {{the soap opera}} Falcon Crest, without {{requiring}} an audition. MacCorkindale asked for the character, originally an American named Brad, to be rewritten as English, and also directed one episode. He rejected a contract extension after appearing in 59 episodes and left the series in 1986 because he [...] "felt that the work I was doing was fun and lucrative but not as stretching as I felt I wanted or needed. I also was finding fault {{with much of the}} work, not only Falcon Crest, but everything. I was actually ready to quit acting and try producing so <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> myself on the line." ...|$|E
2500|$|While {{promoting}} his debut album, Everyday Robots, {{in an interview}} with NME, Albarn said: [...] "I can definitely see another Gorillaz-esque record at some point, yeah. That will almost definitely happen. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> a Gorillaz record out next week; I’ve got enough stuff that I haven’t finished. The only thing really that defines a Gorillaz record in my head is when I just play most of it on keyboards. I’ve just been in Paris with Jamie Hewlett. There are points in everyone's relationship where they fall out with people that they're close to and then they reconcile, hopefully, and actually, you know, the relationship's probably in a healthier place as a result of that." ...|$|E
2500|$|Speaking to Rolling Stone {{magazine}} in early 1979, {{by which time}} he and Arias were married and {{the parents of a}} newborn son, Dhani, Harrison further acknowledged Arias' positive influence on his life when discussing the despondency behind his Dark Horse song [...] "Simply Shady": [...] "I wasn't ready to join Alcoholics Anonymous or anything – I don't think I was that far gone – but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> back a bottle of brandy occasionally, plus all the other naughty things that fly around. I just went on a binge... Then I met Olivia and it all worked out fine." [...] Other Harrison love songs dedicated to Arias include [...] "Dark Sweet Lady" [...] and [...] "Your Love Is Forever", both released on the 1979 album George Harrison.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Jethro, reflectively, [...] "I don't know as <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>put</b> {{it as well}} as that--there's somethin' {{in being}} an orator." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ah, yes; but <b>I</b> <b>could</b> never <b>put</b> up {{with the}} distaste of being welcomed among such people as you mean, whilst <b>I</b> <b>could</b> get {{indifference}} among such people as hers.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> my {{thoughts}} into form, {{and with my}} mind in chaos I strode {{up and down the}} room until Miss Laniston returned.|$|R
2500|$|A {{decade after}} the incident, former FCC {{chairman}} Michael Powell gave his first interview regarding Jackson's performance, saying Jackson was treated unfairly and the controversy, including his own reaction, was completely overblown. Powell stated, [...] "I think we've been removed from this long {{enough for me to}} tell you that I had to put my best version of outrage on that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> on. Part of it was surreal, right? Look, I think it was dumb to happen, and they knew the rules and were flirting with them, and my job is to enforce the rules, but, you know, really? This is what we're gonna do?" [...] Powell also said the treatment of Jackson, who was lambasted for causing [...] "an outrageous stunt", was unfair, and commented on Timberlake not receiving the same backlash. [...] "I personally thought that was really unfair", he said. [...] "It all turned into being about her. In reality, if you slow the thing down, it’s Justin ripping off her breastplate." ...|$|E
60|$|WINIFRED. Ah, yes!--ah, yes! If only <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> {{it in my}} model.|$|E

6000|$|She {{surprised}} him, by answering with asperity, {{prompted by}} a second attack on this subject, 'I can't help it. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> her off,--what objection can there be?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "God bless you, my dearest, dearest friend! If {{you could}} only know how anxious I have been not to be wrong. But things have been wrong, and <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> them right." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The {{young lady}} wished it left there, sir. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> have <b>put</b> {{a couple of}} plugs in, in five minutes, and brought her up to the house, but she wouldn't hear of it." ...|$|R
60|$|Rho. Ay, too many, Palamede. If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> {{them into}} {{three or four}} women, I should be content.|$|E
60|$|If Miss Sparhawk {{cared to}} listen to me for five minutes, I feel <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> her right on this point.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'll take {{a message}} to the poor thing, with the {{greatest}} pleasure," [...] answered Sergeant Cuff, before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> in a word edgewise.|$|E
60|$|At {{the end of}} {{the first}} hour we were halted for ten minutes, and then the advance was {{continued}} until it seemed to me that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> one foot before the other.|$|R
60|$|They are all witty dogs, thought I to myself, {{trying to}} make the best of the matter, for I saw it would not do to resent what they said; they can't mean any harm, though they are {{certainly}} very impudent; so I tried to laugh off their banter, but as soon as ever <b>I</b> <b>could,</b> <b>I</b> <b>put</b> down my name and beat a retreat.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Not with you, Venetia, {{not with}} you,' said George 'you have a hold over him which nothing can ever shake. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> always <b>put</b> {{him in an}} amiable mood in an instant by {{mentioning}} your name.' ...|$|R

60|$|Pomona quickly {{saw that}} we were ill at ease, and before <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> a {{question}} to her, she divined the cause. Her countenance fell.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hate the}} sight of them! If <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> them and their blessed copybooks and lexicons and slates into one bonfire I'd do it to-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, {{he was up}} in {{the loft}} at the time, so that <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> it into his own hands, but I gave it into Mrs. Barrymore's hands, and she promised to deliver it at once." ...|$|R
6000|$|And yet, much as I {{felt this}} {{injustice}} and {{much as the}} city affected me, <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> it into fiction. [...] "It is not my material," [...] I said. [...] "My dominion is the West." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I think <b>I</b> <b>could</b> <b>put</b> {{him into}} the out-house in the field next to the copse, hide his trappings here, and get him provender from Ewins's farm. Will that do?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} it over, Captain, many times. It seems to me, sometimes, that I {{have a sort of}} notion why it is; but it is not clear, even to myself. <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> it into words." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I confide Betty's {{education}} {{entirely to}} you, Stephen," [...] she said, with another plaintive sigh. [...] "I feel sure <b>I</b> <b>could</b> not <b>put</b> it into better hands. You {{have always been}} a person who could be thoroughly depended on." ...|$|R
