River otters generally feed on prey that is in larger supply and easier to catch. As a result, slow-swimming fish are consumed more often than game fishes when both are equally available. Slow-moving species include suckers (Catostomidae), catfish, sunfish and bass (Centrarchidae); and daces, carp, and shiners (Cyprinidae). For instance, Catostomidae are the primary dietary component of river otters in Colorado's Upper Colorado River Basin. Likewise, the common carp (Cyprinus carpio) is a preferred fish species for the otter in other regions of Colorado. Fish species frequently found in the diets of the North American river otters include: Catostomidae, which consists of suckers (Catostomus spp.) and redhorses (Moxostoma spp.); Cyprinidae, made up of carp (Cyprinus spp.), chubs (Semotilus spp.), daces (Rhinichthys spp.), shiners (Notropis and Richardsonius spp.), and squawfishes (Ptychocheilus spp.); and Ictaluridae, which consists of bullheads and catfish (Ictalurus spp.). Other fish {{an integral part of the}} river otters' diets are those that are often plentiful and found in large schools: sunfish (Lepomis spp.); darters (Etheostoma spp.); and perches (Perca spp.). Bottom-dwelling species, which have the tendency to remain immobile until a predator is very close, are susceptible to river otters. These include mudminnows (Umbra limi) and sculpins (Cottus spp.). Game fish, such as trout (Salmonidae) and pike (<b>Esocidae),</b> are not a significant component of their diets. They are less likely to be prey for the North American river otters since they are fast-swimming and can find good escape cover. However, river otters will prey on trout, pike, walleye (Sander vitreus vitreus), salmon (Oncorhynchus spp.), and other game fish during spawning.|$|E

40|$|Background A long, {{slender body}} plan {{characterized}} by an elongate antorbital region and posterior displacement of the unpaired fins has evolved multiple times within ray-finned fishes, and is associated with ambush predation. The axial skeleton of ray-finned fishes is divided into abdominal and caudal regions, considered to be evolutionary modules. In this study, we test whether the convergent evolution of the ambush predator body plan is associated with predictable, regional changes in the axial skeleton, specifically whether the abdominal region is preferentially lengthened relative to the caudal region through the addition of vertebrae. We test this hypothesis in seven clades showing convergent evolution of this body plan, examining abdominal and caudal vertebral counts in over 300 living and fossil species. In four of these clades, we also {{examined the relationship between}} the fineness ratio and vertebral regionalization using phylogenetic independent contrasts. Results We report that in five of the clades surveyed, Lepisosteidae, <b>Esocidae,</b> Belonidae, Sphyraenidae and Fistulariidae, vertebrae are added preferentially to the abdominal region. In Lepisosteidae, <b>Esocidae,</b> and Belonidae, increasing abdominal vertebral count was also significantly related to increasing fineness ratio, a measure of elongation. Two clades did not preferentially add abdominal vertebrae: Saurichthyidae and Aulostomidae. Both of these groups show the development of a novel caudal region anterior to the insertion of the anal fin, morphologically differentiated from more posterior caudal vertebrae. Conclusions The preferential addition of abdominal vertebrae in fishes with an elongate body shape is consistent with the existence of a conservative positioning module formed by the boundary between the abdominal and caudal vertebral regions and the anterior insertion of the anal fin. Dissociation of this module is possible, although less probable than changes in the independently evolving abdominal region. Dissociation of the axial skeleton-median fin module leads to increased regionalization within the caudal vertebral column, something that has evolved several times in bony fishes, and may be homologous with the sacral region of tetrapods. These results suggest that modularity of the axial skeleton may result in somewhat predictable evolutionary outcomes in bony fishes...|$|E

Climate envelope models developed in Biomod 2 used the current species’ distributions and their relationships with current climatic variables, and projected these onto the BCC-CSM 1 - 1 and HadGEM 2 -AO climate change scenarios (low and high emissions, 2050 and 2070) in full and no dispersal scenarios.

Only under the no dispersal scenarios did their predicted distributions remain the same as their current distributions. For all non-salmonid species, the most important climate variables in the model predictions related to temperature; for salmonids, they were a combination of temperature and shifts in annual mean precipitation.

The genus has a non-continuous distribution divided by the Bering Strait and the Brooks Range. We examined the distribution of genetic variation across this range to determine the number and location of potential sub-refugia within the greater Beringian refugium as well as the roles of the Bering land bridge, Brooks Range, and large rivers within Beringia in shaping the current distribution of populations of Dallia. Our analyses were based on DNA sequence data from two nuclear gene introns (S 7 and RAG 1) and two mitochondrial genome fragments from nineteen sampling locations. These data were examined under genetic clustering and coalescent frameworks to identify sub-refugia within the greater Beringia refugium and to infer the demographic history of different populations of Dallia.

40|$|Paracoenogonimus ovatus is the {{parasite}} that infest wide definitive host range (predator birds) {{and at least}} two intermediate hosts: molluscs (Viviparus viviparus, V. fasciatus) and freshwater fish from eastern and central Europe. The larvae of {{the parasite}} (metacercariae) go to the muscle and connective tissue, and at high intensity of infection to the internal organs and brain of fish. A total of 128 fishes were caught in autumn 2009 and 2014, by fishing boats operating in Lake Dąbie, {{which is one of the}} largest lakes in Poland. The species selected reflect the species structure of commercial and recreational catches. They were roach, bream, silver bream, crucian carp (Cyprinidae), ruffe, perch, zander (Percidae) and pike (<b>Esocidae).</b> The fish were filleted, and the skinned muscle was compressed under a trichinoscope, what allowed to see and count metacercariae in the tissues. To facilitate parasite isolation from the cysts, the muscle tissues were subjected to a 0. 1 % solution of activated pepsin and 5 % citric acid at a temperature of 20 ºC. The free larvae were measured and identified under an Olympus BX 50 microscope coupled with a camera running AxioVs 40 V 4. 8. 2. 0 software. Metacercariae are grouped primarily at depths ranging from just beneath the skin to about 50 % of fillet thickness. The infection prevalence of P. ovatus metacercariae in the fish analyzed was 78, 5 %. The density of infection per gram of muscle tissue mass in the fish infected was 8. 85 (from 1 to 84 metacercariae). The highest density was noted in roach, bream and white bream (17. 09, 11. 14 and 9. 58, respectively). Metacercariae occurred singly in pike, parasites were not found in the muscles of crucian carp, ruffe, and perch examined. The reason for such differences in infection is the availability and composition of food, as well as the behavior of the fish examined...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to assess {{reference}} values of serum biochemical indices (enzymes, metabolites and minerals) in some representative fish species belonging to Acipenseridae, Cyprinidae, <b>Esocidae</b> and Salmonidae family {{in order to establish}} a baseline data which will serve to monitoring nutritional-metabolic balance and healthy condition of these species from aquatic biocenosis or intensive exploitations. Serum samples were analyzed for glucose, total proteins, albumine, urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, triglycerides, cholesterol, ALT, AST, GGT, alkaline phosphatase, amylase, total bilirubin, Ca, P, Mg, Fe, using a FullyVet automated chemical analyser. The obtained results were compared with those from other papers regarding serum biochemical profile of fresh water fish species. Serum biochemical reference intervals were as follows: glucose, 28. 41 ± 0. 80 – 64. 00 ± 1. 41 mgdL- 1; total proteins, 2. 78 ± 0. 21 - 4. 05 ± 0. 20 gdL- 1; albumine, 0. 67 ± 0. 12 – 1. 59 ± 0. 11 gdL- 1; urea nitrogen, 12. 16 ± 0. 78 – 18. 30 ± 0. 27 mgdL- 1; creatinine, 0. 06 ± 0. 01 – 0. 27 ± 0. 00 mgdL- 1; uric acid, 1. 00 ± 0. 00 – 1. 66 ± 0. 09 mgdL- 1; triglycerides, 46. 00 ± 1. 29 – 351. 3 ± 12. 3 mgdL- 1; cholesterol, 123. 00 ± 2. 12 – 198. 00 ± 0. 91 ±mgdL- 1; ALT, 15. 00 ± 0. 91 – 32. 00 ± 1. 29 IU L- 1; AST, 30. 00 ± 0. 91 – 92. 00 ± 1. 47 IU L- 1; GGT, 4. 00 ± 0. 00 – 6. 33 ± 0. 46 IU L- 1; alkaline phosphatase, 60. 33 ± 1. 20 – 109. 50 ± 3. 05 IU L- 1; amylase, 28. 08 ± 0. 93 – 36. 00 ± 0. 91 IU L- 1; total bilirubin, 0. 00 ± 0. 00 – 0. 03 ± 0. 00 mgdL- 1; Ca, 7. 63 ± 0. 40 – 12. 36 ± 0. 50 mgdL- 1; P, 11. 83 ± 0. 35 - 30. 48 ± 0. 26 mgdL- 1; Mg, 1. 80 ± 0. 14 – 3. 88 ± 0. 21 mgdL- 1; Fe, 57. 60 ± 3. 48 – 120. 00 ± 1. 08 gdL- 1.
