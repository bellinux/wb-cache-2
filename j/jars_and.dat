A row of rooms from an earlier, 1st century BCE to 1st century CE {{fortress}} revealed artefacts pointing to a Nabatæan occupation predating Roman annexation. Coins bearing the likeness of Nabatæan kings were found, along with storage <b>jars</b> <b>and</b> other vessels.|$|E
5|$|The dreaded North Vietnamese wet season {{offensive}} (Campaign Z) {{began on}} 17 December 1971. The multi-division offensive was commanded by Major General Le Trong Tan, who had commanded the PAVN counteroffensive against Operation Lam Son 719. Once again the communists rolled across the Plain of <b>Jars</b> <b>and</b> to {{the outskirts of}} Long Tieng. This time however, they had brought along a battery of 130mm artillery, which proceeded to pummel the defenders. By 17 January 1972, reinforcement by Unity troops and strikes by B-52s had driven the PAVN from the high ground surrounding the valley, but they could not be pushed out of the area. General Tan then shifted the focus of his forces to the southwest and seized Sam Thong on 18 March. The fighting around Long Tieng did not cease until 28 April.|$|E
5|$|The {{eighteenth century}} book {{consists}} {{of a collection of}} letters and essays written by Franklin. Most of the 25 letters in the collection were to Collinson. Some had personal content, but most were about his experiments with electricity and what he had observed from them. These talked about the conclusions he came to after doing scientific experimentation on Leyden <b>jars</b> <b>and</b> lightning storm clouds. He many times related the similarities of how each of these acted and that the principles they followed were identical. This connection ultimately led Franklin to the lightning rod and that the electricity could be diverted harmlessly away from houses and wooden buildings - making it a protection device.|$|E

He drew <b>jars</b> over <b>and</b> over again in his works including <b>Jar</b> <b>and</b> Poetry, White <b>Jar</b> <b>and</b> Woman, <b>Jar,</b> <b>and</b> <b>Jar</b> <b>and</b> Plum Blossoms. His return to Seoul also brought him to teach at the College of Fine Arts, Hongik University, to hold a one-man exhibition at the USIS Gallery, and to be elected {{a member of the}} Korean Academy.|$|R

5|$|The {{economy of}} Springfield is in decline, so Mayor Quimby listens to {{suggestions}} from citizens {{on how to}} improve it. Principal Skinner states that legalized gambling has helped rejuvenate run-down economies, and that it can work for Springfield as well. Everybody, even Marge, likes the idea. Mr. Burns and Mayor Quimby work together to build a casino, where Homer gets a job as a blackjack dealer. The casino is designed by Mr. Burns himself, as the proposals he received were not to his liking. While Marge waits for Homer's shift to end at the casino, she finds a quarter on the floor and uses it to play a slot machine. She wins and almost immediately becomes addicted to gambling. Meanwhile, since Bart is too young to gamble at Mr. Burns' Casino, he starts his own casino for his friends to play in his treehouse, and intercepts Robert Goulet to perform there. Mr. Burns also grows even richer, but in the process becomes a Howard Hughes-type hermit, developing a profound fear of microscopic germs, urinates in <b>jars,</b> <b>and</b> wears tissue boxes instead of shoes.|$|E

25|$|Evidence of {{the first}} human {{inhabitants}} {{in what is now}} Morelos dates back to 6000 BCE and shows these people as nomadic hunters and gatherers in the areas of Yautepec and Chimalacatlan.

Other early finds include clay <b>jars</b> <b>and</b> figures in the Gaulupita neighborhood of Cuernavaca and three mounds in Santa María Ahuacatitlán, which are probably the remains of houses.|$|E

They were written in Kharoṣṭhī and believed to be originally from Afghanistan due to similar birch bark manuscripts that were discovered in eastern Afghanistan.
