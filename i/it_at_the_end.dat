Although many tons of sediments in the area have been {{screened}} for fossils, Afrasia is still known only from four teeth, suggesting that it was a rare species.|$|E

Meanwhile, on 10 and 11 May 1941 the College building was almost consumed by fire, which had already levelled all the buildings to the east of the College on Queen Victoria Street. The building was given up for lost, when a change in the wind saved <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the war, all of the records were returned safely to the College.|$|E

5|$|The unique {{crest of}} Saurolophus {{is made up}} almost {{completely}} by the nasal bones, and in S. angustirostris it is solid.

Thin processes from the frontals and prefrontals extend along the underside of the crest, probably to strengthen <b>it.</b> <b>At</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of the crest is a swelling of the nasal, which is often termed differently.|$|E

5|$|A {{major element}} of the plot {{is based on the}} wuxia film series Palm of Ru Lai (如來神掌), {{released}} in 1964. Sing studied the fighting style used in Palm of Ru Lai ("Buddhist Palm style"), from a young age and used <b>it</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> of Kung Fu Hustle. In reality, the Buddhist Palm fighting style does not leave palm-shaped craters and holes on impact. Instead, the user delivers powerful punches using his palm. The Beast's name in Chinese, Huoyun Xieshen (火雲邪神; Evil Deity of the Fiery Cloud), and the fight with the Landlady and her husband are also references to the Palm of Ru Lai, in which a mortally wounded master strikes the patterns of his art's final techniques into a bell so that his apprentice can learn from it. Kung Fu Hustle also contains direct references to characters from Louis Cha's wuxia novels. For example, the landlord and landlady refer to themselves as Yang Guo and Xiaolongnü, the names of characters in Cha's The Return of the Condor Heroes, when they met the Beast.|$|E
5|$|Charles {{writes a}} love song for Marge, who seems {{completely}} oblivious to him until he tells her {{that he is in}} love with her.

When the two arrive in Springfield, Homer and the children are ecstatic to see Marge. However, Verity has already decided to leave Charles, and has found a new partner: Marge's sister Patty.

25|$|According to Henry, {{life can}} never {{be seen from the}} exterior, as it never appears in the exteriority of the world.
