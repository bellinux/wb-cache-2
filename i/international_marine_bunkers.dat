Here, we revise the energy module to balance the trade flows by recording <b>international</b> <b>marine</b> <b>bunker</b> usage as imports into the country of residence of the ship operator, and as usage by that country’s transport industry. We allocate usage across countries {{in proportion to the}} money value of their water transport services exports. ...|$|R

40|$|This report allocates California&# 39;s 2004 statewide {{carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) {{emissions}} from fuel combustion to the 58 {{counties in the}} state. The total emissions are allocated to counties using several different methods, based {{on the availability of}} data for each sector. Data on natural gas use in all sectors are available by county. Fuel consumption by power and combined heat and power generation plants is available for individual plants. Bottom-up models were used to distribute statewide fuel sales-based CO 2 emissions by county for on-road vehicles, aircraft, and watercraft. All other sources of CO 2 emissions were allocated to counties based on surrogates for activity. CO 2 emissions by sector were estimated for each county, {{as well as for the}} South Coast Air Basin. It is important to note that emissions from some sources, notably electricity generation, were allocated to counties based on where the emissions were generated, rather than where the electricity was actually consumed. In addition, several sources of CO 2 emissions, such as electricity generated in and imported from other states and <b>international</b> <b>marine</b> <b>bunker</b> fuels, were not included in the analysis. California Air Resource Board (CARB) does not include CO 2 emissions from interstate and international air travel, in the official California greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory, so those emissions were allocated to counties for informational purposes only. Los Angeles County is responsible for by far the largest CO 2 emissions from combustion in the state: 83 Million metric tonnes (Mt), or 24 percent of total CO 2 emissions in California, more than twice that of the next county (Kern, with 38 Mt, or 11 percent of statewide emissions). The South Coast Air Basin accounts for 122 MtCO 2, or 35 percent of all emissions from fuel combustion in the state. The distribution of emissions by sector varies considerably by county, with on-road motor vehicles dominating most counties, but large stationary sources and rail travel dominating in other counties. The CO 2 emissions data by county and source are available upon request...|$|R

40|$|Article 2 (2) of the Kyoto Protocol imposes an {{obligation}} only on certain developed countries, {{working through the}} International Maritime Organisation (IMO), to pursue the reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from <b>marine</b> <b>bunker</b> fuels. The IMO recently took the initiative to adopt a new legal instrument for the reduction of ship-generated greenhouse gas emissions. Some developing countries {{have suggested that the}} proposed IMO initiative should strictly adhere to Article 2 (2) of the Kyoto Protocol and the principle of Common but Differentiated Responsibility (CBDR). Against this backdrop, this article intends to review {{the extent to which it}} is possible to propose an international legal instrument for the reduction of GHG emissions from <b>marine</b> <b>bunker</b> fuels which is applicable only to ships from developed countries considering the complex characteristics of the international shipping industry. This article also examines how far this approach is justifiable even within the framework of the CBDR principle. 18 page(s...|$|R
50|$|The Stena Germanica is {{the first}} major marine vessel to run on {{methanol}} after a conversion in 2015 in Poland. Relative to conventional <b>marine</b> <b>bunker</b> fuels, methanol reduces emissions significantly. For reliability purposes, the common rail engine can still run on the marine gas oil as backup. Operation on methanol is expected to reduce SOx emissions by 99%, NOx by 60%, carbon dioxide by 25% and particulate matter by 95%.|$|R
