5000|$|Thomas Lloyd (1756-1827), {{known as}} the “Father of American Shorthand,” was born in London on August 14 to William and Hannah Biddle Lloyd.

Some of his other prominent accomplishments include working for the United States Treasurer and reporting the first Inaugural Address given by George Washington, which was then published in the Gazette of the United States.|$|R
40|$|The {{string of}} Einthoven's string {{galvanometer}} The Dutch physiologist Willem Einthoven (1860 - 1927) published in 1901 his {{construction of a}} string galvanometer. With this apparatus he opened the era for electrocardiography. As {{the quality of his}} instrument largely depended on the string of the string galvanometer it is surprising to note that in his publications Einthoven never mentioned the exact way of producing the string. However, Einthoven's hand written laboratory notes are preserved at the Museum Boerhaave in Leiden. From these notes it comes clear what problems Einthoven had with the string. To get a very thin thread of quarts <b>he</b> <b>first</b> used the <b>method</b> of shooting the thread as was described by Boys (1887), later the blowing method of Nichols (1894). The silvering of the thread was done first chemically, later by cathode spray. In all cases premature breaking of the thread was a nuisance. Because of these failures Einthoven might have decided not to publish any details...|$|R

A method of applying the principles of mement distribution to parabolic arched bents is presented here-in. The primary object has been to plot influence lines for the fixed-end moments, the horizontal reactions, and the vertical reactions at the ends of fixed-arches of any span length and rise/span ratio. These curves were computed by the conjugate structure method of analysis developed by Joseph S. Kinney, D. C. S.; Associate Professor of Structural Engineering, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, N,Y. The authors claim no originality in regard to the concept of applying moment distribution to al'ches since it was recognized by Hardy Cross when <b>he</b> <b>first</b> presented his <b>method,</b> and is the basis of a similar work presented by Cain for one span length only.

40|$|Abstract: Two {{methods of}} {{numerical}} integration of DAE’s using mixed sym-bolic/numerical computations are studied in this paper. The <b>first</b> <b>method,</b> not {{new in the}} literature, is directly obtained by a decoupling and stabilizing control law. Numerical experiments shows that this <b>first</b> <b>method</b> may be numerically unstable for high index systems. The main problem of the <b>first</b> <b>method</b> is that the stabilization of the constraint manifold is the stabilization of a chain of integrators, and this may generate the numerical problems found in the experiments. The second method assures a direct convergence to the constraint manifold, and the numerical experiments show very good results. Copyright c© 2005 IFA...|$|R

40|$|We analyze {{random coding}} error exponents {{associated}} with erasure/list Slepian-Wolf decoding using two different methods and then compare the resulting bounds. The <b>first</b> <b>method</b> follows the well known techniques of Gallager and Forney {{and the second}} method {{is based on a}} technique of distance enumeration, or more generally, type class enumeration, which is rooted in the statistical mechanics of a disordered system that is related to the random energy model (REM). The second method is guaranteed to yield exponent functions which are at least as tight as those of the <b>first</b> <b>method,</b> and it is demonstrated that for certain combinations of coding rates and thresholds, the bounds of the second method are strictly tighter than those of the <b>first</b> <b>method,</b> by an arbitrarily large factor. In fact, the second method may even yield an infinite exponent at regions where the <b>first</b> <b>method</b> gives finite values.
