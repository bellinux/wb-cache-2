50|$|Tungstates occur {{naturally}} with molybdates. Scheelite, {{the mineral}} calcium tungstate, often contains {{a small amount}} of molybdate. Wolframite is manganese and <b>iron</b> <b>tungstate,</b> and all these are valuable sources of tungsten. Powellite is a mineral form of calcium molybdate containing {{a small amount of}} tungstate.|$|E
40|$|International audienceSingle {{crystals}} of lithium <b>iron</b> <b>tungstate,</b> LiFe(WO 4) 2, {{were obtained}} using a high-temperature solution growth method. The {{analysis was conducted}} using the monoclinic space group C 2 /c, with [beta] = 90. 597 (2) °, giving R 1 = 0. 0177. The Li and Fe atoms lie on twofold axes. The structure can also be refined using the orthorhombic space group Cmcm, giving slightly higher residuals. The experimental value of [beta] and the residuals mitigate in favour of the monoclinic description of the structure. Calculated bond-valence sums for the present results are closer to expected values than those obtained using {{the results of a}} previously reported analysis of this structure...|$|E
40|$|<b>Iron</b> <b>tungstate</b> (FeWO$_ 4 $) and {{manganese}} tungstate (MnWO$_ 4 $) {{belong to a}} family of wolframite-type materials that has applications in various areas, including supercapacitors, batteries, and multiferroics. A detailed understanding of bulk properties and defect physics in these transition-metal tungstates has been lacking, however, impeding possible improvement of their functional properties. Here, we report a first-principles study of FeWO$_ 4 $ and MnWO$_ 4 $ using screened hybrid density-functional calculations. We find that in both compounds the electronic structure near the band edges are predominantly the highly localized transition-metal $d$ states, which allows {{for the formation of}} both hole polarons at the Fe (Mn) sites and electron polarons at the W sites. The dominant native point defects in FeWO$_ 4 $ (MnWO$_ 4 $) under realistic synthesis conditions are, however, the hole polarons at the Fe (Mn) sites and negatively charged Fe (Mn) vacancies. The presence of low-energy and highly mobile polarons provides explanation for the good p-type conductivity observed in experiments and the ability of the materials to store energy via a pseudocapacitive mechanism.

50|$|Wolframite, (Fe,Mn)WO4, is an <b>iron</b> {{manganese}} <b>tungstate</b> mineral that is {{the intermediate}} between ferberite (Fe2+ rich) and hübnerite (Mn2+ rich). Along with scheelite, the wolframite series {{are the most important}} tungsten ore minerals. Wolframite is found in quartz veins and pegmatites associated with granitic intrusives. Associated minerals include cassiterite, scheelite, bismuth, quartz, pyrite, galena, sphalerite, and arsenopyrite.|$|R
40|$|The RpoE and CpxR {{regulated}} envelope stress {{responses are}} extremely important for Salmonella Typhimurium to cause infection {{in a range}} of hosts. Until now the role for BaeSR in both the Salmonella Typhimurium response to stress and its contribution to infection have not been fully elucidated. Here we demonstrate stationary phase growth, <b>iron</b> and sodium <b>tungstate</b> as novel inducers of the BaeRregulon, with BaeR critically required for Salmonella resistance to sodium tungstate. We show that functional overlap between the resistance nodulation-cell division (RND) multidrug transporters, MdtA, AcrD and AcrB exists for the waste disposal of tungstate from the cell. We also point to a role for enterobactinsiderophores in the protection of enteric organisms from tungstate, akin to the scenario in nitrogen fixing bacteria. Surprisingly, BaeR is the first envelope stress response pathway investigated in S. Typhimurium that is not required for murine typhoid in either ity(S) or ity(R) mouse backgrounds. BaeR is therefore either required for survival in larger mammals such as pigs or calves, an avian host such as chickens, or survival out with the host altogether where Salmonella and related enterics must survive in soil and water...|$|R
40|$|This {{communication}} {{is a report}} of our initial research to obtain <b>iron</b> <b>tungstate</b> (FeWO 4) nanocrystals by the microwave-hydrothermal method at 170 degrees C for 45 min. X-ray diffraction patterns showed that the FeWO 4 nanocrystals prepared with polyethylene glycol- 200 have a partial preferential orientation in the (011) plane {{in relation to other}} nanocrystals prepared with sodium bis(2 -ethylhexyl) sulfosuccinate and water. Rietveld refinement data indicates that all nanocrystals are monophasic with wolframite-type monoclinic structures and exhibit different distortions on octahedral [FeO 6]/[WO 6] clusters. High resolution transmission electron microcopy revealed an oriented attachment mechanism for the growth of aggregated FeWO 4 nanocrystals. Finally, we observed that the photoluminescence properties of these nanocrystals are affected by partial preferential orientation in the (011) plane and distortions on [FeO 6]/[WO 6] clusters.
