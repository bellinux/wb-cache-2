40|$|An organic Rankine cycle (ORC) {{is often}} used in waste heat {{recovery}} applications. These are typically small-scale applications where cycle thermal efficiency is low, {{and the benefits of}} traditional cycle enhancements (such as reheat stages or feed-water heaters) do not typically outweigh the costs required to implement them. An ORC with flooded expansion and <b>internal</b> heat <b>regeneration</b> is an alternative enhancement that provides comparable benefits at reduced cost and complexity. The improvement in efficiency for the ORC with flooded expansion and <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration</b> is analyzed for several working fluids and for two flooding media: water and Zerol 60 compressor lubricant. It is shown that <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration</b> alone provides most of the efficiency enhancement for dry working fluids (R 600 a, n-Pentane, and R 245 fa). n-Pentane is shown to offer the most efficient cycle even without flooded expansion in most cases. A quantitative comparison is given between the proposed cycle and the reheat and feedwater heater cycles with <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration.</b> In applications where a hydrocarbon may not be appropriate as a working fluid, R 245 fa and R 717 show promise as alternatives. R 717, which shows the most benefit from flooded expansion and <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration,</b> requires this enhancement in order to be competitive with the dry working fluids...|$|R

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2014 Eutrophication, a {{state in}} which {{a body of water}} becomes over-enriched with nutrients, remains one of the biggest water quality {{problems}} both in the United States and globally. Although nutrient pollution that causes eutrophication is regulated in the United States under the Clean Water Act (CWA), eutrophication remains a significant threat. Continued land-use change, <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration</b> of nutrients, and climate change all continue to contribute to nutrient loads that lead to eutrophication. This thesis is comprised of two chapters that aim to address the interplay between external and internal nutrient sources in lakes in the face of climate change. In the first chapter I examine how climate change impacts the internal nutrient cycling in two neighboring lakes in western Washington (USA). I found that climate variability can drive the <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration</b> of phosphorus in lakes that exhibit summer anoxia. This implies that climate change has the potential to increase nutrient loads in highly productive lakes, thereby increasing the risk of eutrophication in these systems in spite of control on external nutrient inputs. In the second chapter, I review the Clean Water Act and the policy tools implemented under it by which we manage external nutrient inputs. I found that the Clean Water Act is very good at addressing easy-to-identify point sources of nutrient pollution, but is much less effective at addressing diffuse, nonpoint sources. These results suggest that in order to maintain acceptable water quality in the future, we may need to be more aggressive with nonpoint source pollution that we currently are, particularly for productive lakes that exhibit summer anoxia. This information may also help managers allocate resources for nutrient control and identify lakes that are particularly at risk of eutrophication into the future...|$|R
40|$|Supercriticalheat-pumpcycles {{suited for}} {{high-temperature}} heat generation {{and in which}} heat is delivered {{in the form of}} sensible heat of a high-pressure fluid are examined and their energy performance is evaluated. The main variables governing the energy efficiency of the process and the temperatures of the heat produced are recognized to be the fluid critical temperature, the molecular complexity, the top cycle pressure and the amount of <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration</b> of heat. Two cycle configurations are examined: one featuring fluid compression after a regenerative preheating and one that also includes turbine expansion of a fraction of the high-pressure fluid in order to achieve a more effective regeneration. General diagrams giving the operating characteristics of a supercriticalheat-pumpcycle for any kind of fluid are reported. Some fluids are presented (SF 6, C 3 F 8, C 2 HF 5, c-C 4 F 8), which exhibit a high level of thermal stability and are thermodynamically suitable for supercriticalcycles: for each one a detailed performance chart is given. An example application in which a conventional high-temperature cycle is compared with two supercritical solutions is presented. The following conclusions summarize the findings of the thermodynamic analysis. (1) In supercriticalcycles high heat-output temperatures are achievable with moderate compressor pressure ratios and with a comparatively simple cycle arrangement, while conventional cycles require a large pressure ratio and a complex cycle organization. Sub-atmospheric pressures, which may be required in conventional cycles, can be avoided. (2) As heat is available in supercriticalcycles within a certain temperature range, applications implying the use of heat at variable temperature could benefit from the natural matching between temperature availability and process requirements. (3) The comparatively high pressures at which heat is produced in supercriticalcycles could represent a drawback for small-capacity plants but are probably acceptable or even beneficial for large systems. (4) The <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration</b> of a sizeable amount of heat, which is requested in supercriticalcycles, represents a definite cost item for this type of heatpump...|$|R

Before {{he reached}} his teens, his {{inherited}} powers began to manifest but brought with them clonal degeneration. Kaine, the degenerated first clone of Peter Parker, found him, and placed him within a <b>regeneration</b> <b>tank</b> to slow the process.

40|$|Uptake {{rates of}} ammonium, nitrate and urea were {{measured}} during the spring, summer and autumn (2001) in the eutrophic, nitrogen (N) limited Neuse River Estuary (NRE), North Carolina, USA. Ammonium was the dominant form of N taken {{up during the}} study, contributing {{approximately half of the}} total measured N uptake throughout the estuary. Nitrate uptake declined significantly with distance downstream comprising 33 % of the total uptake in the upper estuary but only 11 and 16 % in the middle and lower estuary, respectively. Urea uptake contributed least to the total pool in the upper estuary (16 %), but increased in importance in the middle and lower estuary, comprising 45 and 37 % of the total N taken up, respectively. The importance of regenerated N for fuelling phytoplankton productivity in the mesohaline sections of the NRE is demonstrated. The contribution of urea to the regenerated N pool suggests that <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration</b> of dissolved organic N may support {{a large proportion of the}} phytoplankton primary production and biomass accumulation in the middle and lower NRE.

This site provides an ideal field {{environment in which}} to test our understanding of Fe isotope fractionations derived from laboratory experiments. The Fe(III) oxides, mainly produced through Fe(II) oxidation by oxygen in the atmosphere, have high 56 Fe/ 54 Fe ratios compared with the aqueous Fe(II). However, the degree of fractionation is less than that expected in a closed system at isotopic equilibrium. We suggest two explanations for the observed Fe isotope compositions. One is that light Fe isotopes partition into a sorbed component and precipitate out on the Fe(III) oxide surfaces {{in the presence of}} silica. The other explanation is <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration</b> of isotopically heavy Fe(II) via dissimilatory Fe(III) reduction farther down the flow path as well as deeper within the mat materials.

40|$|Heatpumps {{based on}} the {{reversed}} Stirlingcycle are shown to be positively influenced by realgas effects, provided {{they are designed to}} operate in a proper region of the fluid state diagram. A simplified model of a Stirlingheatpump, aimed at understanding the basic cycle thermodynamics is presented, which allows a first optimization of realgascycles. Provided the expansion process takes place in a proper narrow region close to the critical point, efficiencies much higher than those achievable with an ideal gas and similar to those of vaporization-compression cycles are obtained. A number of zero ODP, safe fluids are considered (Xe, CHF 3, C 2 F 6, CHF 3 + CF 4 mixtures) allowing optimum operation {{in a wide range of}} heat source and heat production temperatures. Only mixtures, however, are recognized to permit a fine adjustment of the fluid properties to the heat source characteristics and to the user's temperature requirements. In order to reach good energy performance, high-pressure operation (around 200 bar) and an efficient <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration</b> of heat are needed. Graphs are supplied that reveal the heatpumpcycleperformance for each fluid at a wide range of temperatures, pressures and cycle compression volume ratios. Loss analysis shows that fluids having a simple molecule yield the best efficiency and the minimum amount of heat regeneration. Stirling power cycles are also shown to benefit from realgas effects, with the result that at top temperatures around 400 – 450 °C, which are probably acceptable for a number of organic fluids, a fuel to work conversion efficiency around 25 – 30 % seems possible for a cogenerative prime mover. The performance of such motors, intended for heatpump drives, are given for C 2 HF 5 and C 3 F 8 fluids. Very high pressures are required to optimize the cycleperformance.

30|$|Whole-cell {{biocatalysts}} are {{beneficial in}} the biotransformation {{involved in their}} <b>internal</b> cofactor <b>regeneration</b> and in bioconversions requiring multi-step metabolic pathways. Whole-cell biocatalysts are available in two-phase systems consisting of organic solvent and an aqueous medium, that are potentially advantageous for the bioconversion of hydrophobic and/or toxic organic compounds (Schmid et al. 1998;Sardessai and Bhosle 2004; Heipieper et al. 2007). The use of a second organic phase improves productivity levels and product recovery, unlike the case with conventional media whose substrate solubility is poor. One of the main limitations {{in the application of}} whole-cell biocatalysts in two-phase systems is the instability of biocatalysts due to the toxicity of organic solvents toward the cells. When microorganisms are incubated {{in the presence of a}} large amount of an organic solvent, the extent of growth inhibition is inversely correlated with the log POW of the solvent (Inoue and Horikoshi 1989). Hydrophobic organic solvents with a log POW of 2 to 5 bind to the cells and disrupt the cell membrane (Sikkema et al. 1994; Aono et al. 1994).|$|R

40|$|Maritime {{transportation}} {{is a significant}} contributor to So x, NO xand particle matter emissions, {{even though it has}} a quite low CO 2 impact. New regulations are being enforced in special areas that limit the amount of emissions from the ships. This fact, together with the high fuel prices, is driving the marine industry towards the improvement of the energy efficiency of current ship engines and the reduction of their energy demand. Although more sophisticated and complex engine designs can improve significantly the efficiency of the energy systems in ships, waste heat recovery arises as the most influent technique for the reduction of the energy consumption. In this sense, it is estimated that around 50 % of the total energy from the fuel consumed in a ship is wasted and rejected in fluid and exhaust gas streams. The primary heat sources for waste heat recovery are the engine exhaust and the engine coolant. In this work, we present a study on the integration of an organic Rankine cycle (ORC) in an existing ship, for the recovery of the main and auxiliary engines exhaust heat. Experimental data from the operating conditions of the engines on the M/S Birka Stockholm cruise ship were logged during a port-to-port cruise from Stockholm to Mariehamn {{over a period of time}} close to one month. The ship has four main engines Wärtsilä 5850 kW for propulsion, and four auxiliary engines 2760 kW used for electrical consumers. A number of six load conditions were identified depending on the vessel speed. The speed range from 12 - 14 knots was considered as the design condition, as it was present during more than 34 % of the time. In this study, the average values of the engines exhaust temperatures and mass flow rates, for each load case, were used as inputs for a model of an ORC. The main parameters of the ORC, including working fluid and turbine configuration, were optimized based on the criteria of maximum net power output and compactness of the installation components. Results from the study showed that an ORC with <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration</b> using benzene would yield the greatest average net power output over the operating time. For this situation, the power production of the ORC would represent about 22 % of the total electricity consumption on board.

The FDM, therefore, is able to catalyze redox reactions independent of exogenous cofactor addition, rendering the enzyme powerful for industrial applications. Currently, only one enzyme of this type has been characterized enzymatically. Furthermore, only one additional DNA-sequence with high homology to FDM has been published. In this work, we identified a new variant of a formaldehyde dismutase gene (fdm) in the Pseudomonas putida J 3 strain. To isolate and characterize the enzyme, we developed a simplified method for its purification. This purification is based on a C-terminal 6 xHis-tag, which enables functional expression of the enzyme in E. coli and a one-step purification method. In addition, we tested several expression systems for optimal yields and combined this with co-expression of the chaperonins GroESL. Using this simplified and rapid method, we are now able to produce sufficient material in reproducible quality and quantity for application tests with the enzyme.

Methods: The cryopolymers of polyvinyl alcohol, poly-HEMA, fibrinogen, collagen and gelatin were synthesized in aqueous solutions at temperatures below 273 K. The ice crystals were used as a pore-forming substance and the procedure led to formation of robust macroporous polymer structures capable of retaining their integrity upon multiple hydration-dehydration cycles. The pore structure of cryopolymers was characterized using cryo-NMR, confocal laser scanning microscopy, m-CT and SEM.

The present review highlights biotechnological processes for the production of chiral alcohols by reducing prochiral ketones with whole cells. Microbial transformations feature different characteristics in comparison to isolated enzymes.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to present the close, according to the Platonic view, connection between ethics, education and politics and the crucial role of the governors on the reconstruction of their own states through the adoption by them unvarying values and the transmission of these values to their fellow citizens through education. The design of the thesis was based on careful study of Platonic texts, comparative co-examination of certain platonic points with relative positions of other intellectuals of antiquity and the thorough evaluative study of the extensive, relating to the political and ethical views of Plato, bibliography. Our final positions are obtained by inductive way and developed in causal analysis of the arguments underlying, in order to reflect their diversity in relation to views of other scholars. The thesis consists of three parts. The first of these, entitled “Laws and governors in Plato’s thought” occurs initially the importance of law, the impersonal institution of ratio, to the historical society, {{as the most important}} regulator of social stability and as the most comprehensive ethical and educational code of the social members. Next, the ideal solution, according to Plato, concerning the governance of states, is presented. It is emphasized that this ideal leader, due to his unique intellectual and moral superiority, unity and importance, is becoming the excellent guardian of the proper social partnership and the guarantor of uplifting life individually and collectively. The second part, entitled “Education as the primary concern of the legislature”, focuses on the presentation of the redemptive power of education, which, in our opinion, restores the proximity of people to the supernatural element of harmony, of ratio and of bliss, redefines the values of life and allows the building of a decent individual and collective life, based on moral and rational spirituality that education develops and for this reason is needed to become the most important of the concerns of the leaders. The third part refers to the “Educated citizens”, the fertile product of educational effort. This <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration,</b> as it is pointed out, becomes the basis for the removal of power-loving selfish tendencies and the precedency of general benefit. Thus, the mature sociability of the citizens, their continuous emulation to virtue, the commitment of each to an appropriate, in its own nature function, as the result of education, lay the foundation for building a state of measure, harmony, honor and internal unity. In conclusion, this thesis argues as timeless debt of politicians their realization that the suffering of the states and the collective and individual salvation depends on their moral decency and the transfusion of indestructible importance principles to their fellow citizens, in order to achieve, according to the exemplary model of cosmic harmony, genuine social symmetry, justice and happiness. ...|$|R

40|$|The energy {{efficiency}} of membrane distillation (MD) systems is low {{when compared to}} other thermal desalination systems. This leads to high water production costs when conventional fuels such as natural gas are used. In MD, separation of pure product water from feedwater is driven by differences in vapor pressure between the streams. Thus, the process can occur at low temperature and ambient pressure. As a result, MD is most frequently paired with waste or renewable sources of low temperature heat energy that can be economically more feasible. MD systems with <b>internal</b> heat <b>regeneration</b> have been compared to and modeled similar to counter-flow heat exchangers. In this study, MD is used to replace the preheater heat exchanger used for thermal energy recovery from the brine stream in mechanical vapor compression (MVC). Using MD in place of the heat exchanger results not only in effectively free thermal energy for MD, but also subsidized cost of capital, since the MD module is replacing expensive heat exchanger equipment. The MVC–MD hybrid system can lead to about 6 % decrease in cost of water, compared to a stand-alone MVC system. The savings increase with: an increase in MVC operating temperature, a decrease in MVC recovery ratio, and with a decrease in MD capital cost.

40|$|Production of {{high-quality}} syngas from biomass gasification in a dual fluidised bed gasifier (DFBG) {{has made a}} significant progress in R&D and Technology demonstration. An S&M scale bio-automotive fuel plant close to the feedstock resources is preferable as biomass feedstock is widely sparse and has relatively low density, low heating value and high moisture content. This requires simple, reliable and cost-effective production of clean and good syngas. Indirect DFBGs, with steam as the gasification agent, produce a syngas of high content H 2 and CO with 12 - 20 MJ/mn 3 heating value. The Mid Sweden University (MIUN) gasifier, built for research on synthetic fuel production, is a dual fluidised bed gasifier. Reforming of tars and CH 4 (except for methanation application) in the syngas is a major challenge for commercialization of biomass fluidised-bed gasification technology towards automotive fuel production. A good syngas from DFBGs {{can be obtained by}} optimised design and operation of the gasifier, by the use of active catalytic bed material and internal reforming. This thesis presents a series of experimental tests with different operation parameters, reforming of tar and CH 4 with catalytic bed material and reforming of tar and CH 4 with catalytic internal reformer.   The first test was carried out to evaluate the optimal operation and performance of the MIUN gasifier. The test provides basic information for temperature control in the combustor and the gasifier by the bed material circulation rate.    After proven operation and performance of the MIUN gasifier, an experimental study on in-bed material catalytic reforming of tar/CH 4 is performed to evaluate the catalytic effects of the olivine and Fe-impregnated olivine (10 %wtFe/olivine Catalyst) bed materials, with reference to non-catalytic silica sand operated in the mode of dual fluidised beds (DFB). A comparative experimental test is then carried out with the same operation condition and bed-materials but when the gasifier was operated in the mode of single bubbling fluidised bed (BFB). The behaviour of catalytic and non-catalytic bed materials differs when they are used in the DFB and the BFB. Fe/olivine and olivine in the BFB mode give lower tar and CH 4 content together with higher H 2 +CO concentration, and higher H 2 /CO ratio, compared to DFB mode. It is hard to show a clear advantage of Fe/olivine over olivine regarding tar/CH 4 catalytic reforming.     In order to significantly reduce the tar/CH 4 contents, an internal reformer, referred to as the FreeRef reformer, is developed for in-situ catalytic reforming of tar and CH 4 using Ni-catalyst in an environment of good gas-solids contact at high temperature.  A study on the internal reformer filled with and without Ni-catalytic pellets was carried out by evaluation of the syngas composition and tar/CH 4 content. It can be concluded that the reformer with Ni-catalytic pellets clearly gives a higher H 2 content together with lower CH 4 and tar contents in the syngas than the reformer without Ni-catalytic pellets. The gravimetric tar content decreases from 25 g/m 3 down to 5 g/m 3 and the CH 4 content from 11 % down below 6 % in the syngas.   The MIUN gasifier has a unique design suitable for in-bed tar/CH 4 catalytic reforming and continuously <b>internal</b> <b>regeneration</b> of the reactive bed material. The novel design in the MIUN gasifier increases the gasification efficiency, suppresses the tar generation and upgrades the syngas composition.    Gasification-based Biorefinery for Mechanical Pulp Mill...|$|R

In particular, bismuth (III) oxide has been used in hydraulic silicate cements (HSC), originally in [...] "MTA" [...] (a trade name, standing for the chemically-meaningless [...] "mineral trioxide aggregate") from 10 to 20% by mass with a mixture of mainly di- and tri-calcium silicate powders. Such HSC is used for dental treatments such as: apicoectomy, apexification, pulp capping, pulpotomy, pulp <b>regeneration,</b> <b>internal</b> repair of iatrogenic perforations, repair of resorption perforations, root canal sealing and obturation. MTA sets into a hard filling material when mixed with water. Some resin-based materials also include an HSC with bismuth oxide. Problems have allegedly arisen with bismuth oxide because it is claimed not to be inert at high pH, specifically that it slows the setting of the HSC, but also over time can lose color by exposure to light or reaction with other materials that may have been used in the tooth treatment, such as sodium hypochlorite.|$|R
40|$|Direct fired {{coal power}} {{stations}} exhibit a comparatively poor performance since they cannot be operated in a combined cycle. A liquid metal topping cycle could dramatically improve their overall conversion efficiency. The high temperature required poses demanding technical problems {{both in the}} primary heat exchanger and in the turbine. The present paper discusses the possibility of alleviating the turbine-related problems {{through the use of}} an ejector which transfers the energy produced in a metal vapour topping cycle to a helium-vapour mixture at much lower temperature and pressure. Ejector performance is analysed both from a mechanical and from a thermodynamic point of view. Three typical alkali metal fluids are examined: sodium, potassium and cesium. The efficiency of the energy transfer from vapour to helium significantly increases with the metal molecular weight and attains optimum values of around 90 per cent. Turbine inlet temperature reduction due to the ejector action is about 500 K. Important gains are also the reduction in turbine inlet pressure and expansion ratio. After the energy transfer to helium and the turbine expansion, metal vapour and inert gas are separated by vapour condensation at a decreasing temperature. Such cooling represents the main thermodynamic loss in the process. At a maximum temperature of 1500 K and a condensation temperature for the reference vapour cycle of 950 K, computed efficiencies of the ejector-assisted topping cycle are in the range 17 – 19 per cent, as against pure vapour cycle efficiencies in the range 24 – 26 per cent. The strong cooling of the mixture needed to separate the liquid metal implies a significant increase in heat consumption which can be mitigated by means of an <b>internal</b> heat <b>regeneration,</b> which improves cycle efficiency to 19 – 22 per cent. With reference to a standard steam bottoming cycle, and including electrical, mechanical and boiler losses, plant efficiencies of around 50 per cent seem achievable...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe sea cucumber, Holothuria glaberrima, has the {{capacity}} to regenerate its <b>internal</b> organs. Intestinal <b>regeneration</b> is accomplished by the thickening of the mesenteric border and the invasion of this thickening by mucosal epithelium from the esophagus and the cloaca. Extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling has been associated with morphogenetic events during embryonic development and regeneration. We have used immunohistochemical techniques against ECM components to show that differential changes occur in the ECM during early regeneration. Labeling of fibrous collagenous components and muscle-related laminin disappear from the regenerating intestine and mesentery, while fibronectin labeling and 4 G 7 (an echinoderm ECM component) are continuously present. Western blots confirm a decrease in fibrous collagen content during the first 2 weeks of regeneration. We have also identified five 1, 10 -phenanthroline-sensitive bands in collagen gelatin zymographs. The gelatinolytic activities of these bands are enhanced during early stages of regeneration, suggesting that the metalloprotease activity is associated with ECM remodeling. Inhibition of MMPs in vivo with 1, 10 -phenanthroline, p-aminobenzoyl-Gly-Pro-D-Leu-D-Ala hydroxamate or N-CBZ-Pro-Leu-Gly hydroxamate produces a reversible inhibition of intestinal regeneration and ECM remodeling. Our results show that significant changes in ECM content occur during intestine regeneration in the sea cucumber and that the onset of these changes is correlated to the proteolytic activities of MMPs...|$|R
50|$|The hydra and the planarian flatworm {{have long}} served as model organisms for their highly {{adaptive}} regenerative capabilities. Once wounded, their cells become activated {{and start to}} remodel tissues and organs back to the pre-existing state. The Caudata ("urodeles"; salamanders and newts), an order of tailed amphibians, is possibly the most adept vertebrate group at regeneration, given their capability of regenerating limbs, tails, jaws, eyes {{and a variety of}} <b>internal</b> structures. The <b>regeneration</b> of organs is a common and widespread adaptive capability among metazoan creatures. In a related context, some animals are able to reproduce asexually through fragmentation, budding, or fission. A planarian parent, for example, will constrict, split in the middle, and each half generates a new end to form two clones of the original. Echinoderms (such as the starfish), crayfish, many reptiles, and amphibians exhibit remarkable examples of tissue regeneration. The case of autotomy, for example, serves as a defensive function as the animal detaches a limb or tail to avoid capture. After the limb or tail has been autotomized, cells move into action and the tissues will regenerate. Limited regeneration of limbs occurs in most fishes and salamanders, and tail regeneration takes place in larval frogs and toads (but not adults). The whole limb of a Salamander or a Triton will grow again and again after amputation. In reptiles, Chelonians, crocodiles and snakes are unable to regenerate lost parts, but many (not all) kinds of lizards, geckos and Iguanas possess regeneration capacity in a high degree. Usually, it involves dropping a section of their tail and regenerating it as part of a defense mechanism. While escaping a predator, if the predator catches the tail, it will disconnect.|$|R
40|$|This study {{documented}} the macroalgal assemblages of the Swan-Canning Estuarine System (SCES) over a two year period, and {{the influences of}} several environmental parameters on the assemblages. In addition, the Impacts of unattached macroalgal accumulations on benthic nutrient fluxes and microbial communities were investigated. Benthic macroalgal assemblages and physico-chemical regimes were monitored in the SCES, to determine temporal and spatial changes in macroalgal communities {{and the influence of}} environmental factors in these changes. Physico-chemical regimes demonstrated strong seasonal changes, which revolved around the onset and cessation of freshwater flows in winter (May to September). In the months after freshwater flows, strong spatial variability in physico-chemical profiles was observed. However, by summer the system was essentially marine. Macroalgal biomass and species richness was lowest in winter. Species number was maximal during periods of greatest hydrological variability in the estuary (spring and autumn). It may be inferred from results of statistical analyses that substrate type (i. e. hard/soft) and waterflow were the most Influential factors over temporal and spatial distribution of macroalgal species in the SCES. These factors ware reflected by the patchiness of macroalgal distribution in the system- attached macroalgal species distributed unevenly according to availability of limited hard substrate and presence/absence of unattached macroalgal species corresponding to seasonal freshwater flows. One species, Gracileria comosa, dominated macroalgal biomass and was the most widespread species and commonly occurred as extensive, unattached accumulations. As G. comosa was the most abundant unattached macroalga, accumulations of this species were investigated to determine the characteristics and behaviour or accumulations in the Swan-Canning Estuarine System. Accumulations were characterised by seasonally measuring height and biomass of accumulations in three regions or the estuarine system over one year. The height of accumulations was generally between 5 and 25 cm, regardless of water depth, location, or season. Biomass was highly variable, but generally between 100 and 500 dw/m 2. The persistence of macroalgal accumulations was monitored at 28 sites within 10 estuarine regions, over a three month period, during which the first freshwater flows were recorded. Accumulations persisted between one week and one month, depending on the region, with accumulations persisting for longer periods in areas of low flow such as embayments and the regulated Canning River, and for shorter periods In regions of higher flow such as the channalised Swan River. Field and laboratory studies were performed to determine If the presence of G. comosa accumulations had an Impact on sediment-water nutrient exchange. Field studies established that accumulations affected benthic nutrient fluxes within a 24 hour period. However, this effect was site-dependent, occurring at an estuarine site of relatively high sediment organic content, but not at a site of relatively low sediment organic. Diurnal changes in water quality inside algal accumulations corresponded to photosynthetic/respiratory activity of the macroalgae - most notably, Increases In orthophosphate and ammonium fluxes from the sediment after approximately 8 h of darkness. Since this effect was on time scales less than the period of persistence (weeks to months), It was concluded that macroalgal accumulations have an impact on benthic nutrient fluxes from sediments of relatively high organic content in the system. Laboratory studies investigated the effect of depth and density of an algal layer on sediment- water nutrient exchange. The experimental results concurred with field observations; water column concentrations of inorganic nutrients were significantly higher in sediment cores overlain by an algal layer over a 7 day period. In addition, Inorganic nutrient concentrations increased With Increasing height of the layer and ammonium concentrations increased with increasing density of the algal layer. Additional laboratory experiments tested the effect of an algal layer on sediment denitrification rates, and the composition and distribution of benthic microbial populations, Benthic nitrogen (N 2) release rates were low irrespective of the presence of macroalgae and sediment types (less than 1 mmo N/m 2 /d). However, release rates were significantly higher in sediment cores covered by algae than in comparable bare sediment cores, provided the algal layer was relatively high (5 cm in height} and sediment organic content was high. The presence of an algal layer did not {{have a significant effect on}} the composition or distribution of microbes in the sediment. In all cases, microbial populations contained relatively few denitrifiers/nitrate reducers compared to nitrifiers and ammonifiers. High ammonium release rates from the sediment to the water column, and the low release rates of elemental nitrogen, suggested that even II the nitrate reducing bacteria were active they were not reducing nitrate to nitrogen, suggesting the possibility of Dissimilatory Nitrate Reduction to Ammonium (DNRA). Subsequent analysis confirmed that the nitrate reducers were reducing nitrate to nitrite, a result compatible with the hypothesis that the main microbial processes occurring were ammonification, nitrification, and DNRA, but not denitrification. These processes, regardless of the presence of a benthic algal layer, contribute to high ammonium flux rates from the sediment and provide a mechanism of <b>internal</b> inorganic nitrogen <b>regeneration.</b> In conclusion, this study has established that unattached macroalgal accumulations are a prominent component of the macroatgal community in the Swan-Canning Estuarine System. Accumulations may remain within an estuarine region for up to one month, particularly in regions of low water flow. In seasons and regions of relatively high water flows (e. g. the Swan River), accumulations become highly transient, if present at all. At times, and in regions where they may persist, algal accumulations of 5 cm or more in depth have an impact on benthic nutrient fluxes. In particular, their presence over sediments of high organic content appears to exacerbate the release of ammonium from the sediment to the overlying water column. Of note, the benthic process Dissimilatory Nitrate Reduction to Ammonium appears to dominate in summer while denitrification rates are minimal, regardless of the presence of a macroagal layer. From these findings, it is recommended that high fluxes of ammonium in the system be recognised In water quality management and nutrient budgets for the system, as It appears that <b>Internal</b> ammonium <b>regeneration</b> Is a large source of Inorganic nitrogen for organisms In the overlying water body, and may support algal blooms In summer. In addition, it appears that the most appropriate method of managing macroalgal distribution and biomass in the system is ensuring strong freshwater flushes during winter periods when macroalgal biomass is largely removed. If seasonal flushes were inhibited, it is predicted that macroalgal biomass and distribution would increase, extending the period that thsy can influence benthic nutrient cycles. The physical removal of macroalgae as a management option in such a scenario would require much time and effort, as the Swan-Canning Estuarine System is such a large system, and macroalgae are spread throughout. Therefore, in modifying river flows into the estuarine system, the quantity, composition and distribution of macroalgae, and possibly other flora and fauna, will be altered. This is already evident in the Canning River, which is regulated and suffers management problems, such as altered species composition, bathymetric changes, toxic algal blooms, and eutrophication...|$|R
