40|$|Abstract — Mobile Ad Hoc Network is a {{collection}} of mobile nodes forming an ad hoc network without the assistance of any centralized structures. There are many algorithms to improve <b>data</b> <b>accessibility</b> and reduce delay in MANETs. The basic idea is to distributively group mobile nodes with similar mobility pattern into a cluster, which can then interchangeably share their resources for overhead reduction and load balancing, aiming to achieve efficient and scalable routing in MANET. Due to lack of continues communication Distributed Adaptive Clustering Algorithm (DACA) is proposed to further improve the performance of <b>data</b> <b>accessibility</b> and reduce delay. The experimental results in the NS- 2 simulation environment demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves higher delivery ratio and significantly lower overhead compared with its non-clustering counterpart.

30|$|A {{main concern}} {{regarding}} using crowdsourced datasets such as OpenStreetMap {{is the level}} of quality they carry [20]. Several methods exists in assessing VGI data quality [21]. Among the studies carried out on using VGI <b>data</b> for urban <b>accessibility,</b> some of them evaluate, argue and enrich the fitness for purpose of this data source [22 – 24]. For instance, Mobasheri et, al. [23] evaluates the completeness of sidewalk information (as well as other relevant <b>data</b> for <b>accessibility)</b> in OpenStreetMap database and discusses the lack of data completeness with applying extrinsic and intrinsic data analysis. Wheelmap, among other possibilities, can be used by volunteers to enrich accessibility information in OpenStreetMap. Wheelmap has had a great influence in research projects. Several studies have used or cited Wheelmap as one of the main crowdsourcing platforms in the accessibility domain [18, 19, 25 – 31]. Hence, this study aims to introduce this platform for a better understanding and usage in future studies.|$|R

40|$|A mobile ad hoc network (MANET) is a {{collection}} of wireless mobile nodes that forms a temporary network without the aid of a fixed communication infrastructure. Since every node can be mobile and network topology changes can occur frequently, node disconnection is a common mode of operation in MANETs. Providing reliable data access and message delivery is a challenge in this dynamic network environment. Caching and replica allocation within the network can improve <b>data</b> <b>accessibility</b> by storing the data and accessing them locally. However, maintaining data consistency among replicas becomes a challenging problem. Hence, balancing <b>data</b> <b>accessibility</b> and consistency is an important step toward data management in MANETs. In this paper, we propose a replica-based data-storage mechanism and undelivered-message queue schemes to provide reliable data storage and dissemination. We also propose replica update strategies to maintain data consistency while improving <b>data</b> <b>accessibility.</b> These solutions are based on a clustered MANET where nodes in the network are divided into small groups that are suitable for localized data management. The goal is to reduce communication overhead, support localized computation, and enhance scalability. A simulation environment was built using an NS- 2 network simulator to evaluate the performance of the proposed schemes. The results show that our schemes distribute replicas effectively, provide high <b>data</b> <b>accessibility</b> rates and maintain consistency...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—This paper {{analyzes}} different {{techniques of}} the fine grained security of relational databases for the two variables-data accessibility and inference. <b>Data</b> <b>accessibility</b> measures the amount of data available to the users after applying a security technique on a table. Inference is the proportion of information leakage after suppressing a cell containing secret data. A row containing a secret cell which is suppressed can become a security threat if an intruder generates useful information from the related visible information of the same row. This paper measures <b>data</b> <b>accessibility</b> and inference associated with row, cell, and column level security techniques. Cell level security offers greatest <b>data</b> <b>accessibility</b> as it suppresses secret data only. But on the other hand, {{there is a high}} probability of inference in cell level security. Row and column level security techniques have least <b>data</b> <b>accessibility</b> and inference. This paper introduces cell plus innocent security technique that utilizes the cell level security method but suppresses some innocent data to dodge an intruder that a suppressed cell may not necessarily contain secret data. Four variations of the technique namely cell plus innocent 1 / 4, cell plus innocent 2 / 4, cell plus innocent 3 / 4, and cell plus innocent 4 / 4 respectively have been introduced to suppress innocent data equal to 1 / 4, 2 / 4, 3 / 4, and 4 / 4 percent of the true secret data inside the database. Results show that the new technique offers better control over <b>data</b> <b>accessibility</b> and inference as compared to the state-of-theart security techniques.
