Later, Michael, Dwight, Ryan and Ryan's colleague, Troy Underbridge (Noel Petok) (who Dwight is certain is a Hobbit due to his short stature) wait outside another club, but fail to get in because they do not have dates. Dwight comes to the rescue when he manages to pair each of them with members of a women's basketball team, who are also waiting in line. Inside the club, Ryan's dancing becomes erratic and aggressive, and he accidentally hits a girl, prompting her friends to attack Ryan. Dwight and Michael escort him out of the club, and after Troy advises them not to take Ryan to a hospital, he runs off. Michael and Dwight bring Ryan back to his apartment, where he tells them that he thinks his [...] "friend Troy" [...] has a drug problem, and asks what he should do about it. Michael, oblivious to the fact that Ryan is obviously referring to his own drug addiction, gives him hypothetical advice involving a wiretap and snitching on a drug dealer. [...] He then tells the camera that he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> The Wire but does not understand {{what is going on in}} the show.|$|E

Many of them <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> the TV dramas and movies produced by Hong Kong, resulting in the city having significant cultural influence in the region. For instance, many Cantonese from mainland China write using Traditional Chinese characters, like Hongkongers do. Hong Kong, for its part, has experienced much cultural and economic exchanges with other East Asian nations. This in turn, made Hong Kong absorb the cultures of Korea, Japan and to some extent, Taiwan. For instance, Hong Kong Cantonese has many usages and vocabularies borrowed from Japanese.|$|E

2500|$|... "The Story of Us" [...] was {{met with}} mixed reviews from critics. While {{reviewing}} Speak Now, Dave Heaton of Pop Matters observed that the album is built upon conflicting stories which result in a discrepancy between those stories and the way life turns out. He added that [...] "'Story of Us' makes this explicit, by presenting the verses as 'chapters', within a song where the story isn’t being written the way [...] wants it to, turning into a 'tragedy' she didn’t imagine." [...] Liz Stinson of Paste was not impressed with the song and she likened Swift as the [...] "annoying cousin" [...] of Katy Perry for trying to embrace her pop side. Nevertheless, she felt that [...] "Swift is strongest when she lets her country roots shine through." [...] Theon Weber of The Village Voice chastised the song as [...] "giddy and bombastic (...) which plays around with glammy dance-pop." [...] Amanda Hensel of Taste of Country praised the song by claiming that it's [...] "upbeat and fun, and even a bit rock-y". Rahul Prabhakar of The Oxonian Review {{felt that it was}} [...] "fast-paced and destined for girls’ gym mixes, but otherwise boring."

Another couple, Davidson and Isabelle, arrive. By the way that Marie, her boyfriend, and later the character Ivitch address Davidson, it appears {{that he is a}} professor. Brandishing a copy of The Gulag Archipelago, Davidson remarks that its author, Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, did not need to use Google to search for the book's subtitle. The professor then asks Isabelle what thumbs used to be for before smartphones, making a punning reference to the French children's story Hop-o'-My-Thumb. He then proceeds to deliver an impromptu lecture on the ideas of Jacques Ellul, such as the abdication of individual rights and responsibilities to the state, a situation that Ellul declared to be the triumph of Adolf Hitler. Abruptly a car drives up, a man gets out and, speaking in German, he accosts Josette, who has been standing nearby. After demanding that she come home (implying that the man is Josette's husband), threatening her with consequences, and trying to physically drag her away, the man retreats out of frame and fires shots from a gun. As the other characters rush to where the shots were fired, the car departs. Josette wanders away, while Gédéon, who <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> all along, follows her. As Josette washes her hands in a fountain, Gédéon approaches and declares to her, [...] "I am at your service." ...|$|E
2500|$|... 1,000 {{years before}} [...] "the Age of Arthur" [...] (approximately 1,033 {{years before the}} Present Day), Merlin and a friend, Adda, were deserters from an army and were {{trekking}} through a desert, desperate for water. Merlin saw a light and ran after it, revealed to be the Holy Grail, {{on top of a}} stone. Thinking that it was sacred, Merlin initially refuses to touch it, but his friend, Abbas, disregards his warnings and decides to drink from it anyway. When his friend grabbed it, he turned to ashes. Merlin then grabbed the grail after praying to God for permission, and was able to drink from it. When he put his hand down, he realized he had magic. The desert was no more — only lush greenery and forests. 500 years later, Merlin is at a village healing people, where his apprentice informs him of a woman who escaped a burning village. Merlin meets the woman, who introduces herself as Nimue. She wants revenge on Vortigan, the masked man responsible. She also had Middlemist flowers to offer, as their survival will guarantee a form of revenge. Merlin agrees to help her and places the seeds in a planter, and he uses his magic to grow them instantly. Over {{the course of the next}} several months, they fall in love, and Merlin reveals the truth about the Grail and how he acquired magic. He expresses a wish to reforge the grail into a sword that can destroy his immortality, so that he can live a normal mortal life with Nimue as his wife. However, as they start their quest, it turns out that Vortigan <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>watching</b> them.|$|E
