It was at Whitfield Street Studios and there was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> MTV crew there filming them as they did this, which there was. Well, how on earth can you possibly do this? You can't write and record a song in half-an-hour with a film crew watching.|$|E
5|$|Before Crisis began {{development}} in 2002. The Compilation was first unveiled in 2003 with {{the announcement of}} Advent Children. None of the titles in the series {{up to that point}} were traditional role-playing games like the original. The explanation for this was that traditional RPGs took long production periods and a large staff, which would have made the project stand out a bit too much. One of the other considerations for the team was not to make the titles lightweight as X-2 had been, due to backlash from parts of the fanbase. Conversely, making Final Fantasy X-2 reminded the team that they did not need to stick to completely serious traditional RPGs, enabling the original creation of the Compilation. While Advent Children was the first Compilation title to begin production, it ran into problems during post-production, resulting in the first released title being Before Crisis, despite it being the second title to begin development. Before Crisis was also originally planned for release in North America, but the mobile phones available in North America at the time were not able to handle the game. In addition, the producer Kosei Ito left Square Enix in 2008 and Tabata moved on to other projects, leaving its localization unlikely. Japanese animation studio Madhouse created a commercial to promote Before Crisis. Due to its success and staff feelings that important scenes from VII represented in Advent Children had been needlessly disjointed, the studio was chosen to produce an animated film: this eventually became Last Order. Crisis Core was originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> action game, but became an action RPG, staying within the staff's design strengths while incorporating action elements.|$|E

It now lies at a depth of 40 metres. Its surviving crew became prisoners of war.|$|E

25|$|An issue {{likely to}} come into play will be a {{provision}} in the Amtrak Reform and Accountability Act of 1997 (P.L. 105-134), which places a US$200 million cap on the aggregate of all passengers' damage claims in a railroad accident against a passenger railroad, including punitive damages. Bloomberg News reported that this event would likely be the first legal test of this law, according to a former House rail committee staffer who helped write the law, who predicted that given the number of casualties, the cap is almost certainly <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> issue in pending litigation. An attorney representing two of the victims agreed, saying payouts could range from $5 million to $10 million per death or serious injury.

25|$|The Battle of Smolensk {{was another}} severe defeat for the Red Army {{in the opening}} phase of Operation Barbarossa. For the first time, the Soviets tried to {{implement}} a coordinated counter-attack against {{a large part of}} the front; although the counter-attack was almost entirely a failure, the increasing resistance showed that the Soviets were not yet defeated and that the Blitzkrieg towards Moscow was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> easy undertaking. Dissent within the German high command and political leadership was exacerbated. The leaders of the General Staff, Franz Halder and Brauchitsch and commanders like Bock, Hoth and Guderian counselled against dispersing the German armoured units and to concentrate on Moscow. Hitler reiterated the lack of importance of Moscow and of strategic encirclements and ordered a concentration on economic targets such as Ukraine, the Donets Basin and the Caucasus, with more tactical encirclements to weaken the Soviets further. The German offensive effort became more fragmented, leading to the Battle of Kiev and the Battle of Uman. The battles were German victories but costly in time, men and equipment on their approach towards Moscow, allowing the Soviets time to prepare the defenses of the city.|$|E
25|$|Cho {{found himself}} in the Judan once more, this time 14 years after his last bid as {{challenger}} in 1991 against Masaki Takemiya (Cho lost 3–2). Cho {{found himself in}} a league with old friends and rivals, including Masao Kato, Rin Kaiho, and Yoda Norimoto. The league also included young guns Cho U, Shinji Takao, and Keigo Yamashita. Keeping this in mind, it was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> easy campaign for Cho. His first match was against Yujiro Hashimoto. Cho, holding black, won the match by resignation. In his next match, he found himself against another young powerhouse, Kimio Yamada. This time, holding white, Cho squeezed by with a win of just half a point. Cho continued his run, his next opponent being Naoto Hikosaka. Again holding white, Cho went on to win by 2 and a half points. His last match of the main tournament was against Tomoyasu Mimura, of which he held white once more, and cruised past by resignation. His opponent for the challenger final was Shinji Takao, who had beaten at then some of the top players in Japan, Masao Kato and Norimoto Yoda, on his way into the loser's section of the tournament. Cho took white in the game, and won by 1 and a half points. This made Cho the challenger for the 43rd Judan against title holder O Rissei. O had held the title for 4 straight years before being challenged by Cho. The final would prove to be an exciting one, as the first match ended with a half point win for Cho. The next match was a win for O, by 5 and a half points. The third match was a very large win for O, winning by 19 and a half points, which is unusual to see in pro games. This didn't stop Cho, as he would get revenge by forcing O into resignation in the fourth game. The fifth and last game would go Cho's way, with a 5 and a half point win over O. This was Cho's 68th title, and fourth time winning the Judan.|$|E
