40|$|This paper {{examines}} how stringent de facto <b>firing</b> <b>regulations</b> affect firm size throughout the developing world. A large firm level dataset is used across 63 countries and within country {{variation in the}} enforcement of the labor codes in countries with very different de jure <b>firing</b> <b>regulations</b> is explored. The findings strongly suggest that firms facing a stricter enforcement of <b>firing</b> <b>regulations</b> are on average smaller. This finding is interpreted as supportive of the fact that more stringent de facto <b>firing</b> <b>regulations</b> tend to reduce average employment. Robust evidence is found that this effect is stronger for more labor intensive manufacturing firms, especially those operating in low-technology sectors. Evidence also shows that this negative correlation does not hold in countries with a very weak rule of law. Publisher's Versio...|$|R

25|$|Whitehaven Castle {{was built}} in 1769, {{replacing}} an earlier building destroyed by fire. In 1924, the Earl of Lonsdale sold Whitehaven Castle to Mr H. Walker, who then donated the building {{to the people of}} Cumbria, along with monies to convert it into a hospital to replace the Victorian Whitehaven Hospital. With the opening of the new West Cumberland Hospital in 1964, the castle became a geriatric unit until forced to close in 1986, owing to <b>fire</b> <b>regulations.</b> It has now been converted to private housing.|$|E

However, the original wooden panelling does not conform to modern <b>fire</b> <b>regulations,</b> so as in Queen Mary 2, veneers would have had to be used. Plans showed a layout broadly similar to the original, but with the third-class cabins modernised, and consideration being given to en-suite cabins throughout the ship. The room freed up by eliminating the steam boilers of the original ship would have been used for crew quarters and various services.|$|E
40|$|This article {{examines}} five types of labour market institutions: statutory minimum wages, working-time <b>regulations,</b> hiring and <b>firing</b> <b>regulations,</b> trade unions and industrial relations. It uses {{the results of}} surveys that were carried our between 1996 and 2001 among senior business executives from 12 transition countries. In these surveys the managers characterised the institutions of their respective countries. The article conducts multivariate regressions incorporating the survey results and finds that high statutory minimum wages, strict working-time regulations, tight hiring and <b>firing</b> <b>regulations,</b> powerful unions as well as confrontational industrial relations lead to higher unemployment and lower employment, mainly among the problem groups of the labour market: the low-skilled, the long-term unemployed, young people and women. ...|$|R

25|$|Height {{limits in}} the Melbourne CBD were lifted in 1958, after the {{construction}} of ICI House, transforming the city's skyline {{with the introduction of}} skyscrapers. Suburban expansion then intensified, served by new indoor malls beginning with Chadstone Shopping Centre. The post-war period also saw a major renewal of the CBD and St Kilda Road which significantly modernised the city. New <b>fire</b> <b>regulations</b> and redevelopment saw most of the taller pre-war CBD buildings either demolished or partially retained through a policy of facadism. Many of the larger suburban mansions from the boom era were also either demolished or subdivided.|$|E

Andes was almost 30 years old and {{nearing the end of}} her career, but RML decided to have her upgraded to the new standards. In May 1967 she returned to Belfast, where Harland and Wolff undertook the first phase of her final refit. She resumed cruising for the summer and autumn, but her 1967–68 Christmas cruise was cancelled to allow her builders to complete the work. The refit added new fire-resistant bulkheads, doors and ceilings. At the same time the opportunity was taken to replace her boiler tubes.|$|E
25|$|Due to its {{enclosed}} sub-surface platforms, New Street {{was designated}} as an underground station {{by the fire}} service. In the 1990s a number of changes {{had to be made}} to the station in order to comply with stricter <b>fire</b> <b>regulations,</b> introduced for underground stations {{as a result of the}} 1987 King's Cross fire. In 1993, a new enclosed footbridge was opened at the Wolverhampton end of the station, with access to the platforms separate from the main building: this was built primarily as a fire exit, but the new exit from the station into Navigation Street was opened to the public. All wooden fittings were removed from the platforms, and new fire doors were also installed at the foot of the stairs and elevators on the platforms.|$|E

25|$|Other {{criticisms of}} UK <b>fire</b> <b>regulations</b> voiced in the {{aftermath}} of the fire include the lack of external sprinklers, mandated in Dubai and Australia for example for buildings featuring combustible cladding, the lack of internal sprinklers, which could have contained the original fire, and a 1986 change in the law under the then Conservative government that abolished a requirement that external walls should have at least one hour's fire resistance to prevent blazes from re-entering a building and spreading to other apartments. Wales has required sprinklers to be installed in new houses and flats built since 2016. A BBC Breakfast investigation, focusing on half of the UK's council owned and housing association owned tower blocks, found that 2% of them have full sprinkler systems. Deaths were 87% lower when buildings with sprinklers caught fire. England, Wales and Scotland all require sprinklers in newly built tall buildings but this does not apply retrospectively to older buildings. The same investigation found that one tower block in three has more than one staircase where people can be evacuated. The London fire chief has called for sprinklers to be retrofitted in all social housing blocks.|$|E

50|$|External {{numerical}} {{flexibility is}} the adjustment of the labour intake, {{or the number}} of workers from the external market. This can be achieved by employing workers on temporary work or fixed-term contracts or through relaxed hiring and <b>firing</b> <b>regulations</b> or in other words relaxation of employment protection legislation, where employers can hire and fire permanent employees according to the firms’ needs.|$|R
30|$|Recall {{that when}} {{interactions}} between Mean Obstacle Labor and our preferred measure of enforcement Obstacle Informal Low are allowed for as in columns (3) of Table  4 and (2) of Table  5, the interaction terms become positive and significant, but primarily only when rigidity of <b>regulations</b> on <b>firing</b> is concerned as in columns (2), (4) and (6) of Table  5. This complicates {{the determination of}} the net effects of changes in these measures on Training. From the relevant parameter estimates of Table  5, however, it can be seen that, when enforcement of the <b>firing</b> <b>regulations</b> is quite high and the <b>firing</b> <b>regulations</b> scored as being fairly high (i.e., at least moderately rigid), the positive impact of these interaction terms will more than counterbalance the direct negative effect of Mean Obstacle Labor. 8 Hence, {{from the point of view}} of firm-supplied training at least, it should be clear that priority in enforcement of labor regulations should be given to the <b>regulations</b> on <b>firing.</b>|$|R

On top of this they had to work within the more strict <b>fire</b> <b>regulations</b> laid down after the end of World War II, which gave them a limited palette consisting of few woods and much aluminium, Formica, and plastic veneers. This was very much like the interiors of the , put into service nearly ten years previous, and inspired the design of the public rooms on the [...] eight years later. [...] Also, <b>fire</b> <b>regulations</b> would not allow the France to have the grand vistas that were constructed through the Normandie's main First Class rooms.

2500|$|With the {{pressing}} {{need to increase}} its capacity over the years, [...] buildings were added, and existing ones, renovated. The number of accommodation blocks for inmates gradually increased to ten, with a capacity of 1,500 inmates. The number of training workshops had also increased to five. Added too, were additional facilities and amenities, which included a family visiting area, a counselling clinic, a welfare officer's room, and a praying room (surau). The 4.5 acre (18,000 m²) compound, enclosed by a 20 feet (6 m) high wall, remained {{as it was in}} 1883. The area surrounding the prison had been fully developed, with staff quarters, occupying 9.4 acres (38,000 m²). Thus, every available space within the compound had to be fully utilized. Buildings were packed so close to each other, that one wonders whether <b>fire</b> <b>regulations</b> had been infringed. Even so, inmates had to be crammed up to seven or eight to a cell, when these were originally designed for three.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{recorded}} commission for the firm, around 1875–76, {{was a complete}} rebuild of Blenheim House (56 Old Steine) in the centre of Brighton. [...] This {{was one of several}} old buildings (along with Marlborough House and Steine House) {{on the west side of}} Brighton's first fashionable area, the low-lying grassland of Old Steine. [...] In 1876–77, they extended the Brighton Friends Meeting House, built for Quakers in 1805, and in 1894 they extended and comprehensively redesigned the town's famous Theatre Royal, partly in response to new <b>fire</b> <b>regulations.</b> [...] Much of the firm's early work, though, consisted of housebuilding and surveying in the rapidly developing residential town of Hove, a comfortable middle-class counterpoint to the neighbouring resort of Brighton, in which [...] "a certain gentility prevails" [...] in the spacious streets of finely detailed houses. [...] The landmark Gwydyr Mansions at the bottom of Holland Road, a Flemish Renaissance red-brick and ashlar block of mansion flats with integral facilities such as a restaurant and barber shop, date from 1890. [...] Their next work was in Lansdowne Road (1891), Furze Hill (1893), Holland Road (1895: a studio) and Portland Road (1895: several pairs of semi-detached houses and villas). [...] On Holland Road, a major north–south route, they were also responsible for shops, flats and a religious institute in 1898, a factory for Green & Company in 1911, and a set of garages in 1925. [...] From 1895, they were the main surveyors to the Vallance Estate, a development of high-class Domestic Revival/Queen Anne-style red-brick housing on land owned by the Vallance family. [...] In particular, they were engaged at Pembroke Crescent and Pembroke Avenue, part of the Pembroke & Princes conservation area, almost continuously between 1895 and 1906, and at Vallance Road and Vallance Gardens until 1907. [...] At the same time, but back in Brighton, they built a seaside convalescent home for French nationals who were patients at the French Hospital in London. [...] The distinctive turreted structure is now Grade II-listed. [...] Also contemporary were a veterinary surgery on Goldsmid Road and the small terraced streets between Old Shoreham Road, Sackville Road and the railway line—Frith, Poynter, Landseer, Prinsep and Leighton Roads. [...] Between 1892 and 1900 they also built up Sackville Road, another important north–south route, with shops, houses and the vicarage of St Barnabas' Church. [...] In 1894–97, they were responsible for a large complex of school buildings in the Aldrington area of Hove, and in 1900 they designed and built a new hall at the Ellen Street schools in Hove (demolished in 1974)—an elaborate Queen Anne-style building designed in 1877 by Thomas Simpson, under whom Clayton was studying at that time.|$|E
