25|$|A pair of mules {{would be}} manned {{by a person}} called the minder and two boys called the side piecer and the little piecer. They worked barefoot in humid temperatures, the minder and the little piecer worked the minder half of the mule. The minder would make minor {{adjustments}} to his mules {{to the extent that}} each mule worked differently. They were specialists in spinning, and were only answerable to the gaffer and under-gaffer who were in charge of the floor and with it {{the quantity and quality of}} the yarn that was produced. Bobbins of rovings came from the carder in the blowing room delivered by a bobbin carrier who was part of the carder's staff, and yarn was hoisted down to the warehouse by the warehouseman's staff. Delineation of jobs was rigid and communication would be through the means of coloured slips of paper written on in <b>indelible</b> <b>pencil.</b>|$|E
60|$|Rising stiffly, he {{laid the}} flour-bag, which he had not shaken {{absolutely}} empty, by Grenfell's side; and, taking from his pocket an <b>indelible</b> <b>pencil</b> that he happened to have with him, he moistened {{the point of it}} and scrawled a message across a piece of the almost-empty package in which they had carried their tea.|$|E
60|$|Milt {{stripped}} off his overalls and derby-crown, and washed his big, firm hands with gritty soft soap. He cleaned his nails with a file which he carried in his upper vest pocket {{in a red}} imitation morocco case which contained a comb, a mirror, an <b>indelible</b> <b>pencil,</b> and a note-book with the smudged pencil addresses of five girls in St. Cloud, and a memorandum about Rauskukle's car.|$|E
60|$|On {{the left}} {{a group of}} young men with keen young faces, all turned toward Luke and toward Louisa and her father. Note-books {{protruded}} out of great-coat pockets, fountain pens and <b>indelible</b> <b>pencils</b> snuggled close to hand. Lucky the lightning artist who could sketch for the benefit of his journalistic patrons a rough outline of the gentleman with more than one foot in the dock. Close by, a couple of boys in blue uniform, with wallet at the side and smart pill-box cap on the head, stood ready to take messages, fractions of news, hurried reports to less-favoured mortals whose duty or desire kept them away from this scene of poignant interest.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Indelible</b> <b>pencils</b> {{were the}} cause of {{significant}} health risks due {{to the presence of}} aniline dyes. Exposure to aniline dyes could lead to eczema, acne and carcinoma. Penetration of the pencil lead into the body commonly leads to severe and debilitating effects such as fever, anaemia, elevated white cell count, gastro-intestinal upset, kidney and liver damage, anorexia and necrosis of the tissue surrounding the wound. Such risks are not associated with ordinary graphite pencils. While these symptoms may appear after a couple of days they often develop only after weeks have passed since the injury was sustained. Surgery is required to remove the lead and the infected tissue and [...] "the necrotizing action may be so severe and extensive amputation is necessary".|$|R
6000|$|He {{accepted}} the compliment calmly, as men must in lands where women make the love, tore a leaf from a note-book, {{and with a}} patent <b>indelible</b> <b>pencil</b> wrote in gross Shikast--the script that bad little boys use when they write dirt on walls: 'I have everything that they have written: their pictures of the country, and many letters. Especially the murasla. Tell me what to do. I am at Shamlegh-under-the-Snow. The old man is sick.' ...|$|E
60|$|Farther on sat the Countess of Flintshire, {{novelist and}} playwright, eager and serious, note-book {{in hand and}} a frown between her brows, {{denoting}} thought and concentration of purpose. She bowed gravely to Louisa, and contrived to attract Luke's attention, so that he turned toward her, {{and she was able}} to note carefully in <b>indelible</b> <b>pencil</b> in a tiny note-book that a murderer about to meet his just fate may bestow an infinity of care on the niceties of his own toilet.|$|E
60|$|The manager moved a {{wire basket}} of carbon copies {{of letters from}} {{the left side of his}} desk to the right, staring at them thoughtfully; rearranged his pencils in a pile before his ink-well; glanced at the point of an <b>indelible</b> <b>pencil</b> with a manner of startled examination; tapped his desk-blotter with his knuckles; then raised his eyes. He studied Mr. Wrenn, smiled, put on the look he used when {{inviting}} him out for a drink. Mr. Guilfogle was essentially an honest fellow, harshened by The Job; a well-satisfied victim, with the imagination clean gone out of him, so that he took follow-up letters and the celerity of office-boys as the only serious things in the world. He was strong, alive, not at all a bad chap, merely efficient.|$|E
6000|$|Martin Dockerill ate pun'kin {{pie with}} his fingers, played [...] "Marching through Georgia" [...] on the mouth-organ, admired burlesque-show women in sausage-shaped pink tights, and wore balbriggan socks that always reposed in {{wrinkles}} {{over the tops}} of his black shoes with frayed laces. But he probably could build a very decent motor in the dark, out of four tin cans and a crowbar. In A.D. 1910 he still believed in hell and plush albums. But he dreamed of wireless power-transmission. He was a Free and Independent American Citizen who called the Count de Lesseps, [...] "Hey, Lessup." [...] But he would have gone with Carl aeroplaning to the South Pole upon five minutes' notice--four minutes to devote to the motor, and one minute to write, with purple <b>indelible</b> <b>pencil,</b> a post-card to his aunt in Fall River. He was precise about only two things--motor-timing and calling himself a [...] "mechanician," [...] not a [...] "mechanic." [...] He became very friendly with Hank Odell; helped him repair his broken machine, went with him to vaudeville, or stood with him before the hangar, watching the automobile parties of pretty girls with lordly chaperons that came to call on Grahame-White and Drexel. [...] "Some heart-winners, them guys, but I back my boss against them and ev'body else, Hank," [...] Martin would say.|$|E

50|$|A copying pencil, also <b>indelible</b> <b>pencil,</b> is pencil whose lead {{contains}} a dye. The lead is fabricated {{by adding a}} dry water-soluble permanent dye to powdered graphite - used in standard graphite pencils - before binding the mixture with clay.|$|E
5000|$|Flag {{presented}} to the Officers and Men of HMS Undaunted by General Eisenhower. During the afternoon of 7 June 1944, HMS Undaunted embarked General Eisenhower, Admiral Ramsay and their staffs, whose ship had grounded. This flag was hoisted at the starboard yard arm. General Eisenhower signed his name across two of the stars, using an <b>indelible</b> <b>pencil</b> dipped in whiskey.|$|E
50|$|By {{the end of}} the 19th century, better copying methods {{had become}} available. Consequently, the copying pencil was being used as an <b>indelible</b> <b>pencil,</b> a {{precursor}} to the ball-point pen. When used dry, it left a slightly-purplish gray mark on paper, not dissimilar to a lead pencil's, but which could not be erased. When used wet, its tip moistened repeatedly by water or saliva, it produced a bright purple writing. The copying pencil served as a convenient substitute for the fountain-pen: it could be carried on one's person without need for ink or fear of leaks. Furthermore, for producing copies using carbon paper, copying pencils were considered superior to both ordinary pencils (whose writing in the original could be erased) and fountain-pens (whose nibs could not always withstand the pressure needed to produce the carbon-copy).|$|E
5000|$|Holmes {{explains}} how {{he reached his}} conclusion. Amberley’s alibi fell apart when Holmes discovered that his seat at the Haymarket Theatre had not been occupied on the night in question, its number deduced from the ticket that Watson had seen. Also, the painting was a clue. Holmes realised that it was being done to mask a smell, and he soon discovered what that was: gas. He found a gas pipe leading into the strongroom with a tap outside. Amberley had lured his wife and her lover [...] - [...] for so he had believed Dr. Ernest to be [...] - [...] into the strongroom, locked them in, and turned the gas on, killing them out of jealousy. He had simply hidden the [...] "stolen" [...] valuables somewhere. In <b>indelible</b> <b>pencil,</b> {{one of the victims}} wrote [...] "We we…", perhaps meaning to write [...] "We were murdered." ...|$|E
