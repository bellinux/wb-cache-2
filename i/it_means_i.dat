25|$|In a 2005 {{interview}} with Pearce, he recalls the event:This {{has to do}} with politics, not to do with me because they had a local election and they thought I was going to bring an army of skinheads to Lausanne and destroy the city. Because they've heard from someone in Germany who contacted a policeman in Bern. And the policeman in Bern contacted the authorities in Lausanne. This is like gossip. This is like fishwives. This is like old women. I don't care about old women gossiping. If {{at the end of the}} day, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>I</b> don't play, good, I don't want to play in the city of old women talking about people behind their backs. And they are so stupid they believe in all the rumours.|$|E
500|$|After Chesnutt read several {{compliments}} {{from friends}} and in various newspaper reviews, he wrote to editor Walter Hines Page, [...] "taking it all in all, I have had a slight glimpse of what <b>it</b> <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> imagine, {{to be a successful}} author." ...|$|E
2500|$|Though lacking formal {{education}} themselves, Coretta Scott's parents intended {{for all of}} their children to be educated. Coretta quoted her mother as having said, [...] "My {{children are going to}} college, even if <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>I</b> only have but one dress to put on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Eh?" [...] said Mr. Piper, in amaze, {{as he read}} slowly: [...] "’No—need—send—money—Uncle—Joseph—has—come—back.—Berry,’ What does <b>it</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>Is</b> she mad?" ...|$|R
6000|$|Mrs. Campbell: [...] "Oh, Willis, don't torment me! What do {{you suppose}} <b>it</b> <b>means?</b> <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> some--mistake? It's for {{somebody}} else!" ...|$|R
6000|$|Bathsheba {{could not}} face the haymakers now. Her heart erratically flitting hither and thither from perplexed excitement, hot, and almost tearful, she retreated homeward, murmuring, [...] "Oh, what have I done! What does <b>it</b> <b>mean!</b> <b>I</b> wish I {{knew how much}} of it was true!" ...|$|R
2500|$|In 1987, {{two years}} before the December Revolution toppled communism, Rusz decided to leave Romania for West Germany. This gesture was a {{consequence}} of nationalist and national communist policies adopted by the regime of Nicolae Ceauşescu and specifically targeting some of Romania's ethnic minorities. According to writer György Györfi-Deák, Ceauşescu [...] "gave a hard time to the Hungarians", and Rusz personally was [...] "harassed by the dictator's politruks and Securitate men". After a short stay in Germany, Rusz settled in Budapest, Hungary, where she owns a villa. She continued her activity, becoming a noted contributor to the Hungarian comic school (with albums such as Miskati közbelép, [...] "Miskati Intervenes"). The change was described by the artist herself as a difficult one: [...] "Even plants will suffer when moved from one pot to another; it was not easy for me either to build up my new roots, but as long as forces permit me and I can still work <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>I</b> am alive." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> take it, {{first and}} {{foremost}} for us, that the world cannot wait for the English.|$|E
6000|$|... "And do {{you find}} it more poetic when you don't quite know what <b>it</b> <b>means?</b> <b>I</b> thought it was only in {{revealed}} religion that a mistranslation improved the sense." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'What is this!' said Gashford, {{turning it}} over {{with an air of}} {{perfectly}} natural surprise. 'Where did you get it from, my good fellow; what does <b>it</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>I</b> don't understand this at all.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I {{never heard}} {{anything}} to equal this! Good heavens, what does <b>it</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>I</b> know <b>it</b> is awfully rude to inquire a lady's age, but what am I to do? Will you kindly tell me Edra's age?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. How about <b>it?</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> don't {{know much}} about this sort of thing, {{but do you think}} it's the sort of thing Jill ought to be doing?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This," [...] said [...] .007, as he flew, [...] "is a hot-box. Now I {{know what}} <b>it</b> <b>means.</b> <b>I</b> shall go to pieces, I guess. My first road-run, too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If I am {{too late}} this time," [...] he declared, [...] "then {{an act of}} treason has been committed. You know what <b>it</b> <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> suppose, to {{communicate}} with the enemy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Paul," [...] he cried, and {{stepping}} {{forward into the}} room, [...] "and Adrea! You here, and together! Tell me what <b>it</b> <b>means!</b> <b>I</b> {{have a right to}} know. I will know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is true," [...] Selingman assented. [...] "He {{crossed to}} Paris, and--mark the cunning of it--he {{returned}} to England. That same night he travelled to Germany. We lost him in Vienna {{and found him}} again in Sofia. What does <b>it</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> wonder? What does it mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{believe the}} play {{will be a}} success. I have had a curious sense with me all day that {{something}} pleasant is going to happen. I feel as though fortune had taken me by the hand. What does <b>it</b> <b>mean,</b> <b>I</b> wonder?" ...|$|R
6000|$|QUEEN: MY beloved lord, [...] 455 Have you not {{noted that}} the Fool of late Has lost his {{careless}} mirth, and that his words Sound like the echoes of our saddest fears? What can <b>it</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>I</b> should be loth to think Some factious slave had tutored him.|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} <b>it</b> <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> tell you. It's {{a word that}} people uses for--for--well, it's ornamental. They don't put ruffles on a shirt to keep a person warm, do they?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Doge. <b>It</b> <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> am more citizen than either. [...] If {{we had not}} {{for many}} centuries [...] Had {{thousands}} of such citizens, and shall, [...] I trust, have still such, Venice were no city.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are kind}} and your trust means much," [...] she said. [...] "For one thing, <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>I</b> must make good. Jim's {{inheritance}} must be managed well. We {{will try to}} rule at Langrigg as his people ruled." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, {{but would}} it be an idle errand?" [...] she said slowly. [...] "Victor, be frank with me. I should hate to refuse {{anything}} you asked me. Tell me what <b>it</b> <b>means.</b> <b>Is</b> my husband's work of any real value, and if so to whom, and for what purpose?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} are! How could I write {{in any other}} way except through the darkened spectacles? However, there's a way out--of {{altering}} <b>it,</b> <b>I</b> <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> feel flashes of it already. Listen." ...|$|R
50|$|If {{you read}} his name {{backwards}} in korean, <b>it</b> litterally <b>means</b> (<b>I</b> AM PRINCE) (Nan-"I am") (Wangja-"prince").|$|R
6000|$|... "She's dah ag'in, Mars Tom, she's dah ag'in, en I knows I's gwine to die, 'case when a body sees a ghos' de third time, dat's what <b>it</b> <b>means.</b> <b>I</b> wisht I'd {{never come}} in dis balloon, dat I does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is. What <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>I</b> do not know, but it {{was given}} to me because of some dream that my mother had the night before I was born. Do you tell me what it means, since you seem to know so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you do not}} mind," [...] {{the banker}} answered, [...] "I should be glad if you would take it with you. <b>It</b> <b>means,</b> <b>I</b> think, a matter of six or seven {{thousand}} pounds added to your overdraft, but as a temporary thing we will pass that." ...|$|E
60|$|JOHN.--Owe for <b>it,</b> you <b>mean.</b> <b>I</b> don't {{think your}} tradesmen profit much by your custom, ex-Cornet Kicklebury.|$|R
6000|$|... "I fear, Sir Henry, that <b>it</b> must <b>mean</b> <b>it.</b> <b>I</b> {{have not}} been on terms with my {{grandfather}} which would admit of my doing so." ...|$|R
60|$|Jack. My {{brother is}} in the dining-room? I don't know what <b>it</b> all <b>means.</b> <b>I</b> think <b>it</b> is {{perfectly}} absurd.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah," [...] said Skene, cunningly; [...] "but she can't {{write it}} though. That's {{the worst of}} writing; no one can't never tell exactly what <b>it</b> <b>means.</b> <b>I</b> never signed {{articles}} yet that there weren't some misunderstanding about; and articles is the best writing that can be had anywhere." ...|$|E
60|$|I {{am in the}} Law, but not of it. I can't exactly {{make out}} what <b>it</b> <b>means.</b> <b>I</b> sit in Westminster Hall {{sometimes}} (in character) from ten to four; and when I go out of Court, I don't know whether I am standing on my wig or my boots.|$|E
6000|$|... "Whatever <b>it</b> <b>means</b> <b>I</b> don't in {{the least}} mind BEING mixed. Therefore if you don't and I don't," [...] Maisie concluded, [...] "don't you think that when I see him this evening I had better just tell him we don't and ask him {{why in the world}} HE should?" ...|$|E
60|$|Then {{find some}} beggar {{and ask him}} what <b>it</b> <b>means,</b> for <b>I</b> will {{have nothing to do}} with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "What does <b>it</b> <b>mean?</b> Oh, {{what does}} <b>it</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>I</b> am my father's daughter--a Mormon, yet I can't see! I've not failed in religion--in duty. For years I've given {{with a free}} and full heart. When my father died I was rich. If I'm still rich it's because I couldn't find enough ways to become poor. What am I, what are my {{possessions}} {{to set in motion}} such intensity of secret oppression?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All {{this you}} {{have said to me}} before. What does <b>it</b> <b>mean?</b> <b>I</b> fought this battle at the {{instigation}} of the family, from no feeling of my own. You are the head of the family and you were consulted on the step. Unless I had concluded that it was with your sanction, I certainly should not have made my appearance on the hustings." ...|$|R
