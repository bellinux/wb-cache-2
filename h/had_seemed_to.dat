5|$|In 23BC Emperor Augustus became gravely ill and his {{possible}} death {{threatened to}} plunge the Roman world into chaos again. Historians generally {{agree that it}} is during this time that the question of Augustus' heir became most acute, and while Augustus <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> indicate that Agrippa and Marcellus would carry on his position in the event of his death, the ambiguity of succession became Augustus' chief problem.|$|E
5|$|Back in England, Trescothick {{was called}} upon to captain England after Michael Vaughan {{sustained}} a knee injury. Although other England captains <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> suffer a lack of batting form, the extra authority did not affect Trescothick, and he forged a good partnership with debutant Andrew Strauss against New Zealand. This understanding developed in the second Test with a first-wicket partnership of 153; Trescothick went on to score 132, his sixth Test century. Trescothick's partnerships with Strauss were to average 52.35 in 52 innings. His first century against the West Indies followed in the second Test, and Trescothick became {{the first player to}} make centuries in both innings of a Test match at Edgbaston, and the ninth England player to score a century in each innings of a Test match. Trescothick was again England's best One Day International batsman in the 2004 ICC Champions Trophy, scoring 261 runs in just four innings, including a century in the final; he also took his fourth ODI wicket.|$|E

25|$|In 1964, Labour {{regained the}} premiership, as Harold Wilson {{narrowly}} won {{the general election}} with a majority of five. This was not sufficient to last for a full term and, after {{a short period of}} competent government, in March 1966, he won re-election with a landslide majority of 99. As Prime Minister, his opponents accused him of deviousness, especially over the matter of devaluation of the pound in November 1967. Wilson had rejected devaluation for many years, yet in his broadcast <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> present it as a triumph.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} his batting <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be in decline, {{and he had}} not made a fifty since 1961. But in 1965, in his 32 games he came within four runs of {{reaching}} his thousand for the season. His average was {{more than twice that}} in any previous season, and he made five fifties, one of them the highest score of his career of 98. His final tally was 996 runs at 34.34. He also had a fine season with the ball, with 86 wickets at 20.47, on nine occasions taking five or more wickets in an innings, with best figures of 6/11.|$|E

25|$|In 638, the Byzantine emperor Heraclius, {{with the}} support of or at the {{instigation}} of Patriarch Sergius I of Constantinople, published the Ecthesis, which defined as the official imperial form of Christianity Monothelitism, the doctrine that, while Christ possessed two natures, he had only a single will. This was widely accepted in the East, but before the Ecthesis reached Rome, Pope Honorius I, who <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> support Monothelitism, died, and his successor Pope Severinus condemned the Ecthesis outright, and so was forbidden his seat until 640. His successor Pope John IV also rejected the doctrine completely, leading to a major schism between the eastern and western halves of the Chalcedonian Church, which was healed when the doctrine of the Ecthesis was condemned.|$|E
25|$|This {{incident}} {{illustrates that}} in the Republic the relationship between Church and State always remained problematic, even though it <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be settled {{in favor of the}} church in 1619. Though the regents knew better than to interfere in matters of doctrine (as they were accused of doing in 1618), they thought they had certain rights of oversight in return for the privileged status of the Reformed Church. The clergy, on the other hand, had never reconciled itself to such oversight, and on the contrary was of the opinion that the Church had a right to oversee public policy. As the regents would never concede such a right there was a constant tension between the two, not least in the matter of tolerance, or rather, Toleration.|$|E
25|$|Many British {{scholars}} {{were slow}} to accept the truth. Some of the routes mentioned by the work <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have been subsequently borne out and excuses were made for the known errors. Further evidence of the falsity of The Description of Britain {{came out in the}} following years, however, until no serious effort could be made in defense of the document. Bertram had on several occasions adopted variant readings and hypotheses unknown before Camden. The final confirmation that the Description was spurious came in the 1860s. Over four articles in 1866 and 1867, B.B.Woodward thoroughly debunked the work and, in 1869, J.E.B. Mayor complimented this by thoroughly comparing the Description with the Historial Mirror written by the real Richard of Cirencester (his only surviving work), which he had been reviewing and editing for the Rolls Series. Blame fell hardest on the reputation of William Stukeley, although it also impugned Gibbon, Roy, and other scholars who had accepted it.|$|E

25|$|By 1917, Hardrick's local {{reputation}} {{was such that}} he and William Edouard Scott were featured in the Tenth Annual Exhibition of Works by Indiana Artists at the Herron School of Art, both men receiving critical praise. By 1924, he and Hale Woodruff shared a studio at 542½ Indiana Avenue. Unfortunately, his financial situation was such that by 1925 he {{was working in the}} family trucking business and had started a carpet cleaning business to help support his family, but still found time to paint. Commenting on a 1927 exhibition at the Pettis Gallery in Indianapolis, one review commented that his work <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> grow and mature in those two years. That same year he and Woodruff were among those featured at the Art Institute of Chicago's exhibition of African-American artists. In addition, that year he received a $100 honorarium and second-place bronze medal from the Harmon Foundation. It was presented to him by mayor Ert Slack during a ceremony which honored the achievements of local African-Americans as part of the city's sixth annual Inter-Racial Sunday. This led to a fund drive to purchase one of his best-known paintings, Little Brown Girl.|$|E
25|$|Captaincy had a {{positive}} effect on Inzamam's batting, often leading by example in pressure situations, averaging greater as a captain (52) than without (50). In ODI's Inzamam also held the highest average as captain in ODI's and is currently third on that list behind the former Australian skipper Ricky Ponting and the Indian captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni. After early failures in Australia, he took a depleted Pakistan side to India in 2005 and {{played an important role in}} securing a draw by winning the final test match from an unlikely position with an innings of 184 runs. He subsequently led his side to an ODI success against West Indies (away), England (home) and Sri Lanka (away) as well as Test Series victories against England (home), India (home), Sri Lanka (away). Inzamam <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have united the Pakistan side and victories led them to 2nd place in the ICC Test Rankings and 3rd place in the ICC ODI Ranking. The latter part of Inzamam's tenure as Pakistan captain was less successful and the team was embroiled in many controversies culminating in a disappointingly early exit from the 2007 Cricket World Cup at the hands of lowly ranked Ireland.|$|E
25|$|By {{the end of}} July a large Viet Cong {{force had}} been {{detected}} by SAS patrols east of Nui Dat, near the abandoned village of Long Tan. In response, 6 RAR launched a battalion search and destroy operation. During a series of fire-fights on 25 July a company from D445 Battalion bounced off C Company, {{and in the process}} of retreating assaulted B Company occupying a blocking position, before being driven off with heavy casualties. In the following days further clashes occurred around Long Tan, resulting in 13 Viet Cong killed and 19 wounded, and Australian losses of three killed and 19 wounded. Yet with the inhabitants resettled, the village fortified and the perimeter regularly patrolled, the Australians considered the area secure. However, with the 274th and 275th Regiments still at large, uncertainty resulted in growing tension in 1 ATF. Believing Viet Cong sympathisers had returned to Long Tan, they planned to search the area again on 29 July. That afternoon, as 6 RAR commenced a detailed search following its initial sweep, Jackson ordered its immediate return to Nui Dat in response to South Vietnamese reports of a large Viet Cong presence close to the base, with the battalion airlifted out by early evening. Although the warnings were unconfirmed and an attack against Nui Dat was considered unlikely, 1 ATF was re-postured. Company patrols were sent out in each direction over the following days, but found little of significance. Jackson <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> over-react, and his requests for assistance from US II FFV were denied. Later intelligence discredited the original reporting and the crisis subsided, yet it was indicative of the alarms 1 ATF experienced during the first months of its lodgement and their effect.|$|E

As described by Dave Marsh, it is [...] "a masterpiece in which Presley immediately catches up with pop music trends that <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> pass him by during the movie years.

500|$|The {{top three}} {{finishers}} were escorted to the grandstand to collect their trophies.

[...] The prestige Renault gained from Szisz's victory led to an increase in sales for the company, from around 1,600cars in 1906 to more than 3,000 a year later, and increasing to more than 4,600 in 1908. But the race had not proven the superiority of the French motorcar; an Italian car had finished second and only seven of the twenty-three French cars that had started the race finished it.|$|E

Additionally, Henson wanted the Muppet characters to [...] "speak" [...] more creatively than was possible for previous puppets—which <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> have random mouth movements—so he used precise mouth movements to match the dialogue.|$|E

[...] Previously, a season two episode <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> confirm that Jin was infertile, leading to ramped up speculation online that Sun was pregnant by her lover Jae Lee.

[...] During this six-week period, she claimed, she and Brownlee had had sex every night; Brownlee would signal her to leave her room by turning on the tap in the second floor bathroom, and then flush the toilet and walk in lockstep with her to mask the sound of her movement. [...] Once in the premier's room, they would have sex next to his sleeping son, taking care to be quiet.

500|$|The Cleveland premiere on {{the evening}} of April 20, 1953 saw a {{distinguished}} crowd turn out. When the stage backdrop failed to come down on time, Hammerstein was heard to mutter, [...] "Damn and damn and damn! This is a new way: they saved it for the performance!" [...] Nevertheless, the crowd gave the show a rousing welcome. The Cleveland critics thought well of the show, but were concerned about the weak story. After the Cleveland reactions and problems, according to Rodgers biographer Meryle Secrest, [...] "what <b>had</b> <b>seemed</b> <b>to</b> be a show needing minor adjustments became a musical in serious trouble". Bigley remembered that she had just come from a hit and [...] "there just wasn't the same energy". Hammerstein had intended to omit the overture, with the audience to watch, after the curtain rose, a blank stage on which the play-within-the-play performers and crew drifted in and began their preparations. Expecting the orchestra to begin the evening, the audience talked throughout the initial scenes before being quieted by the internal show's overture; in response, the duo abandoned Hammerstein's concept and opened with an overture.|$|E
