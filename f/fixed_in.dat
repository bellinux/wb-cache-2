5|$|Assuming {{genetic drift}} {{is the only}} {{evolutionary}} force acting on an allele, {{at any given time}} the probability that an allele will eventually become <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> the population is simply its frequency in the population at that time. For example, if the frequency p for allele A is 75% and the frequency q for allele B is 25%, then given unlimited time the probability A will ultimately become <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> the population is 75% and the probability that B will become fixed is 25%.|$|E

5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is entanglement in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking entanglement in any rope or net <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale entanglement in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E

5|$|As the {{tradition}} of classical Gaelic poetry declined, a new tradition of vernacular Gaelic poetry began to emerge. While Classical poetry used a language largely <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> the twelfth century, the vernacular continued to develop. In contrast to the Classical tradition, which used syllabic metre, vernacular poets tended to use stressed metre. However, they shared with the Classic poets a set of complex metaphors and role, as the verse was still often panegyric. A number of these vernacular poets were women, such as Mary MacLeod of Harris (c. 1615–1707).|$|E
5|$|Burnell {{was behind}} {{the efforts of the}} royal {{officials}} to enforce royal rights during his term of office as chancellor, including the implementation of the Quo warranto procedures. He also helped with the legislative and legal reforms of Edward's reign. During Burnell's tenure the chancellor's office and records became <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> London rather than travelling with the king. Burnell went abroad on diplomatic missions for Edward, and for a time governed Gascony. He continued to enjoy the king's trust until his death in 1292; one historian has suggested that Burnell may have been the most important royal official of the 13th century.|$|E

She was rearmed {{with a pair of}} 12-pounder (3 inch, 76mm) guns and depth charges, weapons more suitable for her new role as an anti-submarine patrol boat. Swordfish joined the 1st Destroyer Flotilla at Portsmouth upon completion of her sea trials, but nothing is known of her subsequent service.|$|E

5|$|In {{the late}} 1940s the central vault {{ceiling of the}} main {{sanctuary}} cracked, {{and had to be}} repaired. At that time the pulpit was also rebuilt, so that the rabbi and cantor had separate pulpits. Underneath the sanctuary ran an underground stream which would regularly overflow, leading to flooding problems. The flooding was <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> the 1950s with the installation of check valves, and a concrete slab floor was installed. Though the intent was to provide usable space in the basement, it was rarely used.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton derived this theorem in Propositions 43–45 of Book I of his Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica, first {{published}} in 1687. In Proposition 43, he showed that the added force must be a central force, one whose magnitude depends only upon the distance r between the particle and a point <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> space (the center). In Proposition 44, he derived a formula for the force, showing {{that it was an}} inverse-cube force, one that varies as the inverse cube of r. In Proposition 45 Newton extended his theorem to arbitrary central forces by assuming that the particle moved in nearly circular orbit.|$|E

The Australians were then able to firmly establish themselves at the mission. Meanwhile, the two companies from the 9th Battalion took up positions at Kilarbo and between the Gama River and Homo Creek with orders to establish blocking positions to allow the 2/12th to continue its advance the following morning.|$|E

5|$|Mary Celeste was not {{the first}} {{reported}} case of a ship being found strangely deserted on the high seas. Rupert Gould, a naval officer and investigator of maritime mysteries, lists several such occurrences between 1840 and 1855.

5|$|Space itself {{possesses}} symmetry. It {{looks the}} same no matter how one rotates it, and the resulting rotational symmetry {{is referred to as}} isotropy of space. In the present case it is common to use passive rotations, meaning that the observer rotates themself. Mathematically, the active operation of a rotation is performed by multiplying position vectors by a rotation matrix. A passive rotation is accomplished by rotating only the basis vectors of the coordinate system. (The coordinate system {{can be thought of as}} being <b>fixed</b> <b>in</b> the rotated observer. The observer is physically rotated.) In this way, every point in space obtains new coordinates as if it was somehow physically rigidly rotated.|$|E
