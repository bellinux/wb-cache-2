Between the 14th and 16th centuries, starting in Italy, a diamond-tipped cutter became prevalent which allowed for more precise cutting. Then in 1869 the wheel cutter was developed by Samuel Monce of Bristol, Connecticut, which remains the current standard tool for most glass cutting.|$|E
50|$|A <b>hot</b> <b>point</b> probe is {{a method}} of {{determining}} quickly whether a semiconductor sample is n (negative) type or p (positive) type. A voltmeter or ammeter {{is attached to the}} sample, and a heat source, such as a soldering iron, is placed on one of the leads. The heat source will cause charge carriers (electrons in an n-type, electron holes in a p-type) {{to move away from the}} lead. The heat from the probe creates an increased number of higher energy carriers which then diffuse away from the contact point. This will cause a current/voltage difference. For example, if the heat source is placed on the positive lead of a voltmeter attached to an n-type semiconductor, a positive voltage reading will result as the area around the heat source/positive lead becomes positively charged.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the cooling of batteries. The first step was the thermal {{characterization}} of a single cell of the module, which consists in the detection of the thermal field by means of thermographic tests during electric charging and discharging. The purpose was to identify possible critical <b>hot</b> <b>points</b> and to evaluate the cooling demand during the normal operation of an electric car. After that, {{a study on the}} optimal configuration to obtain the flattening of the temperature profile and to avoid <b>hot</b> <b>points</b> was executed. An experimental plant for cooling capacity evaluation of the batteries, using air as cooling fluid, was realized in our laboratory in ENEA Casaccia. The plant is designed to allow testing at different flow rate and temperatures of the cooling air, useful for the assessment of operative thermal limits in different working conditions. Another experimental facility was built to evaluate the thermal behaviour changes with water as cooling fluid. Experimental tests were carried out on the LiFePO 4 batteries, under different electric working conditions using the two loops. In the future, different type of batteries will be tested and the influence of various parameters on the heat transfer will be assessed for possible optimal operative solutions...|$|R

5000|$|In Transylvania and Banat, several {{sections}} - {{including the}} ones in Cluj, Arad, Brașov, Oradea, Târgu Mureș, and Timișoara - continued to support the General Council, condemned {{the decision of the}} social-democratic faction (which included {{an important part of the}} Transylvanian delegates in the Council), and, on February 12, constituted the Provisional Transylvanian Council of the Romanian Socialist Party in Cluj. The General Council, which had become dominated by communists, reportedly maintained the allegiance of most party members not only in Old Romania (where the movement had traditionally been more to the left), but also in Transylvania and Banat. The last meeting of the Cluj Provisional Committee took place on May 5, when it dissolved itself, relinquishing the power over the Transylvanian sections in favour of the upcoming Congress. As was the case all over the country, most Congress delegations elected by the local sections in Tranyslvania and Banat were dominated by communists. The Congress began in Bucharest on May 8, 1921. One of the main issues was again the affiliation to the Third International. A <b>hot</b> <b>point</b> of the debate was the official letter from the Comintern, considered unfair and overly critical, with many of the speakers contesting some of its accusations. On the evening of May 11, the majority of the delegates however decided for unconditional affiliation to the Communist International (428 mandates, as opposed to 111 mandates supporting the conditional affiliation proposed by the unitary socialists). The following day the Congress adopted the transformation of the party into the Socialist-Communist Party. In the evening of the same day, the police and army intervened in the Congress and arrested all delegates that had supported unconditional affiliation to the Third International, under the accusation of [...] "plot against state security".|$|E

40|$|Observations of {{infrared}} {{and optical}} light curves of hot Jupiters {{have demonstrated that}} the peak brightness is generally offset eastward from the substellar point [1, 2]. This observation is consistent with hydrodynamic numerical simulations that produce fast, eastward directed winds which advect the <b>hottest</b> <b>point</b> in the atmosphere eastward of the substellar point [3, 4]. However, recent continuous Kepler measurements of HAT-P- 7 b show that its peak brightness offset varies significantly in time, with excursions such that the brightest point is sometimes westward of the substellar point [5]. These variations in brightness offset require wind variability, {{with or without the}} presence of clouds. While such wind variability has not been seen in hydrodynamic simulations of hot Jupiter atmospheres, it has been seen in magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) simulations [6]. Here we show that MHD simulations of HAT-P- 7 b indeed display variable winds and corresponding variability in the position of the <b>hottest</b> <b>point</b> in the atmosphere. Assuming the observed variability in HAT-P- 7 b is due to magnetism we constrain its minimum magnetic field strength to be 6 G. Similar observations of wind variability on hot giant exoplanets, or lack thereof, could help constrain their magnetic field strengths. Since dynamo simulations of these planets do not exist and theoretical scaling relations [7] may not apply, such observational constraints could prove immensely useful.
