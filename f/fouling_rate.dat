40|$|Fly ash {{components}} in the flue gas can stick onto heat exchanger tubes and cumulate into solid deposits. This fouling phenomenon is a common issue in fluidized bed boilers, where challenging fuels with possibly high and challenging ash content are often fired in. Basic characteristics of the phenomenon are discussed briefly, followed by a short review {{of research on the}} methods of modelling and predicting fouling tendency. A method to examine fouling through heat transfer calculations was tested in this thesis. Primary aim was to verify applicability of this selected method in real large-scale boilers via performing a retrospective analysis on earlier measurement data. Reference clean state heat transfer coefficients of certain heat exchangers were compared to calculated states by using data from control system log files, and the comparisons were formulated into thermal resistances of the deposit layer. The control system log files contained data from earlier measurement campaigns. Calculated thermal resistances increased along cumulating deposition, until a cleansing soot blowing pulse is actuated. Slopes of these rising thermal resistance curves were extracted, forming estimates of <b>fouling</b> <b>rates</b> per each <b>fouling</b> period. Calculated thermal resistance build-ups matched soot blowing operation times well with only a few exceptions, and so the selected method seemed to express actual fouling decently in general. Calculated resistances and <b>fouling</b> <b>rates</b> were compared to other operational factors, including main steam power, fuel feed variation and measured flue gas pressure change at studied heat exchangers. Certain findings were made, even though available data was not completely sufficient. While decent correlation with slight steam power changes was not identifiable, studying the flue gas pressure change showed very evident relation with thermal resistances.

However, the nitritation {{is limited by}} the low growth rates of ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB). In this study, a membrane bioreactor (MBR) was operated for 300 days to assess its nitritation performance and the shift of microbial community. Results showed that the reactor obtained satisfying nitritation after a startup period of 50 days, which finally achieved ammonium conversation rates of about 0. 8 kg N/m(3) /d. The apparent half-saturation constant (K-m) and maximum ammonium oxidation rate (r(max)) of the AOB-enriched culture were determined to be 6. 1 mg N/L and 1. 1 kg N/g-VSS/d, respectively. In addition, lower <b>fouling</b> <b>rates</b> were found in the initial operating days that the reactor was fed with lower ammonium loads (day 0 -day 150). However, the increased ammonium loads (> 0. 6 kg N/m(3) /d) in the following 150 days resulted in increases in extracellular polysaccharides, leading to much higher <b>fouling</b> <b>rates.</b> 16 S rRNA high-throughput sequencing analysis showed clear changes in the microbial community populations during the MBR operation.

Moreover, the AOB-enriched culture was of higher microbial diversity than the seeding sludge.

40|$|In this study, {{a method}} of in situ {{membrane}} fouling quantification is developed that enables comparisons of foulant accumulation between desalination processes with different membranes, driving forces, and feed solutions. Unlike the conventional metric of flux decline, which measures the response of a process to fouling, the proposed method quantifies the foulant accumulation. Foulant accumulation is parameterized by two variables, cake structural parameter and hydraulic diameter, that are calculated from flux measurements using a model for salt and water transport through fouled reverse osmosis (RO) and forward osmosis (FO) membranes, including dispersive mass transfer in the FO membrane support layer. Model results show that pressure declines through the foulant layer and can, in FO, reach negative absolute values at the membrane. Experimental alginate gel <b>fouling</b> <b>rates</b> are measured within a range of feed ionic compositions where cake hydraulic resistance is negligible. Using both flux decline and cake structural parameter as metrics, the effect of feed salinity on RO fouling is tested and RO is compared to FO. When RO is fouled with alginate, feed salinity and membrane permeability affect flux decline but not foulant accumulation rate. Between FO and RO, the initial rates of foulant accumulation are similar; however, FO exhibits slower flux decline, which causes greater foulant accumulation over time.

40|$|Fouling is the {{build-up}} of undesired deposits on surfaces. In {{the dairy}} industry, fouling is mainly seen in heat exchangers where dairy fluid is heated or concentrated. It {{is one of}} the primary reasons for restricted run length, causing financial losses from downtime, the use of cleaning chemicals and reduced product quality. Fouling is a complex process and is due to number of factors including the properties of the heat transfer surface. A silica based coating is known to alter the surface properties. This study was carried out to investigate the effect of a silica based coating on fouling by whole milk in a falling film evaporator. Seven independent trials were conducted. In each trial, a control run was carried out followed by a full cleaning of the equipment and then either another control run or a coating run with pasteurized milk from the same batch. There was a six hour interval between the start of the control run and start of the coating run.

The flow in channels of plate heat exchangers (PHEs) has high levels of turbulence due to the channels intricate geometry.
