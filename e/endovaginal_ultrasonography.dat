40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} anatomical {{and functional}} pelvic floor measurements performed with three-dimensional (3 -D) <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> in asymptomatic nulliparous women without dysfunctions detected in previous dynamic 3 -D anorectal ultrasonography (echo defecography) and {{to demonstrate the}} interobserver reliability of these measurements. METHODS: Asymptomatic nulliparous volunteers were submitted to echo defecography to identify dynamic dysfunctions, including anatomical (rectocele, intussusceptions, entero/sigmoidocele and perineal descent) and functional changes (non-relaxation or paradoxical contraction of the puborectalis muscle) in the posterior compartment and assessed {{with regard to the}} biometric index of levator hiatus, pubovisceral muscle thickness, urethral length, anorectal angle, anorectal junction position and bladder neck position with the 3 -D <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> All measurements were compared at rest and during the Valsalva maneuver, and perineal and bladder neck descent was determined. The level of interobserver agreement was evaluated for all measurements. RESULTS: A total of 34 volunteers were assessed by echo defecography and by 3 -D <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> Out of these, 20 subjects met the inclusion criteria. The 14 excluded subjects were found to have posterior dynamic dysfunctions. During the Valsalva maneuver, the hiatal area was significantly larger, the urethra was significantly shorter and the anorectal angle was greater. Measurements at rest and during the Valsalva maneuver differed significantly with regard to anorectal junction and bladder neck position. The mean values for normal perineal descent and bladder neck descent were 0. 6 cm and 0. 5 cm above the symphysis pubis, respectively. The intraclass correlation coefficient ranged from 0. 62 - 0. 93. CONCLUSIONS: Functional biometric indexes, normal perineal descent and bladder neck descent values were determined for young asymptomatic nulliparous women with the 3 -D <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> The method was found to be reliable to measure pelvic floor structures at rest and during Valsalva, and might therefore be suitable for identifying dysfunctions in symptomatic patients...|$|E
30|$|In a large prospective, open {{study in}} 400 post-menopausal women, the endometrial safety and breast density were studied {{before and after}} a 52 -week CRE {{treatment}} (Rauš et al. 2006). No case of hyperplasia occurred and no serious adverse endometrial outcomes were found, indicating endometrial safety.

An increase in breast density was found in only one woman who was diagnosed with invasive breast cancer which, based on history, was unrelated to the CR.|$|E
40|$|Objective: The {{purpose of}} this study was to assess endometriomas and {{follicular}} cysts using a new quantitative method provided by the picture archiving and communication system. Materials and Methods: We reviewed our computer ultrasound database of endometriomas and follicular cysts between November 2003 and July 2007. A total of 123 consecutive women diagnosed with an endometrioma or follicular cyst on two-dimensional sonography were re-evaluated using new parameters with the picture archiving and communication system. We chose quantitative tumor density and standard deviation on sonographic images as the new diagnostic parameters. Analysis of variance and Scheffé post hoc test were analyzed to compare the mean tumor density of the endometriomas and follicular cysts. The receiver operating characteristic curve was plotted to choose the cutoff value of the endometrioma tumor density with the best sensitivity and specificity. Results: There was a significant difference when the tumor density of the follicular cyst and endometrioma groups was compared using the vaginal, abdominal or endovaginal approach (p < 0. 001). Based on the results of the receiver operating characteristic curve, <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> is an excellent diagnostic tool with which to evaluate endometriomas. With <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> examination, the best cutoff value of tumor density is 28 and the sensitivity and specificity are 64 % and 100 %, respectively. Conclusion: The use of quantitative tumor density and standard deviation on sonographic images is a potential new diagnostic tool in the assessment of endometriomas and follicular cysts...|$|E
40|$|Three-dimensional {{ultrasonography}} {{in power}} Doppler mode (3 D power Doppler) allows the appropriate {{quantitative assessment of}} the ovarian tissue vascularization. the present case is of an ovarian torsion in a pregnant woman at 6. 5 weeks with ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome due to in vitro fertilization. Gray-scale images of <b>endovaginal</b> two-dimensional <b>ultrasonography</b> revealed enlargement of the right ovary and multiple peripheral follicles. Two-dimensional ultrasonography in color Doppler mode revealed the absence of venous flow and reduction in arterial flow to the impaired ovary. 3 D power Doppler allowed the appropriate quantitative assessment of tissue vessel density of the impaired ovary, which greatly influenced the decision for conservative surgical treatment. the 3 D power Doppler assessment performed after the surgery confirmed {{the integrity of the}} ovarian tissue. 3 D power Doppler can help in the selection of patients with ovarian torsion for conservative surgical treatment.

40|$|CONTEXT: Uterine myomas are benign tumors that mostly {{occur in}} women of {{reproductive}} age at a frequency ranging from 20 to 25 %. The symptoms are increased menstrual flow, pain and compressive signs. New treatments {{have been proposed}} and uterine artery embolization is one of them. OBJECTIVE: To evaluate the effects of treatment by embolization of the uterine artery, in women with symptomatic myomas. Uterine and dominant myoma volumes and the major symptoms were evaluated before treatment and 12 weeks later. TYPE OF STUDY: Open clinical trial. SETTING: A tertiary-care women's hospital. PARTICIPANTS: The study was conducted on 32 women with symptomatic single or multiple myomas of the uterine body, seen at the outpatient unit from May 2000 to September 2001. MAIN MEASUREMENTS: The patients were submitted to gynecological examination and abdominal and <b>endovaginal</b> pelvic <b>ultrasonography,</b> and the examinations were repeated 12 weeks after the first procedure. Uterine artery embolization using PVA (polyvinyl alcohol) particles of 355 - 700 µ was performed by catheterization of the right femoral artery in 30 women and by bilateral catheterization in two. RESULTS: Before embolization, the mean uterine volume of the 32 women was 455 cm³ and the mean volume of the dominant myoma was 150 cm³. Twelve weeks after embolization, the mean uterine volume was 256 cm³ and the mean volume of the dominant myoma was 91 cm³, with p < 0. 01 in both cases. Twelve weeks after the treatment, all the women answered a questionnaire, which showed that 71 % had improvement in menstrual regularity, 90 % decreased menstrual volume and 81 % shortened menstrual duration. The most frequent immediate post-procedure symptoms, established as complications, were pain (100 %) and fatigue (34 %). One woman had myoma degeneration and was submitted to myomectomy. CONCLUSION: The significant reduction in uterine and dominant myoma volume confirms {{the validity of the}} treatment of symptomatic myomas by the technique of uterine artery embolization in Brazilian women. There was significant reduction in menstrual flow and duration, as well as better cycle regularity in the women studied. The few adverse effects observed in the sample studied mainly involved pain immediately after embolization...|$|R
40|$|Ovarian cancer {{accounts}} for a minority of female cancers but remains {{the leading cause of}} death from gynaecologic cancers and the fifth leading cause of all cancer-related deaths among women. More than two thirds of cases of ovarian cancer are diagnosed once the disease becomes symptomatic, i. e. at an advanced stage. Though early detection constitutes a legitimate aim, no screening approach has yet been shown to reduce ovarian cancer mortality. In particular, ovarian imagery with <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> and serum tumor markers (CA- 125) dosage performed in asymptomatic individuals have not proven their efficacy. Screening of asymptomatic women is not therefore recommended because of the limited prevalence of ovarian cancer in the general population...|$|E
30|$|Despite the {{availability}} of accurate diagnostic algorithms {{for the detection of}} ectopic pregnancy (EP), choosing the best treatment when EP is suspected can still pose a dilemma in daily practice. This dilemma arises in particular when patients without any clinical symptoms are diagnosed with EP. The latter tends to happen more often due to {{the availability}} of sensitive serum beta human chorionic gonadotrophin (beta-hCG) tests and high-resolution <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> that allows us to detect EP in early pregnancy even before clinical symptoms have the chance to set in [1, 2]. Consequently, early intervention has become a possibility and could potentially prevent serious complications. However, a considerable number of the EPs can also resolve spontaneously and treatment is not always necessary [3 – 5]. Inherently, early detection and quick intervention could result in overtreatment.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Most {{patients}} with early-stage endometrial carcinoma {{are treated with}} hysterectomy. The knowledge of the stage of disease could impact greatly on the eventual therapeutic decision. Numerous studies have investigated the use of <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> (US) and magnetic resonance (MR) imaging in the preoperative staging of endometrial carcinoma. Although {{a number of studies}} have demonstrated no significant difference in the accuracy of MR imaging and endovaginal US in assessing myometrial invasion, more recently, dynamic contrast-enhanced MR imaging has been found to be significantly superior to the non-enhanced T 2 -weighted MR imaging in the preoperative evaluation of endometrial carcinoma. Purpose. (1) To evaluate prospectively the relative accuracy of endovaginal US (including Doppler) and MR imaging using phased array pelvic multicoil in the preoperative staging of endometrial carcinoma with histopathological correlation on the same patient population, (2) To determine whether the addition of contrast-enhanced MR sequences to high resolution fast spinecho (FSE) T 2 -weighted sequences, can improve the diagnostic accuracy of staging endometrial carcinoma.

40|$|Abstract Background Planning the {{surgical}} strategy for a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) at the posterior {{wall of the}} lower rectum is difficult, as the procedures for the lower rectum are hampered by poor visualization and may cause anal dysfunction or discomfort. We report a novel procedure to resect a submucosal tumor of the rectum. Case presentation A 75 -year-old woman presented with metrorrhagia. <b>Endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> showed a low echoic tumor. Computed tomography showed an enhanced tumor, measuring 5. 32 ̆ 00972 ̆ 0094. 20 cm, behind the rectum. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a submucosal tumor of the rectum, measuring 5. 30 cm at its greatest dimension. Colonoscopy showed that the distal tumor margin was 10 cm above the dentate line. Core needle biopsy of the tumor revealed the rectal GIST. After receiving neoadjuvant imatinib treatment, the tumor size decreased to 3. 50 cm. During the operation, we approached the rectum and resected the posterior rectal wall, including the 3. 52 ̆ 00972 ̆ 0093. 50 cm tumor with a safety margin, making an arched incision at the buttocks to form a skin flap with the patient in a jackknife position. The histopathological diagnosis was GIST of the rectum. Her anorectal sphincter function was well preserved. No recurrence was seen during the 2 -year follow-up. Conclusions This novel approach improves the operative field visibility in resecting a tumor with a safety margin and preserves a patient 2 ̆ 019 s anorectal sphincter function...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: quantificar os valores do líquido amniótico no primeiro trimestre da gestação, em fetos normais, por meio de ultra-sonografia {{tridimensional}} e bidimensional. MÉTODOS: foram avaliados 25 fetos normais, da 8 ª à 11 ª semana de gestação. O estudo foi do tipo prospectivo longitudinal. As medidas do volume de líquido amniótico foram obtidas por meio de ultra-sonografia endovaginal, modos tridimensional e bidimensional. O estudo bidimensional consistiu em determinar o volume por cálculo matemático com base na forma de um elipsóide (constante 0, 52), obtendo-se o volume do saco amniótico e do embrião. No estudo tridimensional, o volume do líquido amniótico foi feito pela técnica VOCAL, utilizando os graus de rotação 6, 9, 15 e 30 °. Foi considerado como resultado final o volume do líquido amniótico obtido pelo grau de rotação 6. Em ambos, o volume de líquido amniótico foi obtido pela subtração do volume do saco amniótico pela medida volumétrica do embrião. Para análise estatística utilizamos análise de variância (ANOVA), correlação e análise de regressão. O nível de significância adotado foi p PURPOSE: To {{determine the}} values of amniotic fluid in normal fetuses during the first trimester of pregnancy by three- and bi-dimensional ultrasonography. METHODS: In a prospective longitudinal study, 25 normal fetuses were evaluated from the 8 th to the 11 th week of gestation. Amniotic fluid volume was measured by <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography</b> with the three- and two-dimensional modes. The two-dimensional study consisted of volumetric determination by mathematical calculation based on an ellipsoidal shape (constant 0. 52) to obtain the amniotic sac and embryo volumes. In the three-dimensional study, the amniotic fluid volume {{was determined by the}} VOCAL technique using 6, 9, 15, and 30 degrees of rotation. The amniotic fluid volume obtained by 6 -degree rotations was considered to be the final result. In both modes, amniotic fluid volume was obtained by subtracting the volume of the embryo from the volume of the amniotic sac. Data were analyzed statistically for variance (ANOVA), correlation and regression analysis. The level of significance was set at p < 0. 05. RESULTS: The amniotic fluid volume as measured by two-dimensional ultrasonography increased from 5. 45 to 39. 52 cm³ in the range from the 8 th to the 11 th week (ANOVA - p < 0. 05). There was a correlation between gestational age and amniotic fluid volume (p < 0. 001, r² = 88. 3 %). In the three-dimensional study, the amniotic fluid volume increased from 5. 7 to 42. 9 cm³ in the range from the 8 th to the 11 th week (ANOVA - p < 0. 05), and again a correlation between gestational age and amniotic fluid volume (p < 0. 001, r² = 98. 1 %) was observed. CONCLUSION: an increase in amniotic fluid volume occurs during the first trimester of pregnancy, as determined by the two- and three-dimensional modes. In addition, we have demonstrated that the higher the gestational age, the larger the amniotic fluid volume...|$|E
40|$|Objetivos: avaliar aspectos clínicos e ultra-sonográficos de tumores pélvicos na pós-menopausa e correlacioná-los com o diagnóstico final. Pacientes e Métodos: foram seguidas prospectivamente 36 mulheres menopausadas com diagnóstico de tumor pélvico com avaliação clínica e ultra-sonografia endovaginal. Foi definida conduta de observação em tumores císticos anecóicos e/ou com septo fino único e volume {{inferior}} a 50 cm³. Foi realizada punção em tumores com as mesmas características e volume entre 50 e 100 cm³ e laparotomia exploradora para os demais casos. O diagnóstico final definiu dois grupos de pacientes: patologia benigna (28) e maligna (8). Resultados: tumores císticos anecóicos com septo fino único são indicativos de benignidade (p = 0, 0091), ao passo que a presença de tumor com áreas sólidas (mistos) é indicativa de malignidade (p = 0, 0024). Ascite correlacionou-se com tumores malignos (p = 0, 0278). Heterogeneidade do tumor, espessamento de cápsula, septação grosseira e vegetação prevalecem nos casos malignos mas sem significância (p > 0, 05). O volume tumoral é parâmetro indicativo de malignidade com mediana de 85, 2 cm³ em benignos e 452, 5 cm³ em malignos (p = 0, 0048), estabelecendo-se corte em 295 cm³ (sensibilidade = 83, 3 % e especificidade = 85, 2 %). Com estes critérios todas pacientes com tumores malignos foram submetidas à laparotomia e 11 pacientes com tumores benignos foram tratadas de forma conservadora (39, 3 % dos casos benignos). Conclusão: a conduta conservadora é adequada a mulheres com tumores pélvicos de pequeno volume, anecóicos ou com septo fino, sem ascite. A diferenciação de tumores complexos e/ou volumosos benignos e malignos necessita de investigação complementar. Purpose: {{to evaluate}} clinical and ultrasonic findings {{in patients with}} pelvic tumors at postmenopause and to correlate them with the final diagnosis. Patients and Methods: thirty-six postmenopausal women with pelvic tumor diagnosis were prospectively evaluated through clinical examination and <b>endovaginal</b> <b>ultrasonography.</b> Clinical follow-up with no surgical procedures was indicated for anechoic cystic tumors with or without thin unique septation and volume under 50 cm³. Needle aspiration was indicated for tumors with the same aspect, and volume of 50 to 100 cm³, whereas exploratory laparotomy was performed in the remaining patients. Diagnosis defined two groups of patients: benign (28) and malignant (8) pathologies. Results: anechoic cystic tumor {{with or without a}} thin septum indicates benignity (p = 0. 0091). Tumors with solid areas indicate malignancy (p = 0. 0024). Ascites correlates with malignancy (p = 0. 0278). Heterogeneity, thick capsule, thick septa, and papillary projections predominated in malignancies but without no statistical significance (p > 0, 05). Tumor volume indicates malignancy, with a median of 85. 2 cm³ in benign tumors and 452. 5 cm³ in malignancies (p = 0. 0048), with a cutoff at 295 cm³ (sensitivity = 83. 3 % and specificity = 85. 2 %). Following this protocol, all malignancies were submitted to surgery and 11 benign tumor patients were treated with a conservative protocol (39. 3 % of all benign patients). Conclusion: conservative management is an adequate protocol for women with anechoic pelvic tumors with low volume, with or without single thin septum and without ascites. Differentiation between benign and malignant of complex and/or high volume tumors requires complementary investigation...|$|E
