5|$|Evolves environments {{are based}} on Earth's as the <b>design</b> <b>team</b> {{wanted to create a}} world that felt {{believable}} for players and had regions that made geological sense after an early concept design was found to be too extreme. As a result, the <b>design</b> <b>team</b> drew inspiration from real-world landscapes. The <b>design</b> <b>team</b> wanted Evolve to be set in lush forests so that Hunters and Monsters could hide from each other. The <b>design</b> <b>team</b> tried using the Source game engine to create a forest landscape but they ultimately failed. The <b>design</b> <b>team</b> then researched Crytek's CryEngine, which powers games like Far Cry and Crysis. As the <b>design</b> <b>team</b> felt that Far Cry and Crysis set new standards for in-game environments, they decided to utilize CryEngine for Evolve. Evolves maps were designed to be dark and mysterious, so that the various characters can hide from each other, as well as presenting a sense of surprise when players are ambushed.|$|E
5|$|As Evolve is multiplayer-focused, the <b>design</b> <b>team</b> put {{less time}} and focus into {{developing}} Evolves narrative and campaign. Conversations between characters were reduced during the multiplayer mode as the <b>design</b> <b>team</b> {{thought that it}} would negatively impact on the conversations between players. However, the story and narrative became more significant in the single-player mode. Evolve does not adapt traditional storytelling methods, nor use a campaign mode, instead, players learn about the Hunters' backstory and the fictional world of Shear by slowly progressing through Evolve. Playing as different characters would also lead to different conversations and dialogues between characters.|$|E

40|$|<b>Design</b> <b>teams</b> in {{industry}} {{are composed of}} individuals with diverse backgrounds at various stages of their careers. A unique set of group dynamics will be created with one member, likely someone with sufficient experience, assuming the responsibility of being the <b>team</b> leader. <b>Design</b> <b>teams</b> formed in engineering classes within the university setting typically consist of individuals at the same stage of their academic training, thus students do not experience the same group dynamics as they will find {{in industry}}. In an attempt to give undergraduate engineering students this experience, inter-year <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> were formed from engineering students registered in courses representing different stages of completion of the engineering degree. Students registered in the final-year design course were expected to assume the roles of team leaders or co-leaders. This paper will discuss {{a number of issues}} that were observed with inter-year capstone <b>design</b> <b>teams.</b> It has been concluded that the disadvantages of inter-year <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> outweigh the advantages...|$|R

5|$|On 24 April 2017, rumours of Creative Assembly {{producing}} a sequel were published by PSU.com. However, Eurogamer later {{pointed out that}} the rumour is likely false, as much of the original <b>design</b> <b>team</b> behind Alien: Isolation were no longer with Creative Assembly.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the {{completion}} of Age of Empires, Ensemble Studios had {{signed a contract with}} Microsoft for a sequel. The <b>design</b> <b>team</b> chose to set The Age of Kings in the Middle Ages as a logical progression from the ancient era setting of Age of Empires. The <b>design</b> <b>team</b> was conscious of attempting to capture the broad appeal of the first game without making the game's design too similar. Nonetheless, they attempted to appeal to the vast demographic who played Age of Empires. The Age of Kingss <b>design</b> <b>team</b> intended to complete the game within a year by using code from the original and reusing the Genie game engine. Several months into the process they found they {{would not be able to}} complete a game of the quality they sought in that time. Ensemble Studios informed Microsoft they would need another year and instead created , an easily developed expansion pack of Age of Empires, as a compromise which could be released for Christmas 1998. To help meet the next year's deadline, additional programmers, artists, and designers were employed. To overcome another significant objection to Age of Empires—that of path finding—the team completely redesigned the game engine's movement system.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{discusses}} {{a cooperative}} engineering design {{process in which}} the <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> cooperate on <b>design</b> of engineering subsystems in order to optimize the performance of the entire system. We describe models for software systems supporting such engineering design. The software system consists of several coordination software modules that allow <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> to cooperate in the process of specifying or changing design decisions in any phase of the design process. Different interaction modes between the <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> are described. The implementation of such software system in the Internet environment is discussed...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{information}} environment of <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> is discussed {{because of the}} use of Internet based Project websites (PWS) to improve the information exchange within <b>design</b> <b>teams.</b> Because <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> heavenly depend on informal information exchange and PWS is a tool for formalising information exchange the question is how a PWS can be used effectively within deign environments. To get a more holistic view on the information environment of <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> Davenport’s model for Information ecology is used (Davenport, 1997). The design organisation of DGW 2 ̆ 6 amp;T of the Ministry of Defense in the Netherlands is described by using the different aspects of information ecology. Finally informal information exchange processes within DGW 2 ̆ 6 amp;T are discussed as well as possibilities for improvement of information handling...|$|R

5|$|Although Max Allan Collins (then a Dick Tracy comic-strip writer) had {{conflicts}} with Disney concerning the novelization, {{he gave a}} positive review for the finished film. He praised Beatty for hiring an elaborate <b>design</b> <b>team</b> and his decision to mimic the strip's limited color palette. Collins also enjoyed Beatty's performance, both the prosthetic makeup and characterization of the rogues gallery, {{as well as the}} Stephen Sondheim music. However, he believed the filmmakers still sacrificed the storyline in favor of the visual design.|$|E
5|$|Development began {{soon after}} the release of Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The game {{introduced}} a shift to a more realistic and detailed style and tone for the series. Unlike previous entries, Grand Theft Auto IV had no strong cinematic influence, as the team attempted an original approach to the story. As part of their research for the open world, the developers conducted field research around New York throughout development and captured footage for the <b>design</b> <b>team.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the early}} stages of development, in-game {{dialogue}} was recorded in Los Angeles by local Asian actors, but much of the audio was then re-recorded in Hong Kong through Drum Music, a specialist recording company. Audio design was complicated; scripting was handled in Vancouver and the recording was in Hong Kong. There were reservations among the developers about the language for the background dialogue; the sound <b>design</b> <b>team</b> eventually prevailed in using Hong Kong Cantonese over English.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the impact of teacher <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> as a professional development arrangement for developing technology integration knowledge and skills among in-service science teachers. The study was conducted at a secondary school in Tanzania, where 12 in-service science teachers participated in a workshop about technology integration in science teaching and worked in <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> to prepare technology-enhanced biology, chemistry and physics lessons. Through collaboration in <b>design</b> <b>teams,</b> teachers {{were able to make}} science animations using PowerPoint and record videos to use in their teaching. The designed lessons were taught in the classroom and reflected upon thereafter by all teachers. In order to determine the change in teachers’ technology integration knowledge and skills, data were collected before and after the professional development arrangement by using questionnaire, interview and observation data. Focus group discussion and reflection questionnaire data were used to assess teachers’ experience of working in <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> {{at the end of the}} professional development arrangement. Findings showed an increase in teachers’ technology integration knowledge and skills between pre- and post-measurements. Collaboration in <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> had the potential for teachers to share knowledge, skills, experience and challenges related to technology-enhanced teaching...|$|R

5|$|A <b>design</b> <b>team</b> {{was formed}} in 1946 under the {{leadership}} of chief designer Ronald Bishop, who had been responsible for the Mosquito fighter-bomber. A number of unorthodox configurations were considered, ranging from canard to tailless designs; all were subsequently rejected. The Ministry of Supply was, however, interested in the most radical of the proposed designs and ordered two experimental tailless DH 108s to serve as proof of concept aircraft for testing swept-wing configurations in both low-speed and high-speed flight. During flight tests, the DH 108 gained a reputation for being accident-prone and unstable, leading de Havilland and BOAC to gravitate to conventional configurations and, necessarily, designs with less technical risk. The DH 108s were later modified to test the DH 106's power controls.|$|E
5|$|A {{shortage}} of engines {{was a major}} obstacle to mass production {{and development of the}} IK-3, so tests were conducted with more powerful engines, including the Daimler-Benz DB 601, Rolls-Royce Merlin II and Hispano-Suiza 12Y51. The tests were incomplete {{at the time of the}} Axis invasion, and the only prototype to be fitted with a non-production engine was destroyed by factory personnel along with the incomplete production aircraft. Development of a dual-control two-seat trainer variant of the IK-3 had commenced but pressure on the <b>design</b> <b>team</b> had delayed the completion of the project when the invasion intervened.|$|E
5|$|After the Hollywood {{theme was}} decided on, the <b>design</b> <b>team</b> {{drew up a}} map and {{assigned}} objects and puzzles to different areas. The game was originally designed for the ZX Spectrum and then ported to the Amstrad CPC, due to the systems' similar architecture. However, the team struggled to port the game to the Commodore 64 due to it being a different machine altogether. The finished game is significantly changed from the incomplete Movieland Dizzy, which featured only film sets as locations, the surrounding film studio and backlots were not present. The real-world studio elements were added after Dizzy was disassociated from the game.|$|E

5|$|Although the game's {{development}} {{appeared to}} be proceeding towards completion without difficulty, LucasArts abruptly canceled production of Freelance Police in March 2004, citing economic and market conditions. The game's cancellation was received poorly by fans of the series, Steve Purcell, and the video game industry media. Many journalists viewed this move as a culmination in {{the decline of the}} adventure game genre. LucasArts later terminated its adventure game development, and many of the Freelance Police <b>design</b> <b>team</b> left to create Telltale Games and continue development of such adventure games.

40|$|Abstract: The {{complexity}} of engineering systems is rapidly increasing {{because the number}} of components has increased and various engineering disciplines are involved. According to this trend, large-scale engineering systems are designed by multiple <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> with many designers of various disciplines. Although the design process by the <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> is a great deal similar to the design process by an individual designer, there is an important difference between them. Designing a large-scale engineering system with <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> can cause potential conflict among the subsystems because each <b>team</b> may <b>design</b> a subsystem without considering the other team’s subsystems. In this article, a collaborative design process is proposed to design a large-scale engineering system efficiently without the conflict among the subsystems using the Independence Axiom of axiomatic design. The proposed process uses a zigzagging process between the functional domain and the physical domain, and the online electric vehicle (OLEV) is designed by the proposed process. The OLEV is an electric vehicle which uses electric power transmitted wirelessly from the power source buried in the road. The functional requirements (FRs) and constraints of the OLEV are specified to clarify the design objectives and specifications. The prototype, which is designed by the <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> based on the defined FRs, is evaluated using the proposed process. It is found that the proposed process can lead <b>design</b> <b>teams</b> to <b>design</b> a product more efficiently without unnecessary iterations...|$|R
