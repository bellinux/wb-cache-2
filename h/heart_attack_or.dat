5|$|Studies {{have not}} found an overall benefit in the general {{population}} of healthy people, although it is possible that there are small benefits for those at especially high risk, despite never having had a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke in the past. One study found that among those who have never had a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke, taking aspirin daily for 1 year prevents 1 in 1,667 from having a non-fatal <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke, but caused 1 in 3,333 to have a non-fatal bleeding event. However, the study population were at relatively higher risk than those who had never had a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke.|$|E
5|$|Borislow {{died from}} an {{apparent}} <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> myocardial infarction on July 21, 2014.|$|E
5|$|For {{people who}} have already had a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke, taking aspirin daily for two years {{prevented}} 1 in 50 from having a cardiovascular problem (heart attack, stroke, or death), but also caused non-fatal bleeding problems to occur in 1 of 400 people.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{fish oil}} {{supplement}} studies {{have failed to}} support claims of preventing <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> strokes.|$|R
50|$|While prior sulfonylureas were {{associated}} with worse outcomes, newer agents {{do not appear to}} increase the risk of death, <b>heart</b> <b>attacks,</b> <b>or</b> strokes.|$|R
50|$|Wilson {{recognized}} the need for functional exercise, especially for moderately active seniors or those managing chronic conditions or needing rehabilitation from strokes, <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> other injuries.|$|R
5|$|Kevin Nash was {{released}} from the hospital following Bound for Glory. Medical personnel stated he had {{what appeared to be a}} minor <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> was on the verge of having one when he called 9-1-1. The original plan was to have Nash and Raven start a rivalry after Bound for Glory, but due to the circumstances this was changed.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{appears to}} offer little benefit to those at {{lower risk of}} <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke—for instance, those without a history of these events or with {{pre-existing}} disease. Some studies recommend aspirin on a case-by-case basis, while others have suggested the risks of other events, such as gastrointestinal bleeding, were enough to outweigh any potential benefit, and recommended against using aspirin for primary prevention entirely. Aspirin has also been suggested {{as a component of}} a polypill for prevention of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
5|$|Agent Mitchell Loeb (Chance Kelly), {{a friend}} of Broyles (Lance Reddick), is on a group mission in Weymouth, Massachusetts but fails to find {{evidence}} of wrongdoing in a truck they targeted. Loeb and Broyles are in a meeting afterwards when Loeb collapses, seemingly of a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> seizure. He is rushed to the hospital, where the medical staff cut open his chest, only to find his heart is being constricted by a synthetic rhizocephalan like parasite. The Fringe division of Olivia, Walter, and Peter are briefed by Broyles, who then shows them the hospitalized Loeb.|$|E
50|$|EPA is a {{polyunsaturated}} {{fatty acid}} (PUFA) {{that acts as a}} precursor for prostaglandin-3 (which inhibits platelet aggregation), thromboxane-3, and leukotriene-5 eicosanoids. Studies of fish oil supplements, which contain EPA, have failed to support claims of preventing <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> strokes.|$|R
50|$|Hypertension {{develops}} {{more often}} in those who experience job strain and who have shift-work. Differences {{between women and men}} in risk are small, however men risk suffering and dieing of <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> stroke twice as often as women during working life.|$|R
5000|$|The {{hospital}} {{received the}} [...] "Guidelines—Coronary Artery Disease Gold Performance Achievement Award," [...] recognizing {{a higher standard}} of cardiac care that improves the treatment of patients hospitalized with coronary disease and reduces their risk of recurrent <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> death, from the American Heart Association (2009).|$|R
5|$|Aspirin {{is used in}} the {{treatment}} of a number of conditions, including fever, pain, rheumatic fever, and inflammatory diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis, pericarditis, and Kawasaki disease. Lower doses of aspirin have also been shown {{to reduce the risk of}} death from a <b>heart</b> <b>attack,</b> <b>or</b> the risk of stroke in some circumstances. There is some evidence that aspirin is effective at preventing colorectal cancer, though the mechanisms of this effect are unclear. In the United States low dose aspirin is deemed reasonable in those between 50 and 70 years old who have a more than 10% risk of cardiovascular disease and are not at an increased risk of bleeding who are otherwise healthy.|$|E
5|$|SAH {{is often}} {{associated}} with a poor outcome. The death rate (mortality) for SAH is between 40 and 50 percent, but trends for survival are improving. Of those that survive hospitalization, more than a quarter have significant restrictions in their lifestyle, and less than a fifth have no residual symptoms whatsoever. Delay in diagnosis of minor SAH (mistaking the sudden headache for migraine) contributes to poor outcome. Factors found on admission that are associated with poorer outcome include poorer neurological grade; systolic hypertension; a previous diagnosis of <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> SAH; liver disease; more blood and larger aneurysm on the initial CT scan; location of an aneurysm in the posterior circulation; and higher age. Factors that carry a worse prognosis during the hospital stay include occurrence of delayed ischemia resulting from vasospasm, development of intracerebral hematoma, or intraventricular hemorrhage (bleeding into the ventricles of the brain) and presence of fever on the eighthday of admission.|$|E
25|$|In summary, the APPROVe study {{suggested}} that long-term use of rofecoxib resulted in {{nearly twice the}} risk of suffering a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke compared to patients receiving a placebo.|$|E
50|$|The labels also warn of {{the risk}} of clots forming and causing <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> strokes, high blood {{pressure}} including hypertensive crisis, osteonecrosis of the jaw, severe diarrhea, skin sloughing off the palms and soles, a syndrome with headaches, confusion, loss of vision, and seizures, and protein appearing in urine.|$|R
50|$|Reviews {{support a}} {{short-term}} effect of lowering blood pressure by consuming cocoa products, {{but there is}} no evidence of long-term cardiovascular health benefit. While daily consumption of cocoa flavanols (minimum dose of 200 mg) appears to benefit platelet and vascular function, there is no good evidence to support an effect on <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> strokes.|$|R
50|$|Specifically {{the risk}} of stroke was also {{increased}} by exposure to ionizing radiation. Hypertension develops more often in those who experience job strain and who have shift-work. Differences {{between women and men}} in risk are small, however men risk suffering and dying of <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> stroke twice as often as women during working life.|$|R
25|$|According to United States data, 2004, {{for about}} 65% {{of men and}} 47% of women, the first symptom of {{cardiovascular}} disease is myocardial infarction (<b>heart</b> <b>attack)</b> <b>or</b> sudden death (death within one hour of symptom onset).|$|E
25|$|According to United States {{data for}} 2004, in about 66% {{of men and}} 47% of women, the first symptom of {{atherosclerotic}} cardiovascular disease is a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> sudden cardiac death (death within one hour of onset of the symptom).|$|E
25|$|After {{retiring}} as Comptroller General, McCarl practiced law in Washington, D.C. He suffered {{either a}} <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> a stroke {{at his desk}} in his law office on August 2, 1940, and died immediately. His wife, Ethel, survived him. The couple had no children.|$|E
25|$|When Edsel Ford, President of Ford Motor Company, died {{of cancer}} in May 1943, the elderly and ailing Henry Ford decided to assume the presidency. By this point in his life, he had had several {{cardiovascular}} events (variously cited as <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> strokes) and was mentally inconsistent, suspicious, and generally no longer fit for such immense responsibilities.|$|R
50|$|A more {{controversial}} link is that between Chlamydophila pneumoniae infection and atherosclerosis. While this intracellular organism {{has been demonstrated}} in atherosclerotic plaques, evidence is inconclusive {{as to whether it}} can be considered a causative factor. Treatment with antibiotics in patients with proven atherosclerosis has not demonstrated a decreased risk of <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> other coronary vascular diseases.|$|R

25|$|Results of {{a medical}} study known as the Cardiac Arrhythmia Suppression Trial (CAST) {{demonstrated}} that patients with structural heart disease (such as a history of MI (<b>heart</b> <b>attack),</b> <b>or</b> left ventricular dysfunction) and also patients with ventricular arrhythmias, should not take this drug. The results were so significant that the trial was stopped early and preliminary results were published.|$|E
25|$|Smoking also {{increases}} {{the chance of}} heart disease, stroke, atherosclerosis, and peripheral vascular disease. Several ingredients of tobacco lead to the narrowing of blood vessels, increasing {{the likelihood of a}} blockage, and thus a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke. According to a study by an international team of researchers, people under 40 are five {{times more likely to have}} a heart attack if they smoke.|$|E
25|$|Floyd Jarrett, {{whose home}} {{was about a}} mile from the Farm, was arrested by police on 5 October 1985, having given false details when stopped with an {{allegedly}} false tax disc. While he was in custody, four officers attended his home to conduct a search. During the search, his mother Cynthia Jarrett collapsed and died. It has never been satisfactorily concluded how and why Cynthia Jarrett died, and whether it was a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> due to police actions.|$|E
50|$|The {{cholesterol}} reduction {{effect has}} been observed only in small studies. This, {{as well as the}} anti-clogging effect of pomegranate juice, are the result of its concentration of antioxidants, and are similar to the effects shown in studies of red wine, black tea, and purple grape juice. There have been no large clinical trials showing that antioxidants can prevent <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> other major heart-related events.|$|R
50|$|Side effects {{include a}} 37% {{increase}} in incidence of major vascular events, which include nonfatal myocardial infarction, nonfatal stroke, or death from a blood vessel-related cause. Additionally, an 81% increase in incidence of upper gastrointestinal complications occurs, which include perforations, obstructions, or gastrointestinal bleeding {{as in all}} nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs). In July 2015 the FDA strengthened the warning that non-aspirin NSAIDs can cause <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> strokes.|$|R
50|$|Saxagliptin {{is used as}} {{monotherapy}} or {{in combination}} with other drugs for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. It does not appear to decrease the risk of <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> strokes. It increases the risk of hospitalization for heart failure by about 27%. Like other DPP-4 inhibitors, it has relatively modest HbA1c lowering ability, is associated with a relatively modest risk of hypoglycemia, and does not cause weight gain.|$|R
25|$|An {{additional}} 79 million Americans have prediabetes. Individuals with prediabetes have {{blood glucose}} levels that {{are higher than}} normal but not high enough to be classified as diabetes. Without intervention, most people with prediabetes will develop diabetes within ten years. In addition, {{studies have shown that}} these individuals are at increased risk for cardiovascular disease, including a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke. Individuals with prediabetes are also likely to have additional cardiovascular risk factors such as elevated cholesterol and high blood pressure.|$|E
25|$|May 14, 1960: The {{pilot of}} a Beechcraft Bonanza private plane {{suffered}} an apparent {{heart attack and}} fell unconscious while en route from Fort Worth to Dallas. The pilot's wife and sole passenger, {{who was not a}} trained pilot, managed to guide the Bonanza to Love Field but crashed while attempting to land. Both occupants suffered severe injuries and the pilot was pronounced dead, but it is unclear whether his death resulted from the <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> from injuries sustained during the crash.|$|E
25|$|Why {{the freight}} train failed to stop was unclear. A wrong-side signal problem was eliminated, leaving human error {{as the only}} {{possible}} cause. However, since the head-end crew of the freight train did not survive, {{it was not clear}} why they had erred. Enough of their remains were found that testing was able to rule out drugs or alcohol as the cause, though it was revealed that the engineer, Jack Hudson, was an alcoholic and heavy smoker suffering from pancreatitis and type 2 diabetes, thus placing him at risk for a <b>heart</b> <b>attack</b> <b>or</b> stroke.|$|E
5000|$|Fish oil {{supplement}} {{studies have}} failed to support claims of preventing <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> strokes. Earlier, in 2007, the American Heart Association had recommended the consumption of 1 gram of fish oil daily, preferably by eating fish, for patients with coronary artery disease, but cautioned pregnant and nursing women to avoid eating fish with high potential for mercury contaminants including mackerel, shark, and swordfish. (Optimal dosage was related to body weight.) ...|$|R
5000|$|When {{the drug}} was {{approved}} in July 2015, the announced price was higher than analysts had predicted: $14,600 a year. [...] Pharmacy benefit managers continued expressing their concerns, as did insurance companies and some doctors, who were especially concerned over the price, {{in light of the}} fact that the FDA approval was based on lowering cholesterol alone, and not on better health outcomes, such as fewer <b>heart</b> <b>attacks</b> <b>or</b> longer life.|$|R
5000|$|As of 2016 pertuzumab had {{not been}} studied in people with a left {{ventricular}} ejection fraction value of ≤ 50% normal, a prior history of congestive heart failure, or conditions that could impair left ventricular function like uncontrolled hypertension, recent <b>heart</b> <b>attacks,</b> <b>or</b> serious cardiac arrhythmia. [...] Caution should be used combining pertuzumab with an anthracycline. [...] There is also no safety data available for use of pertuzumab in combination with doxorubicin.|$|R
