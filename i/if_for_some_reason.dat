25|$|Win by forfeit: A wrestler {{also may}} gain a victory by forfeit {{when the other}} wrestler for some reason fails to appear for the match. In a tournament, the wrestler could also win by a medical forfeit <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> his {{opponent}} becomes ill or injured {{during the course of}} the tournament and decides not to continue wrestling. For a wrestler to win by forfeit or medical forfeit however, he must appear on the mat in a wrestling uniform. The existence of the forfeit condition encourages teams to have at least one varsity (and one junior varsity) competitor at every weight class. The wrestler who declared the medical forfeit is excused from further weigh-ins but is eliminated from further competition.|$|E
25|$|During season two, a {{panel of}} four celebrity judges was used to shrink the field of 40 semifinalists to ten finalists. The celebrity judges rated each of the semifinalists as they performed, and cast votes for the 10 top comedians. When the ten finalists were {{announced}} they {{did not seem to}} correspond with the judges' votes, which the judges noticed. Two celebrity judges, comedians Drew Carey and Brett Butler, left the judges' table visibly angry after the finalists were announced. The two were shown backstage arguing with producers. Carey and Butler did not understand how the finalists who were announced could have advanced, given the way the judges had voted. It was revealed that {{a panel of}} four producers were also casting votes in the process, assuring that unless all four celebrity judges cast exactly the same ten votes, their voting power could be usurped by the four unanimously agreeing producers. <b>If</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> all four celebrity judges did cast exactly the same votes, the worst the producers would be faced with was a tie.|$|E

2500|$|A scrum {{is formed}} as near {{to where the}} {{infringement}} or stoppage occurred and at least five metres from either goal line. A normal scrum contains eight players from each team. <b>If</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> a team is reduced below fifteen men the scrum numbers can also be reduced, although there can never be fewer than five. The hookers binds with their props, the locks bind each other and their front row, {{with all the other}} players in the scrum binding to the locks. The referee makes a mark where the scrum is to be formed and waits for both teams to bind together. The referee then calls [...] "crouch" [...] (both front rows must crouch down) [...] "touch" [...] (the props touch each other's shoulders) [...] "pause" [...] and then [...] "engage". However, a shortened sequence is currently being trialed in which the referee calls [...] "crouch" [...] (both front rows must crouch down) [...] "Bind" [...] (the props secure binds on each other's shoulders) and then [...] "Set" [...] at which point both packs rows engage. When engage (or set) is called the two front rows can come together and everyone in the scrum must stay bound until it is completed. Once the referee is happy with the engagement the scrum-half from the team awarded the fee throws the ball into the tunnel (gap) between the two front-rows.|$|E
2500|$|Recordset: A {{recordset}} is a {{group of}} records, and can either come from a base table or {{as the result of a}} query to the table. The RecordSet object contains a Fields collection and a Properties collection. The Fields collection is a set of Field objects, which are the corresponding columns in the table. The Properties collection is a set of Property objects, which defines a particular functionality of an OLE DB provider. The RecordSet has numerous methods and properties for examining the data that exists within it. Records can be updated in the recordset by changing the values in the record and then calling on the Update or UpdateBatch method. Adding new records is performed through the AddNew function and then by calling on the Update or UpdateBatch method. Records are also deleted in the recordset with the Delete method and then by calling on the Update method. However, <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> the deletion cannot occur, such as because of violations in referential integrity, then the recordset will remain in edit mode after the call to the Update method. The programmer must explicitly call on the CancelUpdate function to cancel the update. Additionally, ADO can roll back transactions (if this is supported) and cancel batch updates. Recordsets can also be updated in one of three ways: via an immediate update, via a batch update, or through the use of transactions: ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{gauge theory}} {{is a type}} of theory in physics. The word gauge means a measurement, a thickness, an {{in-between}} distance, (as in railroad tracks) or a resulting number of units per certain parameter (a number of loops in an inch of fabric or a number of lead balls in a pound of ammunition.) Modern theories describe physical forces in terms of fields, e.g., the electromagnetic field, the gravitational field, and fields that describe forces between the elementary particles. A general feature of these field theories is that the fundamental fields cannot be directly measured; however, some associated quantities can be measured, such as charges, energies, and velocities. For example, as <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reason</b> you can not measure the diameter of lead balls but you can obtain an information of how many of them fit into a pound. In field theories, different configurations of the unobservable fields can result in identical observable quantities. A transformation from one such field configuration to another is called a gauge transformation; the lack of change in the measurable quantities, despite the field being transformed, is a property called gauge invariance. For example, if you could measure the color of lead balls and discover that when you change the color, you still fit the same number of balls in a pound, the property of [...] "color" [...] would show gauge invariance. Since any kind of invariance under a field transformation is considered a symmetry, gauge invariance is sometimes called gauge symmetry. Generally, any theory that has the property of gauge invariance is considered a gauge theory.|$|E

Even if functional relations between these two frames are usually limited, they influence each other during the interaction between long- and short-term memory processes in spatial cognition. <b>If,</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reasons,</b> this process is impaired, the egocentric sensory inputs are no more able to update {{the contents of the}} allocentric representation of the body: the subject is locked to it. |$|R

The risk is exacerbated <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> (in fact, the reasons are countless) a patient is not eligible for a substantial portion of insurance package that he/she is entitled to, in principle, ~ 70  %.

This implies a more proactive coordination between hospitals and health insurance authorities in alleviating the obstacles to eligible rights of the patients.|$|R

30|$|Another common {{practice}} among researchers {{to investigate the}} individual-level link has been the use of crime self-reports (see, for example, Junger-Tas and Marshall 1999). It is interesting that, as opposed to official records, researchers generally find that immigrants are more law abiding than natives (see, for example, Junger-Tas 1997; Butcher and Piehl 1998). However, underreporting of responses {{is a major concern}} in these studies, since questions try to elicit information on a very sensitive part of personal behaviour. Therefore, <b>if</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>reasons</b> immigrants tend to underreport by more than natives, the estimated differences reported by the studies above reflect to some extent differences in reporting behaviour rather than differences in criminal activity. To the best of my knowledge, no study using crime self-reports has attempted to somehow correct for possible underreporting.|$|R

Then 2/3 will means that you will inject 1 unit of Humalog or Novorapid/Novolog for each 12 grams of carbohydrates, and 1 unit for every 3 ounces of protein food.|$|R
