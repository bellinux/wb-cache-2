5|$|The Phasianidae are {{a family}} of {{terrestrial}} birds which consists of quails, partridges, snowcocks, francolins, spurfowls, tragopans, monals, pheasants, peafowls and jungle <b>fowls.</b> In general, they are plump (although they vary in size) and have broad, relatively short wings.|$|E
5|$|Pet {{birds are}} kept in their millions, as are {{domestic}} <b>fowls,</b> bantams, and pigeons. These last had an important effect on evolutionary biology, as Charles Darwin took an especial interest in pigeon fancying, adopted the hobby himself, and made use of the wide variation between breeds as an argument for the power of selection in his 1859 Origin of Species.|$|E

5|$|Fruit {{and young}} {{vegetables}} are {{popular in the}} cuisine from the Rhône valley. Poultry from Bresse, guinea <b>fowls</b> from Drôme and fish from the Dombes lakes and mountain in Rhône-Alpes streams are key to the cuisine as well. Lyon and Savoy supply high quality sausages while the Alpine regions supply their specialty cheeses like Beaufort, Abondance, Reblochon, Tomme and Vacherin. Mères lyonnaises are {{a particular type of}} restaurateur relegated to this region that are the regions bistro. Celebrated chefs from this region include Fernand Point, Paul Bocuse, the Troisgros brothers and Alain Chapel. The Chartreuse Mountains are in this region, and the liquor Chartreuse is produced by the Grande Chartreuse monks.|$|E
5|$|Other than feral {{dogs and}} {{domestic}} cattle, {{the most frequently}} encountered non-human mammal is the hanuman, a long tailed grey langur prevalent in the Gangetic plain. Some wild boars and wolves may still be spotted in the small forests of Chinpai, Bandarsol and Charicha. Leopards and bears {{are not to be}} seen any more in the wild. Sometimes during the season when mahua trees bloom, wild Asiatic elephants from Jharkhand come in trampling crops and threatening life and property. Birds of Birbhum include a mix of hilly and plain-land dwelling species like partridge, pigeon, green pigeon, water <b>fowls,</b> doyel, Indian robin, drongo, hawk, cuckoo, koel, sunbird, Indian roller, parrot, babbler, and some migratory birds.|$|E
5|$|The British {{blockade}} {{continued to}} prevent French efforts to resupply Valletta {{during the early}} summer of 1800, and by August the situation was desperate: no horses or pack animals, dogs, cats, <b>fowls</b> or rabbits still lived within the city, the cisterns had been emptied and even firewood was in short supply. So desperate was the need for wood that the frigate Boudeuse, trapped by the blockade, was broken up for fuel by the beleaguered garrison. With defeat now inevitable, Vaubois gave orders that the frigates Diane and Justice were to attempt a breakout for Toulon, the frigates given minimal crews of approximately 115 men each. On 24 August, when the wind was favourable and the night dark enough to obscure their movements, the frigates put to sea. Almost immediately, lookouts on HMS Success sighted them and Captain Peard gave chase, followed by HMS Genereux and Northumberland. Diane under Captain Solen was too slow and Peard soon overhauled the under strength French ship, which surrendered after a brief exchange of shot. The frigate later became HMS Niobe. Justice, under Captain Jean Villeneuve, was faster however and outran its pursuers, eventually making Toulon, the only ship from Malta to do so during the siege.|$|E

5|$|Below Frodsham, barges {{carrying}} salt had {{to negotiate}} a tidal section of the river to reach the Mersey, from where the cargo would be taken to Liverpool or Manchester for distribution worldwide. Water levels were inadequate for the Mersey Flats at neap tides, resulting in them having to wait for days at Frodsham. In 1796, users of the navigation suggested {{that it should be}} extended to Weston Point, where the water was deeper. The trustees wanted to pay for this extension by raising tolls, but the users objected, and it took several years to work out a deal which suited both parties. Finally, the Trustees obtained a third Act on 8 August 1807, which authorised the construction of a cut from Frodsham to Weston Point. The trustees insisted that their own engineer, John Johnson, should oversee the work, but the project was too large for him, and ran over time and budget. He was sacked in 1809, after serving the navigation for 29 years, and Thomas Telford was asked to complete the work. He managed the project with Samuel <b>Fowls</b> as engineer. At Weston Point, a new lock connected the cut to a basin, and tide gates connect the basin to the Mersey. This cut was called the Weston Canal and was completed in 1810. A fourth Act was obtained on 2 May 1825, which altered some of the details of the previous Act, and an Act of 22 May 1829 noted that the Weston Canal had been completed. It stated that the Trustees had built a basin, piers and a lighthouse at Weston Point, that the Weston Canal was officially a branch of the River Weaver, and that the Trustees would make no additional charges for using the section. No tolls had been collected since 1816, once the construction costs had been repaid.|$|E
5|$|The siege at the Peñol de Cerquín {{dragged on}} for months, with {{constant}} fighting. The Spanish there numbered about a hundred, plus auxiliaries, but were unable to maintain supply lines through the surrounding hostile territory, and were often short of food. The seasonal rains that arrived in spring 1538 only added to their hardship. The supplies from El Salvador finally arrived, and Cáceres slowly gained territory around the Peñol. After six months, Cáceres invited Lempira to a parley. Lempira arrived, dressed in full regalia, cotton armour, and plumed headdress, accompanied by a retinue of nobles. Cáceres sent a mounted soldier to request his surrender, and when Lempira refused, a carefully hidden arquebusier shot him through the head. This was a signal for an all-out surprise attack by the Spanish. The Indians responded with complete panic at {{the death of their}} leader, and the Spanish onslaught swiftly took the fortress without any Spanish loss of life, although some were wounded. A portion of the indigenous garrison retreated to nearby mountains, but most of the Indians surrendered without further resistance, including a great many women, children and elderly. Cáceres followed Montejo's instructions in dealing with the defeated natives with moderation. He followed native custom and sent gifts of textiles and <b>fowls</b> to the native leaders, as a symbol of peace, accompanied by a spear as a promise of war should they refuse to submit. After a council, the Indian leaders accepted peace, and the region passed immediately under Spanish control. Cáceres released all his prisoners to return to their villages, a move that surprised the natives, who had expected harsh punitive measures. The fall of Lempira's stronghold was followed by the speedy capitulation of a wide area of Honduras, and came at a critical juncture for the Spanish, when they had been at the point of losing the province.|$|E

25|$|Similar to the {{physiological}} regeneration of hair in mammals, birds can regenerate their feathers {{in order to}} repair damaged feathers or to attract mates with their plumage.

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{determine}} the antigenic differences among <b>fowl,</b> pigeon, and canary pox viruses. Also to, determine the cross protection potentials of these viruses and to select one of these viruses' isolates as live vaccine candidates against <b>fowl</b> pox. There was no death following challenge of experimental birds by canary pox virus (CPV). Where as, there was death of some birds followed challenge of experimental birds by <b>fowl</b> (FPV) pox virus and pigeon pox virus (PPV). This result showed that canary pox virus isthe safest of the three viruses for vaccination as a live vaccine. <b>Fowl,</b> pigeon and canary pox antigens were prepared by inoculating 0. 1 ml of 10 - 3 diluted isolates via chorioallantoic membrane of 11 - 12 day old embryonated chicken’s eggs. Inoculation of the CAM by the three viruses showed clear distinguishable pock lesions for each virus. Sera were obtained from experimental chickens. Examination of <b>fowl,</b> pigeon and canary pox antisera against <b>fowl</b> pox, pigeon pox and canary pox antigens respectively by AGPT test showed clear precipitin lines. Examination of <b>fowl,</b> pigeon and canary pox antisera against <b>fowl</b> pox, pigeon pox and canary pox antigens respectively by Passive haemagglutination (PHA) gave positive results. These result indicated that there is serological and antigenic relationship between the three viruses. V Titration of 0. 1 ml of each isolate of the 3 -viruses in embryonated chicken eggs showed that the EID 50 of <b>fowl</b> and pigeonspox viruses' were 10 9. 3 and that of canary pox virus was 10 10. 5. When pigeons were infected by <b>fowl</b> and canary pox viruses no lesions appeared. Also when canaries were infected by <b>fowl</b> and pigeon pox viruses no lesions appeared. But when Chicken were infected by canary, pigeon and <b>fowl</b> pox viruses lesions appeared. Thatmeans chickens are susceptible to both canary and pigeon viruses, so there is pathogenic relationship between chicken, pigeon and canary pox viruses, where as pigeons are resistant to <b>fowl</b> and canary pox viruses, which means thatthere is no pathogenic relationship between pigeons and canary and <b>fowl</b> pox viruses; also canary birds are resistant to <b>fowl</b> and pigeon pox viruses, which means there is no pathogenic relationship between pigeon and <b>fowl</b> pox viruses...|$|R
