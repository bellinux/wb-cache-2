40|$|Contained {{within this}} paper is a summary {{description}} {{of the state of}} the art in <b>flexible</b> pavement <b>design</b> along with a look to the future in terms of some specific technical needs, the translation of the new technology into practice, and making <b>flexible</b> pavement <b>design</b> (or pavement engineering in general) a more credible discipline. Since the scope of the Committee on <b>Flexible</b> Pavement <b>Design</b> focuses upon the improvement of <b>flexible</b> pavement <b>design</b> (with particular emphasis on closing the gap between the state of the art and the state of the practice), these are issues that can be well addressed at this time. OVERVIEW Keeping in mind that <b>flexible</b> pavement <b>design</b> deals primarily with structural aspects (i. e., the selection of appropriate materials, characterization of strength or load-carrying properties, layer thickness determination), it can be said that the state of the art in <b>flexible</b> pavement <b>design</b> is manifested in mechanistic, or mechanistic-empirical (M-E), based design procedures that incorporate the treatment of life-cycle costs and design reliability. State-ofthe-practice methods, on the other hand, tend to rely more on empirical correlations with past performance, index-value-based characterizations of material properties [laye...|$|R
25|$|The <b>flexible</b> <b>design</b> of the vehicle, {{its high}} speed, {{maneuverability}} and long range, on road and off-road, {{makes it possible}} to produce various versions to satisfy various military and security purposes. Variants include the Fahd 240/280 APC, Fahd 280-30 IFV, a command post vehicle, ambulance vehicle, light armored recovery vehicle, and can be used for anti-riot purposes, mine laying and mine dispensing purposes, making it possible to form independent units capable of dealing with different threats of armor, low-flying targets, and personnel, with common repair duties, and operation. The Fahd consists of a Mercedes-Benz LAP 1117/32 truck (4 × 4) chassis fitted with an armored body. It has a usual APC configuration of placing the driver and the commander on the front, and a large box-like shape, similar to the German Fuchs.|$|E

500|$|The unsuitability of unarmored iron for warship hulls {{meant that}} iron was only adopted as a {{building}} material for battleships when protected by armor. However, iron gave the naval architect many advantages. Iron allowed larger ships and more <b>flexible</b> <b>design,</b> for instance {{the use of}} watertight bulkheads on the lower decks. Warrior, built of iron, was longer and faster than the wooden-hulled Gloire. [...] Iron could be produced to order and used immediately, {{in contrast to the}} need to give wood a long period of seasoning. And, given the large quantities of wood required to build a steam warship and the falling cost of iron, iron hulls were increasingly cost-effective. The main reason for the French use of wooden hulls for the ironclad fleet built in the 1860s was that the French iron industry could not supply enough, and the main reason why Britain built its handful of wooden-hulled ironclads was to make best use of hulls already started and wood already bought.|$|E
50|$|When {{weighting}} {{the relative}} importance of flexibility versus usability, designers are advised to consider how well the needs of the user are understood.

40|$|Problem outline: It {{is common}} to {{classify}} empirical research designs as either qualitative or quantitative. Typically, particular research methods (e. g., case studies, action research, experiments and surveys) are associated with {{one or the other}} of these types of design. Studies in empirical software engineering (ESE) are often exploratory and often involve software developers and development organizations. As a consequence, it may be difficult to plan all aspects of the studies, and to be successful, ESE studies must often be designed to handle possible changes during the conduct of the study. A problem with the above classification is that it does not cater for flexibility in design. Position: This paper suggests viewing research in ESE along the axis of <b>flexible</b> and fixed <b>designs,</b> which is both orthogonal to the axis of quantitative and qualitative designs, and independent of the particular research method. According to the traditional view of ESE, changes to the research design in the course of a study are typically regarded as threats to the validity of the results. However, viewing the study <b>designs</b> as <b>flexible,</b> practical challenges can provide useful information. The validity of the results of studies with <b>flexible</b> research <b>designs</b> can be established by applying techniques that are traditionally used for qualitative designs. This paper urges an increased recognition of <b>flexible</b> <b>designs</b> in ESE and discusses techniques for establishing the trustworthiness in <b>flexible</b> <b>designs...</b>|$|R

5000|$|Sometimes a {{distinction}} is made between [...] "fixed" [...] and [...] "flexible" [...] designs. In some cases, these types coincide with {{quantitative and qualitative}} research designs respectively, though this need not be the case. In fixed designs, {{the design of the}} study is fixed before the main stage of data collection takes place. Fixed designs are normally theory-driven; otherwise, {{it is impossible to know}} in advance which variables need to be controlled and measured. Often, these variables are measured quantitatively. <b>Flexible</b> <b>designs</b> allow for more freedom during the data collection process. One reason for using a <b>flexible</b> research <b>design</b> can be that the variable of interest is not quantitatively measurable, such as culture.

When designing building structures, one must take into account the mutual interrelations between various systems and the readiness for changes during the lifecycle of building structures. The issue of flexibility is presented using the example of a buffer parking lot which was analyzed with regards to its economic efficiency, using a hybrid method and, simultaneously, the NPV method and a simulation. Traditional designing processes have certain shortcomings as they are most often based on one value, identified using deterministic methods, while <b>flexible</b> approach to <b>design</b> enables adopting infrastructure to the changing conditions occurring during its lifecycle...|$|R
