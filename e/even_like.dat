For example, the characters of Goneril and Regan, the comparison of which he begins with a note of personal distaste ("they are so thoroughly hateful that we do not <b>even</b> <b>like</b> to repeat their names"), are shown, he points out, partly in their reaction to their sister Cordelia's desire that they treat their father well—Prescribe not to us our duties—and partly by the contrast of their hypocrisy with the candor of the otherwise evil Edmund.|$|E

5|$|Overall, {{woodpeckers}} are arboreal {{birds of}} wooded habitats. They reach their greatest diversity in tropical rainforests, but occur {{in almost all}} suitable habitats including woodlands, savannahs, scrublands, and bamboo forests. Even grasslands and deserts have been colonised by various species. These habitats are more easily occupied where {{a small number of}} trees exist, or, in the case of desert species like the Gila woodpecker, tall cacti are available for nesting. Some are specialists and are associated with coniferous or deciduous woodland or <b>even,</b> <b>like</b> the acorn woodpecker, with individual tree genera (oaks in this case). Other species are generalists and are able to adapt to forest clearance by exploiting secondary growth, plantations, orchards and parks. In general, forest-dwelling species need rotting or dead wood on which to forage.|$|E

Media Molecule were {{aware of the fact that}} Sony wanted them to demonstrate the game at the upcoming GDC 2007, but they were not told they were to be part of Phil Harrison's keynote speech until near the date it was due to take place. Healey stated that it was only when they arrived in San Francisco for the conference that they realised just how much backing Sony were devoting to the game—much more than Media Molecule had previously thought. Healey relates that although the revelation of Sony's faith in the game boosted their confidence, additionally, it increased the pressure on them with the realisation that their task had become much greater than originally anticipated.|$|E

Metcalfe explained that when Mercedes woke up, she was in disbelief about the events of the previous night and felt [...] "appalled". She added that Mercedes did not fancy Tony and that they did not <b>even</b> <b>like</b> each other, which was why [...] "neither of them can understand what happened between them". Regarding Mercedes' feelings about hurting Jacqui, Metcalfe stated: [...] "Mercedes hates herself for it. She feels incredibly guilty and ashamed of what she's done.

It progresses into a cryptic and bleak spoken verse from Drummond: [...] "Here we come, crawling {{out of the}} mud, from chaos primeval to the burned out sun, dragging our bad selves {{from one end of}} time, with nothing to declare but some half-written rhymes". A cacophone of further samples from The Monkees' theme and Drummond's voice follow – [...] "We're not The Monkees, I don't <b>even</b> <b>like</b> The Monkees!"

[...] Despite the perception of sport by her father, she played when young football with her three brothers, though her father did not approve: [...] "My father was very old-fashioned, and he didn't like soccer. He didn't <b>even</b> <b>like</b> that my brothers played soccer. When he went to work, I would sneak out of the house to go and practice in the street." [...] Domínguez did not find a girls' team to play on until she was a teenager. Domínguez fooled the boys in the neighborhood she grew up in into playing with her by keeping her hair short like a boy. They called her Mario and only found out that she was a girl when her picture appeared in the newspaper after she made it on the sub-national women's team.|$|E

To Baxter, he wrote, [...] "I am anxious that she should be brought up...like a philosopher, <b>even</b> <b>like</b> a cynic." [...] Scholars have speculated that she may have been sent away for her health, to remove her from the seamy side of business, or to {{introduce}} her to radical politics. Mary Godwin revelled in the spacious surroundings of Baxter's house and in the companionship of his four daughters, and she returned north in the summer of 1813 for a further stay of 10 months. In the 1831 introduction to Frankenstein, she recalled: [...] "I wrote then—but in a most common-place style. It was beneath the trees of the grounds belonging to our house, or on the bleak sides of the woodless mountains near, that my true compositions, the airy flights of my imagination, were born and fostered." ...|$|E

[...] "I feel it goes perfect {{for that kind of}} look", she commented. For Cyrus, The Time of Our Lives was a transitional EP and a method of re-introducing herself to new audiences. Speaking about the EP's sound, she said, [...] "I kind of kept it in the lines of what I usually do, which is kind of a pop rock sound — I don’t <b>even</b> <b>like</b> using the word 'rock,' because I feel like it’s an honor to be put in that title. This is kind of my transition. The next record, I definitely {{want to be able to}} step it up a bit." [...] Cyrus originally planned for her succeeding album to be edgier and more predominant in rock music. She said that, after completing promotion for The Time of Our Lives, she wanted to [...] "step out and maybe take a break" [...] for some time in order to compose music that inspires her. Cyrus' next album, Can't Be Tamed was released approximately ten months later, on June 18, 2010.|$|E

500|$|The Cure {{released}} {{their debut}} album Three Imaginary Boys in May 1979. Because of the band's inexperience in the studio, Parry and engineer Mike Hedges {{took control of}} the recording. The band, particularly Smith, were unhappy with the album; in a 1987 interview, he admitted, [...] "a lot of it was very superficial – I didn't <b>even</b> <b>like</b> it at the time. There were criticisms made that it was very lightweight, and I thought they were justified. Even when we'd made it, I wanted to do something that I thought had more substance to it". The band's second single, [...] "Boys Don't Cry", was released in June. The Cure then embarked as the support band for Siouxsie and the Banshees' Join Hands promotional tour of England, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales between August and October. The tour saw Smith pull double duty each night by performing with the Cure and as the guitarist with the Banshees when John McKay quit the group in Aberdeen. That musical experience had a strong impact on him: [...] "On stage that first night with the Banshees, I was blown away by how powerful I felt playing that kind of music. It was so different to what we were doing with the Cure. Before that, I'd wanted us to be like the Buzzcocks or Elvis Costello; the punk Beatles. Being a Banshee really changed my attitude to what I was doing." ...|$|E
500|$|Bolt's record-setting runs caused {{commentators}} {{not only}} to praise his achievements but also to speculate about his potential {{to become one of}} the most successful sprinters ever. Critics hailed his Olympic success as a new beginning for a sport that had long suffered through high-profile drug scandals. The previous six years had seen the BALCO scandal, Tim Montgomery and Justin Gatlin stripped of their 100 m world records, and Marion Jones returning three Olympic gold medals. All three sprinters were disqualified from athletics after drugs tests detected banned substances in their systems. Bolt's record-breaking performances caused suspicion among some commentators, including Victor Conte, and the lack of an independent Caribbean anti-doping federation raised more concerns. The accusations of drug use were vehemently rejected by Glen Mills (Bolt's coach) and Herb Elliott (the Jamaican athletics team doctor). Elliott, a member of the IAAF anti-doping commission, urged those concerned about the issue to [...] "come down and see our programme, come down and see our testing, we have nothing to hide". Mills had been equally ardent that Bolt was a clean athlete, declaring to the Jamaica Gleaner: [...] "We will test any time, any day, any part of the body... doesn't <b>even</b> <b>like</b> to take vitamins". Bolt stated that he had been tested four times prior to the Olympics, and all had tested negative for banned substances. He also welcomed anti-doping authorities to test him to prove that he was clean, stating, [...] "We work hard and we perform well and we know we're clean".|$|E

500|$|As Bacon's work {{moved from}} the extreme subject matter of his early {{paintings}} to portraits of friends in the mid-1960s, Dyer became a dominating presence in the artist's work. Bacon's treatment of his lover in these canvasses emphasises his subject's physicality while remaining uncharacteristically tender. More than any other of the artist's close friends portrayed during this period, Dyer came to feel inseparable from his effigies. The paintings gave him stature, a raison d'être, and offered meaning to what Bacon described as Dyer's [...] "brief interlude between life and death". Many critics have cited Dyer's portraits as favourites, including Michel Leiris and Lawrence Gowling. Yet as Dyer's novelty diminished within Bacon's circle of sophisticated intellectuals, the younger man became increasingly bitter and ill at ease. Although Dyer welcomed the attention the paintings brought him, he did not pretend to understand or <b>even</b> <b>like</b> them. [...] "All that money an' I fink they're reely 'orrible", he observed with choked pride. He abandoned crime but soon descended into alcoholism. Bacon's money allowed Dyer to attract hangers-on who would accompany him on massive benders around London's Soho. Withdrawn and reserved when sober, Dyer was insuppressible when drunk, and would often attempt to [...] "pull a Bacon" [...] by buying large rounds and paying for expensive dinners for his wide circle. Dyer's erratic behaviour inevitably wore thin—with his cronies, with Bacon, and with Bacon's friends. Most of Bacon's art world associates regarded Dyer as a nuisance—an intrusion {{into the world of}} high culture to which their Bacon belonged. Dyer reacted by becoming increasingly needy and dependent. By 1971, he was drinking alone and was only in occasional contact with his former lover.|$|E
500|$|Shortly {{after the}} release of The Incredible Hulk, Gale Anne Hurd commented on the {{uncertainty}} of its relationship with Ang Lee's Hulk film. [...] "We couldn't quite figure out how to term this ... It's kind of a reboot and it's kind of sequel." [...] Hurd said that [...] "requel", a portmanteau of [...] "reboot" [...] and [...] "sequel", was a [...] "perfect" [...] description for the film. Norton explained his decision to ignore Lee's origin story: [...] "I don't <b>even</b> <b>like</b> the phrase 'origin story', and I don't think in great literature and great films that explaining the roots of the story doesn't mean it comes in the beginning." [...] "Audiences know this story," [...] he added, [...] " [...] deal with it artfully." [...] He wanted to [...] "have revelations even in the third act about what set this whole thing in motion". The new origin story references Ultimate Marvel's take on the Hulk, which also had him created in an attempt to make super soldiers. Norton removed Rick Jones and toned down S.H.I.E.L.D.'s presence. He also added the scene where Banner attempts to extract a cure from a flower and his e-mailing with Samuel Sterns, which references Bruce Jones' story. Norton rewrote scenes every day. Ultimately, the Writers Guild of America decided to credit the script solely to Penn, who argued Norton had not dramatically changed his script. Journalist Anne Thompson explained [...] "The Guild tends to favor plot, structure and pre-existing characters over dialogue." [...] Penn said in 2008, [...] "I wasn't happy with [...] coming to Comic-Con saying that he wrote the script." [...] Before either Penn and Norton joined the project, an anonymous screenwriter wrote a draft and lobbied for credit.|$|E
