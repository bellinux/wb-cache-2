It is this monomeric form that displays the typical staggered metallocene sandwich structure. At room temperature (25°C), the lifetime of the monomeric form in acetonitrile is less than two seconds; and rhodocene forms 2, a diamagnetic 18-valence electron bridged dimeric ansa-metallocene structure. Electron spin resonance (ESR), nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and infrared spectroscopic (IR) measurements point {{to the presence of}} an equilibrium interconverting the monomeric and dimeric forms. ESR evidence confirms that the monomer possesses a <b>high</b> <b>order</b> axis of symmetry (Cn, n>2) with a mirror plane (σ) perpendicular to it as symmetry elements; this experimentally demonstrates that the monomer does possess the typical sandwich structure of a metallocene although the interpretation of the ESR data has been questioned. The decomposition pathway of the monomer has also been studied by mass spectrometry. The dimerisation is a redox process; the dimer is a rhodium(I) species and the monomer has a rhodium(II) centre. Rhodium typically occupies oxidation states +I or +III in its stable compounds.|$|E

A simpler {{form of the}} Hong-Mandel <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> squeezing criterion is derived under this framework by using an operator ordering theorem introduced by us in [J. Phys.

Similarly, condition for <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> subpoissonian photon statistics is derived by normal <b>ordering</b> of <b>higher</b> powers of number operator. Further, {{with the help of}} simple density matrices, it is shown that the <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> antibunching (HOA) and <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> subpoissonian photon statistics (HOSPS) are not the manifestation of the same phenomenon and consequently it is incorrect to use the condition of HOA as a test of HOSPS. It is also shown that the HOA and HOSPS may exist even in absence of the corresponding lower order phenomenon.

40|$|Mutation {{testing is}} a fault-based {{software}} testing technique {{that has been}} studied widely for over three decades. To date, work in this field has focused largely on first order mutants because {{it is believed that}} <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> mutation testing is too computationally expensive to be practical. This thesis argues that some <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> mutants are potentially better able to simulate real world faults and to reveal insights into programming bugs than the restricted class of first order mutants. This thesis proposes a <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> mutation testing paradigm which combines valuable <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> mutants and non-trivial first order mutants together for mutation testing. To overcome the exponential {{increase in the number of}} <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> mutants a search process that seeks fit mutants (both first and <b>higher</b> <b>order)</b> from the space of all possible mutants is proposed. A fault-based <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> mutant classification scheme is introduced. Based on different types of fault interactions, this approach classifies <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> mutants into four categories: expected, worsening, fault masking and fault shifting. A search-based approach is then proposed for locating subsuming and strongly subsuming <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> mutants. These mutants are a subset of fault mask and fault shift classes of <b>higher</b> <b>order</b> mutants that are more difficult to kill than their constituent first order mutants.
