The 5038s are essentially midrange drivers that start rolling off at 15kHz. In 1960, after feedback from foreign distributors, the Paragon {{was made into a}} 3-way loudspeaker by adding two 075 ring radiators (tweeters) mounted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the cabinet and aimed at the central 'sweet spot'. Bass–mid crossover was at 500Hz and mid–treble frequencies crossed over at 7kHz.|$|E

5|$|A Czech woman went to Heydrich's aid and flagged down a {{delivery}} van. He was first {{placed in the}} driver's cab, but complained the van's movement was causing him pain. He was placed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the van, on his stomach, and taken {{to the emergency room}} at Bulovka Hospital. He had suffered severe injuries to his left side, with major damage to his diaphragm, spleen, and one of his lungs. He also had a fractured rib. A doctor, Slanina, packed the chest wound, while another doctor, Walter Diek, tried unsuccessfully to remove the splinters. He immediately decided to operate. This was carried out by Diek, Slanina, and Hohlbaum. Heydrich was given several blood transfusions. A splenectomy was performed. The chest wound, left lung, and diaphragm were all debrided and the wounds closed.|$|E
5|$|After being marched {{two miles}} north-west {{of the city}} centre, the victims {{encountered}} a barbed wire barrier and numerous Ukrainian police and German troops. Thirty or forty people at a time were told to leave their possessions and were escorted through a narrow passageway lined with soldiers brandishing clubs. Anyone who tried to escape was beaten. Soon the victims reached an open area, where {{they were forced to}} strip, and then were herded down into the ravine. People were forced to lie down in rows on top of the bodies of other victims, and they were shot <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the head or the neck by members of the execution squads.|$|E

5|$|Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea) {{is seated}} in a chair in Assistant Director Walter Skinner's office, where he is shown a video from the morgue. Skinner tells him that Miles is somehow alive and still out to get Scully and her unborn child. Suddenly, Agent Gene Crane comes to Doggett and tells him {{that there is a}} person—Knowle Rohrer—who wants to see him, about issues {{concerning}} Miles and Scully. This leaves Fox Mulder and Skinner to interrogate Krycek. Rohrer fabricates a story to Doggett that Miles is part of a Military Project to create a super soldier and that Scully had a chip put <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> her neck during her abduction to make her pregnant with the first organic version of a super soldier.|$|E
5|$|Another Tyrannosaurus, nicknamed Stan, {{in honor}} of amateur {{paleontologist}} Stan Sacrison, {{was found in the}} Hell Creek Formation near Buffalo, South Dakota, in the spring of 1987. It was not collected until 1992, as it was mistakenly thought to be a Triceratops skeleton. Stan is 63% complete and is on display in the Black Hills Institute of Geological Research in Hill City, South Dakota, after an extensive world tour during 1995 and 1996. This tyrannosaur, too, was found to have many bone pathologies, including broken and healed ribs, a broken (and healed) neck and a spectacular hole <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> its head, {{about the size of a}} Tyrannosaurus tooth.|$|E
5|$|Another {{transitional}} {{feature of}} Dimetrodon is a ridge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>back</b> <b>of</b> the jaw called the reflected lamina. The reflected lamina is {{found on the}} articular bone, which connects to the quadrate bone of the skull to form the jaw joint. In later mammal ancestors, the articular and quadrate separated from the jaw joint while the articular developed into the malleus bone of the middle ear. The reflected lamina became part of a ring called the tympanic annulus that supports the ear drum in all living mammals.|$|E
