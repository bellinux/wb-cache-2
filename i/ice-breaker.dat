500|$|After {{being removed}} from front-line service in 1872, {{she was used}} as a {{training}} vessel for naval engineers. The ship was decommissioned in 1875 and placed in reserve. Her ram bow allowed her to be used as an <b>ice-breaker</b> in Kiel in the 1880s. In 1882, she {{was used as a}} tender for the cadet training vessel [...] The ship was rebuilt in 1888; during the refit the propulsion system was overhauled and replaced with German-built equipment and two searchlights were installed. The ship was ultimately stricken from the naval register on 2 March 1901 and sold to shipbreakers for 72,000gold marks. Arminius was broken up for scrap the following year.|$|E
500|$|The three {{sections}} {{of a typical}} session are the warm-up, the action, and the sharing. [...] During the warm-up, the actors are encouraged {{to enter into a}} state of mind where they can be present in and aware of the current moment and are free to be creative. [...] This is done through the use of different <b>ice-breaker</b> games and activities. [...] Next, the action section of the psychodrama session is the time in which the actual scenes themselves take place. [...] Finally, in the post-discussion, the different actors are able to comment on the action, coming from their personal point of view, not as a critique, [...] sharing their empathy and experiences with the protagonist of the scene.|$|E

E9 next day [...] "proceeded as requisite" [...] {{through a series of}} snowstorms and recurring deposits of ice on the bridge till she got in touch with her friend the ice-breaker; and in her company ploughed and rooted her way back to the work we know. There is nothing to show that it was a near thing for E9, but somehow one has the idea that the <b>ice-breaker</b> did not arrive any too soon for E9's comfort and progress. (But what happens in the Baltic when the <b>ice-breaker</b> does not arrive?) ...|$|E
6000|$|Let us take, {{almost at}} random, an {{episode in the}} life of H.M. Submarine E9. It is true that she was {{commanded}} by Commander Max Horton, but the utter impersonality of the tale makes it as though the boat herself spoke. (Also, never having met or seen any of the gentlemen concerned in the matter, the writer can be impersonal too.) Some time ago, E9 was in the Baltic, in the deeps of winter, where she used to be taken to her hunting grounds by an <b>ice-breaker.</b> Obviously a submarine cannot use her sensitive nose to smash heavy ice with, so the broad-beamed pushing chaperone comes along to see her clear of the thick harbour and shore ice. In the open sea apparently she is left to her own devices. In company of the <b>ice-breaker,</b> then, E9 [...] "proceeded" [...] (neither in the Senior nor the Junior Service does any one officially [...] "go" [...] anywhere) to a [...] "certain position." ...|$|E
60|$|Speaking of {{manufactures}} {{reminds me}} of a talk upon that topic which I heard--which I overheard--on board the Cincinnati boat. I awoke out of a fretted sleep, with a dull confusion of voices in my ears. I listened--two men were talking; subject, apparently, the great inundation. I looked out through the open transom. The two men were eating a late breakfast; sitting opposite each other; nobody else around. They closed up the inundation with a few words--having used it, evidently, as a mere <b>ice-breaker</b> and acquaintanceship-breeder--then they dropped into business. It soon transpired that they were drummers--one belonging in Cincinnati, the other in New Orleans. Brisk men, energetic of movement and speech; the dollar their god, how to get it their religion.|$|E

50|$|The {{first true}} modern sea-going {{icebreaker}} was {{built at the}} turn of the 20th century. Icebreaker Yermak, was built in 1897 at the Armstrong Whitworth naval yards in England under contract from the Russian Navy. The ship borrowed the main principles from Pilot and applied them to the creation of the first polar icebreaker, which was able to run over and crush pack ice. The ship weighed 5,000 tons, and its steam-reciprocating engines delivered 10,000 horsepower. The ship was so well built that it was only finally decommissioned and scrapped in 1963, making it one of the longest serving <b>ice-breakers</b> in the world.|$|R
