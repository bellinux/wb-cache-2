40|$|Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli produce various heat-labile and {{heat-stable}} enterotoxins. STb is a {{low molecular}} weight <b>heat-resistant</b> <b>toxin</b> responsible for diarrhea in farm animals, mainly young pigs. A previous study demonstrated that cells having internalized STb toxin induce epithelial barrier dysfunction through changes in tight junction (TJ) proteins. These modifications contribute probably to the diarrhea observed. To gain insight into the mechanism of increased intestinal permeability following STb exposure we treated human colon cells (T 84) with purified STb toxin after which cells were harvested and proteins extracted. Using a 1 % Nonidet P- 40 -containing solution we investigated the distribution of claudin- 1, a major structural and functional TJ protein responsible for the epithelium impermeability, between membrane (NP 40 -insoluble) and the cytoplasmic (NP- 40 soluble) location. Using immunoblot and confocal microscopy, we observed that treatment of T 84 cell monolayers with STb induced redistribution of claudin- 1. After 24 h, cells grown in Ca++-free medium treated with STb showed about 40 % more claudin- 1 in the cytoplasm compare to the control. Switching from Ca++-free to Ca++-enriched medium (1. 8 mM) increased the dislodgement rate of claudin- 1 as comparable quantitative delocalization was observed after only 6 h. Medium supplemented with the same concentration of Mg++ or Zn++ {{did not affect the}} dislodgement rate compared to the Ca++-free medium. Using anti-phosphoserine and anti-phosphothreonine antibodies, we observed that the loss of membrane claudin- 1 was accompanied by dephosphorylation of this TJ protein. Overall, ou...|$|E
40|$|A <b>heat-resistant,</b> low-molecular-weight <b>toxin</b> was {{isolated}} from semisolid potato dextrose agar medium after inoculation with Flavobacterium farinofermentans sp. nov., which {{was isolated}} from fermented corn meal that caused some outbreaks of food poisoning in China. The toxin was purified by solvent partition, Sephadex LH- 20 gel filtration, and C- 18 reversed-phase column chromatography. Thin-layer chromatography and high-pressure liquid chromatographic methods were {{developed for the}} identification {{and analysis of the}} toxin. The purified toxin exhibited a single spot in thin-layer chromatography and a single peak in high-pressure liquid chromatography and had adsorption maxima at 232 and 267 nm. Mass spectral analysis indicated a molecular weight of 169 with an experimental formula of C 9 H 13 O 3. The 50 % lethal dose of purified toxin in mice (oral) was less than 6. 84 mg/kg, but greater than 0. 68 mg/kg. Postmortem examination showed that the mice died of some type of neurological and cardiovascular system toxicity. The name Flavotoxin A is being assigned to the toxin...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{investigated}} {{the possibility of}} the presence of VTEC strains in improperly pasteurized milk samples. A total of 64 Escherichia coli strains were isolated from 135 pasteurized milk samples originating from the same producer. The examined isolates contained 29 haemolysin-, 9 colicin- and 5 aerobactin-producing strains, but the investigations concerning <b>heat-resistant</b> and heat-sensitive <b>toxins</b> gave negative results. Six O 128 -type E. coli strains exerted a cytotoxic effect on the VERO cell line; 5 of them contained H 12 antigen, while one could not be typed. Four of the 6 verocytotoxin-producing strains belonged in phage group 20, one in phage group (2) 3 (7), and one in phage group 4; four strains were of B 3, one of A 1, and one of A 1 (A 2) phage type. Because of a technical failure the milk was pasteurized at 69 °C for 15 s, which is 2 °C less than required. The results underline the importance of the appropriate pasteurization temperature, as otherwise the milk may contain verocytotoxin-producing E. coli, which is a potentially great hazard for public health...|$|R
