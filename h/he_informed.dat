Senior officers, including general-in-chief Winfield Scott, convinced Beauregard to stay in the United States. He briefly entered politics as a reform candidate for mayor of New Orleans in 1858, where he was promoted by both the Whig and Democratic parties to challenge the Know Nothing party candidate. Beauregard was narrowly defeated.|$|E
5|$|Groves {{met with}} Arnold again in September 1943. <b>He</b> <b>informed</b> Arnold {{that there was}} now a second bomb shape under consideration, the Fat Man, and {{formally}} requested that further tests be carried out, that not more than three B-29s be modified to carry the weapons, and that the USAAF form and train a special unit to deliver the bombs.

John was eventually rescued by John Bellesmains, a fellow Englishman and former Archbishop of Lyon.|$|E

5|$|By July 1941, Morshead {{had become}} {{convinced}} that his troops were becoming tired. Their health was deteriorating and, {{in spite of}} his efforts, their morale and discipline were slipping. <b>He</b> <b>informed</b> Generals Blamey and Auchinleck that they should be relieved. Auchinleck arranged for the 18th Infantry Brigade to be relieved by the Polish Carpathian Brigade so that it could rejoin the 7th Division in August but baulked at relieving the 9th Division. At this point, political considerations came into play. The newly installed government of Prime Minister John Curtin in Australia, on Blamey's advice, took up the matter with Prime Minister Winston Churchill, who protested that the relief would cause a postponement of Operation Crusader. As it turned out, the operation had to be postponed anyway. In October 1941, Morshead and most of the 9th Division was replaced by the British 6th Division. The 9th Division moved to Syria to serve as an occupation force, as well as resting, re-equipping and training reinforcements.|$|E

5|$|Calakmul {{was first}} {{reported}} by Cyrus Lundell in 1931. A year later <b>he</b> <b>informed</b> Sylvanus Morley of the site's existence {{and the presence}} of more than 60 stelae. Morley visited the ruins himself on behalf of the Carnegie Institution of Washington in 1932. In the 1930s surveys mapped the site core and recorded 103 stelae. Investigations stopped in 1938 and archaeologists did not return to the site until 1982 when William J. Folan directed a project on behalf of the Universidad Autónoma de Campeche, working at Calakmul until 1994. Calakmul is now the subject of a large-scale project of the National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) under the direction of Ramón Carrasco.|$|E
5|$|Commissioner Edward Keith-Roach {{described}} {{the screen as}} violating the Ottoman status quo that forbade Jews from making any construction in the Western Wall area. <b>He</b> <b>informed</b> the Jewish community that the removal had been carried out under his orders after receiving a complaint from the Supreme Muslim Council. The Arabs were concerned that the Jews were trying to extend their rights at the wall and with this move, ultimately intended to take possession of the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The British government issued an announcement explaining the incident and blaming the Jewish beadle at the Wall. It stressed that {{the removal of the}} screen was necessary, but expressed regret over the ensuing events.|$|E
5|$|During the Siege of Petersburg, Alexander had {{to adapt}} his {{artillery}} tactics to trench warfare, including experimentation with {{various types of}} mortars.
