Scott Straus from the University of Wisconsin describes the ethnic identities that partially contributed to the Rwandan genocide. In April 1994, following the assassination of Rwanda’s President Juvénal Habyarimana, Hutus of Rwanda turned on their Tutsi neighbors and slaughtered between 500,000 and 800,000 people in just 100 days. While politically this situation was incredibly complex, the influence ethnicity had on the violence cannot be ignored. Before the German colonization of Rwanda, the identities of Hutu and Tutsi were not fixed. Germany ruled Rwanda through the Tutsi dominated monarchy and the Belgians continued this following their takeover. Belgian rule reinforced the difference between Tutsi and Hutu. Tutsis were deemed superior and were propped up as a ruling minority supported by the Belgians, while the Hutu were systematically repressed. The country’s power later dramatically shifted following the so-called Hutu Revolution, during which Rwanda gained independence from their colonizers and formed a new Hutu-dominated government. Deep-seated ethnic tensions did not leave with the Belgians. Instead, the new government reinforced the cleavage.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} is inquiring {{the relationship between}} Javanese immigrant and indigenous Lampungese community phenomenon in South Lampung concerning to intercultural communication. This research uses qualitative paradigm (case study) in which in-depth interview, participant observation, documentation studies are used as data compilation method. The data gathered is then analyzed descriptive qualitatively. The research concludes that Javanese immigrants use three strategies in adapting Lampungese : formal adaptation, natural adaptation, and <b>ethnic</b> identity <b>manipulation.</b> Other than expecting being accepted as Lampungese community, Javanese immigrants use manipulation strategy for economic and politic orientation. In the process of adaptation Javanese faces language, psychological and socio cultural barries. In the interaction, every individuality from each ethnic group has his own perspective and different attitude on their existence and relation toward other ethnic group. Some of Javanese and Lampungese perceiveÂ that all ethnic groups are similar and willing to have equivalent relationship, behave openly and having no distance with other ethnic group. Such type of Javanese and Lampungese are called inculusive Javanese and inclusive Lampungese. On the other hand, exclusive Javanese and Lampungese are {{those who think that}} his own ethnic group is better than the other one and asking for special treatment for that reason. The research also concludes that communicationÂ and interaction dynamics between Javanese and Lampungese is going on circularly in various aspects of life, such as religion, economics, politics and social. The on going communication between the two ethnic groups can be colored by cooperation and competition. Competition is only psychological, it is not resulting conflict. Cooperation is motivated by politics, economics and relegion. For the reason of achieving the same interest, they can break the border of different ethnic group. Javanese and Lampungese ethnic groups in transmigration area in South Lampung are able to manage cultural differences so wisely that they can communicate harmoniously...|$|R

While it points nts out the inherent efficacy of unity in diversity, it also underscores the fact, that for a fledgling democracy anchored mainly on relatively free, fair and periodic elections, the growing number of ethnic conflicts matched {{side by side with the}} polarization tion of the country on ethnic lines which is also aligned to the political division of the country, is an effective atmosphere for the derailment of the effort towards democratic consolidation.

This dissertation analytically describes and assesses the civilian control strategies implemented by three of the most enduring civilian regimes in Africa: Botswana, Ivory Coast and Kenya. It fills a gap in the extensive literature on civil-military relations in Africa which, for decades, has pursued the elusive goal of explaining coups. The study argues that the apparent failure to convincingly explain coups warrants a conceptual shift toward seeking to understand better the long-term effects of the successful coup prevention strategies implemented by the few long-running civilian regimes. This new approach has theory-building potential and normative public policy implications for emerging democracies. The dissertation provides an analytical framework based on the concept of coup vulnerability which refines and adapts the concept of civilian control to the socioeconomic and political realities of Africa. Two mutually reinforcing theoretical assumptions are derived from the literature on civilian control and used to assess the long-term effect of the coup prevention strategies implemented by the states studied. The first is that a civilian regime whose coup prevention strategies entail military professionalism, the insulation of the military from political interference and its autonomy will decrease such a regime's coup vulnerability. Second, I assume that when a civilian regime pursues policies which legitimize the political system in the eyes, of its citizens its vulnerability to military interventions decreases. The evidence suggests that only Botswana's legitimizing policies, which entailed military professionalism, autonomy and political insulation, and the legitimization of the regime in the eyes of citizens (including the military) has significantly reduced its coup vulnerability. In contrast, neither the Ivory Coast nor Kenya implemented similar strategies. Their respective civilian control strategies, (the presence of foreign troops, the <b>ethnic</b> <b>manipulation</b> and politicization of their militaries) have prevented coups thus far but have also increased their coup vulnerability and moved them significantly closer to the praetorian end of the coup vulnerability continuum. One public policy implication of this finding is that only Botswana provides Africa's emerging democracies with an example worth emulating...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to deepen our {{understanding}} of the linkages between urban dynamics that influence access, use and ownership of land in developing countries. This is because land scarcity, increased competition for land and inequitable allocation of land in African cities and the mediation of power, politics, ethnicity and corruption, coupled with inequitable access to land, often contribute to conflicts over land. The thesis explores this reality through the case of Nairobi. Two arguments premise this thesis; one argument posits that urban land conflicts persisting in Africa are largely resulting from land commodification which is not in conformity with existing African land relations. The second argument is that the persistence of urban inequity well beyond colonialism into the present time has produced reinforced inequity in access to and ownership, thereby producing patronage, ethnic and corrupt approaches to land management and allocation processes. These have invariably led land conflicts. As such the study sought to answer one major question that could help establish the links between land scarcity, ethnicity, corruption and conflicts. The question is: {{what is the relationship between}} land conflicts and inequity? The thesis aimed to explain the linkage between land commodification processes and inequity, exploring the nature, causes, extent, dimensions and dynamics of land conflicts. It further sought to explore the linkage of the existing institutional arrangements to urban land conflicts. It anticipated the drawing of conclusions on the linkages between land conflicts, land management, commodification, ethnicity, corruption and political patronage and how these linkages contribute to inequity and, subsequently, land conflicts. The study applied a qualitative case study approach, exploring the relationships between land conflicts and inequity. Four in depth case studies, Tassia, Embakasi Jua Klai, Pipeline and Mathare North, were conducted in Nairobi. The study drew on a combination of theories, including <b>ethnic</b> <b>manipulation,</b> structure and agency, institutional analysis, uneven development, grounded theories and group interest. These helped in the analysis and informed the data collection approaches. In addition, they assisted in the development of appropriate explanations of the dynamics between factors such as ethnicity, corruption, and the market, among others. In drawing conclusions, they were useful in unraveling the relationships between land conflicts and the various mediating factors. The results from this study include the establishment of the fact that urban land conflicts result from social, political and economic factors. The factors are mediated by several factors that are institutional, ethnic and patronage-based. The thesis reveals the linkage between ethnicity and corruption, and the simultaneous relationships between power, corruption, institutions and ethnicity. For the Nairobi case, the study brings to the fore the central role of ethnicity in resource conflicts. It also reveals the dynamic nature of land conflicts, thereby suggesting that land issues are social, economic and political. Addressing land conflicts conclusively requires a careful political process that must also be embedded in the legal systems of the particular country. The study concludes by proposing areas for further study, including ethnicity and land ownership in Kenya’s urban areas; corruption, politics and landlordism in Nairobi; land markets and conflicts in urban areas; the development of appropriate models for urban land management, and the links between land tenure and conflicts over land in urban area...|$|E
