Therefore, the use of <b>ergonomic</b> production <b>methods</b> to prevent this can have a significant human, social and financial impact. This paper presents a case study of comparative analyses of ergonomic situations for concrete workers performing concrete casting processes. <b>Ergonomic</b> risk assessment <b>methods</b> were used to assess the physical strain, hand-arm vibration and noise affects risks involved in concrete casting work tasks. The combination of technical and managerial factors results in a system where workers are as efficient and safe as possible during their work tasks, and thus, makes the construction work environment sustainable. The preliminary study presented in this paper concludes that the present ergonomic risks emanating from work methods used in the normally vibrated concrete (NVC) casting can be significantly reduced. With the use of self-compacting concrete (SCC) awkward work postures, hand-arm vibration and noise are eliminated. Thus musculoskeletal injuries can be reduced if not eliminated among concrete workers during their concrete casting work tasks. Godkänd; 2009; 20090929 (rorw...|$|R
40|$|Imagine {{having to}} {{identify}} a critical flaw in a highly complex planetoid-sized orbital battle station under extreme time pressure, and with no clear idea at the outset where the vulnerability will lie? This was the challenge faced by the Rebel Alliance in the film Star Wars. One of the belligerents, the Imperial Empire, considered it highly unlikely a weakness would be found even if the other combatant were {{in possession of a}} full technical readout of the station. How could it be done? The first option presented in this paper is to employ traditional error identification methods of the sort contemporaneous with the film's release in 1977 and still in widespread use today. The findings show the limitations of this deterministic world-view because the method selected did not predict the actual vulnerability exploited. The second option is to use a systems-based method to model the Death Star's functional constraints and affordances and use this to assess the system's resilience. This method did detect the film ending, and several others. What began as an amusing aside has turned into a highly effective means to communicate across disciplines and enhance ergonomic teaching and learning. It also provides a compelling narrative around the use of reductionist methods for systems problems, and some wider implications for <b>ergonomic</b> <b>method</b> selection in more earth-bound settings...|$|R

40|$|The {{indirect}} {{and direct}} cost of occupational musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) cause a significant {{burden on the}} health system, and lower back pain (LBP) {{is associated with a}} significant portion of MSDs. In Australia, there is a high prevalence of MSDs for health care workers, such as nurses. Two digital human models (DHMs) Siemens JACK and imk EMA were used to investigate if hospital bed pushing, a simple task and hazard that is commonly associated with LBP, can be validly simulated and ergonomically assessed in a virtual environment. While JACK and EMA have implemented a range of common physical work assessment methods, the simulation of a dynamic task such as bed pushing remains a challenge due to the complex interface between the environment, object, interface and other factors, which can only be insufficiently modelled. In addition, it was found that both human simulation systems present limitations that need to be considered during the interpretation of the results.

One method of rehabilitation is functional electrical stimulation (FES). FES is a technique where small electrical currents are applied {{to the surface of}} the user’s legs to stimulate the muscles. Studies have demonstrated the benefits of using this method and it has also been incorporated into a number of devices. The aim of the project was to produce a number of designs for a new device that uses FES technology. The project was completed in conjunction with an industrial partner. A review of the literature and consultation with industrial experts suggested a number of ways current devices could be improved. These included encouraging the user to lean forwards while walking and powering the device using a more <b>ergonomic</b> <b>method.</b> A group of designers were used to produce designs that allowed the user to walk with a more natural gait and avoided cumbersome power packs. The most effective of these designs were combined to form one design that solved both problems. A 3 -dimensional model of this design was simulated using computer-aided design software. Groups of engineers, scientists and consumers were also invited to provide input on how a new device should function. Each of these groups provided a design that reflected their specific needs, depending on their experience with similar technology. Low level prototypes were produced of these designs. A group of designers were also used to design concepts for a functional electrical stimulation device based on an introduction given by industry experts. Each of the designs was presented to experienced professionals to obtain feedback.

40|$|The {{change at}} work in the context of {{technology}} change has affected human’s health in relation to their working condition, attitude, and MSDs risk factors. These changes were included: adopting new tools, work concept work environments, and work system. <b>Ergonomic</b> <b>methods,</b> can be applied as tools for identify, evaluate these effects of the changes whether they give better health and work condition to workers. The purpose of this thesis is to apply the <b>ergonomic</b> <b>methods</b> to evaluate/identify the work conditions, MSD risk factors where the change at work existed for preventing MSDs in the context of technology change. This thesis compiled with 5 studies as followed: Study I, the Proprioceptive derivation (Pd) concept has introduced to Thai dentistry, and the aim {{of this study was to}} assess the working conditions and the attitude among experienced users. Questionnaires were distributed among 12 dentists. The results showed that the Pd concept seems to reduce the stress level of dentists, but the continuous sitting posture adopted is a risk for back pain in dentists, from the ergonomic point of view. The Pd concept with a dental bed can provide easy accessibility to patients with physical limitations and it results in a lower stress level among dentists. Most dentists who used Pd found it useful. Study II, the aim of this study was to investigate the differences in dentist’s working posture when adopting different work concepts: - Pd and Conventional concept. The observation methods and RULA assessment were applied. The result showed differences in dentists’ sitting posture, clock- related working position, and RULA score. It implied that Pd concept helps the dentists to discover new ways to position themselves, and working comfortably and effectively, which made it possible for the dentists to adopt better working posture and have lower RULA score. Study III, a redesigned cleaning tool was introduced to the cleaners. The physiological, trunk posture and subjective assessment were measured. The results found that floor cleaning in the train wagons is associated with moderately high cardiovascular load and high frequency of stressful working postures. An introduction of the redesigned cleaning tool allowed cleaners to maintain more upright posture while cleaning, which reduce biomechanical and physiological loads on them. Study IV, applied participatory ergonomic method for identification of the cleaning problems and to evaluate the effect of the low-cost improvement on the cleanersด working posture by using OWAS method. Results showed through participatory ergonomics method cleaning problem was identified, and ergonomic solution suggested by cleaners were implemented as low-cost improvement. A low-cost improvement has improved the working posture of cleaners by eliminating the awkward working postures such as sitting on one and two bent knees, and arm above the shoulder. Study V, ergonomic and production system effectiveness are evaluated in a case of a production system redesign: from parallel flow dock-based, to serial flow line-based assembly. The line-based system displayed much tighter coupling of operators to the technical system and introduced system, balance and downtime losses. We observed reductions in: cycle times to 6 % of previous, decision latitude, influence and control over work, perceived work load, and perception of available pauses. Layout and technology changes helped improve co-worker interaction and support, and reduce instances, but not magnitude, of peak spinal loading. It is concluded that serial flows can negatively affect psychosocial conditions and, if losses are high, reduce physical workload. An ‘Action Group’ has been formed in the company to adopt an evidence-based approach to the development of systems that are sustainable from both productivity and ergonomics perspectives. In conclusion, technology changes can give both positive and negative effects on the humans’ health. <b>Ergonomic</b> <b>methods</b> can be used to evaluate these effects. Self-reported questionnaire can give the information on working condition, and attitude of the people working under the change in technology. RULA and OWAS were very useful for identifying and analyzing the postural risk factor. Direct measurement such as physiological responses was useful to identified work load on human body. Participatory ergonomic is also a very useful method for identifying problem, and possible solutions for improving the working conditions. Further, the results from ergonomic evaluation can provide useful information which is needed for future intervention or work-system design in each industry for preventing MSDs at the work place.

40|$|AbstractA {{dramatically}} increasing {{trend in}} the population of aircraft painters with permanent physical limitations was identified among participants in the return-to-work program at a large aircraft maintenance facility. The increase came primarily from painters who had used a full-depth mechanical sanding depainting process. A detailed ergonomic assessment of the process was begun to elicit details of the range and types of risks faced by painters in that shop, and determine what types of mitigation might be utilized to minimize the prevalence of injury. Shoulder injuries represent the biggest area of ergonomic risk for painters. Cervical problems, hand/wrist problems, and lumbar problems make {{up the majority of}} the remainder of injuries. The extent, duration, and complexity of the risks involved in the depaint process required more data than the typical observational and psychophysical assessment tools could provide. Inertial motion capture and tool force instrumentation was implemented in combination with the typical <b>ergonomic</b> <b>methods</b> to provide more details as to the biomechanical sources of risk and how this varies throughout the depainting process. The results indicate surprisingly high normal forces on the palm sander, with rapid muscle fatigue and frequent postural substitution evident during overhead sanding. The long duration of this overhead activity, in combination with the evidence of fatigue, implicates the development of risky scapulo-humeral kinematics and end-of-range glenohumeral motion in the etiology of shoulder and cervical injuries.

40|$|International {{audience}} The aims of {{this study}} were 1) to assess the ergonomic physical risk factors from practitioner's viewpoint in a truck assembly plant with an in-house observational method and the NIOSH lifting equation, and 2) to compare the results of both methods and their differences. The in-house <b>ergonomic</b> observational <b>method</b> for truck assembly i. e. the SCANIA Ergonomics Standard (SES) and the NIOSH lifting equation were applied to evaluate physical risk factors and lifting of loads by operators. Both risk assessment approaches revealed various levels of risk, ranging from low to high. Two workstations were identified by the SES method as high risk. The NIOSH lifting index (LI) was greater than two for four lifting tasks. The results of the SES method disagreed with the NIOSH lifting equation for lifting tasks. Moreover, meaningful variations in ergonomic risk patterns were found for various truck models at each workstation. These results provide {{a better understanding of the}} physical ergonomic exposure from practitioner's point of view in the automotive assembly plant. </p...|$|R
