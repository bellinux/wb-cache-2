5|$|A {{series of}} 13 TARDISODEs were also produced. These mini-episodes (approximately 60 seconds in length) served as prequels to each {{forthcoming}} episode, and {{were available for}} download to mobile phones and viewable at the official Doctor Who website. The TARDISODEs were recorded <b>intermittently</b> from 31 January to 8 April 2006.|$|E
5|$|As with {{previous}} Van der Graaf Generator albums, the band collaborated with producer John Anthony at Trident Studios, who {{had established a}} good working relationship with the band. However, recording for H to He was sporadic, and occurred <b>intermittently</b> between gigs throughout 1970.|$|E
5|$|Diagnostic or {{therapeutic}} {{manipulation of}} the airway (such as bronchoscopy, laser therapy or stenting of the bronchi) may <b>intermittently</b> interfere {{with the ability to}} breathe; intubation may be necessary in such situations.|$|E
5|$|In 1966 BBC {{television}} screened a {{new musical}} quiz, Face the Music presented by Joseph Cooper. It ran <b>intermittently</b> until 1984. Levin {{was a frequent}} panel member along with, among others, Robin Ray, Joyce Grenfell, David Attenborough and Richard Baker.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1920s Poulenc {{remained}} concerned at {{his lack of}} formal musical training. Satie was suspicious of music colleges, but Ravel advised Poulenc to take composition lessons; Milhaud suggested the composer and teacher Charles Koechlin. Poulenc worked with him <b>intermittently</b> from 1921 to 1925.|$|E
5|$|Radiohead {{worked on}} The King of Limbs with {{longtime}} producer Nigel Godrich <b>intermittently</b> from May 2009 to January 2011. Like their sixth album, Hail to the Thief (2003), it {{was recorded in}} Los Angeles, possibly {{at the home of}} actress Drew Barrymore, who is thanked in the album's liner notes.|$|E
5|$|Since 2007, Minogue's musical {{career has}} mainly been on hiatus, only {{releasing}} the odd song <b>intermittently</b> {{due to her}} focusing on television presenting and her fashion label, Project D.|$|E
5|$|The Bury St Edmunds witch {{trials were}} {{a series of}} trials {{conducted}} <b>intermittently</b> between the years 1599 and 1694 {{in the town of}} Bury St Edmunds in Suffolk, England.|$|E
5|$|The fore gut of {{some species}} extends the whole {{length of the}} insect {{and can be used}} to store prey for {{digestion}} later. This may be advantageous in an insect that feeds <b>intermittently.</b> Chinese mantises live longer, grow faster, and produce more young when they are able to eat pollen.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} bred in Iceland since about 1999, and was {{widespread}} by 2004, although numbers {{are affected by}} hard winters. Breeds occurs <b>intermittently</b> in the Faroes. The goldcrest has occurred as a vagrant in Jordan and Morocco.|$|E
5|$|About 20% are {{affected}} by symptomatic digestive tract lesions, although a higher percentage have lesions that do not cause symptoms. These lesions may bleed <b>intermittently,</b> which is rarely significant enough to be noticed (in the form of bloody vomiting or black stool), but can eventually lead to depletion of iron in the body, resulting in iron-deficiency anemia.|$|E
5|$|Although Yorkshire and Lancashire were {{traditionally}} {{more relaxed}} about professionalism than other counties, cricket {{did not see}} the same regional schisms on the topic that rugby and football did – there were debates over amateur status in first-class cricket, but these tensions were given release in the Gentlemen v Players fixture. Nevertheless, the annual North v South games were among the most popular and competitive in the sport, running annually from 1849 until 1900 and <b>intermittently</b> thereafter.|$|E
5|$|An earlier {{black-and-white}} {{adaptation of}} M. R. James's Whistle and I'll Come to You, directed by Jonathan Miller and shown {{as part of}} the series Omnibus in 1968, is often cited as an influence upon the production of the films, and is sometimes included {{as part of the}} series. The series was revived by the BBC in 2005 with a new set of adaptations that were produced <b>intermittently</b> over the next few years.|$|E
5|$|Before {{directing}} The Sopranos, many of {{the directors}} had worked on other television series and in independent films. The most frequent directors of the series were Tim Van Patten (20 episodes), John Patterson (13 episodes), Allen Coulter (12 episodes), and Alan Taylor (9 episodes), {{all of whom have}} a background in television. Recurring cast members Steve Buscemi and Peter Bogdanovich also directed episodes of the series <b>intermittently.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning in late 2014, Waldroff and Simshaw {{listed the}} {{building}} and business for sale <b>intermittently,</b> and sold Starky's for $1.2 million in March 2015. The duo planned to retire and expressed a willingness to sell {{the rights to the}} name and business. The bar and restaurant closed on September 13, 2015, after operating for 28 years. The building that housed Starky's was demolished during November–December 2015, and was replaced by a three-story apartment building.|$|E
5|$|Giant mouse lemurs {{were first}} {{studied in the}} wild by Petter and colleagues in 1971. His {{observations}} were secondary to his primary research interest, the fork-marked lemurs north of Morondava. Both northern and southern populations were studied <b>intermittently</b> between 1978 and 1981, and in 1993, long-term social and genetic studies began in Kirindy Forest. Behavioral studies of captive individuals have also been performed at the Duke Lemur Center (DLC) in Durham, North Carolina during the 1990s.|$|E
5|$|Hirst {{played only}} <b>intermittently</b> for Yorkshire {{over the next}} couple of seasons, but {{continued}} to develop as a cricketer, signing as a professional for Elland Cricket Club for the 1890 season before joining Mirfield in 1891. During that season, he made his first-class debut for Yorkshire against Somerset in the County Championship; he scored 15 runs and took two wickets in the game.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} part of his career, he {{wrestled}} for many different promotions. After making his debut for UWA, Konnan wrestled for the UWA Heavyweight title against El Canek at UWA 14 on January 29, 1989, and wrestled six- and eight-man tag matches <b>intermittently</b> for the promotion until 1994, with the likes of Dos Caras, Mascara Sagrada, and others. All of his matches for UWA after 1991 were cross-promotions with EMLL and AAA.|$|E
5|$|Neild's family {{arrived in}} Australia in 1860, {{and he worked}} as an {{insurance}} agent and company manager before winning election to the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1885. He served <b>intermittently</b> until 1901 and had a tumultuous career as a backbencher, eventually contributing significantly to {{the fall of the}} Reid government in 1899. He also established his own volunteer regiment, which had a difficult and sometimes hostile relationship with military command.|$|E
5|$|Project Chanology {{began its}} {{campaign}} by organizing and delivering {{a series of}} denial-of-service attacks against Scientology websites and flooding Scientology centers with prank calls and black faxes. The group was successful in taking down local and global Scientology websites <b>intermittently</b> from January 18, 2008 until at least January 25, 2008. Anonymous had early success rendering major Scientology websites inaccessible and leaking documents allegedly stolen from Scientology computers. This resulted in {{a large amount of}} coverage on social bookmarking websites.|$|E
5|$|Several long-standing {{services}} from Victoria ended during the British Rail era. The Brighton Belle's final service was on 30 April 1972, {{followed by the}} last Golden Arrow on 30 September. The Night Ferry lasted until 31 October 1980, though the Venice-Simplon Orient Express, a luxury Pullman service, has been running <b>intermittently</b> since 1982.|$|E
5|$|The British {{colony of}} Hong Kong had been {{captured}} by Japanese forces in December 1941, and was subsequently used as a naval and logistics base. USAAF units based in China <b>intermittently</b> attacked the Hong Kong area from October 1942. Most of these raids involved {{a small number of}} aircraft, and typically targeted Japanese cargo ships which had been reported by Chinese guerrillas.|$|E
5|$|The Euston {{commission}} {{seems to}} have brought Brettingham firmly to the notice of other wealthy patrons. In 1751, he began work for the Earl of Egremont at Petworth House, Sussex. He continued work <b>intermittently</b> at Petworth for the next twelve years, including designing a new picture gallery from 1754. Over the same period his country-house work included alterations at Moor Park, Hertfordshire; Wortley Hall, Yorkshire; Wakefield Lodge, Northamptonshire; and Benacre House, Suffolk.|$|E
5|$|The Pike-Pawnee Village Site, or Hill Farm Site, {{designated}} 25WT1 by archaeologists, is a {{site near}} the village of Guide Rock in Webster County, in the south central portion of the state of Nebraska, in the Great Plains region of the United States. It was the location of a village of the Kitkehahki band of the Pawnee people, in a region of the Republican River valley that they occupied <b>intermittently</b> from the 1770s to the 1820s.|$|E
5|$|The Scottish Symphony (Symphony No. 3 in A minor) {{was written}} and revised <b>intermittently</b> between 1829 (when Mendelssohn noted down the opening theme {{during a visit}} to Holyrood Palace) and 1842, when it was given its premiere in Leipzig, the last of his symphonies to be {{performed}} in public. This piece evokes Scotland's atmosphere in the ethos of Romanticism, but does not employ any identified Scottish folk melodies.|$|E
5|$|The volcano is {{currently}} unglaciated despite its height, {{due to the}} aridity of the climate. The Quebrada de Chaigüire valley originates {{at the foot of}} Aucanquilcha. The Rio Loa river drains the western and northwestern sides of the volcano; the eastern side drains into the Salar de Ollagüe salt pan, the northeastern into the Salar de Laguani, and the southeastern into the Salar de Carcote. Most valleys only <b>intermittently</b> transport water, if at all.|$|E
5|$|This article lists all the short-list nominees and {{winners in}} the best science fiction novel category, as well as novels that have {{received}} honourable mentions. Since 2003, honourable mentions have been awarded <b>intermittently.</b> Damien Broderick has won the award three times, while six have won it twice – K. A. Bedford, Greg Egan, Amie Kaufman, Jay Kristoff, Sean McMullen, and Sean Williams. Williams holds the record for most nominations with 14.|$|E
5|$|This is a monogamous {{territorial}} species, and {{in areas}} where it is fully migratory, the male re-establishes its breeding territory and starts singing {{as soon as he}} returns. In the milder areas where some birds stay year round, the resident male remains in his breeding territory, singing <b>intermittently,</b> but the female may establish a separate individual wintering range until pair formation begins in the early spring.|$|E
5|$|A small {{contingent}} of Hawker Hunters deployed to Sweden in 1965 for training in air-to-ground delivery of ordnance, and <b>intermittently</b> thereafter, but annual training abroad for the Swiss Air Force {{did not begin}} until 1985. The use of Swiss air space for combat training became increasingly impractical as the performance of supersonic jets increased and created environmental restrictions. The Swiss modified their traditional stance of neutrality to seek other facilities, particularly among NATO European members, to meet their training needs.|$|E
5|$|Able {{to attack}} the HEIC ships individually, Caroline pulled {{alongside}} Europe at 06:30 and began a heavy fire into the merchant ship, which <b>intermittently</b> replied with her available guns. Within 30 minutes, Europes rigging was tattered, many of her guns dismounted {{and a number of}} her crew wounded or killed. Moving past his now disabled opponent, Féretier next attacked Streatham, which had slowed in an unsuccessful attempt to support Europe. Now alone against the frigate, Streatham came under heavy fire at 07:00 and by 08:00 was badly damaged, with casualties in her crew, her guns all dismounted and her lascars hiding below decks. With further resistance hopeless, Dale hauled down the company flag and surrendered.|$|E
5|$|After 1994, {{when the}} American musicians Curtis Mayfield and Frank Sinatra were both issued Grammy Legend Awards, the honors {{have been given}} to {{recording}} artists <b>intermittently.</b> Italian operatic tenor Luciano Pavarotti was the 1998 recipient of the award. The following year, British singer-songwriter Elton John was recognized with the honor. The Bee Gees became the first recipients of the award in the 21st century when the brothers were acknowledged by the Grammys in 2003. Overall, fourteen solo musicians and one band have received the Grammy Legend Award.|$|E
5|$|Although France were {{represented}} at the 1900 Summer Olympics, their first official test match {{did not take}} place till New Year's Day, 1906 against the New Zealand All Blacks in Paris. France then played <b>intermittently</b> against the Home Nations until they joined them to form the Five Nations tournament in 1910. In 1913 France faced South Africa's Springboks for the first time; losing 38–5. France also competed at the 1920 and 1924 Summer Olympics, and on both occasions lost to the United States in the gold medal match, Vicky LeDonne scored the winning goal.|$|E
5|$|Although outnumbered ten-to-one by the Pakistani troops, the Sikhs {{repelled}} {{their attacks}} multiple times. With their ammunition running out, Singh ordered {{his men to}} join the main company, knowing that reinforcement was impossible under Pakistani shelling. With the help of another soldier, he brought two injured men along, though he himself was wounded. Under the heavy Pakistani fire, Singh moved from position to position, boosting the morale of his men and <b>intermittently</b> throwing grenades. Despite being wounded twice, he refused evacuation and continued to hold {{the first line of}} trenches.|$|E
5|$|Among animals, {{there exists}} a single known example of an {{apparently}} freely-rotating structure, though it is used for digestion rather than propulsion: the crystalline style of certain bivalves and gastropods. The style consists of a transparent glycoprotein rod which is continuously formed in a cilia-lined sac and extends into the stomach. The cilia rotate the rod, so that it becomes wrapped in strands of mucus. As the rod slowly dissolves in the stomach, it releases digestive enzymes. Estimates {{of the speed of}} rotation of the style in vivo vary significantly, and it is unclear if the style is rotated continuously or <b>intermittently.</b>|$|E
5|$|Benzodiazepines can {{be useful}} for {{short-term}} treatment of insomnia. Their use beyond 2 to 4 weeks is not recommended due {{to the risk of}} dependence. It is preferred that benzodiazepines be taken <b>intermittently</b> and at the lowest effective dose. They improve sleep-related problems by shortening the time spent in bed before falling asleep, prolonging the sleep time, and, in general, reducing wakefulness. However, they worsen sleep quality by increasing light sleep and decreasing deep sleep. Other drawbacks of hypnotics, including benzodiazepines, are possible tolerance to their effects, rebound insomnia, and reduced slow-wave sleep and a withdrawal period typified by rebound insomnia and a prolonged period of anxiety and agitation.|$|E
