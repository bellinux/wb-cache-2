40|$|The Pliocene Sajau coals of the Berau Basin {{area have}} a {{moderately}} to highly developed cleat system. Mostly the cleat fractures are well developed in both bright and dull bands, and these cleats are generally inclined or {{perpendicular to the}} bedding planes of the seam. The presence <b>of</b> <b>cleat</b> networks/fractures in coal seam is the important point in coalbed methane prospect. The 3 D X-ray computed tomography (CT) technique was performed to identify cleats characteristics in the Sajau coal seams, such as the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> coal <b>cleats,</b> geometry <b>of</b> <b>cleat,</b> and cleats mineralization. By CT scan imaging technique {{two different types of}} natural fractures observed in Sajau coals have been identified, that is, face cleats and butt cleats. This technique also identified the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> face <b>cleats</b> and butt cleats as shown in the resulting 3 D images. Based on the images, face cleats show a NNE-SSW direction while butt cleats have a NW-SE direction. The crosscutting relationship indicated that NNE-SSW cleats were formed earlier than NW-SE cleats. The procedure also identified the types of minerals that filled the cleats apertures. Based on their density, the minerals are categorized as follows: very high density minerals (pyrite), high density minerals (anastase), and low density minerals (kaolinite, calcite) were identified filling the cleats aperture...|$|R

Locally the folds trend N 2020 E 21220, the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the butt <b>cleat</b> in the Lower Kittanning coal. The face cleat strikes at N 6920 W 21220 and the systematic rock joint in the surface bedrock strikes N 6720 W 21220 This suggests that a directional stress oriented N 7020 W produced the folds and influenced the <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> coal <b>cleat</b> and systematic joint sets.

Most of the gas comes from strata above the mined coal; therefore, to control methane, roof instability must be controlled. Roof falls and high rates of methane emission are most likely where less than 30 feet of many thin layers of limestone, shale, and sandstone occurs between the Lower Kittanning coal and the next coal and in zones along the margins of a sandstone channel...|$|R
40|$|The natural {{vertical}} fracture sys tem in bituminous coalbeds {{is called}} cleat. Cleat orientation commonly controls the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> mining with major development paralleling the face cleat. Previous researchers have categorized the origin <b>of</b> <b>cleat</b> as endogenetic, relating the origin <b>of</b> <b>cleat</b> to compaction and coalification, and exogenetic, relating the origin <b>of</b> <b>cleat</b> to tectonic forces.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} relationship between cleat spacing, cleat height and coal banding texture for Queensland Permian age coals of different rank, four of which are presented here. Whereas relationships between cleat frequency and rank, and with coal type or grade, {{have been reported in}} the past, relationships between the spacing and height among the different kinds <b>of</b> <b>cleats</b> are not quantitatively established. For other layered sedimentary rocks, joint or fracture spacing relates directly to both bed thickness and rock strength. Coal is similar to other layers rocks. Four major classes <b>of</b> <b>cleats</b> were distinguished, which were separate data populations when cleat spacing was plotted against cleat height; master cleats, single vitrain layer cleats, multiple vitrain layer package cleats, and durain (dull coal) cleats. Understanding the relationship between cleat height and spacing for specific coals, and the specific kinds <b>of</b> <b>cleats</b> within those coals, will lead to more accurate predictions <b>of</b> <b>cleat</b> density and hence coal permeability. This can improve modelling and prediction of methane gas deliverability in coal seams.

40|$|Cleats {{are natural}} opening-mode {{fractures}} in coal beds.

Although the coal–cleat literature spans at least 160 years, mining issues have been the principal focus, and quantitative data are almost exclusively limited to orientation and spacing information. Few data are available on apertures, heights, lengths, connectivity, and the relation <b>of</b> <b>cleat</b> formation to diagenesis, characteristics that are critical to permeability. Moreover, recent studies <b>of</b> <b>cleat</b> orientation patterns and fracture style suggest that new investigations of even these well-studied parameters can yield insight into coal permeability.

Current regulations to assess laceration injury risk <b>of</b> <b>cleated</b> footwear involve two optional mechanical tests for manufacturers: a drop test and a pendulum test. However, there is limited rationale for these tests and associated impact parameters.

In other words, loading stress vertical to face cleats can be much easier to narrow the aperture <b>of</b> face <b>cleats</b> <b>of</b> the intact coal sample. Besides, the broken coal sample under higher stress level shows higher permeability than that of the intact coal under lower stress environment.

40|$|Production {{of methane}} gas from coal seams is {{becoming}} {{very popular in}} the USA and also in Australia, as a natural source for clean gas. Coalbed methane (CBM) is classified as an unconventional reservoir, for which hydraulic fracturing is a commonly used stimulation technique to enhance production. A successful fracturing job {{is the one that}} provides maximum exposure to the natural fracture systems or cleats existing in the coal seam. The production from a coal seam depends highly on the permeability <b>of</b> both <b>cleats</b> and the coal itself. Drilling horizontal wells within the reservoir layer will increase the exposure of the formation with the wellbore wall and therefore it is a desired well trajectory to be used for CBM production. Depending on the stress regime a hydraulic fracture initiated in a vertical or a horizontal well could propagate longitudinally within the coal layer or transversely where the fracture develops in a plane nearly perpendicular to the coal seam plane. Also, fluid flow behaviour would be different depending on the production type, i. e. openhole or cemented liner with perforations. For example, in case of production from a cemented horizontal well with few perforations in place, the fluid may travel a shorter distance within the hydraulic fracture, but there would be a significant flow convergence around the perforation tunnels before the gas enters into the wellbore. In production from a transversely oriented fracture, however, the gas will travel a long distance within the fracture plane and will converge around a very small wellbore: a high fluid velocity is expected in this case. In this paper simple 2 D simulations were carried out in order to investigate the change in production as a function <b>of</b> <b>cleats</b> and coal layer permeabilities. Also, the effects <b>of</b> <b>cleat</b> density and structures were studied. Change in flow behaviour as a result of horizontal drilling was investigated. Hydraulic fractures were considered in modelling and the results showed how gas flow will be improved by providing a larger exposure to the coal seam and intersecting larger number <b>of</b> <b>cleats.</b> Simulations were performed using ANSYS software.

30|$|Cleats are systematic, natural {{fractures}} in coal seams. They account {{for most of}} the permeability and much of the porosity of coalbed methane reservoirs and can {{have a significant effect on}} the success of hydraulic fracturing stimulation. Laboratory hydraulic fracturing experiments were conducted on coal blocks under true tri-axial stress to simulate fracturing stimulation of coal seams. Fractures were initiated by injecting a water gel with luminous yellow fluorescent dye into an open hole section of a wellbore. The impact <b>of</b> <b>cleats</b> on initiation and propagation of hydraulic {{fractures in}} coal seams is discussed. Three types of hydraulic fracture initiation and propagation pattern were observed in this study: 1) The hydraulic fracture initiated and then grew along the cleat. 2) The hydraulic fracture initiated along a butt cleat or a fracture (natural or induced by drilling) oriented roughly in the minimum horizontal stress direction, then turned to propagate along the first face cleat that it encountered or gradually turned towards the maximum horizontal stress direction. 3) The hydraulic fracture initiated perpendicular to the minimum stress and, when it encountered a face cleat, tended to propagate along the cleats if the extension direction does not deviate greatly (< 20 ° as determined in this paper) from the maximum horizontal stress direction. When a coal seam is hydraulically fractured, the resulting fracture network is controlled by the combined effect <b>of</b> several factors: <b>cleats</b> determine the initiation and extension path of the fracture, the in-situ stress state dominates the main <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> the fracture zone and bedding planes impede fracture height growth.|$|R
