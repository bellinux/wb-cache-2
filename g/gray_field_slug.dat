50|$|In {{a popular}} {{publication}} quoted below occurs the following notice of a well-known land mollusk, {{in connection with}} a traditionary story of the plague, which has long had general currency in Scotland: ‘In the woodlands, the more formidable black nude slug, the Arion or Limax, will also be often encountered. It is a huge voracious creature, herbivorous, feeding, to Barbara’s astonishment, on tender plants; fruits, as strawberries, apples; and even turnips and mushrooms; appearing morning and evening, or after rain; suffering severely in its concealment in long droughts, and remaining torpid in winter. The <b>gray</b> <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> (Limax agrestis) is actually recommended to be swallowed by consumptive patients! In the town of Dundee there exists a strange traditionary story of the plague, connected with the conversion, from dire necessity of the Arion ater, or black slug, to a use similar to that which the luxurious Romans are said to have made of the great apple-snail. Two young and blooming maidens lived together at that dread time, like Bessie Bell and Mary Gray, in a remote cottage on the steep (indeed almost perpendicular) ascent of the Bonnetmaker’s Hill. Deprived of friends or support by the pestilence that walked at noonday, they still retained their good looks and healthful aspect, even when the famine had succeeded to the plague. The jaundiced eyes of the famine-wasted wretches around them were instantly turned towards the poor girls, who appeared to thrive so well whilst others were famishing. They were unhesitatingly accused of witchcraft, and had nearly fallen a prey to that terrible charge; for betwixt themselves they had sworn never to tell in words by what means they were supported, ashamed as they felt of the resource to which they had been driven; and resolved, if possible, to escape the anticipated derision of their neighbours on its disclosure. It was only when about to be dragged before their stern inquisitors, that one of the girls, drawing aside the covering of a great barrel which stood in a corner of their domicile, discovered, without violating her oath, that the youthful pair had been driven to the desperate necessity of collecting and preserving for food large quantities of these Limacinae, which they ultimately acknowledged to have proved to them generous and even agreeable sustenance. To the credit of the times of George Wishart—a glimpse of pre-reforming enlightenment—the explanation sufficed; the young women escaped with their lives, and were even applauded for their prudence.|$|E
40|$|Recently I {{have heard}} reports of slug damage to corn, soybean and sunflower. This {{particularly}} wet time in Iowa may be conducive to slugs. Although slugs aren 2 ̆ 7 t insects (legs or wings are absent and lack a segmented body), they often get lumped {{in with the}} bugs. Slugs have a head with a mouth, sensory tentacles and simple eyes. A simple foot produces mucus which aids in water conservation and movement. As slugs move, they leave a trail of mucus behind, {{sometimes referred to as}} a slime trail. Because they lack a hardened shell, slugs are able to move through small spaces and soil crevices.

Here we document rapid loss of molluscicidal bait pellets to earthworms and the resulting adverse effects on slug control. Three years of field studies were conducted at 17 locations with contrasting crops, soil types, residue levels, and tillage management programs. Baits were isolated in covered, sunken, open bottom arenas in the field to exclude removal by slugs, rodents, or birds. Forty hours of nighttime field observations and photographic documentation were collected to support the hypothesis that earthworms were removing slug bait before it had the opportunity to kill slugs. Greenhouse studies were conducted on the <b>gray</b> <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> (Derocerus reticula turn Mueller), in screen-topped arenas to determine the effects on mortality, seedling survival, and egg fecundity in a bait-depleting environment.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The grey <b>field</b> <b>slug</b> Deroceras reticulatum {{has become}} a pest in no tillage {{sunflower}} (Helianthus annuus L.) and soybean (Glycine max L.) crops in the southeast of Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Ground beetles (Coleoptera: Carabidae) are {{an important component of}} the arthropod community in agricultural systems and have the potential to reduce pest populations. We tested the predation capacity of the carabid beetle Scarites anthracinus on Deroceras reticulatum individuals of different body mass (10, 20 and 30 mg) and on their eggs, in a controlled laboratory no-choice assay. We also tested its preference for juvenile slugs and the similarly-sized pillbugs (Armadillidium vulgare), under choice conditions. This beetle preyed upon both eggs and juvenile slugs, with the highest consumption rate on 20 mg body mass individuals. While preferring the pillbug during the first 24 h of the choice test, our results suggest that in field conditions, S. anthracinus might be a natural enemy of D. reticulatum, consuming slug eggs and juveniles of different body mass.
