5|$|In Mitch Hawker's {{worldwide}} Best Roller Coaster Poll, the two {{tracks are}} ranked separately. In every {{year that the}} steel roller coaster poll has been held, Chinese Fireball has ranked higher than the Hungarian <b>Horntail.</b> In 1999, Chinese Fireball and Hungarian <b>Horntail</b> peaked at positions 9 and 18, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Challenge (known as Dueling Dragons from 1999 to 2010) {{was a pair}} of intertwined, {{inverted}} {{roller coasters}} in the Wizarding World of Harry Potter area of Universal Studios' Islands of Adventure in Orlando, Florida, United States. The ride was themed to two chasing dragons, one side being Chinese Fireball and the other Hungarian <b>Horntail.</b> It featured a layout in which the two trains shared adjacent lift hills but traversed two unique courses. The ride was designed by Bolliger & Mabillard of Switzerland. The Chinese Fireball dragon reached a top speed of 60mph, and the Hungarian <b>Horntail</b> dragon reached a top speed of 55mph. Both versions featured five inversions and a total ride time of two minutes and 25 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Dragon Challenge {{operated}} {{with several}} steel and fiberglass trains. Each train had eight cars with four seats {{for a total}} of 32 riders per train. The trains front seat gave a mouth resemblance while the rest gave off resemblance to hands. All the Hungarian <b>Horntail</b> trains resembled a blue ice dragon while all the Chinese Fireball trains resembled a red fire dragon.|$|E

5|$|In May 2007, Universal {{announced}} plans to construct The Wizarding World of Harry Potter, a new section devoted to the popular Harry Potter book and film series. Dueling Dragons, {{as well as the}} adjacent Flight of the Hippogriff roller coaster, were shown {{to be included in the}} new section. Universal later announced that the attraction would be renamed Dragon Challenge upon the re-opening of the attraction and that the two roller coasters would be renamed as Hungarian <b>Horntail</b> and Chinese Fireball.|$|E
25|$|The {{world premiere}} of the film took place in London, England on 6 November 2005. One of the {{features}} of the premiere was an animatronic, fire-breathing Hungarian <b>Horntail.</b> The 40-foot-long dragon, used during the scene where Hagrid leads Harry into the forest a night before the first task, was designed and built by the film's special effects supervisor John Richardson and creature effects & makeup supervisor Nick Dudman.|$|E
500|$|When the coaster cars duelled, {{in order}} to make the trains meet at each of the three {{near-miss}} points along the layout, the trains would be weighed once they were loaded at the station to adjust the dispatch times. (For example, if the Chinese Fireball train weighed more than the Hungarian <b>Horntail</b> train, the Fireball would be dispatched after the <b>Horntail.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Sirex is a genus of wasps in {{the family}} Siricidae, the <b>horntails</b> or wood wasps. They inject eggs with fungal endosymbionts into wood. The fungus is {{contained}} in a mycangium which nourishes it with secretions, and in turn it digests wood for the wasp larva.|$|R
25|$|Species in {{the genus}} Echinodontium have a hydnaceous (with spinelike protuberances) hymenial surface, dimitic hyphal system, smooth basidiospores, and {{in three of}} four species, a {{symbiotic}} association with <b>horntails</b> — Sirex and Urocerus species. The insects eat the fungus and help disperse the species by inoculating the wood of the host tree with either hyphal fragments or spores when they lay their eggs.|$|R
2500|$|The album {{contains}} various Christmas songs, some {{brand new}} and others previously released. [...] "Yule Ball 2005 Cassette" [...] and [...] "Yule Ball 2006 Cassette" [...] are each complete {{collections of the}} three songs released at the 2005 and the 2006 Yule Balls.

5|$|The Ichneumonidae are {{specialized}} parasitoids, {{often of}} Lepidoptera larvae deeply buried in plant tissues, {{which may be}} woody. For this purpose, they have exceptionally long ovipositors; they detect their hosts by smell and vibration. Some of the largest species, including Rhyssa persuasoria and Megarhyssa macrurus, parasitise <b>horntails,</b> large sawflies whose adult females also have impressively long ovipositors. Some parasitic species have a mutualistic relationship with a polydnavirus that weakens the host's immune system and replicates in the oviduct of the female wasp.|$|R
50|$|The {{suborder}} Symphyta {{includes the}} sawflies, <b>horntails,</b> and parasitic wood wasps. The group may be paraphyletic, {{as it has}} been suggested that the family Orussidae may be the group from which the Apocrita arose. They have an unconstricted junction between the thorax and abdomen. The larvae are herbivorous, free-living eruciforms, with three pairs of true legs, prolegs (on every segment, unlike Lepidoptera) and ocelli. The prolegs do not have crochet hooks at the ends unlike the larvae of the Lepidoptera.|$|R

500|$|When first {{entering}} the queue, guests were taken past {{a number of}} banners for the Triwizard Tournament showing support for the four contestants. After passing the Weasleys' crashed flying Ford Anglia, they entered the Champions' Tent. From there, guests passed a large pedestal with the Triwizard Cup glowing at the top, and several dark [...] "tunnels" [...] which lead to both coaster's stations. Just before {{entering the}} station, guests had to choose which coaster they want to ride: Chinese Fireball {{to the left or}} Hungarian <b>Horntail</b> to the right. Once in the station, on the ceiling, there was a projection of the dragons.|$|E
500|$|Harry Potter and the Forbidden Journey {{is a new}} {{attraction}} {{inside the}} replica of Hogwarts Castle, simulating {{a tour of the}} castle and its surrounding grounds. Visitors initially walk through the castle, interacting with various characters and props from the Potter series, including a speech from Dumbledore, and directions from Harry, Hermione and Ron, before boarding a [...] "magical bench" [...] (controlled with a KUKA robotic arm system). Throughout the ride, guests are taken around the outside of the castle, using a combination of simulated flight as well as encountering realistic animatronic versions of the Whomping Willow, a horde of dementors, giant spiders, the Hungarian <b>Horntail</b> Dragon, and a Quidditch match.|$|E
500|$|Hagrid reveals to Harry {{that the}} first task {{involves}} dragons, and since Fleur and Krum's headmasters are also aware of this, and will surely tell them in advance, Harry informs Cedric as well. At the task, Harry has to pass a Hungarian <b>Horntail</b> to retrieve a golden egg that contains a hint to the next task, which he does by summoning his Firebolt broomstick with the Accio spell, and finishes the task tied for first with Krum. Ron and Harry subsequently reconcile, Ron now understanding the full danger of the tournament. When Harry opens the egg, though, it merely shrieks loudly. Hermione then takes Harry and Ron to the school kitchens, where house elves work. There, they meet a distraught Winky, who is struggling {{to get over the}} loss of her sacking. They also meet Harry's old friend Dobby, who has been employed at Hogwarts to work in the kitchens; he is the only known house elf to appreciate his freedom, despite his hardworking nature.|$|E
50|$|We Are Wizards is a feature-length {{documentary}} by Josh Koury {{about the}} Harry Potter fandom. It features Wizard rock bands Harry and the Potters, Draco and the Malfoys, The Hungarian <b>Horntails,</b> and The Whomping Willows. The film also features Heather Lawver, Melissa Anelli, and Brad Neely. We Are Wizards had its World Premiere at the SXSW film festival in 2008, then traveled to 20 film festivals worldwide.

50|$|The term mycangium (pl., mycangia)(Chinese：贮菌器) is used {{in biology}} for special {{structures}} {{on the body of}} an animal that are adapted for the transport of symbiotic fungi (usually in spore form). This is seen in many xylophagous insects (e.g. <b>horntails</b> and bark beetles), which apparently derive much of their nutrition from the digestion of various fungi that are growing amidst the wood fibers. In some cases, as in ambrosia beetles (Coleoptera: Curculionidae: Scolytinae and Platypodinae), the fungi are the sole food, and the excavations in the wood are simply to make a suitable microenvironment for the fungus to grow. In other cases (e.g., the southern pine beetle, Dendroctonus frontalis), wood tissue is the main food, and fungi weaken the defense response from the host plant.|$|R
40|$|The family Siricidae {{has more}} than 100 species in about 11 genera. Nearly all species are native to the Northern Hemisphere {{although}} there is an endemic genus (Afrotremex) in southern Africa. Collectively they are known as woodwasps or <b>horntails.</b> All siricids are wood borers and several species are forestry pests to varying degrees. New Zealand has a single species of siricid woodwasp, Sirex noctilio F., {{thought to have been}} accidentally introduced around 1900. Two recent and noteworthy siricid incursions are presented as case studies, with an emphasis on the science used in decision support. The first case study describes the advantages of using morphological and molecular diagnostic approaches in combination. This case resulted in the first published host record association between S. noctilio and Amylostereum areolatum (Chaillet ex Fr.) Boidin in Cedrus atlantica (Endl.) Manetti. The second case study reports the application of published life cycle developmental data to assess establishment risk, and profiles the entry of Sirex juvencus (L.) into New Zealand within timber stamped with the International Standards for Phytosanitary Measures (ISPM) 15 mark, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry Biosecurity New Zealand’s actions to mitigate this high-risk pathway. Historical records of siricid interceptions at New Zealand’s border are examined and discussed, in relation to patterns of interception records over time and the key species intercepted...|$|R
500|$|The ride {{begins with}} a dousing of Floo Powder from Hermione Granger, who asks the guests to say, [...] "Observatory" [...] in order to {{transport}} them to their desired location, and the enchanted bench flies off through the Floo Network to the Astronomy Tower. The guests leave the room of requirement through its fireplace and enter the Observatory, where they look out through the open arches to the hills and lake outside Hogwarts' boundary. As the guests fly {{out of one of}} the Observatory's arches, the ride smoothly switches to a wrap-around projection screen and they follow Harry Potter and Ron Weasley around Hogwarts' buildings and towers to a Quidditch match. As Harry and Ron travel under a bridge, Hagrid yields the riders and asks them if they have seen a dragon. As Harry redirects the riders' attentions back to their journey, Hagrid's pet Hungarian <b>Horntail</b> dragon begins to chase the riders. The bench flies out of the projection screen and into a set of the uneven bridge that crosses the valley behind Hogwarts and, after falling out of a hole in the floor of the bridge, they encounter an animatronic dragon, which breaths pressurized water mist with red lighting pointed to it to make it resemble fire.|$|E
500|$|Upon {{departing from}} the station, the train made a slight left turn {{leading into the}} {{transfer}} track section before beginning to climb the [...] lift hill. Once {{at the top and}} after going through a pre-drop, the train made a sharp [...] left-hand drop back to the ground. Then, the train goes back up, through an Immelmann followed by a slight downward right turn before entering an air-time hill (this was the first of three near-miss points with the Hungarian <b>Horntail</b> train when the roller coasters duelled). Next, the train dropped back down turning left slightly leading into a second Immelmann. After a downward right helix and a short section of straight track, the train goes through the second former near-miss point with the other train, a vertical loop. After the loop and another section of straight track, the train made a right turn leading into the third and final former near-miss element which was a corkscrew. Then, the train made a left turn followed by a small drop leading into another section of straight track before entering the final element in the coaster layout, another corkscrew. The train then made a left turn into the final brake run. Following a left turn, the train returned to the station where riders unloaded and the next riders load.|$|E
2500|$|Xeris {{spectrum}} {{is a kind}} of [...] <b>horntail</b> or wood wasp, that lives in coniferous forests. It is large wasp with a powerful ovipositor in females. Unlike other Siricid Wood wasps, Xeris spectrum does not have symbiotic fungi to aid its larvae as they burrow in the wood of fir and other conifer trees making it unique in the Siricidae. It is widespread and is found in large parts of Europe, Asia, Africa and North America.|$|E
500|$|By 2007, Harry and the Potters {{and their}} {{unexpected}} fan based indie music genre of wizard rock have grown {{into an international}} phenomenon. Recently, the band has engaged in charity side-projects and activism within the Harry Potter community. In January 2007, Harry and the Potters created the Wizard Rock EP of the Month Club, a mail order subscription club that released an extended play by a different wizard rock band each month. Reflecting wizard rock's literacy focus, the club raises funds for First Book, a non-profit organization that gives children {{the ability to read}} and own their first new books. In 2007, the Club raised over $13,000 for the organization. They released their first extended play The Enchanted Ceiling in 2007. May 2007 was also the beginning of their large 70-show summer-library tour across the US and Canada called simply [...] "Summer Tour 2007". Like their initial year in 2003, the summer of 2007 would see the release of another Harry Potter book. Harry and the Potters scheduled the mid-point of the tour to arrive back in their home state and celebrate the July 21 midnight release of the seventh book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows at Harvard Yard. The festivities became an excuse for a meet-up of a number of wizard rock bands including The Hungarian <b>Horntails</b> and their nemesis Draco and the Malfoys which all played to a large crowd of Harry Potter fans in the Cambridge, Massachusetts college venue. Harry and the Potters resumed their tour which finally wound-up in late August. In Vancouver on July 7, 2007, hundreds of people crowded outside the Vancouver Public Library to see Harry and the Potters. ABC News reported that the band usually charge $5 to $10 for tickets to their shows, though some performances are free. Harry and the Potters said 600 people turned out for a recent show, July 10, 2007, in Portland, Oregon.|$|R
2500|$|The book {{features}} doodles {{and comments}} added by Ron Weasley. The comments {{would appear to}} have been written {{around the time of the}} fourth book, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. These doodles add some extra information for fans of the series (for example the [...] "Acromantula" [...] entry has a comment confirming that Hogwarts is located in Scotland) along with comic relief (such as Ron saying [...] "you're not kidding" [...] when talking about the Hungarian <b>Horntail</b> being the most fearsome dragon of all, a reference to Harry's encounter with one in the fourth book).|$|E
2500|$|As in the {{previous}} instalments, Stuart Craig and Stephenie McMillan provided the film's art and set designs, respectively. Due to the film's scope, there were many new sets and transformations of old sets created. McMillan was most excited about redesigning the Great Hall for the scenes involving the Yule Ball. [...] "Originally we thought silver curtains, silver table cloths and an ice dance floor," [...] said McMillan, [...] "but it just went on and on. The drapes man eventually said, 'Why not just stick the fabrics on the wall?'" [...] Each task of the Triwizard Tournament required massive sets. The rock quarry set for the first task, where Harry faces off with the Hungarian <b>Horntail,</b> was built in two sections at Leavesden Studios. Craig called it [...] "one of the biggest sets we've ever built {{for any of the}} films." [...] For the second task, involving the film's underwater scenes, the film crew designed and built a blue screen tank holding [...] "about half a million gallons of water." [...] As for the final task, which took place in the maze, hedge walls ranging from 20 to 40 feet tall were constructed and enhanced with computer-generated imagery.|$|E
2500|$|In From Homer to Harry Potter: A Handbook on Myth and Fantasy, Matthew Dickerson and David O'Hara {{argue that}} the Beowulf poet added {{the figure of the}} dragon to [...] "the pot...that is ladeled out of by most modern fantasy writers"; they argued that both {{numerous}} works with villainous dragons, as well as literature with benign dragons like the My Father's Dragon books and the Pern series by Anne McCaffrey, were influenced by Beowulfs dragon. Dickerson and O'Hara further elaborated that through its dragon, Beowulf turned the [...] "notion of having a monstrous evil (and not mere human foes) as the enemy" [...] into [...] "a hallmark of modern fantasy" [...] present in C. S. Lewis' Narnia books, Ursula K. Le Guin's Earthsea books, and the Thomas Covenant series by Stephen Donaldson. J. R. R. Tolkien used the dragon story of Beowulf as a template for Smaug of The Hobbit; in each case, the dragon awakens upon the hoard being disturbed by one stealing a chalice and goes into a wrathful rampage until slain by another person. Aia Hussein of the National Endowment for the Humanities has written that the fight between Harry Potter and the Hungarian <b>Horntail</b> in Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000) by J. K. Rowling was influenced by the confrontation between the dragon and the title character in Beowulf. James Parker of The Atlantic saw similarities between the dragon in Beowulf and the dragons in Game of Thrones (2011-present).|$|E

50|$|Megarhyssa nortoni is a predatory insect. Its larvae are parasitoids of <b>horntail</b> wasp larvae in {{coniferous}} trees. The adult female hunts <b>horntail</b> larvae for egg placement. It smells wood-eating fungus, {{utilized by}} the <b>horntail</b> larvae to predigest wood pulp, and uses its antennae to detect vibrations {{made by the}} <b>horntail</b> larvae. The female M. nortoni curls its ovipositor over its abdomen to insert {{the tip of the}} ovipositor at a right angle into the bark and cuts into the tree until it reaches the <b>horntail</b> larval tunnel. The female then deposits a very slender egg through its ovipositor into the tunnel on or near the <b>horntail</b> larva. The M. nortoni larva then hatches to eat the live <b>horntail</b> larval host from the inside causing the <b>horntail</b> larva's eventual death. The M. nortoni larva pupates inside its host and emerges the following summer as an adult.|$|E
