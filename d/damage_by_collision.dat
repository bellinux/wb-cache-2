50|$|The {{bridge was}} <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>collisions</b> {{on at least}} three occasions. In 1899, gales drove a sailing ship {{against one of the}} piers. In October 1904, a {{schooner}} also collided with one of the piers as it passed through the swing span, displacing some girders. Rail traffic was suspended until June 1905. In August 1920, a German warship, surrendered {{at the end of the}} First World War, broke free from its moorings and crashed into the bridge. The damage was serious enough to close the bridge to rail traffic until March 1921. As a result of these incidents, three stone piers were replaced by cast iron ones and additional cross-bracing was added to all piers.|$|R

25|$|The Corolla Axio {{introduced}} a Pre-Crash Safety System that uses millimeter-wave radar.

40|$|Abstract. Composite {{material}} is very attractive for structural applications {{due to its}} in-herent mechanical properties and low weight. The improvement in manufacture process allow composite materials be used even as primary structures in modern aircraft design such as Boeing 787 without loss of airworthiness. During service life composite structures can be <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>collisions,</b> dropping tools during assembly or maintenance, etc. Several impact studies were conducted for plates, but few regards curved geometries or cylinders. This study presents a progressive damage analysis of low energy impact on carbon fiber filament wind-ing cylinders. Three different layups were used for experimental tests. A new material model based in continuum damage mechanics were implemented as a FORTRAN subroutine linked to finite element software ABAQUS for explicit dynamic analysis (VUMAT). Good correla-tions for force vs. time and displacement vs. time between the numerical model experimental test results were obtained...|$|R

Five crew members of both the Arkendale H and Wastdale H died in the accident. More recently the river flooded during the 2007 United Kingdom floods.|$|R
5|$|In addition, {{the game}} {{features}} {{a variety of}} weapons which can be utilised to destroy other opponents or for self-defence. Offensive weapons include rockets, plasma bolts, missiles, and grenades, whilst defensive weapons range from deployable mines to energy shields.

If a shield runs out, the ship will explode and the player in question will be eliminated from the race.|$|R
50|$|The Highways Department {{inspected}} {{the bridge and}} found that only the inspection platform rails were <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> the <b>collision,</b> and that the structural integrity of the bridge was not jeopardised. In the days following the incident there were calls in local media {{for the government to}} build a second link to the airport. In fact, such a link is already under construction: the Tuen Mun-Chek Lap Kok Link is a road tunnel being built as part of the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge project.|$|R
40|$|The Canadian Wildlife Service has had {{twenty-five years}} {{experience}} with the problem caused by bird contacts with aircraft. I experienced my first bird strike, while flying as an observer on a waterfowl survey in August, 1940. Officers of the Service investigated bird problems at airports at Yarmouth, Nova Scotia, and Cartierville, Quebec, in the late 19402 ̆ 7 s. Those incidents involving gulls and low speed piston-engined aircraft caused minor damage to the aircraft but considerable disturbance to the operators. As aircraft speeds increased and airports became more numerous and busier the problem increased in extent and complexity. By 1960 {{it was apparent that}} the problem would grow worse and that work should be directed toward reducing the number of incidents. In 1960 an electra aircraft crashed at Boston, Massachusetts, killing 61 passengers. Starlings were involved in the engine malfunction which preceded the crash. In November, 1962 a viscount aircraft was <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>collision</b> with two swans between Baltimore and Washington and crashed with a loss of 17 lives. Those incidents focused attention on the bird hazard problem in the United States...|$|R
5000|$|Eagle 56 {{was one of}} 60 [...] {{built by}} Henry Ford late in World War I as {{submarine}} chasers, none of which saw action. Unpopular due to their poor sea handling, only eight remained in service {{at the time of}} World War II. Eagle 56 was patrolling off the Delaware Capes in January 1942. Eagle 56 remained almost constantly at sea during the Second Happy Time of the Battle of the Atlantic, during which Axis submarines attacked merchant shipping along the east coast of North America. When her depth charges were expended, a small ship from Cape May, New Jersey would bring out a new supply. Eagle 56 rescued survivors of [...] off Cape May in February. Eagle 56 was <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> <b>collision</b> with the submerged wreck of Gypsum Prince while rescuing survivors from the British freighter which had collided with the British tanker Voco on 4 March at the entrance to Delaware Bay. Eagle 56 was repaired using parts from another Eagle boat, and then assigned to the Key West sonar school in May 1942.|$|R
30|$|Since {{the doors}} {{have been handled}} daily, when opening and closing the shops, the decorations were in a {{critical}} condition due to several <b>damages</b> caused <b>by</b> <b>collisions</b> with store fixtures. In addition, the mechanical parts of the folding doors were worn out in {{such a degree that}} any conservation treatment would have been unaffordable. It was therefore decided that new doors had to be recreated and that the original doors should be stored at Museum of Art in Public Spaces and the paint used by Gernes should be investigated. Samples representing each colour were therefore taken for pigment analysis.|$|R
50|$|Following her fiasco, Valencia {{was sold}} to the Pacific Coast Steamship Company.

It was later discovered that had Valencia been <b>damaged</b> underwater <b>by</b> the <b>collision,</b> she would have foundered.|$|R
50|$|The tram car may {{be damaged}} during {{derailment}} or collision with other vehicles or pedestrians. Tram derailments are often caused <b>by</b> <b>damaged</b> track, <b>collisions</b> with obstacles, junction failures, or excessive speed at a junction or curve.

50|$|Because of {{the loss}} of {{electric}} power, the crew had to wait until daylight to fully assess the damage to their ship. First light brought a thick fog. The Borie was too badly <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> the <b>collision</b> to reach the rendezvous in time, or even be towed to port by her sister ships. She had sustained severe underwater damage along her entire port side, including both engine rooms, as the two ships were pounded together by the sea before separating. The stress of the wave action from the 15-foot waves, as the Borie was pinned against the U-boat's hull, had caused damage to key operating systems throughout the ship.|$|R
50|$|Clark {{decided to}} trap Sheridan's forces with {{advanced}} model destroyers {{which had been}} fitted with Shadow technology. When Sheridan's second in command, Commander Susan Ivanova, learned of this, she engaged the destroyers with the White Star ships, leaving {{the rest of the}} Earthforce vessels behind. Captain James of the EAS Agamemnon opposed Ivanova's decision, but soon realized that Clark would have his destroyers target the Earth ships rather than the White Stars. While Ivanova managed to destroy all the vessels, her White Star was severely <b>damaged</b> <b>by</b> a <b>collision</b> with debris from one of the destroyed vessels and she was injured and left in a near-death state.|$|R
