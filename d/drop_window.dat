40|$|Introduction: Constructing or renovating a {{laboratory}} {{can be both}} challenging and rewarding. UAB Cytology (UAB CY) recently undertook a project to relocate from a building constructed in 1928 to new space. UAB CY {{is part of an}} academic center that provides service to a large set of patients, support training of one cytotechnology program and one cytopathology fellowship training program and involve actively in research and scholarly activity. Our objectives were to provide a safe, aesthetically pleasing space and gain efficiencies through lean processes. Methods: The phases of any laboratory design project are Planning, Schematic Design (SD), Design Development (DD), Construction Documents (CD) and Construction. Lab personnel are most critical in the Planning phase. During this time stakeholders, relationships, budget, square footage and equipment were identified. Equipment lists, including what would be relocated, purchased new and projected for future growth ensure that utilities were matched to expected need. A chemical inventory was prepared and adequate storage space was planned. Regulatory and safety requirements were discussed. Tours and high level process flow diagrams helped architects and engineers understand the laboratory daily work. Future needs were addressed through a questionnaire which identified potential areas of growth and technological change. Throughout the project, decisions were driven by data from the planning phase. During the SD phase, objective information from the first phase was used by architects and planners to create a general floor plan. This was the basis of a series of meetings to brainstorm and suggest modifications. DD brings more detail to the plans with engineering, casework, equipment specifics, finishes. Design changes should be completed at this phase. The next phase, CD took the project from the lab purview into purely technical mode. Construction documents were used by the contractor for the bidding process and ultimately the Construction phase. Results: The project fitted out a total of 9, 000 square feet; 4, 000 laboratory and 5, 000 office/support. Lab space includes areas for Prep, CT screening, sign out and Imaging. Adjacent space houses faculty offices and conferencing facilities. Transportation time was reduced (waste removal) by a Pneumatic Tube System, specimen <b>drop</b> <b>window</b> to Prep Lab and a pass thru window to the screening area. Open screening and prep areas allow visual management control. Efficiencies were gained by ergonomically placing CT Manual and Imaging microscopes and computers in close proximity, also facilitating a paperless workflow for additional savings. Logistically, closer proximity to Surgical Pathology maximized the natural synergies between the areas. Conclusions: Lab construction should be a systematic process based on sound principles for safety, high quality testing, and finance. Our detailed planning and design process can be a model for others undertaking similar project...|$|E
40|$|The ever {{increasing}} demand for bandwidth, {{led to the}} introduction of wavelength division multiplexing (WDM) as one technique to increase capacity in the optical fibre networks. Initially 100 GHz was set as the standard channel separation by the ITU, but this spacing is due to capacity constraints, already being reduced to 50 GHz to accommodate extra data-traffic. Even 25 GHz channel separations are currently being discussed and may very well become the trend of the future on the moderate bit-rate of 10 Gbit/s, as an alternative to faster bit-rates whilst faster electronics is maturing. This trend therefore calls for filters that can perform filtering duties, that on top of a solid functionality, also act as passive ultra-selective filters that can maintain channel integrity at any cost. The technology of Fibre Bragg gratings {{has come a long way}} since the initial demonstrations in 1978 by Hill et al. at the CRC in Canada. Bragg gratings and in particular apodised Bragg gratings has previously been shown to exhibit near ideal characteristics for compact and high filling factor values on grid spacings as small as 25 GHz [1]. However, it has also been discussed how these filters, despite their near ideal spectral performance, suffer from non-linear phase attributes in the stop-band, that could limit their use in high bit-rate systems (10 Gbit/s and above) [2]. Linear-phase filters therefore have been proposed as a solution to this problem, but some previous demonstrations have suffered from low rejection values [2]. In this talk we show linear-phase (dispersion-less) Bragg grating square-filters for 25 GHz and 50 GHz channel separations that exhibit grid filling-factor values of 75 % and constant reflectivities in excess of 99. 9 % (> 30 dB transmission loss) over the full <b>drop</b> <b>window.</b> The linear phase and square spectral performance of the gratings are obtained by imposing a slowly varying envelope function (superstructure) (Fig. 1) on the rapidly varying refractive index modulation forming the Bragg grating. This envelope function is generated using apodisation and is imposed during writing using a grating manufacturing technique where full control of all vital grating parameters is available. A recently developed inverse scattering algorithm is used for the design of the envelope function [3]. The manufactured filters are tested at 10 Gbit/s NRZ and show that < 10 ^- 11 bit-error-rate (BER) is obtained for constant received power throughout the useful band (Fig. 2). Additionally, we will discuss the importance of these filters for dispersion-free filtering at high bit-rates, by comparing their performance with "traditionally" apodised Bragg grating filters. It will be demonstrated how this new family of gratings out-performs the standard apodised Bragg gratings for their linear-phase characteristics and that they allow for tuning and drift of the transmitter over the full bandwidth of the grating without being affected by dispersion at any point in the stopband...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Explicit Congestion Notification (ECN) is a newer {{method for}} {{congestion}} control in TCP IP networks. Network Simulator 2 (NS 2) software {{has been used}} to compare the performance of ECN packet marking to other older and newer congestion control schemes, such as DropTail and Random Early Detection (RED), in both LAN and WAN schemes. During the simulations different parameters including proportion of packet <b>drops,</b> <b>window</b> size variation, queue size, and throughput were measured to evaluate the performance. The overall objective was to independently and comparatively study ECN {{in a wide range of}} situations to better understand its advantages and disadvantages.

50|$|In October 1955 a {{facelift}} {{model with}} deeper {{front and rear}} screens was introduced. The balanced <b>drop</b> <b>windows</b> were replaced by ones with proper winding mechanisms, there were interior trim improvements, separate amber rear flasher lights and windscreen washers became standard.

This model was assembled in New Zealand, alongside the Wyvern and Velox, with 840 being built in 1956, according to a local owners' group with access to copies of the GM Petone plant ledgers. More changes were made in October 1956, with a new grille with horizontal bars, higher compression ratio engine, electrically operated windscreen wipers (replacing the camshaft driven system) and changes to the body trim and two tone colour scheme.
