50|$|Residing in an <b>enclave</b> within {{another country}} has often {{involved}} difficulties {{in such areas}} as passage rights, importing goods, currency, provision of utilities and health services, and host nation cooperation. Thus, over time <b>enclaves</b> have tended to be eliminated.

25|$|The Khasansky District lies {{near the}} Sino-North Korean border and the Sino-Russian border and {{included}} two disputed regions along the Tumen River. According to the agreement, 3km² (1mi²) of territory would {{be transferred to}} China, and Chinese ships would gain the right to navigate the Tumen river. The territory transfer would connect a previously <b>enclaved</b> piece of Chinese territory {{to the rest of}} China (Fangchuancun). This portion of the agreement stirred up some controversy among some Russian officials from Primorsky Krai, as they felt that direct Chinese access to the Sea of Japan (through the Tumen River) would decrease the economic importance of Vladivostok and Nakhodka. Other arguments protested at potential pollution from Chinese economic development, the possibility of Chinese military vessels navigating the river, and the presence of a Russian cemetery commemorating the Lake Khasan Incident in the area. Finally, in June 1997, the Russian side proposed a resolution which would divide the disputed territory in half. This was accepted by China in September of the same year, and in November, when the border demarcation work was declared finished, 1.6km² (0.6mi²) were transferred to China, and 1.4km² (0.5mi²) were retained by Russia. The Lake Khasan cemetery remained on the Russian side, and the Chinese officials underwent informal agreements to not build a port along the Tumen River.|$|E

40|$|This PhD {{strives to}} {{understand}} what roles politico-spatial-legality play in shaping everyday life in the <b>enclaves</b> located in the northwest borderland curve in the India-Bangladesh border. Conceptually and legally, an <b>enclave</b> is a fragmented territory of one sovereign power located inside another sovereign territory. Following the decolonisation process in 1947, both India and Pakistan/Bangladesh inherited more than 200 <b>enclaves.</b> By investigating an everyday geography of the politico-spatial-legality in Indian and Bangladeshi <b>enclaves,</b> {{the aim of this}} thesis is to understand how the long existence of these <b>enclaves</b> shape their residents’ everyday lives. This thesis examines four research questions – i) how do the politico-spatial-legal factors shape citizenship in the <b>enclaves?</b> ii) What role(s) do boundaries perform in everyday life in the <b>enclaves?</b> iii) What are the (il) legal-political vulnerabilities present in the <b>enclaves?</b> And iv) What are the (il) legal survival methods adopted by the <b>enclave</b> residents’? The whole research is based on a seven-month ethnographic account in six <b>enclaves</b> and short visits (one day in each <b>enclave)</b> to another twenty <b>enclaves</b> during the pilot study in India and Bangladesh. The field sites were selected based on <b>enclave</b> size, distance from the border, practice of religion and relationship with the concerned states. The ethnography involved observing mundane events at different periods of time in different segments of the <b>enclaves</b> and nearby borderlands, and participating in local gathering in tea stalls, women’s evening socialisation and other social events. 55 in-depth interviews with the <b>enclave</b> residents and 10 interviews with the state officials were conducted for a detailed understanding of personal experiences and negotiations, and state perspectives on the <b>enclave</b> matter respectively. The thesis reveals that the <b>enclave</b> residents live in a non citizenship status, and the border is experienced in myriad ways in the <b>enclaves</b> constituting politico-juridical, social and gendered forms of bare life. On the other hand, the <b>enclave</b> dwellers find ways of attempting to cope with such circumstances and try to survive and advance their life through the loopholes of the state-system. The approach adopted in this thesis to study <b>enclaves</b> through the framework of politico-spatial-legality interactions is expected to advance <b>enclave</b> research. In addition, the thesis contributes to the academic literatures on citizenship and abandonment, border, bare life and rhythms of survival tactics. At policy level, the thesis can help policy makers understand ground vulnerabilities and difficult lives in the <b>enclaves</b> as there is very little government work available on <b>enclave</b> life. ...|$|R

40|$|Dark <b>enclaves</b> rich in {{amphibole}} and biotite are {{ubiquitous in}} granitoid rocks and generally thought to represent fragments of mafic magmas, cumulates or restites. However, magmatic assimilation of metamorphic or sedimentary country rock can also form dark <b>enclaves.</b> To develop criteria for identifying dark <b>enclaves</b> of non-magmatic origin, we investigated dark <b>enclaves</b> from a complete spectrum of light (carbonate- or feldspar-rich) to dark (amphibole-rich, biotite-rich, or composite) <b>enclaves,</b> reflecting progressive thermal and chemical equilibration with host tonalite from the Domenigoni Valley pluton in the Peninsular Ranges Batholith, California. Metasedimentary dark <b>enclaves</b> {{have a number}} of major and trace element characteristics that overlap those of literature-compiled igneous dark <b>enclaves.</b> Comparison to modeled igneous differentiation paths shows metasedimentary <b>enclaves</b> can have anomalous CaO and K 2 O contents for a given SiO 2, but other major element systematics may not deviate noticeably from igneous differentiation trends. In addition, {{the fact that there are}} literature-compiled mafic <b>enclaves</b> trending towards high K 2 O and high CaO suggests that not all mafic <b>enclaves</b> are of igneous origin.

[...] These objects are diverted from the commodity pathway to protect whatever value or symbolic power the object may transfer as a commodity.

[...] Appadurai postulates that the diversion of commodities from commodity pathways, whether for aesthetic or economic reasons, is always a sign of either creativity or crisis. For example, individuals facing economic hardships may sell family heirlooms to commoditize and profit from previously <b>enclaved</b> items. Similarly, warfare often commoditizes previously <b>enclaved</b> items as sacred relics are plundered and entered into foreign markets.|$|E

40|$|Thirty-eight new <b>enclaves</b> {{from the}} Vaca Muerta mesosiderite have been studied, and {{detailed}} SEM-petrography {{was carried out}} on fourteen of them. Three are coarse-grained gabbroic ilmenite-free <b>enclaves</b> consisting mainly of pigeonite (En_) and plagioclase, seven are fine- to medium-grained ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves</b> (En_) with ophitic to granular texture, and four are breccias. The most important breccias are diogenitic monomict breccias (En_) and an olivine-orthopyroxenite monomict breccia (Fo_). Reduction-induced orthopyroxene commonly surrounds pigeonite grains in the ilmenite-free <b>enclaves,</b> and occurs rarely in the marginal parts of the ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves.</b> Whitlockite forms from augite lamellae {{as a result of}} reduction, and the ilmenite-free <b>enclaves</b> have been enriched in P_ 2 O_ 5. Reduction of the ilmenite-free <b>enclaves</b> occurred in the parent body before mixing with Fe-Ni metal on the mesosiderite parent body. In the ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves</b> reduction occurred on the mesosiderite parent body after Fe-Ni metal was mixed in. Thus, two stages of subsolidus reduction occurred in <b>enclaves.</b> Ilmenite and rutile occur in the ilmenite-bearing and diogenitic <b>enclaves,</b> and various subsolidus reaction textures of chromite, ilmenite, rutile and probably preexisting pseudobrookite are found. Al_ 2 O_ 3 -depleted chromite formed through the decomposition of Cr_ 2 O_ 3 -bearing ilmenite and pseudobrookite. Zircon and baddeleyite were also found in the ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves,</b> and the latter is the first occurrence reported in mesosiderites. The ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves</b> always contain baddeleyite, whereas ZrO_ 2 -bearing phases are hardly ever found in HED meteorites. The bulk compositions of the <b>enclaves</b> were analyzed, and found to be more SiO_ 2 -enriched than the HED meteorites. Highly SiO_ 2 -enriched ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves</b> are especially common, and follow the Nuevo Laredo trend of the eucrites, whereas the other ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves</b> follow the Stannern trend. The highly SiO_ 2 -enriched <b>enclaves</b> probably formed by fractional crystallization, whereas the other ilmenite-bearing <b>enclaves</b> formed through partial melting. The existence of the highly SiO_ 2 -enriched <b>enclaves</b> may partly explain the SiO_ 2 -rich nature of mesosiderites, in addition to the in situ reduction process. Our observations suggest that the parent body and the parental magmas of the <b>enclaves</b> in the mesosiderites were initially {{different from those of the}} HED meteorites...|$|R

40|$|<b>Enclaves</b> {{are often}} {{incorrectly}} {{used to measure}} magmatic strains in plutons. We emphasize that microgranitoid <b>enclaves</b> are not like other ellipsoidal markers used to determine strain for the following reasons. (1) Adjacent <b>enclaves</b> may form at different times and different places and initially have non-spherical shapes with axial ratios up to 2. 7. (2) The final shapes and orientations of <b>enclaves</b> are a complex function of (a) initial shape and temperature of <b>enclaves,</b> (b) subtle changes in composition, melt percents, volatiles, grain sizes, and thus temporally variable viscosity contrasts between the <b>enclave</b> and magma, (c) a competition between strain and interfacial energies, and (d) deformation path, which may include internal strain and rigid rotations caused by magma flow during ascent, convection, expansion, chamber boundary processes, and tectonism. (3) <b>Enclaves</b> {{spend much of their}} time in magma as relatively rigid objects, and thus rigidly rotate and potentially break apart, rather than strain at matrix strain rates. (4) In some instances, <b>enclaves</b> do not record or track finite strain. Because of the above, final <b>enclave</b> populations are heterogeneous, and the use of single <b>enclaves</b> or <b>enclave</b> populations as strain markers violates many assumptions needed to complete strain analyses. On the other hand, a comparison of the preserved characteristics of igneous layering, mineral fabrics, and carefully evaluated <b>enclave</b> fabrics, including internal mineral alignment in <b>enclaves,</b> may provide qualitative data on the changing magnitude and kinematics of magmatic strains. 17 page(s...|$|R
