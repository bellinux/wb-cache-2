5000|$|As we {{previously}} stated, {{we recently}} {{became aware of}} allegations regarding an incident {{on the set of}} Bachelor in Paradise in Mexico. We take all such allegations seriously. The safety, security and well-being of the cast and crew <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>number</b> one concern, and we suspended filming so that the allegations could be investigated immediately and thoroughly. Our internal investigation, conducted with the assistance of an outside law firm, has now been completed. Out of respect for the privacy interests of those involved, we do not intend to release the videotape of the incident. We can say, however, that the tape does not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member. Nor does the tape show, contrary to many press reports, that the safety of any cast member was ever in jeopardy. Production on this season of Bachelor in Paradise will be resuming, and we plan to implement certain changes to the show’s policies and procedures to enhance and further ensure the safety and security of all participants.|$|E

Our employees are experiencing an increase in requests to assist, or participate, in projects with a multitude of cooperators. We are very eager to lend a helping hand, and often go {{out of our way}} to assist other programs and agencies. This commitment from our employees is well intended, however, as prudent managers, we must insure that our individual agency’s policy and regulations are maintained. The safety of everyone <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>number</b> one priority. The use of government vehicles, including aircraft, is a vital part of managing our resources. We have clear direction and policy on how we use aircraft to support our needs. At times, our employees are asked to participate in aviation operations that feature equipment and pilots that do not meet our minimum standards. Agency manuals and directives give us clear policy prohibiting our employees from riding in unapproved aircraft and/or with unapproved pilots. Occasionally senses of urgency to help others causes an employee to react by volunteering their time, or perform some service during off-duty hours. These employees have their heart in the right place, but can incur serious problems if they do not comply with agency guidelines and federal standards of ethical conduct. A common misconception of government employees is if they are in leave status, they are free to do anything they please. They mistakenly feel the regulations only apply while they are on duty and performing their normal duties. The rules still apply! Aviation i...|$|E

40|$|The first {{documented}} {{occurrence in}} Iowa was this year, although with these infestations {{it is clear}} that the weed was initially introduced to the state prior to 2013. It has been a serious problem in the south, and gained national notoriety after developing resistance to glyphosate and devastating the cotton industry in the Southeast. This paper will review why the weed has garnered such attention and access the threat it poses to Iowa. Identification Our heavy reliance on glyphosate has led to complacency in weed identification. However, the ability to identify Palmer amaranth is critical since Iowa is at the initial stages of invasion (Figure 1). The best way to minimize the impact of Palmer amaranth is to identify new infestations quickly and initiate steps to prevent its establishment and spread. Figure 1. Known infestations of Palmer amaranth (Dec. 2013). Palmer amaranth is one of several weedy pigweed (Amaranthus) species found across Iowa. Prior to the 1980 ’s redroot pigweed and smooth pigweed <b>were</b> <b>our</b> most common pigweed species, but since the late 1980 ’s, waterhemp has <b>been</b> <b>our</b> <b>number</b> one pigweed. Less common weedy pigweeds of Iowa fields include Powell amaranth and spiny pigweed. At casual glance there are many similarities among the weedy pigweeds, but knowledge of what specifically to look for simplifies differentiating Palmer amaranth from the other pigweeds...|$|R
