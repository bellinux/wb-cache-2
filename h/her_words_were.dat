500|$|On 25 October 1636, seven ministers {{gathered}} {{at the home of}} Cotton to confront the developing discord; they held a [...] "private conference" [...] which included Hutchinson and other lay leaders from the Boston church. Some agreement was reached, and Cotton [...] "gave satisfaction to them , so as he agreed with them all in the point of sanctification, and so did Mr. Wheelwright; so as they all did hold, that sanctification did help to evidence justification." [...] Another issue was that some of the ministers had heard that Hutchinson had criticised them during her conventicles for preaching a covenant of works and said that they were not able ministers of the New Testament. [...] Hutchinson responded to this only when prompted, and only to one or two ministers at a time. She believed that her response, which was largely coaxed from her, was private and confidential. [...] A year later, <b>her</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> used against her in a trial that resulted in her banishment from the colony.|$|E
500|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, she spoke the {{required}} words of repentance for political abuse of psychiatry which had had unprecedented dimensions in the Soviet Union for discrediting, intimidation and {{suppression of the}} human rights movement carried out primarily in this institution. <b>Her</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> widely broadcast abroad but were published only in the St. Petersburg newspaper Chas Pik within the country. However, in her 2001 book Aliyans Prava i Milosediya (The Alliance of Law and Mercy), Dmitrieva wrote that there were no psychiatric abuses and certainly no more than in Western countries. Moreover, the book makes the charge that professor Vladimir Serbsky and other intellectuals were wrong not to cooperate with the police department in preventing revolution and bloodsheds and that the current generation is wrong to oppose the regime. In 2007, Dmitrieva asserted that the practice of [...] "punitive psychiatry" [...] had been grossly exaggerated, while nothing wrong had been done by the Serbsky Institute. After that an official at the Serbsky Institute declared [...] "patient" [...] Vladimir Bukovsky, who was then going to run for the President of the Russian Federation, undoubtedly [...] "psychopathic".|$|E

2500|$|During a Party of Regions {{rally in}} Kiev {{to counter the}} ongoing Euromaidan protests, MP Olena Bondarenko called Tyahnybok a [...] "traitor" [...] and one [...] "who helps the Kremlin and Moscow." [...] <b>Her</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> altered to read on her party's website that he was instead a [...] "Nazi" [...] and that [...] "Nazis are not just disrespected, they are outlawed in Europe and {{throughout}} the civilized world".|$|E
2500|$|Her [...] "Prince Charming" [...] {{speech at}} the American Legions Girls State meeting in Austin in which she remarked: [...] "Prince Charming may be driving a Honda (motorcycle) and telling you you have no equal, but that's {{not going to do}} much good when you've got kids and a mortgage, and I could add he's got a beer gut and a {{wandering}} eye. Prince Charming, if he does ride up on a Honda, he's going to expect you to make the payments." [...] <b>Her</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> received as bitter and hostile against both sexes, and perceived as a negative view of marriage and family.|$|E
2500|$|According to Michael Lewis in Vanity Fair: [...] "Many of the {{articles}} attacking her accused her of making a very specific forecast — {{as many as a}} hundred defaults within a year! — that failed to materialize... But that's not at all what she had said: <b>her</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> being misrepresented so that her message might be more easily attacked. 'She was referring to the complacency of the ratings agencies and investment advisers who say there is nothing to worry about,' said a person at 60 Minutes who reviewed the transcripts of the interview for me, to make sure I had heard what I thought I had heard. She says there is something to worry about, and it will be apparent to everyone in the next 12 months." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{had her own}} way in {{everything}} now. In going and coming, in buying and selling, <b>her</b> <b>word</b> <b>was</b> law.|$|R

2500|$|In an {{interview}} with Blender magazine, Keys allegedly said [...] "'Gangsta rap' was a ploy to convince black people to kill each other, 'gangsta rap' didn't exist" [...] {{and went on to}} say that it was created by [...] "the government". The magazine also claimed she said that Tupac Shakur and The Notorious B.I.G. were [...] "essentially assassinated, their beefs stoked by the government and the media, to stop another great black leader from existing". Keys later wrote a statement clarifying the issues and saying <b>her</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> misinterpreted. Later that year, Keys was criticized by anti-smoking campaigners after billboard posters for her forthcoming concerts in Indonesia featured a logo for the A Mild cigarette brand sponsored by tobacco firm Philip Morris. She apologized after discovering that the concert was sponsored by the firm and asked for [...] "corrective actions". In response, the company withdrew its sponsorship.|$|E
2500|$|In December 2016, The New York Times {{reported}} that Russia (after years of denials) finally admitted that senior Russian officials carried {{out one of}} the biggest conspiracies in sports history — a far-reaching doping operation that implicated scores of Russian athletes and tainted not just the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi but also the entire Olympic movement. [...] It was confirmed that a lab director tampered with urine samples at the Olympics and provided cocktails of performance-enhancing drugs, corrupting some of the world’s most prestigious competitions. Members of the Federal Security Service (a successor to the K.G.B.) broke into sample bottles holding urine. In addition, a deputy sports minister for years ordered cover-ups of top athletes’ use of banned substances. [...] Anna Antseliovich, the acting director general of Russia’s national antidoping agency characterized Russia's cheating program as an [...] "institutional conspiracy.” She later confirmed that <b>her</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> [...] "taken out of context" [...] and [...] "distorted".|$|E
2500|$|During {{the first}} Iron Maiden song, {{several members of}} the front row of the crowd (reportedly a {{combination}} of Osbourne's entourage and a few members from other bands persuaded by Osbourne or her entourage) were reported to have bombarded the band with eggs, bottle caps, and ice. Some reports also say that Sharon's daughter, Kelly, was throwing objects at the band. During three of Iron Maiden's songs, the PA system was switched off, cutting power to Dickinson's microphone and the band's instruments. In audio captured during the concert, it is reported that Dickinson can be heard accusing the festival's organisers of deliberately cutting off the band's power. Also unknown to Iron Maiden, played secretly through the PA at the very beginning and end of their set was a tape with the chant [...] "Ozzy – Ozzy – Ozzy". On Iron Maiden's departure, Sharon made a few statements on stage in front of the 40,000 people in attendance. She told the audience that while she [...] "absolutely loved Iron Maiden," [...] she thought lead singer Bruce Dickinson was a [...] "prick" [...] and had [...] "disrespected Ozzfest since they began their stint with the tour." [...] <b>Her</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> met with booing, and soon afterwards she walked off the stage.|$|E

60|$|He {{had never}} seen his mother weep before. Her self-abandonment amazed him. <b>Her</b> <b>words</b> <b>were</b> {{distorted}} by her tears. It was the most terrible and distressing of crises....|$|E

60|$|She spoke English perfectly, {{but with}} a slight Scandinavian intonation, which seemed to soften the banality of <b>her</b> <b>words.</b> <b>Being</b> foreign, she thought less of concealing her sympathy, and was much less fearful of venturing on {{delicate}} ground.|$|R
60|$|He winced {{as though}} he had been struck, and looked at her with eyes {{momentarily}} wild. He felt that the deliberate cruelty of <b>her</b> <b>words</b> <b>was</b> of intent, an instinct of her brain, defying for the moment her heart.|$|R
