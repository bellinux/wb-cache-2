40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to expand the {{literature}} on Social StoryTM and in-situ training by targeting <b>household</b> <b>chemical</b> safety skills in typically developing young children. The study involved three children, ages 2 and 3 years old who had difficulty performing <b>household</b> <b>chemical</b> safety skills at home. A multiple-baseline across participants design with an ABC sequence was used to examine the effects of the Social StoryTM and in-situ training interventions on the children’s <b>household</b> <b>chemical</b> safety skills. The investigation focused on examining whether the Social StoryTM alone would be effective in teaching targeted safety skills to children or whether adding in-situ training would be necessary to enhance the treatment outcomes. The results indicated that Social StoryTM with in-situ training was more effective than Social StoryTM alone in teaching <b>household</b> <b>chemical</b> safety skills to children, ages 2 and 3 years old...|$|R

Groundwater pollution most often results from improper disposal of wastes on land.

25|$|Sweet {{orange oil}} is a {{by-product}} of the juice industry produced by pressing the peel.

Sweet orange oil consists of approximately 90% D-limonene, a solvent used in various <b>household</b> <b>chemicals,</b> such as wood conditioners for furniture and—along with other citrus oils—detergents and hand cleansers. It is an efficient cleaning agent with a pleasant smell, promoted for being environmentally friendly and therefore, preferable to petrochemicals. D-limonene is, however, classified from slightly toxic to humans, to very toxic to marine life in different countries.|$|E

The government's use of CS gas on women and children angered McVeigh; he had been exposed to the gas as part of his military training and was familiar with its effects.

25|$|More {{research}} is needed to fully define whether krokodil is a drug or a collection of symptoms associated with injecting toxic chemical by-products of home drug chemistry, but since desomorphine is one of hundreds of known opiates in a chemical family with no association to the symptoms, it is much more likely that the drug is a set of symptoms associated with the injection of <b>household</b> <b>chemicals,</b> rather than a specific drug itself. A comparison could be made to the effects of methanol poisoning from illicitly produced alcohol during the U.S. prohibition. Methanol was sometimes added to the distillate to enhance profits. Similarly, it is likely that krokodil is not a drug in itself, but rather, the symptoms of injecting toxic chemicals used in the process and not removed due to the crude process and lack of testing equipment.|$|E

40|$|Objective: To {{highlight}} {{the case of}} a sports-related alkali burn due to a common <b>household</b> <b>chemical</b> and emphasize the importance of a detailed medical history in chemical burns patients. Methods: A single-patient case study is presented along with references from existing literature.

Preventing groundwater pollution near potential sources such as landfills requires lining the bottom of a landfill with watertight materials, collecting any leachate with drains, and keeping rainwater off any potential contaminants, along with regular monitoring of nearby groundwater to verify that contaminants have not leaked into the groundwater.|$|E

Poisoned bait containing hydramethylnon or fipronil, and boric acid powder is effective on adults. Baits with egg killers are also quite effective at reducing the cockroach population. Alternatively, insecticides containing deltamethrin or pyrethrin are very effective. In Singapore and Malaysia, taxi drivers use pandan leaves to repel cockroaches in their vehicles.|$|E
500|$|The Joker has no {{inherent}} superhuman abilities. He commits crimes with {{a variety}} of weaponized thematic props such as a deck of razor-tipped playing cards, rolling marbles, Jack-in-the-boxes with unpleasant surprises and exploding cigars capable of leveling a building. The flower in his lapel sprays acid, and his hand often holds a lethal joy buzzer conducting a million volts of electricity, although both items were introduced in 1952 as harmless joke items. However, his chemical genius provides his most-notable weapon: Joker venom, a liquid or gaseous toxin which sends its targets into fits of uncontrollable laughter; higher doses can lead to paralysis, coma or death, leaving its victim with a ghoulish, pained rictus grin. The Joker has used venom since his debut; only he knows the formula, and is shown to be gifted enough to manufacture the toxin from ordinary <b>household</b> <b>chemicals.</b> Another version of the venom (used in [...] "Joker's Last Laugh") makes its victims resemble the Joker, susceptible to his orders.

For pharmaceuticals, the following substances have been identified as [...] "toxicologically relevant": substances with endocrine disrupting effects, genotoxic substances and substances that enhance the development of bacterial resistances. They mainly belong to the group of environmental persistent pharmaceutical pollutants. Techniques for elimination of micropollutants via a fourth treatment stage during sewage treatment are being tested in Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands. However, since those techniques are still costly, they are not yet applied on a regular basis. Such process steps mainly consist of activated carbon filters that adsorb the micropollutants. Ozone can also be applied as an oxidative method. Also the use of enzymes such as the enzyme laccase is under investigation. A new concept which could provide an energy-efficient treatment of micropollutants could be the use of laccase secreting fungi cultivated at a wastewater treatment plant to degrade micropollutants {{and at the same time}} to provide enzymes at a cathode of a microbial biofuel cells.
