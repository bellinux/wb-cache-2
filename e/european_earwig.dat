25|$|Forficula auricularia, {{the common}} earwig or <b>European</b> <b>earwig,</b> is an {{omnivorous}} insect {{in the family}} Forficulidae. The <b>European</b> <b>earwig</b> survives {{in a variety of}} environments and is a common household insect in North America. The name earwig comes from the appearance of the hindwings, which are unique and distinctive among insects, and resemble a human ear when unfolded; the species name of the common earwig, auricularia, is a specific reference to this feature. However, they are considered a pest because of the damage they do to crops, their frightening appearance, their ability to fly (which they rarely use), foul odor, and tendency to invade crevices in homes and consume pantry foodstuffs.|$|E
2500|$|<b>European</b> <b>earwigs</b> survive well in cool, moist {{habitats}} {{and have an}} optimum mean growth temperature of [...] Their daily abundance {{in a given year}} has been linked to factors such as temperature, wind velocity and the prevalence of easterly winds. The development of <b>European</b> <b>earwigs</b> also depends on temperature. Thus, the occurrence of <b>European</b> <b>earwigs</b> can be predicted based on weather parameters. Hibernating adults can tolerate cool temperatures, but their survival is reduced in poorly drained soils such as clay. To avoid excessive moisture, they seek the southern side of well drained slopes. Sometimes they also occupy the hollow stems of flowers where the soil is poorly drained. Their eggs are capable of resisting damage from cold and heat.|$|R
25|$|Native to Europe, western Asia and {{probably}} North Africa, Forficula auricularia {{was introduced to}} North America {{in the early twentieth}} century and is currently spread throughout much of the continent. In North America, <b>European</b> <b>earwigs</b> comprise two sibling species, which are reproductively isolated. Populations in cold continental climates mostly have one clutch per year, forming species A, whereas those in warmer climates have two clutches per year, forming species B. <b>European</b> <b>earwigs</b> are most commonly found in temperate climates, since they were originally discovered in the Palearctic region, and are most active when the daily temperature has minimal fluctuation.|$|R
25|$|<b>European</b> <b>earwigs</b> {{spend the}} day time in cool, dark, {{inaccessible}} places such as flowers, fruits, and wood crevices.

Often they consume plant matter, though they have also been known to feed on aphids, spiders, insect eggs, and dead plants and insects, among other things. Their favorite plants include the common crucifer Sisymbrium officinale, the white clover Trifolium repens, and the dahlia Dahlia variabilis. They also like to feed on molasses, {{as well as on}} nonvascular plants, lichens and algae. They prefer meat or sugar to natural plant material even though plants are a major natural food source. <b>European</b> <b>earwigs</b> prefer aphids to plant material such as leaves and fruit slices of apple, cherry and pear.

In the spring, she spreads them out into a single layer and the young emerge from the eggs. She guards them until they reach maturity after about one month. It is possible for the female to lay a second brood in one season and by the end of August all of the young reach maturity.|$|R

A complex synthetic blend (SB) of 30 candidate pheromone components, including benzoquinones, acids, hydroquinone, vanillin, aldehydes, ketones and an acetal significantly arrested females and nymphs in laboratory experiments. In both laboratory and field experiments, the SB lacking benzoquinones elicited significant behavioral responses from nymphs, but not from adults, suggesting that adults, unlike nymphs, use an aggregation pheromone with benzoquinones as constituent components.

5|$|Earwigs are {{regularly}} preyed upon by birds, {{and like many}} other insect species they are prey for insectivorous mammals, amphibians, lizards, centipedes, assassin bugs, and spiders. European naturalists have observed bats preying upon earwigs. Their primary insect predators are parasitic species of Tachinidae, or tachinid flies, whose larvae are endoparasites. One species of tachinid fly, Triarthria setipennis, has been demonstrated to be successful as a biological control of earwigs for almost a century. Another tachinid fly and parasite of earwigs, Ocytata pallipes, has shown promise as a biological control agent as well. The common predatory wasp, the yellow jacket (Vespula maculifrons), preys upon earwigs when abundant. A small species of roundworm, Mermis nigrescens, is known to occasionally parasitize earwigs that have consumed roundworm eggs with plant matter. At least 26 species of parasitic fungus from the order Laboulbeniales have been found on earwigs. The eggs and nymphs are also cannibalized by other earwigs. A species of tyroglyphoid mite, Histiostoma polypori (Histiostomatidae, Astigmata), are observed on common earwigs, sometimes in great densities; however, this mite feeds on earwig cadavers and not its live earwig transportation.

40|$|AbstractImperiled island foxes are {{inherently}} resource-limited by their insular ecology. We examined food use on all 6 islands where they occur to assess resource exploitation patterns.

40|$|Abstract The {{evolution}} of parental care and family group formation critically depends on offspring survival benefits and parental fecundity costs of care under given ecological conditions. Investigations of the functional significance of care in insect species that exhibit facultative parental care {{have been relatively}} rare but may be of particular interest for better understanding of benefit and cost schedules at an early evolutionary stage. In this study, aspects of benefits and costs of care were addressed in the sub-social <b>European</b> <b>earwig</b> (Forficula auricularia; Dermaptera: Forficulidae) by manipulating the presence of tending mothers and brood size in a fully crossed experimental design. Larvae growing in broods tended by their mother or of reduced size showed a higher survival probability than larvae growing in untended or large broods, as predicted if maternal care is beneficial and shaped by a trade-off between number and quality of offspring. Analysis of patterns of food consumption and developmental time further suggested that the benefit of maternal attendance is mediated by the maternal provisioning of food, while the quality–quantity trade-off seemed {{to be driven by}} sibling rivalry. Further, tending mothers delayed the production of a second clutch, indicating a potential cost of care in terms of lifetime fecundity. This study experimentally shows benefits and potential costs of maternal care and family group formation in the <b>European</b> <b>earwig.</b> More detailed behavioural experiments will be required to fully understand how behavioural interactions among family members mediate these reproductive outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Many insects {{raise their}} {{offspring}} on organic substrates {{or in the}} soil where microorganisms are abundant. Microbes may pose {{a serious threat to}} offspring development and survival by either decomposing food resources or directly infecting the offspring. Selection to cope with these effects may favor social defenses, for example, through forms of parental care that can limit or eliminate these threats to offspring fitness. In this study, we experimentally tested if maternal egg attendance in the <b>European</b> <b>earwig</b> Forficula auricularia has a function as a social defense against mold infection of eggs by manipulating exposure of eggs to mold spores and the presence of the mother in a fully factorial design. Furthermore, we investigated the potential roles of egg grooming behavior and maternal transfer of chemicals as underlying mechanisms. As predicted, the beneficial effect of egg attendance on hatching success was significantly enhanced when eggs were exposed to the mold. Females significantly increased their egg grooming duration in response to mold exposure of her eggs, and the quantity of chemicals (identified as hydrocarbons) was maintained among attended eggs but decreased substantially among unattended eggs. Maternal transfer of chemicals was confirmed in extractions of glass beads that were mingled into attended or unattended clutches. This study shows that maternal egg attendance in the <b>European</b> <b>earwig</b> has a social defense function protecting offspring against mold infection.

40|$|Background The <b>European</b> <b>earwig</b> (Forficula auricularia) is an {{established}} system for studies of sexual selection, social interactions {{and the evolution}} of parental care. Despite its scientific interest, little knowledge exists about the species at the genomic level, limiting the scope of molecular studies and expression analyses of genes of interest. To overcome these limitations, we sequenced and validated the transcriptome of the <b>European</b> <b>earwig.</b> Methodology and Principal Findings To obtain a comprehensive transcriptome, we sequenced mRNA from various tissues and developmental stages of female and male earwigs using Roche 454 pyrosequencing and Illumina HiSeq. The reads were de novo assembled independently and screened for possible microbial contamination and repeated elements. The remaining contigs were combined into a hybrid assembly and clustered to reduce redundancy. A comparison with the eukaryotic core gene dataset indicates that we sequenced a substantial part of the earwig transcriptome with a low level of fragmentation. In addition, a comparative analysis revealed that more than 8, 800 contigs of the hybrid assembly show significant similarity to insect-specific proteins and those were assigned for Gene Ontology terms. Finally, we established a quantitative PCR test for expression stability using commonly used housekeeping genes and applied the method to five homologs of known sex-biased genes of the honeybee. The qPCR pilot study confirmed sex specific expression and also revealed significant expression differences between the brain and antenna tissue samples. Conclusions By employing two different sequencing approaches and including samples obtained from different tissues, developmental stages, and sexes, we were able to assemble a comprehensive transcriptome of F. auricularia. The transcriptome presented here offers new opportunities to study the molecular bases and evolution of parental care and sociality in arthropods...|$|E

The {{aim of this study}} was to characterize the B-esterase activities in the <b>European</b> <b>earwig</b> Forficula auricularia and to evaluate in vitro its sensitivity to organophosphate and carbamate pesticides. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity was mainly measured with 1. 5 mM acetylthi-ocholine as the substrate in the microsomal fraction of earwig heads (70 % of total AChE activity). Carboxylesterase (CbE) activities were measured with three substrates [5 mM 4 -nitrophenyl acetate (4 -NPA), 1 mM 4 -nitrophenyl valerate (4 -NPV), and 2 mM a-naphtyl acetate (a-NA) ] to examine different isoenzymes, which were present mainly in the cytosolic fraction (about 70 – 88 % of total activities) of all earwig tissues. CbE activity was higher than AChE activity, especially with a-NA, then 4 -NPA and lastly 4 -NPV. Chlorpyrifos-oxon an organophosphate, and carbaryl a carbamate pesticide, inhibited AChE and CbE activities in a concentration-dependent manner. Earwig CbE activities showed a stronger sensitivity to organophosphate than AChE, with the strongest effect for chlorpyrifos-oxon on male carboxylesterase activities.

In addition to F. auricularia and F. pubescens, three other earwig species, namely Labidura riparia Pallas, Nala lividipes Dufour and Euborellia moesta Gené, were found occasionally. The mature stages of F. auricularia were observed mainly from May to November in tree shelters and immature ones from October to June in ground shelters.

Adult earwigs were placed in ventilated containers where they were exposed to insecticide residues on apple leaves and monitored on four occasions over 10 days. Indoxacarb, thiacloprid, spinosad and diazinon caused the greatest mortality to earwigs while carbaryl appeared to be less harmful.
