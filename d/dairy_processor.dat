50|$|In the United States, the Dairy Price Support Program is {{the federal}} {{government}} program that maintains a minimum farm price for milk used in the manufacture of dairy products. It is one of many agricultural support programs. Under the dairy program, the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) indirectly assures a minimum price for milk by purchasing any cheddar cheese, nonfat dry milk, and butter offered to it by <b>dairy</b> <b>processors</b> at stated prices. These purchase prices are set high enough to enable <b>dairy</b> <b>processors</b> to pay farmers at least the support price for the milk they use in manufacturing these products.|$|R

30|$|This paper aims to {{evaluate}} technical efficiency in the Sardinian sheep dairy processing sector. A stochastic frontier analysis approach was {{used on a}} panel data from 36 sheep <b>dairy</b> <b>processors</b> over the period 2004 – 2009, {{in order to assess}} whether there are some margins for technical improvements in productivity, given the present state of technology. In other words, our analysis was focused on estimating whether sheep <b>dairy</b> <b>processors</b> could improve their productivity by using their available resources more efficiently, without considering the prices of outputs and inputs. Particular attention was paid to determine the input–output elasticities, the role of inefficiency in explaining different levels of productivity in different firms, and the effects of a number of particular variables on inefficiency. A comparative analysis of private firms and cooperatives was also carried out, in order to establish if there were differences in the technology they used and/or their efficiency in using inputs.|$|R

50|$|If the OFT proves its case, the {{retailers}} could theoretically face fines {{of up to}} 10 per cent of their worldwide turnover, which in Tesco's case would amount to £4.3bn. The Office of Fair Trading told Sainsbury's, Asda, Safeway, Dairy Crest, Wiseman and The Cheese Company they faced maximum fines of £116m, though the final figure may be as low as £80m {{as a result of}} their co-operation. Sainsbury's told the London Stock Exchange that its fine was £26m. The fine for Safeway is thought to be between £8m and £10m; £9m for Dairy Crest and £6m for Robert Wiseman. It is unclear who blew the whistle on the price-fixing but Arla, the <b>dairy</b> <b>processor,</b> will escape a fine after fully co-operating with authorities. Consumer advocate Which?

40|$|The 'dairy industry' {{accounts}} for {{a significant amount of}} wealth creation in New Zealand. It contributes 7 % of the country's GDP, and between 20 - 25 % of its export earnings. Given the absolute export orientation of land-based industries in the country, and particularly of the dairy processing industry, where 95 % of output is exported, the long-term competitiveness of New Zealand <b>dairy</b> <b>processors</b> is set firmly in the international environment. An exploratory investigation of the contextual environment of the global food value system has identified the complex relationships between food processors, food retailers, and food consumers. The observation of the actions and decisions - strategy - pursued by a group of international <b>dairy</b> <b>processors</b> over recent years reveals a strong convergence of patterns among apparently 'dissimilar' organisations. A multiple case study approach to the research was used, supported by extensive primary and secondary data collected over a twelve month period. Nine case study companies were selected and their strategic orientation revealed. There was a high level of convergence between stated and observed strategies, and subsequent outcomes. Industry concentration, consolidation activities, and internationalisation of companies are strategies being pursued among all of the case study companies. Meanwhile, various ownership structures were found to neither hinder large <b>dairy</b> <b>processors</b> from pursuing growth strategies nor hinder them from pursuing added-value strategies. The creation of Fonterra Co-operative Group, the country's largest organisation, and largest exporter of processed dairy products in the world, was a response by the dairy sector to the wider global consolidation/concentration trend. Now, consolidation and concentration in the dairy processing industry in New Zealand has reached a plateau. Without compromising its co-operative structure Fonterra faces the dual challenges of further internationalisation and the continued pursuit of value-added strategies as constructive means to improve shareholders' returns...|$|R

50|$|Killeshandra Co-operative Society Ltd {{was formed}} in December 1896. The milk from 987 cows had been promised by local farmers and a {{committee}} was tentatively decided upon to establish a creamery. Thus began an industry which grew to be recognised {{as a model for}} the rest of the country to follow. It was described as the best creamery of its time, winning prizes for butter and dairy products both at home and abroad. By the time of its centenary year Killeshandra Co-op was handling the milk from over 4,000 farmer suppliers. Today this co-op has transformed through mergers with other dairy companies to form the internationally recognised Lakeland Dairies, the second largest dairy co-operative and third largest <b>dairy</b> <b>processor</b> in Ireland. The Co-op operates across 15 counties on a cross-border basis, processing over 700 million litres of milk annually into a range of value-added products and food ingredients which are exported worldwide.

5000|$|The area {{is first}} {{documented}} {{to have been}} farmed by the Woodside family, which worked land that included this farm's property for about 120 years beginning in 1783. New owners converted it to principally dairy farming in the early 20th century, and in 1941 it was purchased by Maurice Dionne, whose brother Bert, a veterinarian, took over its operation. He greatly expanded its capacity and production, set back by the 1946 fire. It {{is possible that the}} Quonset structures now in use were surplus military materials from the nearby Brunswick Naval Air Station. Its business in decline, the Dionnes sold to the Oakhurst Dairy, a major regional <b>dairy</b> <b>processor.</b> In 1970 the farm's activity was shifted to beef production. [...] In 1997 the Brunswick-Topsham Land Trust purchased 160 acres (since expanded to more than 300), with the aim of preserving the farm as open space and a working agricultural area. It is now used for community-supported agriculture, and the property has walking trails open to the public.|$|E
40|$|Many {{dairy farmer}} groups are {{concerned}} that imports of milk protein concentrates (MPCs) are displacing domestic dairy ingredients and thus depressing farm milk prices. S. 560 and H. R. 1160 would impose tariff rate quotas on certain MPCs, and S. 40 would prohibit the use of dry MPC in domestic cheese production. <b>Dairy</b> <b>processor</b> groups are opposed to these bills.

40|$|The {{main goal}} {{of this paper is}} to compare {{profitability}} of large <b>dairies</b> (<b>processors)</b> versus large milk producers, i. e. farms with 100 or more cows, organized as companies. Profitability is measured by following indicators: return on assets and return on equity. Profitability gap analysis shows that milk processors achieved significantly higher profitability compared to cow breeders. Furthermore research results suggest that the existence of differences in the level of profitability among the participants in the milk production primarily affects capital turnover, and then the profit margin...|$|R

40|$|Traceability is {{the ability}} to track any food, feed, food-producing animal or {{substance}} that will be used for consumption, through all the stages of production, processing, and distribution (European Union, 2002). In this study, an analysis of the traceability systems of three bulk commodities, corn, feed, and milk, was conducted to analyze the internal traceability system of each respective entity, the external traceability system among all entities, and the information exchange and communication between each entity. The objectives of this study were to create a model/map for tracing these commodities, to identify gaps in the internal and external traceability systems, and to provide quality control/quality management strategies to improve the external traceability system. The first step of analysis involved comparing the ISO 22005 traceability standard to the current tracing and tracking system used by the <b>dairy</b> <b>processor.</b> Only 2 of the 9 design components of the Standard were met by the processor due to lack of specified objectives. A concept map was created using supplier/recipient records from the <b>dairy</b> <b>processor</b> and dairy farm. Using records from the processor, information gaps were identified in the traceability system. After identifying gaps, quality control and quality management strategies were developed to help close the gaps and strengthen the external traceability system. A product flow model was also created to determine the location of products from corn to processed milk and to determine what records are kept at each point in the chain. The study showed that once the <b>dairy</b> <b>processor</b> has developed specific objectives to serve as the foundation for their traceability system, the established safety and quality programs that have been implemented and executed can be easily integrated into an ISO 22005 certified traceability system. Since making the decision to fully implement an ISO certified traceability system will require additional information such as risk and cost-benefit analyses, small changes that will yield timely results can be made in the area of quality control...|$|E
40|$|The rural {{economy of}} the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia has been {{adapting}} to new economic and political realities. Especially important for rural areas has been {{the breakdown of the}} socialist market structure in agriculture, which meant the demise of cooperative structures and farmers gaining access to new market outlets. The aim {{of this paper is to}} investigate the potential of dairy sheep farmers to enter into new contracts with buyers and to analyze why some farmers continue selling to traditional market outlets. Using survey data of dairy sheep farmers we studied the choice they make between 3 market outlets: (1) selling milk to a recently established large <b>dairy</b> <b>processor,</b> (2) selling milk to traditional small local processors, or (3) transforming milk on-farm into cheese and selling it at the farm gate or at local markets. The significance of determinants of choice for these markets were tested in a multinomial logit model, which showed that distance to the collection point of the large <b>dairy</b> <b>processor</b> was the most important determinant of whether farmers sold milk or made cheese, with those at a greater distance selling cheese. Furthermore, we analyzed the main sources of transaction costs in developing new market channels. Overcoming transport and transaction costs may contribute to higher income for the farmers and hence to improving their livelihoods...|$|E
