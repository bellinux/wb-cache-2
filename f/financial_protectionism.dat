40|$|During {{the crisis}} of 2008 - 09, many {{countries}} engaged in bank nationalizations and other large public interventions in the financial sector. Did such actions lead to nationalistic changes in financial activities? In this paper we provide the first empirical evidence of such “financial protectionism. ” Manifestations of <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism</b> include {{a decrease in the}} quantity and/or an increase in the price of loans that banks from one country make to borrowers resident in another, after a large public intervention like bank nationalization.

During this time, a number of banks were nationalized, received capital injections, or given unusual access to loan or credit guarantees. We use standard panel-data techniques to study the ‘loan mix, ’ British loans of a bank expressed as a fraction of its total loan activity. We examine the loan mix for British and foreign banks, both before and after unusual public interventions such as nationalizations, and find strong evidence of <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism.</b> After nationalization, foreign banks reduced their fraction of British loans by about eleven percentage points and increased their effective interest rates by about 70 basi...|$|E

In this paper, we aim to prove theoretically and empirically that trade relationship is crucial in eliminating international conflict and promoting cooperation.

Therefore, instead of adopting trade protectionism policies, China and the US should enhance economic cooperation to stabilize the bilateral relations in the context of financial crisis...|$|R

40|$|The {{financial}} crisis {{that began in}} August 2007 and intensified {{in the fall of}} 2008 pushed the global economy into a severe downturn that some have called the Great Recession. The decline in trade and the protectionist instincts that invariably come to the fore in difficult economic times have raised concerns that today's crisis may lead to deglobalization.; We will illustrate the crisis' impact on world trade and examine the typical patterns of international trade over the business cycle. We urge caution in using trade data to estimate the extent of globalization or deglobalization. And we present evidence that international trade has fallen by more than expected given the course of the current business cycle.; This raises the question of what might have accounted for the excess decline. We look at two possibilities: first, a direct effect on trade flows associated with a drying up of trade finance {{at the height of the}} crisis; second, a breakout of protectionist measures. We conclude that trade finance is the most likely explanation. However, it's vitally important to remain vigilant to the risks of <b>protectionism.</b> <b>Financial</b> crises; Recessions; Business cycles; Globalization; International trade; Trade credit...|$|R

Economic politics form a European level, on currently relevant economic crisis, have an impact on social changes exacerbated by the resources crisis and the environment's critical state. The economic crisis's domino outcome overshadows the Europe's social and economic future, and will suffer. Currently, the conflict between national and community interest (trade and <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism)</b> generates tensions between European countries, creating "asymmetries regarding economic relaunch".

40|$|This {{paper is}} a {{normative}} {{analysis of the}} legal restrictions on international financial movements based on a formal model which analyzes the empirical observation {{that the degree of}} <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism</b> is associated with changes in the distribution of welfare among agents. The strategic interactions among four types of agents (a trade union, a firm manager, a financial investor and a government) are analyzed, and the optimal amount of capital control is derived as a Nash perfect equilibrium of a non-cooperative game with imperfect information. I conclude that a financial liberalization proposal can be supported by different coalitions of agents, according to the covariance of domestic and foreign returns and the degree of profitability of domestic industrial projects.

40|$|The {{world of}} {{international}} finance {{is in the}} process of transformation. A new group of emerging market economies and members of GCC are emerging as major exporters of capital. Sovereign Wealth Funds (SWFs) are their instruments of interacting with the global capital markets. Although they are an instrument of enhancing liquidity and financial resource allocation in the international capital market, they have become a source of controversies and threaten an escalation in <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism.</b> SWFs are state-owned and managed and have started playing a decisive role in underpinning, sustaining, and expanding financial globalization. Popular and financial media did not begin copious discussions regarding the operations of the SWF until the last quarter of 2007, when they acquired considerable eminence due to their increasing operations. The sub-prime mortgage crisis in the US created severe credit crunch, which precipitously worsened to a crisis proportion in the third week of September 2008. This credit crunch became a window of opportunity for the SWFs. Total assets under management of the SWFs were on an increase. However, their state-ownership and lack of transparency has created considerable anxiety about their operations. The SWFs are being viewed as turning from creditors to owners. Large and diversified portfolio investments by SWFs entail few risks for the international financial market; anxiety about them is exaggerated. Restrictions from host economies on SWFs activities would deprive the international financial markets of a cash-rich market player. Rise of <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism</b> would work as a barricade against the expanding globalization. Participation of the SWF in the international financial system can be improved by policy initiatives at three levels, namely, the SWF level, the host economy level and by the international institutions like the IMF, which needs to devise a set of best practices for the operations of the SWFs. ...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{theoretical}} and an empirical {{discussion of the}} post-crisis supremacy of financial integration over <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism</b> are proposed. The debate is done through {{a survey of the}} advantages each line of thinking brings about to improve economic performance and reduce crisis probability or its magnitude. Moreover, in this paper we study the impact of financial integration through capital mobility on economic growth of a sample of emerging countries. The contribution of our paper is the use of a number of capital mobility openness measures. Thus, we propose to test whether this impact varies with the used measure, the time period and the sample of selected countries. We adopted a panel data analysis technique proposed by Arellano and Bond. With reference to the different estimations conducted, we can conclude that the impact of capital mobility liberalization on economic growth depends on the openness indicator or measure used, the sample of countries studied and the time period examined...|$|E
40|$|The {{decrease}} of financial integration {{both at the}} global and European level reflects, to a certain extent, a market response to the crisis. It might, however, also be partly driven by policies such as capital flow management measures (CFMs). In addition, several other measures taken by central banks, regulators and governments {{in response to the}} crisis may have had less obvious negative side effects on financial integration. Against this backdrop, this paper explores broad definitions of <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism</b> in order to raise awareness {{of the fact that the}} range of policies which could negatively affect financial integration may be much wider than residency-based CFMs. At the same time, the paper acknowledges that these measures have mostly been taken for legitimate financial stability purposes and with no protectionist intentions. The paper considers five categories of policy measures which could contribute to financial fragmentation both at the global and at the EU level: currency-based measures directed towards banks, geographic ring fencing, some financial repression policies, crisis resolution policies with a national bias, and some financial sector taxes...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the recent}} period, many {{emerging}} market economies and commodity-exporting nations are experiencing unprecented growth and accumulating unprecedented amounts {{of foreign exchange}} reserves. The management of these foreign reserves {{has led to the}} emergence of an important financial actor, namely the sovereign wealth fund (SWF). While SWFs have existed {{in one form or another}} since the 1950 s, it is only recently that they have risen in prominence and been exposed to public scrutiny and debate. In this paper, we outline their possible impact on international financial stability. We conclude that SWFs are long-term investors who can play a stabilizing role in financial markets by supplying liquidity and reducing market volatility. SWFs are also contributing to the gradual unwinding of global imbalances as they gradually diversify their portfolios. While the potential for destabilization by one or more SWFs does exist if other investors mimic the same investment strategies, there is little evidence of this occurring during the recent period. Similarly, the rise of <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism</b> as host countries adopt rules to protect sensitive industries might unduly restrict global capital flows, but is not likely to destabilize the international financial system...|$|E
40|$|Purpose – Over {{the last}} two decades global {{cross-border}} investment has increased. State-owned and managed, sovereign-wealth funds (SWFs), largely from the emerging-market economies, have started playing a decisive role in underpinning, sustaining and expanding financial globalization. This paper aims to provide the reader with basic conceptual strands on the SWF, their genesis, coming into prime and recent spurt in their operations. Design/methodology/approach – The paper focuses on defining SWFs and tracks their origin and growth. It explores the present and future market size of SWFs and examines the ramifications of this group of large institutional investors. It also answers the query whether anxieties about their operations are exaggerated and attempts to provide answers regarding some of the prickly policy questions. Findings – The paper finds that, although they are an instrument of enhancing liquidity and financial resource allocation in the international capital market, they have become a source of controversies and threaten and escalation in <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism.</b> Originality/value – The paper focuses on the concept of SWFs and the recent spurt in their activities and significance.

40|$|Sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) {{have become}} a {{prominent}} feature of the international financial landscape. They are sufficiently diverse in their origins, structures, and objectives that generalizations are perilous. However, legitimate concerns have been raised in home and host countries about the management, behavior, and interactions of these funds. Many of those concerns can be addressed via increased accountability and transparency. The Santiago Principles are a good start in doing so, but Edwin M. Truman's SWF scoreboard points to areas where these principles can be improved. Meanwhile, SWF compliance must be further increased. At the same time, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) effort to address concerns from the host-country side has not resulted in the erection of new barriers to that form of cross-border investment, but the OECD failed to reverse the creeping <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism</b> of the past decade. Because of their size {{and the source of}} their funding, some Asian funds are different. As a result, they will be held to a higher standard of accountability and transparency even as their government owners press for more openness to cross-border investment.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the change in {{response}} of Latin American governments to the economic crisis and thus {{the change in the}} character of protectionist measures applied. How do the means of the protection of domestic market change? How does the financial globalization reflect in the Latin American protectionism? What are the further perspectives of the development of Latin American countries? The thesis is divided into three chapters. The first chapter examines the forms of protectionism in the reaction to economic crisis of the 20 th century. Firstly, it presents Latin America as a traditionally protectionist region in the period of the import substitution industrialization, secondly it focuses on governments' reactions to the cyclic crises of the 80 s and 90 s that were caused by the liberalization of the capital accounts and high sensitivity of Latin American economies to the sudden stop on financial markets. The second chapter is devoted to the current global economic crisis. It analyses the means of trade and <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism.</b> Simultaneously, it compares the protectionist measures used to the ones employed in previous periods. The final part of the thesis explores further perspectives of Latin American regionalism and improved macroeconomic stability of Latin American economies...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{striking}} financial developments in recent years was the emergence of sovereign wealth funds (SWFs) – large publicly owned investment portfolios, which until recently were growing rapidly in both number and size. In a global environment already roiled by a prolonged credit crisis, SWFs raise tricky and potentially controversial new questions for international financial regulation. One issue of concern to many in host countries is the possibility that some SWFs might be used for overt or tacit political purposes, posing a challenge for global monetary governance: a Great Tradeoff between, on the one hand, the world community’s collective interest in sustaining the openness of capital markets; and on the other hand, the legitimate national security concerns of individual host countries. Can some balance between the two be found that will be both stable and acceptable to all concerned? Individually as well as collectively, recipient countries have begun to address the regulatory challenge directly. To date, however, accomplishments have been slight and have failed to stem a noticeable drift toward <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism.</b> A review of some recent proposals suggests that there is no foolproof solution to the Great Tradeoff. But the potential for controversy could be significantly reduced by a negotiated agreement among host governments addressing three key issues: (1) definitions; (2) risk assessment; and (3) dispute resolution. The most logical venue for such an exercise would be the OECD, building on its already extensive experience with international investment issues...|$|E
40|$|After {{significant}} headway towards {{liberalization of}} capital {{movements in the}} early 1960 s, European governments resorted massively to capital controls in the turmoil of {{the demise of the}} Bretton Woods system. In some countries (Italy among others), what looked like a temporary backlash against incipient financial globalisation caused an escalation of domestic and external controls, leading to a comprehensive and long-lasting regime of financial repression. Why financial repression was so hard to dismantle, in spite of its widely recognized distortionary impact? Why did governments stick so long to sub-optimal policy instruments? By concentrating on the Italian case, this paper argues that a public finance approach may provide an answer to such questions. More specifically, following the literature on the political economy of capital controls and the fiscal implications of financial repression, the paper suggests that policies increasing revenues from implicit taxation may be regarded as an attempt to postpone the structural change in the established fiscal policy regime that capital liberalization necessarily entailed. As capital controls (and financial repression, more generally) substantially contributed to ease the government’s budget constraint under conditions of structural deficit and rapidly rising debt, liberalization was expected to exacerbate fiscal problems. The paper illustrates the policy measures deployed to increase seigniorage revenues, grant implicit subsidies to the government and enforce <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism.</b> It also provides for the first time an estimation of the economic relevance of revenues from financial repression, which proved to be of a magnitude comparable to revenues from seigniorage. High revenues from implicit taxation (relative to GDP) can be considered a rough approximation of the cost of financial liberalization and may explain why the process of financial reform was slow and controversial. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this present study is to {{identify}} and evaluate obstacles {{in the way of}} liberalising banking and insurance services in the EC area. Two countries are used as cases for this purpose: the UK and Greece. The UK cases represent the barriers to freedom of financial services in the developed EC countries while the Greek cases represent those of the developing EC countries. The distinction between developed and developing countries is considered as necessary since the rationales that exist for erecting barriers to freedom of financial services seem to vary according to the level of development. In the developed countries protectionist measures are imposed to safeguard the interests of the consumers, while in the developing countries the placing of strict barriers to trade in international financial services is used mainly as support for protection of the domestic financial sector and <b>financial</b> <b>protectionism.</b> In the UK case studies barriers in the way of liberalising banking and insurance services are identified and evaluated {{in the light of the}} divergence of supervisory philosophies and practices between the UK and the continental European countries. The UK authorities have adopted a flexible supervisory system which is considered by the other European countries as one that moves in a direction inconsistent with the objective of preserving the integrity of the financial system. In the Greek case studies the analysis suggests that the unification of the European financial sectors would have detrimental effects not only on the domestic financial sector but also on the whole economy. The authorities would find it very difficult to accept a measure which would bring about complete freedom of competition, particularly within the timescale set by the EC Commission - ie the end of 1992...|$|E
