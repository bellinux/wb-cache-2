The modal Hf content and modal Zr/Hf ratio of zircon taken from the data are 1. 43 wt% HfO 2 and 38. 5 respectively. Estimated partition coefficients are 2520 for DZr and 2420 for DHf between zircon and granitic magma. The large and similar Zr and Hf partition coefficients indicate that the crystallization of zircon would deplete the melt in both Zr and Hf, but would not cause significant fractionation of Zr from Hf.

During the late Quaternary, the cyclic development and decay of huge ice sheets on adjacent land masses resulted in large-amplitude changes in sedimentation rates and organic paleoproductivities. The resulting magnification of U and Th response is well illustrated by high-resolution studies on piston-cored sediments from the Greenland continental rise at Ocean Drilling Program Leg 105 Site 646 spanning isotopic stages 8 to 1. Our results show a clear positive correlation of 238 U/ 232 Th ratios with organic paleoproductivity indicators (e. g., dinocyst) due to U uptake {{in the water column}} and/or during the early early diagenesis of organic matter responding to carbon fluxes and to their climate forcing. 230 Th excesses over 234 U exceed the theoretical value of the 230 Th rain from the overlying water column, indicating lateral input possibly from the Greenland slope and shelf. Because these horizontal fluxes of 230 Th may be partly controlled by physical parameters, 230 Th excesses cannot be unequivocally correlated with sedimentation rates and/or productivity as reported elsewhere.

40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{potentiality}} of soil CO 2 diffuse degassing measurements {{for the study of}} underground mass and heat transfer in geothermal systems detailed surveys were performed at Latera Caldera which is an excellent test site, due to the abundant available subsurface data. Over 2500 measurements of soil CO 2 flux revealed that endogenous CO 2 at Latera Caldera concentrates on a NE-SW band coinciding with a structural high of fractured Mesozoic limestones hosting a water-dominated high-enthalpy geothermal reservoir. The total hydrothermal CO 2 degassing from the structural high has been evaluated at 350 t d- 1 from an area of 3. 1 km 2. It has been estimated that such a CO 2 release would imply a geothermal liquid flux of 263 kg s- 1, with a heat release of 239 MW. The chemical and isotopic composition of the gas indicates a provenance from the geothermal reservoir and that CO 2 is partly originated by thermal metamorphic decarbonation in the hottest deepest parts of the system and partly has a likely mantle origin.

40|$|Based on {{previous}} laboratory experiments simulating solar wind sputtering of lunar surface materials, {{it appears that}} solar wind ions sputter secondary ions in sufficient numbers to be measured from low-altitude lunar orbit. Solar wind protons are hundreds of times less efficient than those used in standard secondary ion mass spectrometry; nevertheless secondary ions of Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Mn, Ti and Fe were observed sputtered from sample simulants of mare and highland soils. These secondary ion fluxes depend both on concentration in the soil and on probability of ionization; yields of easily ionized elements such as K and Na are relatively much greater than those for the more electronegative elements and compounds. The principal <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicator</b> elements Na, Mg, Al, Si, K, Ca, Ti, Mn and Fe are nevertheless detectable. However, {{it has not been}} shown that the observed secondary ions vary strictly one-to-one with their concentrations in the geochemically distinct soil simulants used here. While we have a first order understanding of secondary ion sputtering, {{it is not clear that}} the observed ion yields can be linked with great accuracy to the simulant's composition. The simulants were analyzed by electron microprobe to establish their detailed composition. The observed secondary ion fluxes can then be compared with the microprobe results. For example Ti(+) fluxes from the three simulants correspond to the true composition with accuracies of better than 10 percent for the high-Ti basalt, and about 20 percent for the low-Ti simulant. The highlands simulant produced a statistically insignificant Ti(+) count rate. Here we discuss the results of further SIMS experiments using the ASU/Center for Solid State Science facility.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} mineralogical, geochemical and geochronological {{studies in}} the Variscides and Uralides to elucidate the petrochemical history of dynamic orogenic processes. In combination with published data the results highlight significant differences between both orogens. Pre-orogenic (i. e. pre-Uralian) basement is incorporated to different degrees and in contrasting patterns in Variscides and Uralides. In the Variscides numerous different terranes were agglomerated in a complicated large scale bow-shaped pattern, whereas in the Uralides mainly the fragments of the longitudinally trending eastern margin of Baltica were incorporated. The Taratash Complex of the Middle Urals is an outstanding example of such fragments. This thesis delineates a succession of Palaeoproterozoic magmatic and amphibolite facies tectonometamorphic events (2. 46 – 1. 8 Ga) following Archean granulite facies metamorphism and granitoid formation (3. 65 – 2. 91 Ga) recorded in the rocks of the Taratash Complex. In the Uralides, pre-orogenic basement is restricted {{to the west of}} the Main Uralian Fault leading to a simple geometry compared to the Variscides. In both orogens, pre-Neoproterozoic rocks are only preserved in basement slivers, whereas remnants of Neoproterozoic magmatism and tectonism are abundant. For the southern Urals this is shown in a study of detrital zircon. Isotope signatures (U/Pb) of detrital zircon serve as <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicator</b> for the dynamic process of terrane accretion and for the transition from a passive to an active continental margin around 620 Ma, which affected large parts of the eastern margin of Baltica. The main suture lines and associated former subduction zones can well be traced in the Variscides (i. e. Rheic suture) and Uralides (i. e. Main Uralian Fault), although secondary suture lines in both orogens require further characterization for better understanding. Different to the Variscides, where high-pressure metamorphic rocks are known in all major terranes, such rocks are exclusively observed along the Main Uralian Fault in the Uralides. Lawsonite bearing mineral assemblages in rodingitized ultramafite of the Maksyutov Complex (Southern Urals) that are investigated in a part of this thesis are an example of such metamorphism related to the dynamic process of subduction. In contrast to the Variscides, which are characterized by large scale lithospheric reequilibration, the Uralides were not affected by significant orogenic collapse and postorogenic extension. This is also reflected in the preservation of prograde high-pressure/low-temperature metamorphic assemblages in the Maksyutov Complex (e. g. Lawsonite-bearing assemblages) and associated low-temperature pseudomorphs presented in this thesis. The lack of postorogenic extension highlights that the Uralides are characterized by a pronounced and isostatically equilibrated crustal root. During the Variscan orogenesis existing continental crust was extensively recycled. In contrast to this, large amounts of juvenile crust, which formed in magmatic arcs, are a characteristic feature of the Uralian orogen. Here, data are presented for the Valerianovka arc in the Transuralian zone, which is rarely addressed in the literature. It is shown that granitoids formed by mixing of slab-derived melts and melts generated in the crust. This result supports the model of an Andean type setting. Juvenile crust is particularly dominating in the Easturalian zone, where granitoids also formed after accretion of magmatic arcs. In this thesis it is demonstrated that the Borisov granite intruded in a first pulse of melt generation at 358 ± 23 Ma. Granitoid melt formation as well as high-temperature amphibolite facies metamorphic overprint of host rocks also reflect the dynamic process of crustal thickening during the Uralian orogeny. Variscides and Uralides also vary with respect to their crustal architecture. Major crustal units of the Variscan orogen have a subhorizontal orientation, whereas crustal scale structural boundaries in the Uralides are high angle fault zones. Such structural differences are in line with the observation that the Variscides experienced significant crustal shortening, whereas the Uralides were affected by lower degrees of shortening. This can be demonstrated in a comparison of the Rhenohercynian (Variscan) and the Westuralian foreland fold and thrust belts. Expulsion of hydrothermal fluids to the Variscan foreland during the dynamic process of orogenic compaction is investigated in this thesis applying various techniques. Enrichment of mobile components, such as Ba and NH 4, in sedimentary rocks studied in the RWTH- 1 well in Aachen (Germany) serves as <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicator</b> for palaeo fluid-flow. Illite mineralogy, fluid inclusion petrography and microthermometry as well as isotope geochemistry of fluid inclusions and vein minerals suggest that expulsion of metamorphic fluids at the Variscan front was a short termed (approx. 5000 y) process, which was affected by fracture opening during episodic seismic activity and which occurred at depths between 4500 and 8000 m and temperatures close to 400 °C. Both, Variscan and Uralian orogens were affected by post-Palaeozoic deformation, however Alpine reworking significantly obliterated Variscan structures, in particular in the southern part of the Variscides...|$|E
40|$|Approximately > 50 % {{of global}} {{rare earth element}} (REE) {{resources}} are hosted by carbonatite related deposits, of which monazite {{is one of the}} most important REE minerals. Monazite dominates more than 30 carbonatite-related REE deposits around the world, including currently exploited mineralization at Bayan Obo and Mount Weld. These deposits are widely distributed across all continents, except Antarctica. Though rare, monazite occurs as the primary mineral in carbonatite, and mostly presents as a secondary mineral that has a strong association with apatite. It can partially or completely replace thin or thick overgrowth apatite, depending on the availability of REE. Other mineral phases that usually crystallize together with monazite include barite, fluorite, xenotime, sulfide, and quartz in a carbonate matrix (e. g., dolomite, calcite). This review of monazite geochemistry within carbonatite-related REE deposits aims to provide information regarding the use of monazite as a <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicator</b> to track the formation history of the REE deposits and also supply additional information for the beneficiation of monazite. The chemical compositions of monazite are highly variable, and Ce-monazite is the dominant solid solution in carbonatite related deposits. Most monazite displays steep fractionation from La to Lu, absent of either Eu or Ce anomalies in the chondrite normalized REE plot. The other significant components are huttonite and cheratite. Some rare sulfur-bearing monazite is also identified with an SO 3 content up to 4 wt %. A 147 Sm/ 144 Nd ratio with an average ~ 0. 071 for monazite within carbonatite-related ores is similar to that of their host rocks (~ 0. 065), and is the lowest among all types of REE deposits. Sm/Nd variation of monazite from a single complex reflects the differentiation stage of magma, which decreases from early to late. Based on the differences of Nd and Sr abundances, Nd isotopic composition for monazite can be used to track the magma source, whereas Sr isotopic composition records the signatures of the fluid source. Th-(U) -Pb age determination of the secondary monazite records variable thermal or metasomatic disturbances, and careful geochronological interpretation should be brought forward combined with other lines of evidence. ThO 2 is the most difficult contamination in the beneficiation of monazite, luckily, the ThO 2 content of monazite within carbonatite is generally low (< 2 wt %) ...|$|E

Thermogenic gas hydrate and associated sediment were recovered from the northern Gulf of Mexico east of the Mississippi Canyon to investigate the interactions between gas hydrate and sedimentary sulfides. Sediment solid phase analyses included total reduced sulfide (TRS), acid volatile sulfide, and citrate-dithionate and HCl extractable iron. Pore-fluid measurements included []H?S, chloride, sulfate, ammonia and total dissolved inorganic carbon. Gas hydrate hydrogen sulfide and carbon dioxide content were measured using a new wet chemical technique. The []??S relative to Vienna Canyon Diablo troilite was determined for TRS and hydrate H?S. Extensive (> 95 %) reduction of pore-fluid sulfate occurred, resulting in exceptionally high []H?S concentrations (up to ~ 10 mM) and TRS concentrations (271 ? 50 []mole/g). However, the mole fraction of H?S within the gas hydrate was too low (~ 0. 3 %) to significantly influence hydrate stability. This appears related to high reactive iron concentrations which average 256 ? 66 []mol/g (pyrite iron + HCl extractable iron). These iron-rich sediments are thus capable of sequestering much of the generated sulfide in the form of TRS minerals, thereby making it unavailable for incorporation by gas hydrate. The TRS concentrations are about an order of magnitude greater than expected for sites at similar water depths in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Steep dissolved []H?S concentration gradients were observed both above and below the gas hydrate indicating diffusion of sulfide from the surrounding system into the gas hydrate.

A variety of mineralogical and <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicators</b> for aqueous alteration on Mars have been identified {{by a combination of}} surface and orbital robotic missions, telescopic observations, characterization of Martian meteorites, and laboratory and terrestrial analog studies. Mineralogical indicators for aqueous alteration include goethite (lander), jarosite (lander), kieserite (orbiter), gypsum (orbiter) and other Fe-, Mg-, and Ca-sulfates (landers), halides (meteorites, lander), phyllosilicates (orbiter, meteorites), hematite and nanophase iron oxides (telescopic, orbiter, lander), and Fe-, Mg-, and Ca-carbonates (meteorites). <b>Geochemical</b> <b>indicators</b> (landers only) for aqueous alteration include Mg-, Ca-, and Fe-sulfates, halides, and secondary aluminosilicates such as smectite. Based upon these indicators, several styles of aqueous alteration have been suggested on Mars. Acid-sulfate weathering (e. g., formation of jarosite, gypsum, hematite, and goethite), may occur during (1) the oxidative weathering of ultramafic igneous rocks containing sulfides, (2) sulfuric acid weathering of basaltic materials, and (3) acid fog (i. e., vapors rich in H 2 SO 4) weathering of basaltic or basaltic-derived materials. Near-neutral or alkaline alteration occurs when solutions with pH near or above 7 move through basaltic materials and form phases such as phyllosilicates and carbonates. Very low water:rock ratios appear to have been prominent at most of the sites visited by landed missions because there is very little alteration (leaching) of the original basaltic composition (i. e., the alteration is isochemical or in a closed hydrologic system).

The {{local and}} global {{dimensions}} of metaliferrous air pollution derived from a reconstruction of an 8 thousand year record of copper smelting and mining at a desert-mountain frontier in southern Jordan. Journal of Archaeological Science 34, 83 - 110 This paper establishes an eight thousand year history of anthropogenic metal pollution {{at one of the}} oldest, most important and longest sustained sites of the extraction and smelting of copper ores in the Old World: the Faynan Orefield in Jordan, which is located between the hyper-arid southern desert and the front of the wetter Mountains of Edom. The modern land surface is shown, in significant part, to be a complex palimpsest of archaeological sites, metal pollution of various ages and ore processing deposits. Quantitative and qualitative observations of the storage and cycling of heavy metals through the local natural and domestic systems have produced a body of information on processes with which the past has been interpreted. Heavy metal concentrations in semi-continuous sedimentary bodies indicate that over the last 1500 years, metals were removed by natural processes at a comparatively slow rate given the scale of the original anthropogenic metal burden: the proportions of lead with respect to copper have increased as the overall metal burden has been lowered. Distinctive anthropogenic metal-pollution signatures have been detected in ash- and charcoal-rich deposits that were discarded onto the banks of a perennial stream in the late Neolithic. At present, the nature of the human activities that might have produced these pollution signatures is unknown. Substantial metal pollution from industrial-scale smelting activity was present from the Early Bronze Age. The intensity of heavy metal pollution produced in Classical Times locally exceeded that recorded at major European copper smelting centres in the nineteenth century A. D. The pollution evidence indicates that intensive copper smelting at the immediate area took place until approximately the end of the Byzantine period; {{with the exception of one}} further minor episode of smelting radiocarbon dated to cal.

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{conditions}} for underground gas storage (UGS) objects establishment {{is the presence of}} hydrogeologically isolated structures. These are mainly exhausted hydrocarbon deposits and aquifers in the Cenozoic fill and the basement of the Danube Basin. The <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicators</b> used to determine the aquifer isolation level of potential underground gas storage objects are based on the ratio of stagnant and dynamic water components. The most widely used indicator is the rHCO 3 /rCl molar ratio, assuming that the HCO 3 - concentration represents the dynamic origin of dissolved rock material by meteoric water and that the Cl- concentration is the stagnant marine component. To distinguish these two components of the water in the aquifers the rHCO 3 /rCl indicator was combined with other parameters, such as rCl/rSO 4 and rCl/rBr molar ratios. As for more aquifers of the Danube Basin contain higher amounts of carbon-dioxide we attempted to quantify the influence of the carbon dioxide on the water chemistry. The numerical model simulating rock-marine water interactions under different PCO 2 temperature and ion-exchange conditions proved the rHCO 3 /rCl molar ratio increase caused higher carbon dioxide partial pressure for this purpose. Consequently under the conditions of higher partial carbon dioxide pressure the rHCO 3 /rCl ratio is indicating a lower isolation level of the structure. Taking in account signs of the higher carbon dioxide pressure based on the numerical model combined with the abovementioned <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicators</b> the most convenient aquifers for UGS establishment were identified within the Slovak part of the Danube Basin. These are located within Badenian sediments in the Trakovice and Sereď areas, due to the presence of hydrogeologically isolated structures buried at depth intervals of 800 to 1150 m below ground level. Other potential convertible aquifers are present in the Lower and Middle Badenian sediments in the Komjatice and Želiezovce Depressions, especially in the following localities: Modrany at 1145 to 1670 m below the surface, Vráble approximately up to 2110 m and Zlaté Moravce at 1364 to 1374 m below surface...|$|R
40|$|<b>Geochemical</b> and {{microbiological}} <b>indicators</b> {{of methane}} (CH 4) production, oxidation and migration processes in groundwater {{are important to}} understand when attributing sources of gas. The processes controlling the natural occurrence of CH 4 in groundwater must be understood, especially when considering the potential impacts of the global expansion of coal seam gas (CSG) production on groundwater quality and quantity. We use geochemical and microbiological data, along with measurements of CH 4 isotopic composition (δ 13 C-CH 4), to determine the processes acting upon CH 4 in a freshwater alluvial aquifer that directly overlies coal measures targeted for CSG production in Australia. Measurements of CH 4 indicate that there is biogenic CH 4 in the aquifer; however, microbial data indicate {{that there are no}} methanogenic archaea in the groundwater. In addition, geochemical data, particularly the isotopes of dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) and dissolved organic carbon (DOC), as well as the concentration of SO 4 2 −, indicate limited potential for methanogenesis in situ. Microbial community analysis also shows that aerobic oxidation of CH 4 occurs in the alluvial aquifer. The combination of microbiological and <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicators</b> suggests that the most likely source of CH 4, where it was present in the freshwater aquifer, is the upward migration of CH 4 from the underlying coal measures...|$|R
40|$|Part 1 of {{the present}} work elucidated some general {{considerations}} of inorganic matter in coal and determined and explained the relationships, namely statistically significant positive or negative correlations, for chemical characteristics. Complete data from chemical (proximate, ultimate and ash analyses) and mineral composition (major and minor minerals) of 37 coal samples worldwide were used for that purpose. The present Part 2 provides and explains the significant correlations for minerals of these coals. Then, some important relationships between the composition and rank and ash-fusion characteristics of the coals are described. Further, definitive mineralogical and <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicators</b> for genetic interpretations of coal formation are summarized. Finally, the potential implications of these relationships and indicators are discussed and certain new features {{that may be used}} as criteria for clarifying the coal properties and for predicting specific technological and environmental problems related to this fuel are also introduced and suggested.

40|$|Abstract: The Guangyuan area {{is located}} in the {{northern}} section of the Longmenshan fault zone, with strong tectonic activity, complex and changeable strata, low level of exploration and complex development status of shale. Through such means as field sample collections, section measurements and indoor organic geochemical experiments, gas content tests and physical characteristics test of Shale, critical data, such as the depth(1000 - 2000 m), thickness(30 - 50 m), organic <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicators</b> and gas content(1. 55 m 3 /t) of shale in the study area, have been determined. Based on the study of tectonic movements and depositional environment in the region, combined with the rule of shale gas reservoirs formed by rich aggregation, favorable area for shale development in the study area has been identified with the method of multi-factors superposition. The favorable area {{is located in}} southeast of Guangyuan area and the area is approximate 300 km...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Modal analysis, bulk-rock {{geochemistry}} and Fe-Ti mineral {{chemistry of}} the Late Triassic Carpathian Keuper sandstones indicate that their mineralogy being mainly quartz-dominated, with variable amounts of feldspars and rock fragments and {{are classified as}} quartz arenites, sub-litharenites and sub-arkoses, suggesting derivation mainly from acid igneous rocks, gneisses and older sandstones. These are common constituents of the basement rocks in the area studied and the surroundings. Their bulk-rock geochemistry supports the petrographic results and indicates that they are virtually Fe-rich, lithic sandstones/quartz arkosic sandstones. Fe-Ti oxide minerals chemistry suggests a metamorphic rather than igneous sources. Based on the mineralogical and <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicators,</b> the probable provenance of the Keuper sandstones was mainly the metamorphic and igneous rocks of the crystalline cores of the Western Carpathians and the foreland of the Bohemian Massif which were weathered and deposited in the continental mainly fluvial and littoral environments of deposition of the Keuper Formation...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationships}} between the chemical and mineral composition of 37 coal samples from Australia, Bulgaria, USA, Japan, Canada, South Africa, China, Spain, and Ukraine, which differ considerably in their geology, rank, age, ash yield, chemistry and mineralogy, have been investigated. For that purpose complete data from chemical (proximate, ultimate and ash analyses) and mineral composition (major and minor minerals) of these samples have been used. The study explains initially some general considerations of the inorganic matter in coal. Then, the work provides and elucidates the statistically significant positive or negative correlations of chemical characteristics of the coals studied. Further, different <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicators</b> for some genetic interpretations of coal formation are also provided and described.

40|$|The article {{presents}} a lithogenetic typification {{of the rocks}} of the Ust-Kutskian horizon of the Teterian formation in {{the central part of}} the Nepa-Botuobin anteclise. A generalized scheme-model of their formation is drawn up. Granular dolomites have been identified as the most promising lithogenetic type to allocate zones with improved reservoir properties. The structure of the void space of the Ust-Kutskian horizon is characterized. Based on the quantitative assessment of pores and caverns, the presence of salts in them, a correlation was established between these parameters and the reservoir properties of the rocks. The connection with post-sedimentation processes is shown. The conditions for the formation of the Ust-Kutskian depositsare reconstructed with the use of <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicators</b> for element-impurities. As a result of the studies, a set of criteria for local forecasting of reservoirs for setting up the first stage of exploration and development has been developed...|$|R
40|$|A subducted oceanic crustal origin {{for most}} {{eclogite}} xenoliths in kimberlites {{has long been}} a cornerstone of tectonic models for craton development. However, eclogite xenoliths often have protracted and complex histories involving multiple metasomatic events that could overprint some of the key <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicators</b> typically taken as evidence of a subducted origin (e. g., garnet d 18 O-values and mineral 87 Sr/ 86 Sr compositions). To assess the potential for disturbance of oxygen isotopic compositions in mantle eclogites via diamond-forming and other possible metasomatic fluids, we have conducted a multitechnique in situ study of a diamondiferous eclogite xenolith from the Roberts Victor kimberlite, S. Africa. Using SIMS we provide the first texturally-controlled in situ measurements of d 18 O-values in eclogitic garnet in close proximity to diamond. Garnet and clinopyroxene modal proportions are heterogeneous in the xenolith and garnet compositions vary from Mg# = 75. 8 – 79. 2; grossular proportions = 8. 05 – 10. 14 mol. ...|$|R
30|$|The {{results of}} oil family {{classification}} indicated {{that most of}} the oils in the Paleozoic reservoirs in the Halahatang region are genetically identical and should be grouped as one single oil family (Zhang et al. 2000; Zhang and Huang 2005; Chang et al. 2013 a; Xiao et al. 2016; Li et al. 2018). The oil migration orientation and filling pathway traced by various molecular <b>geochemical</b> <b>indicators</b> show that oils mainly migrated from south to north and the predicted source kitchen is located in the Manxi Low Uplift (Chang et al. 2013 b; Xiao et al. 2016; Li et al. 2018). Combining with the homogenization temperature of fluid inclusions and reconstructed burial and geothermal histories, previous studies show that the Ordovician carbonate reservoirs have experienced two major oil charging events. These two phases of oil charging and entrapment timing are the Middle to Late Silurian and the Miocene to Pliocene, respectively (Chang et al. 2013 b; Xiao et al. 2016; Li et al. 2018).|$|R
