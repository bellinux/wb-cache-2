Using a {{comprehensive}} forest sector {{model with a}} detailed carbon cycle section we show that the renewability and carbon neutrality arguments do not warrant <b>emission</b> <b>free</b> treatment of forest bioenergy. However, under the biomass stock change carbon accounting convention followed by UNFCCC and IPCC, the forest owners pay for the roundwood emissions and, to avoid double counting, the use of roundwood is treated as <b>emission</b> <b>free.</b> The bioenergy from harvest residues cannot be treated as <b>emission</b> <b>free</b> either. Their emission factors are determined through the decay time-scales specific to residue fractions and discount rate used in welfare assessment. In addition, we show that an optimal policy subsidizes the production of wood products sequestering carbon. The relative magnitude of the subsidy {{is based on the}} fraction of the carbon stored, the lifetime of the products and the discount rate. Correspondingly, the carbon removals by biomass growth are subsidized and the harvest residue generation taxed. Further, we show that the supply side policies are independent of final use of harvested timber. Numerical solution of the model shows that, although the use of wood is not <b>emission</b> <b>free,</b> it is optimal to increase the use of wood, possibly also in the energy sector. Before the wood use can be increased, the forest biomass has to be increased. This initial carbon sink speeds up the convergence to the lower steady-state atmospheric carbon stock...|$|E

40|$|The {{endeavor}} for a {{more sustainable}} power generation {{has led to a}} dramatic increase in power generation from renewable energy sources (RES), such as wind and solar. These sources are of fluctuating nature and therefore introduce new challenges to power system operation, which was historically designed for generators with constant infeed. The fluctuations are balanced by ancillary services contracted from flexible generators or storages. So far, large scale solutions for storage are only provided by pumped hydro. However, one potential solution for a large storage could be to aggregate Plug-In Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), once they are adopted on a wide scale, into a virtual storage. This storage could then be used to balance the infeed error of RES. The balancing would imply that the PHEVs could be recharged from <b>emission</b> <b>free</b> sources, thereby enabling an <b>emission</b> <b>free</b> individual transportation sector. This paper focuses on the realization of an aggregated PHEV storage and the balancing of RES infeed errors. In specific, the paper investigates how a large fleet of PHEVs can be aggregated over a large, urban electricity distribution network and how this storage can be used to balance a wind infeed error while considering the limits of the underlying infrastructure. The balancing can be achieved through so called vehicle-to-gri...|$|E
