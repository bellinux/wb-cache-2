5|$|A promotional live-action tie-in web series/miniseries titled Bright Falls {{was made}} {{available}} a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> game's release {{on the web}} and the Xbox Live service. The six episodes of Bright Falls were co-written and directed by Phillip Van, and they serve as a prequel to the game, set in the eponymous town before Alan Wake arrives there. The main character in the series is Jake Fischer (played by Christopher Forsyth), a newspaper reporter who visits the town on business.|$|E
5|$|According to Viacom CEO Philipe Dauman, {{one quarter}} of The Beatles: Rock Band {{inventory}} was sold during its first week of release, exceeding their expectations. Based on current sales projections, Dauman claimed that the Limited Edition Premium bundle of the game could be sold out by November. Dauman attributed some success of the game's sales to the price reduction of the PlayStation 3, which occurred a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> release of The Beatles: Rock Band.|$|E
5|$|Camelot Software Planning spent between {{twelve and}} {{eighteen}} months developing Golden Sun, {{which is considered}} {{a long time for}} a handheld video game; the finished product was described as a testament to the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game. In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan. North American reviewers received the game a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a gripping RPG for the handheld.|$|E

5|$|John of Ibelin, who was {{the leader}} of Emperor Frederick's opponents in the kingdoms of Jerusalem and Cyprus, tried to {{convince}} Bohemond to support their cause. John sent his son, Balian, to Tripoli to negotiate with Bohemond, but the elderly Bohemond remained neutral in the conflict. Bohemond died in March 1233, a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> pope's confirmation of his treaty with the Hospitallers came to Tripoli. He was regarded as a great jurist by his contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|Robert Wood, the {{engineer}} who {{signed off on}} {{the engineer}}ing report declaring the mall structurally sound just a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> roof collapse, was charged with two counts of criminal negligence causing death and one count of criminal negligence causing bodily harm. According to the inquiry, Wood had previously indicated in conversation that he was aware that the roof was at risk of caving in, but altered his final report at Nazarian's request so that the structural issues did not jeopardize the building's refinancing. His trial began in September 2016.|$|E
5|$|First Class entered {{production}} in August 2010, with principal photography concluding in December and additional filming finishing in April 2011, just a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> film's premiere in June 2011. The tight schedule proved {{a challenge to}} the six companies responsible for the extensive visual effects, which included computer-generated sets and digital doubles for the actors. Locations included Oxford, the Mojave desert and Georgia, with soundstage work done in both Pinewood Studios and the 20th Century Fox stages in Los Angeles. The depiction of the 1960s drew inspiration from the James Bond films of the period.|$|E
50|$|Cocco {{was sold}} to Rovigo in a {{co-ownership}} deal in August 2008. In June 2009 Cagliari bought Cocco and Andrea Peana (from Triestina) back, but sold them to Alghero immediately in co-ownership deals (later Simone Aresti also joined), where Cocco also met ex-team-mate Alessio Cossu, Nicola Lai and Enrico Cotza (in January). In June 2010, <b>few</b> <b>week</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> bankrupt of Alghero, Cagliari bought back Cocco and Aresti for €500.|$|R

5|$|In {{preparation}} for the expedition, Champollion wrote the French Consul General Bernardino Drovetti for {{advice on how to}} secure permission from the Egyptian Khedive and Ottoman Viceroy Muhammad Ali of Egypt. Drovetti had initiated his own business of exporting plundered Egyptian antiques and did not want Champollion meddling in his affairs. He sent a letter discouraging the expedition stating that the political situation was too unstable for the expedition to be advisable. The letter reached Jacques Joseph Champollion a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> expedition was scheduled to leave, but he conveniently delayed in sending it on to his brother until after the expedition had left.|$|E
5|$|Led by Jim Peplinski, an alumni {{game was}} {{organized}} for Saturday, February 19, at McMahon. The game featured 14 {{members of the}} Flames' 1989 Stanley Cup championship team, including Lanny McDonald, Al MacInnis, Joel Otto, Theoren Fleury and Joe Nieuwendyk. For Nieuwendyk, {{at the time the}} General Manager of the Dallas Stars, the chance to participate in the game was important enough that he chose to overlook the chronic pain in his back when he is on skates. Immensely popular forward Craig Conroy, who retired only a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> game, also took part for Calgary.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln, however, did tacitly {{support the}} {{proposed}} Corwin Amendment to the Constitution, which passed Congress before Lincoln {{came into office}} and was then awaiting ratification by the states. That proposed amendment would have protected slavery in states where it already existed and would have guaranteed that Congress would not interfere with slavery without Southern consent. A <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> war, Lincoln {{sent a letter to}} every governor informing them Congress had passed a joint resolution to amend the Constitution. Lincoln was open to the possibility of a constitutional convention to make further amendments to the Constitution.|$|E

5|$|On 7 March 2015 The Veterans Charity {{unveiled}} a temporary monument at {{the crash site}} on the Green in Sutton Wick Lane. A Veterans Charity researcher working on a display of the crash, {{to be placed in}} Blackburn Beverley at Fort Paull, visited the site a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> anniversary and noted a lack of a local memorial at the site. So through the Charity, a memorial was rapidly ordered and efforts to locate survivors and families of those involved were made. Invitations were sent to local branches of the Royal British Legion, RAF Association, RAF Police Association, RAF Police, Thames Valley Police PCSOs and the Air Training Corps. Despite very short notice about 100 people attended, including two RAF Police NCOs from RAF Benson.|$|E
5|$|Servicing Mission 3A, {{flown by}} Discovery, {{took place in}} December 1999, and was a {{split-off}} from Servicing Mission 3 after three of the six onboard gyroscopes had failed. The fourth failed a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> mission, rendering the telescope incapable of performing scientific observations. The mission replaced all six gyroscopes, replaced a Fine Guidance Sensor and the computer, installed a Voltage/temperature Improvement Kit (VIK) to prevent battery overcharging, and replaced thermal insulation blankets. The new computer is 20 times faster, with six times more memory, than the DF-224 it replaced. It increases throughput by moving some computing tasks from the ground to the spacecraft and saves money by allowing the use of modern programming languages.|$|E
5|$|The {{world premiere}} of At World's End was held on May 19, 2007 at Disneyland, home of the ride that {{inspired}} the film and where the first two films in the trilogy debuted. Disneyland offered the general public a chance to attend the premiere through the sale of tickets, priced at $1,500 per ticket, with proceeds going to the Make-a-Wish Foundation charity. Just a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> film's release, Walt Disney Pictures decided to move the United States opening of At World's End from screenings Friday, May 25, 2007 to Thursday at 8 PM, May 24, 2007.

International District station was dedicated at a public open house during the annual Seafair on July 15, 1990. Bus service in the Downtown Seattle Transit Tunnel began on September 15, 1990, with several Metro bus routes moved into the tunnel from surface streets. The tunnel was served by dual-mode buses that would switch from diesel power to electric trolleybus (supplied by overhead wires) at International District station and Convention Place station, the tunnel's respective termini.|$|E
5|$|A <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> 2015 festival Foo Fighters {{frontman}} Dave Grohl {{fell off}} a stage during a show in Gothenburg and broke his leg, forcing their late withdrawal from the line-up. Florence and the Machine were moved from second-top on the bill to Friday's headliner, while Florence's vacant gap was filled by Reading & Leeds headliners The Libertines, and their performance was well received. Kanye West and The Who were the headliners for the Saturday and Sunday, respectively. Other notable acts who performed included Motörhead (their final festival appearance in the UK before Lemmy's death), Pharrell Williams, Deadmau5, Patti Smith, the Strypes, Lionel Richie, Catfish and the Bottlemen, Enter Shikari, the Chemical Brothers, Thee Faction, Alt-J, Paloma Faith, Mary J.

5|$|A <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> {{start of}} the {{services}} to Paddington the Bristol and Exeter Railway (B) had opened, on 14 June 1841, its trains reversing {{in and out of}} the GWR station. The third railway at Temple Meads was the Bristol and Gloucester Railway, which opened on 8 July 1844 and was taken over by the Midland Railway (MR) on 1 July 1845. This used the GWR platforms, diverging onto its own line on the far side of the bridge over the Floating Harbour. Both these new railways were engineered by Brunel and were initially broad gauge. Brunel also designed the Bristol and South Wales Union Railway, but this was not opened until 25 August 1863, nearly four years after his death. It terminated at Temple Meads.|$|E

5|$|After {{the sack}} of Constantinople in 1204 by Latin crusaders, two Byzantine {{successor}} states were established: the Empire of Nicaea, and the Despotate of Epirus. A third, the Empire of Trebizond, {{was created by}} Alexios I of Trebizond a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> sack of Constantinople. Of the three successor states, Epirus and Nicaea stood {{the best chance of}} reclaiming Constantinople. The Nicaean Empire struggled to survive the next few decades, however, and by the mid-13th century it had lost much of southern Anatolia. The weakening of the Sultanate of Rûm following the Mongol invasion in 1242–43 allowed many beyliks and ghazis to set up their own principalities in Anatolia, weakening the Byzantine hold on Asia Minor. In time, one of the Beys, Osman I, created an empire that would eventually conquer Constantinople. However, the Mongol invasion also gave Nicaea a temporary respite from Seljuk attacks, allowing it to concentrate on the Latin Empire to its north.|$|E
5|$|Between 11 March (Commonwealth Day) and 10 August 2002, {{as part of}} the {{preparations}} for the upcoming Commonwealth Games and to celebrate Her Majesty the Queen's Golden Jubilee, a national Spirit of Friendship Festival was organised. On 9 July, a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Games began, a sculpture outside the new national headquarters of the English Institute of Sport at SportCity was unveiled by the middle-distance runner, Steve Cram MBE. This sculpture, commissioned in late 2001, was created in a little over eight weeks by Altrincham-based artist, Colin Spofforth, who had submitted to Manchester City Council his idea for a heroic-sized sculpture of a sprinter as a means of celebrating the beauty, power and determination of the competing athletes. Reaching thirty feet high, weighing seven tonnes, and titled The Runner, this unique larger-than-life bronze statue of a male sprinter surmounting a bronze globe was, at the time, the United Kingdom's largest sporting sculpture. It depicts the very moment the runner leaves the blocks once the starter's gun has fired.|$|E
5|$|Cavendish {{was laid}} {{down at the}} Harland & Wolff {{shipyard}} in Belfast on 26 June 1916 and launched on 17 January 1918. In June she was renamed Vindictive, the fifth ship of that name in the RN, to perpetuate {{the name of the}} old protected cruiser , which had distinguished herself in the Zeebrugge Raid of April 1918 and had then been sunk as a blockship at Ostend in May. She commissioned on 1 October and, after briefly working up, joined the Grand Fleet's Flying Squadron on 18 October only a <b>few</b> <b>weeks</b> <b>before</b> <b>the</b> Armistice on 11 November. For {{the rest of the year}} she conducted flying trials and exercises, including those of the Port Victoria Grain Griffin reconnaissance aircraft, of which two were lost in accidents. The only landing aboard the ship was made by William Wakefield on 1 November in the fleet's last operational Sopwith Pup. Experiments conducted earlier aboard the larger , with a similarly intact superstructure and funnels, had demonstrated that the turbulence from these was enough to make successful landings almost impossible at high speed. Wakefield minimised the problem by approaching the landing deck at an angle with the ship slowly moving.|$|E
