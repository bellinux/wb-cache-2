Dampier and one or two of the men declared their certainty that there was ice near them, but, at least, they could not see it, though there was now no doubt about the crackling beneath the schooner's side. It was an anxious night for most of the crew, but a breeze that drove the haze aside got up with the sun, and Dampier expected to reach the creek before darkness fell.

25|$|Polypropylene {{is a major}} polymer used in nonwovens, {{with over}} 50% used for diapers or {{sanitary}} products where it is treated to absorb water (hydrophilic) rather than naturally repelling water (hydrophobic). Other interesting non-woven uses include filters for air, gas, and liquids in which the fibers can be formed into sheets or webs that can be pleated to form cartridges or layers that filter in various efficiencies in the 0.5 to 30 micrometre range. Such applications occur in houses as water filters or in air-conditioning-type filters. The high surface-area and naturally oleophilic polypropylene nonwovens are ideal absorbers of oil spills with the familiar <b>floating</b> <b>barriers</b> near oil spills on rivers.|$|R
40|$|For Presentation at Conference on Alternative Strategies for Desert Development and Management Sacramento, California May 31 - June 10, 1977 A {{summary of}} the leading methods of {{evaporation}} control is presented. Eight categories of evaporation control were discussed. The three leading categories of evaporation control discussed were the monolayer, {{the reduction of the}} surface-area-to volume method and <b>floating</b> vapor <b>barriers.</b> These methods are less expensive and appear to have a wider range of application than destratification, wind barriers, shading the water and <b>floating</b> reflective <b>barriers.</b> The other method of evaporation control discussed was the use of sand or rock-filled reservoirs. This method was found to be effective but limited to smaller size reservoirs. The use of fatty alcohol to form monolayers will work on larger reservoirs using either the airplane or a pipeline carrying the alcohol in slurry or an emulsified form. An airplane was used to distribute alcohol on the 12, 000 hectare Vaal Dam in Africa during an extreme drought. The estimated cost was 0. 021 /m 3. The method is less cost-effective on smaller reservoirs due to rapid removal of the material by the wind. The reduction of surface-to-volume ratio can be accomplished through the use of proper site selection or if in flat terrain through the use of the compartmented reservoir. The concept of the compartmented reservoir can be used on existing reservoirs but more easily on new ones since it involves the use of construction equipment. The proper use of the compartmented reservoir concept should result in a lower unit cost of water saved than any other presently known evaporation control method. The use of <b>floating</b> vapor <b>barriers</b> of foamed rubber or wax-impregnated expanded polystyrene seemed to have a wider range of use than other <b>floating</b> vapor <b>barriers.</b> The recent development of the wax-impregnated expanded polystyrene for evaporation control is described. The paper describes it {{to be one of the}} most promising <b>floating</b> vapor <b>barriers</b> in terms of cost effectiveness and weatherability. Developed at the University of Arizona, this material can be used in large 1. 2 x 2. 4 m sheets connected together by couplers or rubber straps or as smaller floating squares that would be less prone to vandalism. There is considerable merit to the use of the compartmented system with a <b>floating</b> vapor <b>barrier</b> in the "last" compartment to have water in it. This should increase the dependable water from a compartmented system at a relatively low cost...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present a {{mathematical}} model and its numerical treatment to forecast oil spills trajectories in the sea. The knowledge of the trajectory followed by an oil slick spilled on the sea is of fundamental importance in the estimation of potential risks and in combating the pollution using <b>floating</b> <b>barriers,</b> detergents, etc. In order to estimate these slicks trajectories a new model, based on mass and momentum conservation equations, is presented. This model considers the spreading in the regime when the inertial and viscous forces counterbalance gravity and takes into account the effects of winds and water currents. The mass loss caused by oil evaporation is also considered. The numerical model is developed in generalized coordinates, making the model easily applicable to complex coastal geographies...|$|R

Swimming and fishing were prohibited in the Chaudière River, as was the use of scarce municipal water to fill swimming pools or water flower beds. Restrictions on drawing potable water from the river remained in effect two months later.

In this paper, we shall present some recent results of the model obtained with a direct approach. This direct solution procedure enables us to quantitatively discuss the relationship among three important physical parameters, the Froude number, F, the barrier submergence depth, l, and the amount of oil trapped by the barrier, q. Although a further upgrading of our model to somehow incorporate the shear stress on the oil-water interface appears to be necessary, the complexity involved in such upgrading warrants the current model as an initial step in our modelling exercises of this complicated flow phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|Large {{drinking}} water storage reservoirs are {{a critical component}} for the supply of quality water. With a growing population and limited resources water managers are required to seek efficient and effective methods to ensure a secure and adequate water supply. It is certainly evident that it is becoming difficult to secure and develop new dam sites (both on environmental and engineering grounds) and that new sources of fresh water (such as desalination) are costly and not environmentally sensitive. In south east Queensland up to 1 / 3 of freshwater is lost through evaporation, so it seems sensible to seek solutions to reduce such losses in a sustainable manner. This paper will examine three different evaporation reduction techniques - hard covers (eg. <b>floating</b> <b>barriers),</b> destratification and wind reduction devices (eg. windbreaks). A simple onedimensional model was adapted to investigate the effectiveness of each technique for large storages. It was found {{that each of the}} techniques has it limitations for large storages, but that it appears the application of hard covers is the most efficient solution.

Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is being used to study the catch efficiency debris of different sizes and densities, the transport of plastic along the containment boom, and the forces acting on it {{in order to determine the}} appropriate shape for their passive barrier concept.

The objective of this PRACE project is to simulate the flow dynamic around the buoyancy body and the flexible skirt as well as the interaction of the plastic debris with the skirt. This simulation is a very strong multi-physics coupled problem carried out by Alya code: Navier-stokes equations in a turbulence regime, free surface, solid mechanics and particle Lagrangian transport have to be solved.
