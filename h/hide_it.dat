The author of the work criticised the royal justices, calling them greedy. It sets out elaborate procedures for the conduct of murder cases, or murdum.|$|E
5|$|During {{a grocery}} {{shopping}} trip, Lois realizes she is short on {{money to pay}} for food. She pretends to return a ham to the meat department but decides to <b>hide</b> <b>it</b> in her purse instead. Hooked on the thrill of shoplifting, she begins stealing other items, quickly becoming addicted to theft. She begins to indulge in large shoplifting sprees, including stealing a Matisse painting, which arouses the suspicion of Brian. While attempting to steal from an auto parts store, Lois is caught by Brian, who tells her she is doing wrong and that her stealing is not going to solve problems.

5|$|During {{production}} of the first series, Macfadyen, along with co stars Keeley Hawes and David Oyelowo were wary of playing the lead characters in their mid-twenties, but since felt they {{earned the right to}} be in the series. During {{production of}} episodes three and five of the first series, Macfadyen burst a blood vessel on one of his eyes. Macfadyen compensated by wearing sunglasses in order to <b>hide</b> <b>it.</b> Halfway through filming series two, Macfadyen got to carry a gun {{for the first time in}} the series; he was disappointed in not carrying one in the first series.|$|E

5|$|The Deltas are despondent, but Bluto rallies {{them with}} an impassioned, if {{historically}} inaccurate, speech ("Was it over when the Germans bombed Pearl Harbor? Hell no!"), and so they decide {{to take action against}} Wormer, the Omegas, and the college. They convert Flounder's damaged car into an armored vehicle and <b>hide</b> <b>it</b> inside a cake-shaped breakaway float in order to sneak into the annual homecoming parade. As they wreak havoc on the event, the futures of several of the student main characters are revealed using freeze-frame labels. Most of the Deltas become respectable professionals, while their adversaries suffer less fortunate outcomes.|$|E
5|$|Susan and David {{defy the}} group and go check on Mr. Griffin. The two find him dead {{as a result of}} {{coronary}} arrest after being unable to take his medication for angina. Mark convinces {{the rest of the group}} to cover up the death. He instructs Susan, who was the last one known to the police to see Mr. Griffin, to tell them Mr. Griffin kept looking at his watch during the conference and left with a pretty woman. Jeff, Mark, and David bury the body in the mountains. Betsy and David also drive Mr. Griffin's car to the airport, but the officer who gave Betsy a ticket sees her there. Worried that the officer might later identify the car as Mr. Griffin's, Jeff and Betsy move the car into Jeff's garage so he can repaint it before they <b>hide</b> <b>it</b> elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Those {{in favour}} of viewing the objects as the {{personal}} hoard of Athanaric suggest that the gold was buried {{in an attempt to}} <b>hide</b> <b>it</b> from the Huns, who had defeated the Gothic Greuthungi north of the Black Sea and began moving down into Thervingian Dacia around 375. However, it remains unclear why the gold would have remained buried, as Athanaric's treaty with Theodosius I (380) enabled him to bring his tribesmen under the protection of Roman rule prior to his death in 381. Other researchers have suggested that the hoard was that of an Ostrogothic king, with Rusu (1984) specifically identifying Gainnas, a Gothic general in the Roman army who was killed by the Huns around 400, as the owner of the hoard. Although this would help explain why the hoard remained buried, it fails to account for the conspicuous ring-barrow having been chosen as the site to hide such a large and valuable treasure.|$|E

5|$|During the Second World War Trafford Park {{was largely}} {{turned over to}} the {{production}} of mat√©riel, including the Avro Manchester heavy bomber, and the Rolls-Royce Merlin engines used to power both the Spitfire and the Lancaster. That resulted in Stretford being the target for heavy bombing, particularly during the Manchester Blitz of 1940. On the nights of 22/23 and 23/24 December 1940 alone, 124incendiaries and 120high-explosive bombs fell on the town, killing 73 people and injuring many more. Among the buildings damaged or destroyed during the war were Manchester United's Old Trafford football ground, All Saints' Church, St Hilda's Church, and the children's library in King Street. Smoke generators were set up in the north of the town close to Trafford Park in an effort to <b>hide</b> <b>it</b> from enemy aircraft, and 11,900 children were evacuated to safer areas in Lancashire, Cheshire, Derbyshire, and Staffordshire, along with their teachers and supervisors. A memorial to those residents who lost their lives in the bombing was erected in Stretford Cemetery in 1948, over the communal grave of the 17unidentified people who were killed in the blitz of December 1940.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{hard times}} follow, with the Autobots {{becoming}} a corrupt galactic police force. While shutting down an Energon-mining operation, they incite a riot by beating an outspoken miner to death. The riot is extinguished, {{resulting in the}} miners either dead or imprisoned. A surviving miner, Megatron, manages {{to take over a}} prison shuttle and <b>hide</b> <b>it</b> in Kaon, the seediest city on Cybertron. Megatron makes a name for himself in the underground gladiatorial matches, learning to enjoy the kill. He recruits the Seekers, Soundwave, and the future Cassetticons to perform acts of terrorism throughout Cybertron. Megatron rallies a large group of gladiators and proposes for them to unite under the same badge, but they are caught and arrested by Sentinel Prime's police force. However, this is part of Megatron's plan, as Starscream kills the Autobot Senate. Megatron kills Sentinel Prime, and the newly forged Decepticons take over the city-state of Kaon, heralding the beginning of the war. The populace at large is distracted by mass sports race games, with racers like the arrogant but talented Blurr becoming celebrities. Early on during the war, both Autobot and Decepticon try to recruit Blurr to their cause, with a young Optimus talking Blurr into saving the life of Zeta Prime from Starscream's assassination squad. A rookie Tracks is saved from the elite Predacons by special ops soldier Jazz. In later years, Tracks passes on the story of the lone Autobot to boost morale in times of crisis.|$|E

25|$|It is kept {{together}} with an inventory list on vellum, said to date from AD 262, that accompanied a lost letter which detailed state-sponsored Roman persecution of Christians that forced the church to split up its treasury and <b>hide</b> <b>it</b> with members, specifically the deacon Saint Lawrence.

25|$|In 1992, the convicted {{serial killer}} Kenneth Bianchi, {{one-half}} of the pair known as the Hillside Stranglers, sued Yronwode for 8.5 million dollars for having an image of his face depicted on a trading card; he claimed his face was his trademark. The judge dismissed the case after ruling that, if Bianchi had been using his face as a trademark when he was killing women, {{he would not have}} tried to <b>hide</b> <b>it</b> from the police.|$|E

He gets <b>it</b> back and <b>hides</b> <b>it</b> again, in his neighbours house, Mr. Marks finds it again, but thinks {{that it is just}} one similar to his own. William gets in a muddle as he <b>hides</b> <b>it,</b> and eventually gives it (twice) to Mr. Marks. In the end, when Mr. Marks finds out that there was only one all along, he turns to ask William about it - but he's gone.|$|R

25|$|The {{experience}} in northern Ireland gave Barkas {{the idea that}} every theatre of war is naturally patterned. When an army unit goes {{against the grain of}} the pattern, he reasoned, it becomes conspicuous; to <b>hide,</b> <b>it</b> has to go with the pattern. He developed a simple illustration of this point, by dropping a collar stud on a carpet. When it fell on a plain area, it was easy to see; when in a patterned area, it had to be searched for.|$|E
25|$|Basophils are chiefly {{responsible}} for allergic and antigen response by releasing the chemical histamine causing the dilation of blood vessels. Because {{they are the}} rarest of the white blood cells (less than 0.5% of the total count) and share physicochemical properties with other blood cells, they are difficult to study. They can be recognized by several coarse, dark violet granules, giving them a blue hue. The nucleus is bi- or tri-lobed, {{but it is hard}} to see because of the number of coarse granules that <b>hide</b> <b>it.</b>|$|E
