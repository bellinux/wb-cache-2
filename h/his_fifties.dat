5|$|After his retirement, Barber played club cricket into <b>his</b> <b>fifties,</b> {{playing for}} Lidget Green and King Cross until 1952. He {{went on to}} play for Mirfield in the Central Yorkshire League between 1952 and 1955. There, he was the club's first {{professional}} once it reformed in 1952. During his time at the club, Barber scored eleven half centuries and won an award for his batting. After he left Mirfield, he became coach to the North Riding Educational Authorities, later working as coach and groundsman at a school in Harrogate. He died, aged 67, in a hospital in Bradford after a short illness, on 10 September 1968.|$|E

5|$|In <b>his</b> <b>fifties,</b> Elgar {{composed}} a symphony and a violin concerto that were immensely successful. His second symphony and his cello concerto did not gain immediate public popularity and took {{many years to}} achieve a regular place in the concert repertory of British orchestras. Elgar's music came, in his later years, {{to be seen as}} appealing chiefly to British audiences. His stock remained low for a generation after his death. It began to revive significantly in the 1960s, helped by new recordings of his works. Some of his works have, in recent years, been taken up again internationally, but the music continues to be played more in Britain than elsewhere.|$|E
5|$|Miller had a light {{workload}} in the 1947–48 home Test {{series against}} India, {{who were on}} their first tour to Australia. India were well beaten, losing 4–0, {{three of the four}} defeats by an innings. Miller was required to bat just once in each Test, accumulating 185runs at 37.00, including two half-centuries, while the batsmen ahead of him plundered the bowling. His bowling duties were also light; his 72overs yielded nine wickets at 24.78. In both <b>his</b> <b>fifties,</b> Miller featured in century partnerships with his partners, respectively Bradman and Hassett in the First and Fourth test respectively. His 58 in the First Test at Brisbane featured many big hits.|$|E

He drifted in and out of public mention but eventually died in Chicago during the winter of 1912 (age 72) in deep poverty after suffering a stroke. Buffalo Bill paid for his friend's headstone at Mount Greenwood Cemetery (111 Street and Sacramento) on Chicago's far south side.|$|E

5|$|Djedkare {{was buried}} in a pyramid in Saqqara named Nefer Djedkare ("Djedkare is perfect"), which is now ruined owing to theft of stone from its outer casing during antiquity. The burial chamber still held Djedkare's mummy when it was {{excavated}} in the 1940s. Examinations of the mummy revealed that he died in <b>his</b> <b>fifties.</b> Following his death, Djedkare was {{the object of a}} cult that lasted at least {{until the end of the}} Old Kingdom. He seemed to have been held in particularly high esteem during the mid-Sixth Dynasty, whose pharaohs lavished rich offerings on his cult. Archaeological evidence suggests the continuing existence of this funerary cult throughout the much later New Kingdom period (c. 1550–1077 BC). Djedkare was also remembered by the Ancient Egyptians as the king of vizier Ptahhotep, the purported author of The Maxims of Ptahhotep, one of the earliest pieces of philosophic wisdom literature.|$|E
5|$|Wilfred Rhodes (29 October 1877– 8 July 1973) was an English {{professional}} cricketer {{who played}} 58 Test matches for England between 1899 and 1930. In Tests, Rhodes took 127 wickets and scored 2,325 runs, {{becoming the first}} Englishman to complete the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in Test matches. He holds the world records both for the most appearances made in first-class cricket (1,110 matches), {{and for the most}} wickets taken (4,204). He completed the double of 1,000 runs and 100 wickets in an English cricket season a record 16 times. Rhodes played for Yorkshire and England into <b>his</b> <b>fifties,</b> and in his final Test in 1930 was, at 52 years and 165 days, the oldest player who has appeared in a Test match.|$|E
5|$|Honours {{continued}} to come Yardley's {{way in the}} 1938 season. He was chosen to captain Cambridge in his final season in the team; although his side did not win a match, Yardley enjoyed some personal success. Among <b>his</b> <b>fifties</b> were innings of 67 against the touring Australian team and 61 in the University Match. He was included in different representative sides; he was selected in a Test trial, playing for the Rest, and played a second game against the Australians for the Gentlemen of England, {{although he did not}} pass fifty in either match. For the Gentlemen against the Players, Yardley scored 88. He did not make the full England side but was twelfth man in two Tests against Australia. His highest innings of the season was 97 for Yorkshire against Gloucestershire, and in all first-class matches, Yardley accumulated 1,217 runs at an average of 31.20 and took 22 wickets at 35.45.|$|E

5|$|Off-stage, Robey led {{an active}} {{lifestyle}} {{and was a}} keen amateur sportsman. He {{was proud of his}} healthy physique and maintained it by performing frequent exercise and following a careful diet. By the time he was in his mid-thirties, he had played as an amateur against Millwall, Chelsea and Fulham football clubs. He organised and played in many charity football matches throughout England, which were described by the sporting press as being of a very high standard, and he remained an active football player well into <b>his</b> <b>fifties.</b> Robey became associated with cricket by 1895 when he led a team of amateur players for a match at Turney Road in Dulwich. In September 1904, while appearing in Hull, he was asked by the cricketer Harry Wrathall {{to take part in a}} charity cricket match at the Yorkshire County Cricket Club. Robey played so well that Wrathall asked him to return the following Saturday to take part in a professional game. That weekend, while waiting in the pavilion before the game, Robey was approached by an agent for Hull City A.F.C., who asked the comedian to play in a match that same afternoon. Robey agreed, swapped his cricket flannels for a football kit and played with the team against Nottingham Forest as an inside right.|$|E
25|$|After his {{retirement}} from Test and first-class cricket, Bardsley would briefly {{serve as a}} national selector. He continued to play club cricket for Glebe into <b>his</b> <b>fifties.</b> This longevity was attributed to rigorous exercise, and abstaining from alcohol and tobacco.|$|E
