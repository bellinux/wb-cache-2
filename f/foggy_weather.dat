5|$|The <b>foggy</b> <b>weather</b> made it {{difficult}} to see positions from either side, but Frederick and his commanders used the fog to their advantage. Leaving a cavalry unit and a cluster of infantry in front of the northernmost end of the Austrian line (the Austrian right), Frederick deployed the remainder (and bulk) of his forces toward Leuthen itself; Charles saw them start their redeployment, and may have interpreted the maneuver as withdrawal, at least for a while.|$|E
5|$|On 10 August 1959, a B-52 {{crashed in}} the Spruce Swamp at Fremont, New Hampshire. The bomber {{was on a}} routine {{training}} mission from Chicopee, Massachusetts, when its air speed indicator and altimeter failed, which led to more serious malfunctions. The B-52 was attempting to make an emergency landing at Goose Bay, Labrador, Canada, the only landing option not affected by <b>foggy</b> <b>weather</b> conditions. However, it crashed before making the landing. The U.S. Air Force reported {{that it was the}} first B-52 crash where the entire crew survived; the crew parachuted to safety.

5|$|Kapitän zur See Otto von Diederichs took {{command of}} the ship in 1889. Sachsen {{took part in a}} {{goodwill}} visit to Portsmouth {{to take part in the}} Cowes Regatta. Following the trip to England, Sachsen and the rest of the fleet conducted the annual summer exercises. At 15:45 on 27 February 1890, Sachsen ran aground outside Kiel in <b>foggy</b> <b>weather.</b> The grounding dented the bottom of the hull and tore it open. However, on 2 March, the ship was able to get underway at high tide. Repairs lasted for two weeks. In 1891, the German navy stopped the practice of deactivating the fleet in the winter months and instead kept the front-line units on permanent active duty. The fleet was also reorganized, to form two four-ship divisions. Sachsen and her sisters were assigned to the I Division, under the command of Admiral Hans von Koester. Annual fleet training cruises were conducted in April. The summer fleet maneuvers, which occurred during mid-August to mid-September, up through 1894 were always centered on defensive actions in the North and Baltic seas.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1927, new {{regulations}} came into effect {{which meant that}} aircraft carrying 10 or more passengers would have to carry a radio operator {{in addition to the}} pilot. In February it was reported that a Notice to Airmen had been issued stating that aircraft coming from the Continent in conditions of poor visibility in which the radio was not functioning correctly should land at Lympne, where repair facilities were available. In April it was reported that a new wireless station was being built at Lympne and in May it was notified that the night light was again in operation at Lympne. In July, a new system was introduced for civil aircraft flying in bad visibility between Lympne and Croydon. They were not to follow the normal Lympne–Edenbridge–Caterham–Croydon route, but instead follow one of three notified alternate routes. Aircraft were to be notified by radio whenever such conditions were declared to be put into effect, or whenever the weather had improved. This was aimed at preventing mid-air collisions between civil aircraft and those operated by the Royal Air Force. From 7 to 21 August, 600 (City of London) Squadron AuxAF and 601 (County of London) Squadron AuxAF were both at Lympne on their annual camp. The squadrons were flying Avro 504N and de Havilland DH.9A aircraft. In October, a Notice to Airmen announced that the ground signals at Lympne would be displayed in a different arrangement than previously, standardisation of ground signals worldwide required the change which came into effect on 1 October. In December, a Notice to Airmen informed that in <b>foggy</b> <b>weather</b> the position of Lympne would be indicated by flares fired from the ground, to be seen by aircraft flying in the vicinity. Colour was to be at the discretion of the Civil Air Traffic Officer. The Notice to Airmen was quickly amended to state that the firing of red flares would be reserved to indicate that an aircraft was being instructed not to land at the airfield in question. In 1927 a Fokker F.VII of SABENA flew newspapers to Lympne.|$|E
25|$|Within {{hours of}} the crash, UTair issued a {{statement}} saying that the aircraft had been in good technical condition and that <b>foggy</b> <b>weather</b> was likely to have caused the accident.

500|$|Fog {{cancelled}} Indefatigables flying {{operations on}} 23 August, including a planned diversionary attack against German shipping in Langfjord. The other two carriers and their escorts rejoined Moore and Indefatigable off Norway {{during the morning}} of 24 August. While conditions that day were initially <b>foggy,</b> the <b>weather</b> cleared enough in the afternoon to permit a strike against Kaafjord. The attacking force comprised 33 Barracudas carrying [...] armour-piecing bombs, 24 Corsairs (including 5 armed with a 1,000-pound [...] bomb), 10 Hellcats, 10 Fireflies and 8 Seafires. In an attempt to achieve surprise, the aircraft flew off from the carriers from a point further {{to the south of}} those used in previous raids. The strike aircraft then flew parallel to the coast, before making landfall and approaching Kaafjord from the south. A German radar station detected the force at 3:41 pm, and immediately alerted Tirpitz.|$|R
5000|$|Recreation Park, {{located in}} the Mission District , was the best known and longest-lived of these ballparks. It was {{the home of the}} Seals during 1907-13 and then 1915-30 after a one-year {{experiment}} playing at newly built Ewing Park near the Richmond District. The experiment was a fiasco, largely because of the cold and <b>foggy</b> summer <b>weather</b> endemic to western San Francisco. The Oaks, in turn, had essentially moved into Recreation Park in 1907 and played most of their games there (except Thursdays and Sunday mornings) until their new Oaks Park was opened in 1913, although they continued to play some games in San Francisco until sometime in the 1920s. This congenial arrangement was made easier by the fact that J. Cal Ewing, founding father of the PCL, owned both clubs for their first couple of decades. The ballpark sat 15,000. It also become the home of the Mission Reds (a.k.a. [...] "Missions") upon their arrival in 1926.|$|R
5000|$|Weather {{patterns}} in the Sacramento Valley {{are very similar to}} those in the San Joaquin Valley to the south, although the humidity and precipitation tends to be a bit higher. Summers are the dry season, with average daytime temperatures in the upper 80s to mid 90s but triple digits are a common occurrence, especially in the Chico, Redding and Red Bluff area. The [...] "breeze", which comes in from the Bay area, brings cooler temperatures and higher humidity. At times the delta breeze is gusty with wind speed to up to 30 mph in valley and up to 45 mph in the delta region which is always breezy. This breeze can also bring morning low clouds at times into the region but the clouds generally burn off quickly and temperatures stay cool. Summer-like conditions continue into early to mid September but weather starts to change to cooler, wetter, <b>foggier</b> <b>weather</b> during October which gives trees vibrant autumn foliage. Winters, also known as the rainy season, are generally mild to cool, foggy and wet with highs averaging in the mid 40s F to low 10s F, colder {{in the northern part of}} the valley and colder still in the foothills and frost can occur almost anywhere. The rainy season runs from October to April but it's not unusual for rain to occur in September or May. During the rainy season, the Sacramento Valley is prone to strong thunderstorms and tornadoes, mostly of EF0 or EF1 intensity, especially in Colusa County and areas around Corning and Orland. Flooding does occur at times during wetter periods, usually November to March. Snow in the valley is rare, although Redding and Red Bluff, being at the north end of the valley, often experience a light dusting or two per year. Chico may get a rain-snow mix every few years, but, on the average, only snows about every 5 years. Farther south in Sacramento, snow falls about once every 10 years or so. During the autumn and winter months the entire Central Valley is susceptible to dense tule fog that makes driving hazardous, especially at night and especially south of Corning. The fog can last for weeks depending on how weak the wind is.|$|R

25|$|The Spanish {{conquest of}} the San Francisco Bay area came later than to Southern California. San Francisco's {{characteristic}} <b>foggy</b> <b>weather</b> and geography led early European explorers such as Juan Rodríguez Cabrillo to bypass the Golden Gate and miss entering San Francisco Bay, although it seems clear from historical accounts of navigation that they passed close to the coastline {{north and south of}} the Golden Gate.|$|E
25|$|The {{main cause}} {{for a long}} spell of dry weather in the United Kingdom is usually a {{blocking}} anticyclone (often the Azores high) system that forces other low pressure systems around it, usually to the northwest. This can happen any time of year, but brings hot sunny weather in summer and dry, cold and <b>foggy</b> <b>weather</b> in winter. This is why in dry spells the northwest of the United Kingdom actually often receives above average rainfall, as depressions and associated fronts are pushed towards the north.|$|E

25|$|The {{aircraft}} and crew were assigned a VIP transport mission to RAF Reykjavik, specifically to transport Prince George, Duke of Kent to Iceland. The aircraft departed from a seaplane base at RAF Invergordon on the Cromarty Firth at 1305 GMT on Sunday 25 August 1942 into <b>foggy</b> <b>weather.</b> The Sunderland (flying on instruments) veered off its flight plan track {{and crashed into}} the remote Eagle's Rock at 13:42 GMT. The official board of inquiry concluded that the plane crashed into the hillside due to an error of navigation; i.e. {{there was not enough}} allowance made for wind that caused the aircraft to drift off its planned track up the eastern coast of Scotland. Fourteen of the fifteen crew and passengers, including the Duke of Kent, perished in the crash.|$|E
25|$|In 1998, {{the general}} {{decided to run}} for {{governor}} of the Krasnoyarsk Krai (the second largest region in Russia), wanting {{to get out of the}} politics in Moscow after his ouster from the Yeltsin administration.

There was speculation that he would run for the presidency in 2000, with Moscow mayor Yuri Luzhkov being projected as his main opponent at that time. However, in 2000 Lebed decided against running for president because he was satisfied with his position as the governor of Krasnoyarsk Krai.

25|$|The Hurricanes {{were formed}} to {{represent}} the lower North Island with the conception of the Super 12 competition in 1996, which featured teams from New Zealand, South Africa and Australia. The Hurricanes had a poor first season, but rebounded in 1997 with a third placing. The team did not reach the play-offs for another five years as the team struggled in the bottom four of the table. Since 2003 the Hurricanes have made the post-season play-offs seven times {{out of the last}} fourteen seasons; including the 2006 final, which they lost in horrendously <b>foggy</b> <b>weather</b> against the Crusaders 19–12.

5000|$|Before the {{offensive}} the Allies were virtually blind to German troop movement. During {{the liberation of}} France, the extensive network of the French resistance had provided valuable intelligence about German dispositions. Once they reached the German border, this source dried up. In France, orders had been relayed within the German army using radio messages enciphered by the Enigma machine, and these could be picked up and decrypted by Allied code-breakers headquartered at Bletchley Park, to give the intelligence known as Ultra. In Germany such orders were typically transmitted using telephone and teleprinter, and a special radio silence order was imposed on all matters concerning the upcoming offensive. The major crackdown in the Wehrmacht after the 20 July plot to assassinate Hitler resulted in much tighter security and fewer leaks. The <b>foggy</b> autumn <b>weather</b> also prevented Allied reconnaissance aircraft from correctly assessing the ground situation. German units assembling in the area were even issued charcoal instead of wood for cooking fires {{to cut down on}} smoke and reduce chances of Allied observers deducing a troop buildup was underway.|$|R
50|$|Yevgraf Kruten {{was born}} into a family with a {{military}} tradition; both his father and his mother's father were colonels. He entered the world on 29 December 1890 in Kiev. In 1901, aged 11, he attended the Kiev Military Cadet Corps School. He was forwarded to horse artillery in 1908 as an ensign. In 1911, he was commissioned with the rank of podporuchik upon graduation from Konstantin Artillery School. In April 1912, he was transferred to Kiev. He was selected in June 1913 for a study of the potential use of heavier-than-air by the Imperial Russian Army. The test of five airplanes was conducted by the leader of the pilot contingent at Brovary, Pyotr Nesterov. Kruten was required to fly as part of Russia's maiden attempt at artillery spotting. The several flights he took sparked his interest. He found his way to the Third Air Company, which was located at Sviatoshyn Airfield in Kiev near his duty station. By August 1913, he was flying as an aerial observer in military maneuvers. He made six flights in <b>foggy</b> rainy <b>weather</b> with Nesterov, including one at night. As a result of his friendship with Nesterov, the aviator wrote a letter recommending Kruten's admission to aviation training.|$|R
25|$|Braathens SAFE {{conducted}} {{its first}} landing {{at the airport}} on 9 May 1952, using a de Havilland Heron aircraft. Regular services to Oslo Airport, Fornebu commenced on 18 August 1953. The airline marketed itself with having a much more central airport than SAS, allowing for shorter travel times than those traveling via Værnes. The lack of a hard landing surface caused seasonal disruptions in operations and in rainy periods Braathens SAFE had to reroute its services to Værnes. As the aircraft also had to use visual flight rules, during <b>foggy</b> <b>weather</b> it was also forced to land at Værnes. During the period that Braathens operated at Lade, it had the responsibility for local air traffic control. Passengers were checked in at the reception of Hotel Astoria in the city center and then bused to the airport. At first there were three weekly round services, increasing to a daily except Saturday service from May 1954. The route had 3900 in 1953. Braathens moved their Lade services to Værnes in 1956, as Lade {{was not able to}} accommodate their new, larger Fokker F-27 Friendship aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The third (and final) {{practice}} session was delayed three times for 45 minutes {{from its original}} start time because <b>foggy</b> <b>weather</b> conditions prevented the medical helicopter from flying and was initially held on a damp track, although some light rain fell towards the session's end. Cars were equipped with intermediate tyres to start the session before switching to dry slick tyres when the track dried up. Webber set the fastest timed lap at one minute and 41.002 seconds with twenty minutes of practice remaining, and was nearly three-tenths of a second faster than Anthony Davidson in Toyota's No. 5 car. Duval spun the No. 8 Audi at the second turn late in the session. Rast was the fastest LMP2 driver with a lap of one minute and 50.260 seconds in the session's final minute, nearly seven-tenths of a second quicker than Graves in Manor's No. 44 car. Gianmaria Bruni recorded the quickest time in LMGTE Pro, driving the No. 51 AF Corse Ferrari, while David Heinemeier Hansson in the No. 88 Abu Dhabi-Proton Racing vehicle was the fastest driver in LMGTE Am, despite spinning his car in the session's closing minutes.|$|E
500|$|Training {{conditions}} {{aboard the}} ship {{were less than}} ideal throughout the voyage. Rough seas for parts of the journey hampered training and contributed to widespread seasickness. Although the long distance runners were able to practice by making multiple circuits of the ship, the sprinters and hurdlers were provided only a [...] cork track—two-thirds {{the length of the}} shortest track event at the games—on which to practice. Javelins were tethered by rope and aimed by their throwers at the sea, and, when thrown, would often come down in unexpected locations. The only facility for swimmers was a canvas saltwater tank set up on the lower deck; the tank split when filled for the first time. Even after it was repaired, the best the swimmers could do was to practice strokes while tied to the corner of the tank with a rope, and divers, with no other facilities available, were allocated just a few minutes a day in the tank. Conditions on the ship contributed to several injuries to athletes. During <b>foggy</b> <b>weather,</b> American decathlete Everett Ellis fell on the slippery deck, suffering a bad sprain, and shot putter Pat McDonald sprained his thumb while tossing a medicine ball on the pitching deck.|$|E

30|$|A PV {{solar pump}} was also tested for {{irrigation}} in Bangladesh Agricultural Research Institute, Gazipur during eighties. Solar pumps were found technically suitable for low lift small-scale irrigation. Solar pumps were not then found economically viable {{due to high}} PV cost. Moreover, these photovoltaic solar panels could not function during cloudy, <b>foggy</b> and rainy <b>weathers</b> [13]. Sometimes, in winter and rainy seasons, several days to week sun is {{not found in the}} sky (no effective solar radiation) in Bangladesh and solar pump cannot be operated. This problem may be effectively solved introducing high integrated hybrid system (HIHS) in continuous operation of solar pump. Leva and Zaninelli [14] studied the hybrid photovoltaic–wind–diesel generation systems supplying a remote power load considering the advantages of sustainable energy from the economic point of view. They also introduced a fuel cell generation device in a photovoltaic–wind existing plant for supplying telecommunication apparatus. HIHS (photovoltaic, wind diesel) is found technically, economically and environmentally suitable for operation of telecommunication devices [15, 16].|$|R
5000|$|Prey {{is caught}} while flying along fixed routes at low heights and {{constant}} low speeds (c. 30 kph mph), as {{is typical of}} harriers. The flight is considered lighter and more dexterous than other harriers enabling it to take more agile prey. When possible it often follows the edges of various vegetation to catch its prey by surprise. This is taken after a short stoop, though fast running animals and flying birds can be chased over a short distance. [...] During the breeding season, the male will provision the female and later the young with food. The rate of provisioning increases from 5 to 6 times per day during incubation to 7 to 10 times per day when young have hatched, though the male can be handicapped by wet, <b>foggy</b> or windy <b>weather.</b> In a manner typical of harriers, prey is passed between partners in the air: The female flies underneath the male, who drops the prey for her to catch. The male hunts over a large area up to 12 km away from the nest. The female hunts closer to the nest, up to 1 km away, and only after the young have hatched.|$|R

50|$|Live Oak's climate usually {{consists}} of hot, dry summers and prolonging wet, cool winters, a Mediterranean climate. Summers are hot, sunny and dry but a delta breeze occurs at times. This cools the temperature but doesn't last long. Heat waves occur {{during the summer}} months, lasting for 3-5 days on average. Temperatures range from 105 to 110 degrees. Dry months range from mid to late May to early to mid September where rainfall is rare. The hottest month is July with temperatures averaging around 96 to 100 degrees with no rain but it isn't rare for some rain to arrive from the Southwest Monsoon. Winters are prolonging wet, cool and foggy. Wet months range from mid October to mid April where rainfall becomes constant. January is the wettest and coolest month with rainfall averaging between 4 and 6 inches but during El Niño season, rainfall averages 10 to 12 inches which causes major flooding. During the La Niña season, rainfall averages 4 inches or below, causing drought problems during summer.

5000|$|All boxes could {{communicate}} with adjacent boxes by their block telegraph. Signals were normally kept at 'all clear' but {{were set to}} 'danger' to protect trains as follows. When a train entered a block by passing a home signal, the signalman would set the home signal to 'danger', thus preventing a following train entering the same block. The distant would also be set to 'danger'. Trains were required to stop at a home signal at 'danger' but were allowed to pass a distant signal at 'danger', this merely warning the driver of an approaching train to moderate his speed so that the train could be stopped at the home signal. Both signals would be returned to 'all clear' when the next box telegraphed 'line clear'. Normally, {{as soon as a}} train was past a box's home signal, the signalman would telegraph 'line clear' to the preceding box. During <b>foggy</b> or snowy <b>weather,</b> however, when a train stopped at a station 'line clear' was not sent until the train had restarted, or been shunted into a siding. In good weather therefore a goods train being shunted into a siding at Abbots Ripton should have been protected against another train running into it by the Abbots Ripton 'home' and 'distant' signals in falling snow, the home and distant signals of the previous box should have given further protection and the fast train should always have been at least one full block away.|$|R
