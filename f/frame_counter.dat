30|$|The TEMAC {{generated}} by the intellectual property (IP) core of Xilinx is used to process the data frames. It sends data frames to the GigE Tx and receives data frames from the GigE Rx. The MAC RxQ is similar with the MAC TxQ, which is just in a different transmission direction. When the MAC TxQ sends a data <b>frame,</b> a <b>counter</b> is opened; while the MAC RxQ finishes receiving that data <b>frame,</b> the above <b>counter</b> is closed by the MAC TxQ immediately. By their collaboration, the latency shown in Equation  2, which is accurate to the nanosecond, can be obtained.|$|R

This thesis {{is focused on the}} design and implementation of such network interface blocks operating at speed 10 Gb/s. Designed input interface block provides checking of several parts of the Ethernet frame and allows discarding of this frame based on checking results. Output interface block supports replacing frame's Source Address by a pre-set value and provides frame's CRC computation. Both network interface blocks also include a set of <b>frames</b> <b>counters.</b> Implemented network interface blocks were tested on the COMBO card. SystemVerilog verification testbench was also designed for both network interface blocks...|$|R

50|$|The {{controls}} {{of the camera}} differ considerably from those of a regular motion picture camera. The key to its operation is one or more <b>frame</b> <b>counters.</b> These enable the camera operator to roll the film backwards and forwards through the film gate, and to know exactly which frame is being exposed at a given time. Also key {{is the way the}} operation of the shutter is completely independent from the film transport, so a given frame may be exposed a number of different times, or not at all. Very long exposures are also possible, so that title streaks, zooms and other special effects can be created by keeping the shutter open while moving the camera head up and down the column; rotating or moving the lower platform from side to side; or doing both at the same time. For some of these types of effects, the artwork may be a transparency, which is back-lit by a light source below the table surface.|$|R
30|$|Thus, {{we propose}} a triple, mostly uncorrelated, source of {{location}} information. The GNSS (DGPS[*]+[*]map-matching) equipment, the balise reader and <b>frame</b> (preamble) <b>counter</b> {{take part in}} the HTRU strategy. This approach takes into consideration the downlink preambles that arrive one per frame. The RMPA approach also takes into account that during the scanning process there are no arrivals of downlink preambles from the serving BS.|$|R

In the proposed RGS scheme, stations are grouping into the active group, the ready group, and the idle group. Furthermore, stations announce the next <b>frame's</b> backoff <b>counter</b> beforehand.

5000|$|The M2 was {{considered}} to be a more affordable, simplified version of the 1954 Leica M3. Notably, the <b>frame</b> <b>counter</b> of the M2 was composed of a disk plate beneath the film advance lever that had to be manually reset to zero after reloading. This system was close to that of the Leica III series, and unlike that of the M3, which is an independent <b>frame</b> <b>counter,</b> visible through a window in the top plate, that automatically resets to zero when the film take-up spool is removed.|$|E
50|$|To load a film, two locks in {{the base}} of the camera need to be turned. The entire back and bottom can then be removed as a single unit, {{allowing}} easy access to the film chamber. Standard 35 mm film cassettes are used, with film being wound onto a removable take-up spool (the latter often becomes difficult to remove on older cameras). Winding the film cocks the shutter and forwards the <b>frame</b> <b>counter</b> simultaneously. The FED 2 has a manual <b>frame</b> <b>counter</b> located below the wind-on knob, which must be reset by hand when loading film.|$|E

40|$|In {{order to}} probe how social {{movement}} messages foster participant mobilization, this study utilized an experimental design to investigate collective action frames, core messaging tasks that define problems, assign blame, convey {{a plan of}} action, and inspire participation. The study compared the {{effects of climate change}} messages that contain motivational frames with those that do not, incorporating the influence of resonance, and exposure to competing and <b>counter</b> <b>frames.</b> Results revealed that motivational frames contributed to mobilization, especially intention to act, under conditions of resonance and with exposure to <b>counter</b> <b>frames.</b> Salience primed participants to respond to motivational frames, however for some, motivational frames decreased intention to act. As social movements and climate change continue to profoundly shape our world in myriad ways, we will be better prepared to address those changes with information provided here...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{contention-based}} protocol called backoff counter reservation and classifying stations (BCR-CS) for the IEEE 802. 11 distributed coordination function (DCF). In the proposed scheme, each station has three states: idle, reserved, and contentious. A station {{is in the}} idle state if it has no frame ready to transmit. A station is in the reserved state {{if it has a}} frame ready to transmit and this <b>frame’s</b> backoff <b>counter</b> has been successfully announced through the previous successfully transmitted frame so that other stations know this information. A station is in the contentious state if it has a frame ready to transmit, but this <b>frame’s</b> backoff <b>counter</b> has not been successfully announced to other stations. All the stations in the idle state, the reserved state, and the contentious state form an idle group, a reserved group, and a contentious group, respectively. Two backoff schemes are proposed in the BCR-CS protocol {{based on the number of}} stations in the contentious group including the optimal pseudo-ppersistent scheme. The proposed schemes are compared with the DCF and the Enhanced Collision Avoidance (ECA) scheme in the literature. Extensive simulations and some analytical analysis are carried out. Our results show that all proposed schemes outperform both the DCF and the ECA, and the BCR-CS with optimal pseudo-p-persistent scheme is the best scheme among the four schemes...|$|R

40|$|The {{condition}} {{sensor system}} comprises a condition detector which produces a pulse when a parameter of the monitored condition exceeds a desired threshold. A resettable condition counter counts each pulse. A resettable timer is preset {{to produce a}} particular time <b>frame.</b> The <b>counter</b> produces a condition signal when the accumulated number of pulses within the time frame is {{equal to or greater}} than a preset count. Control means responsive to the incoming pulses and to the condition signal produce control signals that control utilization devices. After a suitable delay, the last detected pulse simultaneously resets the pulse counter and the timer, and prepares them for sensing another condition occurrence within the time frame. The invention has particular utility in the process of detecting rocking motions of blind people. A controlled, audible, bio-feedback signal is provided which constitutes a warning to the blind person that he is rocking...|$|R
40|$|There {{is strong}} support among {{scholars}} that ideas {{are important in}} shaping public policy.  The aim of this thesis is to investigate the ideas present in the Swedish debate about privatization of education between 2003 and 2011 during different governments, and if Sweden has undergone an ideational shift where ideas of privatization are becoming more accepted not just among politicians but also among a wider base of actors. Framing theory {{and the concept of}} <b>counter</b> <b>framing</b> are used to categorize these ideas. A mixed methods approach is used where frames are first defined based on previous research about privatization of education, then identified in newspaper articles from three major Swedish newspapers, then quantified according to whether they are used by proponents or opponents of privatization and finally analyzed to investigate their content. We found that there had indeed been a change in which frames were used as well as how they were used between the years analyzed. This indicates that there has been an ideational shift towards market oriented ideas in Sweden which could be attributed to the change in government as <b>counter</b> <b>framing</b> was more common for proponents of privatization during a social democratic government and more common for opponents during a center-right government, however {{further research is needed to}} determine the validity of this correlation...|$|R
