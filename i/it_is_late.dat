500|$|In 1955 Wodehouse {{became an}} American citizen, though he {{remained}} a British subject, {{and was therefore}} eligible for UK state honours. He was considered for the award of a knighthood three times from 1967, but the honour was twice blocked by British officials. [...] In 1974 the British prime minister, Harold Wilson, intervened to secure a knighthood (KBE) for Wodehouse, which was announced in January 1975, in the same New Year Honours list in which Charlie Chaplin became Sir Charles. The Times commented that Wodehouse's honour signalled [...] "official forgiveness for his wartime indiscretion.... <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>late,</b> but not too late, to take {{the sting out of}} that unhappy incident." ...|$|E

2500|$|Armageddon and its singles have {{received}} a number of positive reviews. Jamie Horne, music journalist for the Border Mail gave the album {{four and a half}} out of five stars, saying, [...] "Armageddon truly is mature pop. But do not fear — it's not adult contemporary and, more importantly, it's nothing like the club pop that's been diseasing our charts. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>late,</b> however, having been penciled in for a mid-year release. But that's also forgiven early with the opening duo, Amnesia and Beg, the latter a swirling mid-tempo effort destined to be a live favourite." [...] Cameron Adams from the Herald Sun wrote, [...] "You've heard Guy's best single to date in Battle Scars; now welcome to his best album. His songwriting has matured as he's left the club behind to focus on the real world. Amnesia and Beg are classy, dramatic adult pop songs that showcase his voice." [...] Adams said [...] "Get Along" [...] was [...] "inspired", and showed new depth from Sebastian. Take 40, said, [...] "Brilliant work Guy! We know {{this is going to be}} a success, and will hopefully give you some ARIA nods this time next year." [...] They called the title track [...] "Armageddon" [...] an [...] "uplifting anthem", and said [...] "Get Along" [...] showed [...] "the beautiful timbre of his voice, and has a very inspiring message". Jessica Tisdell from music site Novastreamusic wrote, [...] "Sebastian's latest album Armageddon (2012) demonstrates the great growth as an artist that he has achieved over the years of dedication to his career. [...] Armageddon is one of those albums that you just listen to easily and does not have one bad track." [...] She said the lyrics of [...] "Get Along" [...] were [...] "heart-warming and send a great message to humanity" [...] and that [...] "Amnesia" [...] demonstrated [...] "Sebastian's amazing vocal range".|$|E
