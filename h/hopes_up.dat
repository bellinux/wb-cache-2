500|$|At {{the time}} of the {{broadcast}} of the final episode of the season, Scott D. Pierce for the Deseret News described Enterprise as not [...] "an awful show, it's just, well, boring." [...] He called the new story arc introduced in [...] "The Expanse" [...] a [...] "promising idea". But also added, [...] "it's pretty hard to get your <b>hopes</b> <b>up</b> too high for Enterprise." ...|$|E
500|$|Bart Simpson {{is one of}} Krusty's biggest fans. In {{the episode}} [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] (Season 1, Episode 12) he {{declared}} [...] "I've based my entire life on Krusty's teachings" [...] and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He exposed Sideshow Bob's attempted framing, helped Krusty return to {{the air with a}} comeback special and reignite his career and reunited Krusty with his estranged father. For his part, Krusty is usually grateful for Bart's assistance, but will almost immediately forget about it, presumably due to his excessive drinking and drug habits, and usually does not even remember his name the next time they encounter each other. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, largely because of the promise that he would get to spend his summer with Krusty. The camp {{turned out to be a}} disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen, as the camp was simply a franchise location that Krusty had licensed his image to. Bart kept his <b>hopes</b> <b>up</b> by believing that Krusty would show up, but one day the camp director, Mr. Black, brought in Barney Gumble with clown makeup masquerading as Krusty. This pushed Bart over the edge. He decided that he was sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and took over the camp. Krusty immediately visited the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and managed to appease Bart.|$|E
500|$|Bart {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} fans of children's {{television}} host Krusty the Clown. He once declared, [...] "I've based my whole life on Krusty's teachings," [...] and sleeps in a room filled with Krusty merchandise. He has helped the clown on many occasions, for example, foiling Sideshow Bob's attempt to frame Krusty for armed robbery in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted" [...] (season one, 1990), reuniting Krusty with his estranged father in [...] "Like Father, Like Clown". and helping Krusty return to the air with a comeback special and reignite his career in [...] "Krusty Gets Kancelled". For his part, Krusty has remained largely ignorant of Bart's help and treats Bart with disinterest. One summer, Bart enthusiastically attended Kamp Krusty, which turned out to be a disaster, with Krusty nowhere to be seen. Bart keeps his <b>hopes</b> <b>up</b> by believing that Krusty would show up, but is soon pushed over the edge, and finally decides that he is sick of Krusty's shoddy merchandise and takes over the camp. Krusty immediately visits the camp in hopes of ending the conflict and manages to appease Bart. One of the original ideas for the series was that Bart worshiped a television clown but had no respect for his father, although this was never directly explored. Because of this original plan, Krusty's design is basically Homer in clown make-up. When Bart foiled Sideshow Bob's plans in [...] "Krusty Gets Busted", it sparked a long-standing feud between the two. The writers decided to have Bob repeatedly return to get revenge on Bart. They took the idea of the Coyote chasing the Road Runner and depicted Bob as an intelligent person obsessed with catching a bratty boy. Bob has appeared in fourteen episodes, generally plotting various evil schemes which often have to do with getting revenge on Bart (and sometimes the entire Simpson family by proxy), but is always foiled in the end.|$|E

Other roles {{she has taken}} on include teaching the [...] "Drama Club", advising the [...] "Bayside Outdoor Club", and creating/leading the [...] "FLUB" [...] (Future Leaders United in Business) Club. Retailers say she takes too many freebies. She has appeared in several episodes throughout the series.

2500|$|Though {{bagpipes}} {{are closely}} associated with Scotland by many outsiders, the instrument (or, more precisely, family of instruments) is found throughout large swathes of Europe, North Africa and South Asia. [...] The most common bagpipe heard in modern Scottish music is the Great Highland Bagpipe, which was spread by the Highland regiments of the British Army. Historically, numerous other bagpipes existed, {{and many of them}} have been recreated in the last half-century. Also during the 19th century bagpipes were played on ships sailing off to war to keep the men's <b>hopes</b> <b>up</b> and to bring good luck in the coming war.|$|E
2500|$|Bregman was {{surprised}} {{about some of}} the negative reviews, but stated that some of the same reviewers have since [...] "retracted" [...] their views upon further discussions of the film. A few weeks before the film's premiere, De Palma told the crew not to get their <b>hopes</b> <b>up</b> about the film's reception. He correctly predicted that Pacino, having just won an Oscar, would be criticized; Koepp, having just done Jurassic Park, would [...] "suck"; Penn would be [...] "brilliant" [...] because he had not done anything for a while; and he himself, having not been forgiven for The Bonfire of the Vanities, would not quite be embraced.|$|E

2500|$|Big Black's first {{release for}} Touch and Go was the Headache EP in spring 1987. The cover artwork for the limited {{original}} {{edition of the}} EP {{was a pair of}} forensic photos of an accident victim whose head had been split down the middle, and the record was packaged in a black plastic [...] "body bag" [...] to conceal the artwork from sensitive consumers. A sticker on the EP's cover read [...] "Not as good as Atomizer, so don't get your <b>hopes</b> <b>up,</b> cheese!" [...] According to Durango, [...] "We didn't want to sit there and screw people. If we felt it wasn't as good, then we should just be honest about it." [...] Indeed, Headache recycled many of the same sounds and themes found on Atomizer, showing signs that the band was lagging creatively. Durango later remarked that [...] "I was feeling tapped out ideawise. At that point I think we had tried everything that we wanted to try, musically and in the studio." ...|$|E

And again, it was Mucluc Charley who presented convincing reasons for the sale and Percy Leclaire who held stubbornly back. A little later it was O’Brien himself who insisted on selling, while both friends, with tears and curses, strove to dissuade him. The more whiskey they downed, the more fertile of imagination they became. For one sober pro or con they found a score of drunken ones; and they convinced one another so readily that they were perpetually changing sides in the argument.|$|E
