5|$|An electoral {{division}} {{which is a}} GRC returns the number of MPs designated for the constituency by the President to serve in Parliament. A <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> standing together in a GRC is voted for as a team, and not as individual candidates. In other words, a successful voter's single vote in an SMC sends to Parliament one MP, and a GRC sends a group of MPs depending on how many have been designated for that GRC. All elected MPs are selected on a simple plurality voting ("first past the post") basis.|$|E
5|$|As Kishimoto {{originally}} planned Akatsuki to be a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> with close to no human characteristics, {{he decided to}} make Zetsu half black and half white to emphasize his split personality. In the Japanese anime, Zetsu is voiced by Nobuo Tobita, who also voices the Tobi and the White Zetsu Army. In episode 134 of the English adaptation, Black Zetsu is voiced by Michael Sorich and White Zetsu by Brian Beacock, though in the English Shippuden anime both halves are voiced by Travis Willingham.|$|E

The elevator to the Red Line was out of service for 15 months beginning in March 2011 for car replacement and the installation of a second, redundant, elevator. An accessible shuttle bus ran between Porter and Davis.|$|E

5|$|LDLR {{mutations}} {{are more}} common in certain populations, presumably because of a genetic phenomenon known as the founder effect—they were founded by a small <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals,</b> one or several of whom was a carrier of the mutation.

5|$|The {{first stage}} of the test {{considers}} whether the law prescribes different treatment for one <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> as against other groups. For example, in the 1998 High Court decision Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor, Judge of Appeal M.

5|$|Most significantly, however, he {{utilizes}} {{his fortune}} {{to build a}} vast network of criminals, spies, dupes and co-conspirators to help engineer what would be an almost impossibly complex and meticulously planned plot to destroy Spider-Man's life. To achieve this, he becomes {{the leader of the}} Scrier cabal, taking as his pawns Seward Trainer, Judas Traveller, the Jackal and Gaunt (Mendel Stromm, returned from the dead as a cyborg), all of whom he utilizes to carry out revenge against Peter Parker. It is this <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> who become crucial in duping Parker into believing that he is actually a clone of himself created by the Jackal, while claiming that the clone – who comes to be known as Ben Reilly – is actually the original.|$|E
25|$|One widely {{accepted}} theory about {{the transformation of}} autonomous communities to chiefdoms is that an individual, or <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> must have used some degree of coercion to begin controlling others in their community. Stronger factions may have used coercion to force weaker factions to submit to their desires, {{and in order to}} do this they may have obtained their strength through a number of different ways. First, canny choices of farming plots allowed an individual or <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> to systematically gain an upper hand in crop production. Second, good alliance-building tactics may have been performed to stave off attacks by competing factions. And, lastly, healthy offspring would have ensured that an individual's lineage was secure for long after they were gone, allowing strong hereditary associations to control the fate of the dynasty.|$|E

40|$|Understanding {{how large}} <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> move within their environment, {{and the social}} {{interactions}} that occur during this movement, is central to many fundamental interdisciplinary research questions; ranging from understanding the evolution of cooperation, to managing human crowd behaviour. If we could understand how <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> interact with their environment, and any role that the environment plays in their behaviour, we could design and develop space to better suit their needs. Spatiotemporal datasets that record the movement <b>of</b> large <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals</b> are becoming increasingly available. A method, based {{on a set of}} coherence criteria, has previously been developed to identify different types of collective within such datasets. However, further investigations have revealed that the method can be used to reveal important information about the environment. This paper applies the method to a spatiotemporal dataset that records the movements of ships within the Solent, in the UK, over a twenty-four hour period to explore what can be inferred from the movement <b>of</b> <b>groups</b> <b>of</b> <b>individuals,</b> referred to as spatial collectives, regarding the environment...|$|R
