Initially he told his team not to discuss cyber-terrorism publicly, to avoid giving governments {{ideas on how to}} sabotage their political opponents. After the American film Live Free or Die Hard (AKA Die Hard 4.0) (2007) was released, Kaspersky said the idea was now public. He hired the researcher that identified the Stuxnet worm, which {{is believed to be the}} first instance of state-sponsored cyberweapon. Afterwards, the company exposed the Flame virus at the request of the International Telecommunication Union. The virus was believed to have been used for cyber-espionage in Middle-Eastern countries.|$|E
5|$|The {{college is}} {{actively}} involved in the development and use of assistive technology to aid visually impaired people in their everyday lives. For example, working with a United States-based software engineer, RNC produced the T3 (Talking Tactile Tablet), a touch sensitive device for interpreting tactile images such as diagrams, charts and maps. The device is connected to a computer and run with a programme CD, and has a tactile surface which produces touchable icons that provide audio feedback when they are pressed. The device was originally developed for educational purposes but can be adapted for other uses. In 2005 Hereford Museum and Art Gallery became the first in the United Kingdom to invest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology.</b> The T3 was later marketed internationally {{with the help of the}} UK Trade & Investment's passport initiative– a scheme which gives new exporters the training, planning and support they need to succeed in overseas markets.|$|E

5|$|General Dynamics and BAE Systems, who {{received}} contracts in the Ground Combat Vehicle program, criticized the CBO report, saying {{they used the}} wrong vehicle in its analysis. Officials from both companies said they used the wrong notional model of the GCV that did {{not account for the}} change in requirements made by the Army or the advancements made <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> development phase of the program. They also criticized the comparisons of the other vehicles. The report factored cost, survivability, mobility, and lethality, ranking the GCV's capabilities as lower than all others. The Army questioned the suitability of existing design. An Army test of currently fielded vehicles in 2012 revealed that some met critical GCV requirements, but none met enough without needing significant redesign. They also note that lethality was judged with a 25mm cannon for analysis, before the Army planned to mount a 30mm cannon. The CBO report did give credit to cost, assuming the Army's goal of $13 million per vehicle. However, Pentagon cost assessments estimated the price at $16–$17 million per vehicle.|$|E

40|$|We {{develop a}} model in which sectoral trade {{patterns}} depend on both <b>the</b> <b>technology</b> common to all sectors and <b>the</b> <b>technologies</b> specific to each sector. Changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> common <b>technology</b> level affect sectoral trade patterns through their impact on intertemporal optimization behavior, while changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sector-specific <b>technology</b> levels affect sectoral trade patterns by influencing comparative advantage. The model shows: (1) unexpected increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> common <b>technology</b> level worsen sectoral trade balances, but expected increases <b>in</b> <b>the</b> common <b>technology</b> level improve them; and (2) given other countries' sectoral technology levels, an increase in a sector-specific technology level relative to other sectors improves sectoral trade balances through its operation on comparative advantage. Using Japanese data, the empirical results reported in this paper support the model's predictions. Copyright � 2007 The Authors. ...|$|R
