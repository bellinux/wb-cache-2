The Court granted the Mayor and City of Baltimore only nominal damages as just compensation for <b>the</b> <b>alleys.</b> <b>The</b> Court reasoned that the condemnation of the land to which <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> abutted, removed any use of <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> and thus, {{there was no need}} to replace <b>the</b> <b>alleys.</b> <b>The</b> Court also found that since the City held <b>the</b> land <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> <b>in</b> trust for <b>the</b> benefit of the public, its interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>alleys</b> were beneficial use interest. To receive just compensation however for condemnation, the City had to have a fee interest. The Mayor and City of Baltimore appealed to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals. The Fourth Circuit upheld the District Court’s awarding the Mayor and City of Baltimore nominal damages...|$|R
