40|$|The article {{presents}} a schematic {{diagram of the}} Euro- 3 diesel engine electronic control and describes hard- and software platform of the high pressure fuel pump pneumatic actuator control that allows to realize the concept of electronic fuel supply control of diesel engine KamAZ- 740. The strategic dependence beetwen the angular position of fuel pump <b>governor</b> <b>lever</b> and the angular position of electronic accelerator pedal were put {{on the basis of}} electronic control concept. Implementation of this dependence was carried out by applying a modulated PWM signal with determined duty cycle by the controller to the coil proportional solenoid valve, which is responsible for the amount of air pressure in the working chamber of the power air cylinder, connected by articulated-type to the <b>governor</b> <b>lever</b> of the high pressure fuel pump. In this case, the feedback control by position of <b>governor</b> <b>lever</b> of the high pressure fuel pump was introduced in the control circuit, but engine crankshaft speed control was carried out using a software continuous PID governor. Developed strategy gives possibility to track the deflection  of control parameter from a predetermined value by real-time and almost instantly, to make a control action on actuators to eliminate this deflection, while providing a minimum time of transition. Governor’s setting (proportional, integral and differential component) performed empirically using the classical Ziegler – Nichols method, based on the analysis of the safety factor of automatic control system. The results of calculating the coefficients of proportional integral-differential regulator and oscillograms HIL experiment on testing the proposed diesel engine throttle control strategies using visualization CoDeSys V 2. 3 are given in activity. </p...|$|E
25|$|The {{automatic}} brake works by monitoring the speed using a centrifugal governor connected by gears {{to a large}} toothed gear mounted on the pinion axle next to the wheel (i.e. {{it is not the}} pinion gear). When the set speed is exceeded a <b>lever</b> on the <b>governor</b> hits a <b>lever</b> on a brake valve, and the brakes operate. The {{automatic brake}} can only be released after the train has come to a stop, and the driver has to leave the locomotive to reset the system. On the steam locomotives, steam is applied to a small brake cylinder that acts on the driver's side brakes. On the carriages, the automatic brake is an air brake. On the diesel locomotives, a hydraulic cylinder is used.|$|R
50|$|With {{the slogan}} “The challenger“, the HATZ 1B-series was {{presented}} in 1996, showing a number of technical highlights. In a minimum of space, all the important functional components of the engine such as decompression device, injection pump drive, oil pump with oil pump pressure regulator, valve train system for inlet and outlet valve, <b>governor,</b> speed control <b>lever</b> with <b>governor</b> spring and the multi-functional mechanical control system are integrated in the governor housing. Due to these technical features, the B-series scores with a light-weight and compact design.Depending on their cylinder capacity, the air-cooled one-cylinder diesel engines of B-series are available at power ranges from 1.5 to 7.6 kW and a maximum speed of 3600 rpm. Furthermore, models with vertical or horizontal crankshaft are available. The B-series complies with the strict requirements of EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) Tier IV final in the US.|$|R
40|$|EXPLANATION OF THE TEST PROCEDURE General Tractors {{are tested}} at the University of Nebraska {{according}} to the Agricultural Tractor Test Code approved by the American Society of Agricultural Engineers and the Society of Automotive Engineers or official Nebraska test procedure. The manufacturer selects the tractor to be tested and certifies {{that it is a}} stock model. Each tractor is equipped with the common power consuming accessories such as power steering, power lift pump, generator, etc., if available. Power consuming accessories may be disconnected only when the means for disconnecting can be reached from the operating station. An official representative of the company is present during the test to see that the tractor gives its optimum performance. Additional weight may be added to the tractor as ballast if the manufacturer recommends use of such ballast. The static tire loads and the tire inflation pressures must conform to the Tire Standards published by the ASAE and SAE. Preparation for Test The engine crankcase is drained and refilled with new oil conforming to specifications in the operator 2 ̆ 7 s manual. The operator 2 ̆ 7 s manual is also used as the guide for selecting the proper fuel and for routine lubrication and maintenance operations 2 ̆ 2. The tractor is limbered up for 12 hours on the drawbar, using each gear with light to heavy loads during the limber-up period. Preliminary adjustment of the tractor is permitted at this time. Any parts added or replaced during the limber-up run, or any subsequent runs, are mentioned in the individual test reports. The tractor is equipped with approximately the amount of added ballast that is to be used during the drawbar runs. PTO Performance Power take-off performance runs are made by connecting the power take-off (or the belt pulley if no power take-off is available) to a dynamometer. During a preliminary power take-off run the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s representative may make adjustment for the fuel, ignition or injection timing and governor control settings. These settings must be maintained {{for the remainder of the}} test. The manually operated governor control mechanism is set to provide the high-idle speed specified by the manufacturer. During the power take-off runs an ambient air temperature of approximately 75 0 F. is maintained. Maximum power is obtained at the rated engine speed specified by the manufacturer with the <b>governor</b> control <b>lever</b> set for maximum power. This same setting is used for all subsequent PTO runs. Time of the run is two hours. Whenever the power take-off speed during the maximum power run differs from the speeds set forth in the ASAE and SAE standards, an additional run is made at either 540 or 1000 rpm of the power take-off shaft. Time of this run is one hour. Drawbar Performance Maximum drawbar power is shown for the normal field speed selected by the manufacturer. All engine adjustments are the same as those used in the power take-off runs. If the manufacturer specifies a different rated engine speed for drawbar operations, then the position of the manually operated governor control is changed to provide the high-idle speed specified. Maximum drawbar power is determined within the following limits: (1) slip of the drivers must not exceed 15...|$|R
40|$|EXPLANATION OF TEST REPORT GENERAL CONDITIONS East tractor is a {{production}} model equipped for common usage. Power consuming accessories can be disconnected {{only when it}} is convenient for the operator {{to do so in}} practice. Additional weight can be added as ballast if the manufacturer regularly supplies it for sale. The static tire loads and the inflation pressures muse conform to recommendations in the Tire Standards published by the Society of Automotive Engineers. PREPARATION FOR PERFORMANCE RUNS The engine crank case is drained and refilled with a measured amount of new oil conforming to specifications in the operator’s manual. The fuel used and the maintenance operations must also conform to the published information delivered with the tractor. The tractor is then limbered-up for 1 hour on drawbar work in accordance with the manufacturers published recommendations. The manufacturer’s representative is present to make appropriate decisions regarding mechanical adjustments. The tractor is equipped with approximately the amount of added ballast that is used during maximum drawbar tests. The tire tread-bar height must be at least 65 % of new tread height prior to the maximum power run. BELT OR POWER TAKE-OFF PERFORMANCE Maximum Power and Fuel Consumption. The manufacturer’s representative makes carburetor, fuel pump, ignition and governor control settings which remain unchanged throughout tall subsequent runs. The governor and the manually operated <b>governor</b> control <b>lever</b> is set to provide the high-idle speed specified by the manufacturer for maximum power. Maximum power is measured by connecting the belt pulley or the power take-off to a dynamometer. The dynamometer load is then gradually increased until the engine is operating at the rated speed specified by the manufacturer for maximum power. The corresponding fuel consumption is measured. Varying Power and Fuel Consumption. Six different horsepower levels are used to show corresponding fuel consumption rates and how the governor causes the engine to react to the following changes in dynamometer load: 85 % of the dynamometer torque at maximum power; minimum dynamometer torque, ½ the 85 % torque; maximum power; ¼ and ¾ of the 85 % torque. Since at tractor is generally subjected to varying loads the average of the results in this test serve well for predicting the fuel consumption of a tractor in general usage. DRAWBAR PERFORMANCE All engine adjustments are the same as those used in the belt or power take-off tests. If the manufacturer specifies a different rated crankshaft speed for drawbar operations, then the position of the manually operated governor control is changed to provide the high-idle speed specified by the manufacturer in the operating instructions. Varying Power and Fuel Consumption With Ballast. The varying power runs are made to show the effect of speed-control devices (engine governor, automatic transmissions, etc.) on horsepower, speed and fuel consumption. These runs are made around the entire test course with has two 180 degree turns with a minimum radius of 50 feet. The drawbar pull is set at 3 different levels as follows: (1) as near to the pull a maximum power as possible and still have the tractor maintain the travel speed at maximum horsepower on the straight sections of the test course; (2) 75 % of the pull at maximum power; and (3) 50 % of the pull at maximum power. Prior to 1958, fuel consumption data (10 hour test) were shown only for the pull obtained at maximum power for tractors having torque converters and at 75 % of the pull obtained at maximum power for gear-type tractors. Maximum Power With Ballast. Maximum power is measured on straight level sections of the test course. Data are shown for not more that 12 different gears or travel speeds. Some gears or travel speeds may be omitted because of high slippage of the traction members or because the travel speed may exceed the safe-limit for the test course. The maximum safe speed for the Nebraska Test course has been set at 15 miles per hour. The slippage limits have been set at 15 % and 7 % for pneumatic tires and steel tracks or lugs, respectively. Higher slippage gives widely varying results. Maximum Power Without Ballast. All added ballast is removed from the tractor. The maximum drawbar power of the tractor is determined by the same procedure used for getting maximum power with ballast. The gear (or travel speed) is the same as that used in the 10 -hours test. Varying Power and Travel Speed With Ballast. Travel speeds corresponding to drawbar pulls beyond the maximum power range are obtained to show the “lugging ability” of the tractor. The run starts with the pull at maximum power; then additional drawbar pull is applied to cause decreasing speeds. The run is ended by one of three conditions; (1) maximum pull is obtained, (2) the maximum slippage limit is reached, or (3) some other operating limit is reached...|$|R
