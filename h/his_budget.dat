5|$|In March, Finance Minister Walter Harris, who was {{believed}} to be St. Laurent's heir apparent, introduced <b>his</b> <b>budget.</b> The budget anticipated a surplus of $258million, of which $100million was to be returned in the form of increased welfare payments, with an increase of $6 per month (to a total of $46) for old age pensioners—effective after the election. Harris indicated that no more could be returned for fear of increasing inflation. Diefenbaker attacked the budget, calling for higher old age pensions and welfare payments, more aid to the poorer provinces, and aid to farmers.|$|E
5|$|Democrats won a {{majority}} in the Indiana House of Representatives in the 2006 and 2008 elections. This caused Indiana to have a divided government, with Democrats controlling the Indiana House of Representatives and the Republicans controlling the governor's office and the Indiana Senate. This also lead to a stalemate in the budget debate, which caused Mitch Daniels call a special session of the Indiana General Assembly. The state was faced with a $1 billion shortfall in revenue for the 2009–11 budget years. Daniels proposed a range of spending cuts and cost-saving measures in <b>his</b> <b>budget</b> proposal. The General Assembly approved some of his proposals, but relied heavily on the state's reserve funds to pay for the budget shortfall. Daniels signed the $27 billion two-year budget into law.|$|E
50|$|Whether {{the next}} two Finance Ministers, John Turner and Donald Macdonald, {{delivered}} their budgets with new shoes is unknown. Macdonald's successor Jean Chrétien wore new shoes for both of <b>his</b> <b>budgets</b> of 1978. The next minister, John Crosbie, wore used mukluks in 1979 for <b>his</b> only <b>budget.</b> Following Crosbie, whether Allan MacEachen wore new shoes is unknown, but in 1984 his successor, Marc Lalonde, did for <b>his</b> second <b>budget.</b> Michael Wilson wore new shoes {{for the first four}} of the six budgets he presented beginning in 1985.|$|R

25|$|Egerton was {{a strong}} {{advocate}} of colonial development. He believed in deficit financing at certain periods of a colony's growth, which was reflected in <b>his</b> <b>budgets</b> from 1906 to 1912. He had a constant struggle to obtain approval for these budgets from the colonial office.|$|R
5|$|Soon after Chandler took office, {{it became}} clear that he could not fund the social {{programs}} initiated by Clements and Wetherby, plus Chandler's own proposed programs, with the revenue presently being brought into the state treasury. He cut the popular Youth Authority, initiated by Wetherby to unify the state's children's welfare programs, but the savings were not enough to balance the budget. In order to deliver on his campaign promises, Chandler ignored the budget during the regular legislative session in 1956, then called a special session during which he presented <b>his</b> <b>budget</b> proposal. The proposal called for spending in excess of $46million more than officials estimated would be brought into the state's coffers over the two-year budget. Chandler convinced legislators to pass the budget, promising to propose a tax plan to pay for the expenditures in a subsequent special session. The promised package added 150,000 citizens to the state's tax rolls, put a surtax on income taxes, and cut tax credits. It created a new 5 percent production tax on whisky, and added taxes to deeds and life insurance premiums. It increased the state gasoline tax for trucks by two cents per gallon and raised corporate taxes by half a percent. In addition, it transferred the assessment and collection of taxes on certain intangibles from local to state government. The plan also called for a $100million bond issue, allowing the allocation of generous budgets for state universities and colleges and improvements to the state highway system.|$|E
5|$|With <b>his</b> <b>budget</b> {{concerns}} alleviated, Chandler booked time at Olympic, {{where on}} February 3, 1967, {{he and the}} Experience met sound engineer Eddie Kramer. During Kramer's first session with the group, he deviated from the standard recording method {{that they had been}} using at CBS and De Lane Lea, which was to record bass and drums in mono on two tracks. He instead recorded Mitchell's drums on two tracks in stereo, leaving the remaining two tracks available for Redding's bass and rhythm guitar parts played by Hendrix. Kramer's unorthodox approach, which was inspired by Hendrix's complaints regarding the limitations of four-track recordings, captured the live sound of the band using all four available tracks. Kramer and Chandler then pre-mixed and reduced the first four tracks down to two, making two more tracks available for lead guitar overdubs and vocals. This method satisfied both Hendrix's perfectionism and Chandler's desire {{to reduce the number of}} takes required for a satisfactory rhythm track, thus minimizing their expenses. Another change instigated by Kramer was the use of a mixture of close and distant microphone placements when recording Hendrix's guitar parts whereas, during previous sessions, the microphones had been placed about twelve feet away from Hendrix's amplifiers. In addition to the usual choices, Kramer used Beyer M1 60 ribbon microphones, which were typically not used to record loud music.|$|E
