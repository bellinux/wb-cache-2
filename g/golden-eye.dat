Other migrating birds include Canada geese, wood ducks, mallards, blue-winged teal, and hooded mergansers.

60|$|Some of {{his hunting}} ways are most curious. One winter day, in prowling along the beach, I {{approached}} {{the spot where}} {{a day or two}} before I had been shooting whistlers (<b>golden-eye</b> ducks) over decoys. The blind had been made by digging a hole in the sand. In the bottom was an armful of dry seaweed, to keep one's toes warm, and just behind the stand was the stump of a ship's mainmast, the relic of some old storm and shipwreck, cast up by the tide.|$|E
40|$|This is a {{selection}} from Jonathan Tel’s forthcoming {{collection of short}} stories, The Beijing of Possibilities, to be published this summer by Other Press. Tel {{is the author of}} Freud’s Alphabet and the story collection Arafat’s Elephant. His stories have appeared in The New Yorker and Granta. Drawn to “writing fiction set in places whose inhabitants believe themselves to {{be at the center of}} the world,” Tel first visted China in 1988 and has particular affinity for Beijing. It’s been a while since the Monkey King set out on his Journey to the West. With his Fiery-Gazing <b>Golden-Eyes</b> he infallibly recognized Evil, and vowed to combat it in every form. He changed shape at will and leaped from cloud to cloud. It was in the spring of 2008 that the Gorillagram appeared in mainland China. (One of those fads, we believe, that sneaked in from America or Europe.) A Taiwanese-owned company introduced the concept; they were in the business of couriering documents around Beijing, and they diversified, or call it a promotional gimmick. The way it works is that a man in a gorilla suit arrives in your building. He steps out of the elevator and jogs right up to the reception desk, banging his chest. He’s directed to the appropriate cubicle, where he sings, ‘Happy Birthday to You!’ to the lucky and amazed recipient, or ‘Congratulations on your Promotion! Ten thousand Congratulations!’ He accepts his tip, and off he goes. So who is he, this fellow in the furry disguise? His true name is unknown; no doubt he’s a migrant worker, not legally resident in the capital. The salary is pitiful, and the costume hot and itchy; he must be from the South. He’s not as tall as he looks: his real eyes are at the level of the Gorilla’s snout, and he speaks through a veil around its throat. Six days a week, he cycles around Beijing, going wherever he’s told; sometimes he’s in a hell of a rush, pedaling like crazy, scarcely time to pant his song before he dashes to the next appointment; but there’s downtime too – he un-Velcros his head and puffs a cigarette. There are worse ways to make a living...|$|R

50|$|Teloschistes chrysophthalmus, often {{referred}} to as the gold-eye lichen or <b>golden-eye,</b> is a fruticose lichen with branching lobes. Their sexual structures, apothecia, are bright-orange with spiny projections (cilia) situated around the rim. It has a global distribution, but is often localized and rare in many parts of its range. Colonies most often form along coastal areas.|$|E

40|$|Determining the {{location}} of a wireless client is a key problem for location-aware systems and for security applications. Many recent studies have used Bayesian methods to determine location from wireless LAN signals, but such methods have the drawback that a model must first be built from training data. The introduction of model error can drastically reduce the robustness of {{the location}} estimates, rendering most models incapable of tolerating hardware differences, channel variations, and intentional interferences from malicious users. This thesis describes the design, implementation and analysis of <b>Golden-Eye,</b> a robust wireless LAN location-sensing system that uses new techniques to address this problem. By fitting training data into Gaussian distributions and using relative signal strength, <b>Golden-Eye</b> works independent of the client's 802. 11 implementation or transmission power level, making it suitable even for tracking clients that might be trying to hide their locations...|$|E
