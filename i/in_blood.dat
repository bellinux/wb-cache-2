5|$|The {{effects of}} {{methoxyflurane}} on the circulatory system {{resemble those of}} diethyl ether. In dogs, methoxyflurane anesthesia causes a moderate decrease <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> pressure with minimal changes in heart rate, and no significant effect on blood sugar, epinephrine, or norepinephrine. Bleeding and increased arterial partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PaCO2) both induce further decreases <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, as well as increases <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> glucose, epinephrine and norepinephrine. In humans, methoxyflurane produces some decrease <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, but cardiac output, stroke volume, and total peripheral resistance are only minimally depressed. Its effect on the pulmonary circulation is negligible, {{and it does not}} predispose the heart to cardiac dysrhythmias.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>blood</b> plasma, zinc {{is bound}} to and transported by albumin (60%, low-affinity) and {{transferrin}} (10%). Because transferrin also transports iron, excessive iron reduces zinc absorption, and vice versa. A similar antagonism exists with copper.

Cells in the salivary gland, prostate, immune system, and intestine use zinc signaling to communicate with other cells.|$|E

5|$|Raziel {{returns as}} {{the protagonist of}} Soul Reaver 2. In Soul Reaver, Raziel {{discovered}} that he was once a human and a leading member of the vampire-hunting Sarafan brotherhood, and his epiphanies drive {{the conflict in the}} story. Kain, the antagonist of Soul Reaver, appears as a non-player character in cutscenes, urging Raziel to unearth his destiny. Moebius the Time Streamer, a sorcerer who was a villain <b>in</b> <b>Blood</b> Omen, attempts to manipulate Raziel into destroying Kain—it is revealed that he is an agent of The Elder God, Raziel's ally and guide in Soul Reaver, who is slowly established as a more sinister entity. Ariel, a specter bound to the Pillars who featured <b>in</b> <b>Blood</b> Omen and Soul Reaver, returns, and the vampire Vorador, also from Blood Omen, assists Raziel early in the game.

5|$|Adrenaline and {{noradrenaline}} are catecholamines, water-soluble {{compounds that}} have a structure made of a catechol group and an amine group. The adrenal glands are {{responsible for most of}} the adrenaline that circulates in the body, but only for a small amount of circulating noradrenaline. These hormones are released by the adrenal medulla, which contains a dense network of blood vessels. Adrenaline and noradrenaline act at adrenoreceptors throughout the body, with effects that include an increase <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> pressure and heart rate. The actions of adrenaline and noradrenaline are responsible for the fight or flight response, characterised by a quickening of breathing and heart rate, an increase <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, and constriction of blood vessels {{in many parts of the}} body.|$|E
5|$|After secretion, only a {{very small}} {{proportion}} of the thyroid hormones travel freely in the blood. Most are bound to thyroxine-binding globulin (about 70%), transthyretin (10%), and albumin (15%). Only the 0.03% of T4 and 0.3% of T3 traveling freely has hormonal activity. In addition, up to 85% of the T3 <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> is produced following conversion from T4 by iodothyronine deiodinases in organs around the body.|$|E
5|$|Alprazolam may be {{quantified}} <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> or plasma to confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalized patients, provide evidence in an impaired driving arrest, or to assist in a medicolegal death investigation.

5|$|Because {{consuming}} {{too much}} sodium increases risk of cardiovascular diseases, health organizations generally recommend that people reduce their dietary intake of salt.

A reduction in sodium intake by 1,000mg per day may reduce cardiovascular disease by about 30 percent. In adults and children with no acute illness, a decrease in the intake of sodium from the typical high levels reduces blood pressure. A low sodium diet results in a greater improvement <b>in</b> <b>blood</b> pressure in people with hypertension.|$|E
