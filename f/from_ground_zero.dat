5|$|On the 10th {{anniversary of}} the September 11 attacks on the United States, Smooth aired a {{documentary}} featuring British people who were living in New York City {{at the time of}} the attacks. This was followed by live coverage of the remembrance service <b>from</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero,</b> the former site of the World Trade Center, which was destroyed in the attacks.|$|E
5|$|Because Stuyvesant was {{so close}} to the World Trade Center site, there were {{concerns}} of asbestos exposure. The US EPA indicated at that time that Stuyvesant was safe from asbestos, and conducted a thorough cleaning of the Stuyvesant building, but the Stuyvesant High School Parents' Association has contested the accuracy of the assessment. Some problems, including former teacher Mark Bodenheimer's respiratory problems, have been reported—he accepted a transfer to The Bronx High School of Science after having difficulty continuing his work at Stuyvesant. Other isolated cases include Stuyvesant's 2002 Class President Amit Friedlander, who received local press coverage in September 2006 after he was diagnosed with cancer. While there have been other cases linked to the same dust cloud that emanated <b>from</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero,</b> a spot precariously close to Stuyvesant, there is no definitive evidence that such cases have directly affected the Stuyvesant community. Stuyvesant students did spend a full year in the building before the theater and air systems were cleaned, however, and a group of Stuyvesant alumni is currently lobbying for health insurance as a result.|$|E
25|$|To {{highlight}} {{the effect that}} being indoors, and especially below ground can make, despite the lethal open air radiation, blast and thermal zone extending well past her position at Hiroshima, Akiko Takakura survived {{the effects of the}} 16 kt atomic bomb at a distance of 300 meters <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> <b>zero,</b> sustaining only minor injuries, due in greatest part to her position {{in the lobby of the}} Bank of Japan, a reinforced concrete building, at the time of the nuclear explosion, and to {{highlight the}} protection conferred to an individual who is below ground during a nuclear air burst, Eizo Nomura survived the same blast at Hiroshima at a distance of 170 meters <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> <b>zero.</b> Nomura, who was in the basement of what is now known as the rest house, also a reinforced concrete building, lived into his early 80s.|$|E

In 2002 she sent several reports from Galicia in northern Spain following the ecological disaster when the oil tanker Prestige sank.|$|E
25|$|Muslim {{neoconservative}} journalist Stephen Schwartz, Executive Director of {{the non-profit}} Center for Islamic Pluralism, said that building the center two blocks <b>from</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero</b> {{is inconsistent with}} the Sufi philosophy of simplicity of faith and sensitivity towards others and disregards the security of American Muslims. He also criticized what he termed Abdul Rauf's radical and suspect associations.|$|E
25|$|High-speed {{cameras were}} placed in {{protected}} locations to capture effects of radiation and shock waves. Typical imagery from these cameras shows paint boiling off the buildings, which then are pushed away <b>from</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero</b> by the shock wave before being drawn toward the detonation by the suction caused by the climbing mushroom cloud. Footage from these cameras has become iconic, used in various media and available {{in the public domain}} and on DVD.|$|E

If all the questions are answered correctly on the Normal difficulty setting, the mission can be replayed with Big Boss's standard character model replaced with Snake's Metal Gear Solid low-polygon model. The Phantom Pain shows that Snake's Metal Gear Solid low-polygon model can be an alternate outfit for Venom Snake after transferring the save data <b>from</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>Zeroes.</b> David is also alluded in association with Eli during conversation between Big Boss and Ocelot.|$|R
25|$|Based on one persons account, Rexnord accused J.M. Brennan {{employees}} of discouraging the evacuation. J.M. Brennan has adamantly denied this. Although {{they did not}} design it or install the entire system, J.M. Brennan acknowledged they installed parts of the system, including the pipeline, across 1962-1963. The case settled out of court. Falk also had a fatal explosion in 1964 which killed one person and damaged a car almost a mile <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> <b>zero.</b> Attorney Robert Habush, representing the families, says the line was installed by Brennan, in 1988.|$|E
25|$|King of Prussia {{is home to}} the King of Prussia Volunteer Fire Company 9/11 Memorial {{honoring the}} lives lost in the September 11 attacks.

The 9/11 Memorial is located adjacent to the King of Prussia Volunteer Fire Company station on Allendale Road across from the King of Prussia Mall.|$|E
25|$|The {{collapse}} of the towers spread dust across New York City and left {{hundreds of thousands of}} tons of debris at the site. To organize the cleanup and search for survivors and for human remains, the New York City Fire Department divided the disaster site into four sectors, each headed by its own chief. Cleanup workers trucked most of the building materials and debris <b>from</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero</b> to Fresh Kills Landfill in Staten Island. Some people, such as those affiliated with World Trade Center Families for Proper Burial, were worried that human remains might also have been inadvertently transported to the landfill.|$|E

25|$|The statue was rededicated on October 19, 2012 by General John Mulholland. At {{the time}} of the {{original}} battle he was Lieutenant general and Deputy Commanding General of U.S. Army Special Forces Command. He dedicated the statue in its new location in front of One World Trade Center across <b>from</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero</b> and 9/11 Memorial. The bronze statue was positioned so the soldier atop the horse is keeping a watchful eye as he looks back {{over his shoulder at the}} World Trade Center and its tenants. Soldiers representing the United States Army Special Operations Command attended the ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Since the victims' fund {{made all}} its {{payments}} and closed in 2003, Lieberman will not receive any money. The decision {{does mean that}} Philip's name {{can be added to}} official memorials to the victims. One to her specifically has already been established at Dutchess Community College, where her mother works as a computer programmer. The family buried an urn full of ashes <b>from</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero</b> at a cemetery near their home. Six months after the appeals court decision, in July 2008, the family was officially notified by the city that Philip had been added to the victims' list.|$|E
500|$|Operation Crossroads {{began with}} the first blast (Test Able), an air burst on 1 July 1946; she was [...] <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> <b>zero</b> and was only lightly damaged. A {{skeleton}} crew boarded Nagato to assess the damage and prepare her for the next test on 25 July. As a test, they operated one of her boilers for 36 hours without any problems. For Test Baker, an underwater explosion, the ship was positioned [...] <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> <b>zero.</b> Nagato rode out the tsunami {{of water from the}} explosion with little apparent damage; she had a slight starboard list of two degrees after the tsunami dissipated. A more thorough assessment could not be made because she was dangerously radioactive. Her list gradually increased over the next five days and she capsized and sank during the night of 29/30 July.|$|E

500|$|A {{pre-test}} explosion {{was conducted}} on 7 May 1945 to calibrate the instruments. A wooden test platform was erected [...] <b>from</b> <b>Ground</b> <b>Zero</b> and piled with [...] of TNT spiked with nuclear fission products {{in the form of}} an irradiated uranium slug from Hanford, which was dissolved and poured into tubing inside the explosive. This explosion was observed by Oppenheimer and Groves's new deputy commander, Brigadier General Thomas Farrell. The pre-test produced data that proved vital for the Trinity test.|$|E
500|$|On March 24, 2009, the Japanese {{government}} officially recognized Tsutomu Yamaguchi as {{a double}} hibakusha. He was confirmed to be [...] <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> <b>zero</b> in Hiroshima {{on a business}} trip when Little Boy was detonated. He was seriously burnt on his left side and spent the night in Hiroshima. He arrived at his home city of Nagasaki on August 8, the day before Fat Man was dropped, and he was exposed to residual radiation while searching for his relatives. He was the first officially recognized survivor of both bombings. He died on January 4, 2010, at the age of 93, after a battle with stomach cancer.|$|E
2500|$|One {{dramatic}} {{source of}} man-made radioactivity is {{a nuclear weapons}} test. The glassy trinitite formed by the first atom bomb contains radioisotopes formed by neutron activation and nuclear fission. [...] In addition some natural radioisotopes are present. [...] A recent paper reports the levels of long-lived radioisotopes in the trinitite. The trinitite was formed from feldspar and quartz which were melted by the heat. Two samples of trinitite were used, the first (left-hand-side bars in the graph) was taken from between 40 and 65 meters of <b>ground</b> <b>zero</b> while the other sample was taken from further away <b>from</b> the <b>ground</b> <b>zero</b> point.|$|R

500|$|Some of the {{reinforced}} concrete buildings in Hiroshima {{had been very}} strongly constructed because of the earthquake danger in Japan, and their framework did not collapse {{even though they were}} fairly close to the blast center. Since the bomb detonated in the air, the blast was directed more downward than sideways, which was largely responsible for the survival of the Prefectural Industrial Promotional Hall, now commonly known as the Genbaku (A-bomb) dome. This building was designed and built by the Czech architect Jan Letzel, and was only [...] <b>from</b> <b>ground</b> <b>zero.</b> The ruin was named Hiroshima Peace Memorial and was made a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996 over the objections of the United States and China, which expressed reservations on the grounds that other Asian nations were the ones who suffered the greatest loss of life and property, and a focus on Japan lacked historical perspective.|$|E
