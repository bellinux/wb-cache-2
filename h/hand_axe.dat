A common {{technique}} used {{to capture the}} animals was to attach a loop of ropey bark {{to the end of}} a long, thin pole, so as to form a noose. This would be used to snare an animal high in a tree, beyond the reach of a climbing hunter; an animal brought down this way would then be killed with a stone <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> or hunting stick (waddy). According to the customs of some tribes, it was considered taboo to skin the animal, while other tribes thought the animal's head had a special status, and saved them for burial.|$|E

25|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>axes</b> {{constitute}} an important group artefacts from the Acheulean. They {{are particularly important}} in open air archaeological sites (Keelley suggested that they are less common in cave sites.) <b>Hand</b> <b>axes,</b> chopping tools and trihedral picks are considered core utensils, which were commonly manufactured out of stones, blocks or rock nodules. However this grouping is problematic as these tools were often also fabricated from (large) flakes. Another common suggestion is to refer to flake tools as micro industry, {{as opposed to the}} more general size referred to as macro industry, which includes <b>hand</b> <b>axes</b> and cleavers. However, some scrapers are as big as <b>hand</b> <b>axes.</b>|$|R
50|$|Cleavers are {{a little}} like <b>hand</b> <b>axes.</b> They are large and oblong or U-shaped tools meant {{to be held in}} the hand, but unlike <b>hand</b> <b>axes,</b> they have a wide, {{straight}} cutting edge running at right angles to the axis of the tool.|$|R
25|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>axes</b> {{dating from}} the lower Palaeolithic {{were found on the}} Asian continent, on the Indian subcontinent and in the Middle East (to the south of Parallel 40° N), but they were absent from the area to the east of the 90° E meridian. Movius {{designated}} a border (the so-called Movius Line) between the cultures that used <b>hand</b> <b>axes</b> to the west and those that made chopping tools and small retouched lithic flakes, such as were made by Peking man and the Ordos culture in China, or their equivalents in Indochina such as the Hoabinhian. The Padjitanian culture from Java was traditionally thought to be the only oriental culture to manufacture <b>hand</b> <b>axes.</b> However, a site in Baise, China shows that <b>hand</b> <b>axes</b> were made in eastern Asia.|$|R
25|$|Other {{theories}} {{suggest the}} shape is part tradition and part by-product of its manufacture. Many early hand axes {{appear to be}} made from simple rounded pebbles (from river or beach deposits), {{it is necessary to}} detach a 'starting flake', often much larger {{than the rest of the}} flakes (due to the oblique angle of a rounded pebble requiring greater force to detach it), thus creating an asymmetry. Correcting the asymmetry by removing material from the other faces, encouraged a more pointed (oval) form factor. (Knapping a completely circular <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> requires considerable correction of the shape.) Studies in the 1990s at Boxgrove, in which a butcher attempted to cut up a carcass with a <b>hand</b> <b>axe,</b> revealed that the <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> was able to expose bone marrow.|$|E
25|$|Older hand axes were {{produced}} by direct percussion with a stone hammer {{and can be}} distinguished by their thickness and a sinuous border. Mousterian hand axes {{were produced}} with a soft billet of antler or wood and are much thinner, more symmetrical and have a straight border. An experienced flintknapper needs less than 15 minutes to produce a good quality <b>hand</b> <b>axe.</b> A simple <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> {{can be made from}} a beach pebble in less than 3 minutes.|$|E
25|$|The {{importance}} of the flint assemblage of Happisburgh {{is not just to}} the understanding the prehistory of Norfolk, but to the understanding of prehistoric Europe. This is due to the first mentioned <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> in the assemblage. The <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> is an ovate handaxe made from black flint with pale grey coarse-grained inclusions, one face carries two small areas of pebble cortex, and is in near perfect condition. This handaxe {{is believed to be the}} earliest tool yet found in Europe; it was probably used as a knife for cutting up carcasses.|$|E
2500|$|The use-wear {{analysis}} of Palaeolithic <b>hand</b> <b>axes</b> {{is carried out}} on findings from emblematic sites across nearly all of Western Europe. Keeley and Semenov were the pioneers of this specialized investigation. Keeley stated, [...] "The morphology of typical <b>hand</b> <b>axes</b> suggests a greater range of potential activities than those of flakes".|$|R
2500|$|Profile—By definition, <b>hand</b> <b>axes</b> have {{a roughly}} {{balanced}} outline, with a morphological axis that {{also serves as}} an axis of bilateral symmetry and a plane that serves as an axis of bifacial symmetry. Not all <b>hand</b> <b>axes</b> are perfectly symmetrical. Symmetry was achieved only after millennia of development. Symmetry may not make tools more useful. <b>Hand</b> <b>axes</b> were used {{in a variety of}} heavy physical tasks. They deteriorated, wore out and broke and were often repaired with retouching of their edges, recovery of their points or complete reworking. The majority of discovered pieces are remains, pieces that have been discarded after a long life as tools, during which they often were damaged and/or adapted for specialized tasks. Such pieces may have lost whatever symmetry they initially had. <b>Hand</b> <b>axes</b> profiles can be classified into the following categories: ...|$|R
25|$|The most {{elaborated}} chopping {{tools and}} partial <b>hand</b> <b>axes</b> are linked {{and it is}} often difficult to distinguish between them. The concept of chopping tools is based on their lack of formal standardization (which is typical of <b>hand</b> <b>axes)</b> and includes the possibility that the pieces are shallow cores, which is unthinkable for the bifaces (except the nucleiforms).|$|R
25|$|Lastly, a <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> {{represents}} a prototype {{that can be}} refined giving rise to more developed, specialised and sophisticated tools such as the tips of various projectiles, knives, adzes and hatchets.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hand</b> <b>axe</b> {{tools were}} {{possibly}} used to butcher animals; to dig for tubers, animals and water; to chop wood and remove tree bark; to throw at prey; {{and as a}} source for flake tools.|$|E
25|$|Baker {{suggested}} that the <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> was not itself a tool, but a core from which flakes had been removed and used as tools (flake core theory). However, hand axes are often found with retouching such as sharpening or shaping, casting doubt on this idea.|$|E
25|$|Many partially-worked <b>hand</b> <b>axes</b> do {{not require}} further work {{in order to be}} {{effective}} tools. They can be considered to be simple <b>hand</b> <b>axes.</b> Less suitable tool stone requires more thorough working. In some specimens the cortex is unrecognisable due to the complete working that it has undergone, which has eliminated any vestige of the original cortex.|$|R

25|$|Hand axes {{are most}} {{commonly}} made from rounded pebbles or nodules, {{but many are}} also made from a large flake. Hand axes made from flakes first appeared {{at the start of}} the Acheulean period and became more common with time. Manufacturing a <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> from a flake is actually easier than from a pebble, it is also quicker as flakes are more likely to be closer to the desired shape. This allows easier manipulation and fewer knaps are required to finish the tool, it is also easier to obtain straight edges. When analysing a <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> made from a flake it should be remembered that its shape was predetermined (by use of the Levallois technique or Kombewa technique or similar). Notwithstanding this, it is necessary to note tools characteristics: type of flake, heel, knap direction.|$|E
25|$|In summary, hand axes are {{recognized}} by many typological schools under different archaeological paradigms and are quite recognisable (at least the most typical examples). However, {{they have not}} been definitively categorized. Stated more formally, the idealised model combines a series of well-defined properties, but no set of these properties are necessary or sufficient to identify a <b>hand</b> <b>axe.</b>|$|E
25|$|In North America, hand axes make {{up one of}} the {{dominant}} tool industries, starting from the terminal Pleistocene and continuing throughout the Holocene. For example, the Folsom point and Clovis point traditions (collectively known as the fluted points) are associated with Paleo Indians, some of the first people to colonize the new world. <b>Hand</b> <b>axe</b> technology is almost unknown in Australian prehistory.|$|E

25|$|The apogee of <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> {{manufacture}} {{took place}} in a wide area of the Old World, especially during the Riss glaciation, in a cultural complex that can be described as cosmopolitan and which is known as the Acheulean. The use of hand axes survived the Middle Palaeolithic in a much smaller area and were especially important during the Mousterian, up {{to the middle of the}} Last glacial period.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> played helped {{establish}} that early humans {{were capable of}} constructing relatively sophisticated tools that also reflected a sense of aesthetics. The 19th century publications of Frere, and more importantly of Boucher de Perthes, in France, described pieces that were balanced, symmetrical and crafted with a formal purity. Vilanova i Piera published similar works in Spain. This work was continued by Pérez de Barradas and del Prado {{at the start of}} the 20th Century.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} {{analysis of a}} <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> tries to discover each of the phases in its chaîne opératoire (operational sequence). The chain is highly flexible as a toolmaker may focus narrowly on {{just one of the}} sequence's links or equally on each link. The links examined in this type of study start with the extraction methods of the raw material, then include the actual manufacture of the item, its use, maintenance throughout its working life and finally its disposal.|$|E

25|$|Hand axes have {{traditionally}} been oriented with their narrowest part upwards (presupposing that {{this would have been}} the most active part, which is not unreasonable given the many hand axes that have unworked bases). The following typological conventions to facilitate communications. The axis of symmetry that divides a biface in two is called the morphological axis. The main face is usually the most regular and better worked. The base (not the heel) is the bottom of the <b>hand</b> <b>axe.</b>|$|E
25|$|Given the typological {{difficulties}} {{in defining the}} essence of a <b>hand</b> <b>axe,</b> it is important when analysing them to take account of their archaeological context (geographical location, stratigraphy, the presence of other elements associated with the same level, chronology etc.). It is necessary to study their physical state to establish any natural alterations that may have occurred: patina, shine, wear and tear, mechanical, thermal and / or physical-chemical changes such as cracking, in order to distinguish these factors from the scars left during the tool's manufacture or use.|$|E
25|$|Hand axes {{were the}} first prehistoric tools to be {{recognized}} as such: the first published representation of a <b>hand</b> <b>axe</b> was drawn by John Frere and appeared in a British publication in 1800. Until that time, their origins were thought to be natural or supernatural. They were called thunderstones, because popular tradition held that they had fallen from the sky during storms or were formed inside the earth by a lightning strike and then appeared at the surface. They are used in some rural areas as an amulet to protect against storms.|$|E

25|$|The most {{characteristic}} {{and common}} shape is a pointed area at one end, cutting edges along its {{side and a}} rounded base (this includes <b>hand</b> <b>axes</b> with a lanceolate and amygdaloidal shape {{as well as others}} from the family). <b>Hand</b> <b>axes</b> display a variety of shapes, including circular, triangular and elliptical. They are typically between 8 and 15cm in length, although they can be bigger or smaller.|$|R
