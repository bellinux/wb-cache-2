40|$|Digitization and {{the growing}} {{importance}} of online environments require specific approaches for analyzing and managing e-brands. With a focus on pure players websites, the aim of our study is to analyze the main determinants of users <b>e-brand</b> attitudes. In doing so, our study considers three key variables relating to <b>e-brand</b> attitudes: interactivity, personalization and e-trust. A quantitative empirical study was conducted, and {{data were analyzed using}} structural equation modeling. The results show that the key determinants of user attitudes toward e-brands are interactivity (indirect) and personalization (direct). To a lesser extent, e-trust is a factor that has a significant effect on <b>e-brand</b> attitudes. Furthermore, it is the interrelationships among these constructs that are of particular interest. This study could serve both as a theoretical reference point for future research and as a managerial tool for the integrated evaluation of the multidimensional relationships among <b>e-brand</b> attitude key drivers. © 2012 Macmillan Publishers Ltd...|$|E
40|$|Although {{commercial}} internet {{has been around}} for over a decade, and a vast amount of practitioner and scholarly literature on internet marketing activities of firms has accumulated, relatively little empirical work has been undertaken on the branding strategies of internet companies.

It contributes by providing rare empirical insights into the e-branding phenomenon, which complement the extant, mainly anecdotal, best practice literature. Analysis results suggest a widespread appreciation of the importance of e-branding, and a prevalence of collaborative and customer-centric <b>e-brand</b> building strategies, including co-branding and affiliating with established online and offline brands, distribution partnerships, content alliances and personalised e-mail contacts. The examined internet companies also seem to have employed a variety of traditional, offline methods and leading-edge online tools in communicating their key <b>e-brand</b> values and promoting their online platforms and offerings. These communication vehicles included newspapers, radio, magazines, television, public relations, trade events and promotions, personalised e-mail notifications, affiliate programmes with other websites and banner advertisements. It further emerged that a few of the study companies had taken major steps towards internationalising their e-brands, and had responded appropriately to the concomitant localisation/adaptation challenges.

Why are some <b>e-brands</b> better than other <b>e-brands?</b> At the same time, <b>e-brands</b> are a particularly useful way of studying corporate brands because the 2 ̆ 7 entire 2 ̆ 7 corporation appears on a screen in front of you.

40|$|Despite the {{economic}} significance non-profit organizations (NPOs) have acquired in recent years, {{the implications of}} the Internet for NPO marketing seem to have received only little attention from both researchers and practi tioners. Although NPO marketing {{has been the subject of}} academic research for more than 30 years, NPO brand 2 ̆ 7 ing has been studied for just about 10 years (cf. Hankinson, 2001). Recent research on branding in the nonprofit s«:ctor includes, for example, an assessment of the impact of brand orientation on non-profit performance (Hanldnson, 2001; Hankinson, 2002) and the development of a non-profit brand orientation scale (Ewing and Napoli 200 ^ 1). In particular, the small body of literature on <b>e-branding</b> for NPOs calls for an investigation into <b>e-branding</b> stratsgie:s for NPOs. Ruscli (2002) rhetorically asks if investing in a brand can be seen as a frivolous activity for NPOs in view of their not-for-profit mission, but he concludes that a better understanding of NPO branding will lead to a more effective use of their donations, which eventually furthers the NPOs 2 ̆ 7 causes. Although the peculiar organizational structure of NPOs fosters creativity and innovation, they often lack the motivation to exploit these opportunities commercially. Also, it seems that NPOs have not yet seized the opportunity to fully integrate the Internet into their busraess processes with a view to enhancing their core competencies, even though NPOs - particularly educational institutions - vrere actually the first organizations to use the Internet (Clay, 2002). Based on the assumption that well thought-out strategies for internal and extemal communication will help NPOs to build such <b>e-brands,</b> this paper begins with an outline of relevant aspects of both NPOs and e-communication. The main argument put forward in this paper is that successful <b>e-branding</b> for NPOs is determined by the aligmnent of intra-organizational and extemal communication capabilities. The conceptual framework for NPO <b>e-branding</b> we arrived at is based on qualitative inten 2 ̆ 7 iews with NPOs from different sectors and an examination of their public Web sites. The paper concludes with hands-on recommendations for NPO communication strategies and suggestions for further research...|$|R

The paper {{is consistent with the}} perspective on IS-enabled organizational capabilities and resource based view of the firm. A questionnaire-based survey was conducted to collect data from 204 supply chain, logistics, or procurement/ purchasing managers of manufacturing firms. Findings show that supply chain process integration, a key EC-enabled organizational capability, can enhance business value. Additionally, the capability serve as a catalyst in transforming technical EC-based IS resources (technical quality of EC applications, EC advancements, EC alignment and <b>E-branding)</b> into higher value for a firm. Our results suggest that supply chain process integration is an important intermediate organizational capability through which value of EC-based IS resources can be materialized. However, the technical aspects of EC-based IS resources needs to developed to effectively form supply chain capabilities.

It tackles the questions related to destination <b>e-branding</b> expressed through web marketing of city brand identity and city brand image of ten European capitals (Rome, Paris, Berlin, Brussels, Helsinki, Lisbon, London, Madrid, Warsaw, and Vienna). The data derives from asynchronous and interactive e-tourism communication channels. City brand identity is created by the marketers through institutional tourist websites as official visiting cards presented to tourists. This exploratory study examines their usability, interactivity, contents, and references to the social networks. City brand image is operationalized through data retrieved from forum discussions on the TripAdvisor portal, identifying the main places of the European capitals targeted by social representations charged with symbolic values and emotional attributions, and examining evaluations of these capitals expressed and negotiated {{by the members of}} the web communities during spontaneous conversations and free exchanges of their experiences. The main results include detecting a higher communicative capacity of the institutional tourist websites of the northern European capitals than the southern ones, verified {{for the majority of the}} cities considered.

40|$|The {{majority}} of enterprises {{are aware of}} the significant factors of customer loyalty. However, the customers´ own perspective is often ignored. Consequently, a lot of companies aren't able to create the optimal "loyalty-mix" with corresponding drawbacks in the customers loyalty. Reason is often the imperative of the product, often strengthened by an organization related on products and not on customer divisions. The diploma thesis aims at an identification {{of the state of the}} art of instruments for electronic customer loyalty, called e-loyalty. One major result of the thesis is the identification of at least five e-loyalty-factors which are implemented by well-known companies and are presently dominating the market of customer retention: Vision and management strategy, <b>e-branding,</b> community building, individualization/ interactivity and process design. Each of these e-loyalty-factor is discussed in detail by a variety of case studies of reputable or innovative enterprises. For instance, the diploma thesis analyse the websites of the Kraft-Jacobs-Suchhard brand Milka concerning design, tonality, added value and usability as a best practice solution. The computer manufacturer Dell is represented as a specialist in tailoring personal computers by mass customization as well as process design of its enterprise processes. However, before a loyal customer behaviour is achieved, companies are recommended to concentrate on customers´ perspective, to come up to their expectations in order to create real customer satisfaction which represents the basis for loyalty.

40|$|Cynics {{sometimes}} {{refer to}} the insurance industry as boring, old-fashioned and bureaucratic. What can Zurich do to challenge such misconceptions and better market themselves to potential graduate applicants?” In recent times, {{there has been a}} noticeable shortfall in graduate level applications to insurance firms. The industry is now facing problems of an ageing workforce and are undergoing difficulty attracting graduates, as compared to other industry sectors such as a banking, finance, law, engineering, public sector and more. 	Speaking to graduates, Zurich Financial Services (a prominent global insurance solutions provider) found that certain misconceptions were held against the Insurance industry; primarily that it was Old Fashioned, Bureaucratic and Boring. 	To refute these fallacies, this thesis considered a key constituent of the marketing strategy towards graduates: Zurich’s online presence. To this end, a new e-marketing and <b>e-branding</b> strategy was developed by following a customer decision framework and modelling graduate jobseekers as customers. The framework outlines how a consumer first gains brand Awareness, leading to them conducting a Search for more information, Evaluating the product and alternatives, making a Purchase decision and then displaying Loyalty to the company. 	Throughout this process, appropriate online marketing solutions were recommended, which combined to form an entirely new e-marketing strategy. The key findings were firstly; simply having a presence on current, fashionable social networking sites is not enough – consumers must be offered value. 	Secondly, the misconceptions occur as a consequence of a lack of information and true facts on the consumer’s part. Therefore more work needs be done by insurance firms to demonstrate how they are attractive and offer value, not only to consumers but also for graduates seeking to build a career. This is achieved through strategic brand positioning. 	Thirdly, combining the first two points, Zurich must seek to build a brand relationship with a younger demographic, by involving them in direct consumer to business interactions. This is undertaken through cutting-edge e-marketing solutions such as viral marketing, crowdsourcing and community building. This will eradicate the Old Fashioned myth, and lead to younger consumers learning more about the company and industry, thereby extinguishing the Boring and Bureaucratic untruths...|$|R
40|$|In the past, {{portfolios}} {{were shown}} in paper folders; however, although the traditional media {{can live with}} digital media, we cannot forget {{the importance of having}} a digital portfolio and a good visibility and online presence, opening our cv to employers who want to meet possible employees, not only in a national market, but international, with an economic crisis context, where mobility is no longer a problem when it comes to search and find a job, but in many cases, the solution. When we talk about an e- branding plan, we are referring to the constitution of a personal brand and its visibility, positioning, reputation and communication on internet; through a digital portfolio, we can show and spread our personal brand. There are many important reasons for creating our own portfolio and e- branding plan; first, its important to stay in the online world, which has already become a precedent for our presentation in the physical world. We can be known on internet and to extend our professional network of contacts in a specific sector in an easier and faster way than if we would had {{to do it in a}} personal way; it gives us added value in a current professional context of high competition and finally, it gives us access to specialized information which would be more difficult to find without having a digital portfolio and a personal brand. " Know yourself " would be the first step to begin creating a strategy and a portfolio of <b>e-branding</b> plan; it is impossible to build a personal brand plan without knowing our strengths and weaknesses, to emphasize the former and minimize the latter. In addition, we have to be clear about what we offer to the labor market and in what we are specialists; all considering " threats " and "opportunities " that we may face in the workplace, particularly in the professional field to which we must focus professionally. The next question we should ask ourselves is why I want to build my portfolio and my e- branding plan, what goal or goals intend to achieve with it: promote our reputation ? To have digital visibility in order to obtain a job ? maintain our image and business contacts ? To change our current work ? As a result, we have to keep updated our portfolio as well as our digital presence. Then we should set our target and our work sector. Finally, we have to decide through what tactics and tools we intend to achieve our goal : the creation of our portfolio and e- branding plan.
