25|$|The <b>floor</b> <b>selector</b> lever {{also has}} an S position. When S is selected, sport mode is {{activated}} in the DSG. Sport mode still functions as a fully automatic mode, identical in operation to D mode, but upshifts and downshifts are made much higher up the engine rev-range. This aids a more sporty driving manner, by utilising considerably more of the available engine power, and also maximising engine braking. However, this mode does have a detrimental effect on the vehicle fuel consumption, when compared to D mode. This mode may not be ideal to use when wanting to drive in a sedate manner; nor when road conditions are very slippery, due to ice, snow or torrential rain â€” because loss of tire traction may be experienced (wheel spin during acceleration, and may also result in road wheel locking during downshifts at high engine rpms under closed throttle). On 4motion or quattro-equipped vehicles this may be partially offset by the drivetrain maintaining full-time engagement of the rear differential in S mode, so power distribution under loss of front-wheel traction may be marginally improved.|$|E
50|$|The front brakes became discs {{and from}} 1964 it gained a new gearbox with {{synchromesh}} on first gear. The optional Borg Warner automatic got a <b>floor</b> mounted <b>selector</b> lever.|$|R
50|$|The alternators were {{connected}} to 66 kV 3-phase delta-star transformers. The main 66 kV switchgear, rated at 2,500 MVA, was on the three upper floors of the switch-house: the circuit breakers on the upper <b>floor,</b> the <b>selector</b> switches below and the bus-bars on the lower floor. Two 66 kV cables ran to Battersea power station, and two to Deptford power station. Ten 22 kV cables and twelve 11 kV cables distributed to various sub-stations of the London Electricity Board.|$|R
5000|$|In 1977 GAZ {{launched}} its {{successor to the}} GAZ-13, the GAZ-14 Chaika. The new limousine had a more powerful engine, 220 hp, and its transmission was revised. Like for the GAZ-24, the central transmission brake was removed, but unlike the sedan, it now had a parking pin. The <b>floor</b> mounted <b>selector</b> got an international P-R-N-D-2-1 lettering. Regime [...] "1" [...] now operated first gear only, via the rear band, whilst regime [...] "2" [...] locked out the first gear (like on the original GAZ-21 Volga). Gear ratios were now 2.35 - 1.0 for torque coverter, 2.64 for first gear, 1.55 for second, third remained direct, and reverse became 2.0. The car was produced from 1977 until 1989. In 1981 GAZ launched {{what was to be}} a successor to the GAZ-24, but separated into a separate model and built alongside the -24, the GAZ-3102 Volga. It too gained a [...] "chaser" [...] modification - GAZ-31013 with the 220 hp engine from the GAZ-14, and its transmission, adopted to Volga's body. This model was built until 1996.|$|R
5000|$|In 1970 GAZ-21 Volga was {{replaced}} by GAZ-24 and the V8 adoption followed soon, dubbed GAZ-24-24. As the sedan's standard gearbox was now a four on the <b>floor</b> manual, the <b>selector</b> lever was accordingly altered. Unofficially these cars were called [...] "Chasers", and despite their novelty, the engine torque was disproportional to the chassis ability (to prevent excessive burnouts, the factory improvised by adding a 100 kg metal plate into the boot rather than altering the suspension design). This meant a very low service life and also required very professional driving. For that reason, the factory did not even bother creating a special select indicator, and externally it resembled a manual transmission gearshift lever (some cars even lacked a single brake pedal, and instead had the clutch/brake pedal layout that dubbed each other). The GAZ-24 had the common cord-actuated parking brakes, thus the central shaft brake was removed and replaced by an extension housing to fit the shorter driveshaft of the GAZ-24. GAZ-24-24 would be produced alongside standard GAZ-24 until 1985. That year the car got a major facelift and internal modernisation with engine and chassis elements from the GAZ-3102 Volga, resulting in the GAZ-24-10 model. The Chaser became GAZ-24-34 and was produced until 1993.|$|R
