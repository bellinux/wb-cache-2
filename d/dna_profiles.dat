40|$|Deposited with {{permission}} of the author. © 1994 Jane Moira TaupinThe innovative forensic technique of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> has been acclaimed {{as the most important}} advance in forensic science since fingerprinting. Whilst there is much anecdotal information on the impact of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> on criminal investigation, prosecution and adjudication, there is little quantitative and control comparison data on the routine use of forensic <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling.</b> This study evaluates the effect of the introduction of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> in Victoria on a number of key points in the criminal justice system. The overall impact of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was low as determined by the percentage of criminal cases which utilise <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling.</b> However, in certain classes of cases its impact was measurable, most notably in sex offences committed by “strangers”. Less than one quarter of sexual offence cases of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiled</b> resulted in a contested trial, suggesting that the focus of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> on the criminal justice system should swing to the pre-trial phase. <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was most often used in sexual offence cases and a database comparison of these cases before and after the advent of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was examined. Whilst not statistically significant, trends indicated there were more solved cases, more guilty pleas and fewer trials after the introduction of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling,</b> but more individuals were drawn into the investigatory process. The number of trials of sexual offences in which consent was an issue was slightly greater than previously. The increase in guilty pleas with <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> was only for stranger type crime. Further research is recommended as <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> becomes the cornerstone of biological forensic analysis. Open Acces...|$|R
2500|$|<b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> (also called <b>DNA</b> fingerprinting, DNA testing, or DNA typing) is {{the process}} of {{determining}} an individual's DNA characteristics, called a <b>DNA</b> <b>profile,</b> that is very likely to be different in unrelated individuals, thereby being as unique to individuals as are fingerprints (hence the alternative name for the technique). <b>DNA</b> <b>profiling</b> {{should not be confused with}} full genome sequencing.|$|R

25|$|Since 1998, the DNA {{profiling}} system supported by The National DNA Database in the UK is the SGM+ DNA {{profiling system}} that includes 10 STR regions and a sex-indicating test. STRs do not suffer from such subjectivity and provide similar {{power of discrimination}} (1 in 1013 for unrelated individuals if using a full SGM+ profile). Figures of this magnitude are {{not considered to be}} statistically supportable by scientists in the UK; for unrelated individuals with full matching <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> a match probability of 1 in a billion is considered statistically supportable. However, with any DNA technique, the cautious juror should not convict on genetic fingerprint evidence alone if other factors raise doubt. Contamination with other evidence (secondary transfer) is a key source of incorrect <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> and raising doubts as to whether a sample has been adulterated is a favorite defense technique. More rarely, chimerism is one such instance where the lack of a genetic match may unfairly exclude a suspect.|$|E

However, some grape geneticist and ampelographers such as José Vouillamoz dispute the 2006 findings and believe that the <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> of both grapes are too distinct to have a close parent-offspring relationship at all. It is more likely, Vouillamoz and others suggest, that Carignan and Graciano were the result of two separate spontaneous crossing of unknown Vitis vinifera parents that occurred somewhere in northeast Spain.|$|E
25|$|In October 2011, Cook County Sheriff Thomas Dart {{announced}} that investigators, having obtained full <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> {{from each of}} the unidentified victims, were to renew their efforts to identify all of them. At a press conference held to announce this intention, Sheriff Dart stated investigators are actively seeking DNA samples from individuals across the United States related to any male missing between 1970 and 1979. Test results thus far conducted have confirmed the identification of two victims, ruled out the possibility of numerous other missing youths as being victims of Gacy, and solved four unrelated cold cases dating between 1972 and 1979.|$|E
25|$|The CODIS {{database}} contains {{several different}} indexes for {{the storage of}} DNA profile information.

Additional indexes, such as the unidentified human remain index, the missing persons index, and the biological relatives of missing persons index, are used to assist in identifying missing persons. Specialty indexes also exist for other specimens that don't fall into the other categories. These indexes include the staff index, for profiles of employees who work with the samples, and the multi-allelic offender index, for single-source samples that have three or more alleles at two or more loci.|$|E

25|$|In practice, {{the risk}} of contaminated-{{matching}} {{is much greater than}} matching a distant relative, such as contamination of a sample from nearby objects, or from left-over cells transferred from a prior test. The risk is greater for matching the most common person in the samples: Everything collected from, or in contact with, a victim is a major source of contamination for any other samples brought into a lab. For that reason, multiple control-samples are typically tested {{in order to ensure that}} they stayed clean, when prepared during the same period as the actual test samples. Unexpected matches (or variations) in several control-samples indicates a high probability of contamination for the actual test samples. In a relationship test, the full <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> should differ (except for twins), to prove that a person was not actually matched as being related to their own DNA in another sample.|$|E
25|$|The {{creation}} of a national DNA database within the U.S. was first mentioned by the Technical Working Group on DNA Analysis Methods (TWGDAM) in 1989. In 1990, the FBI began a pilot DNA databasing program with 14 state and local laboratories. In 1994, Congress passed the DNA Identification Act which authorized the FBI to create a national DNA database of convicted offenders as well as separate databases for missing persons and forensic samples collected from crime scenes. The Act also required that laboratories participating in the CODIS program maintain accreditation from an independent nonprofit organization that is {{actively involved in the}} forensic fields and that scientists processing DNA samples for submission into CODIS maintain proficiency and are routinely tested to ensure the quality of the profiles being uploaded into the database. The national level of CODIS (NDIS) was implemented in October 1998. Today, all 50 states, the District of Columbia, federal law enforcement, the Army Laboratory, and Puerto Rico participate in the national sharing of <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles.</b>|$|E
25|$|The eastern wolf {{was first}} {{recognized}} as a distinct species in 1775 by German naturalist Johann Schreber, who termed it loup noir (black wolf). His depiction of the animal however showed it with a black coat, an atypical coloration in eastern wolves. It was later reclassified as a subspecies of gray wolf by Edward Nelson and Goldman. In 2000, the taxonomic status of the eastern wolf was once again brought into question when a genetic study on canids from Algonquin Provincial Park undertaken in Trent University showed that the local wolves bore similarities to red wolves, based on <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> at eight microsatellite loci. Furthermore, sequences were found in both eastern and red wolves that diverged from those of coyotes by 150,000–300,000 years, and no specimens of either species from the 1960s bore any gray wolf mitochondrial DNA. The scientists involved in this study proposed that the eastern and red wolf were the same species, and that the two be combined under the earlier binomial name of C. lycaon. However, this conclusion was disputed, with one study indicating that the eastern wolf is a gray wolf–coyote hybrid and Mammal Species of the World listed it in 2005 as a subspecies of gray wolf.|$|E

25|$|Pinot gris is a Pinot color sport (and {{can arise}} by {{mutation}} of Pinot noir or Pinot blanc), presumably representing a somatic mutation {{in either the}} VvMYBA1 or VvMYBA2 genes that control grape berry color. Pinot blanc is a further mutation and can either naturally arise from or give rise to Pinot gris or Pinot noir; the mutation–reversion path is multi-directional therefore. The general <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> of both Pinot gris and blanc are identical to Pinot noir; and other Pinots, Pinot moure and Pinot teinturier, are also genetically similarly close. It should be noted therefore that almost any given Pinot (of whatever berry color) can occur as a complete mutation or as a chimera of almost any other Pinot As such, suggestions that Pinot noir is the fundamental and original form of the Pinots are both misleading and highly tendentious. Indeed, if anything, Pinot blanc may be the original human-selected form of Pinot, although given the genetic variability of this longstanding genetic line, thinking of Pinot as a familial cluster of grapes sharing a fundamental and common genetic core is almost certainly nearest the truth. It is this 'core' around which the sub-varietally identifying color variations (blanc, rouge, noir, gris, rose, violet, tenteurier, moure, etc.) occur, along with the more striking chimeric morphological mutation that is Pinot Meunier, and the interesting further mutations of this variety as Pinot Meunier gris and as the non-hairy mutation which the Germans classify as 'Samtrot' (effectively 'Pinot red velvet').|$|E

2500|$|On {{the anniversary}} of Kelly's hanging, 11 November 2009, Tom Baxter handed the skull in his {{possession}} to police and it was historically and forensically tested along with the Pentridge remains. The skull was compared to a cast of the skull that had been stolen from the Old Melbourne Gaol in 1978 and {{proved to be a}} match. The skull was then compared to that in a newspaper photograph of worker Alex Talbot holding the skull recovered in 1929 which showed a close resemblance. Talbot was known to have taken a tooth from the skull as a souvenir and a media campaign to find the whereabouts of the tooth led to Talbot's grandson coming forward. The tooth was found to belong to the skull confirming it was indeed the skull recovered in 1929. In 2004, before the skull was handed to police, a cast of the skull was made and compared to the death masks of those executed at Old Melbourne Gaol which eliminated all but two. The two were those of Kelly and Ernest Knox, who had been executed in March 1894 (headstone marked E.K., 19–3–94) and buried near Frederick Deeming (headstone marked with the initials A.W. and a D underneath). In April 1929, the skulls of the E.K. marked grave (which was thought at the time to belong to Kelly) and Frederick Deeming were looted from the excavated graves. The death mask of Knox and a facial reconstruction of a cast of the skull were a close match. In 2010 and 2011, the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine performed a series of craniofacial super-imposition, CT scanning, anthropology and DNA tests on the skull recovered from the E.K. marked grave and concluded it was not Kelly's. [...] In 2014, the remains of Frederick Deeming's brother was exhumed from Bebington cemetery and tissue samples were obtained from the femur bone. A DNA profile was successfully obtained from the samples and compared with a DNA profile that had been previously obtained from the skull that was stolen from the Old Melbourne Gaol. The <b>DNA</b> <b>profiles</b> did not match, conclusively proving that the skull is not Deeming's. [...] It is now accepted that the skull recovered in 1929 and later displayed in the Old Melbourne Gaol was not Kelly's or Deeming's.|$|E
