25|$|The elder monk then {{referred}} Zhang and Wang {{to another}} place called Fuzhun Monastery (福泉庵), less than a half mile from where they were. The two hurried to Fuzhun Monastery. There, the abbot, with his gray hair and beard glowing under the sun, looked extremely dignified and holy. After listening to their explanation, <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> in agreement.|$|E

"So I {{went back}} to Hughes, and told him I'd been able to persuade Hecht to do his script; I told him Ben's terms, - $1,000 per day - and Howard didn't blink an eye. <b>He</b> <b>nodded,</b> and said, 'Okay-it's a deal. But you tell Hecht I want a real tough shoot-'em up script that'll knock the {{audience}} out of its seats, okay?' ...|$|E
2500|$|In the Katamon quarter, we {{were held}} up by a Jewish Army type jeep placed in a road block and filled with men in Jewish Army uniforms. At the same moment, I saw an armed man coming from this jeep. I took little notice of this because I merely thought it was another checkpoint. However, he put a Tommy gun {{through the open window}} on my side of the car, and fired point blank at Count Bernadotte and Colonel Serot. I also heard shots fired from other points, and there was {{considerable}} confusion... Colonel Serot fell in the seat in back of me, and I saw at once that he was dead. Count Bernadotte bent forward, and I thought {{at the time he was}} trying to get cover. I asked him: 'Are you wounded?' <b>He</b> <b>nodded,</b> and fell back.... When we arrived ... I carried the Count inside and laid him on the bed.... I took off the Count's jacket and tore away his shirt and undervest. I saw that he was wounded around the heart and that there was also a considerable quantity of blood on his clothes about it. When the doctor arrived, I asked if anything could be done, but he replied that it was too late.|$|E

2500|$|Dev Anand and Suraiya met Peck for {{the first}} time at Mumbai's Willingdon Club, after the Filmfare Awards in 1954, on Peck's {{stopover}} from a schedule at Sri Lanka after shooting for The Purple Plain. He knew of the [...] "Indian Star" [...] as an actor, more so probably because his romance with Suraiya was grabbing the headlines, and they had a chat. The second time they met was in Rome when Dev Anand was on his way back from the Venice Film Festival, he visited him on the set of Roman Holiday. [...] "I was returning from the Venice film fest. I stopped my car and joined the crowd watching the shoot, hoping that his eyes would fall on me. As expected, <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> and I walked up to him. He remembered me and we exchanged pleasantries." [...] The third meeting was at London on the set of Moby Dick. However, Suraiya asked for an exclusive meeting with her idol at her house. Though Anand says jealousy was natural for anyone in love, he didn't mind that he was not invited. [...] "I didn't quite feel anything. It wasn't as if they were going to fall in love or make love. Even if they would have, it wouldn't have mattered. I was mature enough. Moreover, he wasn't my rival. I too was a big star by then," [...] says Anand.|$|E
2500|$|Tsar Nicholas II, {{the last}} Emperor of Russia, {{reported}} witnessing {{what he called}} [...] "a fiery ball" [...] while {{in the company of}} his grandfather, Tsar Alexander II: [...] "Once my parents were away," [...] recounted the Tsar, [...] "and I was at the all-night vigil with my grandfather in the small church in Alexandria. During the service there was a powerful thunderstorm, streaks of lightning flashed one after the other, and {{it seemed as if the}} peals of thunder would shake even the church and the whole world to its foundations. Suddenly it became quite dark, a blast of wind from the open door blew out the flame of the candles which were lit in front of the iconostasis, there was a long clap of thunder, louder than before, and I suddenly saw a fiery ball flying from the window straight towards the head of the Emperor. The ball (it was of lightning) whirled around the floor, then passed the chandelier and flew out through the door into the park. My heart froze, I glanced at my grandfather– his face was completely calm. He crossed himself just as calmly as he had when the fiery ball had flown near us, and I felt that it was unseemly and not courageous to be frightened as I was. I felt that one had only to look at what was happening and believe in the mercy of God, as he, my grandfather, did. After the ball had passed through the whole church, and suddenly gone out through the door, I again looked at my grandfather. A faint smile was on his face, and <b>he</b> <b>nodded</b> his head at me. My panic disappeared, and from that time I had no more fear of storms." ...|$|E
