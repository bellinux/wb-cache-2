After recovering from her suicide attempt, Edie discovers that Carlos has $10 million in an offshore bank account.

5|$|Hiroshi tells Hsing {{that he and}} {{a handful}} of allies, who believe that the people on the ship should stop at Hsin Ti Chiu, <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>keeping</b> news of the {{acceleration}} secret. They believe that hiding the knowledge of the schedule provides them a weapon against the angels, who do not wish the ship to stop at all. Hsing becomes a reluctant party to the conspiracy, but is distressed by its secrecy and what she considers to be dishonesty, and persuades Hiroshi and his allies to go public with the information. Meanwhile, Luis thoroughly investigates the education program for the sixth generation aboard the ship (the generation supposed to land on Hsin Ti Chiu) and finds that large parts of it have been erased or replaced with propaganda by the angels. Luis succeeds in making the ruling council of the ship launch an investigation into religious manipulation of the education program. Persuaded by Hsing, Hiroshi makes a public statement about the ship's new schedule, while concealing {{the fact that he had}} known about it for a while.|$|E

25|$|The {{agricultural}} industry made a {{recovery in the}} post-World War II years with record setting crops, and the community recovered its municipal services. In {{the last few decades}} the economy has been relatively stagnant, with most of the town's youth leaving to find employment in larger communities. Pressures on farming due to weather and high fuel and equipment costs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>keeping</b> the growth of agriculture in check.|$|E
25|$|For over {{a hundred}} years, {{biologists}} <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>keeping</b> track of populations of different species with population models. Most models are continuous, but recently scientists {{have been able to}} implement chaotic models in certain populations. For example, a study on models of Canadian lynx showed there was chaotic behavior in the population growth. Chaos can also be found in ecological systems, such as hydrology. While a chaotic model for hydrology has its shortcomings, there is still much to learn from looking at the data through the lens of chaos theory. Another biological application is found in cardiotocography. Fetal surveillance is a delicate balance of obtaining accurate information while being as noninvasive as possible. Better models of warning signs of fetal hypoxia can be obtained through chaotic modeling.|$|E
25|$|During the July Crisis Wilson {{was mainly}} {{preoccupied with the}} {{apparent}} imminence of civil war in Ireland, with Carson unwilling to accept anything less than complete exclusion of the Six Counties, and vainly lobbied the new CIGS Charles Douglas to flood the whole of Ireland with troops (29 June). By the end of July {{it was clear that}} the continent was on the brink of hostilities, with Wilson being lobbied by Milner and the diplomat Eyre Crowe about Edward Grey’s reluctance to go to war. Wilson (1 August) called on de la Panouse (French Military Attache) and Paul Cambon (French Ambassador) to discuss the military situation. Wilson may well <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>keeping</b> the Conservative leadership informed of discussions between Cambon and Foreign Secretary Grey. The German invasion of Belgium provided a casus belli and Britain mobilized on 3 August and declared war on 4 August.|$|E

25|$|Forced to {{separate}} from the party, Noctis finally reaches the Crystal, only to be slowly pulled into it. Ardyn then appears and reveals himself to be Ardyn Lucis Caelum, a former healer and king of Lucis who was chosen by the Crystal two thousand years ago. Ardyn had saved Eos by absorbing the Daemons into himself, only to be demonized by Noctis’ ancestors. Rendered immortal by the Daemons' power and denied ascension by the Astrals, Ardyn has since sought revenge on the royal bloodline and the Crystal, hastening {{the onset of the}} Starscourge while waiting for the True King to appear so he could destroy them both. Within the Crystal, Noctis encounters the Astral Bahamut; he learns that he is the True King of prophecy, who will cleanse the Starscourge and restore light to Eos. Noctis prepares himself to fulfill his destiny, knowing that it will cost him his life; upon his return to the mortal realm, he finds that ten years have passed. He reunites with his friends, who <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>keeping</b> the Daemons at bay since Eos’ descent into eternal darkness, before heading to the ruins of Insomnia. After the party defeats the rogue Astral Ifrit, Noctis confronts Ardyn alone and kills him in single combat. Noctis then ascends the throne, and using the power of the Lucii and the Crystal's light sacrifices his life to purge the Starscourge and the Daemons from the world. In the spirit realm, Noctis—with the aid of Lunafreya and the Lucii—destroys Ardyn's spirit.|$|E

500|$|... "Secrets" [...] {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics.

IGN's Eric Goldman evaluated the episode as [...] "satisfying", and added that its character development was executed strongly.

Aaron Rutkoff of The Wall Street Journal echoed synonymous sentiments; [...] "Viewers tuning in each week {{in the hope of}} watching pulse-quickening battles between overmatched humans and armies of the undead are sure to be frustrated. Things are static in an action sense, but the show’s admirably nuanced characters are changing and reacting to the world in surprising and complicated ways." [...] Writing for Cinema Blend, Nick Venable stated that the characters became more distinguishable.|$|E
