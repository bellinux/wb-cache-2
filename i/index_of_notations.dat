40|$|Let H be a Hopf algebra and A be an H-module algebra. This article {{studies the}} smash product A#H {{in terms of}} Calabi-Yau duality. When the antipode of H is {{invertible}} and A and H are homologically smooth, it is proved that A#H has Van den Bergh duality {{if and only if}} so have A and H. Under the same condition, it is proved that if A and H are skew-Calabi-Yau, then so is A#H; A description of a Nakayama automorphism of A#H is given as well as a partial converse to the implication. This leads to necessary and/or sufficient conditions for A#H to be Calabi-Yau. As a byproduct, it is proved that for connected graded Artin-Schelter regular algebras, graded Nakayama automorphisms have trivial homological determinant. The results are illustrated on the smash products of polynomial algebras (or of the quantum plane) by enveloping algebras of finite dimensional Lie algebras (or, by the quantum enveloping algebra of sl(2), respectively). The results in this article are based on the study of the inverse dualising complex of A#H in the more general situation where A is a dg algebra. In that setting, the article studies the interaction between taking the smash product with H of a dg algebra and taking the (deformed) Calabi-Yau completion of a dg algebra. The final part of the article discusses necessary and sufficient conditions for A#H to be Artin-Schelter regular or Gorenstein.

A reader without much prior knowledge about the Baum-Connes Con-jecture or the Farrell-Jones Conjecture should begin with Chapter 1.

40|$|We {{describe}} the periodic orbits of the prefractal Koch snowflake billiard (the nth inner rational polygonal approximation of the Koch snowflake billiard). In {{the case of}} the finite (prefractal) billiard table, we focus on the direction given by an initial angle of pi/ 3, and define 1) a compatible sequence of piecewise Fagnano orbits, 2) an eventually constant compatible sequence of orbits and 3) a compatible sequence of generalized piecewise Fagnano orbits. In {{the case of the}} infinite (fractal) billiard table, we will describe what we call stabilizing periodic orbits of the Koch snowflake fractal billiard. In a sense, we show {{that it is possible to}} define billiard dynamics on a Cantor set. In addition, we will show that the inverse limit of the footprints of orbits of the prefractal approximations exists in a specific situation and provide a plausibility argument as to why such an inverse limit of footprints should constitute the footprint of a well-defined periodic orbit of the fractal billiard. Using known results for the inverse limit of a sequence of finite spaces, we deduce that the footprint (i. e., the intersection of the orbit with the boundary) of a piecewise Fagnano orbit is a topological Cantor set and a self-similar Cantor set. We allude to a possible characterization of orbits with an initial direction of pi/ 3. Such a characterization would allow one to describe an orbit with an initial direction of pi/ 3 of the Koch snowflake billiard as either a piecewise Fagnano orbit, a stabilizing orbit or a generalized piecewise Fagnano orbit. We then close the paper by discussing several outstanding open problems and conjectures about the Koch snowflake fractal billiard, the associated 'fractal flat surface', and possible connections with the associated fractal drum. In the long-term, the present work may help lay the foundations for a general theory of fractal billiards.
