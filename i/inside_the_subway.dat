Since individuals are inevitably exposed to PM concentrations, {{it is crucial to}} study which transport modes present highest health impacts on users in order to provide different and healthier options for daily commutes. For the purpose of estimating PM inhaled doses, this research relates pedestrians’ ventilation rate and ambient PM concentration. The methodology consists on collecting data regarding PM concentrations on a second-by-second basis, using a portable laboratory, which is comprised by a PM analyzer and a laptop. The ventilation rates were found in the literature and adapted according to the intensity of the physical effort during the measurements. PM 10 and PM 2. 5 concentrations were measured and compared across different microenvironments, such as walking, train, bus, mini-bus, tram and subway modes during off-peak hours based on a pre-selected round trip route in Lisbon, Portugal. Air quality data was also collected close to a fixed air quality monitoring station {{which is part of the}} round trip route, in order to have a reference PM concentration. A comparison of the different microenvironments based on the values obtained close to the fixed air quality station was made for PM concentrations and PM inhalation (which combines PM concentration with the physical effort). For this case study, results showed that the tram had higher PM 10 concentrations and <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> higher PM 2. 5 concentrations, whilst the train ride had the lowest for both parameters. When considering the inhalation, the results were similar. The tram microenvironment had the highest PM 10 inhalation while <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> train presented the highest PM 2. 5 inhalation. Even though the pedestrian microenvironment is the one with the highest ventilation rate, its low PM concentration leads to a low inhalation value, which proves the importance of considering both concentrations and ventilation...|$|E

Some passengers may feel hot, while the others may feel cold even in the same cabin due to the uneven temperature distribution in the cabin. For this reason, the temperature difference in the cabin should be as small as possible. In our present study, the effect of air mixing on the temperature <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> cabin during heating was studied by using a climatic chamber.

Almost seven million citizens a day are using sub-ways as a means of traffic communication in the Seoul metropolitan city in 2012. However, the subway system is a semi-closed environment, so many serious problems occurred in subway stations and injured passengers ’ health. Plat-form screen doors (PSD) are expected to prevent negligent accident such as injury or death from falling and improve the air quality of the subway station. Installation of PSD at stations in Seoul metropolitan subway had been completed in December 2009. Consequently, the underground transportation system became a closed environment, so the air quality has improved the platforms, but it has deteriorated in the tunnels. Especially, the subway cabin has many doors, and the doors are frequently opened and closed. For this reason, the effect of door opening on subway cabin, dust flow <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> cabin.

This study focused on the investigation of Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) and measurement target pollutants are PM 10, CO, CO 2, NO 2, O 3. It was found that levels of PM 10, CO 2, and NO 2 inside subway cabin line 2 exceeded the Korea IAQ stan-dard.

The thickness and the width of the air-curtain are 0. 08 m and 4 m respectively. The velocity of the air-curtain changes between 20 - 30 m/s. Three cases are analyzed depending on the installing location of the air-curtain. The discharged-air through the natural shafts increases as the velocity of the air-curtain increases when the air-curtain is installed between the mechanical and the natural shafts. The pollutant-air is exhausted by the mechanical and the natural shafts and remained air is pushed toward tunnel end. The discharged-air through the natural shaft is low when the air-curtain installed before the natural shaft. The mass flow rate decreases in the tunnel after the mechanical shaft as the air-curtain velocity increases. The computational results of the air-curtain installed tunnel become basis for the optimum design study. The air-curtain installing location is chosen between the mechanical and the natural shafts.

The majority of PM in the underground stations is generated within <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> system, due to abrasion and wear of rail tracks, wheels and braking pads caused during the motion of the trains. Substantial variation in average PM concentrations between underground stations was observed, which might be associated to different ventilation and air conditioning systems, characteristics/design of each station and variations in the train frequency. Average PM 2. 5 concentrations on the platforms in <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> operating hours ranged from 20 to 51 and from 41 to 91 μgm− 3 in the warmer and colder period, respectively, mainly related to the seasonal changes in <b>the</b> <b>subway</b> ventilation systems. <b>The</b> new <b>subway</b> lines with platform screen doors showed PM 2. 5 concentrations lower than those in the conventional system, which is probably attributable not only to the more advanced ventilation setup, but also to the lower train frequency and the design of the stations.
