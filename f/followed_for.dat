At the end of the year, she joined the Great White Fleet on its circumnavigation of the globe, which ended in early 1909. Peacetime training <b>followed</b> <b>for</b> the next five years, and in 1914 she cruised in Mexican waters to protect American interests during the Mexican Revolution. In early 1916, the ship was temporarily decommissioned.|$|E

5|$|Terang Boelan was a {{commercial}} success {{in both the}} Indies and abroad, earning 200,000 Straits dollars in British Malaya. This success revived the faltering domestic film industry and inspired films aimed at Malay audiences in Malaya, creating a formula of songs, beautiful scenery and romance that was <b>followed</b> <b>for</b> decades afterwards. The Indonesian film historian Misbach Yusa Biran {{described it as a}} turning point in the history of Indonesian cinema for its catalytic effect on the industry's growth. Like many Indonesian films of the era, Terang Boelan has been lost since at least the 1970s.|$|E
5|$|The {{construction}} of the East–West Telegraph line in the 1870s, along Eyre's route, resulted in a hazardous trail that could be <b>followed</b> <b>for</b> interstate travel. A national highway was called for, but the federal government {{did not see the}} route as important enough until 1941, when a war in the Pacific seemed imminent. The highway was constructed between July 1941 and June 1942, but was trafficable by January 1942. Though originally named Forrest Highway, after John Forrest, by the war cabinet, it was officially named and gazetted Eyre Highway, a name agreed upon by the states' nomenclature committees.|$|E

5|$|A 33-point season <b>followed</b> <b>for</b> Niedermayer in 1995–96, but the Devils {{became the}} first {{defending}} champion in 26 years to miss the playoffs. After a 35-point season in 1996–97, Niedermayer's best statistical season in New Jersey came in 1997–98 with a 14-goal, 57-point campaign. He played in his first NHL All-Star Game, scoring a goal, and {{was named to the}} NHL's Second All-Star Team at the season's end. After finishing second in league scoring amongst defencemen, despite playing in New Jersey's stifling defensive system that suppresses offence, Niedermayer demanded a significant raise. He rejected an offer that would have paid him a base salary of $3.25 million and, unable to come to terms {{before the start of the}} 1998–99 season, began the year as a holdout. As the dispute dragged into the season, he joined the Utah Grizzlies of the International Hockey League (IHL). After missing the first month of the NHL season, Niedermayer and the Devils finally agreed to a multi-year contract, the terms of which were not released. He appeared in 71 games with the Devils that season, recording 46 points.|$|E

In January 1943, however, the unit received orders to move to Gibraltar, where they were stationed as a precaution in case Germany decided to invade Spain. While there the commanding officer, John Durnford-Slater, carried out reconnaissance of potential targets in Spain from the air and sent officers on leave across the border to gather intelligence.|$|E
5|$|After the New Zealand Corps was disbanded, {{a period}} of rest and {{training}} in the Volturno Valley <b>followed</b> <b>for</b> the 20th Armoured Regiment before it returned to action in May. It was temporarily split from the 4th Brigade and its various squadrons detached in support of separate operations being conducted by 5th and 6th Brigades in advances to Avezzano. Following the Normandy landings, the Italian campaign {{was reduced to a}} sideshow, although one which still had considerable value in tying down German forces that could otherwise be used elsewhere. The regiment, now rejoined with 4th Brigade, supported the infantry brigades as they advanced to Florence, and entered the city in August. The 2nd New Zealand Division was transferred to the I Canadian Corps, then on the Adriatic Coast, and advanced up to Rimini. Here the B Squadron of the regiment supported an attack by a Greek mountain brigade towards Rimini on 14 September.|$|E

5|$|Albion's sole goalscoring {{opportunity}} {{of the second}} half came afterwards; Clark took the ball on a lengthy run before crossing it into the box, across an open goal with no Albion player there to tap the ball in and put the game beyond QPR's reach. Fifteen minutes {{from the end of the}} match QPR equalised, Marsh's shot with his right foot went in off the post. A corner <b>followed</b> <b>for</b> QPR who were now dominating Albion with their style of play. Allen crossed it in to Lazarus, but the Albion goalkeeper saved the shot with his legs. With eight minutes to go, one of Albion defenders mis-kicked the ball in their own penalty area. Hunt rushed in for the chance but Sheppard once again saved the game for Albion. The ball ran free to Mike Lazarus who tapped the ball into the back of an empty net to increase the scoreline to 3–2 in QPR's favour. A final attack from QPR came in the closing moments of the game as Lazarus took the ball past two defenders and into the box, his subsequent shot hit the outside of the post and went wide.|$|E
5|$|During the 30th {{session of}} the ESCAP/WMO Typhoon Committee in November 1997, a {{proposal}} was put forward by Hong Kong to give Asian typhoons local names and to stop using the European and American names {{that had been used}} since 1945. The committee's Training and Research Coordination Group was subsequently tasked to consult with members and work out the details of the scheme in order to present a list of names for approval at the 31st session. During August 1998, the group met and decided that each member of the committee would be invited to contribute ten names to the list and that five principles would be <b>followed</b> <b>for</b> the selection of names. It was also agreed that each name would have to be approved by each member and that a single objection would be enough to veto a name. A list of 140 names was subsequently drawn up and submitted to the Typhoon Committee's 32nd session, who after a lengthy discussion approved the list and decided to implement it on January 1, 2000. It was also decided that the Japan Meteorological Agency would name the systems rather than the Joint Typhoon Warning Center.|$|E
5|$|Every new Queen's Counsel created {{reduced the}} Serjeants in importance, since {{even the most}} junior QC took {{precedence}} over the most senior Serjeant. Although appointments were still made to the Serjeants-at-Law, the King's Serjeant and the King's Ancient Serjeant, and several Serjeants were granted patents of precedence which gave them superiority over QCs, the Victorian era saw a decline in appointments. The rule that all common law judges must be Serjeants was circumvented: anyone chosen to be a judge would be appointed a Serjeant, and immediately thereafter a judge. In 1834 Lord Brougham issued a mandate which opened up pleading in the Court of Common Pleas to every barrister, Serjeant or not, and this was <b>followed</b> <b>for</b> six years until the Serjeants successfully petitioned the Queen to overturn it as invalid.|$|E

5|$|For years {{leading up}} to the {{creation}} of the park, the leading citizens and newspapers in Albany had pushed for a grand public park. Frederick Law Olmsted's Olmsted, Vaux and Company was hired in 1869 to plan such a park. In their plan they envisioned Washington Park as the centerpiece of a string of parks and boulevards similar to those they had designed in Buffalo, Boston, and Brooklyn. Though Olmsted and his company was not involved in the actual design of the park, their broad vision was <b>followed</b> <b>for</b> the detailed designs, including the idea of damming the Beaver Kill (Beaver Creek) to form a grand lake.|$|E

Langer's staff created procedures that were <b>followed</b> <b>for</b> the next two decades. Smith stepped up efforts to obtain economic, psychological, and photographic intelligence.

With no money available for transfers {{he was forced to}} turn to the youth team for new players, though he could afford to take on Ian Nimmo, Hugh Dowd, John Dowie and Billy Russell on free transfers. He appointed former Leeds coach Les Cocker as his assistant. The season started poorly, but the squad bonded following Cocker's death on 4 October and went on a run of six straight wins, for which Bremner was credited with the Fourth Division Manager of the Month award. However a run of just one win in 15 games <b>followed,</b> <b>for</b> which Bremner blamed his small squad and lack of training facilities. A mounting injury crisis caused him to make a return to playing on 29 March for the visit of Bournemouth, a game in which 16-year-old Ian Snodin was named on the bench.
