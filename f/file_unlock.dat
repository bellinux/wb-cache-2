5000|$|As part of [...] "really shared files" [...] (stage three above), file locking was {{introduced}} to control simultaneous access to shared files between active MTS sessions (that is, between separate running tasks or processes). File locking does not limit or block access to files within a single MTS session (between command language subsystems or user programs running {{as part of the}} same MTS session).File locking in MTS is mandatory rather than advisory. Files are locked implicitly on first use of a particular type of access or explicitly using the $LOCK command or the LOCK subroutine. <b>Files</b> are <b>unlocked</b> implicitly when the last use of a file within a task is closed or explicitly using the $UNLOCK command or the UNLK subroutine. The $LOCKSTATUS command or LSFILE and LSTASK subroutines can be used to obtain a file’s or a task’s current lock status.|$|R

50|$|On August 4, 2011 Sega {{released}} Project DIVA Dreamy Theater 2nd to the Japanese PlayStation Network Store for PlayStation 3 users. The game {{is similar}} to the Dreamy Theater add-on for the first Project DIVA in that it contains the same content as the PSP version of Project DIVA 2nd but has much higher detailed graphics and is rendered on the PS3's GPU in 720p. Notable differences from the first Dreamy Theater game are that the player need only connect their PSP system once to transfer a save file rather than having it constantly connected via USB cable, as well as the addition of stereoscopic 3D for compatible TVs. Once the game has been unlocked by transferring a save <b>file,</b> all <b>unlocked</b> content from the player's PSP system will be available to play along with the songs from the first Project DIVA game as an added bonus.|$|R

40|$|Mary Tolbert had a long, {{distinguished}} career at OSU, as a student, {{as a teacher}} in the University School, and as a faculty member first in the School of Education, {{and later in the}} School of Music. Music was a central part of her life from early days, and she enrolled at Ohio Sate in 1931 in the newly established Music Department. Here she met Dr. Royal Hughes, the head of the Music Department, who assisted her in many ways. Others who aided her undergraduate studies were Joseph Leeder, Edith Jones, Cleoa Thomas, her voice teacher, Rachel Way Sherman, and Hilda Dierker, whose expertise in Latin American music inspired Tolbert to study other cultures. Overall the faculty was “superb. ” Following graduation she taught in several public schools. She returned to OSU when Professor Eugene Weigel appointed her in 1944 as the head of a new K- 12 music program at University School, a campus school administered by the OSU School of Education. Her position at University School also carried faculty rank at Ohio State. A major reason she left the public schools for OSU was the 1943 ruling of the Columbus Board of Education that single women teachers would lose their contracts if they married; OSU had no such rule. The University School was considered a separate department with its own administration and budget. The Director was responsible to the Dean of the College of Education. Many M. A. students brought their MA projects to work with the school faculty, although all classes were taught by faculty. There were four purposes defined in the functions of University School. 1) Demonstration School: Ways of formulating a school philosophy and putting it into action. 2) Laboratory School: Concerned with research and experimentation in education. 3) Experimental School: Try out intelligent hypotheses for improving education, study results critically, in light of evidence. 4) Service: Includes publications, programs, workshops, etc. Tolbert recalls that “teaching at University School was like joining a convent. There was no time for anything other than school work!” Over time this philosophy and focus changed. Some changes were made under the leadership of Dr. John Ramsayer. These included efforts to increase the diversity of the student body; especially from low income families; admitting students with physical or mental handicaps; and starting new experimental summer programs designed to ascertain the best methods for teaching limited children. Everyone on the faculty was encouraged to construct and develop new ideas and experiences. In 1952 Paul Klohr, who came from the Columbus Public Schools, was named Director. His innovations included a new study of core curriculum and a research study of talented students. Faculty were encouraged to do experimental studies with groups of children. For her study Tolbert equipped a music laboratory with low-skill instruments with moveable bars played with mallets, some rhythm and some string instruments. The goal was to find out what children learned by creating music using the structure of different music forms. Her students learned to use codas, bridges, basic harmonies, and notation. Some of the children appeared on the WLW-C Television Series, “Open Classroom,” and faculty from other schools often attended. More advanced students in the upper grades wrote and created musical dramas to present to their parents or for school assemblies. One 8 th grade class wrote an opera celebrating space exploration. High School students presented the musical “Desert Song” rather than a class play. It was presented on the concert stage at Hughes Hall, and was so successful other musicals followed every other year. These included “Red Mill,” “Brigadoon,” and “The King and I. ” In alternate years French and Spanish festivals were offered. Students were also offered individual electives to meet a special personal interest. The composition of a ten-year old composer was played by the Columbus Youth Orchestra. Occasionally Columbus teachers were employed temporarily, but some felt these outsiders were not teaching according to the innovative and progressive philosophy of University School –that of Boyd Bode [...] since they emphasized paper work and homework rather than problem solving and experimentation. Under the presidency of Novice Fawcett events came together which led to the demise of University School. The distinguished educator, James Conant, President of Harvard, launched his “Back to Basics Movement” which attacked Progressive schools and Liberal Education. After a controversial talk by a visiting professor, The Columbus Dispatch claimed that University School was “a nest of communists. ” President Johnson’s War on Poverty gave large grants to public schools, but none to campus schools. Despite major efforts made by a new Director, Alexander Frazier, to revamp the curriculum, to develop a cooperative program with some 90 school systems, and to create a new Center for School Experimentation, President Fawcett moved to shut down the school. His controversial mechanism was to appoint a committee, chaired by David Clark, stacked with opponents of University School. The Clark Report stated that the school should be closed. Supporters of the school were ignored or silenced. At a meeting of the College of Education faculty called to discuss the future of the School, no proponent of continuing the school was allowed to speak. Although the lower grades, K – 6, were continued for a time, the School finally shut down in 1968. Until Novice Fawcett all previous Presidents of OSU had supported the campus school. Tolbert believes that among other reasons Fawcett had for opposing the school {{was the fact that the}} College of Education refused to bend its rules so that he could earn his Ph. D. after becoming President. As mentioned various musical productions were staged at University School. Every effort was made to make the scenes as authentic as possible. For “The Red Mill” several citizens of Holland were contacted for information that would help in designing sets, and creating authentic costumes. For “Brigadoon” Scottish history, poetry, and folk lore were studied. Fifty years after staging “Brigadoon” there was a reunion of cast members who profusely thanked Mary Tolbert for her numerous contributions to the show. Some who came to this event had been contacted via a new University School website. Many former students still believed their school had been closed “without reason. ” Many graduates of the music program at the school had become professional musicians. Among the more successful were Sterling Smith, a professional harpsichordist; Dr. Wallace DePue, Head of the music program at Bowling Green University; Shirley Stoughton, who sang the title role in “Brigadoon,” gave vocal concerts on four continents in a long career; Dr. Karen Zumbrunn was a professional pianist; James Peyton, who sang and danced in “Brigadoon,” performed with the famous Jose Limon Dance Company; Donald Becker, who played in the orchestra of University School, operated his own Suzuki school in Boston; Dr. Kent Worth completed his Ph. D. at Yale University in Musicology, and taught musicology at the University of Connecticut; Joel Lazaar conducted symphony orchestras in Europe and the United States. In 1968 Mary Tolbert became a full-time member of the School of Music. She arranged for the transfer of various music materials from the former University School to the School of Music. She developed several new courses and workshops for both graduate and undergraduate students, and worked to introduce African music and dancing to the curriculum. A major program she helped develop was IMPACT (Interdisciplinary Model Program in Arts for Children and Teachers). The program was federally funded, and it led to two Columbus elementary schools, Eastgate and Cranbook, developing an experimental arts core curriculum. Components of the program included visual arts, children’s literature, dance, and music. This successful program showed teachers how arts relate to other subjects and new ways to teach children, and led to major beneficial changes. Unfortunately a later Superintendent of Schools in Columbus downgraded IMPACT to allow more time for a reading program. At about this same time the emerging concept of Middle School began widely to replace the earlier one of Junior High, Tolbert organized a conference to deal with necessary changes in music education within the school curriculum. Several former students who were now teaching in Middle Schools were invited back for this one-day conference to discuss the value of these new changes in public schools. An extensive tour of the Mediterranean in the summer of 1972 made it possible for Tolbert to collect substantial new materials, such as tapes, films, slides, and photos, for use in several different classes. In that same year Tolbert was heavily involved in a study which recommended changes in teacher certification. Evidently some of her colleagues, who opposed the changes recommended in this five-year study, obtained a preliminary copy of the report by removing it secretly from Tolbert’s personal files. She shared an office with four male colleagues, and her <b>files</b> were <b>unlocked.</b> Once obtained, the report was sent without her knowledge or permission to other Ohio schools. Other pertinent files also disappeared. The final version of the report was never circulated to OMEA (Ohio Music Education Association). One consequence of this controversy was the resignation of Dr. Marjorie Coakley, State Music Supervisor, with whom Tolbert had worked closely on this matter. Tolbert concluded “this entire episode shook my faith and trust in my colleagues in music education. ” She decided in 1968 to transfer from the College of Education to the School of Music. Unfortunately this was a less than happy solution. She had a small, cramped office which she shared with four men, a colleague eavesdropped on a|$|R
