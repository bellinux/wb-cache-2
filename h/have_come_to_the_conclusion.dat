5|$|Mary's biographers, such as Antonia Fraser, Alison Weir, and John Guy, <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> {{that either}} the {{documents}} were complete forgeries, or incriminating passages were inserted into genuine letters, or that the letters were written to Bothwell by some other person or by Mary to some other person. Guy {{points out that the}} letters are disjointed, and that the French language and grammar employed in the sonnets are too poor for a writer with Mary's education. However, certain phrases of the letters (including verses in the style of Ronsard) and certain characteristics of style would be compatible with known writings of Mary.|$|E
5|$|The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury {{says that}} the king also seized and {{depopulated}} many miles of land (36 parishes), turning it into the royal New Forest region to support his enthusiastic enjoyment of hunting. Modern historians <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that the New Forest depopulation was greatly exaggerated. Most of the lands of the New Forest are poor agricultural lands, and archaeological and geographic {{studies have shown that}} the New Forest was likely sparsely settled when it was turned into a royal forest. William was known for his love of hunting, and he introduced the forest law into areas of the country, regulating who could hunt and what could be hunted.|$|E
5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as {{to the nature of}} the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E

5|$|Whether an epikleros who {{was married}} {{at the time of}} her father's death was {{required}} to divorce her current spouse and marry the anchisteia is unclear. Most modern historians <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that this was only required if the epikleros had not yet had a son that could inherit the grandfather's estate. The clearest evidence is from the Roman playwright Terence, in his play Adelphoe, which includes a plot element involving a claim that a girl is actually an epikleros. Although the play was written in the 2nd century BCE, Terence adapted most of his plays from earlier Athenian comedies, which makes it slightly more reliable as a source. And common sense argues that if a son had already been born to an epikleros, there was no need to parcel out the epikleros to a relative in order to provide a male heir to the grandfather's estate. Although the anchisteia had the right to marry the epikleros, he was not required to do so, and could refuse the match or find another spouse for the heiress. It was also possible for the husband of an epikleros, who was not her anchisteia, to buy off the anchisteia in order to remain married to his wife. Such cases were alleged by the speaker of Isaeus' speech Isaeus 10 as well as a character in Menander's play Aspis.|$|E

25|$|Bruce Damer and David Deamer <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> {{that cell}} {{membranes}} cannot be formed in salty seawater, and must therefore have originated in freshwater. Before the continents formed, the only dry land on Earth would be volcanic islands, where rainwater would form ponds where lipids could form the first stages towards cell membranes. These predecessors of true cells {{are assumed to}} have behaved more like a superorganism rather than individual structures, where the porous membranes would house molecules which would leak out and enter other protocells. Only when true cells had evolved would they gradually adapt to saltier environments and enter the ocean.|$|E
25|$|When {{compared}} to other countries, Dutch drug consumption falls in the European average at six per cent regular use (twenty-one per cent {{at some point in}} life) and considerably lower than the Anglo-Saxon countries headed by the United States with an eight per cent recurring use (thirty-four at some point in life). Experts <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that the policies applied do not play a striking role in these statistics, though there is debate over this issue (CEDRO, 2004). While there has been talk for over a decade about preventing foreigners from entering Dutch cannabis coffeeshops by requiring customers to possess a 'weedpass', this legislation has not been enacted, so Dutch coffeeshops continue to sell cannabis openly to both locals and foreigners. However a small number of southern municipalities (including Roosendaal and Maastricht) in the Netherlands now require customers to carry identification proving that they are resident in the Netherlands.|$|E

Voorhis went on the attack, charging Nixon with misrepresenting the [...] "46votes" [...] to avoid real debate and any discussion of where Nixon himself stood on issues. The Republican candidate stated that he was fighting for [...] "the person on a pension {{trying to keep up}} with the rising cost of living... the white-collar worker who has not had a raise... Americans have had enough, and they <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that they are going to do something."

Goldman and Berkman felt a responsibility to support the strikers, stating: [...] "To remain silent now is impossible, even criminal." [...] The unrest spread to the port town of Kronstadt, where the government ordered a military response to suppress striking soldiers and sailors. In the Kronstadt rebellion, approximately 1,000 rebelling sailors and soldiers were killed and two thousand more were arrested; many were later executed. In the wake of these events, Goldman and Berkman decided there was no future in the country for them.

I added that I would rather lose a match in America than win one in England. But after having carefully considered the subject in all its bearings, I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that I neither mean to die yet nor to lose the match."

500|$|While most of {{the early}} reviewers of the Rights of Men, {{as well as most}} of Wollstonecraft's early biographers, criticized the work's emotionalism, and {{juxtaposed}} it with Burke's masterpiece of logic, there has been a recent re-evaluation of her text. Since the 1970s, critics who have looked more closely at both her work and Burke's, <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that they share many rhetorical similarities, and that the masculine/logic and feminine/emotion binaries are unsupportable. Most Wollstonecraft scholars now recognize it was this work that radicalized Wollstonecraft and directed her future writings, particularly A Vindication of the Rights of Woman. It is not until after the halfway point of Rights of Men that she begins the dissection of Burke's gendered aesthetic; as Claudia Johnson contends, [...] "it seems that in the act of writing the later portions of Rights of Men she discovered the subject that would preoccupy her {{for the rest of her}} career." ...|$|E
500|$|Following {{the fall}} of the town which Pope Pius II lamentably termed [...] "the gateway to Rascia", Stephen fled to Bosnia with his family and in-laws, seeking refuge at the court of his father. The King of Hungary accused Stephen and his family of selling Smederevo Fortress to the Ottomans [...] "for a great weight of gold", and the Pope at first {{believed}} him. Pius's own investigation appears to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that Stephen did not sell the fortress, as the Pope did not repeat the claim. Ottoman, Bosnian and Serbian sources say nothing about the supposed betrayal, so the allegation is unlikely to be based on fact. The Serbian-born janissary Konstantin Mihailović and the Byzantine Greek scholar Laonikos Chalkokondyles maintained Stephen's innocence and pointed out to the strength of the Ottoman army. Both state that the Serbs within Smederevo were so unhappy with Bosnian rule and convinced that the Ottomans would prevail (and grant them more religious tolerance than the Hungarians) that they went out to meet Mehmed and presented him with keys to the city.|$|E

500|$|Although the {{investigation}} {{did not find}} any considerable evidence linking Kocharyan to the Hunanyan group, many Armenian politicians and analysts believe that President Robert Kocharyan and National Security Minister Serzh Sargsyan were behind the assassination of Vazgen Sargsyan and other leading politicians. Albert Bazeyan stated in 2002 that [...] "We <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that the crime was aimed at making Robert Kocharian's power unlimited and uncontrolled. By physically eliminating Karen Demirchyan and Vazgen Sargsyan, its organizers wanted to create prerequisites for Kocharyan's victory in the future presidential elections." [...] Ter-Petrosyan accused Kocharyan and Serzh Sargsyan and their [...] "criminal-oligarchic" [...] system of being the real perpetrators of the parliament shooting. Nairi Hunanyan, the leader of the armed group, {{was a member of the}} Armenian Revolutionary Federation (ARF, Dashnaktsutyun). According to the ARF, Hunanyan was expelled from the party in 1992 for misconduct and had not been in any association with the ARF since then. Some speculations have been made about the involvement of the ARF in the shootings. In 2000, Ashot Manucharyan stated he was worried that [...] "a number of Dashnaktsutyun party leaders are acting in the interest of the American foreign policy." ...|$|E
500|$|Field Marshal Frederick Roberts, in his 1897 book Forty-one Years in India, gave an {{opposing}} view; Roberts {{stated that he}} doubted [...] "whether anything would have been gained" [...] by an attempt to pursue the mutineers as the cavalry available (the 6th Dragoon Guards) {{was at that time}} composed mainly of recruits with horses that had not yet been broken and it was impractical to follow the mutineers with either infantry or artillery. Roberts went on to say [...] "after careful consideration of all the circumstances of the revolt at Meerut, I <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> {{that it would have been}} futile to have sent the small body of mounted troops available in pursuit of the mutineers on the night of the 10th May, and that, considering the state of feeling throughout the Native army, no action, however prompt, on the part of the Meerut authorities could have arrested the Mutiny. The sepoys had determined to throw off their allegiance to the British Government, and the when and the how were merely questions of time and opportunity." [...] The actions of the 3rd Bengal Light Cavalry themselves were described by Major Agha Amin, writing for Defence Journal, as [...] "a coup d'état and an outstanding example of initiative and courage." ...|$|E
500|$|Some bowlers had {{experimented with}} Bodyline in the season, and the West Indian team, 1–0 {{down in the}} series and {{frustrated}} {{by the lack of}} pace in the pitches, decided to experiment with the tactic. Facing a good West Indies total, England suffered a batting collapse, at one point falling to 134 for four. With Les Ames in difficulty against the short-pitched bowling, Jardine said, [...] "You get yourself down this end, Les. I'll take care of this bloody nonsense." [...] He went right back to the bouncers, standing on tiptoe, and stopped them with a dead bat, sometimes playing the ball one handed for more control. Wisden described how he never flinched despite facing the greatest amount of Bodyline. It also believed that he played it [...] "probably better than any other man in the world was capable of doing." [...] He batted for nearly five hours, scoring 127, his only Test century. England then retaliated by bowling Bodyline in the West Indies' second innings, but the slow pitch meant that the match was drawn. However, this performance played a large part in turning English opinion against Bodyline. The Times used the word [...] "Bodyline", without using inverted commas or using the qualification [...] "so-called", for the first time. Wisden said that [...] "most of those watching {{it for the first time}} must <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>conclusion</b> that, while strictly within the law, it was not nice." ...|$|E
