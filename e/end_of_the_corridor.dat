5|$|The {{video is}} {{centered}} on Maroon 5 playing in a dimly-lit house/factory. Throughout {{the course of the}} video, items such as darts on a dart board, candles, pictures, and even members of the band with their instruments are shown fading in and out. Towards the end of the video, Adam Levine is seen walking through a narrow corridor dragging a guitar with pictures {{on both sides of the}} wall fading in and out. When he reaches the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor,</b> he is face to face with a wall with a small light coming out of it and then flings his guitar backwards and then pounds on the wall. The camera then quickly moves to a scene of the band playing and the lights suddenly flickering on.|$|E
25|$|The five {{characters}} go {{onto the}} surface, where {{they find it}} desolate. Zaphod suggests that the Magratheans lived {{beneath the surface of}} the planet. They split into two groups – Trillian, Zaphod and Ford explore a tunnel, whilst Arthur and Marvin remain on the surface. Trillian, Zaphod and Ford's thread ends on a cliff-hanger, with them seeing something alarming at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{elevator}} rises for a {{few seconds}} before coming to its first stop. The doors open to reveal a long, dimly lit hotel corridor, with overgrown plants and doors to guest rooms, with morning newspapers and room-service trays outside, along its length. There is a single window at the opposite <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> A violent thunderstorm is raging and lightning flashes outside the window. The five missing passengers from 1939 appear for several moments, turning to face the elevator and beckoning the guests to join them. Then they disappear in a burst of electricity. The corridor fades away, but the window remains until it appears to be floating in a dark field of stars. The window morphs into the window from the Season 5 opening sequence, and breaks.|$|E

25|$|There {{are very}} few archaeological sources {{contemporaneous}} with Neferefre, a fact which is now seen by Egyptologists, including Miroslav Verner, to witness a very short reign. In particular, as of 2017, only one inscription dated to his rule is known. It was left by the builders of his pyramid on a corner block at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> leading down to the pyramid substructures. The inscription was written {{on the fourth day}} of the Akhet season in the year of first occurrence of the cattle count, an event consisting of counting the livestock throughout the country to evaluate the amount of taxes to be levied. It is traditionally believed that such counts occurred every two years during the Old Kingdom although recent reappraisals have led Egyptologists to posit a less regular and somewhat more frequent count. Therefore, the inscription is likely to refer to Neferefre's first or second year on the throne, and his third year at the very latest. Finally, a few artefacts dated to Neferefre's rule or shortly after have been uncovered in his mortuary complex and elsewhere in Abusir, such a clay seals bearing his Horus name.|$|E
25|$|The East Corridor and Grand {{staircase}} Dating {{from the}} 1730s, connects the North Hall via the south-east {{door with the}} Ante-Library, this is a relatively plain room, the stone staircase at the east <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> is cantilevered from the walls and has a wrought iron balustrade, the ceiling above the staircase is painted with Fame and Victory, by Francesco Sleter, the same artist's wall paintings on the staircase no longer survive. The walls of the corridor are now lined with paintings of former headmasters {{of the school and}} in the east window above the staircase there is white marble bust a copy of the head of the Apollo Belvedere. There used to be forty-five paintings on the walls, including: Godfrey Kneller's portrait of John, Duke of Marlborough now in the Institute of Directors; Henry Fuseli's paintings of characters from A Midsummer Night's Dream, Titania and Bottom now in Tate Britain and his Oberon wakes Titania now in the Kunstmuseum Winterthur; and attributed to John Closterman, General Michael Richards and his Brother, General John Richards, at the siege of Belgrade now in the Slovak National Gallery. Also originally in the corridor but sold in 1848 were eleven Greek vases, three from the Lucien Bonaparte's excavations at Canino, also a Roman sarcophagus dating from Trajan's reign.|$|E
25|$|On 22 November, the Bologna Division repulsed {{an attack}} from Tobruk towards Sidi Rezegh and next day, Rommel sent the Afrika Korps towards the Egyptian border (the Dash to the Wire) {{to exploit the}} victory and destroy XXX Corps. The blow mostly fell on empty desert and gave the Eighth Army time to regroup and re-arm. The Afrika Korps was ordered back to Tobruk, where the 70th Infantry Division and the New Zealand Division had gained the initiative. At noon on 27 November, the 15th Panzer Division reached Bir el Chleta and met the 22nd Armoured Brigade (reduced to a {{composite}} regiment of fewer than fifty tanks), which was joined later by the 4th Armoured Brigade. As night fell the British tanks disengaged and the New Zealand Division, fighting at the south-east <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> into Tobruk, was endangered by the Afrika Korps. On 4 December, Rommel attacked Ed Duda and was repulsed by the 14th Infantry Brigade of the 70th Infantry Division. Rommel ordered a retirement from the eastern perimeter of Tobruk, to concentrate against XXX Corps to the south. On 7 December, the 4th Armoured Brigade engaged 15th Panzer Division and knocked out eleven tanks. Rommel was told on 5 December, by Comando Supremo that supply could not improve {{until the end of}} the month, when airborne deliveries from Sicily began. Rommel decided to abandon Tobruk and withdraw to Gazala, which led to the relief of Tobruk and the occupation of Cyrenaica.|$|E

50|$|The Bottineau Transitway Alternative Analysis Study, {{released}} in 2009, outlined several different alternatives {{for both the}} northern and southern <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor.</b> In 2010, <b>the</b> final AA report recommended the A-D1 light rail alignment as the best option, but also suggested B-D1, A-D2 and B-D2 should continue to be studied. A-D1 and B-D1 were also recommended for continued study as possible bus rapid transit alignments.|$|R
500|$|Within Adventure, the Easter egg {{is located}} inside the black castle catacombs (on {{difficulty}} level 2 or 3), {{embedded in the}} south wall of a sealed chamber (accessible only with the bridge), where there is an invisible 1-pixel object {{referred to as the}} Gray Dot. The player must bounce the avatar along the bottom wall to pick up the dot. The dot is not actually invisible, but is simply the same color as the wall and is easily seen when placed in a catacombs passage or over a normal wall. The dot is not attracted to the magnet, unlike most other objects in Adventure. Bringing this dot to the east <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor</b> below the Yellow Castle while other differently colored objects are present causes the wall object to similarly become effectively invisible, allowing the player to pass into a room displaying the words [...] "Created by Warren Robinett".|$|E
2500|$|The {{convention}} center {{also received a}} complete renovation. A [...] long corridor was created {{on the east side}} of the facility to connect the Great Hall with the meeting rooms. At the center of the corridor were the escalators and stairs which connected with the reception pavilion above. At the south <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor,</b> a new carpeted pre-function space was created to support the meeting rooms. The corridor was decorated with horizontal bands of stone in beige, grey, and soft rose; reddish light sconces; and wood grills that mimic the X-like pattern found on the exterior of other buildings on the Cleveland Mall. The corridor floor was now terrazzo, and contained repetitive images of the CCVB logo.|$|E

[...] The interiors of the first floor retail shops are open rectangular spaces without decoration as they were originally designed.|$|E
50|$|Automatic crowd-control gates {{known as}} portillons automatiques were once present in <b>the</b> {{majority}} <b>of</b> stations at <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridors</b> leading to <b>the</b> platforms. Introduced from the 1920s to regulate passenger access to crowded platforms, their usefulness was never properly demonstrated {{and from the}} 1960s they were withdrawn from service. Most have been dismantled, but non-functioning examples can still be found at Charles de Gaulle - Étoile and Gare d'Austerlitz.|$|R

2500|$|Former inmate Leon [...] "Whitey" [...] Thompson, {{who worked}} as a guide at Alcatraz for many years and later visited it {{regularly}} before his death in 2005, believed that Alcatraz Island is haunted and has stated that [...] "he could feel it" [...] while he was incarcerated there. [...] He later believed the prison to be [...] "damned", and often had the sense of being watched by spirits. During his time in the prison, Thompson was friendly with an inmate named Johnny Haus, a big Texan. He last saw him on 25 October 1962 when he left Alcatraz and knew he'd never see Haus again. One day in the 1980s when Thompson was alone in the cellhouse waiting for visitors to arrive for a tour, he claimed to have seen a large dark figure {{at the end of the}} [...] "Michigan Avenue" [...] corridor. [...] He saw the apparition walk around the corner and out of sight. Thompson rushed to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>corridor,</b> but nobody was there. He believed the ghost to be that of Haus, by the way he walked and the feeling which the figure gave off. [...] Afterwards, Thompson said [...] "I don't care what anybody says, that was Johnny Haus".|$|E
