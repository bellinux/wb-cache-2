Considering CAPEX and fuel alone, {{the total cost of}} the plant is 6.4 + 5 + 4 = $15.4billion. Dividing the total cost by the energy produced over the same period gives a rough estimate of the cost of electricity for a 20-year lifetime operation: $15.4billion / 160billion kWh = 9.6 cents/kWh.

The criterion analysed {{here is the}} maximisation of aggregate <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> from the contractor´s perspective, known as an RCPSP problem with <b>Discounted</b> <b>Cash</b> <b>Flows</b> (RCPSPDCF). The <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> analysed here cover the contractor´s cash outflows (negative <b>cash</b> <b>flows),</b> related to the commencement of individual activities, and cash inflows (positive <b>cash</b> <b>flows)</b> after the fulfilment of individual milestones. The authors propose a two-phase algorithm for solving the problem defined. In the first phase, the simulated annealing metaheuristics is used, designed to identify a forward schedule with as high total DCF as possible. In the second phase, the best first-phase schedule is improved by right shifts of activities. To this end, the procedure which iteratively shifts tasks by one unit is applied, {{with a view to}} maximising the objective function. Activity shifts take into consideration precedence and resource constraints, and they are performed for a specified resource allocation to activities. This paper also includes an analysis of the problem for a sample project. The results of computational experiments are then analysed. The experiments were run with the use of standard test problems from the Project Scheduling Problem LIBrary (PSPLIB), with additionally defined <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> and contractual milestones.

2500|$|Certain {{business}} situations, and {{the parent}} firms in those cases, are also logically analysed under an options framework; see [...] "Applications" [...] under the Real options valuation references. Just {{as a financial}} option gives its owner the right, but not the obligation, {{to buy or sell}} a security at a given price, companies that make strategic investments have the right, but not the obligation, to exploit opportunities in the future. Thus, for companies facing uncertainty of this type, the stock price may (should) be seen as the sum of the value of existing businesses (i.e., the <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> value) plus any real option value.

2500|$|However, {{the concept}} of value (as well as [...] "book value") has evolved {{significantly}} since the 1970s. Book value is most useful in industries where most assets are tangible. Intangible assets such as patents, brands, or goodwill are difficult to quantify, and may not survive the break-up of a company. When an industry is going through fast technological advancements, {{the value of its}} assets is not easily estimated. Sometimes, the production power of an asset can be significantly reduced due to competitive disruptive innovation and therefore its value can suffer permanent impairment. One good example of decreasing asset value is a personal computer. An example of where book value does not mean much is the service and retail sectors. One modern model of calculating value is the <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> model (DCF), where the value of an asset is the sum of its future cash flows, discounted back to the present.|$|E

Employing contingent claims analysis in tangible investments several assumptions made by <b>discount</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> method are concerned and better assessment results can be derived. In this work, an attempt is made to apply real options methodology in agricultural investments. Many agricultural investors face a growing uncertainty environment with high sunk investments and net present value criterion has been extensively used that may be lead to incorrect decisions. Both <b>discount</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> method and real options approach are employed {{to evaluate the effectiveness}} of a new technology project under uncertainty returns in agriculture. <b>Discount</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flow</b> approach indicates that the adoption of a new technology project under uncertainty is feasible while real options approach differentiates the results.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was to value Pandora A/S, which is a publicly traded firm on the NASDAQ OMX Copenhagen Stock Exchange in Denmark. Pandora has been increasing its importance in the luxury goods market, more directly in the jewellery segment, due to its remarkable growth and crescent brand awareness. Pandora’s enterprise value was estimated using three different methodologies: <b>discounted</b> <b>cash</b> <b>flows</b> approach, multiples valuation and adjusted present value methodology. The target prices obtained were: 785, 76 DKK/share according to the <b>Discounted</b> <b>Cash</b> <b>Flows</b> methodology, 690, 77 DKK/share according to Multiples valuation and 779, 71 DKK/share if the Adjusted Present Value is used. Since {{it is believed that}} the <b>Discounted</b> <b>Cash</b> <b>Flows</b> approach is the most accurate of them, the final estimated target price is 785, 76 DKK/share. This result leads to the conclusion that Pandora is undervalued in the stock market, since its actual trading price at May 29 2015 is of 683 DKK/share, representing a potential gain to investors approximately of 103 DKK/share. At last, a comparison between the target price obtained and one estimated by J. P. Morgan was performed. J. P.

At the same time, this method is often applied to valuation of high growth technology companies.
