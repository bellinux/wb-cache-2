25|$|Assaliaq (assaliq; lit. «fried thing»; also, pancake; other fried food; fry bread) {{is fresh}} fried fish. All {{parts of the}} fish except the {{entrails}} are used to prepare this dish, although often the heads are removed as well. The fish is <b>filleted,</b> dipped in seasoned flour, or just seasoned with salt, and fried in oil. If households enjoy picking and sucking backbones or only a few fish are available, the backbone will be fried along with the <b>filleted</b> pieces. Heads are sometimes fried for the same reasons. Boiled rice is the favorite side dish with this meal. Middle aged and younger people enjoy this meal for the flavor. The verb assali- (to fry; to make pancakes or griddlecakes) is derived from Russian жа́рить (zhárit’) ‘to roast, fry, broil, grill’.|$|E
25|$|Fresh fish is {{a highly}} {{perishable}} food product, {{so it must be}} eaten promptly or discarded; it can be kept for only a short time. In many countries, fresh fish are <b>filleted</b> and displayed for sale on a bed of crushed ice or refrigerated. Fresh fish is most commonly found near bodies of water, but the advent of refrigerated train and truck transportation has made fresh fish more widely available inland.|$|E
25|$|Long term {{preservation}} of fish is accomplished {{in a variety}} of ways. The oldest and still most widely used techniques are drying and salting. Desiccation (complete drying) is commonly used to preserve fish such as cod. Partial drying and salting is popular for the {{preservation of}} fish like herring and mackerel. Fish such as salmon, tuna, and herring are cooked and canned. Most fish are <b>filleted</b> prior to canning, but some small fish (e.g. sardines) are only decapitated and gutted prior to canning.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{trawlers}} {{store the}} fish they catch {{in some form}} of chilled condition. At the least, the fish will be stored in boxes covered with ice or stored with ice in the fish hold. In general, the fish are kept fresh by chilling them with ice or refrigerated sea water, or freezing them in blocks. Also, many trawlers carry out some measure of onboard fish processing, and the larger the vessel, {{the more likely it is}} to include fish processing facilities. For example, the catch can undergo some preliminary processing by being passed through sorting and washing devices. At a further stage, the fish might be mechanically gutted and <b>filleted.</b> Factory trawlers may process fish oil and fish meal and may include canning plants.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fillet</b> {{weight is}} an {{economically}} important trait in Nile tilapia production for the European market which asks for fish with average body weights {{of at least}} 700 g. Genetic parameters to design or optimize breeding programs for these body weights are lacking. In an earlier study we showed that high phenotypic correlations exist between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight and low phenotypic correlations exist between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> yield. To evaluate the potential of mass selection for <b>fillet</b> traits, however, genetic parameters are required. The aim {{of the current study}} was to estimate genetic parameters for body weight, <b>fillet</b> weight, <b>fillet</b> yield and body measurements. Therefore, slaughter data was collected on 1884 pedigreed Nile tilapias. Measurements of body weight, length, width, corrected (=fillet) length and head length were taken on each fish. <b>Filleting</b> machines were used to <b>fillet</b> fish and measurements of <b>fillet</b> weight, <b>fillet</b> yield and head weight were collected. Subsequently, genetic parameters were estimated. Heritabilities were 0. 26 for body weight, 0. 24 for <b>fillet</b> weight and 0. 12 for <b>fillet</b> yield. The genetic correlation between body weight and <b>fillet</b> weight was 0. 99 and between body weight and <b>fillet</b> yield 0. 74. The genetic correlation between <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield was 0. 81. Genetic correlations between <b>fillet</b> weight and body measurements were 0. 89 for length, 0. 70 for head length, 0. 94 for width and 0. 91 for corrected length. Genetic correlations between <b>fillet</b> yield and body measurements were 0. 62 for length, 0. 47 for head length, 0. 98 for width and 0. 60 for corrected length. The potential of mass selection aiming to improve <b>fillet</b> weight was evaluated by a number of selection indexes. The accuracy of a selection index including only body weight indicated that in this way almost the same amount of the selection response could be achieved compared to what hypothetical direct selection for <b>fillet</b> weight would. The use of only width in the selection index would result in 8. 5 % lower selection response than the use of body weight. We conclude that body weight is the best predictor for <b>fillet</b> weight compared to body measurement...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fillet</b> yield (i. e. the {{proportion}} of edible flesh from a given amount of fish) is a trait of high economic interest for species sold as <b>fillets.</b> Improving it by selective breeding {{is not an easy}} task, as it is a ratio trait, which causes mathematical difficulties. It is moreover a specific ratio where numerator (<b>fillet</b> weight) and denominator (body weight) are very strongly correlated (genetic and phenotypic correlations in the range 0. 89 – 0. 99). This led some authors to conclude that they have the same genetic and phenotypic basis, precluding selection for improved <b>fillet</b> yield. In this study, we propose to study <b>fillet</b> yield as a component of two traits, <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight (waste weight = body weight- <b>fillet</b> weight, so the sum of head, bones, fins and viscera weight), which we expect to be less correlated. Using data from 5 batches of fish from 3 species (sea bass, sea bream, rainbow trout), we show that as expected, <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight are less correlated than <b>fillet</b> weight and body weight (on average, r A = 0. 91 and r P = 0. 88 vs. r A = 0. 987, r P = 0. 981). We used stochastic simulation to generate genotypes and phenotypes of fish using those genetic parameters for <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight. We simulated 10 generations of selection for increased <b>fillet</b> yield using nine selection indices. Five indices had rather similar performances, residual <b>fillet</b> weight (the residual of the regression of <b>fillet</b> weight to body weight), <b>fillet</b> yield, <b>fillet</b> to waste ratio, restricted selection index (a linear index aimed at improving <b>fillet</b> weight while keeping waste weight constant) and linear index (optimized to improve fillet/waste ratio). With these indices, the average selection gain was + 0. 66 % of <b>fillet</b> yield per generation (range 0. 30 to 0. 95 % using real genetic parameters from 5 fish batches). Selection for the difference between <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight was 30 % less efficient, while selection for increased <b>fillet</b> weight or increased body weight was 55 – 65 % less efficient. Selection against waste weight had a null or even negative impact on <b>fillet</b> yield. Factors favorable to higher selection gains are low initial <b>fillet</b> yield, different heritabilities and CVs of <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight, low genetic correlation and high phenotypic correlation of <b>fillet</b> weight and waste weight. These results suggest that although <b>fillet</b> weight and body weight are strongly correlated and proportional to each other, moderate selection gains on <b>fillet</b> yield are possible. We consider {{it would be useful to}} add waste weight in the parameters recorded in future genetic studies on <b>fillet</b> yield...|$|R
500|$|Over-hunting {{by humans}} {{has been one}} of the most widely {{accepted}} hypotheses for the ultimate demise of the subfossil lemurs. The extinctions and human hunting pressure are associated due to the synchronicity of human arrival and species decline, as well as the suspected naïveté of the Malagasy wildlife during the early encounters with human hunters. [...] Despite the assumptions, evidence of butchery has been minimal until recently, although folk memories of rituals associated with the killing of megafauna have been reported. [...] Archeological evidence for butchery of giant subfossil lemurs, including Palaeopropithecus ingens and Pachylemur insignis, was found on specimens from two sites in southwestern Madagascar, Taolambiby and Tsirave.

40|$|In Nile tilapia, {{breeding}} programs focus {{mainly on}} growth, {{and information on}} genetic improvement of <b>fillet</b> yield is scarce. In this study, slaughter data were collected on 1215 tilapia and {{used to analyze the}} relationship between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield. Fish were obtained from three different origins/strains, and raised in a commercial farm in the Netherlands in closed recirculation systems until a final mean weight of 700 g. Body weight, length, height, width and corrected (= <b>fillet)</b> length were taken prior to slaughter, and used to predict <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield using linear regression models. Average <b>fillet</b> yield was 35. 7 % with large differences between strains (range 34. 4 - 38 %). There was a strong almost linear relationship between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight, but relationships with <b>fillet</b> yield were weak. R- 2 of the regression model for <b>fillet</b> weight was 0. 95 and the correlation between observed and predicted values of <b>fillet</b> weight 0. 98. The effect of strain/origin was significant for each body measurement. The effect of sex and strain x sex was significant for length and corrected (= <b>fillet)</b> length. The <b>fillet</b> yield model explained 15 % of the observed variance; the correlation between observed and predicted <b>fillet</b> yield was 0. 38, but there were large differences within strains. We conclude that in Nile tilapia, predicting <b>fillet</b> yield based on body measurements is possible, but correlations can be improved if more accurate methods for measuring body width become available.

40|$|A three {{generation}} {{data set}} consisting of 5, 532 records {{from a long}} term selection program for high growth rate in GIFT was used to derive prediction equations for <b>fillet</b> weight and <b>fillet</b> yield. Models were based on body traits (body weight, standard length, body width and body depth) and a carcass measurement (<b>fillet</b> weight). Length, width and depth were adjusted for the systematic effects of generation, selection line, gender, <b>filleting</b> batch, grow-out pond, their first order interactions, and for the covariables age at slaughter and body weight. Body and <b>fillet</b> weights adjusted for the same effects (except body weight) were used to calculate <b>fillet</b> yield. Average <b>fillet</b> weight and yield were 177. 7 g and 33. 6 %, respectively. The simple (Pearson) correlation coefficients between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight were moderate to very high (0. 52 to 0. 94), but the correlations between body traits and <b>fillet</b> yield were very low (- 0. 02 to 0. 14). There were strong linear relationships between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> weight, whereas relationships of body traits with <b>fillet</b> yield were weak. Step-wise multiple regression analysis showed that the best model to predict <b>fillet</b> weight included all body traits, with a coefficient of determination (R 2) of 0. 94 and a correlation between observed and predicted values of <b>fillet</b> weight of 0. 97. The corresponding figures for <b>fillet</b> yield were 0. 12 and 0. 35, respectively. Body weight was {{the best predictor of}} <b>fillet</b> weight, explaining 93 % of observed variance when it was fitted alone in the model. By contrast, body depth explained a large proportion (97 %) of total variance in the full prediction model for <b>fillet</b> yield. It is concluded that in practical breeding programs, improvement of <b>fillet</b> weight can be easily made through indirect selection for body trait combinations. By contrast, improvement of <b>fillet</b> yield seems much more difficult to achieve by indirect means, with only 12 % of the variation in the trait explained by the body and carcass traits examined in this stud...|$|R
30|$|In conclusion, {{total weight}} {{is the best}} single {{measurement}} for predicting <b>fillet</b> weight in Asian sea bass. Regression models developed {{in this study are}} applicable to fish weighing 960 – 1190  g from all populations sampled. Using separate models yielded similar prediction power and accuracy for <b>fillet</b> weight. This study demonstrates the use of various body measurements in predicting <b>fillet</b> yields. Despite relatively weak correlations between body measurements and <b>fillet</b> yields, we were able to develop useful prediction models for <b>fillet</b> yields in three stocks of Asian sea bass. Although <b>fillet</b> yield is the most important trait for fish processors, increased <b>fillet</b> percentages could be achieved along with increased <b>fillet</b> weights, given the positive correlation between the traits. The application of prediction models would allow for rapid genetic improvement via breeding to increase <b>fillet</b> yields and enable producers to be more competitive in the value-added markets of Asian sea bass.|$|R
