5|$|Commercially, apples can {{be stored}} for some months in {{controlled}} atmosphere chambers to delay ethylene-induced ripening. Apples are commonly stored in chambers with higher concentrations {{of carbon dioxide and}} high air filtration. This prevents ethylene concentrations from rising to higher amounts and preventing ripening from occurring too quickly. Ripening continues when the <b>fruit</b> <b>is</b> removed from storage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fruit</b> <b>is</b> {{normally}} {{picked by}} a perched bird, {{although there is}} a record of a mulberry fruit being taken in flight. Garden warblers often feed with conspecifics and other fruit-eating passerines. Over 35 plant species have been recorded as food for this warbler just in central Europe, with many additional species being consumed in the Mediterranean region and on the African wintering grounds.|$|E
50|$|The <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> egg-shaped {{and about}} 4-10 centimeters long. Their color varies from yellow and orange to red and almost purple. Sometimes they have dark, {{longitudinal}} stripes. Red <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> more acetous, yellow and orange <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> sweeter. The flesh has a firm texture and contains more and larger seeds than a common tomato. The <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> {{very high in}} vitamins and iron and low in calories (only about 40 calories per fruit).|$|R
30|$|All {{the ripe}} <b>fruits</b> <b>were</b> harvested, weighed and graded as {{marketable}} and non-marketable. <b>Fruits</b> <b>were</b> classified as non-marketable when fruits showed sign of decay due to diseases or insect feeding {{or any other}} malformation on the fruit surface (Zaller 2007). Relative proportions of non-marketable <b>fruits</b> <b>were</b> expressed as percentages {{of the total number}} of fruits harvested. Marketable fruits do not show any sign of decay.

5|$|A decade-long {{study of}} urine and faecal samples at the Gunung Palung Orangutan Conservation Project in West Kalimantan {{has shown that}} orangutans give birth {{during and after the}} high fruit season (though not every year), during which they consume various {{abundant}} fruits, totalling up to 11,000 calories per day. In the low-fruit season, they eat whatever <b>fruit</b> <b>is</b> available in addition to tree bark and leaves, with daily intake at only 2,000 calories. Together with a long lactation period, orangutans also have a long birth interval.|$|E
5|$|By 2007, Songpol Somsri, a Thai {{government}} scientist, had crossbred {{more than}} ninety varieties of durian to create Chantaburi No.1, a cultivar without the characteristic odour. Another hybrid, Chantaburi No. 3, develops the odour {{about three days}} after the <b>fruit</b> <b>is</b> picked, which enables an odourless transport yet satisfies consumers who prefer the pungent odour. On 22 May 2012, two other cultivars from Thailand that also lack the usual odour, Long Laplae and Lin Laplae, were presented to the public by Yothin Samutkhiri, governor of Uttaradit Province from where these cultivars were developed locally, while he announced the dates for the yearly durian fair of Laplae District, and the name giver to both cultivars.|$|E
50|$|Ripened Phulwara <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> {{collected}} by hand or by beating the plant with long bamboo sticks. The harvested <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> dried in shade for eight to twelve days. Seeds can <b>be</b> separated from <b>fruits</b> either manually or mechanically. If {{the quantity of}} <b>fruits</b> <b>is</b> relatively small, the <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> crushed manually and the seeds separated. For larger quantities, a roller machine is used for seed extraction. The machine sequences the fruit through trays, collecting fresh fruit {{at one end and}} the seeds at the lower end.|$|R
50|$|The <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> 85 mm in length, with a {{width of}} 34 mm. The <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> {{straight}} with a rounded transverse section and a bottle-necked apex. <b>Fruits</b> <b>are</b> light green and turn a light yellow when ripe. The skin is very thin and easily cracks when overripe, {{they also tend}} to snap off the stems by themselves when ripe.|$|R
50|$|The {{components}} of other aggregate <b>fruit</b> <b>are</b> {{more difficult to}} define. For example, sugar apple (Annona spp.) <b>fruit</b> <b>are</b> made up of individual berry-like pistils fused with the receptacle.|$|R
5|$|Cubebin (C20H20O6) is a {{crystalline}} substance {{existing in}} cubebs, discovered by Eugène Soubeiran and Capitaine in 1839. It may be prepared from cubebene, {{or from the}} pulp left after the distillation of the oil. The drug, along with gum, fatty oils, and malates of magnesium and calcium, contains also about 1% of cubebic acid, and about 6% of a resin. The dose of the <b>fruit</b> <b>is</b> 30 to 60 grains, and the British Pharmacopoeia contains a tincture with a dose of 4 to 1 dram.|$|E
5|$|<b>Fruit</b> <b>is</b> rich {{in sugar}} but {{deficient}} in other nutrients, {{so it must}} be eaten in large quantities. Bohemian waxwings have a large liver which helps to convert sugar to energy. They can metabolise ethanol produced from the fermentation of those sugary fruits more efficiently than humans, but may still become intoxicated, sometimes fatally. Waxwings often drink water or eat snow in winter, since the sugar in their fruit diet tends to dehydrate the birds through an osmotic effect. In the summer, the fruits are juicier and water is less of a problem.|$|E
5|$|Maraba's coffee {{plants are}} the Bourbon {{variety of the}} Coffea arabica species and are grown on fertile {{volcanic}} soils on high-altitude hills. The <b>fruit</b> <b>is</b> handpicked, mostly {{during the rainy season}} between March and May, and brought to a washing station in Maraba, where the coffee beans are extracted and dried. At several stages, the beans are sorted according to quality. The farmers receive credits based on the amount and quality of the beans they provide.|$|E

40|$|<b>Fruits</b> <b>are</b> {{important}} {{horticultural products}} for human sustenance. Tropical region produces high variety of <b>fruits</b> species. <b>Fruits</b> <b>are</b> naturally produced for local consumption and processed products. Most of tropical <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> cultivated in developing countries. Due to lacks {{of knowledge of}} fruits growers, limited fruit harvesting and handling facilities, long distance between production fields and fruit markets/destination, and <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> perishable in mature, these horticultural products are prompted to physical damages. This becomes constraint in promoting purpose. This paper describes physical damages of several tropical fruits hopping that the presented information is useful for growers, government and fruits traders...|$|R
5|$|On {{a garden}} scale, the berries should be picked when dry and ripe. Commercially, most {{harvesting}} is done mechanically by straddle harvesters. These move continually down the rows, straddling {{a row of}} bushes, shaking the branches and stripping off the fruit. The blackcurrants are placed into half tonne bins and to minimise stoppage time, some machines have cross conveyors which direct the fruit into continuously moving trailers in the adjoining row. A modern machine can pick up to fifty tonnes of blackcurrants in a day using only one operator and two tractor drivers. The bins should be stored in a cool place. Some <b>fruit</b> <b>is</b> still picked by hand {{for use in the}} fresh fruit market.|$|E
5|$|Ranging {{behavior}} can also exhibit seasonal variability. During the hot, wet season, females range widely, either {{alone or in}} groups of up to six individuals. In the cool, dry season, smaller core groups stabilize in order to occupy concentrated areas. Therefore, during seasons when <b>fruit</b> <b>is</b> abundant, subgroups are larger while scarcity is met with more solitary behavior. This suggests that although their feeding ecology is inflexible, being tied to widely distributed, patchy, and sometimes scarce fruit, ruffed lemurs instead adapt the social system in order to survive.|$|E
5|$|The German birds {{wintering}} in British gardens rely on provided food, and {{the major}} items are bread and fat, each making up around 20% of the diet; one bird survived the whole winter eating only Christmas cake. <b>Fruit</b> <b>is</b> also eaten, notably cotoneaster (41% of the fruit consumed), ivy and honeysuckle, and apple if available. Some birds have learned to take peanuts from feeders. Blackcaps defend good winter food sources in the wild, and at garden feeding stations they repel competitors as large as starlings and blackbirds. Birds occasionally become tame enough to feed from the hand.|$|E
50|$|The foliage is used {{as green}} manure for paddy cultivation. Immature <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> very bitter to taste, it is {{consumed}} just like bitter guard. It helps to heal bowel complains and joint pains. Unripe <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> slightly crushed in order {{to remove the seeds}} and then dried. Dried <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> used in cooking. It is of more economic importance. Several ton dried <b>fruits</b> <b>are</b> coming to the market every year. Local inhabitants able to get some revenue out of it. Solanum torvum is also used for the same purpose, but it is not bitter to taste.|$|R
