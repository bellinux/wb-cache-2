5|$|The Ethiopian {{highland}} hare (Lepus starcki) is {{a medium-sized}} species of mammal in the rabbit and hare family, Leporidae. Its dorsal pelage is grizzled, buff white and spotted and streaked with black, while <b>its</b> <b>belly</b> fur is pure white and fluffy. It is endemic to the Ethiopian Highlands, ranging over the Afroalpine {{regions of the}} Shoa, Bale, and Arsi Provinces of Ethiopia. A herbivore, it mostly feeds on moorland grasses. The IUCN rates it as a species of least concern.|$|E
5|$|The {{depiction}} of Diplodocus posture has changed considerably over the years. For instance, a classic 1910 reconstruction by Oliver P. Hay depicts two Diplodocus with splayed lizard-like limbs {{on the banks}} of a river. Hay argued that Diplodocus had a sprawling, lizard-like gait with widely splayed legs, and was supported by Gustav Tornier. This hypothesis was contested by William Jacob Holland, who demonstrated that a sprawling Diplodocus would have needed a trench through which to pull <b>its</b> <b>belly.</b> Finds of sauropod footprints in the 1930s eventually put Hay's theory to rest.|$|E

5|$|In 1849, a {{few years}} before his death in 1852, Mantell {{realised}} that iguanodonts were not heavy, pachyderm-like animals, as Owen was putting forward, but had slender forelimbs; however, his passing left him unable to participate {{in the creation of the}} Crystal Palace dinosaur sculptures, and so Owen's vision of the dinosaurs became that seen by the public for decades. With Benjamin Waterhouse Hawkins, he had nearly two dozen lifesize sculptures of various prehistoric animals built out of concrete sculpted over a steel and brick framework; two iguanodonts (based on the Mantellodon specimen), one standing and one resting on <b>its</b> <b>belly,</b> were included. Before the sculpture of the standing iguanodont was completed, he held a banquet for twenty inside it.|$|E
5|$|Male orangutans play {{almost no}} role in raising the young. Females {{do most of the}} caring and socializing of the young. A female often has an older {{offspring}} with her to help in socializing the infant. Infant orangutans are completely dependent on their mothers for {{the first two years of}} their lives. The mother will carry the infant during travelling, as well as feed it and sleep with it in the same night nest. For the first four months, the infant is carried on <b>its</b> <b>belly</b> and never relieves physical contact. In the following months, the time an infant spends with its mother decreases.|$|E
5|$|Male tigers are {{generally}} more intolerant of other males within their territories than females are of other females. Territory disputes are usually solved by displays of intimidation rather than outright aggression. Several such incidents have been observed in which the subordinate tiger yielded defeat by rolling onto its back and showing <b>its</b> <b>belly</b> in a submissive posture. Once dominance has been established, a male may tolerate a subordinate within his range, {{as long as they}} do not live in too close quarters. The most aggressive disputes tend to occur between two males when a female is in oestrus, and may rarely result in the death of one of the males.|$|E

5|$|Ninox boobook fusca {{is found}} on Timor, Roma, Leti and Semau Islands {{in the eastern}} Lesser Sunda Islands. It was {{described}} by Veillot in 1817 as Strix fusca. It has a more grey-brown plumage with no red tinge, unlike other subspecies. it has grey streaks on <b>its</b> <b>belly</b> and white spots on its secondaries, inner wing-coverts and nape. Genetic and call analysis show it to be markedly divergent to the Australian populations of the southern boobook, leading Gwee and colleagues to suggest it be reclassified as a separate species. Its calls are shorter and more frequent than subspecies boobook.|$|E
5|$|The black {{wildebeest}} has a {{dark brown}} or black coat which is slightly paler {{in summer and}} coarser and shaggier in the winter. Calves are born with shaggy, fawn-coloured fur. Males are darker than females. They have bushy and dark-tipped manes that, as in the blue wildebeest, stick up {{from the back of}} the neck. The hairs which compose this are white or cream-coloured with dark tips. On its muzzle and under its jaw it has black bristly hair. It also has long, dark-coloured hair between its forelegs and under <b>its</b> <b>belly.</b> Other physical features include a thick neck, a plain back, and rather small and beady eyes.|$|E
5|$|Following the accident, Johnson {{suggested}} {{launching the}} D-21 {{from the very}} large Boeing B-52 Stratofortress bomber, and adding a solid rocket booster to get it up to speed. The drone was modified by adding attachment points on its spine to mate with the carrying pylon on the B-52 and <b>its</b> <b>belly</b> attachment points were adapted to accommodate the rocket booster necessary to increase its speed and allow its ramjet to operate. Its vertical stabilizer was increased in size by approximately 20%. The modified drone version was designated D-21B (there was no D-21A). Two B-52Hs were modified to carry a pair of drones each by means of two large underwing pylons that replaced the smaller pylons used for the AGM-28 Hound Dog cruise missiles. The tail gunner's and electronic warfare officer's stations were replaced with two launch control stations. Command and telemetry systems were added, and high-speed cameras were installed to track the drones as they separated from the pylons. The launch control officer on the B-52H could communicate with the D-21Bs, and could make it self-destruct.|$|E

50|$|According to an {{ecologist}} of the Israel Nature and Parks Authority, the frog's Hebrew name, agulashon shehor-gahon (Black-bellied round-tongued), {{derives from}} <b>its</b> black <b>belly</b> and round tongue. The scientific {{name of the}} species reflects these details as well. Unlike the tongues of other frogs, it is not used to catch prey.|$|R
5|$|In {{response}} to the Spartan counter-attack against the Epiriotes filling the trench, Pyrrhus decided to personally lead a charge against the Spartan lines. Mounted on his horse, the Epiriote King was able to force his away through the trench, over the wagons and into the city {{with a group of}} his companions. The sudden onslaught of Pyrrhus sparked panic amongst the defenders of this section. At this point Pyrrhus' horse was wounded by a javelin which pierced <b>its</b> <b>belly</b> causing it to throw the King to the ground. The fall of the King threw his companions into a state of confusion and enabled the Spartans to rally. The Spartans launched a barrage of missiles at the King's comrades, felling many of them. Despite the deaths of many of his guards, Pyrrhus was successfully taken to the safety of the main Epiriote lines.|$|E
5|$|On 23 April 1917, Ball {{was under}} strict orders to stay over British lines, but still engaged the Germans {{five times in}} his Nieuport. In his first combat that day, using his {{preferred}} belly shot, he sent an Albatros into a spin, following it down and continuing to fire at it until it struck the ground. It was No.56 Squadron's first victory. Regaining an altitude of , he tried to dive underneath an Albatros two-seater and pop up under <b>its</b> <b>belly</b> as usual, but he overshot, and the German rear gunner put a burst of 15 bullets through the Nieuport's wings and spars. Ball coaxed the Nieuport home for repairs, returning to battle in an S.E.5. In his third combat of the day, he fired five rounds before his machine gun jammed. After landing to clear the gun, he took off once more, surprising five Albatros fighters and sending one down in flames. His fifth battle, shortly thereafter, appeared inconclusive, as the enemy plane managed to land safely. However, its observer had been mortally wounded.|$|E
5|$|The first F-111C, A8-126 {{selected}} for conversion to the RF-111C variant was modified at General Dynamics plant at Fort Worth, Texas between October 1978 and 18 April 1979. After {{four months of}} test flights, the aircraft returned to Australia in August 1979 where it conducted further tropical weather trials at Darwin. The other three aircraft were modified by the RAAF's No. 3 Aircraft Depot at RAAF Base Amberley in 1980, using kits purchased from General Dynamics. The RF-111C variant proved to be highly successful, and {{was considered to be}} among the best tactical reconnaissance aircraft in the world. Three of the four RF-111Cs remained in RAAF service until 2010. The other aircraft was retired in 2006 after suffering damage from landing on <b>its</b> <b>belly</b> after one of its main wheels separated during take off; although the aircraft was repairable it was judged not worthwhile doing so due to the impending retirement of the entire F-111 fleet. The RAAF does not have an aircraft with the RF-111C's intelligence, surveillance and reconnaissance capabilities since they were retired.|$|E

Breeding males develop smooth skin and a flattened tail.|$|R
5|$|In December 1999, the Russian {{government}} outlined that it {{planned to}} purchase 164 aircraft by 2018. The Ukrainian government in October 2000 {{estimated that the}} country had a requirement for 65 aircraft. By then, the Russian government had awarded the Polyot plant, which was based in Omsk, the right to produce the aircraft, ahead of Aviakor and Aviastar of Samara and Ulyanovsk, respectively. The Kiev Aircraft Production Plant was expected to produce the first aircraft in 2003, and Polyot, in 2004. As the An-70 flight test programme had reached its final stages {{by the end of}} 2000, it was expected that the Russian and Ukraine Defence Ministries would approve of mass production at the start of 2001. On 27 January 2001, however, the second An-70 prototype made a crash landing on <b>its</b> <b>belly</b> after losing power in two engines on take-off during cold weather testing in Omsk, and was severely damaged. Four of the 33 people onboard were injured. It looked as though the A400M was now going to have the market all to itself. Antonov recovered the crashed aircraft and repaired it, but the project still lacked funding.|$|E
25|$|After {{the crew}} {{abandoned}} the aircraft, it continued flying southward. The mostly intact wreckage and evidence showing one engine was still operating {{at the time}} of impact suggests the aircraft gradually lost altitude in a very shallow descent, reached the flat, open desert floor and landed on <b>its</b> <b>belly.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the collision, {{the captain}} of Flight 575 {{determined}} that his DC-9 could not remain airborne, and attempted to land back on the runway. When he did, the plane's two remaining landing gear collapsed rearward, and the DC-9 skidded on <b>its</b> <b>belly</b> off Runway 27L, across a grassy area, and onto Runway 32L, where it came to rest. It immediately burst into flames.|$|E

The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and Luxair ordered a replacement Q400 to be delivered in August 2016.|$|E
25|$|The {{first officer}} landed the {{aircraft}} at {{what appeared to}} be the runway threshold. It then came in contact with the earth bank which ripped off all three undercarriage legs and the aircraft slid to a halt on <b>its</b> <b>belly.</b> The fire alarm for the port engine sounded, and the crew performed fire drills on both engines. One female passenger injured her leg. The wrecked aircraft was initially stored but was later declared as damaged beyond economic repair and was subsequently scrapped.|$|E
50|$|The Malabar pied {{hornbill}} {{is a large}} hornbill, at 65 cm in length. It has mainly black plumage, {{apart from}} <b>its</b> white <b>belly,</b> throat patch, tail sides and trailing edge to the wings. The bill is yellow with a large, mainly black casque. Females have white orbital skin, which the males lack. Juveniles have no casque. It might {{be confused with the}} oriental pied hornbill.|$|R
5000|$|Bitis heraldica is a venomous viper species {{found only}} in Angola, easily {{distinguished}} from B. caudalis by <b>its</b> heavily speckled <b>belly</b> and lack of any supraocular [...] "horns". No subspecies are currently recognized.|$|R
