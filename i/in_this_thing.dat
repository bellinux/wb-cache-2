The vastly ambitious Estrella project would remain deserted and was sold in 1993 to an investment group.|$|E
500|$|On November 9, 2007, Jay-Z {{appeared}} on the Charlie Rose Show to discuss the album. When asked about how the film gave life to this album, he stated [...] "It's a New York City true story, you know. So {{as soon as the}} movie came on, it was like familiar, things that my pop seen and my uncles seen and, you know, different things like that, things I've seen growing up. So they resonated with me in a way, the story, as well as, I mean, even though everything happens, you know, the way it turns out, you know, it's one of those movies that where you champion the bad guy, because the bad guy, you know, he don't seem like a bad guy, and the good guy — I mean the good guys are bad. You know, that complex — the complexity of human beings <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> was amazing to me. I loved the complexity of the human beings".|$|E

2500|$|Penrose is an atheist. In {{the film}} A Brief History of Time, he said, [...] "I think I {{would say that}} the {{universe}} has a purpose, it's not somehow just there by chance ... some people, I think, take the view that the universe is just there and it runs along – it's a bit like it just sort of computes, and we happen somehow by accident to find ourselves <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing.</b> But I don't think that's a very fruitful or helpful {{way of looking at the}} universe, I think that there is something much deeper about it." [...] Penrose is a Distinguished Supporter of the British Humanist Association.|$|E

6000|$|Against work itself, I say nothing. But I {{sometimes}} {{wonder if}} I stand alone <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing.</b> Am I {{the only person}} left who hates it? ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{benefit of}} storyboarding {{is that the}} {{production}} can plan the movie <b>in</b> advance. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> step, <b>things</b> like type of camera shot, angle, and blocking of characters are decided.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Very well.' He relinquished his coaxing tone, {{and went}} on sternly: 'And {{remember}} this, Cytherea, I am as innocent of deception <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> as you are yourself. Do you believe me?' ...|$|E
6000|$|All this Sammy Jay guessed, {{and after}} a while he grew tired of {{following}} Lightfoot for nothing. [...] "I'll have to take a hand <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> myself," [...] muttered Sammy. [...] "At this rate, Lightfoot never will find that big stranger!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I made a mistake, Kemp, a huge mistake, <b>in</b> {{carrying}} <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> through alone. I have wasted strength, time, opportunities. Alone--it {{is wonderful}} how little {{a man can}} do alone! To rob a little, to hurt a little, {{and there is the}} end.|$|R
6000|$|... "It {{will never}} blow over for me," [...] he replied, passionately, [...] "and {{you must not}} include me <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing.</b> I've lived {{a long way from}} it thus far, and I don't intend to mix up with this kind of hokus-pokus." ...|$|E

6000|$|His lordship's eye fell {{before the}} other's cold glance, {{and again he}} lapsed into thoughtfulness, his cheek now upon his hand. Suddenly he looked up again.

60|$|Mr. Caryll {{smiled and}} nodded.

6000|$|... "I'll swear I'll do my best, Jim; I'll work double tides," [...] said I. [...] "It is {{my fault}} {{that you are}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> and I'll get you out again, or kill myself. But what is that you say? 'If we go ahead?' Have we any choice, then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was relentlessly cruel." [...] Weston's voice grew sharper. [...] "Still, I {{tried to}} make it. I gave way in only one point--I came to see you now and then. Now it's so hard that I'm beaten. I've failed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing</b> as I've failed in the other." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Ah, clod! ah, earthly mass!" [...] cried Aylmer, {{laughing}} {{in a sort}} of frenzy, [...] "you have served me well! Matter and spirit--earth and heaven--have both done their part <b>in</b> <b>this!</b> Laugh, <b>thing</b> of the senses! You have earned the right to laugh." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, a Pinkerton. But, sure, you wouldn't {{know what}} that is, acushla, nor what it may mean {{to the likes of}} me. I'm too deep <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>thing,</b> and I may {{have to get out of}} it quick. You said you would come with me if I went." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} be turned aside," [...] said he.

6000|$|... "I {{believe it}} was," [...] replied George; [...] "but, {{at the same}} time, it is well to be sure.
