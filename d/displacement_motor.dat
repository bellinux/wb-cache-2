"December 2012 "Pumps and motors are commonly connected hydraulically to create hydrostatic drives, also known as hydrostatic transmissions. A typical hydrostatic transmission consists of a variable displacement pump and a fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>motor.</b> Maximum efficiency is typically created for the system when the motor operates at maximum volumetric displacement. The objective of this research is to determine if a hydrostatic transmission with a variable <b>displacement</b> <b>motor</b> can be more efficient than one with a fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>motor.</b> A work cycle for a Caterpillar 320 D excavator was created and the efficiency of the hydrostatic drive system, controlling the swing circuit, with a fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>motor</b> was compared to the efficiency with a variable <b>displacement</b> <b>motor.</b> A PID and an H∞ controller were designed for a position control model, as well as velocity control. It was found that while it may seem obvious to achieve maximum efficiency at maximum displacement, there are some cases where maximum efficiency is achieved at a lower displacement. It was also found that for the given work cycle, a hydrostatic transmission with a variable <b>displacement</b> <b>motor</b> can be more efficient...|$|E

However, service life of positive <b>displacement</b> <b>motor</b> becomes shorter resulting from failure of the driving shaft thread. The three-dimensional simulation model of driving shaft’s connecting thread has been developed based on the principle of virtual work, Von Mises yield criterion, and contact nonlinear theory. This article has put forward the plan to optimize structure of driving shaft with straight thread based on the design principle of double-shouldered thread; besides, fatigue life of driving shaft with straight thread before and after optimization has been assessed by resorting to the multiaxial fatigue principle and Brown–Miller critical plane rule. In line with research results, mechanical properties of driving shaft with straight thread are superior to those of driving shaft with taper thread. Under the load of axial drill pressure with fluctuation and alternating torque, fatigue life of driving shaft with straight thread after optimization is greatly improved. This article has not only provided basis for optimizing connecting thread of driving shaft but also boasts of high engineering value for improving service life of positive <b>displacement</b> <b>motor...</b>|$|E

40|$|A novel {{pressure-controlled}} hydro-mechanical transmission (PHMT) is {{studied in}} this paper. The PHMT {{consists of a}} pressure-controlled hydraulic transmission (PCT) and a variable displacement hydraulic motor. The PCT functions like a conventional hydrostatic transmission (HST) but has a different form. It uses a double-acting vane pump with a floating ring. By coupling the floating ring to an output shaft, the vane pump becomes a hydraulic transmission. The PCT combines the pumping and motoring functions in one unit, making it much simpler than a conventional HST. By controlling the pressure in the PCT, the output shaft torque and speed can be adjusted. By feeding the PCT control flow to a variable <b>displacement</b> <b>motor</b> coupled to the PCT output shaft, a PHMT is constituted. In this paper, the fundamental principle of the PHMT is studied.

High cost, long drilling cycles, and low rate of penetration (ROP) represent critical challenges for offshore drilling operations. The hydraulic pulse generator was specifically designed, based on China offshore drilling technologies and parameters, to overcome problems encountered during offshore drilling. Both laboratory and field tests were conducted to collect {{the characteristics of the}} hydraulic pulse generator. The relationships between flow rate and pressure amplitude, pressure loss and pulse frequency were obtained, which can be used to optimize operation parameters for hydraulic pulse jet drilling. Meanwhile a bottom hole assembly (BHA) for pulse jet drilling has been designed, combining the hydraulic pulse generator with the conventional BHA, positive <b>displacement</b> <b>motor,</b> and rotary steerable system (RSS) etc. Furthermore, the hydraulic pulse jet technique has been successfully applied in more than 10 offshore wells in China.

40|$|Background: The {{study is}} about to {{examine the effect of}} the {{selective}} physical exercises on the development of displacement skills in High Function Autistic (HFA) children. Materials and Methods: In this research, 10 children (7. 9 ± 1. 4 years) among of 33 children with HFA in Sahr-e-Kord city (in Iran) based on their pre-test scores randomly were selected. The measuring tool was Test of Gross Motor Development- 2000 (TGMD- 2). Selected motor program (SPARK motor program) in this research includes motor strengthening activities, games and sports for children that were performed for 12 sessions by our subjects. Normal distribution of data checked by K-S test and appropriate statistical Levine's and ANOVA tests (dependent and independent types) were used for compare mean values (α= 0. 05). Results: Twelfth sessions of selected physical exercises training in experiment group made significant differences in some research variables but it was not the case for the control group. There were significant differences in running (p= 0. 002), trotting (p= 0. 08), jumping (p= 0. 002) and gliding (p= 0. 004) and there were non-significant differences in hop (p= 0. 035) and leaping (p= 0. 02).

"December 2012 "Increasing petroleum prices have developed a strong demand for an invention to reduce fuel consumption, as well as cut the produced amount of carbon dioxide via consumed fuel. Hybrid vehicles are an effective invention in terms of the hybrid research area because they can accomplish a low fuel consumption rate, thus dropping the carbon dioxide volume that is produced correspondingly. The main goal of this research is to design and model a hydraulic hybrid transmission that has a controlled pressure displacement pump and a controlled <b>displacement</b> <b>motor.</b> The design will show reasonable safety factor numbers in the worst conditions of operation. In addition, modeling was done for the entire drive train including 16 equations that signify the mechanical path and the hydraulic path, which represent the Hydraulic Hybrid Transmission (HHT). HHT consists of a manual gear box that is mounted in series with a split torque device. The output from the power split device delivers power to the two power paths then combines again via a downstream spur gear. A Proportional-Integral control was designed to make the engine work near a wide open throttle line (WOT), which is the most efficient way for an engine to produce power...|$|E
40|$|In this research, {{two types}} of {{hydrostatic}} transmission systems (HTS) were analyzed comprehensively, namely valve-controlled and displacement-controlled systems. The valve-controlled HTS utilized a pump driven by the wind turbine rotor, a proportional flow control valve, and two hydraulic motors. A 5 th order nonlinear model of the system was developed, simulated using MATLAB/SIMULINK platform, and then validated on a test-bench. The validation {{results showed that the}} model accurately predicted the system performance. Then, the validated model was used to evaluate the performance of such a system with desired operation of a wind power plant. It was found that the valve-controlled system was not suitable for this application due to consistent power loss and operational conflicts between the HTS and desired outcome of a wind power plant. ^ Next, displacement-control configurations were analyzed. One configuration comprised of a variable displacement pump with fixed <b>displacement</b> <b>motor</b> (variable-pump/ fixed-motor) and another configuration comprised of a fixed displacement pump with a variable <b>displacement</b> <b>motor</b> (xed-pump/variable-motor). Considering wind turbine speed/power characteristics and the hydraulic circuitry, it was assessed that the variable-pump/fixed-motor configuration yielded lower eciency at low wind speeds and required a larger pump unnecessarily. The fixed-pump/variable motor HTS showed potentials for wind power harvesting; therefore it was selected for further analysis in this research. The power and speed characteristics of the rotor as the prime mover of the pump and the need for efficient operation of the pump and the xiv motor required a unique system design that is very different than that of conventional hydrostatic systems. A component sizing methodology was proposed to improve annual energy production of a HTS. It was shown that with optimal operation planning, a wind turbine with hydrostatic transmission system (HTSWT) can generate equal or more energy than that of a geared WT. ^ To further improve the modeling accuracy, a nonlinear multivariable model of the fixed-pump/variable motor HTS was developed. Two main control objectives were defined for the system, namely: maximum power point tracking (MPPT) of the instantaneous wind and stabilizing the generator speed tightly as mandated by the stringent grid connectivity codes. To design a robust control configuration in order to achieve these objectives, a relative gain array (RGA) analysis was performed. The RGA suggested a novel input-output pairing for the system. Considering results of the RGA analysis, a decentralized multivariable control system was designed. For wind MPPT, an innovative control law was derived independent of direct wind speed measurement. For generator speed control, a feedback linearization technique was implemented to maintain the generator speed precisely at the grid frequency. Operation of a community scale hypothetical HTSWT (600 kW) with the designed control system was simulated with MATLAB/SIMULINK software. It was shown the at any wind speeds and under very large wind perturbations, the maximum power is harvested from wind using the proposed decentralized control system. Additionally, the generator was driven with zero steady state error and less than 0. 15 Hz frequency deviation during wind transients. Robustness of the control system was examined under wide range of plant uncertainties. Even for a turbine with unknown rotor specifications, the designed control law was able to track near-maximum wind power. ^ To ensure that the maximum power is delivered by a HTSWT, a constrained optimal control formulation was investigated. A real-time optimal feedback control adapted from Pontryagin minimum principle was designed for the HTSWT system in order to maximize energy output for any given operating condition. The optimal control law minimized the overall loss at any operating points. Finally, a conceptual xv HTS design featuring variable-pump/variable-motor was studied. It was shown that the additional control input, pump displacement, enables the HTSWT to eliminate the trade-off between aerodynamic efficiency and transmission eciency at low wind speeds. Consequently, the output power from a variable-pump/variable-motor HTS is shown to exceed that from a fixed-pump/variable motor HTS. This output power improvement was significant at low wind speeds. ...|$|E
40|$|Moving heavy parts at {{high speeds}} with precise {{positioning}} is a production goal of many companies. Several researchers dealt with this challenge and proposed different studies. Achieving this task requires a system which is powerful enough to accelerate or deccelerate the heavy load quickly. Also, it requires high accuracy control tools. These tools should have fast response and good stability under changeable working conditions. In this work a servovalve-controlled-hydraulic motor driven positioning system is modeled and its sensitivity to different operation conditions changes was studied. ^ The positioning system consisted of a square rail bearing linear table (Parker 41803 ST) with an accuracy of 0. 001 inches and maximum travel span of 36. 5 inches. The power screw was driven by a high speed hydraulic motor (Parker M 4 - 015) which provided the system with up to 6 inches per second linear speed for the 36. 5 inch span. The motor speed was controlled by a BD 15 Parker servovalve. The position of the moving table is monitored using an absolute encoder to feedback position information to the control system. A LASER distance sensor (LDS 80 / 10 of Dynavision) was used to detect the workpiece with a +/− 0. 001 inches accuracy. The analog output of this sensor was fed into the control system to correct the table position until it reached the desired operating point. The EASY 5 was used to build a dynamic model of the system. The hydraulic system was modeled and simulated using EASY 5 which had predefined hydraulic components models {{in addition to the}} ability of defining new ones. EASY 5 model made it possible to study the dynamic behavior of the system under varied conditions of the entrained air, servovalve frequency, motor displacement, conductor length, motor leakage, mass and temperature changes. ^ A servovalve-controlled hydraulic motor-driven positioning system was built and a dynamic model of the system was built using EASY 5. ^ Eigenvalues sensitivity analysis showed that fluid line between the hydraulic motor and the servovalve is the most influential factor on system stability. ^ As a matter of total time to reach the final point, performance was at: (1) 0. 2 % entrained air compared with 0. 5 % and 1 %. (2) Servovalve frequency, time delay for 1 Hz was increased to 1. 38 sec. compared with 1. 28 sec. for 50 Hz. (3) Using 0. 1 in 3 <b>displacement</b> <b>motor</b> reduced total time although it increased time delay compared with the 0. 15 in 3 and 0. 3 in 3 displacement motors.
