5|$|Hummus is {{a staple}} in Palestinian side dishes, in {{particular}} in hummus bi tahini, in which boiled, ground beans are mixed with tahini (sesame paste) and sometimes lemon juice. Hummus is often slathered <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and sometimes sprinkled with paprika, oregano and pine nuts; the latter are especially popular in the West Bank. Chick peas are also mixed with ful (fava beans), resulting {{in an entirely different}} dish, mukhluta, with a distinct flavor and brownish color.|$|E

40|$|Virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> is {{the juice}} from the olive drupe, a produce that usually {{features}} high quality. However, virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> produced <b>in</b> {{different regions of}} the world suffer from defects, most of them of sensory nature. The largest amount of <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> <b>in</b> which some organoleptic defect is present matches to the Virgin <b>Olive</b> <b>Oil</b> (VOO) class. The causes leading to sensory defects <b>in</b> virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> on the different steps of the elaboration, are not well-known sometimes. Important is to note that current legislation allow the classification with sensory defects as VOO and Lampante <b>Olive</b> <b>Oil</b> (LOO). Volatile compounds are important in the sensory perception of the <b>olive</b> <b>oils,</b> for both the positive attributes and the defects. Knowledge on the biogenesis of the volatile compounds involved <b>in</b> the virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> defects and <b>in</b> its sensory characterisation is still scarce. There are different causes of defects, depending on the physical, chemical or microbial degradation affecting the product. These join to the positive attributes, leading to an infinite diversity of sensory `fingerprints¿. The microbes cause the most of the defects sensory analysed <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> Despite some interesting studies reported on the biogenesis of the compounds responsible of such defects, microbiological research within the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> production, includingpost-harvest life of olives, is scarce. We should highlight there is a long way to avoid the generation of sensory defects <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> within the production process itself and storage. This paper tries to identify significant shortfalls on the knowledge of the causes and circumstances for inducting sensory defects <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils,</b> and defining the major aspects which are sufficiently known.

5|$|The cooking of {{the area}} {{is not to be}} {{confused}} with the Mediterranean diet, made popular because of the apparent health benefits of a diet rich <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> wheat and other grains, fruits, vegetables, and a certain amount of seafood, but low in meat and dairy products. Mediterranean cuisine encompasses the ways that these and other ingredients, including meat, are dealt with in the kitchen, whether they are health-giving or not.|$|E
5|$|Israeli {{salad is}} {{typically}} made with finely chopped tomatoes and cucumbers dressed <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> lemon juice, salt and pepper. Variations include {{the addition of}} diced red or green bell peppers, grated carrot, finely shredded cabbage or lettuce, sliced radish, fennel, spring onions and chives, chopped parsley, or other herbs and spices such as mint, za'atar and sumac. Although popularized by the kibbutzim, versions of this mixed salad were brought to Israel from various places. For example, Jews from India prepare it with finely chopped ginger and green chili peppers, North African Jews may add preserved lemon peel and cayenne pepper, and Bukharan Jews chop the vegetables extremely finely and use vinegar, without oil, in the dressing.|$|E

5|$|Frying food <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> is attested in Classical Greece {{from about}} the 5th century BCE. The late Roman {{cookbook}} of Apicius (c. 400), appears {{to list the}} ancient Romans' first use of deep frying to prepare Pullum Frontonianum, a chicken dish. The practice of deep frying spread {{to other parts of}} Europe and Arabia in the following centuries. Deep-fried foods such as funnel cakes arrived in northern Europe by the 13th century, and deep-fried fish recipes have been found in cookbooks in Spain and Portugal at around the same time. Falafel arrived in the Middle East from population migrations from Egypt as soon as the 14th century. The deep frying of food in Japan was likely introduced by Portuguese the 16th century. Evidence of potato frying can be found as early as the late 17th century in Europe.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to those in Italian Food, there are many Italian recipes and descriptions {{of the land and}} the people in David's other works. The first recipe in her first book, Mediterranean Food—soupe au Pistou—is of Genoese origin. Also in that book are recipes for bocconcini, osso bucco, and several Italian pasta and chicken dishes. Among the recipes in Summer Cooking is peperonata (pimentos or sweet peppers cooked with tomatoes <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> and butter) which was reprinted as the title article in a later selection from David's works. In An Omelette and a Glass of Wine, David printed Italian recipes including soups and omelettes made with hops (zuppa di lupolli and frittata con i loertis). Also in that book are substantial essays on Italian people and places. Is There a Nutmeg in the House? includes a six-page article on vegetable dishes from Mantua, and another of similar length on the variations of pizza in Italy and beyond.|$|E
5|$|Turkish cuisine is {{regarded}} as one of the most prominent in the world, its popularity is largely owed to the cultural influences of the Ottoman Empire and partly because of its major tourism industry. It is largely the heritage of Ottoman cuisine, which can be described as a fusion and refinement of Central Asian, Caucasian, Middle Eastern, Mediterranean and Balkan cuisines. The country's position between the East and the Mediterranean Sea helped the Turks gain complete control of major trade routes, and an ideal environment allowed plants and animals to flourish. Turkish cuisine was well established by the mid-1400s, the beginning of the Ottoman Empire's six hundred-year reign. Yogurt salads, fish <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> and stuffed and wrapped vegetables became Turkish staples. The empire, eventually spanning from Austria to northern Africa, used its land and water routes to import exotic ingredients from all over the world. By the end of the 16th century, the Ottoman court housed over 1,400 live-in cooks and passed laws regulating the freshness of food. Since the fall of the empire in World War I (1914–1918) and the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923, foreign food such as French hollandaise sauce and western fast food have made their way into the modern Turkish diet.|$|E
30|$|Chemical and {{physical}} features (i.e., acidity or polyphenols) are traditionally relevant <b>in</b> differentiating <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> {{with respect to}} taste and nutritional properties. These features basically stem from the plant variety, the cultivation and harvesting techniques, {{as well as from}} the processing technology (De Gennaro et al. 2009). In particular, the acidity content remains the most relevant element for vertical differentiation <b>in</b> the <b>olive</b> <b>oil</b> market.

40|$|This study {{describes}} two novel analytical techniques {{based on}} 31 P NMR spectroscopy for {{the determination of}} (a) glycerol in Greek wines of Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) and extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils,</b> and (b) moisture <b>in</b> extra virgin <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> This methodology {{is based on the}} replacement of the two hydrogen atoms of the water molecule with tagging phosphorus agents {{and the use of the}} 31 P chemical shifts to identify the phosphitylated compounds. Quantification of glycerol <b>in</b> wines and <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> and moisture <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oils</b> was accomplished by integration of the appropriate signals in the 31 P NMR spectra and the use of phosphitylated internal standards. The method was reproducible and accurate. A comparison study was conducted and the agreement between 31 P NMR and HPLC methods for the glycerol determination, and between NMR and Karl Fisher titration was evaluated by using the Bland & Altman statistical analysis. Also, 31 P NMR spectroscopy with no derivatization was employed for the quantification of phospholipids extracted from <b>olive</b> <b>oils.</b> This method was faster, simpler and more accurate than conventional analytical techniques. ...|$|R

In northern Israel young flowerheads, stems and leaves are fried <b>in</b> <b>olive</b> <b>oil,</b> mixed with a stew of meat chops until well done, and served mixed with yogurt. Gundelia is said have a taste between asparagus and artichoke.
