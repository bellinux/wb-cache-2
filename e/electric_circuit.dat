40|$|This study {{explored}} {{the impact of}} a reflective teaching method on pre-service elementary teachers’ conceptual understanding of the lunar phases, reasons for seasons, and simple <b>electric</b> <b>circuits.</b> Data were collected from 40 pre-service elementary teachers about their conceptual understanding of the lunar phases, reasons for seasons and day and night, and simple <b>electric</b> <b>circuits</b> pre and post instruction. Findings show that the instructional approach adopted by a science teacher educator {{had a significant impact on}} pre-service elementary school teachers’ conceptual understanding of lunar phases, seasonal changes and simple <b>electric</b> <b>circuits.</b> The discussion focuses on pre-service elementary school teachers’ misconceptions about the lunar phases, seasonal changes and simple <b>electric</b> <b>circuits</b> as revealed through their answers to the pre-test questions. Further discussion focuses on the implications of the findings for pre-service elementary school science teacher education...|$|R

5|$|Mephedrone {{is a white}} substance. It is sold most {{commonly}} as crystals or a powder, {{but also in the}} form of capsules or pills. It can have a distinctive odour, reported to range from a synthetic fishy smell to the smell of vanilla and bleach, stale urine, or <b>electric</b> <b>circuit</b> boards.|$|E
5|$|The {{components}} in an <b>electric</b> <b>circuit</b> {{can take many}} forms, which can include elements such as resistors, capacitors, switches, transformers and electronics. Electronic circuits contain active components, usually semiconductors, and typically exhibit non-linear behaviour, requiring complex analysis. The simplest electric components {{are those that are}} termed passive and linear: while they may temporarily store energy, they contain no sources of it, and exhibit linear responses to stimuli.|$|E
5|$|By {{historical}} convention, {{a positive}} current {{is defined as}} having the same direction of flow as any positive charge it contains, or to flow from the most positive part of a circuit to the most negative part. Current defined in this manner is called conventional current. The motion of negatively charged electrons around an <b>electric</b> <b>circuit,</b> {{one of the most}} familiar forms of current, is thus deemed positive in the opposite direction to that of the electrons. However, depending on the conditions, an electric current can consist of a flow of charged particles in either direction, or even in both directions at once. The positive-to-negative convention is widely used to simplify this situation.|$|E

5|$|At {{the behest}} of the Paris Observatory under le Verrier, Marie Alfred Cornu {{repeated}} Fizeau's 1848 toothed wheel measurement in a series of experiments in 1872–76. The goal was to obtain a value for the speed of light accurate to one part in a thousand. Cornu's equipment allowed him to monitor high orders of extinction, up to the 21st order. Instead of estimating the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, a relatively inaccurate procedure, Cornu made pairs of observations {{on either side of the}} intensity minima, averaging the values obtained with the wheel spun clockwise and counterclockwise. An <b>electric</b> <b>circuit</b> recorded the wheel rotations on a chronograph chart which enabled precise rate comparisons against the observatory clock, and a telegraph key arrangement allowed Cornu to mark on this same chart the precise moments when he judged that an extinction had been entered or exited. His final experiment was run over a path nearly three times as long as that used by Fizeau, and yielded a figure of 300400km/s that is within 0.2% of the modern value.|$|E
5|$|The {{essence of}} network {{synthesis}} {{is to start}} with a required filter response and produce a network that delivers that response, or approximates to it within a specified boundary. This is the inverse of network analysis which starts with a given network and by applying the various <b>electric</b> <b>circuit</b> theorems predicts the response of the network. The term was first used with this meaning in the doctoral thesis of Yuk-Wing Lee (1930) and apparently arose out of a conversation with Vannevar Bush. The advantage of network synthesis over previous methods is that it provides a solution which precisely meets the design specification. This is not the case with image filters, a degree of experience is required in their design since the image filter only meets the design specification in the unrealistic case of being terminated in its own image impedance, to produce which would require the exact circuit being sought. Network synthesis on the other hand, takes care of the termination impedances simply by incorporating them into the network being designed.|$|E
5|$|Oxidative {{phosphorylation}} {{works by}} using energy-releasing chemical reactions to drive energy-requiring reactions: The {{two sets of}} reactions {{are said to be}} coupled. This means one cannot occur without the other. The flow of electrons through the electron transport chain, from electron donors such as NADH to electron acceptors such as oxygen, is an exergonic process– it releases energy, whereas the synthesis of ATP is an endergonic process, which requires an input of energy. Both the electron transport chain and the ATP synthase are embedded in a membrane, and energy is transferred from electron transport chain to the ATP synthase by movements of protons across this membrane, in a process called chemiosmosis. In practice, this is like a simple <b>electric</b> <b>circuit,</b> with a current of protons being driven from the negative N-side of the membrane to the positive P-side by the proton-pumping enzymes of the electron transport chain. These enzymes are like a battery, as they perform work to drive current through the circuit. The movement of protons creates an electrochemical gradient across the membrane, which is often called the proton-motive force. It has two components: a difference in proton concentration (a H+ gradient, ΔpH) and a difference in electric potential, with the N-side having a negative charge.|$|E

25|$|When a {{chemical}} reaction {{is caused by}} an externally supplied current, as in electrolysis, or if an electric current is produced by a spontaneous chemical reaction as in a battery, it is called an electrochemical reaction. Chemical reactions where electrons are transferred directly between molecules and/or atoms are called oxidation-reduction or (redox) reactions. In general, electrochemistry describes the overall reactions when individual redox reactions are separate but connected by an external <b>electric</b> <b>circuit</b> and an intervening electrolyte.|$|E

25|$|To {{provide a}} {{complete}} <b>electric</b> <b>circuit,</b> there {{must also be}} an ionic conduction path between the anode and cathode electrolytes {{in addition to the}} electron conduction path. The simplest ionic conduction path is to provide a liquid junction. To avoid mixing between the two electrolytes, the liquid junction can be provided through a porous plug that allows ion flow while reducing electrolyte mixing. To further minimize mixing of the electrolytes, a salt bridge can be used which consists of an electrolyte saturated gel in an inverted U-tube. As the negatively charged electrons flow in one direction around this circuit, the positively charged metal ions flow in the opposite direction in the electrolyte.|$|E
25|$|The main {{inefficiency}} in {{a common}} thermal working machine is the expansion valve, which allows to pass the refrigerant liquid from the low pressure blow pressure without using the potential energy available. This patented and published invention in 2017 by Giuseppe Verde adopts a special technique based on power regeneration for internal cycles, {{in order to reduce}} the consumption of electricity. Innovation is therefore linked to the insertion of a heat exchanger for the recovery of energy and an alternator within a conventional refrigeration system. Applying this device results in a high improvement in energy efficiency and refrigeration capacity. Both of these effects increase when the operating temperature and the evaporation temperature decrease. In addition, an advantageous object of the present invention is the insertion of an electric charge accumulator comprising an automatic timed control system for switching off the <b>electric</b> <b>circuit,</b> which guarantees the possibility of economically benefiting the multi-hour tariff electric energy.|$|E

40|$|Prior {{research}} has highlighted {{that students have}} many conceptual difficulties regarding <b>electric</b> <b>circuits</b> and that traditional teaching methods are not successful in overcoming these difficulties. In addressing this issue, this research project placed its primary focus {{on the development of}} research based and research validated curriculum which systematically promotes the development of a scientific model for <b>electric</b> <b>circuits.</b> Over the last four years, the project focussed on developing and assessing two separate inquiry based <b>electric</b> <b>circuits</b> curricula. The first curriculum was implemented in an <b>electric</b> <b>circuits</b> module for pre-service science teachers and addressed the concept of voltage in a variety of contexts, including multiple batteries in multiple loops and RC circuits. This thesis details how the curriculum addressed the concept of voltage qualitatively and how it helped students resolve their difficulty in differentiating between voltage and current. The research also highlighted a number of newly identified difficulties pertaining to these topics. The second curriculum was implemented in a lab-based module for non-physics undergraduates. The investigation of students‘ conceptual understanding of dc circuits along with the process of adapting inquiry based curriculum to an undergraduate laboratory setting is discussed. The comparison of pretest and posttest data in both modules has shown that through the use of this curriculum the majority of students have improved their conceptual understanding of many <b>electric</b> <b>circuits</b> concepts...|$|R
