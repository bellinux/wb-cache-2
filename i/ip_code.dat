50|$|The {{enclosure}} protection {{types are}} defined {{according to the}} <b>IP</b> <b>codes</b> of EN 60529. The basic versions of most electric actuators are designed to the second highest enclosure protection IP 67. This means they are protected against the ingress of dust and water during immersion (30 min at a max. head of water of 1 m). Most actuator manufacturers also supply devices to enclosure protection IP 68 which provides protection against submersion up to a max. head of water of 6 m.|$|R

30|$|The {{use of the}} {{counters}} depends on whether the <b>IP's</b> <b>code</b> is accessible or not. For white-box IPs, {{the counters}} can be inserted into their source code while for black-box ones, provided that their source code is not accessible, the activity occurrences are detected using standalone modules connected to these IPs. Our hybrid approach combines these two techniques in order to estimate the consumption of a system composed of both white-box and black-box IPs. In the following subsections, we detail consumption estimation techniques for white-box and black-box IPs.|$|R

50|$|The <b>IP</b> <b>Code,</b> International Protection Marking, IEC {{standard}} 60529, sometimes {{interpreted as}} Ingress Protection Marking, classifies and rates {{the degree of}} protection provided against intrusion (body parts such as hands and fingers), dust, accidental contact, and water by mechanical casings and electrical enclosures.

50|$|Vandal-resistant {{switches}} {{often need}} to be water and dust resistant due to their environments. Some types are potted to make them waterproof. The International Electrotechnical Commission has produced a standard, IEC 60529, which categorizes products' degrees of protection from liquids and dust using <b>IP</b> <b>codes.</b> A DIN extension of the IEC standard, DIN 40050-9 further defines Degree of Protection IP 69K as being able to withstand high-pressure washing or steam cleaning. This capability is needed in some particular applications, such as dairy milking machines, and is provided by some manufacturers' products.|$|R

50|$|Before {{the advent}} of the IK code, a third numeral had been {{occasionally}} added to the closely related <b>IP</b> <b>Code</b> on ingress protection, to indicate the level of impact protection — e.g. IP66(9). Nonstandard use of this system was one of the factors leading to the development of this standard, which uses a separate two numeral code to distinguish it from the old differing systems. The standard came into effect in October 1995 and conflicting national standards had to be withdrawn by April 1997.|$|E
40|$|The {{complementing}} {{strengths of}} Constraint (Logic) Programming (CLP) and Mixed Integer Programming (IP) have recently received signicant attention. Although various optimization and constraint programming packages at a rst glance {{seem to support}} mixed models, the modeling and solution techniques encapsulated are still rudimentary. Apart from exchanging bounds for variables and objective, little is known {{of what constitutes a}} good hybrid model and how a hybrid solver can utilize the complementary strengths of inference and relaxations. This paper adds to the eld by identifying constraints as the essential link between CLP and IP and introduces an algorithm for bidirectional inference through these constraints. Together with new search strategies for hybrid solvers and cut-generating mixed global constraints, solution speed is improved over both traditional <b>IP</b> <b>codes</b> and newer mixed solvers.

30|$|An {{accurate}} power {{estimation method}} {{is based on}} a characterization phase using low-level tools {{in order to determine the}} consumption of the different activities of a hardware component accurately. The obtained power model is then used during simulations to estimate the consumption of the related component.

The most important challenge here is how to detect these activities especially if the intellectual property (<b>IP)</b> description <b>codes</b> are not accessible.|$|R
50|$|German {{standard}} DIN 40050-9 {{extended the}} older IEC 60529 rating system with an IP69K rating for high-pressure, high-temperature wash-down applications.

By 2013 IEC 60529 added level 9 water ingress testing, with IPx9 being essentially the same spray test as IP69K, also adding a drawing of a fixture to verify the water pressure.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid approach for energy estimation for systems-on-chip (SoC). This approach is applicable for both white-box and black-box IPs. For white-box IPs, our approach inserts activity counters into the <b>IP</b> <b>codes</b> {{in order to}} detect the activity occurrences and determining the consumption of these activities, during the simulation of a system. For black-box IPs, estimation modules are connected between the IPs in order to detect their activities through the signals that they exchange during the simulation. These modules were generated using an MDE approach. The simulated systems were also generated automatically from high-level models in the Gaspard 2 framework. In order to integrate the energy estimation in the design flow of this framework, we extended its deployment level. The simulations were implemented in SystemC at the CABA level. This high abstraction level allowed us to obtain fast simulations and quite accurate results due to an acceptable amount of architectural details that this abstraction level takes into account. In order to test the efficiency of our approach, we used {{a combination of the}} white-box and the black-box approaches for different system configurations. The simulation results showed that even if the <b>code</b> of an <b>IP</b> is not accessible, we can still obtain its consumption estimates with an acceptable accuracy. For this, we only need to detect, from the signals that it exchanges with the other components of a system, the activity that it is performing and associate its related consumption cost. In our future research, we plan to adapt our approach to more complex architectures including other components, such as other types of processors and interconnects. Measurements of the consumption from real implementations of the studied systems can also be considered, in our future works, in order to compare them with the results of the simulations.|$|R
