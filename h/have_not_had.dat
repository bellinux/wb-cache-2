5|$|Because of the 1994–95 Major League Baseball strike cut {{the season}} short and {{cancelled}} the post-season, the BBWAA writers effectively created {{a de facto}} mythical national championship (similar to college football) by naming managers of the unofficial league champions (lead the leagues in winning percentage) (Buck Showalter and Felipe Alou) as Managers of the Year. Two franchises, the New York Mets and the Milwaukee Brewers, <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> a manager win the award.|$|E

The church is within the deanery of Llifon and Talybolion, the archdeaconry of Bangor, and the Diocese of Bangor.|$|E

The Department of Health and Human Services has had five, the {{departments}} of State, Transportation, Commerce, and Education have had three, and the departments of Housing and Urban Development, and Justice have each had two. The defunct Department of Health, Education, and Welfare has also had two female Secretaries.

5|$|Coprinellus micaceus has a {{cosmopolitan}} distribution, {{and has been}} collected in northern Africa, South Africa, Europe (including Turkey), North America (as far north as Alaska), the Hawaiian islands, South America, India, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. Phylogenetic analysis of rDNA sequences from specimens collected in southeastern Asia and Hawaii show that the Hawaiian species form a distinct clade with little genetic diversity compared to Asian populations; {{this suggests that the}} Hawaiian populations have been introduced relatively recently and <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> much time to develop genetic variation. One study suggests that in South Africa, where C.micaceus is rare, it has been frequently confused with the similar-appearing C.truncorum, a more common species in that region. A similar inference has been raised about North American species.|$|E
5|$|In cricket, a batsman {{reaches a}} century when he scores 100 or more {{runs in a}} single innings. A century is {{regarded}} as a landmark score for a batsman, and his number of centuries is generally recorded in his career statistics. The Indian Premier League (IPL) is a professional league for Twenty20 cricket in India, which has been held annually since its first edition in 2008. In the ten seasons played, 47 centuries have been scored by 30 different batsmen. Players from eight of the eleven franchises have scored centuries; the only franchises that <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> a player score a century for them are Pune Warriors India, Kochi Tuskers Kerala and Gujarat Lions.|$|E

Black follows up on this, and investigates Nesbitt's pharmacy. Nesbitt is not working at the time, but Black realizes he must be the killer. He interviews Nesbitt's wife (Barbara Howard), finding that they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> sex in eighteen years of marriage—however, Nesbitt has recently become interested in trying again.|$|E

5|$|The Department of Treasury has had {{the most}} {{foreign-born}} Secretaries, with five. Department of Labor and Interior follow with three, and the departments of Housing and Urban Development and State have each had two. Former Secretaries of State Henry Kissinger and Madeleine Albright were the highest-ranking foreign-born Cabinet members ever in accordance to the United States presidential line of succession. The majority of foreign-born Cabinet members were born in Europe. Most European-born Cabinet members originated from the United Kingdom and Germany with five and four respectively, {{and the others were}} born in Ireland, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland and Italy. Four Cabinet members were born in the Americas, and one was born in Asia. The departments of Defense, Justice, Health and Human Services, Energy, Education, Veterans Affairs and Homeland Security <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> foreign-born Secretaries.|$|E

Luxembourg hosts the Translation Centre for the Bodies of the European Union and the European Investment Bank. Strasbourg hosts the office of the European Ombudsman. The other agencies are spread across Europe and since the 2004 enlargement, there has been a drive to locate more agencies in the new member-states to make a more equal distribution.|$|E
5|$|Twelve {{players have}} {{received}} either the Naismith or Wooden National Player of the Year awards {{in the same}} year that they received an ACC Player of the Year award. North Carolina's Tyler Hansbrough is the most recent player to achieve this; the consensus national player of the year in 2008, he won every major national award in addition to the conference player of the year award. Duke and North Carolina are tied for the most winners with 15 apiece. Each of the original 1953ACC members has had at least one of its players win the award. Five ACC members <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> a winner: Florida State, Louisville, Notre Dame, Pittsburgh, and Syracuse. However, of these schools, only Florida State joined the ACC before 2013.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the 50 states and federal district, the United States has sovereignty over 14 territories. Five of them (American Samoa, Guam, the Northern Mariana Islands, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands) have a permanent, nonmilitary population, while nine of them do not. With the exception of Navassa Island, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, which {{are located in the}} Caribbean, all territories are located in the Pacific Ocean. One territory, Palmyra Atoll, is considered to be incorporated, meaning the full body of the Constitution has been applied to it; the other territories are unincorporated, meaning the Constitution does not fully apply to them. Ten territories (the Minor Outlying Islands and American Samoa) are considered to be unorganized, meaning they <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> an Organic Act enacted by Congress; the four other territories are organized, meaning they have had an Organic Act that has been enacted by Congress. The five inhabited territories each have limited autonomy and a non-voting delegate in Congress, in {{addition to}} having territorial legislatures and governors, but residents cannot vote in federal elections.|$|E

5|$|Two nonprofit {{organizations}} manage the park, which NYC Parks owns and operates. Van Cortlandt Park Conservancy, a private nonprofit organization founded in 2009, manages educational and cultural programs, and maintains the recreational areas. The Friends of Van Cortlandt Park, an independent nonprofit established in 1992, provides educational programs and assists in the upkeep of the park's natural areas. However, {{the two organizations}} <b>have</b> <b>not</b> <b>had</b> {{the same amount of}} funding as similar private organizations who manage parks in wealthier areas of the city. In 2013, Friends of Van Cortlandt Park only raised $416,612—as opposed to the Central Park Conservancy, which in 2016 had an $81 million endowment to maintain Central Park, or the Four Freedoms Parks Conservancy, which raised $8 million in 2011 alone for the construction of the Four Freedoms Park. Before 1992, there was no private maintenance of the park; the earliest efforts for such a thing date to 1983, when an administrator was appointed to oversee both Van Cortlandt and Pelham Bay Parks.|$|E
