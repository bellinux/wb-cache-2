40|$|Investment Companies are {{financial}} intermediaries between investors and investments. Investors buy shares in Investment Companies, which are entities that invest these share revenues {{in order to}} make income from dividends, received interests and capital <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> of investments. One of the issues an Investment Company has to address in providing useful information is the selection of valuation methods to value the company's investments for financial statement purposes. There are a number of recommendations for valuing these investments produced by organizations, such as EVCA, BVCA and NVCA. This thesis examines Investment Companies in Sweden, the United States and the United Kingdom and their valuation methods for valuing portfolio companies. The study also analyzes why different methods in certain circumstances are applied {{and the extent to which}} valuation procedures in the three countries are harmonized. The study concludes with an examination on how Swedish companies' valuation methods influence the disclosure of the Net Asset Value. The analysis of the theoretical and empirical findings shows that the valuation methods in Sweden are to some extent focused on EVCA's valuation guidelines. Furthermore, the procedures in the United Kingdom are congruent to the guidelines provided by the BVCA. The analysis of the studied companies in the United States, indicates that the valuation procedures are vague and generally based on the companies' own principles. The result of this research also concludes that there are various degrees of standardization within the three countries, and explains how these differences influence the harmonization process of valuation procedures...|$|E
40|$|Investors in {{depreciable}} assets {{used in a}} trade or business claim depreciation deductions following investment, and upon sale or other disposition of their assets are taxed on gain or loss equal to differences between amounts realized and adjusted basis. The taxation of these realized gains and losses is asymmetric: losses are deductible against ordinary income, whereas {{a portion of the}} gain on sales of personal property, and virtually all <b>gains</b> <b>on</b> <b>sales</b> of real property, are taxed at more favorable capital gain tax rates. Evidence from U. S. tax returns in 2012 indicates that the aggregate annual magnitude of the tax saving due to the asymmetric taxation of these gains and losses is relatively modest, roughly between $ 800 million and $ 1. 71 billion. This paper considers the policy basis of this asymmetric tax treatment, noting that depreciation rules together with the elective nature of sale and realization implies that the tax system inefficiently discourages sales of depreciable business assets on which taxpayers have unrealized gains. In order to maintain efficient reallocation of used assets it is necessary to tax realized gains rather lightly. Taxpayers with unrealized losses on depreciable property have the option of retaining or discarding the property, in the first case claiming subsequent depreciation deductions against ordinary income and in the second claiming an immediate ordinary loss. The availability of these options implies that limiting the tax rate applicable to deductions for losses on sales of {{depreciable assets}} again would also inefficiently discourage asset sales. Consequently, the elective nature of asset sales implies that an efficient system imposes asymmetric taxes on gains and losses from sales of depreciable assets...|$|E
40|$|As you know, {{these have}} been {{challenging}} times for the mortgage industry. Despite the difficult environment, our company’s fundamental goals of building net interest income, <b>gain</b> <b>on</b> <b>sale</b> revenue and servicing income remain unchanged. Today, the employees and officers of American Home Mortgage are working to respond to current marketplace challenges, {{while at the same}} time, positioning our company to be a prime beneficiary of a gradual recovery in the mortgage industry. Our core focus is to restore our financial performance which has been adversely affected by high delinquency-related charges and lower <b>gain</b> <b>on</b> <b>sale</b> margins. To reduce delinquency charges we have discontinued offering the product type that caused a large portion of our delinquency expenses. Over time, this change should cause our delinquency-related charges to diminish. Our <b>gain</b> <b>on</b> <b>sale</b> will be largely affected by conditions in the secondary mortgage market, causing improvements to our <b>gain</b> <b>on</b> <b>sale</b> margin to become more difficult to achieve. Consequently, our outlook is for reduced <b>gain</b> <b>on</b> <b>sale</b> margins through the balance of the year. I {{would like to thank the}} employees and officers of American Home Mortgage for their hard work and dedication. Through their strong efforts, we have continued to build our franchise.
