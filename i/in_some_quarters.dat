5|$|There {{seems to}} prevail the opinion <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>quarters</b> that this meeting {{has been called}} {{for the purpose of}} inaugurating a riot, hence these warlike {{preparations}} on the part of so-called 'law and order.' However, let me tell you at the beginning that this meeting has not been called for any such purpose. The object of this meeting is to explain the general situation of the eight-hour movement and to throw light upon various incidents in connection with it.|$|E
5|$|Brown's form {{started to}} {{deteriorate}} in 1937–38; he scored only 400 runs at 36.36 for the season. Queensland played five matches under his watch, losing three, and went without victory. Of the two draws, one was washed out {{and in the}} other, Queensland hung on with two wickets in hand when time ran out. Although Brown compiled two centuries, he was only twelfth in the aggregates during an Australian season with no international tours. As a result, his selection for the 1938 tour to England was criticised <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>quarters.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cleared of any {{responsibility}} for McKay's death, Byrne collected his £200 prize money, {{and as the}} winner {{earned the right to}} fight the English heavyweight champion Jem Ward. The fight was originally scheduled to take place at Leicester on 10 March 1829, but at the last minute Ward claimed that he was unfit and too ill to fight, much to the disapproval of his backers and friends. Rumours circulated that Ward had refused to enter the ring unless he received a prize money of £250 plus an additional £250 if he lost; the event became known <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>quarters</b> as the Leicester Hoax. Ward did not fight again for two years, but he and Byrne finally met on 12 July 1831 at Willeycott, near Stratford upon Avon. Each fighter was paid £200. Although Ward was the older man he prevailed in the contest after one hour and seventeen minutes, when Byrne's seconds, Tom Spring and Tom Reynolds, withdrew their man in the 33rd round.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the discoveries}} of Richard's remains in 2012, {{it was decided}} that they should be reburied at Leicester Cathedral, despite {{feelings}} <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>quarters</b> that he should have been reburied in York Minster. His remains were carried in procession to the cathedral on 22 March 2015, and reburied on 26 March 2015 at a religious re-burial service at which both the Right Reverend Tim Stevens, the Bishop of Leicester, and the Most Reverend Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, officiated. The British Royal Family was represented by the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester and the Countess of Wessex. The actor Benedict Cumberbatch, who is a distant relation of the king and later portrayed him in The Hollow Crown television series, read a poem by Poet Laureate Carol Ann Duffy.|$|E
5|$|Rice cultivation: In 2002, a Chinese and Japanese group {{reported}} the discovery in eastern China of fossilised phytoliths of domesticated rice apparently {{dating back to}} 11,900 BC or earlier. However, phytolith data are controversial <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>quarters</b> due to potential contamination problems. It is likely that demonstrated rice was cultivated in the middle Yangtze Valley by 7000 BC, as shown in finds from the Pengtoushan culture at Bashidang, Changde, Hunan. By 5000 BC, rice had been domesticated at Hemudu culture near the Yangtze Delta and was being cooked in pots. Although millet remained the main crop in northern China throughout history, several sporadic attempts {{were made by the}} state to introduce rice around the Bohai Gulf as early as the 1st century.|$|E
5|$|Sherman and Hayes {{agreed to}} {{stockpile}} gold {{in preparation for}} the exchange of greenbacks for specie. The Act remained unpopular <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>quarters,</b> leading to four attempts to repeal it in the Senate and fourteen in the House—all unsuccessful. By this time, public confidence in the Treasury had grown to the extent that a dollar in gold was worth only $1.05 in greenbacks. Once the public was confident that they could redeem greenbacks for gold, few actually did so; when the Act took effect in 1879, only $130,000 out of the $346,000,000 outstanding dollars in greenbacks were redeemed. Greenbacks were now at parity with gold dollars, and the nation had, {{for the first time since}} the Civil War, a unified monetary system.|$|E

5|$|The {{initial address}} {{received}} a mixed reception within the Congo. <b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>quarters</b> {{it was widely}} supported. However, some believed that it merely highlighted the fact that Lumumba was inexperienced (and overly provocative) in comparison with Kasa-Vubu's measured and diplomatic approach. Members of Lumumba's own party, including Kanza, praised the speech itself but believed that the venue in which it had been delivered was inappropriate. Lumumba's address was also notably acclaimed by figures within the international Pan-African and Black Power movements including Malcolm X. The speech may have further heightened racial violence between white settlers and native Congolese which were already distrustful. As {{a result of the}} threat to its expatriates, Belgium deployed troops to the country and, amid mounting violence, several regions of the Congo, notably Katanga, seceded and declared their own independence, starting five-years of violence and political unrest known as the Congo Crisis.|$|E
5|$|The {{only real}} {{threat of a}} black {{rebellion}} in Southern Rhodesia during the war occurred in May 1916, immediately after the Company instructed native commissioners in Matabeleland to start recruiting for the Rhodesia Native Regiment. Company officials attempted {{to make clear that}} the RNR comprised volunteers only, and most Matabele chiefs were not unreceptive to the idea—some, including Chief Ndiweni, attempted to encourage enlistment by sending their own sons off to war—but rumours spread <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>quarters</b> that black men were going to be involuntarily conscripted wholesale into the unit. Chief Maduna, in Insiza district, briefly threatened insurrection, issuing rifles to 100 men, but he backed down after a few weeks after it became self-evident that conscription was not happening. Some attempted to dissuade potential RNR recruits from signing up, including a black man in Bulawayo who was fined £4 in July 1915 for spreading a false rumour around the city that the British East Africa Transport Corps' black Southern Rhodesian drivers had had their throats cut by the Germans. Matthew Zwimba, founder of the syncretist Church of the White Bird in Mashonaland, received six months' hard labour the following year for advising black men not to join the RNR {{on the grounds that the}} British had, he said, committed crimes against God in 1913.|$|E
5|$|Whimpress tabled various {{hypotheses}} for Crockett's actions. At the time, Crockett was 37 {{years old}} {{and was ready to}} emerge from the shadow of Phillips, the eminent Australian umpire of the time. When Crockett called Marsh, it was his 29th match as a first-class umpire and the no-balling was seen <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>quarters</b> as a signal that he felt ready to officiate in Test matches. A cynical view of Crockett's calls held that if throwing was to be eradicated then the umpire was going to choose a soft target. This theory ruled out the calling of a fellow Victorian, his state of origin. The same line of reasoning concluded that a New South Welshman would be called, and likely not a high-profile Test player like Noble or Jack Saunders. Those who adhered to this hypothesis believed that it would be easier for Crockett to target someone who had a previous stigma of throwing and that Marsh—an aborigine who led the bowling averages with 21 wickets at 17.38—was an ideal target.|$|E

60|$|Up to {{this point}} Somerset's {{progress}} in his suit had been, though incomplete, so uninterrupted, that he almost feared the good chance he enjoyed. How should it be in a mortal of his calibre to command success with such a sweet woman for long? He might, indeed, {{turn out to be}} one of the singular exceptions which are said to prove rules; but when fortune means to men most good, observes the bard, she looks upon them with a threatening eye. Somerset would even have been content that a little disapproval of his course should have occurred <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>quarter,</b> so as to make his wooing more like ordinary life. But Paula was not clearly won, and that was drawback sufficient. In these pleasing agonies and painful delights he passed the journey to Markton.|$|R
60|$|It may {{therefore}} be asserted that Lady Mason's widowed life was successful. That it was prudent and well conducted {{no one could}} doubt. Her neighbours of course did say of her {{that she would not}} drink tea with Mrs. Arkwright of Mount Pleasant villa because she was allowed the privilege of entering Sir Peregrine's drawing-room; but such little scandal as this was a matter of course. Let one live according to any possible or impossible rule, yet some offence will be given <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>quarter.</b> Those who knew anything of Lady Mason's private life were aware that she did not encroach on Sir Peregrine's hospitality. She was not at The Cleeve as much as circumstances would have justified, and at one time by no means so much as Mrs. Orme would have desired.|$|R
40|$|An agent {{may be able}} {{to address}} a task at {{different}} times, with the state of nature more favorable to the task <b>in</b> <b>some</b> periods over oth-ers. Success on a task will therefore more greatly improve the agent’s reputation following success on a task if he is constrained in choosing when to address the task than if he enjoys flexibility in timing. These considerations may explain why presidents emphasize achievements in their first hundred days in office, and why performance of the economy <b>in</b> only <b>some</b> <b>quarters</b> of a president’s term affect elections...|$|R

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>some</b> <b>quarters</b> an {{argument}} is advanced that as {{on this occasion}} the proclamation was read by Ali on behalf of Muhammad, this establishes the precedence of Ali over Abu Bakr, and that therefore when {{after the death of}} Muhammad, Abu Bakr became the Caliph in disregard of the claims of Ali, he was a usurper.|$|E
5000|$|Later interpretations counsel {{resorting to}} reason {{in order to}} avoid harm, in this life or thereafter. Samuel Croxall ends the ‘application’ in his Fables of Aesop and Others (1722) on the thought that “it becomes us, as we are {{reasonable}} Creatures, to behave ourselves as such and to do as few Things as possible of which we may have Occasion to repent”. Thomas Bewick, in his retelling of 1818, goes much further and proclaims a chauvinistic religious message. “There is no opinion, however impious or absurd, that has not its advocates <b>in</b> <b>some</b> <b>quarter</b> of the world. Whoever, therefore, takes up his creed upon trust, and grounds his principles on no better reason than his being a native or inhabitant of the regions wherein they prevail, becomes a disciple of Mahomet in Turkey, and of Confucius in China; a Jew, or a Pagan, as the accident of birth decides.” ...|$|R
