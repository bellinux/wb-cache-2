The flame-retardant properties of the materials were evaluated by the limiting oxygen index (LOI), the UL- 94 rating and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The results showed that the addition of highly expanded clays to the ammonium polyphosphate and pentaerythritol formulation does not significantly increase the flame retardancy of the mixture, when measured by the LOI and UL- 94.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{particle}} size reduction {{of the components of}} a common intumescent flame retardant system, consisting of pentaerythritol (PER) and ammonium polyphosphate (APP) in a weight ratio of 1 to 2, was investigated on the flammability and mechanical performance of flame retarded polypropylene (PP) compounds. Additives of reduced particle size were obtained by ball milling. In the case of PER, the significant reduction of particle size resulted in inferior flame retardant and mechanical performance, while the systems containing milled APP noticeably outperformed the reference <b>intumescent</b> <b>system</b> containing as-received additives. The beneficial effect of the {{particle size reduction}} of APP is explained by the better distribution of the particles in the polymer matrix and by the modified degradation mechanism which results in the formation of an effectively protecting carbonaceous foam accompanied with improved mechanical resistance.

40|$|This work aims to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of halloysite as synergistic agent in an <b>intumescent</b> PP <b>system</b> based on a coated ammonium polyphosphate (IFR). The {{first part of the}} study analyses the thermal stability and fire performance of PP when using the intumescent formulation alone or in combination with the aluminosilicate nanotubes (HNTs). Cone calorimetry reveals that partial substitution of IFR by HNTs (3 wt. %) imparts substantial improvement in flame retardancy with reduced heat release rate and longer burning times. Additionally, a shift from V- 1 to V- 0 classification is achieved at the UL- 94 test with only 1. 5 wt. % HNTs. The second part provides {{a better understanding of the}} physical and chemical mechanisms of action of HNTs in the <b>intumescent</b> <b>systems.</b> The chemical evolution of the condensed phase during combustion is described by solid state NMR, and in particular using 2 D NMR.

These new chemical species allow thermal stabilization of the char at high temperatures and provide good macro- and micro-structural properties.

The ER imparts good flame retardancy and non-dripping for polyethylene (PE) when combined with ammonium polyphosphate to yield an intumescent polyethylene (PE–IFR). The performance of this <b>intumescent</b> <b>system</b> has been enhanced {{by the addition of}} small amounts (0. 2 %) chelated copper(II) salicylaldehyde (CuSA) and salicylaldoxime, (CuSAO).

The onset of decomposition in TGA for flame retarded PE (PE–IFR, PE–IFR–CuSA and PE–IFR–CuSAO) commences at lower temperature than that of PE with release of blowing agent, but continues to a higher temperature, leaving a greater residue.

Our <b>intumescent</b> <b>system</b> consists in using classical flame retardants such as ammonium polyphosphate, pentaerythritol in combination with porous mesostructured silica (SBA- 15) fillers. Prior to use, SBA- 15 was chemically modified using different organic and inorganic grafts {{in order to obtain}} some specific properties, such as an improved compatibility with the polymer, or different types of surface acidity in order to increase charring reactions. Limiting oxygen index, UL- 94, pyrolysis flow combustion calorimetry and thermogravimetric analysis were used to assess the burning behavior and thermal stability, respectively, of the processed composites. By keeping the total amount of additives always equal to 25 wt%, the better flammability characteristics were in general obtained at low SBA- 15 loadings (< 2 wt%). X-ray diffraction and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy analyses of the residues showed that the formation of a barrier mainly constituted by crystalline silicon phosphates is probably a key to enhance the fire properties.

Zeolite was incorporated into flame retardant formulation at four different concentrations (1, 2, 5, and 10 wt%) to investigate synergism with the flame retardant materials.

30|$|Intumescent {{flame retardants}} (IFR) have {{attracted}} considerable attention {{in recent years}} due to its low toxicity, absence of dioxins, and low smoke production in fire accidents. In addition, IFR is halogen-free, which {{is considered to be}} eco-friendly and safe for the environment and ecosystem [1, 2]. In general, the intumescent formulations contain three main ingredients, namely, an acidic source, a carbonization agent compound, and a blowing agent [3, 4]. In spite of the considerable number of <b>intumescent</b> <b>systems</b> developed in the past years, the typical and widely studied IFR system is ammonium polyphosphate (APP) and pentaerythritol (PER) [3, 5]. APP is known to be preferred over other flame retardants due to its high amounts of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N), thermal stability and smaller loading, and a lower cost, excellent processing ability [3, 4]. The acidic source is usually a P derivative, in most cases APP. APP is also believed to be served as a blowing agent in the intumescent formulation {{as a part of the}} ammonia and water emitted during pyrolysis [3, 5]. Therefore, APP could act as the acidic source and blowing agent at the same time during combustion [4, 5]. The carbonization agent usually employed polyhydric alcohols which is easily degraded by acid [5].|$|R

In order to investigate the synergism between colemanite and the flame retardant materials (APP and PER), D-optimal mixture design was employed. The limiting oxygen index (LOI) and amount of residue (AoR) were accepted as response 1 and response 2, respectively. Applying D-optimal strategy, 18 experiments were performed. Filler content was fixed at 30 wt% of total amounts of flame retardant PP composites. Constraints were determined according to the ratio of APP/PER ranging between 1 and 3. Statistical analysis of the cubic model revealed that lack of fit (LoF) was not significant for the cubic and linear model for both responses. The model suggested an optimum composite formulation with concentration levels 65 % of APP, 28 % of PER and 7 % of colemanite that gives an LOI of 40. 3.

Nevertheless, systems with only low amounts (≤ 1 wt%) of TRGO achieved V- 0 classification in the UL 94 test and high oxygen indices (> 31 vol%).

A test procedure was developed to measure the char-forming rate which proved to be well correlated with flame retardancy. The possible composition of intumescent char was suggested based on infrared, XPS, and elemental analysis. The presence of polycondensed phosphorus acids with some PNH bonds appears likely.

The organic intercalation agents in the layers of MMT play important roles in the char formation and flame retardant properties of PP composites.

The LOI and UL- 94 properties increase firstly and then decrease as the content of MMT increases. The MA acts as a blowing agent and emits an inert gas to provide migration impetus, which results in a better intumescent structured and stronger char to endure heat erosion. Although TPP and TTP emit combustible gas that burn, especially for TTP as it has a more flammable aliphatic chain.

To investigate thermal behaviour of flame retardant PP composites with and without zeolite, samples were heated on optic microscope hot stage. Both of the composites behaved similarly during heating from room temperature to 203 oC. Molten pentaerythritol was observed as a second phase in molten polypropylene at 203 oC. Bubble formations were not observed. Flame retardants did not cause any foam formation during processing of mixture at 190 oC in rheomixer and hot press. SEM pictures of non-burnt and burnt flame retardant (FR) PP composites with and without zeolites did not reveal significant difference considering foam size and shape compared to composites without zeolite. Zeolite crystals did not exhibit any deformation during burning of composite. Flammability of FR-PP composites were determined by UL- 94 flame test in air.

The use of water during extrusion promotes a nanoscale homogenization of the clay via a combination of physical and chemical effects. Next, structure-property relationships in these materials have been investigated in depth. Substantial improvements in mechanical, thermal and fire performances are observed when nanodispersion is achieved. The low flammability of HNTs-based nanocomposites in terms of heat release rate results from the build-up of an inorganic-rich surface layer limiting heat and mass transfers between gas and condensed phases. Highly loaded nanocomposite films coated on virgin polymer substrates can effectively speed up the barrier formation. However, nanocomposites fail other regulatory fire tests like UL- 94. To overcome this problem, halloysite has been combined with <b>intumescent</b> <b>systems.</b> Results show that the aluminosilicate acts as a synergistic agent offering an unexpected way for making fire safe polymers.

The effect of the additives on the combustion properties was characterised by Limiting Oxygen Index, UL 94 and mass loss calorimetric measurements.

40|$|The {{influence}} {{exerted by}} temperature on the resistant capacity of structural steel is well known. A highly efficient protection system for steel {{consists of the}} application of intumescent paints. In the case of fire, their effectiveness {{is based on the}} property that when they come into contact with flames they react by swelling to form an insulating layer, referred to as "intumescence", which impedes the propagation of heat. These paints do not require continuous maintenance though their service behaviour depends on the exposure conditions to which they are exposed. This paper studies the behaviour of two acrylated rubber type <b>intumescent</b> <b>systems</b> exposed to a galvanising plant for 16 months, evaluating the effect of the environment on the capacity to intumesce of the coating when subjected to heating. Es conocida la influencia que ejerce la temperatura en la capacidad resistente del acero estructural. Un sistema de protección del acero, altamente efectivo, consiste en la utilización de pinturas intumescentes. Su efectividad se basa en el hecho de que, en el caso eventual de un incendio, al entrar en contacto con la llama reaccionan hinchándose y formando una capa aislante que se denomina "intumescencia" y que impide la propagación del calor. Estas pinturas no precisan de un mantenimiento continuo, aunque su comportamiento en servicio depende de las condiciones de exposición. Este trabajo estudia el comportamiento de dos sistemas intumescentes de tipo caucho acrilado expuestos en una planta de galvanizado durante 16 meses, valorando el efecto del medio ambiente sobre la capacidad para intumescer del recubrimiento cuando es sometido a un calentamiento...|$|R

The HBPDP was characterized with FTIR and 1 HNMR. The IFRC {{was measured with}} thermogravimetric analysis. The data showed that the IFRC can meet the need of the processing temperature of most of thermoplastic. Intorduction <b>Intumescent</b> flame retardant <b>systems</b> {{have been used in}} some materials for many years. Traditional <b>intumescent</b> flame retardant <b>system</b> contains normally three components that are the basic elements to form a char: acid donor (ammonium polyphosphate), blowing agent (melamine) and carbon donor(pentaerythritol). Material containing such flame retardant system will form a char layer at the surface during combustion to protect the material [1]. These systems, which are used primarily as fire-proof coatings for steel and wooden materials, can now be successfully incorporated as flame retardant systems into polyolefins such as plastics. When the intumescent flame retardant are used in polyolefins, the mechanical and environmenta...|$|R

30|$|It is {{suggested}} that a suitable phosphorus/nitrogen/carbon (P/N/C) ratio in the IFR system {{is very important for}} its flame retardancy [4]. In this study, the proportion of lignosulfonate (carbonization agent)-to-APP (acid and blowing agent) ratios was studied to investigate the flame retardancy of lignosulfonate and APP combination in LRPU foams. As a natural macromolecule with substantial carbon–carbon bonds and abundant hydroxyl group, lignosulfonate could act as carbonization agent in <b>intumescent</b> flame retardant <b>system.</b>|$|R
40|$|Recent {{trends in}} flame retardancy of {{polyurethane}} foams (PUR) and, in general of polymers, have been deeply influenced by regulation requirements {{and also by}} the concept of “sustainable development” which implies that the fire retardants should present a low impact on human health and environment during the whole life cycle of the polymer; this concerns then also the toxicity and the density of smoke developed during burning of the materials. Therefore, {{the reduction of the}} amounts of brominated compounds used in flame retardancy formulations is actually one of the main aims of the research in this field, although this reduction is not very easy because of their very high effectiveness. In this chapter, novel halogen-free flame retardant systems for polyurethane foams are reviewed and discussed. The chapter deals in particular with charring compounds which may lead to the development of different char morphologies: compact, intumescent and “glassy-like” char layers. The advantages and disadvantages of each system on fire behaviour and thermal stability of polyurethane foams will be analysed. Particular attention will be put on possible synergistic effects arising from suitable mixing of them. The flame retardants analysed are phosphorus-based compounds (phosphates, elementary phosphorous and novel hypophosphites), <b>intumescent</b> <b>systems</b> (for example expandable graphite) as well as glass precursors like borates, alumino-silicates and glass modifiers. Since the recent interest in nanocomposites, potential application and benefits of layered silicates on fire behaviour and thermal stability of PUR foams will be also reported. In order to assess the effectiveness of the systems considered in enhancing the fire behaviour and thermal stability, PUR and PIR-PUR (polyisocyanurate-polyurethane) foams containing different amounts of them were prepared and tested in several ways. In particular the thermal stability, both in inert and oxidizing atmosphere, and fire behaviour through the limiting oxygen index (LOI) and use of cone calorimeter (CC) were analysed. Some results of SBI (Single Burning Item) test were also reported. Also the char morphology and composition were studied through use of scanning electron microscope (SEM) and elementary analysis (EDX, Energy Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy) ...|$|R
