5|$|While on a {{shopping}} {{trip to the}} Springfield Mall, Mr. Burns finds a penny in a water fountain and reaches in to grab it (fearing Ralph might take it) and falls in. The rushing water nearly drowns him, but Homer arrives and pulls {{him out of the}} water, saving Mr. Burns's life. To reward him, Mr. Burns offers to take Homer out to dinner. Homer says he likes Chicago deep dish pizza, so Mr. Burns takes him to Chicago on his private plane. On the plane, Homer is treated with luxury and gets serenaded by Lionel Richie. Homer has the time of his life in Chicago, but he becomes depressed on the return trip because he does not have the plane. Back in Springfield, Homer tells Marge that he is tired of being a normal person and becomes depressed. Marge, pitying for Homer, decides to help and hires him a life coach named Colby Kraus (Stephen Colbert), who will help with Homer's dream. Colby starts right away in his treatment with Homer by videotaping <b>his</b> <b>every</b> <b>move.</b> At the bowling alley and after watching Homer's daily habits for a few days, Colby realizes that bowling is the one thing Homer is good at and enjoys doing. He instructs Homer to wear his bowling shoes everywhere he goes to help instill confidence in everything he does. The bowling shoes work, Homer becomes a new man, and as a result he receives numerous new job offers. Homer decides to only go for an interview at Handyman's Choice Copper Tubing because he would be required to fly in the company jet as part of his new job, however, the Rich Texan does not hire him.|$|E

25|$|Born August 26, 1990 {{and named}} after his hated father {{who left the}} family, Tory is an asocial self-proclaimed genius with a {{photographic}} memory, adept at playing arcade games. So unchallenged by academics that he resorts to other means of exhausting his energy, he is overly obsessive when something or someone catches his interest, and keeps tabs on every event he deems significant in his life, recording the exact time (down to the minute or second) and place in which they occur.

25|$|In the video, Norwood {{plays an}} all-seeing, all-knowing narrator, who gives the central male {{character}} pause with her wicked glances that {{let him know}} she's watching <b>his</b> <b>every</b> <b>move.</b> The pursuit starts with the singer performing the first lines of her song {{in the back of}} a cruising bus, while observing her boarding man next to a female, both discussing vehemently with each other. She's constantly moving and dancing, before the scene shifts to a scaffolding in front of a fenced building, where she performs the chorus in dusty backgrounds. The next scene shows her standing under a traffic light at a plied crossing, wearing a grey outfit and big glasses, wherefrom she enters a near barber shop and performs afresh in a hairdresser chair. At the same time the camera shows her man flirting with two girls. The video ends with a backflash on all locations Norwood was seen at, also catching the daytime in front of the sinking sun.|$|E
500|$|In 1977 Le Mesurier portrayed Jacob Marley in a BBC {{television}} {{adaptation of}} A Christmas Carol, which starred Michael Hordern as Ebenezer Scrooge; Sergio Angelini, {{writing for the}} British Film Institute about Le Mesurier's portrayal, considered that [...] "although never frightening, he does exert {{a strong sense of}} melancholy, <b>his</b> <b>every</b> <b>move</b> and inflection seemingly tinged with regret and remorse". In 1979 he portrayed Sir Gawain in Walt Disney's Unidentified Flying Oddball, directed by Russ Mayberry, and co-starring Dennis Dugan, Jim Dale and Kenneth More. The film, an adaptation of Mark Twain's novel A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court, was hailed by Time Out as [...] "an intelligent film with a cohesive plot and an amusing script" [...] and cited it as [...] "one of the better Disney attempts to hop on the sci-fi bandwagon". The reviewers praised the cast, particularly Kenneth More's Arthur and Le Mesurier's Gawain, which they said were [...] "rather touchingly portrayed as friends who have grown old together".|$|E

Under this time control each player has twelve seconds added to <b>his</b> clock after <b>every</b> <b>move,</b> starting from the first move, regardless of how much time he spends on each move. Thus if a player thinks for eight seconds before making his first move, he will have five minutes and four seconds on his clock after making it.|$|R

500|$|Murphy {{received}} orders on 8 June 1945, {{to report}} to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas. At a 13 June San Antonio homecoming parade held for returning Texas veterans, {{a quarter of a}} million people cheered Murphy, Charles P. Cabell, Lucian Truscott, Harold L. Clark and others. He was then assigned to the Army Ground & Services Redistribution Station at the base and given 30 days leave. Murphy was the home grown hero, and on a visit to Dallas, the media followed <b>his</b> <b>every</b> <b>move,</b> interviewing and photographing him. Farmersville pulled out all the stops, giving him an escort caravan, and five thousand local citizens showed up to hear a band concert and speeches in his honor. He was the star attraction at the 2 to 4 July McKinney rodeo where he opened the event every night. The 16 July issue of Life magazine brought Murphy national attention when its cover story proclaimed him [...] "most decorated" [...] next to a smiling image of him in full dress uniform. Photographers for the magazine followed him to a birthday party in his honor, to his first civilian haircut since 1942, and around to visit friends and relatives.|$|E
500|$|In 1973, Sinatra {{came out}} of his {{short-lived}} retirement with a television special and album. The album, entitled Ol' Blue Eyes Is Back, arranged by Gordon Jenkins and Don Costa, was a success, reaching number 13 on Billboard and number 12 in the UK. The television special, Magnavox Presents Frank Sinatra, reunited Sinatra with Gene Kelly. He initially developed problems with his vocal cords during the comeback due to a prolonged period without singing. That Christmas he performed at the Sahara Hotel in Las Vegas, and returned to Caesars Palace the following month in January 1974, despite previously vowing to perform there again [...] He began what Barbara Sinatra describes as a [...] "massive comeback tour of the United States, Europe, the Far East and Australia". In July, while on a second tour of Australia, he caused an uproar by describing journalists there– who were aggressively pursuing <b>his</b> <b>every</b> <b>move</b> and pushing for a press conference– as [...] "bums, parasites, fags, and buck-and-a-half hookers". After he was pressured to apologize, Sinatra instead insisted that the journalists apologize for [...] "fifteen years of abuse I have taken from the world press". In the end, Sinatra's lawyer, Mickey Rudin, arranged a final concert which was televised to the nation, and Sinatra was given the opportunity to say [...] "I love your attitude, I love your booze" [...] to the Australian people. In October 1974 he appeared at New York City's Madison Square Garden in a televised concert that was later released as an album under the title The Main Event– Live. Backing him was bandleader Woody Herman and the Young Thundering Herd, who accompanied Sinatra on a European tour later that month.|$|E
500|$|According to MTV News, {{the song}} [...] "touches on Drake {{reaction}} to fame and stardom". Drake told MTV News, that {{the song was}} [...] "definitely" [...] a choice of his for releasing as a single, {{and that it was}} a song he did for himself. [...] Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly called the song, [...] "a prideful track about a guy who fought for notoriety, gained it, and now struggles with what comes with it: criticism, groupies, and the pressure of expected greatness." [...] The song makes heavy use of an orchestral backdrop, while Drake delivers confident, aggressive raps in a paced fashion. Drake makes references to film critics Roger Ebert & Richard Roeper, as well as actress Jada Pinkett Smith and her 1996 film, Set It Off. According to Michael Craggg of MusicOMH, the song contains three hooks. Several lines in the second verse are actually a flip of hip-hop group Dead Prez's [...] "Hip-Hop", from their 2000 debut, Let's Get Free. Ironically, Dead Prez's track is meant as a jab at media controlled artists like Drake, stating, [...] "One thing about music when it hits you feel no pain/ White folks say it controls your brain/ I know better than that/ It's just game", to which Drake stated when asked about it, [...] "I love that flow. So I took that flow and flipped it in the second verse." [...] He also references Michael Jackson's iconic attire in his [...] "Thriller" [...] video, though the lines, [...] "'Bout to go 'Thriller' Mike Jackson on these niggas/ All I need is a fucking red jacket with some zippers." [...] On the reference, Drake said, [...] "That was sort of my reference point; that phenomenon of Michael. He was young and had the world excited and anticipating <b>his</b> <b>every</b> <b>move.</b> That was my homage to him and the impact that he had on the world that I live in. It's also ... great for people to say. Especially, unfortunately what happened to him, just to honor him was great." ...|$|E

50|$|One {{of the few}} {{examples}} of combat reports, dated 11 July 1943, seems to contradict Minguzzi's statement, when together with other Italian fighters, Eugenio Salvi's Re.2005 fought against Spitfires over Sicily. A Spitfire Mk V latched onto the tail of Salvi's Re.2005. Salvi tried all the tricks he knew: dives, tight turns, climbs, but the Spitfire remained steadily attached to <b>his</b> tail following <b>every</b> <b>move,</b> and then opened fire. Salvi's Re.2005 was struck by many bullets, and Salvi {{was sure he was}} going to be killed when the Spitfire just as suddenly vanished, possibly out of ammunition.

5000|$|Tillman {{constantly}} baffled <b>his</b> enemies. <b>Every</b> <b>move</b> he made seemed {{sure to be}} counterproductive; yet {{his popularity}} only grew ... he abused his followers, calling them ignorant, imbecilic, backward, apathetic, and foolish. He assailed his enemies with a tongue so outrageous that many believed only {{the demise of the}} code duello kept him alive ... Despite all this, his movement grew and multiplied, thriving best when the issues appeared contrived, contradictory or without foundation. Tillman spoke widely in the state in 1885 and after, and soon attracted allies, including a number of Red Shirt comrades, such as Martin Gary's nephews Eugene B. Gary and John Gary Evans. He sought to mold local farmers' groups into a statewide organization to be a voice for agriculturalists. In April 1886, a convention called by Tillman met in Columbia, the state capital. The goal of {{what became known as the}} Farmer's Association or Farmer's Movement was to control the state Democratic Party from within, and to gain reforms such as the agricultural college. He initially was unsuccessful, though he came within thirty votes of controlling the 1886 state Democratic convention. The lack of success caused Tillman, in late 1887, to announce his retirement from politics, though there was widespread speculation he would soon be back.|$|R
2500|$|Konstantin's {{spirit of}} reform {{had to confront}} an overstaffed {{bureaucracy}} which obstructed <b>his</b> <b>every</b> <b>move.</b> [...] "I want shipwrights and sailors, no crowds of clerks [...] ", he said.

[...] As he pushed forward {{his plans for the}} navy, he was involved in the reform of the naval and military colleges, as well as a thorough investigation of corruption in the army and the revision of the country's censorship laws. Abrupt, quick-tempered, and utterly contemptuous of anyone who opposed him, he could forge through problems that daunted his more sensitive elder brother.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to previous seasons following an Australian tour, Hobbs was extremely successful in 1925. Early in the season, Hobbs scored three consecutive centuries at the Oval {{and the press}} began to speculate that he may soon pass the record of 126 first-class centuries held by Grace. He continued to score a string of hundreds in away matches and by mid-June had become the first man in the season to reach 1,000 first-class runs. Against Cambridge University, Hobbs hit centuries in both innings, and followed with centuries in his next two innings to give him four in succession. Hobbs played with great freedom during this spell, and after a brief lull in his run-scoring, hit 140 in the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's, playing a range of shots. His 12th century of the season, against Kent on 20 July, took him to 125 first-class centuries and one short of Grace's record. By now, the press and public were eagerly following Hobbs' progress in the expectation he would break the record, and great publicity surrounded <b>his</b> <b>every</b> <b>move.</b> Amid the pressure, and as fatigue set in, Hobbs lost form. Although he continued to make substantial scores, he could not reach a century; after one innings of 54, a newspaper headline proclaimed that [...] "Hobbs Fails Again".|$|E
2500|$|Wilson is infamously {{difficult}} to interview, rarely ever giving a long answer. According to Salon writer Peter Gilstrap: [...] "He’s also {{been known to}} get up, extend a hand and blurt out 'Thanks!' well before the allotted time is up. And sometimes he just gets tired and shuts down. None of this, however, {{is due to a}} bad attitude." [...] He admits to having a poor memory, and in interviews, occasionally lies to [...] "test" [...] people. David Oppenheim, who interviewed Wilson in 1966, remembers that [...] "we tried to talk with him but didn't get much out of him. Some guy said 'He's not verbal.' He was odd and he seemed odder." [...] In 2017, the Charlotte Observers Theodon Janes surmised that while Wilson's past struggles with mental illness are widely documented, he still [...] "is faring well enough to write a book ... and to headline [...] hugely ambitious concert tour, so presumably he’s capable of telling people who work for him that he's not up for interviews, if he isn't." [...] When asked about negative comments written in the book, Love responded: [...] "He’s not in charge of his life, like I am mine. <b>His</b> <b>every</b> <b>move</b> is orchestrated and a lot of things he's purported to say, there’s not tape of it. But, I don’t like to put undue pressure on him, either, because I know {{he has a lot of}} issues. Out of compassion, I don't respond to everything that is purportedly said by him." ...|$|E

[...] said Lord Wen-hui. [...] "Imagine skill reaching such heights!"Cook Ting laid down his knife and replied, [...] "What I care about is the Way, which goes beyond skill. When I first began cutting up oxen, all I could see was the ox itself. After three years I no longer saw the whole ox. And now I go at it by spirit and don't look with my eyes. Perception and understanding have come to a stop and spirit moves where it wants. I go along with the natural makeup, strike in the big hollows, guide the knife through the big openings, and follow things as they are. So I never touch the smallest ligament or tendon, much less a main joint.""A good cook changes his knife once a year, because he cuts. A mediocre cook changes his knife once a month, because he hacks. I've had this knife of mine for nineteen years and I've cut up thousands of oxen with it, and yet the blade is as good as though it had just come from the grindstone. There are spaces between the joints, and the blade of the knife has really no thickness. If you insert what has no thickness into such spaces, then there's plenty of room, more than enough for the blade to play about it. That's why after nineteen years the blade of my knife is still as good as when it first came from the grindstone. Chapter 3 - The Secret of Caring for Life ...|$|R
