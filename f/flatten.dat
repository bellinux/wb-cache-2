Immanuel Kant, familiar with Swedenborg's work, developed the theory further in 1755, publishing his own Universal Natural History and Theory of the Heavens, wherein he argued that gaseous clouds (nebulae) slowly rotate, gradually collapse and <b>flatten</b> due to gravity, eventually forming stars and planets.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Compiling a solver-independent {{constraint}} {{model to}} solver input usually involves <b>flattening,</b> the decomposition of complex constraints into simpler expressions {{to suit the}} solver, introducing additional variables and constraints. In previous work [8], we have proposed extending <b>flattening</b> with common subexpression elimination (CSE) which can reduce the overhead introduced during <b>flattening.</b> In this work, we formally analyse the cost of standard <b>flattening</b> and CSEbased flattening: we compare time and space complexity and investigate the potential variable and constraint reduction from CSE-based <b>flattening,</b> its scope and limitations. Furthermore, we discuss <b>flattening</b> whole problem classes and show how to integrate CSE into class-wise <b>flattening.</b> We highlight the differences to instance-wise <b>flattening</b> and discuss open questions. Finally, our empirical analysis confirms our theoretical findings and demonstrates the benefits of CSE-based <b>flattening.</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to <b>flatten</b> into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense protostar (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E
5|$|Some systems use {{parametric}} equalization in {{an attempt}} to correct for room frequency response irregularities. Equalization is often unable to achieve flat frequency response at all listening locations {{in part because of the}} resonance (i.e., standing wave) patterns at low frequencies in nearly all rooms. Careful positioning of the subwoofer within the room can also help <b>flatten</b> the frequency response. Multiple subwoofers can manage a flatter general response since they can often be arranged to excite room modes more evenly than a single subwoofer, allowing equalization to be more effective.|$|E
5|$|Thayer's {{original}} argument, restated by Cott, {{was that}} nature did {{the exact opposite}} with countershading that an artist did with paint when creating the illusion of solid three-dimensionality, namely counteracting the effect of shade to <b>flatten</b> out form. Shading is a powerful cue used by animals in different phyla to identify the shapes of objects. Research with chicks showed that they preferred to peck at grains with shadows falling below them (as if illuminated from above), so both humans and birds may make use of shading as a depth cue.|$|E

40|$|A {{simple and}} direct method of calculating the post-buckle <b>flattening</b> strain of folds is proposed. Assuming that the folds have Class 1 B (parallel) shape before <b>flattening,</b> {{the stretch of}} the layer at any {{position}} in the <b>flattened</b> fold is inversely proportional to the orthogonal thickness of the layer.

5|$|The {{cervical}} canal is {{a passage}} through which sperm must travel to fertilize an egg cell after sexual intercourse. Several methods of contraception, including cervical caps and cervical diaphragms aim to block or prevent {{the passage of}} sperm through the cervical canal. Cervical mucus is used in several methods of fertility awareness, such as the Creighton model and Billings method, due to its changes in consistency throughout the menstrual period. During vaginal childbirth, the cervix must <b>flatten</b> and dilate to allow the fetus to progress along the birth canal. Midwives and doctors use {{the extent of the}} dilation of the cervix to assist decision-making during childbirth.|$|E

The development team found it particularly difficult to render Lisa's spiky hair as 2D in the game's 3D environment. The Wii version has lower-quality graphics than the Xbox 360 and PS3 versions due to the console's inferior hardware. There is a different cover for the game on each console.|$|E
5|$|The {{outermost}} {{layer of}} the body has no cuticle but consists of a ciliated and glandular epithelium containing rhabdites, which form the mucus in which the cilia glide. Each ciliated cell has many cilia and microvilli. The outermost layer rests on a thickened basement membrane, the dermis. Next to the dermis {{are at least three}} layers of muscles, some circular and some longitudinal. The combinations of muscle types vary between the different classes, but these are not associated with differences in movement. Nemerteans also have dorso-ventral muscles, which <b>flatten</b> the animals, especially in the larger species. Inside the concentric tubes of these layers is mesenchyme, a kind of connective tissue. In pelagic species this tissue is gelatinous and buoyant.|$|E

5|$|Visual {{displays}} mostly {{occur in}} agonistic situations. Elephants {{will try to}} appear more threatening by raising their heads and spreading their ears. They may add to the display by shaking their heads and snapping their ears, as well as throwing dust and vegetation. They are usually bluffing when performing these actions. Excited elephants may raise their trunks. Submissive ones will lower their heads and trunks, as well as <b>flatten</b> their ears against their necks, while those that accept a challenge will position their ears in a V shape.|$|E
5|$|Yardley {{decided to}} use the medium roller to <b>flatten</b> out the surface, but further showers breathed more life into the pitch, forcing a rain break {{immediately}} after the start of England's run chase. The rain immediately stopped after the players returned to the pavilion, but upon promptly returning to the middle, the rain started again. The players returned after 15 minutes and played for approximately half an hour, before Washbrook and Hutton unsuccessfully appealed against the light. Rain then came again for another 40 minutes, which included the tea break. The weather cleared in time for the normal resumption of play at 4:30 after the scheduled adjournment.|$|E
5|$|A {{stratocumulus}} cloud {{is another}} type of a cumuliform or stratocumuliform cloud. Like cumulus clouds, they form at low levels and via convection. However, unlike cumulus clouds, their growth is almost completely retarded by a strong inversion. As a result, they <b>flatten</b> out like stratus clouds, giving them a layered appearance. These clouds are extremely common, covering on average around twenty-three percent of the earth's oceans and twelve percent of the earth's continents. They are less common in tropical areas and commonly form after cold fronts. Additionally, stratocumulus clouds reflect {{a large amount of}} the incoming sunlight, producing a net cooling effect. Stratocumulus clouds can produce drizzle, which stabilizes the cloud by warming it and reducing turbulent mixing. Being a cloud of limited convection, stratocumulus is divided into three species; stratiformis, lenticularis, and castellanus, that are common to the higher stratocumuliform genus-types.|$|E
50|$|Phyllolepida ("leaf scales") is an extinct taxon of <b>flattened</b> placoderms found {{throughout}} the world, with fossils being found in Devonian strata.

25|$|In melody, blues is {{distinguished}} {{by the use}} of the <b>flattened</b> third, fifth and seventh of the associated major scale. These specialized notes are called the blue or bent notes. These scale tones may replace the natural scale tones, or they may be added to the scale, {{as in the case of}} the minor blues scale, in which the <b>flattened</b> third replaces the natural third, the <b>flattened</b> seventh replaces the natural seventh and the <b>flattened</b> fifth is added between the natural fourth and natural fifth. While the 12-bar harmonic progression had been intermittently used for centuries, the revolutionary aspect of blues was the frequent use of the <b>flattened</b> third, <b>flattened</b> seventh, and even <b>flattened</b> fifth in the melody, together with crushing—playing directly adjacent notes at the same time (i.e., minor second)—and sliding, similar to using grace notes. The blue notes allow for key moments of expression during the cadences, melodies, and embellishments of the blues.|$|R
5|$|Mantas {{move through}} the water by the wing-like {{movements}} of their pectoral fins, which drive water backwards. Their large mouths are rectangular, and face forward as opposed to other ray and skate species with downward-facing mouths. The spiracles typical of rays are vestigial, and mantas must swim continuously to keep oxygenated water passing over their gills. The cephalic fins are usually spiralled, but <b>flatten</b> during foraging. The fish's gill arches have pallets of pinkish-brown spongy tissue that collect food particles. Mantas track down prey using visual and olfactory senses. They {{have one of the}} highest brain-to-body mass ratios and the largest brain size of all fish. Their brains have retia mirabilia which may serve to keep them warm. M. alfredi has been shown to dive to depths of over 400 m, while their relative Mobula tarapacana, which has a similar structure, dives to nearly 2000 m; the retia mirabilia probably serve to prevent their brains from being chilled during such dives into colder subsurface waters.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1785, the {{government}} had taken possession of Southsea Common, the marshland surrounding the castle, to ensure it remained open and accessible to the fort's guns, and convicts were deployed to fill in and <b>flatten</b> out the marshes from 1831 onwards. The surrounding area began to develop as an urban centre; seaside facilities were established {{at the start of}} the century and in the 1840s new private housing was built around the edge of the common, used by military and naval officers. The construction of a railway line from London enabled the settlement of Southsea, named after the castle, to turn into a prosperous resort. Southsea Common was leased by the local government in 1884 and, as the population grew, practising firing the castle's guns became more difficult.|$|E
5|$|Most {{octopuses}} swim by expelling a jet {{of water}} from the mantle through the siphon into the sea. The physical principle behind this is that the force required to accelerate the water through the orifice produces a reaction that propels the octopus in the opposite direction. The direction of travel depends on the orientation of the siphon. When swimming, the head is at the front and the siphon is pointed backwards, but when jetting, the visceral hump leads, the siphon points towards the head and the arms trail behind, with the animal presenting a fusiform appearance. In an alternative method of swimming, some species <b>flatten</b> themselves dorso-ventrally, and swim with the arms held out sideways, and this may provide lift and be faster than normal swimming. Jetting is used to escape from danger, but is physiologically inefficient, requiring a mantle pressure so high as to stop the heart from beating, resulting in a progressive oxygen deficit.|$|E
40|$|Most {{programming}} languages {{support a}} call stack in the programming model {{and also in}} the runtime system. We show that for applications targeting low-power embedded microcontrollers (MCUs), RAM usage can be significantly decreased by partially or completely eliminating the runtime callstack. We present <b>flattening,</b> a transformation that absorbs a function into its caller, replacing function invocations and returns with jumps. Unlike inlining, <b>flattening</b> does not duplicate the bodies of functions that have multiple callsites. Applied aggressively, <b>flattening</b> results in stack elimination. <b>Flattening</b> is most useful in conjunction with a lifting transformation that moves global variables into a local scope. <b>Flattening</b> and lifting can save RAM. However, even more benefit can be obtained by adapting the compiler to cope with properties of <b>flattened</b> code. First, we show that <b>flattening</b> adds false paths that confuse a standard live variables analysis. The resulting problems can be mitigated by breaking spurious live-range conflicts between variables using information from the unflattened callgraph. Second, we show that the impact of high register pressure due to <b>flattened</b> and lifted code, and consequent spills out of the register allocator, can be mitigated by improving a compiler’s stack layout optimizations. We have implemented both of these improvements in GCC, and have implemented <b>flattening</b> and lifting as source-tosource transformations. On a collection of applications for the AVR family of 8 -bit MCUs, we show that total RAM usage can be reduced by 20 % by compiling <b>flattened</b> and lifted programs with our improved GCC...|$|R

In our case, the property “id” is <b>flattened</b> by using rule “rule-trf-prop-flatten-types”, and the “landekode” (country code in English) which is defined as “gmd:Country_PropertyType” is <b>flattened</b> by using rule “rule-trf-prop-flatten-codelists” to a string type.|$|R

5|$|Jump {{distance}} is measured {{from the edge}} of the table to the placement of landing by increments of 0.5m. This is done using electronic and video monitoring systems together with event personnel assigned to observe jumps by the side of the hill, known as 'distance measurers'. If enough jumps are deemed to be too far beyond the hill size, or near the 'fall line' as determined by the jury – the zone where the slope begins to <b>flatten</b> out – an immediate meeting is held between the jury and race director, which usually results in the start gate being lowered so as to check inrun speeds and therefore distances. For spectators and judges, increments of 5m are clearly indicated by rows of fir across the hill; a painted red line is used for the K-point, and a dashed red line for the hill size. Both sides of the hill are also marked highly visible in red to indicate the 'landing zone', while the point beyond the hill size is marked in green on the sides.|$|E
5|$|The Solar System formed 4.568 {{billion years}} ago from the {{gravitational}} collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud. This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the pre-solar nebula, collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to <b>flatten</b> into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200AU and a hot, dense protostar at the centre. The planets formed by accretion from this disc, in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies. Hundreds of protoplanets may have existed in the early Solar System, but they either merged or were destroyed, leaving the planets, dwarf planets, and leftover minor bodies.|$|E
5|$|The {{ultimate}} {{aim is to}} land on, or ideally surpass, a line marked {{across the}} hill called the 'K-point', 'critical point', or 'calculation line'. In order to attain the most points from the style judges, athletes strive for a 'Telemark' landing: instead of landing with simply both feet together (a 'two-footed' landing), one foot is planted clearly {{in front of the}} other (without sliding the skis), both feet held no more than four ski widths' apart, and the body held stable with a straight back and arms outstretched. This pose must be maintained until the 'outrun' – a line at the very end of the hill, where the slope has fully flattened out – is reached. The exact placement of landing is measured between the athlete's front and back feet. Failing to make a Telemark landing results in a loss of style points. Considerably more points are lost if a landing fails before the outrun line, such as falling over or touching the ground with any part of the body except the feet. However, when the hill begins to <b>flatten</b> out, it becomes increasingly difficult to make a Telemark landing.|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of Duysens <b>flattening</b> of the absorption spectra {{resulting from the}} inhomogeneous distribution of the chromophores in the solution is analyzed. These inhomogeneities are treated as localized statistical fluctuations in the concentration of the absorbing species, by using the Gaussian distribution. A law of absorbance is obtained, {{and the effect of}} light scattering on the <b>flattening</b> is also characterized. The <b>flattening</b> in the circular dichroism spectra of particulate suspensions is then analyzed. It is shown that the degree of <b>flattening</b> of the circular dichroism of a suspension is, in general, different from the corresponding <b>flattening</b> of its absorption spectrum. A quantitative relationship between the two effects is established...|$|R
30|$|Roll <b>flattening</b> is an {{important}} component in the roll stack elastic deformation, which has important influence on controlling of the strip crown and flatness. Foppl formula and semi-infinite body model are the most popular analytical models in the roll <b>flattening</b> calculation. However, the roll <b>flattening</b> calculated by traditional <b>flattening</b> models has a great deviation from actual situation, especially near the barrel edges. Therefore, in order to improve the accuracy of roll <b>flattening,</b> a new model is proposed based on the elastic half plane theory. The calculation formulas of roll <b>flattening</b> are deduced respectively under the assumptions of plane strain and plane stress. Then, the two assumptions are combined through the method of introducing an transition coefficient, and the distribution rules of roll <b>flattening</b> for different rolling force, <b>flattening</b> width, roll length and roll diameter are analyzed by using the FEM analysis software Marc. Regarding the ratio of the length to roll end and the roll diameter as variable to fit the transition coefficient, the new model of roll <b>flattening</b> is established based on the elastic half plane theory. Finally, the transition coefficient is fitted to establish the model. Compared with the traditional models, the new model can effectively improve the calculation deviation in the roll end, which has important significance for accurate simulation of plate shape, especially for the distribution of rolling force between rolls.|$|R
