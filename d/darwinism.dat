5|$|Beddard's Animal Coloration {{is cited}} and {{discussed}} both by historians of science, and by practising scientists {{from a number}} of different fields. For example, the book illuminates the progress of <b>Darwinism,</b> camouflage research, sexual selection, mimicry and the debate on the purpose of animal coloration triggered by Abbott Thayer. These areas are described in turn below.|$|E
5|$|Modern {{evaluation}} {{of the book is}} from a variety of perspectives, including the history of <b>Darwinism,</b> the history of the Thayer debate on the purpose of camouflage, the mechanisms of camouflage, sexual selection, and mimicry. Beddard is seen as having covered a wide swath of modern biology with both theory and experiment.|$|E
5|$|On Growth and Form {{explained}} in detail why he believed <b>Darwinism</b> {{to be an}} inadequate explanation for the origin of new species. He did not openly reject natural selection, but regarded it as secondary to the origin of biological form. Instead, he advocated structuralism {{as an alternative to}} natural selection in governing the form of species, with a hint that vitalism was the unseen driving force.|$|E
5|$|However, in the 1920s Christian fundamentalists in the United States {{developed}} their literalist arguments against modernist theology into {{opposition to the}} teaching of evolution, with fears that <b>Darwinism</b> had led to German militarism and was a threat to religion and morality. This opposition developed into the creation–evolution controversy involving Christian literalists in the United States objecting {{to the teaching of}} evolution in public schools. Although early objectors dismissed evolution as contradicting their interpretation of the Bible, this argument was legally invalidated when the Supreme Court ruled in Epperson v. Arkansas in 1968 that forbidding the teaching of evolution on religious grounds violated the Establishment Clause.|$|E
5|$|Hugo de Vries {{tried to}} link the new {{genetics}} with evolution; building on his work with heredity and hybridization, he proposed a theory of mutationism, which was widely accepted in the early 20th century. Lamarckism also had many adherents. <b>Darwinism</b> was seen as incompatible with the continuously variable traits studied by biometricians, which seemed only partially heritable. In the 1920s and 1930s—following {{the acceptance of the}} Mendelian-chromosome theory— the emergence of the discipline of population genetics, with the work of R.A. Fisher, J.B.S. Haldane and Sewall Wright, unified the idea of evolution by natural selection with Mendelian genetics, producing the modern synthesis. The inheritance of acquired characters was rejected, while mutationism gave way as genetic theories matured.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of {{acceptance}} from major religious hierarchies, early religious objections to Darwin's theory are still used {{in opposition to}} evolution. The ideas that species change over time through natural processes and that different species share common ancestors seemed to contradict the Genesis account of Creation. Believers in Biblical infallibility attacked <b>Darwinism</b> as heretical. The natural theology of the early 19th century was typified by William Paley's watchmaker analogy, an argument from design still used by the creationist movement. Natural theology included a range of ideas and arguments from the outset, and when Darwin's theory was published, ideas of theistic evolution were presented in which evolution is accepted as a secondary cause open to scientific investigation, while still holding belief in God as a first cause with a non-specified role in guiding evolution and creating humans. This position has been adopted by denominations of Christianity and Judaism in line with modernist theology which views the Bible and Torah as allegorical, thus removing the conflict between evolution and religion.|$|E
5|$|The {{application}} of sociobiology to humans (discussed {{only in the}} first and last chapters of the book) was immediately controversial. Some researchers, led by Stephen Jay Gould and Richard Lewontin, contended that sociobiology embodied biological determinism. They argued that it would be used, as similar ideas had been in the past, to justify the status quo, entrench ruling elites, and legitimize authoritarian political programmes. They referred to social <b>Darwinism</b> and eugenics of the early 20th century, and other more recent developments, such as the IQ controversy of the early 1970s, as cautionary tales in the use of evolutionary principles as applied to human society. They believed that Wilson was committing the naturalistic fallacy, attempting to define moral principles using natural concepts. Academics opposed to Wilson's sociobiology, including Gould, Lewontin, Jon Beckwith, Ruth Hubbard, and Anthony Leeds created the Sociobiology Study Group of Science for the People to counter his ideas.|$|E
5|$|The {{historian}} Robinson M. Yost {{explains that}} <b>Darwinism</b> went into eclipse during the 1890s. At that time, most zoologists felt that natural selection {{could not be}} {{the main cause of}} biological adaptation, and sought alternative explanations. As a result, many zoologists rejected both Batesian mimicry and Müllerian mimicry. Beddard, writes Yost, explained some problems in the theory of mimicry including that, given how many insect species there are, resemblances between species could arise by chance, and that mimicry was sometimes either useless or actually harmful. In Yost's view, Beddard wanted more evidence that natural selection really was responsible. Yost cites the staunch Darwinist Poulton's hostile review of 1892, which asserts the pre-eminence of Darwin's theory. But, writes Yost, Beddard was not alone in being wary of natural selection.|$|E
5|$|In 1889, Wallace {{wrote the}} book <b>Darwinism,</b> which {{explained}} and defended natural selection. In it, he proposed the hypothesis that natural selection could drive the reproductive isolation of two varieties by encouraging the development of barriers against hybridisation. Thus it might {{contribute to the development}} of new species. He suggested the following scenario. When two populations of a species had diverged beyond a certain point, each adapted to particular conditions, hybrid offspring would be less well-adapted than either parent form and, at that point, natural selection will tend to eliminate the hybrids. Furthermore, under such conditions, natural selection would favour the development of barriers to hybridisation, as individuals that avoided hybrid matings would tend to have more fit offspring, and thus contribute to the reproductive isolation of the two incipient species. This idea came to be known as the Wallace effect, later referred to as reinforcement. Wallace had suggested to Darwin that natural selection could play a role in preventing hybridisation in private correspondence as early as 1868, but had not worked it out to this level of detail. It continues to be a topic of research in evolutionary biology today, with both computer simulation and empirical results supporting its validity.|$|E
5|$|The book aroused {{international}} interest and a widespread debate, with no sharp line between scientific issues and ideological, social and religious implications. Much {{of the initial}} reaction was hostile, in a large part because very few reviewers actually understood his theory, but Darwin {{had to be taken}} seriously as a prominent and respected name in science. There was much less controversy than had greeted the 1844 publication Vestiges of Creation, which had been rejected by scientists, but had influenced a wide public readership into believing that nature and human society were governed by natural laws. The Origin of Species as a book of wide general interest became associated with ideas of social reform. Its proponents made full use of a surge in the publication of review journals, and it was given more popular attention than almost any other scientific work, though it failed to match the continuing sales of Vestiges. Darwin's book legitimised scientific discussion of evolutionary mechanisms, and the newly coined term <b>Darwinism</b> was used to cover the whole range of evolutionism, not just his own ideas. By the mid-1870s, evolutionism was triumphant.|$|E
5|$|The {{contemporary}} {{discipline of}} sociology is theoretically multi-paradigmatic {{as a result}} of the contentions of classical social theory. In Randall Collins' well-cited survey of sociological theory he retroactively labels various theorists as belonging to four theoretical traditions: Functionalism, Conflict, Symbolic Interactionism, and Utilitarianism. Modern sociological theory descends predominately from functionalist (Durkheim) and conflict-centred (Marx and Weber) accounts of social structure, as well as the symbolic interactionist tradition consisting of micro-scale structural (Simmel) and pragmatist (Mead, Cooley) theories of social interaction. Utilitarianism, also known as Rational Choice or Social Exchange, although often associated with economics, is an established tradition within sociological theory. Lastly, as argued by Raewyn Connell, a tradition that is often forgotten is that of Social <b>Darwinism,</b> which brings the logic of Darwinian biological evolution and applies it to people and societies. This tradition often aligns with classical functionalism. It was the dominant theoretical stance in American sociology from around 1881 to 1915 and is associated with several founders of sociology, primarily Herbert Spencer, Lester F. Ward and William Graham Sumner. Contemporary sociological theory retains traces of each of these traditions and they are by no means mutually exclusive.|$|E
25|$|In 1874, Hodge {{published}} What is <b>Darwinism?,</b> {{claiming that}} <b>Darwinism,</b> was, in essence, atheism. To Hodge, <b>Darwinism</b> was {{contrary to the}} notion of design and was therefore clearly atheistic. Both in the Review and in What is <b>Darwinism?,</b> (1874) Hodge attacked <b>Darwinism.</b> His views determined the position of the Seminary until his death in 1878. While he didn't consider all evolutionary ideas to be in conflict with his religion, he was concerned with its teaching in colleges. Meanwhile, at Princeton University, a totally separate institution, President John Maclean also rejected Darwin's theory of evolution. However, in 1868, upon Maclean's retirement, James McCosh, a philosopher, became president. McCosh believed that much of <b>Darwinism</b> could and would be proved sound, and so he strove to prepare Christians for this event. Instead of conflict between science and religion, McCosh sought reconciliation. Insisting on the principle of design in nature, McCosh interpreted the Darwinian discoveries as more evidence of the prearrangement, skill, and purpose in the universe. He thus argued that <b>Darwinism</b> was not atheistic nor in irreconcilable hostility to the Bible. The Presbyterians in America thus could choose between two schools of thought on evolution, both based in Princeton. The Seminary held to Hodge's position until his supporters were ousted in 1929, and the college (Princeton University) became a world class center of the new science of evolutionary biology.|$|E

25|$|Bryan opposed Charles Darwin's {{theory of}} {{evolution}} through natural selection for two reasons. First, he believed that what he considered a materialistic account of the descent of man (and all life) through evolution was directly contrary to the Biblical creation account, which he accepted. Second, he considered <b>Darwinism</b> as applied to society (social <b>Darwinism)</b> {{to be a great}} evil force in the world, promoting hatred and conflicts, especially the World War, and inhibiting upward social and economic mobility of the poor and oppressed.|$|E

25|$|Stebbing wrote {{a number}} of essays {{on the topic of}} <b>Darwinism,</b> in which he {{dissected}} the argument posited against it, and questioned various aspects of Christianity, including the literal truth of the Book of Genesis, the doctrine of the Trinity, the divinity of Jesus, many of the Thirty-Nine Articles, miracles and prophecy. They included Essays on <b>Darwinism</b> (1871), Faith in Fetters (1919) and Plain Speaking (1926). His outspoken stance resulted in his being banned from preaching, and he was never offered a parish by the church.|$|E
25|$|The novel also dramatises {{the ideas}} of race {{presented}} in Social <b>Darwinism,</b> in that the Martians exercise over humans their 'rights' as a superior race, more advanced in evolution.|$|E
25|$|Some {{contemporary}} Orthodox Jews {{writers are}} concerned that if evolution is accepted as true, then {{it could lead to}} the Torah being deemed not only irrelevant but also false. Rabbi Dovid Gottlieb has argued that for Jews accepting evolution is equivalent to accepting atheism. The Israeli microbiologist Morris Goldman has written that <b>Darwinism</b> is a problem for Judaism, since <b>Darwinism</b> makes god irrelevant. Other issues are that evolution can provide a non religious basis for the development of morality, and it removes the idea that humans are qualitatively different from other animals.|$|E
