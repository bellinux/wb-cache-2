Lisa replies that 10% of $120 million is actually $12 million. The hospital's public address system announces a code blue, signifying that Homer has entered cardiac arrest.|$|E
25|$|Clothing, {{hair and}} other styles <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> part of hip hop's social and {{cultural}} impact since the 1970s. Although the styles have changed over the decades, distinctive urban apparel and looks have been an important way for rappers, breakdancers and other hip hop community members to express themselves. As the hip hop music genre's popularity increased, so did the effect of its fashion. While there were early items synonymous with hip hop that crossed over into the mainstream culture, like Run-DMC's affinity for Adidas or the Wu-Tang Clan's championing of Clarks’ Wallabees, it wasn’t until its commercial peak that hip hop fashion became influential. Starting in the mid- to late 1990s, hip hop culture embraced some major designers and established a new connection with classic fashion. Brands such as Ralph Lauren, Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger all tapped into hip hop culture and gave very little in return. Moving into the new millennium, hip hop fashion consisted of baggy shirts, jeans, and jerseys. As names like Pharrell and Jay-Z started their own clothing lines and still others like Kanye West linked up with designers like Louis Vuitton, the clothes got tighter, more classically fashionable, and expensive.|$|E

Turn 10 has cited the vehicle's exaggerated four wheel steering system, fictional futuristic technology and excessive height as reasons for its exclusion, stating [...] "One, it's got some technology that's built into Halo that would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> investment for us to then build into the game only to support one vehicle.

[...] Despite this lack of commercial success, the Byrds' rendition of [...] "Goin' Back" [...] featured a band performance that author Ric Menck has described as [...] "a beautiful recording", while music critic Richie Unterberger has called it [...] "a magnificent and melodic cover ... that should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> hit."

Ahsan Haque of IGN rated the episode a 7/10, claiming the episode had entertaining moments, but {{was not one of}} the show's strongest efforts. Haque wrote, [...] "Jesus on Family Guy should <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> deal and featured far more laughs than it did." [...] Steve Heisler of The A.V.

Bozell said [...] "this lying, slacker Jesus is even dumber than Peter, the greatest idiot on animated television today." [...] Tom Eames of entertainment website Digital Spy placed the episode at number nine on his listing of the best Family Guy episodes in order of [...] "yukyukyuks" [...] due its use of the 'Sufin Bird' song and quipped that [...] "you never know when it might strike again." ...|$|E

[...] Clements and Musker pitched {{the idea for the}} film to Walt Disney Animation Studios CEO John Lasseter [...] "as a hand-drawn film with an African American heroine", conceiving Tiana [...] "as someone who would never <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>big</b> fan of Disney fairy tales." [...] The character was inspired by famed restaurateur Leah Chase, who Clements and Musker met on their research trip to New Orleans. Clements elaborated, [...] "There's a woman in New Orleans named Lee (sic) Chase who was a waitress and ultimately opened a restaurant with her husband … we met with her and we talked with her and she went to kind of into her story, her philosophy about food, which is a big element of the movie." ...|$|E
