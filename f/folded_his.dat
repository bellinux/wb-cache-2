5|$|Durant {{was placed}} on the Ottawa Renegades {{negotiation}} list in 2006, by future Saskatchewan Roughriders general manager Eric Tillman. After the Renegades <b>folded,</b> <b>his</b> rights were obtained by the Hamilton Tiger-Cats and later dealt to the Roughriders in a trade that included Corey Holmes. Durant signed with the team on May 11, 2006. During the 2006 season, he served as the team's backup quarterback for eight games, completing a single pass for 14 yards and recording a single rushing attempt for 20 yards in a game against Hamilton. Durant was on the team's practice roster for the remaining ten games.|$|E
5|$|Under {{financial}} pressure, Goldkette <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> premier band in September in New York. Paul Whiteman {{hoped to}} snatch up Goldkette's best musicians for his traveling orchestra, but Beiderbecke, Trumbauer, Murray, Bill Rank, Eddie Lang, Joe Venuti, Chauncey Morehouse, and Frank Signorelli instead joined the bass saxophone player Adrian Rollini at the Club New Yorker. When that job ended sooner than expected, in October 1927, Beiderbecke and Trumbauer {{signed on with}} Whiteman. They joined his orchestra in Indianapolis on October 27.|$|E

25|$|Burr {{moved to}} New York in 1940, {{and made his}} first Broadway {{appearance}} in Crazy With the Heat, a two-act musical revue produced by Kurt Kasznar that quickly <b>folded.</b> <b>His</b> first starring role on the stage came in November 1942, {{when he was an}} emergency replacement in a Pasadena Playhouse production of Quiet Wedding, directed by Lenore Shanewise. He {{became a member of the}} Pasadena Playhouse drama faculty for 18 months, and he performed in some 30 plays over the years. He returned to the Broadway stage for Patrick Hamilton's The Duke in Darkness (1944), a psychological drama set during the French Wars of Religion. Burr's performance as the loyal friend of the imprisoned protagonist led to a contract with RKO Radio Pictures.|$|E
500|$|As the U.S. vice president, Coolidge and his vivacious wife Grace {{were invited}} to quite a few parties, where the legend of [...] "Silent Cal" [...] was born. It is from this time {{that most of the}} jokes and anecdotes {{involving}} Coolidge originate. Although Coolidge was known to be a skilled and effective public speaker, in private {{he was a man of}} few words and was commonly referred to as [...] "Silent Cal". A possibly apocryphal story has it that a matron, seated next to him at a dinner, said to him, [...] "I made a bet today that I could get more than two words out of you." [...] He replied, [...] "You lose." [...] Dorothy Parker, upon learning that Coolidge had died, reportedly remarked, [...] "How can they tell?" [...] Coolidge often seemed uncomfortable among fashionable Washington society; when asked why he continued to attend so many of their dinner parties, he replied, [...] "Got to eat somewhere." [...] Alice Roosevelt Longworth, a leading Republican wit, underscored Coolidge's silence and his dour personality: [...] "When he wished he were elsewhere, he pursed his lips, <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> arms, and said nothing. He looked then precisely as though he had been weaned on a pickle." ...|$|E

After saying this, he reverently <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> hands and praised the great dharma kings, translators, and panditas of the previous centuries." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1939 Scott, seeking greater {{challenges}} {{during the}} swing era, <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> Quintette {{into a big}} band, including bass player Chubby Jackson. They were both a recording and touring success. When Scott was appointed music director of CBS radio in 1942, he made history by breaking the color barrier, organizing the first racially integrated radio band. Over the next two years, he hired some of the hottest black jazz heavyweights of the day, such as saxophonist Ben Webster, trumpeter Charlie Shavers, bassist Billy Taylor, trumpeter Emmett Berry, trombonist Benny Morton, and drummer Cozy Cole. In 1942, Scott—who once told an interviewer he wouldn't hire himself to play piano in his own bands—relinquished his keyboard duties with his bands, so he could focus more closely on hiring, composing, arranging and conducting. (He later returned to the keyboard {{with some of his}} bands.) ...|$|E
2500|$|Although it is {{not clear}} where they {{intended}} to take them, all accounts agree that Standing resisted by turning towards the mob and in a loud voice commanded them to [...] "Surrender." [...] When he made this declaration he was holding a pistol a member of the mob had left unguarded on a nearby tree stump. In response, Standing was immediately shot in forehead [...] "directly above the nose". Another member of the mob then pointed to Clawson and said [...] "Shoot that man." [...] Clawson <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> arms and said [...] "Shoot." [...] Although he appeared calm and maintained composure, he nearly passed out in the anxiety of the moment. For reasons unknown, the same man who moments ago told the mob to shoot Clawson now said [...] "Don’t shoot." [...] As Clawson examined Standing, one man said; [...] "This is terrible; that he should have killed himself in such a manner," [...] claiming that Standing accidentally shot himself [...] "while bringing his weapon into position." ...|$|E
2500|$|At Los Angeles High School, Wieman {{followed}} {{in the footsteps of}} four older brothers, Henry, [...] "Ink," [...] Drury and [...] "Tabby" [...] Wieman. [...] All had been excellent athletes in football, track, baseball and basketball. [...] "Tad" [...] played at [...] "breakaway" [...] in rugby football for Los Angeles High and was heralded as the best athlete in a family regarded as [...] "the greatest athletic one in the history of Southern California athletics." [...] Wieman had been expected to follow his older brothers who had all enrolled at Occidental College, but he broke the family tradition when he decided to attend the University of Michigan. [...] When Wieman announced his decision to attend Michigan, the Los Angeles Times called it [...] "a calamity of almost national importance." [...] The Times reported at length on Wieman's decision, noting:"The fifth of the Wieman tribe has upset the most ancient tradition of Occidental College. [...] The mighty Tad, terror of all Rugbyites last year, while playing for Los Angeles High, last Sunday quietly <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> tent like the Arab and stole away. ... Tad promised to be the greatest of them all. ... What Occidental will do without the great Tad nobody knows." ...|$|E
