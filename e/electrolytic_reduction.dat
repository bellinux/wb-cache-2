40|$|Background: Volatile {{fatty acids}} (VFA) are {{building}} blocks for the chemical industry. Sustainable, biological production is constrained by production and recovery costs, including the need for intensive pH correction. Membrane electrolysis has been developed as an in situ extraction technology tailored to the direct recovery of VFA from fermentation while stabilizing acidogenesis without caustic addition. A current applied across an anion exchange membrane reduces the fermentation broth (catholyte, water reduction: H 2 O + e- â†’ 12 H 2 + OH-) and drives carboxylate ions into a clean, concentrated VFA stream (anolyte, water oxidation: H 2 O â†’ 2 e- + 2 H+ + O 2). Results: In this study, we fermented thin stillage to generate a mixed VFA extract without chemical pH control. Membrane electrolysis (0. 1 A, 3. 22 Â± 0. 60 V) extracted 28 Â± 6 % of carboxylates generated per day (on a carbon basis) and completely replaced caustic control of pH, with {{no impact on the}} total carboxylate production amount or rate. Hydrogen generated from the applied current shifted the fermentation outcome from predominantly C 2 and C 3 VFA (64 Â± 3 % of the total VFA present in the control) to majority of C 4 to C 6 (70 Â± 12 % in the experiment), with identical proportions in the VFA acid extract. A strain related to Megasphaera elsdenii (maximum abundance of 57 %), a bacteria capable of producing mid-chain VFA at a high rate, was enriched by the applied current, alongside a stable community of Lactobacillus spp. (10 %), enabling chain elongation of VFA through lactic acid. A conversion of 30 Â± 5 % VFA produced per sCOD fed (60 Â± 10 % of the reactive fraction) was achieved, with a 50 Â± 6 % reduction in suspended solids likely by electro-coagulation. Conclusions: VFA can be extracted directly from a fermentation broth by membrane electrolysis. The <b>electrolytic</b> water <b>reduction</b> products are utilized in the fermentation: OH- is used for pH control without added chemicals, and H 2 is metabolized by species such as Megasphaera elsdenii to produce greater value, more reduced VFA.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} {{of the few}} known molecular nitrogen-fixing systems, including nitrogenase enzymes, are of much interest but are not fully understood. We recently reported that Feâ€“N_ 2 complexes of tetradentate P_ 3 ^E ligands (E = B, C) generate catalytic yields of NH_ 3 under an atmosphere of N_ 2 with acid and reductant at low temperatures. Here we show that these Fe catalysts are unexpectedly robust and retain activity after multiple reloadings. Nearly {{an order of magnitude}} improvement in yield of NH_ 3 for each Fe catalyst has been realized (up to 64 equiv of NH_ 3 produced per Fe for P_ 3 ^B and up to 47 equiv for P_ 3 ^C) by increasing acid/reductant loading with highly purified acid. Cyclic voltammetry shows the apparent onset of catalysis at the P_ 3 ^BFeâ€“N_ 2 /P_ 3 ^BFeâ€“N_ 2 â€“ couple and controlled-potential electrolysis of P_ 3 ^BFe^+ at âˆ’ 45 Â°C demonstrates that <b>electrolytic</b> N_ 2 <b>reduction</b> to NH_ 3 is feasible. Kinetic studies reveal first-order rate dependence on Fe catalyst concentration (P_ 3 ^B), consistent with a single-site catalyst model.

In situ freeze-quench MÃ¶ssbauer spectroscopy during turnover reveals an ironâ€“borohydridoâ€“hydride complex as a likely resting state of the P_ 3 ^BFe catalyst system. We postulate that hydrogen-evolving reaction activity may prevent iron hydride formation from poisoning the P_ 3 ^BFe system.

50|$|Interstitial {{hydrides}} {{most commonly}} exist within metals or alloys. They are traditionally termed 'compounds', {{even though they}} do not strictly conform to the definition of a compound; more closely resembling common alloys such as steel. In such hydrides, hydrogen can exist as either atomic, or diatomic entities. Mechanical or thermal processing, such as bending, striking, or annealing may cause the hydrogen to precipitate out of solution, by degassing. Their bonding is generally considered metallic. Such bulk transition metals form interstitial binary hydrides when exposed to hydrogen. These systems are usually non-stoichiometric, with variable amounts of hydrogen atoms in the lattice. In materials engineering, the phenomenon of hydrogen embrittlement results from the formation of interstitial hydrides. Hydrides of this type form according to either one of two main mechanisms. The first mechanism involves the adsorption of dihydrogen, succeeded by the cleaving of the H-H bond, the delocalisation of the hydrogen's electrons, and finally, the diffusion of the protons into the metal lattice. The other main mechanism involves the <b>electrolytic</b> <b>reduction</b> of ionised hydrogen {{on the surface of the}} metal lattice, also followed by the diffusion of the protons into the lattice.
