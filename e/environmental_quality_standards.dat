40|$|The {{concentration}} {{and distribution of}} Pb, Zn, Cu and Cr in the surface soil of three grassed swales located {{in the city of}} Beijing, Jiaxing and Shenzhen were studied in this paper. Evaluations on the risk of heavy metals were conducted based on the second level limit of soil <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> <b>standard,</b> using different indexes (i. e., single item, comprehensive items and potential ecological risk indexes). Results show that the concentration of Pb, Zn, Cu and Cr in all the soil samples is within the limit of second level of soil <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> <b>standard</b> of China, except the soil samples of the grassed swale from Shenzhen city. The result also shows that the concentration of the four kinds of heavy metals in the surface soil of grassed swales is linearly correlated with the depth of soil sampling points.

50|$|The stated {{rationale}} for deregulation is often that fewer and simpler regulations {{will lead to}} a raised level of competitiveness, therefore higher productivity, more efficiency and lower prices overall.

30|$|The {{exceedance}} of the <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> <b>standard</b> in sediment and SPM at Prossen {{indicates a}} recent contamination near the German–Czech border. These findings agree with a monitoring programme by the RBC Elbe that revealed an exceedance of the EQS (20  µg kg− 1 in sediment and SPM, WFD) since 2012 with an increasing trend. This PCB contamination mainly consists of higher chlorinated PCBs, which are presumed to originate from a Škoda plant near Prossen.|$|R
30|$|One of {{the main}} issues is a joint design of agri-environmental schemes (AES) {{in order to improve}} the {{provision}} of environmental goods (Bartolini et al. [2012]). In fact, cross-compliance rules have been set as the baseline for the implementation and quantification of agri-environmental payments, which in turn require additional environmental recommendations (Scheele [2008]). As a result, cross-compliance provides an overall minimum <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> <b>standard</b> and prevents the fragmentary and uneven provision of environmental goods by AES (Juntti [2012]).|$|R
30|$|Cfree of PAHs {{remained}} largely constant while Cfree of PCBs varied along the Elbe River. The highest Ctotal of PCBs and PAHs {{were found at}} Prossen (km 13) and Meißen (km 96). PCB Ctotal even exceeded the <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> <b>standard</b> for sediment and SPM in Prossen. Site-specific distribution ratios (KD) revealed a stronger sorption for PAHs compared to PCBs, indicating a higher availability of PCBs. Equilibrium partitioning concentrations in lipids (Clip↔sed) showed a high correlation with actually measured lipid-normalised concentrations (Cbio,lipid) in bream. This indicates that PCB bioaccumulation in this benthic fish species is {{closely linked to the}} sediment contamination.|$|R

50|$|In {{order to}} achieve these goals, a variety of {{strategies}} and policies are used rather than legislation. The four strategies the German government bases air pollution control on are laying down <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> <b>standards,</b> emission reduction requirements according to the best available technology, production regulations, and laying down emission ceilings. Through these strategies, policy instruments {{have been put in}} place that have contributed {{to the success of the}} significant air pollution reduction in Germany. These instruments include the Federal Emission Control Act and Implementing Ordinances, Technical Instructions on Air Quality Control (TA Luft), Amendment to Ordinance on Small Firing Installations, Implementation of the directive on industrial emissions, and Transboundary air pollution control policy. The German Feed-in-Tariff policy introduced in 2000 led to the significant increase in renewable energy use and decreasing air pollution. They have been introduced in Germany to increase the use of renewables, such as wind power, biomass, hydropower, geothermal power, and photovoltaics, thereby reducing GHG emissions causing air pollution and combating climate change.|$|E
50|$|The {{third major}} {{development}} in China’s system of environmental governance {{which is also}} instrumental to the overall performance of all the decision-makers is the strengthening {{of the rule of}} (environmental) law. This can be identified as a modernization in environmental politics, closely tied to the emergence of a market economy. The system of environmental laws has led to the setting of <b>environmental</b> <b>quality</b> <b>standards</b> and emission discharge levels. There are signs that the rule of law is taken more seriously in the field of environments and this has been triggered by the opening up of China to the global economy and polity. The strengthening of the rule of environmental law goes together with more resources for enforcement, a more formal enforcement style of EPBs, and stronger (financial) punishments of companies. For instance, Courts are getting more involved in enforcement in addition to legal procedures initiated by citizens and environmental NGOs, such as the well-known Centre for Legal Assistance to Pollution Victims (CLAPV).|$|E

40|$|One of {{the drivers}} of green {{consumerism}} are social network externalities {{that are associated with}} buying 'green' because green consumerism is fashionable, or because of reputation effects. We analyze how the strength of this social network effect impacts green consumerism, environmental externalities and total welfare. We discuss a model where products are differentiated according to their <b>environmental</b> <b>quality,</b> where the production of green products generates positive externalities to all, and where those consumers purchasing a green product variety receive the additional benefits of {{being a member of the}} network of green consumers. Depending on the strength of the social network effect, we show that (a) firms may produce lower quality, (b) the market may generate fewer positive environmental externalities, and (c) total welfare may deteriorate.
