5|$|Bear McCreary {{was hired}} to compose the score for the series. McCreary stated that the main theme was based on his viewing of {{production}} designs for the opening title sequence. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> a full theme song as with his earlier works, McCreary chose to use a simple, repeating motif from the strings section.|$|E
5|$|Cream, a {{prominent}} {{character in the}} series, has a Chao named Cheese as a partner. In a move to keep her image safe, she often uses him to attack enemies <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so herself. Other notable Chao include Chaos, guardian of the Chao, who serves as an antagonist in Sonic Adventure; Omochao, a robotic Chao who appears in several games {{as a means of}} player tutorial; and Chocola, Cheese's twin whom Cream, Amy Rose, and Big the Cat search for over the course of Sonic Heroes.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 1951–52 season, Barnes returned to the New South Wales team in a bid to regain his Test position, and performed well. He was chosen by the selectors but the board disallowed his selection for conduct reasons rather than ability. The media figured this out and publicised it, and Barnes was overlooked for the whole season. Speculation abounded as to the nature of his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship was found; it accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so himself, and of denigrating umpires by making gestures implying they were blind.|$|E

5000|$|The {{names of}} the notes have {{historically}} been attributed to the hymn 'Ut queant laxis' by Paulus Diaconus, where UT is used <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>DO.</b> Mouravieff explains UT as indicating the uterus in the birth of flesh, and SI as representing [...] "the door of the second Birth, according to the Spirit".|$|R
5|$|In the meantime, {{the team}} was not {{announced}} at the scheduled time due to the delay caused by the veto. Journalists deduced the story and Barnes became a cause célèbre for many weeks, missing all the remaining Tests. Speculation abounded as {{to the nature of}} his supposed misdeeds. These included jumping the turnstile at a ground when he forgot his player's pass, insulting the royal family, theft from team-mates, drunkenness, stealing a car, parking his car in someone else's space, or that Barnes had lampooned the board in the narration accompanying the home movies he made of the 1948 tour. In later years, a file of unknown authorship regarding Barnes's behaviour was deposited in the NSWCA library. It accused Barnes of allowing young spectators to enter the playing arena to field the ball <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so himself, and of denigrating umpires by cupping his hands over his eyes and showing dissent by implying that they were blind.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{begins with}} an {{announcement}} by Tracy Jordan (Tracy Morgan) on television {{that he plans to}} travel to outer space, and is willing to pay up to thirty million dollars to do so. Jack Donaghy (Alec Baldwin) agrees to help Tracy with his dream of traveling in space, promising to call his friends at NASA. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> this, however, he asks The Girlie Show with Tracy Jordan (TGS) producer Pete Hornberger (Scott Adsit) to create a fake space experience for Tracy. Pete and the TGS crew construct a model space shuttle and place Tracy in it after disorienting him by flying him in a helicopter blindfolded. The deception is a success, and Tracy believes that he is, in fact, flying in space.|$|E

5|$|At the old lady's house, Gary {{has been}} fed a lot. The old lady puts out fresh sheets of flyers {{given to her}} by Patrick. Upon reading them, Gary realizes that SpongeBob truly loves him and wants him back. He tries to leave, but <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> that, he ends up going to the closet, filled with empty snail shells. When the old lady tries to feed him again, Gary finds that the old lady most likely has {{sinister}} motives—she is possibly trying to fatten and then eat him. He makes his escape, but the old lady chases him out onto the streets. Gary quickly finds one of the gangster snails he saw before, which the old lady now mistakes for Miss Tuftsy, and takes him home instead. Back home, SpongeBob gives up on his search for Gary, and tries to forget about him by taking a walk, but his memories keep coming to mind and upsetting him. He is constantly reminded as the streets are filled with posters and signs for Gary. SpongeBob then hears a meow. At first he thinks he is imagining Gary is there, but then he turns around to find Gary is actually at his side, and he is overjoyed to see his beloved pet again.|$|E
25|$|If {{the exact}} values of large factorials are needed, {{they can be}} {{computed}} using arbitrary-precision arithmetic. <b>Instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> the sequential multiplications , a program can partition the sequence into two parts, whose products are roughly the same size, and multiply them using a divide-and-conquer method. This is often more efficient.|$|E

25|$|Jordan studied music {{under his}} father, {{starting}} {{out on the}} clarinet. In his youth he played in his father's bands <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> farm work when school closed.

25|$|Finally, the {{sanction}} of a code was hoped {{to become an}} efficient instrument for the consolidation of the national unity that had been expensively obtained {{only a few years}} earlier.

25|$|Functions {{are also}} {{sometimes}} moved across rings {{in the other}} direction. The Linux kernel, for instance, injects a vDSO section in processes which contains functions that would normally require a system call, i.e. a ring transition. But <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> a syscall, these functions use static data provided by the kernel which prevents {{the need for a}} ring transition which is more lightweight than a syscall. The function gettimeofday can be provided this way.|$|E
25|$|Carleton S. Coon {{also has}} a {{hypothesis}} for why noses on Mongoloids are very distinct. Typically, the nose is not very prominent {{on the face of}} a Mongoloid. Their frontal sinus is also reduced in order to allow more room for padding to protect from their cold environment. Regardless of the environment that the mongoloid is in, his nose helps reduce the stress of the environment on their body by moistening the air inspired to cool the body off <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> a straight up heat exchange.|$|E

25|$|After {{the death}} of Alexander (323 BC), {{he was the first}} to propose in the council of officers, that either Arrhidaeus or Heracles, the son of Barsine, should at once be chosen as king, rather than waiting to see if the {{pregnant}} Roxana would bear a son. The Roman historian, Curtius, states that Meleager broke out into violent invectives against the ambition of Perdiccas and then abruptly quit the assembly in order to encourage the soldiery to express their opposition against Perdiccas. The Greek historian, Diodorus, states that Meleager was sent by the assembled generals to appease the clamours and discontent of the troops, but <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so, he joined the mutineers.|$|E
25|$|While {{investigating}} another victim, Fronsac finds a fang made of steel, {{which increases}} his doubts of the beast's existence.

As the investigation proves to be unfruitful, the king's weapons master, Lord de Beauterne, arrives to put an end to the beast. However, <b>instead</b> <b>of</b> <b>doing</b> so, Beauterne kills an ordinary wolf and tells Fronsac to alter the corpse so it resembles the monster. Fronsac hesitantly does so, and the bogus wolf is sent back to Paris, where it is put on display, much to the pleasure of the king and the French aristocracy.|$|E
