In this research we aim at 1) investigating the robustness of the <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution,</b> 2) understanding its drivers and 3) analyzing its impact on consumer behavior. Building on a large set of online reviews - over 78 million reviews from 16 major online platforms, we identify a robust <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> on many {{but not all of}} the platforms and product categories. Using secondary datasets, survey data and lab experiments, we demonstrate that the <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> is primarily driven by self-selection mechanisms while we rule out multiple alternative explanations of the <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> such as review fraud and scale truncation mechanisms. Finally, we show how the <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> can affect the informativeness of the reviews as well as the key measures of online reviews (the average rating and the number of reviews) ...|$|E

A size class distribution and a vegetation structure analysis were applied in order to analyze the dynamics of this forest using census data from 51 plots selected across 5 transects covering the hill-slope andwadi-bed habitats. Some of the trees inhabiting the hill-slopes (e. g. Acacia senegal and Commiphora spp.) were found to exhibit an inverse <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> with constant regeneration, whilst in the wadi bed these same trees exhibited a <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> (i. e. of declining populations). On the other hand, Acacia etbaica inhabiting the hill- slopes exhibited a tendency towards a <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> and an inverse <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> in the wadi-bed. All the populations (i. e. inhabiting the hill-slopes and the beds) of Anogeissus dhofarica had a <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> whereas all the populations of Blepharispermum hirtum had a more or less inverse <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution.</b> The Ziziphus spina-christi and Acacia tortilis populations, meanwhile, exhibited the bi-modal shape of size distribution. The shrubs inhabiting the hill-slopes (e. g.

Overall, most of the examined populations, except those of Acacia etbaica in wadi-bed and Blepharispermum hirtum, seemed to be under stress from both environmental and human factors, particularly in the wadi bed.

40|$|While product review {{systems that}} collect and {{disseminate}} opinions about products from recent buyers (Table 1) are valuable forms of word-of-mouth communication, {{evidence suggests that}} they are overwhelmingly positive. Kadet notes that most products receive almost five stars. Chevalier and Mayzlin also show that book reviews on Amazon and Barnes 2 ̆ 6 Noble are overwhelmingly positive. Is this because all products are simply outstanding? However, a graphical representation of product reviews reveals a <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> (Figure 1) with mostly 5 -star ratings, some 1 -star ratings, and hardly any ratings in between.

40|$|Soil N 2 O flux is {{sensitive}} to soil moisture content and soil temperature, which are in turn sensitive to changes in climate and topography. Thus, N 2 O flux measurements exhibit {{a high degree of}} spatial and temporal variability. Knowing how the spatial distribution of soil N 2 O flux changes over time in a hummocky, agricultural landscape will identify measurement scales appropriate for estimates of N 2 O emissions from these types of terrains. As well, little is known about N 2 O emissions from uncultivated, ephemeral wetlands in agricultural landscapes, but this information is needed for accurate inventories of N 2 O emissions. The objectives of this study were to describe the spatial and temporal distribution of soil N 2 O flux in a hummocky agricultural landscape, and to understand how soil water and soil temperature control the spatial and temporal patterns of N 2 O flux. For a hummocky, agricultural landscape in the Dark Brown soil zone of Saskatchewan, N 2 O flux and related soil variables were measured along a 128 -point transect multiple times over two years and concurrently from a 50 point, stratified design over three years. The spatial and temporal variation in N 2 O flux followed an event-based / background emission pattern. High flux events were triggered by precipitation events and recession of water from wetlands following spring snowmelt. Days with high mean flux were characterized by highly skewed (reverse <b>J-shaped)</b> <b>distributions.</b> High variance and coherency was observed at cultivated wetland elements during emission events. Strong location-dependent positive relationships were found between soil N 2 O flux and water-filled pore space or soil temperature, related to specific landscape elements. Background emissions were characterized by random variation or cyclic behavior that ranged in scale from 20 to 60 m. Cumulative emissions were highest from cultivated wetlands and basin centers of uncultivated wetlands, although emissions from cultivated wetlands were much more important to total cumulative emissions on an area basis. The results indicate that models intended to estimate N 2 O flux from these landscapes cannot rely on a single predictive relationship, but will have to incorporate predictive relationships localized at specific landscape elements depending on the time of year. At certain times predictive relationships cannot be used and up-scaled estimates will have to rely on direct measurement of emissions...|$|R

We demonstrate that the performance of a group may be strongly affected by the decision strategies used by its individual members and specify how this effect is moderated by environmental features. Specifically, in a set of simulation studies, we systematically compared four decision strategies used by the individual group members: two linear, compensatory decision strategies and two simple, noncompensatory heuristics. Individual decisions were aggregated by using a majority rule. To assess the ecological rationality of the strategies, we varied (a) the distribution of cue validities, (b) the quantity, and (c) the quality of shared information. Group performance strongly depended on the distribution of cue validities. When validities were linearly distributed, groups using a compensatory strategy achieved the highest accuracy. Conversely, when cue validities followed a <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution,</b> groups using a simple lexicographic heuristic performed best.

40|$|Several {{species of}} Lauraceae family {{are among the}} most common ones in the Araucaria Forest.

This paper analyzes the structural changes of eight species of Lauraceae family during 1995 - 2004 in a forest located in the center-south region of Parana State, Brazil. The species were investigated through structural and dynamic indicators: importance value (IVI), abundance, basal area, trunk volume, diameter distribution, spatial pattern, recruitment, mortality and increments. The results showed that the structural position of the Lauraceae family was kept almost unaltered in the community during the ten-year period. It was also noticed that the Lauraceae family is increasing in terms of abundance {{due to the fact that}} recruitment has been greater than mortality. However, growth rates have been very low, either in diameter and basal area/volume. Although most Lauraceae species show a slow dynamic behavior, some of them have experienced an intense chance process, such as Canela-amarela (Nectandra grandiflora Nees & Mart. ex Nees) which increased most of its structural and dynamic indicators, becoming the most remarkable species among all those studied.

Data were recorded for all individual trees. One plot (Saltonstall) was established in 1924 after the removal of a hardwood overstory. This stand had a nearly pure, almost fully closed understory of hemlock that was subjected to partial cuttings in 1936, 1954, and 1956. The stand was lost to the hemlock woolly adelgid (Adelges tsugae) in 1993. The other plot (Perry) was established in 1931 in a nearly pure hemlock stand that had arisen on an abandoned pasture around 1850. This plot had a crop-tree release cutting in 1931 and has not been infested with hemlock woolly adelgid. Both plots developed a rotated sigmoid diameter distribution, characteristic of uneven-aged forests, after sixty years of management. The 1936 attempt at group-selection cutting in the Saltonstall plot did not maintain the reverse <b>J-shaped</b> diameter <b>distribution</b> that had initially existed. The stand was essentially even-aged and the diameter distribution shifted to a broad bell-shaped form and then to a rotated sigmoid curve when a new age class grew large enough {{to be included in the}} tally. The thinning of the Perry plot also turned the initial bell-shaped diameter-distribution curve to the rotated sigmoid form for the same reason. Annual periodic increment (including harvested volumes) was 52 and 50 cubic feet/acre for the Saltonstall and Perry plot, respectively. Annual basal area growth decreased from over 3 ft 2 /acre to approximately 2 ft 2 /acre on both plots over sixty years.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{consumer}} ratings {{play a major role in}} the purchase decisions of online shoppers. To examine the effect of the variance of these ratings on future product pricing and sales we propose an analytical model which considers products where the variance of consumer ratings results from two types of product attributes: observational search attributes and experience attributes. We find that if a higher variance is caused by an observational search attribute it results in a higher equilibrium price and lower equilibrium demand, whereas if it is caused by an experience attribute the result is a lower equilibrium price and demand. Interestingly, when the average rating as well as the total variance of ratings are held constant and the relative share of variance caused by the observational search attribute is increased, we observe a rise in both the equilibrium price and the demand for products with low total variance. Via this mechanism, and depending on the composition of the variance of consumer ratings, it is possible for the equilibrium price and demand to increase with increasing total variance of product ratings. In other words we are able to demonstrate that, when faced with a choice between two similar products with the same average rating, risk-averse consumers may prefer a more expensive product with a higher variance of ratings. Moreover, our analytical model provides a theoretical foundation for the empirically observed <b>j-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> of consumer ratings in electronic commerce.

40|$|Abstract Calamus javensis is a {{widespread}} understorey rattan in Southeast Asia {{and is one of}} the dominant rattan species in Mt. Halimun National Park, West Java. This species can establish clumps either sexually with seeds or clonality with stolons. To analyze the role of sexual reproduction and clonality for clump estab-lishment in C. javensis, we studied the vegetative and genetic structures of the population. Totals of 2, 777 ramets comprising 1, 321 clumps were found in three 0. 16 ha plots. The number of ramets per clump showed reverse <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> with a maximum of 15. Clustering and stoloniferous ramets accounted for 62 and 20 % of all ramets, respectively. This indicates that C. javensis is actively engaged in clustering clonal growth. The longest stem was 14 m although 75 % of all stems were shorter than 1 m long. The stolon ranged from 6 to 538 cm in length, which decreased the local density of ramets. Using randomly amplified polymor-phic DNA (RAPD) analysis, we obtained 56 polymor-phic bands for 118 clumps sampled from one of the plots. All samples showed different RAPD banding patterns, except one pair at a distance of 225 cm from each other. The genetic similarity among samples closer than 10 m was significantly higher than the expected value from a purely random distribution. These results suggest that most separate clumps are established by recruitment from seeds, and most seeds dispersed near mother plants. Hence, in C. javensis, clonality is more a growth strategy to increase the size of the genet than a dispersion-propagation strategy to expand the habitat...|$|E

The study was conducted in an area of approximately 10 ha within Anadenanthera peregrina population owned by Celulose Nipo – Brasileira SA (19 ° 15 ’ 05 ’’S e 42 ° 20 ’ 30 ’W). Ten random plots (20 x 50 m) were established to sample individuals with CBH (diameter at breast height) ≥ 15 cm (Class I). It was installed a subplot of 10 x 10 m in the center of each plot to sample individuals with total height ≥ t 1. 30 m above the ground and CBH < 15 cm (Class II). Individuals in 20 x 50 m plots were classified according to their dispersal syndromes and successional guilds. In addition, it was performed the diameter distribution of samples. 510 individuals were found in Class I, belonging to 10 botanical families, 15 genera and 15 species; in Class II, 47 individuals from 10 families, 14 genera and 14 species, with the Sorensen similarity index equal to 48 %. Classification of successional species sampled in classes I and II showed higher species richness in early secondary succession, with the group formed by pioneers and early secondary totaling 93. 5 % in Class I and 93 % in Class II. Regarding dispersal syndromes, 60 % of species in Class I are wind-dispersed.

40|$|Medication non-adherence impacts {{public health}} by impeding the {{evaluation}} of medication efficacy, decreasing improvement and/or increasing morbidity in patients, while increasing health care costs. As a result, intervention studies are designed to improve adherence rates. Medication adherence is J-shaped in nature with many people taking their medication completely, a significant proportion taking no medication, and a substantial proportion taking their medication on some intermittent schedule. Therefore, descriptive statistics and standard statistical techniques (e. g., parametric t-tests, non-parametric Wilcoxon Rank Sum tests, and dichotomization) can provide misleading results. This study developed and evaluated a method to more accurately assess interventions designed to improve adherence. Better evaluation could lead to identifying new interventions that decrease morbidity, mortality, and health care costs. Parametric techniques utilizing a Gaussian distribution are inappropriate as <b>J-shaped</b> adherence <b>distributions</b> violate the normality assumption and transformations fail to induce normality. Additionally, measures of central tendency fail to provide an adequate depiction of the distribution. While non-parametric techniques overcome distributional problems, they fail to adequately describe the distribution's shape. Similarly, dichotomizing data results {{in a loss of}} information, making small improvements impossible to detect. Using a mixture of beta distributions to describe adherence measures and the expectation-maximization algorithm, parameter and standard error estimates of this distribution were produced. This technique is advantageous as it allows one to both describe the shape of the distribution and compare parameter estimates. We assessed, via simulation studies, α-levels and power for this new method as compared to standard methods. Additionally, we applied the technique to data obtained from studies designed to increase medication adherence in rheumatoid arthritis patients. Via simulations, the mixed beta model was shown to adequately depict adherence distributions. This technique performed better at distinguishing datasets, exhibiting power ranging from 66 % to 92 % across samples sizes. Additionally, α-levels for the new technique were reasonable, ranging from 3. 4 % to 5. 4 %. Finally, application to the "Adherence in Rheumatoid Arthritis: Nursing Interventions" studies produced parameters estimates and allowed for the comparison of interventions. The p-value for this new test was 0. 0597, compared to 0. 20 for the t-test...|$|R

We start from a simplified scenario for a particular pedestrian under specific traffic conditions. Then we take into account the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians via statistical unconditioning. We show that this in general leads to a U-shaped distribution of the pedestrians’ intended waiting time. This U-shaped distribution characterizes the nature of pedestrian street-crossing behavior, showing that in general there are a large proportion of pedestrians who cross the street immediately after arriving at the crossing point, and a large proportion of pedestrians who are willing to wait for the entire red-man phase.

40|$|AbstractStudies on plant {{population}} size structure provide important baseline information for monitoring and conservation. Traditionally, inverse <b>J-shaped</b> size class <b>distributions</b> (SCD) were considered indicative of ‘healthy’, stable {{plant population}}s; however, {{this may not}} hold true for long-lived, slow-growing species. This study assessed the population size structure of 19 populations of Aloe plicatilis, a Cape fynbos endemic tree aloe, and quantified population size and density. A strong positive linear relationship between stem diameter (SDr) and height was used to align SDr and height SCD bins, and to harmonize stage and size classes. Onset of reproduction occurs at ~ 15 cm SDr and ~ 0. 8 m in height. Some A. plicatilis individuals appear to display a ‘bonsai effect’ whereby the growth of individuals in very rocky sites is suppressed. Stunted plants may be non-reproductive ‘suppressed juveniles’ or ‘reproductive dwarfs’. The short, shrub-like growth form of many individuals may also result from height restrictions imposed by persistent strong winds. Population size, extent and density ranged from 31 to > 110 000 individuals, 0. 05 – 103 ha and 75 – 3000 plants/ha respectively. Bell-shaped SCDs were the most common (50 % of populations). The SDr and height SCDs for all populations combined were also bell-shaped. Seven populations displayed irregular SCDs, but were similar in structure to the bell-shaped SCDs, {{both of which were}} attributed to an adult-persistence population survival strategy. This study challenges the suitability of the inverse J as the only SCD indicative of healthy, stable populations for long-lived, slow-growing species. The study provides baseline demographic data on A. plicatilis across its distribution for long-term monitoring, and provides insights useful for examining trends in the demographics of other long-lived, slow-growing species...|$|R
40|$|Uneven-aged {{forests are}} assumed {{to have a high}} {{stability}} against storm damage but have rarely been analysed for vulnerability to storm damage {{due to a lack of}} a sufficient empirical database. Here we model storm damage in uneven-aged forest to analyse major factors that may determine the sensitivity of this type of forests to storms based on a broad database. Data are derived of public forests in the canton Neuchâtel in West Switzerland that are dominated by silver fir and Norway spruce and managed since the beginning of the 20 th century following a single-tree selection system. A unique dataset of periodical (every 5 - 10 years) full inventories measuring the diameter of every single tree including salvage cuttings was available for the investigation. The time series reached back until 1920 and covered an area of 16 000 ha divided into 3000 divisions. The effect of a major winter storm (‘Lothar') in December 1999 on these forests was investigated using a subset of 648 divisions. The influence of the vertical stand structure on the vulnerability of storm damage was studied using logistic regression models. To facilitate the analyses, an index of closeness to a <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> (LikeJ) based on the number of trees in different diameter classes was developed. Besides structural indices, variables representing stand characteristics, soil-related and topography-related variables were included. The results of our study show that the overall damage level of the investigated forests was rather low. The variables that entered the model for the uneven-aged stands were different to those that are normally significant for even-aged stands. While variables like stand structure, the timing of the harvesting and topographic variables entered a multivariate statistical model as significant predictors, standard predictors for storm damage in even-aged stands such as stand density, thinning intensity or species composition were not significant. We hypothesize that the uneven-aged structure of the investigated forests may be one reason for the low damage level we observed but emphasize the need for more detailed research to support this conclusio...|$|E

Craib) and broadleaf mixed forests on Changbai Mountain (Northeast China) over 19 years. At this site, inventory-based low-intensity selection cutting was used to maintain a continuous forest canopy. After two cutting events, results showed significant differences in growth, structure, and carbon storage among cutting intensities. When increasing cutting intensity, {{the growth rate of}} average diameter, basal area, and volume significantly increased, with the highest increment rates found in the plots with 20 % basal area removal. Tree diameters for all plots showed a roughly inverse <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> before cutting and a left-skewed unimodal distribution after two cuttings. Volume ratio (the relative amount of volume contained in different diameter classes) for small (6 - 14 cm), medium (14 - 26 cm), large (26 - 36 cm), and very large (> 38 cm) diameters remained unchanged in the plots with 5 and 10 % basal area removal, but increased in the plots with 15 and 20 % basal area removal, reaching approximately a 1 : 2 : 3 : 4 ratio in the plots with 20 % basal area removal after two selection cuttings. Net carbon storage increased when increasing cutting intensity, reaching maximum storage in the plots with 20 % basal area removal (cutting intensity and net C storage increase: 0 %, 7. 21 Mg C ha- 1, 5 - 10 %: 11. 68 Mg C ha- 1, 15 %: 21. 41 Mg C ha- 1, 20 %: 26. 47 Mg C ha- 1).

It has been suggested that the native tree species Acacia koa var. hawaiiensis Rock is not adequately reproducing and may be gradually disappearing from the montane rain forest in Hawaii. A structural analysis was carried out in an Acacia-Metrosideros-Cibotium montane rain forest on the east slope of Mauna Loa on the island of Hawaii, to determine the status of all woody plant species and especially the status of the tall dominant tree species Acacia koa. Profile diagrams were also made for systematically chosen segments in the stand. The profile diagrams showed three important structural variations within the homogenous vegetation stand. Woody plant distribution by size-classes, regardless of species, showed an inverse <b>J-shaped</b> <b>distribution</b> characteristic of a stable, self maintaining forest. Structural analysis of individual species populations showed good stability trends for most low-stature and intermediate-stature tree species, but some species were less abundant than others. Acacia koa was present in all size-classes. The stand contained four times as many seedlings and suckers as tall emergent trees. Thus, this species is regenerating and maintaining itself. Low numbers of koa saplings, small trees and intermediate-sized trees may reflect rapid height growth, rather than a gradual decline of this species in the forest. Larger numbers of koa seedlings may also get established in pulses when large canopy gaps are formed. Rooting activity of feral pigs destroys Acacia koa seedlings rooted in mineral soil. Most of the healthy koa saplings were observed on root collars of scattered wind-thrown koa trees. This type of “gap-phase replacement” can be related to the protection seedlings receive from pig activity. Pig populations, if allowed to increase, may cause a change in the stability trends of species populations, and an overall deterioration of this native rain forest ecosystem. The study was supported by NSF Grant No. GB 23230 of the Island Ecosystems IRP under the US/International Biological Program and a grant provided by the Bishop Estate Corporation...|$|E

Developing {{sustainable}} {{mechanisms for}} use-management of forest products by user communities {{has been suggested}} as a possible solution to the often-observed conflict between forest use and the conservation of protected forests. In Zimbabwe, the use of forest products in protected forests by local communities has a long history, but few studies have explored both the socio-economic and ecological aspects of this use. This {{study was conducted in}} the Baikiaea plurijuga forests and woodlands in and around Fuller Forest in western Zimbabwe, protected since 1943. It explored the characteristics and dynamics of forest products use by communities surrounding this protected forest. Further, the demography and dynamics of commonly harvested woody species was examined in order to establish the present status of populations of these species. This examination, focusing on diameter class distributions, was aimed at informing whether species populations were expanding, stable or declining in view of their capacity to continue providing required goods and services. Results indicated that all households, rich and poor, were harvesting at least some forest resources from the protected forest, with the most frequently harvested resources being firewood, wood for curios, thatch grass, wild fruits, timber for construction and fencing and those who owned livestock used the forest for livestock grazing. The extraction and use of 23 different products was recorded across the villages. The top five harvested forest products in terms of the mean proportion of households using them were fuelwood, building poles, thatch grass, wild fruits and broom grass. Forest products were harvested both for own consumption and for sale. At present Baikiaea plurijuga, Colophospermum mopane, Brachystegia spiciformis, Diplorhynchus condylocarpon, Commiphora mocambicensis and Bauhinia petersiana out of 14 commonly harvested species appear to have relatively stable populations as indicated by their inverse <b>J-shaped</b> diameter class <b>distribution</b> profiles. Preliminary indications from this baseline information point towards the successful integration of local use of forest products and conservation objectives noting that there is need for caution until further studies as recommended in this study are taken...|$|R
40|$|Resource {{and forest}} {{management}} in Nepal: Resource management is of current global interest {{because of its}} role in sustaining natural resources and livelihood for future generations. Hardin's paper, the Tragedy of the Commons", served {{as a starting point}} to the wider discussion on challenges for sustainable resource management. Hardin's theory is widely cited in the context of forest management, especially to explain forest degradation, e. g. in the Himalaya where forest degradation has a long history. During the 1950 s- 1970 s it became increasingly difficult to ignore the warnings of severe on-going deforestation in Nepal. Forests were nationalized and owned by the state and they were poorly, if at all, managed. In practice they were therefore commons' in the way that Hardin used the concept; an area of open access resources for anybody to use. The precarious situation pushed forth the formation of institutions and policies that aimed to secure forest sustainability by regulating forest-product outtake. Community Forestry (CF) management was introduced in the late 1970 s. Rights to use forests were decentralized from top-down governmental management to bottom-up management by means of locally-run Community Forests (CFs). Theories, aims and hypotheses: Deforestation and forest degradation have shifted towards a stable or a growing forest cover in several areas. Contrary to Hardin's argument that commons' will be depleted if not managed by a public government system or private land tenure, Ostrom argues that communities are capable of managing resources in sustainable ways by self-regulating practices and social check-ups. I hypothesise that her argument is valid with changes in underlying human-ecological factors such as forest user-density and market proximity, i. e. I assume that forests can regenerate sustainably independently of the number of users per forest area, distance to the urban centre and the main district road. I test this by analysing the regeneration of Shorea robusta and Schima wallichii in six CFs located in Ludikhola watershed, Gorkha district, Nepal. The close located forests were heavily degraded when CF management was established c 30 years ago. Methods: I combined results from systematic forest sampling and interviews to determine if forest regeneration is sustainable under the current management regime. Physical and biological features were analysed in a total of 90 plots (10 m&# 61620; 10 m) in a balanced design. Recruits were counted, and DBH of trees measured. I used univariate and multivariate statistics to analyse the quantitative data, whereas qualitative data were used to contextualize numerical results. Major results and conclusions: The CFs are regenerating in a sustainable manner. This is shown by reversed <b>J-shaped</b> size-class <b>distributions</b> and sufficient number of recruits. The environmental variables with the greatest impact on recruits indicate that both species are prone to disturbances related to land-use. Shorea robusta recruits decrease with denser canopy closure and more leaf litter on the ground. The intensity of lopping does not influence the number of recruits, but decreases seedling abundance; and number of recruits decreases in areas where many stems were cut. Environmental variables with an impact on Schima wallichii recruits are fewer, and the environmental variable that explains most of the variability within Schima wallichii recruits is degree [...] ...|$|R
30|$|The {{emphasis}} on continuous canopy structures (avoidance of clearcuts) typifies forests growing under natural disturbance regimes characterized by small scale disturbances, e.g., pathogen-induced mortality or mechanical damage (Lutz and Halpern 2006). In {{much of the}} world, the spatial scale of natural disturbance regimes can be represented by a <b>J-shaped</b> size frequency <b>distribution,</b> i.e., a combination of frequent small-scale and fewer large-scale disturbances (Veblen et al. 1981; Seymour and Hunter 1999; Shorohova et al. 2009; Yasuda et al. 2013). Examples of disturbances that generate these patterns include wildfires, e.g., in the western United States and Australia, or windstorms, e.g., in storm-prone regions of Western Europe (Schelhaas et al. 2003) or in the temperate forests of southern Chile (Veblen 1985). In such regions, a focus on any single silvicultural approach will only reflect a subset of patterns and dynamics found under natural conditions (Seymour and Hunter 1999). For example, region-wide applications of a management regime that focused only on continuous overstory cover would not promote conditions and patterns associated with severe, larger-scale disturbances, e.g., certain early successional habitat features. In such cases, the {{emphasis on}} smaller-scale variability in stand structure may reflect natural conditions found in individual stands, {{but it may not}} reflect the overall landscape-scale dynamics. Such concerns are currently discussed regarding the lack of early-seral habitat on federal land in the Pacific Northwest of the USA (Swanson et al. 2011; Franklin and Johnson 2012). Since natural disturbances such as fire and windstorms cannot be totally prevented or controlled in most forest landscapes, concern about the lack of selected disturbance effects may be of little practical relevance in the long run. Exceptions are situations where management artificially reduces the probability of occurrence of large-scale or stand-replacing disturbances. Examples of such situations include the application of short rotations that prevent trees from reaching heights common in older forests, and thus may reduce windthrow. Alternatively, density management aims to reduce tree stress to the remaining trees by ensuring higher light, water, and nutrient levels, and thus may limit competition related mortality (either directly due to drought or indirectly, e.g., insect related mortality due to low vigor, often found in high-density unmanaged stands (e.g., Neumann and Minko 1981). Also, fuel management may reduce the extent of large-scale fire disturbances. Hence, practices that change “natural” disturbance regimes must be carefully assessed in terms of their implications on landscape dynamics, and restoration may be required in some cases. For example, controlled burning as a restoration technique can be beneficial for threatened species in boreal forests where there has been extensive long-term fire suppression (Kouki et al. 2012).|$|R
