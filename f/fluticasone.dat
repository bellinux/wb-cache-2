5|$|Twenty {{percent of}} modern {{pharmaceuticals}} contain fluorine. One of these, the cholesterol-reducer atorvastatin (Lipitor), made more revenue {{than any other}} drug until it became generic in 2011. The combination asthma prescription Seretide, a top-ten revenue drug in the mid-2000s, contains two active ingredients, one of which – <b>fluticasone</b> – is fluorinated. Many drugs are fluorinated to delay inactivation and lengthen dosage periods because the carbon–fluorine bond is very stable. Fluorination also increases lipophilicity because the bond is more hydrophobic than the carbon–hydrogen bond, and this often helps in cell membrane penetration and hence bioavailability.|$|E
25|$|Sinus {{infections are}} treated by {{prolonged}} courses of antibiotics. The development of nasal polyps or other chronic changes within the nasal passages may severely limit airflow through the nose, {{and over time}} reduce the person's sense of smell. Sinus surgery {{is often used to}} alleviate nasal obstruction and to limit further infections. Nasal steroids such as <b>fluticasone</b> are used to decrease nasal inflammation.|$|E
25|$|Oral steroids such as {{prednisolone}} {{are commonly}} used; however, side effects are common, {{and the horse}} may be predisposed to laminitis. Therefore, the use of aerosolised steroids via an equine inhaler are becoming more common. This route of administration reduces the dose required, {{and the risk of}} side effects. Originally, beclomethasone was used, but newer compounds are available now, such as <b>fluticasone</b> propionate.|$|E
25|$|Glucocorticoids {{marketed as}} anti-inflammatories are often topical formulations, such as nasal sprays for {{rhinitis}} or inhalers for asthma. These preparations {{have the advantage}} of only affecting the targeted area, thereby reducing side effects or potential interactions. In this case, the main compounds used are beclometasone, budesonide, <b>fluticasone,</b> mometasone and ciclesonide. In rhinitis, sprays are used. For asthma, glucocorticoids are administered as inhalants with a metered-dose or dry powder inhaler.|$|E
25|$|When eosinophilic {{pneumonia}} {{is related}} to an illness such as cancer or parasitic infection, treatment of the underlying cause is effective in resolving the lung disease. When due to AEP or CEP, however, treatment with corticosteroids results in a rapid, dramatic resolution of symptoms {{over the course of}} one or two days. Either intravenous methylprednisolone or oral prednisone are most commonly used. In AEP, treatment is usually continued for a month after symptoms disappear and the x-ray returns to normal (usually four weeks total). In CEP, treatment is usually continued for three months after symptoms disappear and the x-ray returns to normal (usually four months total). Inhaled steroids such as <b>fluticasone</b> have been used effectively when discontinuation of oral prednisone has resulted in relapse.|$|E
25|$|In September 2016, Russian hackers hacked the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) ADAMS {{anti-doping}} {{system and}} released {{data on a}} number of athletes, including Chris Froome and Bradley Wiggins. Therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) are medical exemptions athletes can be given when they need treatment for pre-existing medical conditions where the drugs used in the treatment are on the WADA prohibited compound list. The leak demonstrated that Wiggins had received TUEs for triamcinolone acetonide in June 2011, June 2012 and April 2013, a number of days {{before the start of the}} 2011 Tour de France, 2012 Tour de France, and 2013 Giro d'Italia respectively. Wiggins also received TUEs for salbutamol, <b>fluticasone,</b> formoterol and budesonide whilst at Team Highroad. Froome had received TUEs for prednisolone in May 2013 and during the 2014 Tour de Romandie.|$|E
