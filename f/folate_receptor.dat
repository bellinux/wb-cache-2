40|$|Abstract In this study, {{we report}} the preparation, lumi-nescence, and {{targeting}} properties of folic acid-CdTe quantum dot conjugates. Water-soluble CdTe quantum dots were synthesized and conjugated with folic acid using 1 -ethyl- 3 -(3 -dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide-N-hydroxysuccinimide chemistry. The influence of folic acid on the luminescence properties of CdTe quantum dots was investigated, and no energy transfer {{between them was}} observed. To investigate the efficiency of folic acid-CdTe nanoconjugates for tumor targeting, pure CdTe quantum dots and folic acid-coated CdTe quantum dots were incubated with human nasopharyngeal epidermal carcino-ma cell line with positive expressing folic acid receptors (KB cells) and lung cancer cells without expression of folic acid receptors (A 549 cells). For the cancer cells with positive <b>folate</b> <b>receptors</b> (KB cells), the uptake for CdTe quantum dots is very low, but for folic acid-CdTe nanoconjugates, the uptake is very high. For the lung cancer cells without <b>folate</b> <b>receptors</b> (A 549 cells), the uptake for folic acid-CdTe nanoconjugates is also very low. The results indicate that folic acid is an effective targeting molecule for tumor cells with overexpressed <b>folate</b> <b>receptors...</b>|$|R

50|$|Folate is {{required}} for cell division, and rapidly dividing cancer cells often express folate receptors in order to capture enough folate to support rapid cell growth. Elevated expression of the <b>folate</b> <b>receptor</b> occurs in many diseases, including other aggressively growing cancers and inflammatory disorders.

40|$|Mesoporous silica {{nanoparticles}} functionalized {{by surface}} hyperbranching polymerization of polyethylene imine), PEI, were further modified by introducing both fluorescent and targeting moieties, {{with the aim}} of specifically targeting cancer cells. Owing to the high abundance of <b>folate</b> <b>receptors</b> in many cancer cells as compared to normal cells, folic acid was used as the targeting ligand. The internalization of the particles in cell lines expressing different levels of <b>folate</b> <b>receptors</b> was studied. Flow cytometry was used to quantify the mean number of nanoparticles internalized per cell. Five times more particles were internalized by cancer cells expressing <b>folate</b> <b>receptors</b> as compared to the normal cells expressing low levels of the receptor. Not only the number of nanoparticles internalized per cell, but also the fraction of cells that had internalized nanoparticles was higher. The total number of particles internalized by the cancer cells was, therefore, about an order of magnitude higher than the total number of particles internalized by normal cells, a difference high enough to be of significant biological importance. In addition, the biospecifkally tagged hybrid PEI-silica particles were shown to be noncytotoxic and able to specifically target folate receptor-expressing cancer cells also under coculture conditions. © 2009 American Chemical Society...|$|R

Moreover, quantitative flow cytometry analysis confirmed the receptor-mediated targeted delivery of the nanoparticles into different FR-expressing cells. The internalization of particles was ten-fold higher in the FR-positive KB cancer cells compared to that in the FR-negative A 549 cancer cells; the difference was significant enough to be of biological importance.

50|$|Transport of folate {{compounds}} into mammalian {{cells can}} occur via receptor-mediated (see <b>folate</b> <b>receptor</b> 1) or carrier-mediated mechanisms. A functional coordination between these 2 mechanisms {{has been proposed}} to be the method of folate uptake in certain cell types. Methotrexate (MTX) is an antifolate chemotherapeutic agent that is actively transported by the carrier-mediated uptake system.

50|$|Folic acid (FA, folate or vitamin B9), {{is a vital}} {{nutrient}} {{required by}} all living cells for nucleotide biosynthesis and for the proper metabolic maintenance of 1-carbon pathways. Aside from its cofactor role for intracellular enzymes, FA also displays high affinity for the <b>folate</b> <b>receptor</b> (FR), a glycosylphosphatidyinositol-linked protein that captures its ligands from the extracellular milieu and transports them inside the cell via a non-destructive, recycling endosomal pathway. The FR is also a recognized tumor antigen/biomarker. Because of this, diagnostic and therapeutic methods which exploit the FR’s function are being developed for cancer.|$|E
50|$|Specificity of folate conjugates for the FR {{has been}} shown by {{competition}} tests with free folate. When this ligand, known to bind the FR, is added {{in excess of the}} folate conjugate, it outcompetes the conjugate, indicating that the folate conjugate specifically binds the FR, and not other receptors, in the process of receptor-mediated endocytosis. Addition of an enzyme that frees the <b>folate</b> <b>receptor</b> from the cell membrane and addition of antibodies to the FR also reverse the internalization of folate conjugates, providing further evidence that folate conjugates bind the FR with specificity.|$|E

30|$|The further {{quantitative}} analysis of fluorescence intensity (Fig. 3 b) evidenced the visual findings, {{and there was}} no significant difference between folic acid-DNA tetra-Dox and DNA tetra-Dox complexes (P <  0.05).
