Materials and Instruments 1. An <b>electric</b> <b>tape,</b> double-wired and {{graduated}} in feet, tenths and hundredths of feet. <b>Electric</b> <b>tapes</b> commonly are mounted on a hand-cranked and powered supply reel that contains space for the batteries and some device (“indicator”) for signaling when the circuit is closed (fig. 1). 2. An older model <b>electric</b> <b>tape,</b> also known as an “M-scope, ” marked at 5 -foot intervals with clamped-on metal bands (fig. 2) {{has been replaced by}} newer, more accurate models. Technical procedures for this device are available from the procedures document archives. 3.

50|$|In Pakistan and India, <b>electric</b> <b>tape</b> is very {{commonly}} used to wrap a tennis ball for purposes of playing backyard cricket. The <b>electric</b> <b>tape</b> provides a smooth surface, causing the tennis ball to grip a concrete surface less, makes the ball harder to hit, and causes it to bounce less. These properties make the ball behave more like a leather cricket ball, yet still being substantially cheaper and less dangerous.|$|R

40|$|VERSION: 2010. 1 PURPOSE: To obtain {{data from}} which an {{estimate}} of hydraulic conductivity of an aquifer can be calculated. During a slug test the water level in a well is changed rapidly, {{and the rate of}} water-level response to that change is measured. From these data, {{an estimate of}} hydraulic conductivity can be calculated using appropriate analytical methods (for example, Ferris and Knowles, 1963). A slug test requires a rapid (“instantaneous”) water-level change and measurement of the water-level response at high frequency. A rapid change in water level can be induced in many ways, including injecting or withdrawing water, increasing or decreasing air pressure in the well casing, or adding a mechanical device like a plastic rod to displace water. The water-level changes can be measured with many methods, including steel <b>tape,</b> <b>electric</b> <b>tape,</b> air line, wireline/float, an...|$|R

40|$|Seven shallow {{monitoring}} {{wells and}} eight neutron access tubes (arranged in “nests ” with tensiometers) {{were used to}} take measurements of water-table and soil-moisture changes over periods of water-table decline following high groundwater levels and flooding in the riparian zone in Sep. -Oct. 2003 and Aug. -Sept. 2004. Water-table measurements were taken every 15 minutes using pressure transducers; these data were then calibrated with <b>electric</b> <b>tape</b> measurements performed periodically throughout the study. Neutron access tubes located near the wells (Figure 6) provided soil moisture profiles across the water table at each location. In 2004, the water-table fell below {{the bottom of the}} 4 original access tubes, and 4 additional deeper tubes were installed closer to the wells. The Skaggs method requires that soil moisture profiles remain in equilibrium with the water table (i. e. the vertical hydraulic gradient above the water table is zero). Graphical analysis was used to identify several soil moisture profiles consistent with this criterion; Figure 4 shows three profiles that wer...|$|R
30|$|A {{load cell}} {{with a maximum}} range of 1  kN was {{connected}} to the lower side of a universal testing machine cross-head (Shimadzu Co., Autograph AG-X- 50 kN).

A wire of 0.042, 0.063, 0.137, 0.216, or 0.296  mm in diameter was fastened to the grippers under an initial load. Two pieces of <b>gauge</b> <b>tape</b> were placed on the wire so that the gap between each tape and its nearest gripper was 10  mm, as shown in Fig.  2.

40|$|With climate change, over-population, and {{resource}} depletion in mind, I decided to explore what photography {{might look like}} in an apocalypse-like situation. High-end DSLR cameras have become ubiquitous in photography today {{but they are not}} the only means of producing photographs. In my honors project, I examine how images can be created with even the most limited technology. To simplify photography as much as possible, I researched pinhole photography, which was first used in the mid- 1800 s. By creating a small enough aperture with a tool such as a pin, an image could be projected onto a film plane. This was the perfect technique for my research, because pinhole cameras did not require a lens, viewfinder, or a shutter more complex than a piece of black tape. I could easily construct a pinhole camera even in the most limited conditions. I found containers in various locations and fashioned them into pinhole cameras using tools I either borrowed or previously owned, staying true to my apocalyptic theme. I purchased only 15 worth of new materials to construct the cameras. Even the books I used for research were either purchased secondhand or borrowed from the library. To record the images, I used 5 x 72 ̆ 2 sheets of semi-matte low contrast Arista. Edu darkroom paper as my negatives in the larger cameras. In the small camera, I used both 100 ISO 35 mm color and monochromatic film. Through my project, I identified exactly what tools were needed, at minimum, to make a camera that could produce a photograph. I also learned how to precisely measure the pinhole and focal length for the clearest focus. Beyond this, the process was not highly rigid. Many of the components could be improvised using items already in my home: black <b>electric</b> <b>tape</b> to make the camera light-tight, a magnet for an impromptu shutter, previously-used film canisters as take-up reels. Each pinhole camera had its own unique flaws, but they were relatively minor considering their makeshift quality. Shooting perfect images with the cameras, though, was nearly impossible. While virtually any container that could be made light-tight could be fashioned into a camera, they lacked the conveniences of modern cameras. Yet, each of these limitations tested my knowledge and ability as a photographer like never before...|$|R

Next, the cross-head was elevated by 2  mm at a speed of 10  mm/min. The positions of the edge and the tape were again measured with the height gauge. The distance between the edge and the tape (upper gripper-tape gap) was calculated.|$|R
