5|$|Four {{full-scale}} development (FSD) aircraft were constructed. The {{first of}} these (BuNo 161396), used mainly for testing performance and <b>handling</b> <b>qualities,</b> made its maiden flight on 5 November 1981, piloted by Plummer. The second and third FSD aircraft, which introduced wing leading-edge root extensions and revised engine intakes, first flew in April the following year; the fourth followed in January 1984. The first production AV-8B was delivered to the Marine Attack Training Squadron 203 (VMAT-203) at Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point (MCAS Cherry Point) on 12 December 1983, and officially handed over one month later. The last of the initial batch of 12 was delivered in January 1985 to the front-line Marine Attack Squadron 331 (VMA-331). The engine used for these aircraft was the F402-RR-404A, with 21,450lb (95.4kN) of thrust; aircraft from 1990 onwards received upgraded engines.|$|E
5|$|In December 2006, the Center for Naval Analyses {{released}} a report on U.S. small arms in combat. The CNA conducted surveys on 2,608 troops returning from combat in Iraq and Afghanistan over the past 12 months. Only troops who fired their weapons at enemy targets were allowed to participate. 341 troops were armed with M249 SAWs, making up 13 percent of the survey. 71 percent of M249 users (242 troops) {{reported that they were}} satisfied with the weapon. 40 percent of users preferred feeding the SAW with the soft 100-round pouch, while 21 percent chose the soft and hard 200-round pouches each. 60 percent (205 troops) were satisfied with <b>handling</b> <b>qualities,</b> such as handguards, size, and weight - of those dissatisfied, just under half thought that it was too heavy. M249 users had the lowest levels of satisfaction with weapon maintainability at 70 percent (239 troops), most due to the difficulty in removing and receiving small components and poor corrosion resistance. The SAW had the highest levels of stoppages at 30 percent (102 troops), and 41 percent of those that experienced a stoppage said it had a large impact on their ability to clear the stoppage and re-engage their target. 65 percent (222 troops) did not need their machine guns repaired while in theater. 65 percent (222 troops) were confident in the M249's reliability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will fire without malfunction, and 64 percent (218 troops) were confident in its durability, defined as level of soldier confidence their weapon will not break or need repair. Both factors were attributed to high levels of soldiers performing their own maintenance. 60 percent of M249 users offered recommendations for improvements. 17 percent of requests were for making the weapon lighter, and another 17 percent were for more durable belt links and drums, as well as other modifications, such as a collapsible stock.|$|E

40|$|Due to {{the digital}} {{transformation}} online service strategies have gained prominence in practice {{as well as}} in the theory of service management. This study examines the efficacy of different types of service channels in customer complaint handling. The theoretical framework, developed using complaint handling and social media literature, is tested against data collected from two different channels (hotline and social media) of a German telecommunication service provider. We contribute to the understanding of firm’s multichannel distribution strategy in two ways: a) by conceptualizing and evaluating complaint <b>handling</b> <b>quality</b> across traditional and social media channels, and b) by testing the impact of complaint <b>handling</b> <b>quality</b> on key performance outcomes like customer loyalty, positive word-of-mouth, and cross purchase intentions...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a methodology {{for the design}} of longitudinal controllers for high performance aircraft operating over large ranges of angle of attack. The technique used for controller design is structured singular value or mu synthesis. The controller is designed to minimize the weighted H-infinity norm of the error between the aircraft response and the desired <b>handling</b> <b>quality</b> specifications without saturating the control actuators. The mu synthesis procedure ensures that the stability and performance of the aircraft is robust to parameter variations and modeling uncertainties included in the design model. Nonlinear simulations demonstrate that the controller satisfies <b>handling</b> <b>quality</b> requirements and provides excellent tracking of pilot inputs over a wide range of transient angles of attack and Mach number...|$|R
40|$|A {{previous}} paper (1977) {{has presented}} results from flight simulator experiments on instrument-flight-rule handling-quality studies of a STOL-type {{aircraft in the}} presence of various models of simulated turbulence (Gaussian, modified Gaussian, Rayleigh, and variable length and intensity, VLI). In this paper, additional results are presented for flight simulator experiments on visual-flight-rule approach landings of a STOL-type aircraft. Pilot opinion ratings of the landing approach with visual display are analyzed to determine the most realistic turbulence model and to identify the variables that critically affect the <b>handling</b> <b>quality</b> of aircraft in turbulence. It is shown that turbulence simulated by a VLI model adequately match the desired statistical properties of real atmospheric turbulence, and that aircraft <b>handling</b> <b>quality</b> and pilot task performance are critically affected by turbulence.

25|$|The Aviation Systems Division conducts {{research}} and development in two primary areas: air traffic management, and high-fidelity flight simulation. For air traffic management, researchers are creating and testing concepts to allow {{for up to three}} times today's level of aircraft in the national airspace. Automation and its attendant safety consequences are key foundations of the concept development. Historically, the division has developed products that have been implemented for the flying public, such as the Traffic Management Advisor, which is being deployed nationwide. For high-fidelity flight simulation, the division operates the world's largest flight simulator (the Vertical Motion Simulator), a Level-D 747-400 simulator, and a panoramic air traffic control tower simulator. These simulators have been used for a variety of purposes including continued training for space shuttle pilots, development of future spacecraft <b>handling</b> <b>qualities,</b> helicopter control system testing, Joint Strike Fighter evaluations, and accident investigations. Personnel in the division have a variety of technical backgrounds, including guidance and control, flight mechanics, flight simulation, and computer science. Customers outside NASA have included the FAA, DOD, DHS, DOT, NTSB, Lockheed Martin, and Boeing.|$|E

500|$|Küchemann's and Weber's papers {{changed the}} entire nature of {{supersonic}} design almost overnight. Although the delta {{had already been}} used on aircraft prior to this point, these designs used planforms that were {{not much different from}} a swept wing of the same span. Weber noted that the lift from the vortex was increased by the length of the wing it had to operate over, which suggested that the effect would be maximised by extending the wing along the fuselage as far as possible. Such a layout would still have good supersonic performance inherent to the short span, while also offering reasonable take-off and landing speeds using vortex generation. The only downside to such a design is that the aircraft would have to take off and land very [...] "nose high" [...] to generate the required vortex lift, which led to questions about the low speed <b>handling</b> <b>qualities</b> of such a design. It would also need to have long landing gear to produce the required angle of attack while still on the runway.|$|E
