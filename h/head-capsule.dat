40|$|AbstractBiomass is a {{fundamental}} measure for understanding the structure and functioning (e. g. fluxes of energy and nutrients in the food chain) of aquatic ecosystems. We aim to provide predictive models to estimate the biomass of Triplectides egleri Sattler, 1963, in a stream in Central Amazonia, based on body and case dimensions. We used body length, <b>head-capsule</b> width, interocular distance and case length and width to derive biomass estimations. Linear, exponential and power regression models {{were used to assess}} the relationship between biomass and body or case dimensions. All regression models used in the biomass estimation of T. egleri were significant. The best fit between biomass and body or case dimensions was obtained using the power model, followed by the exponential and linear models. Body length provided the best estimate of biomass. However, the dimensions of sclerotized structures (interocular distance and <b>head-capsule</b> width) also provided good biomass predictions, and may be useful in estimating biomass of preserved and/or damaged material. Case width was the dimension of the case that provided the best estimate of biomass. Despite the low relation, case width may be useful in studies that require low stress on individuals...|$|E
40|$|Determining the instar of {{mountain}} pine beetle (Coleoptera: Curculionidae) larvae by {{the width of}} their head capsules K. P. Bleiker, 1 J. Régnière Abstract—Cut-points to distinguish larval instars of the mountain pine beetle (MPB), Dendroctonus ponderosae Hopkins (Coleoptera: Curculionidae), from the measurement of <b>head-capsule</b> width were determined using a maximum likelihood approach. The cut-points that distinguish the four instars are suitable to classify individual larvae from field populations collected from lodgepole pine Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelmann (Pinaceae) or jack pine (P. banksiana Lambert) × lodgepole pine hybrids {{throughout most of the}} beetle’s current range in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. The ability to designate the instar of field-collected larvae will facilitate the calibration of phenology and populations models that assess the climatic suitability of habitats and the potential for MPB to continue expanding its range. Identifying the instar of insect larvae allows the description of age distributions in populations...|$|E

40|$|Whilst a copious {{literature}} {{testifies to}} the value of subfossil insect analyses in the interpretation of Holocene deposits (Buckland Ind Coope, 1991; Elias, 1994), most of this results from studies of Coleopterous material. Although Dipterous fragments are often abundant in the same deposits, they have received little attention. This Thesis is concerned primarily with establishing the great value of Dipterous subfossill and the potential for advances in this field. Dipterous morphology is considered and features of primary value in the identification of subfossil material is highlighted. Problems with the traditional taxonolic criteria, insofar as identification of such material is concerned, are discussed, and new approaches are recommended. Thus, a brief survey of the morphology of Tipuloid larval <b>head-capsules,</b> and a revisional paper on the puparia of British Sphaeroceridlt, are included. The study includes many case-studies from excavations across the region, spanning the last 5, 000 years. Although there, is an inevitable bias in favour of archaeological sites, and hence of the more synanthropic elements of the Dipterous fauna, situations un associated with human settlements are also discussed. A major objective in this work was to examine the role of Diptera in the insect colonisation of lands left in a state of tabula rasa by receding glaciations, The geographical aea concerned here comprises the entire North Atlantic continental seaboard and islands from France and Labrador northwards. This area saw the major western expansion of the Celts, Romans and the Vikings, from whose settlements much of the Dipterous material from archaeological deposits was obtained for this thesis. It also saw the eastern migration of Inuit cultures from the Canadian Arctic into Greenland. Dipterous subfossils tell us much of the living conditions and economies of these peoples...|$|R
40|$|Cellulose-inferred lake water oxygen-isotope {{records were}} {{obtained}} from five throughflow lakes situated along a north-south transect across Fennoscandia to help develop a better picture of Holocene changes in atmospheric circulation in the region. This research addresses prior evidence {{for the existence of}} non-temperature-dependent shifts in d 18 O of precipitation in the early Holocene attributed to changes in atmospheric circulation. The validity of this hypothesis is tested through the development of oxygen-isotope records from lake sediments and their interpretation in the context of independent reconstructions of temperature and precipitation from pollen and chironomid <b>head-capsules</b> collected from the same or nearby sites, and well-documented changes in vegetation composition. Records of carbon and nitrogen elemental content and isotopic composition and magnetic susceptibility are included in this multi-proxy investigation. Extensive modern isotope hydrology datasets spanning several years at four of the five sites also help to inform interpretations of the cellulose d 18 O records. Key results from this research are: 1) Elevated d 18 O in relation to prevailing temperature occurred during the early Holocene (c. 10, 000 - 6000 cal. BP) for sites in northern Fennoscandia (Lake Tibetanus, Lake Spåime), in harmony with previous interpretations suggesting that strong zonal atmospheric circulation led to deepening of the precipitation and isotope shadows in the lee of the Scandes Mountains. 2) Evidence from a southern site (Arbovatten) reveals a previously unrecognized negative offset in the d 18 O-temperature relation during the early Holocene, apparently transferred directly from the North Atlantic without the orographic effects associated with a topographic barrier. 3) The modern d 18 O-temperature relation appears to have been established throughout Fennoscandia by c. 6000 - 4000 cal. BP, probably due to generally weaker circumpolar atmospheric circulation in response to lower summer insolation. 4) Comparison of two sites (Lake Spåime, Svartkälstjärn) in a west-east transect across central Fennoscandia reveals higher-frequency variability in atmospheric circulation at submillennial scales throughout the Holocene, which appears to be analogous to contemporary variability in the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) at seasonal-to-decadal time-scales. Evidence of such NAO-like variability also exists at two northern sites (Lake Keitjoru, Oikojärvi) during the Holocene, likely reflecting variations in summer and winter atmospheric circulation. 5) Complex lake-specific changes in productivity occurred in response to Holocene climate change, as revealed by carbon and nitrogen elemental and isotopic data in lake sediments. A major shift in atmospheric circulation pattern occurring at c. 4000 cal. BP probably led to a reduction in soil-derived 13 C-depleted nutrients in five lakes (Lake Keitjoru, Oikojärvi, Lake Spåime, Svartkälstjärn, Arbovatten) associated with changes in terrestrial vegetation. Changes in sediment nitrogen isotope composition also occurred in these lakes at c. 4000 cal. BP, possibly reflecting changing nutrient supply dynamics because of enhanced nitrogen losses during spring snowmelt...|$|R

In contrast with other Zps spp., sqme females initiated galleries {{under conditions of}} female-biased sex ratios, and sometimes 2 or more males were present in a gallery. In general, however, I. latldens exhibited typical ipine characteristics. A single male usually admitted l- 3 females into a gallery. Females oviposited {{at a rate of}} 2. 25 eggs/day and achieved a mean fecundity of 64. 4 eggs. The larval stage comprised 80 % of the generation time (egg to teneral adult) and analysis of <b>head-capsule</b> widths disclosed 3 larval instars. The mean survivorship within broods was 56. 0 % after 70 days; the reproductive success of monogamous pairs of beetles was 36. 1 teneral adults. Single females constructed 34 egg tunnels/gallery system; hence, harem size cannot always be inferred from the number of egg tunnels in each gallery. The mean generation time in the laboratory was 2. 07 x greater than for I. pini. By comparing laboratory data on I. latidens with laboratory and field data on I. pini, the generation time of I. latidens is estimated at 64124 days in the field. In south-central British Columbia, I. latidens probably has 1 generation, and possibly 2 broods...|$|E
40|$|The carob moth, Ectomyelois ceratoniae Zeller, is a pest of {{agricultural}} commodities and stored products around the world. Carob moth {{is known to}} infest citrus in the Mediterranean region and in southern Africa. In grapefruit cultivars, carob moth infestations are associated {{with high levels of}} mealybug. However, although this relationship has been observed in other citrus types such as Navel oranges, this has never been quantified. A recent survey of infested fruit from various production areas in South Africa indicated that the pest status of carob moth on Navel oranges may have been underestimated. As a result of the incidental pest status of carob moth on citrus in South Africa in the past, a species specific integrated pest management (IPM) programme does not exist. Therefore, the overriding aim of this theses was to evaluate the pest status of carob moth in citrus and establish a species specific IPM programme by determine the autecology of carob moth in citrus. Reliable methods for monitoring carob moth in citrus orchards both for producers and for research purposes were developed. A user-friendly monitoring method for determining weekly carob moth infestation through dropped fruit was suitable for producers. A timed scouting method was also developed; although the accuracy of this method varied with the experience of the scout. The pest status of carob moth was highest in the Loskop Valley, Nelspruit and the Vaalharts production areas and economic injury to growers ranged from R 512. 35 to R 3 719. 80 per hectare {{as a direct result of}} infestation. No infestation was recorded in the Sundays River Valley and Citrusdal production areas over both the 2014 - 15 and 201516 growing seasons. A laboratory study showed the survival of carob moth larvae infesting citrus is less than 10 % in the absence of mealybug. However, this increases to almost 40 % in the presence of mealybug residues and sooty mould. There was a significant relationship between carob infestation at harvest and mealybug infestation in the middle months of the growing season. The relationship between carob moth and mealybug indicates that current production guidelines for the management of mealybug in citrus may need to be amended. Consequently, it is proposed that an orchard with a history of carob moth infestation and a high mealybug infestation in the previous season should be subjected to an early season preventative application of a registered control product. Also, if mealybug infestation in December is higher than a 5 % of fruit per tree, then a corrective application of a registered product is recommended. The application of 2, 4 -D at petal drop reduced the size of the navel-end opening, decreasing the proportion of mealybug found in the navel-end, subsequently reducing carob moth infestation, resulting in a direct benefit for producers. Products registered for the control of false codling moth (FCM), Thaumatotibia leucotreta Meyrick, were effective in reducing carob moth infestation. In a spray trial conducted over two seasons, Delegate® and Runner® reduced infestation significantly in the 2014 - 15 season (over 80 %), while only Delegate® was effective in the 2015 - 16 season (over 80 %). If a late season corrective chemical application is targeted at both FCM and carob moth, this application should take place between 6 - 7 weeks prior to harvest. The mating disruption product, SPLAT® EC, reduced carob moth infestation by 70 % compared to the untreated control. A laboratory culture was established and <b>head-capsule</b> size categories were determined for all five carob moth instars. A parasitoid survey indicated that parasitism of carob moth larvae is generally less than 5 % in citrus orchards and a new species of Braconidae was described as Phanterotoma carobivora van Achterberg and Thackeray. Carob moth fifth instar were found to be the most cold-tolerant larval stage, and were shown to be more cold susceptible than the most cold-tolerant FCM instars at - 0. 55 ºC for eighteen days. This cold treatment resulted in a mortality of 94. 6 % fifth instar carob moth compared to a combined fourth and fifth instar mortality of 87. 8 % for FCM after eighteen days. These results indicate that post-harvest cold treatments targeting FCM will be as, if not more, effective against carob moth, suggesting that current phytosanitary legislation for carob moth should be amended to incorporate this study’s findings...|$|E
