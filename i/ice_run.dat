50|$|The Cresta Run and the SMTC {{were founded}} by devotees of sledding (tobogganing in British parlance) who adopted a head-first (prone) {{technique}} of racing down an icy run, {{as opposed to}} the feet-first (supine) and somewhat faster luge race. Both evolving sports were natural extensions of the invention of steerable sleds during the early 1870s by British guests of the Kulm hotel in St. Moritz. These initial crude sleds were developed almost accidentally - as bored well-to-do gentlemen naturally took to intramural competition in the streets and byways of twisty mountainous downtown St. Moritz hazarding each other and pedestrians alike. This gave impetus to a desire to steer the sleds, and soon runners and a clumsy mechanism evolved to allow just that along the longer curving streets of the 1870s. This also allowed higher speeds on the longer runs. Local sentiments varied, but eventually complaints grew vociferous and Kulm hotel owner Caspar Badrutt built the first natural <b>ice</b> <b>run</b> for his guests, as he had worked hard to popularize wintering in the mountain resort, {{and did not want to}} lose any customers to ennui, nor his workforce to injury from errant sleds on the streets.|$|E

50|$|In 1515, Hachenbach {{passed along}} with the other villages in the Eßweiler Tal (dale) into the lordship of the Waldgraves and Rhinegraves of Grumbach. In 1595, the Eßweiler Tal, and thereby Hachenbach too, then passed to the Duchy of Palatinate-Zweibrücken. Like many other villages in the region, Hachenbach, too, was utterly {{destroyed}} in 1677 in the Franco-Dutch War (1672-1678) by French King Louis XIV’s troops. Even though a 1755 agreement between Palatinate-Zweibrücken and the Rhinegraves of Grumbach resulted in the cession of ﬁve villages by the former back to the latter, Hachenbach remained with Zweibrücken and received a customs station at the bridge across the Glan, for Hachenbach had become a border village. This bridge, ﬁrst built as a stone bridge in 1751/1752, was of special importance to the village. All postal and road trafﬁc between Meisenheim and Zweibrücken went across this bridge {{in the area of the}} so-called Hohe Straße (“High Road”). The bridge had its ﬁrst documentary mention in 1693, when it was newly built, although it was still only a wooden bridge then. The cost of this bridge, which was completed in May 1752 and which was thereby the earliest known crossing of the Glan, was 1,746 Gulden, two thirds of which (1,164 Gulden) was borne by the treasury of the Zweibrücken Oberamt of Lichtenberg, and the other third of which (582 Gulden) was borne by the administration of the Lordship of Kellenbach. In 1784, the bridge was heavily damaged in an <b>ice</b> <b>run</b> on the Glan, and thus Duke Carl II August of Zweibrücken saw to it in 1789 that a great two-storey-high and 70-foot-long (actually the old German measure called a Schuh, which literally means “shoe”; this was >20 m) wing wall was built onto the bridge on the Hachenbach (right) side, obliged as he felt to shield the bridge against any further such misfortunes. In 1794, the French military broke the arch nearest the Hachenbach side. Until 1825, a wooden emergency bridge was used, until the stone bridge could be set right again. As before, the cost was split at a ratio of 2:1, between the rightful heirs to the lordships on each side of the Glan, but the total this time was only 850 Gulden.|$|E

40|$|Waves and {{associated}} ice runs {{caused by the}} release of ice jams can interact with the ice in a receiving channel, producing complex wave-ice dynamics. These interactions are believed to vary between two extremes, termed ‘sheet front ’ and ‘rubble breaking front ’ propagation. The highly dynamic flow situation, combined with the ice-water interactions, makes {{this one of the}} most complex problems in river ice engineering. In this study, numerical simulations were carried out using a simplified one-dimensional flow and ice dynamic model to investigate possible approaches to modeling ice jam release wave propagation for the case where there is ice in the receiving channel. The results show that the ice accumulates rapidly at the rubble breaking front, quickly leading to grounding of the simulated <b>ice</b> <b>run</b> whereas for sheet front propagation, consideration must be taken of the different speeds of the <b>ice</b> <b>run</b> and the breaking sheet front, to avoid excessive thickening...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{an influence}} of sea ice anomaly in the Pacific {{sector of the}} Southern Ocean upon large-scale atmospheric circulation using an Atmospheric General Circulation Model (AGCM). It {{is well known that}} Pacific South American (PSA) teleconnection pattern is induced by El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) over the Southern Hemisphere. Changes in zonal winds associated with the PSA pattern affect sea ice anomalies in the Amundsen-Bellingshausen Sea (Pacific sector) and the Weddell Sea (Atlantic sector) of the Southern Ocean, which is called Antarctic Dipole (ADP) pattern. Based on the ADP sea-ice anomalies, an AGCM simulation under the low sea-ice condition in the Pacific sector and Atlantic sector (<b>Ice</b> <b>run)</b> are conducted.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} role Arctic sea ice plays in {{determining}} {{mean sea level}} pressure and 1000 hPa temperatures during Northern Hemisphere winters while focusing on {{an extended period of}} October to March. This is accomplished by investigating two regions of the same size and comparable climatic zones and elevations in the Northern Hemisphere. A breakdown of 29 years of reanalysis data into average monthly values, anomalies, trends, and comparisons between regions serves as current data to compare with a computer model control run. Ensuring the control run accurately models current atmospheric patterns, altering the model inputs to have no permanent Arctic sea ice will then show what winters could look like in the Siberian and Canadian regions if Arctic sea ice continues to diminish. The results for the reanalysis show that the Siberian region has higher MSLP and lower 1000 hPa temperatures than the Canadian region. The control run accurately captures the seasonal cycle from the reanalysis, except the values were offset slightly. Expected conditions associated with no sea ice would be warmer temperatures and lower pressures, and this situation is reflected in the results from the no sea <b>ice</b> <b>run</b> for the Canadian region. However, the no sea <b>ice</b> <b>run</b> results indicate stronger pressures and colder temperatures in the Siberian region, particularly from January to March...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Recent {{advances}} in discrete element modeling now allow the direct simulation of river ice dynamics. By resolving the contact and body forces acting {{on thousands of}} individual floes at each time step, the initiation, grounding, and formation of river ice jams can be simulated and studied. The concomitant water flow can be modeled using a coupled unsteady hydraulic model, with feedback provided between floes and water by water drag and blockage of the channel flow area by ice. Four regimes of water flow are modeled: open-channel flow with no ice; flow under moving or stationary ice; high Reynolds number porous flow through grounded and floating ice masses; and flow transported in the interstices of moving ice masses. In this study we investigate the forces exerted by an <b>ice</b> <b>run</b> on a cylindrical pier ice control structure. We initiate an <b>ice</b> <b>run</b> by holding ice at the upstream end of a channel. When the ice is released it is carried downstream by the surge. The ice is stopped by a row of piers placed in a line across the channel. We analyze the time history of the forces exerted by the ice on the piers and {{the momentum of the}} moving ice. This allows us to investigate the relationship between the rate of change of momentum and the forces on the piers, channel banks, and bottom. The simulated moments on the ice control structure are compared with results of a similar physical model experiment. 1...|$|E

40|$|In {{late winter}} and early spring, ice covers become weak in {{strength}} and break-up. The {{passage of the}} resulting ice floes may be arrested at a downstream location and create an ice jam. The increase in ice and water pressures may eventually cause the break-up of the blockage. The sudden release of the jam can result in violent ice runs and surges. Ice jam related floods can cause substantial damage to property, erode river beds, endanger hydraulic structures and affect safety at river crossings. The current understanding of the breakup ice jam phenomena is insufficient and therefore the state-of-the-art is not well advanced. There is an urgent need to improve it. The primary objective {{of this study is}} to identify and determine through laboratory as well as numerical modeling, the processes involved during the collapse of an ice jam and the formation, development and propagation of the resulting surges and <b>ice</b> <b>run.</b> The research work was carried out in three parts, namely the investigation of the phreatic water levels along an ice jam, the transport of accumulation ice covers, and the characteristics of surges and ice runs caused by the jam release. From this study, five different types of release mechanisms related to the break-up of ice jams were identified. It was evident that the surge characteristics depend primarily on the type of release mechanism and the prevailing initial hydrodynamic conditions prevailing immediately before release. Observations showed that during the collapse of the jam, its thickness profile at the toe of the ice jam undergoes redistribution for a short period of time and subsequently the ice mass moves downstream in a relatively single layer scenario, A two-dimensional two-layer model is formulated for the simulation of an ice jam release event. The model is capable of simulating the phreatic water surface profile along an ice jam, the formation, development and propagation of the surge and <b>ice</b> <b>run</b> after the release and the redistribution of ice jam thickness after release. The numerical model was validated by the experimental data of the present and post studies...|$|E
40|$|Breakup ice jams have {{occurred}} in the lower Grasse River when there was a significant breakup <b>ice</b> <b>run</b> from the upper river before the melt out of the ice cover in the lower river. The formation of a severe ice jam in the lower river could induce significant bed scour. In the spring of 2003 a severe ice jam was observed in the lower Grasse River, which caused bed scour in Alcoa’s capping pilot study area. In this paper, a numerical model study using the DynaRICE model is presented to provide a better understanding on the processes of ice jam formation and associated flow conditions in the lower Grasse River concerning the bed stability. The model was calibrated against observations, including tree scarring and associated water levels and ice thicknesses, of a severe jam that occurred in 2003. The model was then used to evaluate the potential impact of future jams on the integrity of the bed sediments...|$|E
40|$|A {{new concept}} in breakup ice control is presented. Current {{state-of-the-art}} breakup ice control structures (ICS) consist of piers that retain the breakup {{ice in the}} main river channel while passing relief flow via an adjacent floodplain. The ability to bypass flow around the structure is critical because it reduces upstream stage rise, the potential for ice blowout at the piers and ice jam failure. A major drawback with {{this approach is that}} many rivers with ice jam problems lack upstream sites with floodplains suitable for bypass flow. This paper introduces the concept of in-channel relief flow for ice retention at sites without floodplains. An L-shaped pier configuration is used, with transverse piers to stop the breakup <b>ice</b> <b>run</b> and longitudinal piers to maintain an ice-free flow relief channel along one side of the jam. The concept was developed as a possible means of preventing under-ice scour associated with ice jams that form naturally in the lower Grasse River (McShea et al., 2005). The DynaRICE ice-hydraulic numerical model (Shen et al., 2000) was used assess the feasibility of the concept and optimize general design parameters...|$|E

40|$|The Mackenzie Basin is {{composed}} of eight sub-basins (North Mountains, Liard, Peace, Athabasca, Great Bear Low Plains, Great Slave and Arctic Red) and includes three large lakes (Great Bear Lake, Great Slave Lake, Lake Athabasca) and three deltas (Peace-Athabasca Delta, Slave Delta, Mackenzie Delta), {{one of which is}} the world’s largest inland delta (Peace-Athabasca Delta). Annually, the Mackenzie River experiences freeze-up during the fall season and ice break-up in the spring, having an important influence on the basin hydrology Furthermore, the type of ice break-up event is dependent on the magnitude of hydrological and meteorological conditions present. In light of the decreasing network of ground-based stations operated by the Water Survey of Canada on the Mackenzie River, this study explored the use of satellite remote sensing data to improve monitoring capabilities during the ice break-up period. MODIS Level 3 snow products (MOD/MYD 10 A 1) and MODIS Level 1 B radiance products (MOD/MYD 02 QKM) are used to monitor ice cover during the break-up period on the Mackenzie River, Canada, for 13 ice seasons (2001 - 2013). The initiation of the break-up period was observed to occur between days of year (DOY) 115 - 125 and end DOY 145 - 155, resulting in average melt durations of 30 - 40 days. Floating ice running northbound could therefore generate multiple periods of ice-on and ice-off observations at the same geographic location. At the headwaters of the Mackenzie River, ice break-up was thermodynamically driven as opposed to dynamically, as observed downstream near the Mackenzie Delta. MODIS observations also revealed that ice runs were largely influenced by channel morphology (islands and bars, confluences and channel constriction). MODIS was found to be a powerful tool for monitoring ice break-up processes at multiple geographical locations simultaneously along the Mackenzie River. Finally, MODIS was found to be a viable tool for estimating river ice velocity where channel morphology least affected river flow. <b>Ice</b> <b>run</b> velocities north of 66 ° N ranged from 1. 21 - 1. 84 ms- 1...|$|E
