6000|$|... "Really, Gerard, {{you are so}} violent <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>opinions</b> that I {{am sorry}} I spoke of Lady Rachel. Shall I find you equally prejudiced, and equally severe, if I change the subject to dear Lady Lena? Oh, don't say you think She is false, too!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I don't {{think you}} would speak as you do, if you knew how much your words hurt me. In such a matter as this I should not be {{justified}} <b>in</b> allowing <b>your</b> <b>opinions</b> to have weight with me. But your sympathy {{would be so much}} to me!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah-uh. I savvy. I reckon you're {{giving me}} a hunch that <b>in</b> <b>your</b> private <b>opinion</b> Matthews isn't exactly {{straight}} where some interests are concerned. Hardman's for instance. I've run across that sort of deal in half a dozen towns." ...|$|R
