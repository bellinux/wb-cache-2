He got $3,000; that was it. I thought that was terrible and I just knew that NHRA, which was the bigger of the two associations, could afford to pay a lot better than that. So, I came up with the idea of the Professional Racers Association and the PRA Challenge, which I was determined to run opposite NHRA’s Nationals in 1972. I approached Jim Tice and he thought we could pull it off.” ...|$|E
40|$|This NebGuide {{discusses}} {{the pros and}} cons to consider as dairy producers evaluate raising their own replacement heifers or contracting with someone else to raise replacements. Every successful dairy operation can account for most of the expenses that occur on the farm. But how many can actually cash flow each segment of the operation? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> it costs to raise your dairy heifers or what percentage of your total expenses can be directly attributed to the milking herd? Few producers spend much time attempting to cash flow or estimate costs of the various parts of the dairy enterprise. If producers try to allocate expenses they usually work with the milking herd and then allocate the rest to heifer rearing. This NebGuide proposes that a producer do the opposite. Keep an accurate track of your heifer rearing expenses to see if it would be more profitable for you to have your heifers custom-reared...|$|E

40|$|Yesterday I {{showed that}} in {{advanced}} countries happiness has not risen, despite unprecedented increases in income. Today I {{want to try to}} explain this, and to draw some policy conclusions. But first I need to start with a caution (Figure 1). As the golfer says, “Researchers say I’m not happier for being richer, but <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> researchers make?” In one sense the golfer is on to something. For there are two key facts that we have to explain. First at any one time rich people are on average happier than poorer ones. And yet over time advanced societies have not grown happier as they have grown richer. What is happening is illustrated in this table (Table 1). In 1975 rich people (in the top quarter) were happier than poor ones (in the bottom quarter). The same was true in 1998, when both groups were both richer than before (especially the top group). But in 1998 each group was no more happy then before, despite its higher income. That is the challenge, and the paradox...|$|E
30|$|The old {{religions}} {{said he was}} {{an atheist}} who {{did not believe in}} God. The new religion says that he is the atheist who does not believe in himself. But it is not selfish faith, because the Vedanta, again, is the doctrine of oneness. It means faith in all, because you are all. Love for yourselves means love for all, love for animals, love for everything, for you are all one. It is the great faith which will make the world better. I am sure of that. He is the highest man who can say with truth, ‘I know all about myself’. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> energy, how many powers, how many forces are still lurking behind that frame of yours? What scientist has known all that is in man? Millions of years have passed since man first came here, and yet but one infinitesimal part of his powers has been manifested. Therefore you must not say that you are weak. How do you know what possibilities lie behind that degradation on the surface? You know but little of that which is within you. For behind you is the ocean of infinite power and blessedness (Vivekananda 1976 a, 301 – 302).|$|E
40|$|<b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>much</b> the {{textbook}} you have selected for your course will cost students? Are the CD and/or supplementary materials bundled with {{the textbook}} really {{necessary for the}} course? How often are new editions of a textbook released by the publisher? Are there significant differences between editions? Answers to these questions {{and their impact on}} the cost of textbooks are eye-opening! In less than 20 years, textbook prices have nearly tripled, “rising at the average rate of six percent per year ” (Powers, 2006). A California Public Interest Research Group found that 22 frequently assigned textbooks had an average cost of $ 131. 44 (Capriccioso, 2006). For an undergraduate student taking a full load of courses, the cost of textbooks alone can easily add up to several hundred dollars a semester and several thousand dollars over a four-year period. Considering these numbers, it is understandable why there is uproar over the escalating cost of textbooks. To address this issue, state policy makers and universities are exploring ways to ensure students have access to affordable textbooks. In 2004, the Illinois Board of Higher Education requested university faculty, student groups and bookstore managers examine college textbook prices and the feasibility of a textboo...|$|E
