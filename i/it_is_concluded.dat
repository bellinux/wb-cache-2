5|$|Albinism was {{observed}} in jungle cats (Felis chaus) and jackals (Canis aureus) along the coastline of the southern Western Ghats (Kerala and Kanyakumari coast, India). Albinism {{was observed}} in jungle cats from the Amaravila area of Trivandrum district in the Kerala State. Albinism in jackals was observed from the Polooni area in Malappuram district and Chaliyam area of Calicut district (Kerala).As albinism is observed in those areas where the density of these mammals is comparatively low, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>concluded</b> that continuous inbreeding could be the reason for expression of albinism.|$|E

The Board further concludes that the management personnel of Imperial Airlines should have been aware of the manner in which company operations were being accomplished. It is believed that the substandard maintenance practices of Imperial's employees were condoned by management. The manner in which maintenance and personnel records were kept by the company confirms this conclusion.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 1977 A {{computer}} simulation was {{developed as a}} technique for studying {{the effects of the}} process dynamics on the operator's sampling and control behavior. This methodology was used to study the effects of the process input memory variation in the presence of different observation noise levels. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>concluded</b> that the input memory and the observation noise level did not have any effect on the operator's sampling and control behavior. The experimental design was then reformed, and another set of experiments was conducted to study the effects of the observation noise level on the operator's behavior {{in the absence of any}} input memory variation. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>concluded</b> that the different noise levels had an adverse effect on the operator's behavior. That <b>is,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>concluded</b> that as the noise component increased, the operators tended to behave less economically. In addition to the above, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>concluded</b> that the operators had experienced a learning phenomenon in relation to the performed task...|$|R

25|$|Administration a 100mg/m² dose over {{a one-hour}} {{infusion}} gave a mean {{total body clearance}} of 21 L/h/m² and a mean steady state volume of distribution of 73.8 L/m² or 123 L based on the mean BSA (body surface area) of 1.68 m². Area under the plasma concentration-time curve had a mean value of 2.8mg.h/L. The Cmax of docetaxel {{was found to be}} 4.15 ± 1.35mg/L. Increased dose resulted in a linear increase of the area under the concentration-time curve and so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>concluded</b> that dose is directly proportional to plasma concentration.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{research}} done, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>concluded</b> {{that children}} exposed to extensive vocabulary and complex grammatical structures more quickly develop language and {{also have a}} more accurate syntax than children raised in environments without complex grammar exposed to them. With motherese, the mother talks to the child and responds back to the child, {{whether it be a}} babble the child made or a short sentence. While doing this, the adult prompts the child to continue communicating, which may help a child develop language sooner than children raised in environments where communication is not fostered.|$|E

25|$|Extragalactic ammonia was imaged {{using the}} VLA in IC 342. The hot gas has {{temperatures}} above 70 K, which was inferred from ammonia line ratios {{and appears to}} be closely associated with the innermost portions of the nuclear bar seen in CO. NH3 was also monitored by VLA toward a sample of four galactic ultracompact HII regions: G9.62+0.19, G10.47+0.03, G29.96-0.02, and G31.41+0.31. Based upon temperature and density diagnostics, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>concluded</b> that in general such clumps are likely to be the sites of massive star formation in an early evolutionary phase prior to the development of an ultracompact HII region.|$|E
25|$|Within the Cardamone et al. paper, {{comparisons}} {{are made with}} other compact galaxies, namely Blue Compact Dwarfs Galaxies and UV-luminous Galaxies, at local and much higher distances. The findings show that GPs form a different class of galaxies than Ultra Blue Compact Dwarfs, but may {{be similar to the}} most luminous members of the Blue Compact Dwarf Galaxy category. The GPs are also similar to UV-luminous high redshift galaxies such as Lyman-break Galaxies and Lyman-alpha emitter. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>concluded</b> that if the underlying processes occurring in the GPs are similar to that found in the UV-luminous high redshift galaxies, the GPs may be the last remnants of a mode of star formation common in the early Universe.|$|E

2500|$|The {{psychological}} connectedness objection {{claims that}} a being can be seriously harmed by being deprived of a valuable future {{only if there}} are sufficient psychological connections—sufficient correlations or continuations of memory, belief, desire and the like—between the being {{as it is now}} and the being as it will be when it lives out the valuable future.
