25|$|The monoamine {{hypothesis}} was compelling, especially based on apparently successful clinical results with early antidepressant drugs, {{but even at}} the time there were <b>discrepant</b> findings. Only a minority of patients given the serotonin-depleting drug reserpine became depressed; in fact reserpine even acted as an antidepressant in many cases. This was inconsistent with the initial monoamine theory which said depression was caused by neurotransmitter deficiency.|$|E

25|$|The IDF {{said they}} had {{destroyed}} the zoo while en route to another objective and because an alternate route had been booby-trapped. According to Human Rights Watch, the deliberate and time-consuming nature of the destruction, the seizure of the four-story Juma’ house, and the stationing of several tanks there for over a day means {{that it was not}} an action en route, but rather part of enforcing a cordon. The Guardian alleged that the IDF issued multiple <b>discrepant</b> accounts to explain its actions. Mohammed Juma also accused Israeli soldiers of stealing valuable African parrots.|$|E
25|$|AuCoin's {{opposition}} to U.S. support of authoritarian governments in El Salvador and Guatemala and the Nicaraguan Contras—irregular forces armed by the Reagan administration {{to topple the}} Sandinista government—led him to travel frequently to Central America to document right wing human rights abuses. In 1987, a constituent of AuCoin's named Ben Linder was killed by Contra forces while helping build a small hydroelectric electricity generator for Nicaraguan villagers. Pressed by AuCoin to investigate, the U.S. State Department noted <b>discrepant</b> accounts of Linder’s death: the Contras asserted that Linder died in a firefight, but village witnesses claimed the Contras gave no opportunity to surrender and assassinated Linder at point-blank range.|$|E
25|$|The {{details of}} the campaign, as related by Livy, and {{illustrated}} by the incidental anecdotes of Plutarch, are full of horror and they make clear that Cato reduced Hispania Citerior to subjection with great speed and little mercy. We read of multitudes who, after they had been stripped of all their arms, put themselves to death because of the dishonour, of extensive massacres of surrendered victims, and the frequent execution of harsh plunders. The phrase bellum se ipsum alet—the war feeds itself—was coined by Cato during this period. His proceedings in Hispania were not <b>discrepant</b> with the received idea of the fine old Roman soldier or with his own firm and over-assertive temper. He claimed to have destroyed more towns in Hispania than he had spent days in that country.|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} case of Chng Wei Meng v. Public Prosecutor (2002), the appellant was given, pursuant to section 42A of the Road Traffic Act ("RTA"), {{a written warning}} stating {{that he might be}} disqualified from driving if he failed to attend court for a traffic offence. An oral warning to the same effect was also given to the appellant. Before the appellant was arrested under section 43(4) of the RTA for driving while under disqualification, he was disqualified from driving after failing to attend court. The appellant appealed against his conviction, claiming inter alia {{that there had been a}} breach of natural justice because the written warning and the requirements of section 42A(1)(d) of the RTA were <b>discrepant,</b> since the section provided that he would be disqualified from driving for failure to attend court. The appellant also submitted that he had not been served a disqualification notice. Chief Justice Yong Pung How dismissed the appeal. He stated that in order for the notice to be vitiated by non-compliance with section 42A, the non-compliance had to be fundamental, substantive and material in nature. However, this was not so on the facts of the case. In addition, to establish a breach of natural justice, the applicant had to prove that he had suffered substantial prejudice or injustice as a result of the non-compliance with section 42A since there is no such thing in law as a technical breach of natural justice. However, on the facts there had been little prejudice caused to the appellant since he had read the notice and knew the consequences of not attending court, but had promptly forgotten all about it.|$|E
500|$|Though Vera was {{accurately}} forecast and its track into Japan {{was well}} anticipated, limited coverage of telecommunications, combined with lack of urgency from Japanese {{media and the}} storm's intensity, greatly inhibited potential evacuation and disaster mitigation processes. Rainfall from the storm's outer rainbands began to cause flooding in river basins {{well in advance of}} the storm's landfall. Upon moving ashore Honshu, the typhoon brought a strong storm surge that destroyed numerous flood defense systems, inundating coastal regions and sinking ships. Damage totals from Vera reached US$600million (equivalent to US$ billion in [...] ). The number of fatalities caused by Vera remain <b>discrepant,</b> though current estimates indicate that the typhoon caused at least 4,000deaths, making it the deadliest typhoon in Japanese history.|$|E

500|$|The {{measured}} abundances {{all agree}} at least roughly with those predicted {{from a single}} value of the baryon-to-photon ratio. The agreement is excellent for deuterium, close but formally <b>discrepant</b> for , and off {{by a factor of}} two for in the latter two cases there are substantial systematic uncertainties. Nonetheless, the general consistency with abundances predicted by Big Bang nucleosynthesis is strong evidence for the Big Bang, as the theory is the only known explanation for the relative abundances of light elements, and {{it is virtually impossible to}} [...] "tune" [...] the Big Bang to produce much more or less than 20–30% helium. Indeed, there is no obvious reason outside of the Big Bang that, for example, the young universe (i.e., before star formation, as determined by studying matter supposedly free of stellar nucleosynthesis products) should have more helium than deuterium or more deuterium than , and in constant ratios, too.|$|E

[...] Matching new registrants' information against Ohio Bureau of Motor Vehicles or the Social Security Administration databases is one of the requirements. Challenges to mismatched registrations, which force the use of provisional ballots, must be filed twenty days prior to the election. Legal expert Greta Van Susteren viewed the ruling as a significant breaking news story and interviewed Brunner on her show On the Record w/ Greta Van Susteren the day it was made. Van Susteren interpreted the ruling as a statement that Brunner has not been taking sufficient steps to prevent voter fraud. [...] Democracy Now! also interviewed Brunner on that day, but they did so before the final verdict.|$|E

2500|$|Esuno's art and its {{adequacy}} to {{a horror}} series received very <b>discrepant</b> opinions. Garrity commented the {{art is not}} [...] "horrific" [...] and that [...] "most of the art is flat and generic, with vaguely cute big-eyed characters, bland backgrounds and a paucity of detail". However, [...] "horrific" [...] was precisely the word use by Gaffney to describe it, and Davisson wrote he has not [...] "seen anyone draw horror as well as Esuno". Zimmerman affirmed it is [...] "downright creep at times", and Sherman found [...] "some effective visuals" [...] like for the kuchisake-onna. Scott Green of Ain't It Cool News, who said Esuno [...] "isn't great at horror", praised the same scene and pondered that large-scale panels like those [...] "manage [...] some creepy spectacles". More consensual was that Esuno's monsters were better drawn his human characters. For example, Zoth praised backgrounds and monsters but called human designs [...] "generic and unmemorable" [...] and that [...] "looks to be a half-finished state." [...] Henderson said, [...] "It's fairly average in the portrayal of the humans, but the monsters are ... creepy and sometimes downright disturbing". Santos commended Esuno's [...] "striking supernatural imagery" [...] as exemplified by how [...] "classic creatures ... take on new levels of terrifying". He also praised its [...] "straightforward paneling [...] brings the story to the forefront and minimizes distractions", but he said [...] "some of the character designs look like {{the work of a}} rookie". Zimmerman asserted that [...] "though not quite as polished as fans have come to expect, [...] is fitting with his otherworldy designs and outlandish characters." [...] More negative was Wildsmith who called the art [...] "ordinary: cute character types clash with uninspired horror images". More positive was Sizemore, saying mood and emotions are well conveyed, and monsters are well crafted.|$|E

Others suggest so late a date as the wooing of Anne of Denmark by James VI. Nothing is known. No wonder, then, that in time an orally preserved ballad grows rich in variants.
