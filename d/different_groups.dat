5|$|As {{interactions}} between proteins are reversible, and depend {{heavily on the}} availability of <b>different</b> <b>groups</b> of partner proteins to form aggregates that are capable to carry out discrete sets of function, study of the {{interactions between}} specific proteins is a key to understand important aspects of cellular function, and ultimately the properties that distinguish particular cell types.|$|E
5|$|Some {{two hundred}} years later in 1891, the Russian {{crystallographer}} Yevgraf Fyodorov proved that every periodic tiling of the plane features one of seventeen <b>different</b> <b>groups</b> of isometries. Fyodorov's work marked the unofficial beginning of the mathematical study of tessellations. Other prominent contributors include Shubnikov and Belov (1964), and Heinrich Heesch and Otto Kienzle (1963).|$|E

5|$|A central {{topic of}} Leontovych's work is choral music about {{everyday}} life. His music frequently reflect actual actions and events. An {{example of this}} is his shchedrivka “Ой там за горою” (Oh there behind the mountain) in which a tenor initially starts the song with a solo {{and the rest of the}} voices of the choir gradually come in, reflecting carolling when new groups of singers join in. Then, a switching of parts begins between <b>different</b> <b>groups</b> of the choir, recreating the clamorous atmosphere of the New Year's Eve.|$|E

5|$|Calhoun's basic {{concern for}} {{protecting}} the diversity of minority interests is expressed in his chief contribution to political science—the idea of a concurrent majority across <b>different</b> <b>groups</b> as distinguished from a numerical majority.

5|$|In as <b>different</b> <b>groups</b> as {{animals and}} trypanosomes, the {{mitochondria}} contain both stabilising and destabilising poly(A) tails. Destabilising polyadenylation targets both mRNA and noncoding RNAs. The poly(A) tails are 43 nucleotides long on average. The stabilising ones {{start at the}} stop codon, and without them the stop codon (UAA) is not complete as the genome only encodes the U or UA part. Plant mitochondria have only destabilising polyadenylation, and yeast mitochondria have no polyadenylation at all.|$|E

A total of 32 Japanese personnel were killed around Victoria, and another 11 were killed at the airfield. Three Americans and two Australians were killed in these engagements.|$|E
5|$|Many {{bird species}} migrate to take {{advantage}} of global differences of seasonal temperatures, therefore optimising availability of food sources and breeding habitat. These migrations vary among the <b>different</b> <b>groups.</b> Many landbirds, shorebirds, and waterbirds undertake annual long distance migrations, usually triggered by the length of daylight as well as weather conditions. These birds are characterised by a breeding season spent in the temperate or polar regions and a non-breeding season in the tropical regions or opposite hemisphere. Before migration, birds substantially increase body fats and reserves and reduce the size of some of their organs.|$|E

In this case, a clustered group structure can result in slow movement, especially in a constrained area. It is the belief of this paper that modeling group structures can lead to more realistic crowd behavior simulations, and mod-eling group structures can facilitate the understanding of the effect of grouping on crowd behavior...|$|R

5|$|On occasion, {{groups of}} {{unrelated}} juveniles are observed. River otters living in groups hunt and travel together, {{use the same}} dens, resting sites, and latrines, and perform allogrooming. In freshwater systems, groups occur most often in autumn and during early winter. From mid-winter through the breeding season, adult females move and den alone. River otters are not territorial, but individual otters of <b>different</b> <b>groups</b> portray mutual avoidance. Home ranges of males are larger than those of females, and both sexes exhibit intra- and intersexual overlap of their domains.|$|E
5|$|Once {{regarded}} as plants constituting the class Schizomycetes, bacteria are now classified as prokaryotes. Unlike cells {{of animals and}} other eukaryotes, bacterial cells do not contain a nucleus and rarely harbour membrane-bound organelles. Although the term bacteria traditionally included all prokaryotes, the scientific classification changed after the discovery in the 1990s that prokaryotes consist of two very <b>different</b> <b>groups</b> of organisms that evolved from an ancient common ancestor. These evolutionary domains are called Bacteria and Archaea.|$|E
5|$|Overlordship was {{a central}} feature of Anglo-Saxon {{politics}} which began before Æthelberht's time; kings were described as overlords {{as late as the}} ninth century. The Anglo-Saxon invasion may have involved military coordination of <b>different</b> <b>groups</b> within the invaders, with a leader who had authority over many different groups; Ælle of Sussex may have been such a leader. Once the new states began to form, conflicts among them began. Tribute from dependents could lead to wealth. A weaker state also might ask or pay for the protection of a stronger neighbour against a warlike third state.|$|E

5|$|RNA viruses: Replication {{usually takes}} place in the cytoplasm. RNA viruses can be placed into four <b>different</b> <b>groups</b> {{depending}} on their modes of replication. The polarity (whether or not it can be used directly by ribosomes to make proteins) of single-stranded RNA viruses largely determines the replicative mechanism; the other major criterion is whether the genetic material is single-stranded or double-stranded. All RNA viruses use their own RNA replicase enzymes to create copies of their genomes.|$|E

5|$|Three main {{camouflage}} methods predominate in the oceans: transparency, reflection, and counterillumination. Transparency and reflectivity {{are most}} important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counterillumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres. Most animals of the open sea use {{at least one of}} these methods to camouflage themselves. Camouflage in relatively shallow waters is more like terrestrial camouflage, where additional methods are used by animals in many <b>different</b> <b>groups.</b> These methods of camouflage are described in turn below.|$|E
