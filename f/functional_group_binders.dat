40|$|This {{research}} studies {{the development of}} hybrid binder by using {{two different types of}} binder which are cassava starch and epoxy resin. The cassava starch and epoxy resins were blended to produce a hybrid binder which is more environmental friendly, cassava starch was chosen because of good ductility, good adhesion, self-curing and hygroscopicity resistance while epoxy resin has high elastic modulus, low creep, low density, strong bond ability, good electrical insulation properties, chemical resistance, convenient manufacturing process and good performance at elevated temperature. The aims of this study were to prepare the hybrid binder based on epoxy resin with different concentration of cassava starch, to characterize the <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> of hybrid <b>binder</b> and to evaluate the effect of cassava starch concentration in hybrid binder on the tensile, impact and bending test. FTIR result shows the spectral patterns of all samples are approximately similar. Mechanical properties were tested by using tensile, impact and bending test. The hybrid binder with 20...|$|R

However, LiMn 2 O 4 spinel electrodes severely degrade at high temperature due to Mn dissolution. Also, the dissolved Mn 2 + ions causes self-discharge where reduction of Mn 2 + ions into Mn metals occurs on a graphite anode surface accompanied by oxidation of lithiated graphite at a charged state, and this results in severe capacity fading at high temperature. In this study, ion-exchangeable binders and a separator having <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> of sodium carboxylate or sulfonate are, for the first time, examined to solve the Mn dissolution problem of LiMn 2 O 4 spinel materials at high temperature. Ion exchange between Na+ ions of the <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> of the <b>binders</b> and the separator and dissolved Mn 2 + ions of the LiMn 2 O 4 electrodes inhibits self-discharge, resulting in improved cycle performance.

40|$|In this study, Neural Network (NN) {{model is}} {{developed}} to quantify nano-level adhesion force of moisture damaged asphalt binder using Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) test data. AFM data contains five point force-distance values determined for some specific asphalt chemical <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> Asphalt <b>binder</b> samples contain different types and percentages of polymer modifiers and antistripping agents (ASA). Due to complex and nonlinear {{interaction between the}} asphalt properties and adhesion force of asphalt, {{it is difficult to}} assess the effects of asphalt binder properties on the adhesion forces using laboratory AFM testing. NN has the ability to recognize and trace the complex relationship trend existing between inputs and outputs; therefore NN is chosen to be used {{for the development of the}} model in this study. Two neural network models are developed, one for lime treated and another for chemical antistripping agent treated asphalt samples. To train the network, AFM tip-sample distance data, percentage of lime, type and percentage of polymer and asphalt chemical <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> are considered as inputs and AFM force as an output. On the basis of performance, 12 - 9 - 16 - 3 and 11 - 25 - 25 - 5 NN are selected as the final structure of models for lime and chemical antistripping agents treated asphalt samples respectively. The models show good agreement with the laboratory data for both models. To this end, the developed models are used to predict adhesion of both lime treated and chemical antistripping agents treated dry and wet asphalt for same inputs. This allows observing the effect of lime and chemical additives in resisting adhesion loss due to moisture conditioning thus moisture damage of bond forces of asphalt. NN induced results show that lime performs better in resisting moisture effect for samples containing 3 % SB polymer compared to other polymer modified samples. Also, lime fails to resist the degradation of adhesion force in wet sample determined by silicon nitride tip for all types of modified asphalt samples. Among all the chemical ASAs, Morlife shows best performance in presence of 3 % SB and 3 and 5 % SBS in reducing moisture effect on adhesion and cohesion bond forces of asphalt at nano-level. In all cases, increase in percentage of additives above 1 % does not aid in resistance to moisture damage. National Science FoundationCivil EngineeringMastersUniversity of New Mexico.

40|$|Plant {{diversity}} {{has been}} shown to increase community biomass in experimental communities, but the mechanisms resulting in such positive biodiversity effects have remained largely unknown. We used a large-scale six-year biodiversity experiment near Jena, Germany, to examine how aboveground community biomass in grasslands is affected by different components of plant diversity and thereby infer the mechanisms that may underlie positive biodiversity effects. As components of diversity we defined the number of species (1 – 16), number of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> (1 – 4), presence of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> (legumes, tall herbs, small herbs, and grasses) and proportional abundance of <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> Using linear models, replacement series on the level of <b>functional</b> <b>groups,</b> and additive partitioning on the level of species, we explored whether the observed biodiversity effects originated from disproportionate effects of single <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> or species or from positive interactions between them. Aboveground community biomass was positively related to the number of species measured across <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> {{as well as to the}} number of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> measured across different levels of species richness. Furthermore, increasing the number of species within <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> increased aboveground community biomass, indicating that species within <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> were not redundant with respect to biomass production. A positive relationship between the number of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> and aboveground community biomass within a particular level of species richness suggested that complementarity was larger between species belonging to different rather than to the same <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> The presence of legumes or tall herbs had a strong positive impact on aboveground community biomass whereas the presence of small herbs or grasses had on average no significant effect. Two- and three-way interactions between <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> presences were weak, suggesting that their main effects were largely additive.

These fractions include fossil fuel combustion emissions, biomass burning emissions and secondary organic aerosol (SOA). Results clearly highlight the differences between <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> fingerprints of primary and secondary OA fractions. OA emitted from primary sources {{is found to be}} moderately functionalized, as about 20 carbons per 1000 bear one of the <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> determined here, whereas SOA is much more functionalized, as in average 94 carbons per 1000 bear a <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> under study. Aging processes appear to increase both RCOOH and RCOR' <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> contents by nearly one order of magnitude. Conversely, RNO 2 content is found to decrease with photochemical processes. Finally, our results also suggest that other <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> significantly contribute to biomass smoke and SOA.

A thorough examination of our data suggests that this remaining unexplained oxygen content can be most probably assigned to alcohol (ROH), organic peroxides (ROOH), organonitrates (RONO 2) and/or organosulfates (ROSO 3 H).
