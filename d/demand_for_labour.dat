There were large warehouses at Skippool and Wardleys, owned by linen merchants from Kirkham. By the 19thcentury, craftsmen in Poulton were {{an important part of}} the industry. In the early part of the 19thcentury, there was a significant decline in the craft industries because of increased mechanisation, as well as increased <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>labour.</b> In contrast to neighbouring Kirkham, Poulton appeared to suffer from a lack of enthusiasm for new industrial techniques and opportunities among its industry leaders.|$|E
5|$|British rule in Nyasaland radically {{altered the}} local {{indigenous}} power structures. The early colonial period saw some immigration and settlement by white colonists, who bought large swathes of territory from local chiefs, often for token payments in beads or guns. Most {{of the land}} acquired, particularly in the Shire Highlands, was converted into white-owned plantations where tea, coffee, cotton and tobacco were grown. The enforcement of colonial institutions, such as the Hut Tax, compelled many indigenous people to find paid work and the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>labour</b> created by the plantations, led to their becoming a major employer. Once employed on the plantations, black workers found that they were frequently beaten and subject to racial discrimination. Increasingly, the plantations were also forced {{to rely on a}} system of forced labour or corvée, known locally at the thangata.|$|E

5|$|The {{economic}} {{importance of}} Gibraltar changed following {{the invention of}} steamships; {{the first one to}} reach Gibraltar's harbour arrived there in 1823. The advent of steamships caused a major shift in trade patterns in the Mediterranean. Transshipment, which had previously been Gibraltar's principal economic mainstay, was largely replaced by the much less lucrative work of servicing visiting steamships through coaling, victualling and ferrying of goods. Although Gibraltar became a key coaling station where British steamships refuelled on the way to Alexandria or Cape Horn, the economic changes resulted in a prolonged depression that lasted until {{near the end of the}} century. The <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>labour</b> for coaling was such that Gibraltar instituted the practice of relying on large numbers of imported Spanish workers. A shanty town sprang up on the site of the old Spanish fortifications just across the border, which became the workers' town of La Línea de la Concepción. The poor economy meant that Gibraltar's population barely changed between 1830 and 1880, but it was still relatively more prosperous than the severely impoverished south of Spain. As a consequence, La Línea's population doubled over the same period and then doubled again in the following 20 years.|$|E

25|$|Wages do {{not fall}} enough during recessions to prevent {{unemployment}} from rising. If the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>labour</b> falls, this lowers wages. But because wages have fallen, {{the probability of}} 'shirking' (workers not exerting effort) has risen. If employment levels are to be maintained, through a sufficient lowering of wages, workers will be less productive than before through the shirking effect. As a consequence, in the model, wages do not fall enough to maintain employment levels at the previous state, because firms want to avoid excessive shirking by their workers. So, unemployment must rise during recessions, because wages are kept 'too high'.|$|E

Both the Organisation Todt and the Labour Service were characteristically paramilitary in hierarchy and appearance, with elaborate sets of chevrons, armbands and epaulettes, and other insignia for the display and recognition of rank.

40|$|In {{recent decades}} {{the forces of}} {{structural}} change and technological change, have had considerable influence increasing the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> skilled <b>labour</b> in Australia. In addition, while experiencing a full cycle, Australia has also enjoyed 2 decades of positive economic growth, from the recession in the early 1990 s to the economic boom of 2006. While the 1990 s recession focused attention on the unemployment problem, the boom concentrated attention on skill shortages in Australia and their role in preventing the economy from reaching its full potential level of output and putting pressure on inflation. Overall, these forces have combined to significantly increase the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> skilled <b>labour</b> in Australia. Here we examine {{the extent to which}} the market <b>for</b> skilled <b>labour</b> has adjusted to changed economic conditions. This includes changes in the supply of skilled labour, internal movement and migration, the role of earnings and rates of return to tertiary education and training. The evidence presented in this thesis suggests growth in the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> domestic skilled <b>labour</b> has outstripped the growth in supply of skilled labour. Overall, it appears the Australian labour market has generally adjusted satisfactorily to changes in the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> skilled <b>labour</b> with the help of skilled migrants from overseas. This analysis has policy relevance with respect to skilled migration, inequality, education and training as well as contributing to knowledge of the labour market impacts of the business cycle...|$|R

Following the {{invasion}} of Poland Todt was named the Minister for Armaments and Munitions in 1940 (Reichminister für Bewaffnung und Munition) and the projects of the OT group became almost exclusively military. The huge increase in the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>labour</b> created by the various military and paramilitary projects was met by a series of expansions of the laws on compulsory service, which ultimately obligated all Germans to arbitrarily determined (i.e., effectively unlimited) compulsory labour for the state: Zwangsarbeit. From 1938–40, over 1.75 million Germans were conscripted into labour service. From 1940–42, Organization Todt began its reliance on Gastarbeitnehmer (guest workers), Militärinternierte (military internees), Zivilarbeiter (civilian workers), Ostarbeiter (Eastern workers) and Hilfswillige ("volunteer") POW workers.|$|E
25|$|The {{full title}} of the {{legislation}} was “An Ordinance to Regulate the Position of Natives residing on Private Estates, (No 14 of 1928)” and it was normally called the Natives on Private Estates Ordinance, 1928. The Ordinance created a class of registered “Resident Natives”, who had entered into tenancy agreements: only these and their families {{had the right to}} live on the private estate of their tenancy for the term of their lease. Male children of residents lost the right to live on estates at 16 years old, and owners could refuse to allow the husband of a resident’s daughter to settle. Every registered tenant, except the elderly or widows, had to pay a rent which could be satisfied in cash, by labour or by giving produce to the owner. From 1928, District Rent Boards fixed maximum cash rents: most chose a rate of £1 for an 8 acre tenant’s plot although some estates charged less. The Boards also designated acceptable crops (mainly tobacco or cotton, sometimes maize) and fixed the amounts equivalent to rents. The required value of crops was between 30 and 50 shillings instead of £1 cash, particularly penalising maize to discourage tenants from this option. A Land Commission of 1903 reported that normal annual rent and Hut tax burden of tenants was six shillings, and from 1911 there was the option of providing fixed amounts of tobacco or cotton. However, estate owners expected that there tenants would work for at least two months rather than pay rent in cash or kind. As the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>labour</b> increased, owners refused to accept cash so the rent of six shillings, which remained virtually unchanged for other two decades before 1928, was purely nominal. By 1928, the value of the several months’ labour actually provided was roughly £1. The owners of estates over 10,000 acres would be allowed to expel up to 10% of their tenants in 1933 (and every five years thereafter) without showing any cause: those expelled were to be re-settled on Crown Lands. There was provision for future compulsory purchase of up to 10% of estates over 10,000 acres as a last resort, if no Crown Lands were available.|$|E

2500|$|... "A {{circumstance}} which has, perhaps, {{more than}} any other, contributed to conceal this oscillation from common view, {{is the difference between}} the nominal and real price of labour. It very rarely happens that the nominal price of labour universally falls; but we well know that it frequently remains the same, while the nominal price of provisions has been gradually rising. This, indeed, will generally be the case, if the increase of manufactures and commerce be sufficient to employ the new labourers that are thrown into the market, and to prevent the increased supply from lowering the money-price. But an increased number of labourers receiving the same money-wages will necessarily, by their competition, increase the money-price of corn. This is, in fact, a real fall in the price of labour; and, during this period, the condition of the lower classes of the community must be gradually growing worse. But the farmers and capitalists are growing rich from the real cheapness of labour. Their increasing capitals enable them to employ a greater number of men; and, as the population had probably suffered some check from the greater difficulty of supporting a family, the <b>demand</b> <b>for</b> <b>labour,</b> after a certain period, would be great in proportion to the supply, and its price would of course rise, if left to find its natural level; and thus the wages of labour, and consequently the condition of the lower classes of society, might have progressive and retrograde movements, though the price of labour might never nominally fall.|$|E
