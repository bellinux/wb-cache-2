40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{demonstrated that}} Fusarium oxysporum (Fo), {{which is not}} pathogenic to cucumbers, {{could serve as a}} biological control agent for managing <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> <b>cucumber</b> caused by Fo f. sp. cucumerinum (Foc) in Taiwan. However, thus far it has not been possible to separate the populations of pathogenic Fo from the nonpathogenic isolates that have biological control potential through their morphological characteristics. Although these two populations can be distinguished from one another using a bioassay, the work is laborious and time-consuming. In this study, a fragment of the intergenic spacer (IGS) region of ribosomal DNA from an Fo biological control agent, Fo 366, was PCR-amplified with published general primers, FIGS 11 /FIGS 12 and sequenced. A new primer, NPIGS-R, which was designed based on the IGS sequence, was paired with the FIGS 11 primer. These primers were then evaluated for their specificity to amplify DNA from nonpathogenic Fo isolates that have biological control potential. The results showed that the modified primer pair, FIGS 11 /NPIGS-R, amplified a 500 -bp DNA fragment from five of seven nonpathogenic Fo isolates. These five Fo isolates delayed symptom development of cucumber Fusarium wilt in greenhouse bioassay tests. Seventy-seven Fo isolates were obtained from the soil and plant tissues and then subjected to amplification using the modified primer pair; six samples showed positive amplification. These six isolates did not cause symptoms on cucumber seedlings when grown in peat moss infested with the isolates and delayed disease development when the same plants were subsequently inoculated with a virulent isolate of Foc. Therefore, the modified primer pair may prove useful for the identification of Fo isolates that are nonpathogenic to cucumber which can potentially act as biocontrol agents for <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> <b>cucumber...</b>|$|E

Thereafter, a sample of antagonistic microbial Material A (mixture of selected antagonistic Actinomycetes and organic matter, compost made of photosynthetic bacterial sludge: CPBS) was prepared and tested for its antagonistic activity to F. oxysporum and the fixation rate in soil. 1. Compost made of photosynthetic bacterial sludge (CPBS) was selected as an organic material which promotes th Actinomycetes activity in soil. 2. Antagonistic effect of Material A on radish yellows and <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> <b>cucumber</b> caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. raphani and f. sp. cucumerinum was observed.

40|$|Biocontrol {{strategies}} using organic substrates such as wood {{fibers and}} biocontrol agents such as Trichoderma are currently developed to control soil pathogens such as Fusarium oxysporum. Nonetheless, such biocontrol methods give discording results, notably because microbial communities of organic substrates actually are not taken into account. Therefore, {{there is a}} lack of information concerning the variability of microbial composition related to the organic substrate type. Here we studied peat, wood and coir fibers, that are substrates known for their different biocontrol efficiency against <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> <b>cucumber.</b> We analyzed in microcosms the microbial composition of wood fibers, coir fibers and peat, incubated up to 60 days, by using an amplicon-sequencing approach based on 16 S rRNA gene for bacteria and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) for fungi. Diversity was assessed by sequencing the 16 S rRNA for bacteria and ITS 2 region for fungi. Results showed that bacterial richness was threefold higher for coir fiber and peat than for wood fiber. Fungal richness was three times higher for wood and coir fibers compared to peat. Bacterial and fungal patterns showed a dominance of alpha- and gamma- Proteobacteria and Sordariomycetes for coir fiber; beta- and gamma-Proteobacteria and Eurotiomycetes for wood fibers; Flavobacteria, Leotiomycetes and Sordariomycetes for peat. In conclusion, results show that substrates have different microbial composition. Finally, for a proper use of a biocontrol strategy is important to take into account the type of substrate...|$|E
40|$|Fusarium Bosporus f. sp. cucumerinum is the fungal {{pathogen}} {{responsible for}} <b>Fusarium</b> vascular <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> <b>cucumber.</b> The options for managing <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> in greenhouse cucumbers {{are limited by}} our poor understanding of the modes of survival and dissemination of the pathogen. Aerial dissemination of the pathogen was investigated following {{the development of a}} highly specific and sensitive quantitative real-time PCR assay that reliably detected as few as 100 Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum genome copies in environmental matrices. Numbers of both macroconidia and microconidia were variable in greenhouse air samples at different times of day. A potential relationship between fluctuation in relative humidity and spore number was found. While this shows that the pathogen can be aerially disseminated, airborne spores were unable to infect wound stem sites. These results suggest that aerial inoculum propagates and disseminates the pathogen, but that infection is primarily through the root after aerial spores are deposited on the soil surface. Aerial dissemination was also found to occur through insect vectors. Sciarid and shore flies could carry between 1 × 102 and 1 × 106 pathogen genome copies/individual. Experimentally, sciarid and shore flies acquired F. oxysporum f. sp. cucumerinum following exposures to agar cultures of the pathogen of up to 94 hours and were found to transfer the pathogen, resulting in disease expression in a glasshouse transmission trial...|$|R

Whereas BA and PM improved almost all physico-chemical properties of the soil evaluated, seed treatment with P. indica had no such effect. In shake culture in potato dextrose broth (PDB) medium amended with aqueous extracts of BA and PM, alone or in combination, production mycelial mass of Fo was significantly decreased by PM extract, while production mycelial mass of P. indica was highly improved. The colonization rate <b>of</b> <b>cucumber</b> roots by P. indica as determined by microscopy was highly increased by increasing amounts of BA, PM and BA+PM added to the soil. Seed treatment <b>of</b> <b>cucumber</b> with P. indica before plant cultivation in non-amended soil significantly decreased the disease severity of FW and improved plant growth. When seed treated with P. indica was sown into soil amended with BA, PM or the combination of both, the disease severity was even more reduced than after seed treatment with P. indica alone. In this respect, amendment with PM was more effective than with BA, and the combinations were more effective than the single treatments.

Kanto et al. (2006) reported that both potassium silicate and calcium silicate suppressed <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> <b>cucumber</b> for 3 [*]years more than sodium silicate. They tested liquid potassium silicate as soil drench to control the powdery mildew of strawberry in the soil {{and found that the}} soluble potassium silicate suppressed the powdery mildew disease more efficiently as a protective control than as a control to diminish initial incidence. Also, they measured silicate-treated leaves and found that leaves treated by silicate were harder than control leaves. Moreover, Jayawardana et al. (2014) reported that the root and the foliar application of soluble silicon as potassium silicate caused decrease in disease incidence and increase in plant growth and fruit quality parameters. Weerahewa and David (2015) tested tomato cultivars “Thilina” and “Maheshi” by soil application of silicon at 0, 50, and 100 [*]mg/l during the growth stage, flowering stage, and both growth and flowering stages to control anthracnose. They reported a reduction of lesions by 80 % in “Maheshi” and 87 % in “Thilina,” respectively. In this vein, Cherif and Belanger (1992) evaluated amendment with potassium silicate as means to control Pythium ultimum infection on cucumber and reported that supplying the solutions with 100 or 200 [*]ppm of potassium silicate significantly reduced plant mortality, root decay, and yield losses attributed to the infection. Furthermore, Rodrigues et al. (2003, 2010) suggested that potassium silicate sprays could reduce the intensity of angular leaf spot on beans. Liang et al. (2005) noticed that silicon can prevent pathogen penetration into host tissues. Reduction in disease incidence in plants treated with silicon sources under field conditions is not probably due to the fungi-static effects of silicon, but silicon could act as physical barrier against pathogen penetration or it can be used as inducer for defense response in plants (Shen et al. 2010).|$|E

Possible mechanisms were examined in field, greenhouse, and in vitro experiments. The effects of cover crop treatments (V. villosa, Trifolium incarnatum, Secale cereale, Brassica juncea) and the biocontrol treatment Actinovate (Streptomyces lydicus WYEC 108) on <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> watermelon and its causal pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. niveum (FON) were evaluated. In four of five field experiments there were significant elevations in soil microbial respiration. Arbuscular mycorrhizal colonization of watermelon roots following cover crop amendments of V. villosa and T. incarnatum, were significantly higher compared to bare ground. The elevation in respiration was significantly positively correlated with disease suppression <b>of</b> <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> induced by V. villosa and T. incarnatum (both cover crops reduced <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> as much as 21 %). In greenhouse experiments using infested field soil, <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> suppression was observed in pots amended with V. villosa and T. incarnatum. However, {{there was an increase}} in <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> watermelon in pots that were amended with V. villosa and T. incarnatum which were also inoculated with FON when compared to plants in nonamended, inoculated pots. These leguminous cover crops may have served as a nutrient source for the pathogen. In addition, in vitro growth experiments showed that media amended with V. villosa leachate significantly stimulated the in vitro growth rates of FON and Trichoderma harzianum compared to nonamended plates. It was hypothesized that V. villosa stimulation of nonpathogenic F. oxysporum spp., which provides cross protection against FON, {{may have contributed to the}} wilt suppression. Cover crop leachate amendments did not significantly influence colony forming units of S. lydicus. In both field and greenhouse trials Actinovate applications either had little or no effect on <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> watermelon.

Since this first discovery, the pathogen, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. lactucae (Fol), has been recovered from infected lettuce plants from approximately 30 different fields. This fungus is a soil-borne pathogen that can remain viable in soil for many years. Cultural disease control measures, such as extended soil flooding and soil solarization, have shown promise in managing <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> in other cropping systems. The specific objectives {{of this research}} were to repeat preliminary soil solarization and flooding experiments conducted last year and to evaluate the effect of preplant treatment of planting beds with either Vapam or soil solarization on the subsequent incidence <b>of</b> <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> on lettuce. In a microplot study, soil naturally infested with Fol was flooded or solarized for 15, 30, 45 and 60 days, then bioassayed by transplanting and growing lettuce plants in samples of treated soil as well as nontreated soil. In field studies, plots were solarized for 40 days or treated with Vapam before planting to lettuce. In the microplot experiment, the severity <b>of</b> <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> on lettuce grown in previously flooded or solarized soil was significantly less than that in nontreated soil. Additionally, {{there was no difference}} between flooding and solarization with respect to disease severity, as lettuce plants in both cases had virtually no symptoms <b>of</b> <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt.</b> Weight <b>of</b> the tops of lettuce plants was significantly greater for plants grown in flooded or solarized soil compared to that in nontreated soil.

40|$|Selected {{isolates}} of Pseudomonas fluorescens (Pf 4 - 92 and PfRsC 5) and P. aeruginosa (PaRsG 18 and PaRsG 27) {{were examined}} for growth promotion and induced systemic resistance against <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> chickpea. Significant increase in plant height {{was observed in}} Pseudomonas treated plants. However, plant growth was inhibited when isolates of Pseudomonas were used in combination with Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. ciceri (FocRs 1). It was also observed that the Pseudomonas spp. was colonized in root of chickpea and significantly suppressed the disease in greenhouse condition. Rock wool bioassay technique was used to study the effect of iron availability on the induction of systemic resistance to <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> chickpea mediated by the Pseudomonas spp. All the isolates of Pseudomonas spp. showed greater disease control in the induced systemic resistance (ISR) bioassay when iron availability in the nutrient solution was low. High performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis indicated that all the bacterial isolates produced more salicylic acid (SA) at low iron (10 µM EDDHA) than high iron availability (10 µFe 3 + EDDHA). Except PaRsG 27, all the three isolates produced more pseudobactin at low iron than high iron availability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> {{zucchini}} in Jeonju, Korea, {{was first}} noticed in May 2013. Symptoms included <b>wilting</b> <b>of</b> the foliage, drying and withering of older leaves, and stunting of plants. Infected plants eventually died during growth. Based on morphological characteristics and phylogenetic {{analyses of the}} molecular markers (internal transcribed spacer rDNA and translation elongation factor 1 α), the fungus was identified as Fusarium oxysporum. Pathogenicity of a representative isolate was demonstrated via artificial inoculation, and it satisfied Koch’s postulates.

40|$|<b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt,</b> {{caused by}} <b>Fusarium</b> oxysporum f. sp. cubense (Foc), {{is one of}} the most {{destructive}} diseases of banana. One potential method to manage <b>fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> banana is by manipulating the nutrient status in the soil. This study was conducted to determine the quality of Foc suppressive and conducive soil, the influence of soil application of silica and manure on the incidence <b>of</b> <b>fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> banana. Surveys were conducted in five banana plantations in three provinces in Indonesia: Lampung-Sumatra, West Java and Central Java. From the five locations, one location (Sala-man-Central Java) was heavily infected by Foc, another location (NTF Lampung-Sumatera) was slightly infected by Foc, while the rest (Sarampad-West Java, Talaga-West Java and GGP Lampung-Sumatra) were healthy banana plantations without Foc infection. Labile carbon analysis showed that the Foc suppressive soil had greater labile carbon content than conducive soil. Also, the analysis of fluorescein diacetate hydrolysis (FDA) and ?-glucosidase showed greater microbial activity in suppressive soil than the conducive soil. Observations of the incidence of necrotic rhizome of Foc susceptible 'Ambon Kuning' (AAA) banana cultivar showed that in the suppressive soil taken from Sarampad West Java, the application of silica and manure helped suppress <b>fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> disease development. In the conducive soil taken from Salaman-Central Java, silica and manure applications were not able to suppress disease incidence. The result of this study indicated that in suppressive soil, the application of silica can increase plant resistance to Foc infection, while manure application can increase soil microbial activity, and suppress Foc development...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogen}} of Fusarium oxysporum in the Artemisia selengens continuously cropped soil infects seedlings {{from the}} incision of the cutting stem, which causes <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> <b>of</b> A. selengens seedlings and decreases the survival {{ratio of the}} seedlings. This study isolated biocontrol microorganisms and developed a bioorganic fertilizer for biocontrol <b>of</b> the <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt.</b> The isolated bacterium was identified as Bacillus subtilis and coded D 9. The metabolites of the D 9 significantly inhibited the conidia germination and hypha elongation of the F. oxysporum. The disease incidence of control treatment was 91. 0 %. Organic fertilizer (OF) and D 9 bioorganic fertilizer (BOF) significantly decreased disease incidence <b>of</b> <b>Fusarium</b> <b>wilt</b> (P< 0. 05), and the biocontrol efficacy of OF treatment and BOF treatment was 77. 3 % and 97. 1 %, respectively. Adding OF and BOF in the soil significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased populations of F. oxysporum in the stem of A. selengens, and BOF significantly (P< 0. 05) decreased population of F. oxysporum in the rhizosphere soil. Population of F. oxysporum in the stem and rhizosphere soil of BOF treatment was decreased by 35. 7 % and 93. 7 % respectively, as compared with control treatment. OF demonstrated {{no effect on the}} activity of chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase of A. selengens, while BOF significantly (P< 0. 05) increased the activity of chitinase and β- 1, 3 -glucanase.
