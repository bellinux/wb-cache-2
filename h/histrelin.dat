50|$|<b>Histrelin</b> is used {{to treat}} hormone-sensitive cancers of the {{prostate}} in men and uterine fibroids in women. In addition, <b>histrelin</b> has been proven to be highly effective in treating central precocious puberty in children.|$|E
50|$|<b>Histrelin</b> acetate is a nonapeptide analog of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{with added}} potency. When {{present in the}} bloodstream, it acts on {{particular}} cells of the pituitary gland called gonadotropes. <b>Histrelin</b> stimulates these cells to release luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone. Thus it is considered a gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist or GnRH agonist.|$|E
50|$|In {{a process}} known as downregulation, daily {{stimulation}} of pituitary gonadotropes causes them to become desensitized to the effects of <b>histrelin.</b> As a consequence, levels of LH and FSH fall after a short period of time. From that point forward, as long as <b>histrelin</b> is administered, the levels of LH and FSH in the blood remain low.|$|E
50|$|<b>Histrelin</b> is marketed by Endo Pharmaceuticals {{under the}} brand names Vantas and Supprelin LA.|$|E
50|$|<b>Histrelin</b> is {{also part}} of the primary care {{protocol}} in transgender children/youth, and is used in suppressing cis-sex puberty, until the patient is ready to begin cross-sex hormonal therapy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Histrelin</b> is also {{available}} in a 12-month subcutaneous implant (Vantas) for the palliative treatment of advanced prostate cancer, since 2005 in the US, and since Jan 2010 in the UK.|$|E
50|$|The implant {{is a small}} tube {{containing}} <b>histrelin.</b> The implant {{needs to}} be replaced every year, and is implanted subcutaneously in the upper arm. The doctor makes a small cut in the anesthetized skin of the patient and then inserts the implant. The patient must be careful after the operation to keep the cut clean, dry, and to not move the bandage and the surgical strips or stitches used to close the incision on the skin. The drug is then gradually released in the body during 12 months {{and it has to}} be replaced by another one later to continue the treatment. The total cost of <b>histrelin</b> treatment with the surgery is $15,000.|$|E
50|$|This {{prolonged}} {{lowering of}} LH and FSH levels is {{the rationale for}} therapy using GnRH agonists. Since LH and FSH stimulate the gonads to produce estrogens and androgens in females and males respectively, <b>histrelin</b> can effectively be used to decrease the sex steroids {{in the blood of}} patients.|$|E
50|$|GnRH {{agonists}} are synthetically {{modeled after}} the natural GnRH decapeptide with specific modifications, typically in position 6 (amino acid substitution), 9 (alkylation) and 10 (deletion). These substitutions inhibit rapid degradation. Agonists with two substitutions include: leuprolide (Lupron, Eligard), buserelin (Suprefact, Suprecor), <b>histrelin</b> (Supprelin LA, Vantas), goserelin (Zoladex), and deslorelin (Suprelorin, Ovuplant). The agents nafarelin (Synarel) and triptorelin are agonists with single substitutions at position 6.|$|E
50|$|One {{possible}} {{treatment is}} with anastrozole. <b>Histrelin</b> acetate (Supprelin LA), triptorelin or leuprolide, any GnRH agonists, may be used. Non-continuous usage of GnRH agonists stimulates the pituitary gland to release {{follicle stimulating hormone}} (FSH) and luteinizing hormone (LH). However, when used regularly, GnRH agonists cause a decreased release of FSH and LH. Prolonged use has a risk of causing osteoporosis. After stopping GnRH agonists, pubertal changes resume within 3 to 12 months.|$|E
50|$|Transgender youth are a {{specific}} target population of puberty blockers. Children {{as young as}} two or three can exhibit signs of being transgender, and may qualify {{for the use of}} puberty blockers. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) agonists (e.g., leuprolide acetate, <b>histrelin)</b> to halt puberty, can be used for transgender youth before the development of natal secondary sex characteristics. Puberty blockers' effects are completely reversible, which alleviates controversy on the usage of puberty blockers for young children.|$|E
5000|$|There are two {{different}} medicines, LHRH agonists and antagonists, which both lower the amount of testosterone made by the testicles. They work inhibiting the formation of LH in the pituitary gland. The LHRH agonists produce a sudden increase on levels of testosterone followed by a huge falling, process called flare, whereas LHRH antagonists decrease directly the amount of testosterone. Some {{of the most common}} LHRH agonist and antagonist active substances are leuprolide, goserelin, triptorelin, <b>histrelin</b> and degarelix.|$|E
40|$|Katherine A Lewis, Erica A EugsterDepartment of Pediatrics, Indiana University School of Medicine, Riley Hospital for Children, Indianapolis, USAAbstract: In 2007, a {{hydrogel}} <b>histrelin</b> implant {{was approved}} {{for the treatment}} of children with central precocious puberty (CPP). Children with CPP commonly have reduced height potential due to premature closure of the epiphyseal growth plates from exposure to sex steroids. Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) treatment halts puberty and allows for improvement of adult height. A hydrogel implant delivery system utilizing the potent GnRHa, <b>histrelin,</b> was first developed for use in men with prostate cancer.

Studies to date have demonstrated safety, tolerability, and effectiveness of this treatment option in patients treated up to 2 years. The most common adverse effects of the implant relate to implant site pain or bruising. Cost of this treatment seems comparable to somewhat higher than the commonly used GnRHa treatment option, depot leuprolide.

40|$|The <b>histrelin</b> implant {{has emerged}} as a {{therapeutic}} option for the treatment of central precocious puberty that has been favorably received by patients and providers. Inserted subcutaneously, the 50 -mg implant provides continuous release of the potent gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog (GnRHa) <b>histrelin.</b> Profound suppression of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal (HPG) axis occurs within 1 month of its placement resulting in pubertal arrest, attenuation of skeletal advancement and a progressive increase in predicted adult height.

Materials and Methods. Retrospective data collected over a six-year period at a single center from charts of 113 patients who received the subcutaneous abdominal <b>histrelin</b> acetate implant. Results. Following insertion of the first implant, 92. 1 % and 91. 8 % of patients had a serum testosterone level of ≤ 30 [*]ng/dL at 24 and 48 weeks, respectively. Serum testosterone levels remained at < 30 [*]ng/dL for 96 % of patients at two years and for 100 % of patients at 3, 4, and 5 years. The testosterone levels remained significantly less than baseline (P< 0. 05). Six patients (5. 3 %) had androgen-independent progression when followed up on the long term, increasing the mean serum PSA at 3, 4, and 5 years to 35. 0 [*]µg/L (n= 22), 30. 7 [*]µg/L (n= 13), and 132. 9 [*]µg/L (n= 8), respectively.

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The <b>histrelin</b> implant {{has proven}} to be an {{effective}} method of delivering GnRH analog (GnRHa) therapy to children with central precocious puberty (CPP), yet there are limited data available regarding hormonal suppression and auxological changes during an extended course of therapy. DESIGN: This was a phase 3, prospective, open-label study. SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: Thirty-six children with CPP who participated in a phase 3, open-label study and required further GnRHa therapy were eligible to continue treatment receiving a new implant upon removal of the prior 12 -month <b>histrelin</b> implant during a long-term extension phase. OUTCOME MEASURES: Hormone levels and auxologic parameters were measured periodically for up to 6 years of treatment and up to 1 year of posttreatment follow-up. RESULTS: Hormonal suppression was maintained throughout the study in patients who had prior GnRHa therapy (n = 16) and in treatment-naive patients (n = 20). Bone age to chronological age ratio decreased from 1. 417 (n = 20) at baseline to 1. 18 (n = 8) at 48 months in treatment-naive children (P <. 01). Predicted adult height in girls increased from 151. 9 cm at baseline to 166. 5 cm at month 60 (n = 6; P <. 05), with a 10. 7 -cm height gain observed among treatment-naive children (n = 5). No adverse effect on growth or recovery of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis was observed with hormonal suppression. The <b>histrelin</b> implant was generally well tolerated during long-term therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Long-term <b>histrelin</b> implant therapy provided sustained gonadotropin suppression safely and effectively and improved predicted adult height in children with CPP...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe <b>histrelin</b> implant (Supprelin LA) is an efficacious, {{safe and}} well tolerated {{medication}} {{for the treatment}} of central precocious puberty (CPP). Minor reactions such as bruising, redness, and pain at the implant site have commonly occurred, but only two cases of systemic allergic reaction leading to emergent removal of device have previously been reported. An otherwise healthy eleven-year-old female with CPP and no history of prior supprelin implantation, and a nine-year-old female with CPP and history of two prior supprelin implantations without complications, had a supprelin implant inserted on the same day. Within days of the procedure both presented with severe allergic reaction and underwent removal of the device. A few months after removal, both children had another supprelin implant placed without complications. It was determined that the device was not the cause of the allergic reaction, but rather the dressing material included in the implantation kit that was the offending agent. This report describes two patients with a severe systemic allergic reaction after <b>histrelin</b> implant necessitating urgent implant removal with resolution of allergic symptoms. It was later determined that the allergic reaction was caused by a substance in the self-adhering dressing wrap...|$|E

40|$|Background. Gonadotropin {{releasing}} hormone analogs (GnRHas) are {{standard of care}} for central precocious puberty (CPP). The <b>histrelin</b> subcutaneous implant is safe and effective {{in the treatment of}} CPP for one year. Objective. The study evaluates a second year of therapy in children with CPP who received a new implant after one year of treatment. Methods. A prospective one-year study following an initial 12 -month treatment period was conducted. Results. Thirty-one patients (29 girls) aged 7. 7 &#x 00 B 1; 1. 5 years received a second implant. Eighteen were na&# 239;ve to GnRHa therapy at first implantation. Peak LH declined from 0. 92 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 58 &#x 2009;mIU/mL at 12 months to 0. 51 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 33 &#x 2009;mIU/mL at 24 months (P &# 60;. 0001) in na&# 239;ve subjects, and from 0. 74 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 50 &#x 2009;mIU/mL at 12 months to 0. 45 &#x 00 B 1; 0. 35 &#x 2009;mIU/mL at 24 months (P=. 0081) in previously treated subjects.

40|$|Testosterone {{suppression}} through orchidectomy is a gold-standard {{treatment for}} patients presenting with advanced prostate cancer. However, this {{can have a}} physical and psychological toll on patients, leaving many preferring androgen-deprivation therapy. To this end, luteinisinghormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonists are commonly used to achieve castrate levels of testosterone, with efficacy being {{comparable to that of}} orchidectomy. Although historically limited by short half-lives, scientific progress has led to increased potency of LHRH agonists through prolonged half-lives. Newer advances include the subcutaneous implantation device, which allows for constant release of <b>histrelin</b> acetate over 52 weeks, conferring advantages over previous therapies and necessitating repeat injections every one to six months. Suppression of testosterone levels to castrate levels {{has been shown to be}} comparable to orchidectomy at four weeks, and is safe and well-tolerated. Moreover, removal of the implant allows for rapid normalisation of testosterone levels. The conveniences associated with implantation compared with depot injections confer increased treatment flexibility to both patients and healthcare professionals. 4 page(s...|$|E

40|$|Background: Precocious puberty is a {{relatively}} rare disease with little documented information on etiology or long-term complications. Methods: Three cases of familial precocious puberty within a single family are reported. Two sisters inherited a gene malformation from their father who was untreated as a child. A literature review of 2 ̆ 2 precocious puberty 2 ̆ 2 was performed using journal articles on PubMed, Google Scholar, CDC website, UpToDate, and DynaMed. Results: Literature searches mentioned several possible contributors to early pubertal development. Onset of puberty occurs 2. 5 months earlier {{in the general population}} and earlier in African American decent, gene malformation, and childhood obesity. Some case reports link tea tree oil, lavender oil, bisphenol A, and pesticides to hormone disturbances. Treatment approaches may include observation, gonadotropin releasing hormone agonists, and growth factor. <b>Histrelin</b> implants have shown the greatest efficacy in delaying menarche by at least one year and increasing adult height by up to 7 cm from predicted height. In the reviewed cases, both sisters successfully received the implant to increase height and delay menstruation. These children may be at a higher risk for polycystic ovary syndrome and breast cancer.

To this end, we compared peak LH and FSH after 100 mg sc GnRH, estradiol, mean ovarian volume (MOV), age of onset and frequency of menses, body mass (BMI), and incidence of neuro-logical and psychiatric problems in 2 groups of girls: those with pre-cocious puberty due to hypothalamic hamartoma (HH; n 5 18) and those with idiopathic precocious puberty (IPP; n 5 32) who had been treated with deslorelin (4 – 8 mg/kgzday, sc) or <b>histrelin</b> (10 mg/kgzday, sc) for 3. 1 – 10. 3 yr and were observed at 1, 2, 3, and 4 – 5 yr after discontinuation of treatment. The endocrine findings were also com-pared to those in 14 normal perimenarcheal girls. There were no differences between the HH and IPP groups in age or bone age at the start of treatment, at the end of treatment, or during GnRH analog therapy. We found that whereas the peak LH level was higher in HH than in IPP girls before (165. 5 6 129 vs. 97. 5 6 55. 7; P, 0. 02) and at the end (6. 8 6 6. 0 vs. 3. 9 6 1. 8 mIU/mL; P, 0. 05) of therapy, this difference did not persist at any of the posttherapy time points. LH, FSH, and estradiol rose into the pubertal range by 1 yr posttherapy in both HH and IPP. However, the mean posttherapy peak LH levels in both HH and IPP groups tended to be lower than normal, whereas the peak FSH levels were not different from normal, so that the overall posttherapy LH/FSH ratio was decreased compared to that in the normal girls (HH, 2. 7 6 0. 3; IPP, 2. 6 6 0. 1; normal, 5. 2 6 4. 8; P, 0. 05). The MOV was larger in HH than IPP at the end of treatment (3. 7 6 3. 5 vs. 2. 0 6 1. 2 mL; P, 0. 05) and tended to increase in both groups over time to become larger than that in normal girls by 4 –...|$|E
