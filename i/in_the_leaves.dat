5|$|An {{analysis}} of the invertebrate population in the canopy of Banksia woodland found that mites and ticks (Acari), beetles (Coleoptera) and ants, bees and wasps (Hymenoptera) predominated overall, with the three orders also common on B. ilicifolia, although outnumbered by thrips (Thysanoptera). More arthropods on B. ilicifolia {{might be related to}} a higher nutrient (potassium) level <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves.</b> Lower overall numbers of invertebrates on Banksia species were thought {{to be related to the}} presence of insectivorous birds.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} Amarylidaceae genera, Narcissus {{contains}} unique isoquinoline alkaloids. The first alkaloid {{to be identified}} was lycorine, from N. pseudonarcissus in 1877. These are considered a protective adaptation, and are utilised in the classification of species. Nearly 100 alkaloids {{have been identified in}} the genus, about a third of all known Amaryllidaceae alkaloids, although not all species have been tested. Of the nine alkaloid ring types identified in the family, Narcissus species most commonly demonstrate the presence of alkaloids from within the Lycorine (lycorine, galanthine, pluviine) and Homolycorine (homolycorine, lycorenine) groups. Hemanthamine, Tazettine, Narciclasine, Montanine and Galantamine alkaloids are also represented. The alkaloid profile of any plant varies with time, location, and developmental stage. Narcissus also contain fructans and low molecular weight glucomannan <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> and plant stems.|$|E
5|$|Cooked {{tarantula}} spiders {{are considered}} a delicacy in Cambodia, and by the Piaroa Indians of southern Venezuela. Spider venoms may be a less polluting alternative to conventional pesticides as they are deadly to insects but the great majority are harmless to vertebrates. Possible medical uses for spider venoms are being investigated, {{for the treatment of}} cardiac arrhythmia, Alzheimer's disease, strokes, and erectile dysfunction. Because spider silk is both light and very strong, attempts are being made to produce it in goats' milk and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> of plants, by means of genetic engineering.|$|E

5|$|Cowpea is {{susceptible}} to nematode, fungal, bacterial and virus diseases, which can result in substantial loss in yield. Common diseases include blights, root rot, wilt, powdery mildew, root knot, rust and leaf spot. The plant is {{susceptible to}} mosaic viruses, which cause a green mosaic pattern to appear <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves.</b> The cowpea mosaic virus (CPMV), discovered in 1959, has become a useful research tool. CPMV is stable and easy to propagate to a high yield, making it useful in vector development and protein expression systems. One of the plant's defenses against some insect attacks is the cow pea trypsin inhibitor (CpTI). CpTI is the only gene obtained outside of B. thuringiensis that has been inserted into a commercially available genetically modified crop.|$|E
5|$|There {{are nine}} species of insect only found on C.australis, {{of which the}} best known is Epiphryne verriculata, the cabbage tree moth, which is {{perfectly}} adapted to hide on a dead leaf. Its caterpillars eat large holes and wedges <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves.</b> The moth lays its eggs {{at the base of}} the central spike of unopened leaves. The caterpillars eat holes in the surface of the leaves and leave characteristic notches in the leaf margins. They can infest young trees but seldom damage older trees, which lack the skirt of dead leaves where the parent moths like to hide.|$|E
5|$|Ailanthus {{produces}} an allelopathic chemical called ailanthone, which inhibits {{the growth of}} other plants. The inhibitors are strongest in the bark and roots, but are also present <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves,</b> wood and seeds of the plant. One study showed that a crude extract of the root bark inhibited 50% of a sample of garden cress (Lepidium sativum) seeds from germinating. The same study tested the extract as an herbicide on garden cress, redroot pigweed (Amaranthus retroflexus), velvetleaf (Abutilon theophrasti), yellow bristlegrass (Setaria pumila), barnyard grass (Echinochloa crusgalli), pea (Pisum sativum cv. Sugar Snap) and maize (Zea mays cv. Silver Queen). It proved able to kill nearly 100% of seedlings {{with the exception of}} velvetleaf, which showed some resistance. Another experiment showed a water extract of the chemical was either lethal or highly damaging to 11 North American hardwoods and 34 conifers, with the white ash (Fraxinus americana) being the only plant not adversely affected. The chemical does not, however, affect the tree of heaven's own seedlings, indicating that A. altissima has a defence mechanism to prevent autotoxicity. Resistance in various plant species has been shown to increase with exposure. Populations without prior exposure to the chemicals are most susceptible to them. Seeds produced from exposed plants have also been shown to be more resistant than their unexposed counterparts.|$|E

40|$|The {{activity}} of sucrose phosphate synthase, sucrose synthase, and acid invertase was monitored in 1 - to 2 -month-old sugar beet (Beta vulgaris L.) leaves. Sugar beet leaves achieve full laminar length in 13 days. Therefore, leaves were harvested at 2 -day intervals for 15 days. Sucrose phosphate synthase activity was not detectable for 6 days <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark-grown <b>leaves.</b> Once activity was measurable, sucrose phosphate synthase activity never exceeded half that observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light-grown <b>leaves.</b> After 8 days <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, <b>leaves</b> which were illuminated for 30 minutes {{showed no significant}} change in sucrose phosphate synthase activity. Leaves illuminated for 24 hours after 8 days in darkness, however, recovered sucrose phosphate synthase activity to 80 % of that of normally grown leaves. Sucrose synthase and acid invertase activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light-grown <b>leaves</b> both increased for the first 7 days and then decreased as <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> matured. <b>In</b> contrast, <b>the</b> {{activity of}} sucrose synthase oscillated throughout <b>the</b> growth period <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark-grown <b>leaves.</b> Acid invertase activity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark-grown <b>leaves</b> {{seemed to be the}} same as <b>the</b> activity found <b>in</b> <b>the</b> light-grown <b>leaves...</b>|$|R

25|$|The plant {{produces}} these pigments mainly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> {{and skin}} of the berries to protect the pulp and seeds from constant exposure to ultraviolet radiation and production of free radicals. By absorbing UV rays in the blue-purple spectrum, leaf and skin pigments filter intense sunlight, serve antioxidant functions and thereby have a role assuring regeneration of the species. Brightly colorful pigmentation also attracts birds and other animals to consume the fruit and disperse the seeds in their droppings.|$|E
25|$|Following the harvest, {{the vines}} {{continues}} {{the process of}} photosynthesis, creating carbohydrate reserves to store in the vine's roots and trunks. It will continue doing this until an appropriate level of reserves have been stored. At that point the chlorophyll <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>leaves</b> begin to break down and the leaves change color from green to yellow. Following the first frost the leaves begin to fall as the vine starts to enter its winter dormancy period. The following spring, the cycle begins again.|$|E

Therefore, pre- and postharvest bio-activity of <b>the</b> crown <b>leaves</b> of pineapple fruit were studied. With the fruit still attached to the plant, CAM activity was detected <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crown <b>leaves.</b> While post-transport diurnal light cycle conditions seemed to reactivate CAM <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crown <b>leaves,</b> no CAM activation was registered during cold-storage transport (simulated) under dark conditions. The substantial organic acid increase <b>in</b> <b>the</b> crown <b>leaves</b> during transport is thought to originate from the pineapple fruit itself and seems to be the major cause of leaf browning...|$|R
