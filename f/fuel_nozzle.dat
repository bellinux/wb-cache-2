2500|$|When fuel is vaporized, it cools the {{surrounding}} air due to the refrigeration effect as the fuel absorbs heat when it changes state from a liquid to a gas. This may result in the air dropping below freezing, causing water vapor contained {{in the air to}} first change state from a gas to a liquid, which then becomes ice. [...] This ice forms on the throttle plate, which is located [...] "down stream" [...] of the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle.</b> [...] The ice also forms on the inner walls of the carburetor, sometimes {{to such a degree that}} it blocks airflow to the engine.|$|E

The combustor is an impingement cooled annular design. [...] Fuel is delivered to the combustor through an unusual rotating <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> system, rather than the standard fuel-air mixers or vapourisers. The bypass duct runs the full length the engine. Specific fuel consumption at 1900lbf (8.45kN) thrust at SLS, ISA is understood to be 0.456lb/(hr lbf). A derated version, the 1500lbf (6.67kN) thrust FJ44-1C has an SFC of 0.460lb/(hr lbf).|$|E

2500|$|The German Grand Prix {{brought up}} more {{controversy}} leading to further allegations of cheating by Benetton. During a pit stop, the Benetton car of Jos Verstappen {{was set on}} fire during refuelling as the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> would not enter the car properly. Verstappen suffered minor burns, with four of the Benetton mechanics also burned. Intertechnique, the company which manufactures the refuelling equipment for all the teams, were delegated by the governing body to examine the Benetton factory shortly after the German race. After Intertechnique examined the factory, a statement was released by the FIA. In the statement, the FIA said that [...] "the [...] valve was slow to close {{because of the presence}} of a foreign body" [...] and that a filter designed to eliminate any possible risk of fire had been removed. An estimate by an outside party stated that without the filter, fuel flowed into the car at a 12.5% faster rate than usual, saving one second per pit stop. Benetton issued a press release shortly after, announcing that they had contacted an [...] "independent company specialising in accident investigation" [...] to give opinions on the refuelling method. They also announced that a copy of the FIA report had been sent to Marriott Harrison, their legal advisers. The FIA announced, as a result of their findings, that Benetton would be summoned to a World Motor Sport Council meeting on October 19. On August 11, three days before the Hungarian Grand Prix, Intertechnique representatives said that no request had been sent from Benetton to remove the filter from the nozzle and that they would never authorise Benetton to remove the nozzle. Benetton made a press release on August 13, stating that there was a fault in the equipment provided by Intertechnique.|$|E

40|$|A {{series of}} {{experiments}} {{was carried out in}} order to produce design data for a premixing prevaporizing fuel-air mixture preparation system for aircraft gas turbine engine combustors. The fuel-air mixture uniformity of four different system design concepts was evaluated over a range of conditions representing the cruise operation of a modern commercial turbofan engine. Operating conditions including pressure, temperature, fuel-to-air ratio, and velocity, exhibited no clear effect on mixture uniformity of systems using pressure-atomizing <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzles</b> and large-scale mixing devices.

50|$|If a {{jet plane}} is flying through air {{contaminated}} with volcanic ash, there is risk that ingested ash will cause erosion {{damage to the}} compressor blades, blockage of <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> air holes and blockage of the turbine cooling passages. Some of these effects may cause the engine to surge or flame-out during the flight. Re-lights are usually successful after flame-outs but with considerable loss of altitude. It {{was the case of}} British Airways Flight 9 which flew through volcanic dust at 37,000 ft. All 4 engines flamed out and re-light attempts were successful at about 13,000 ft.|$|E
50|$|To {{solve this}} problem, the Key brothers, along with local {{inventor}} and mechanic A. D. Hunter, invented a spill-free fueling system {{that consisted of}} a valve {{on the end of}} the <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzle</b> which was opened by a probe in the neck of the fuel tank. The valve would not allow fuel to flow unless it was inserted into the fuel tank. During fueling, if the nozzle was removed from the tank, the fuel would automatically stop flowing. This nozzle was later adopted by the US Army Air Corps, and is still in use today with some modifications.|$|E
50|$|A {{turboshaft}} engine {{may be made}} up of two major parts assemblies: the 'gas generator' and the 'power section'.

50|$|Plumes of {{volcanic}} ash near active volcanoes are an aviation safety hazard, especially for night flights. Volcanic ash is hard and abrasive, and can quickly cause significant wear to propellers and turbocompressor blades, and scratch cockpit windows, impairing visibility. The ash contaminates fuel and water systems, can jam gears, and make engines flameout. Its particles have low melting point, so they melt in the combustion chamber and the ceramic mass then sticks to turbine blades, <b>fuel</b> <b>nozzles,</b> and combustors—which {{can lead to}} total engine failure. Ash can also contaminate the cabin and damage avionics.|$|R
