500|$|Until 1977, <b>ethics</b> <b>rules</b> {{prevented}} {{accounting and}} auditing firms from advertising to clients. When {{the rules were}} lifted, spending by the largest CPA firms on advertisements rose from US$4 million in the 1980s to more than $100million in the 2000s. Critics claimed that, by allowing the firms to advertise, the business side overstepped the professional side of the profession, {{which led to a}} conflict of interest. This focus allowed for occurrences of fraud, and caused the firms, according to Arthur Bowman, [...] "... to offer services that made them more consultants and business advisers than auditors." [...] As accounting firms became less interested in the lower-paying audits due to more focus on higher earning services such as consulting, problems arose. This disregard for the lack of time spent on audits resulted in a lack of attention to catching creative and fraudulent accounting.|$|E

In March 2010, Rangel stepped aside as Ways and Means Chair.

2500|$|In July 2007, fellow Senator Tom Coburn criticized earmarks that Nelson had {{inserted}} into the 2007 defense spending bill. Coburn alleged that these earmarks would benefit Nelson's son Patrick's employer with millions in federal dollars, and that the situation violated terms of the Federal Funding Accountability and Transparency Act of 2006, which {{was passed by the}} Senate but has not yet been voted on in the House. Nelson's spokesperson said the Senator did nothing wrong and that he was only acting under [...] "an abundance of caution" [...] when he withdrew the amendment after the new Senate <b>Ethics</b> <b>Rules</b> were passed. Some government watchdogs, including Public Citizen, commented that the earmark probably didn't violate <b>ethics</b> <b>rules.</b> [...] Coburn's motives were called into question by more than one publication, as his criticism did not include his own state delegation's earmark requests.|$|E
2500|$|Because of {{concerns}} raised by David P. Weber, former SEC Chief Investigator, regarding conduct by SEC Inspector General H. David Kotz, Inspector General David C.

Williams concluded in his 66-page Report that Kotz violated <b>ethics</b> <b>rules</b> by overseeing probes that involved people with whom he had conflicts of interest due to [...] "personal relationships." [...] The report questioned Kotz's work on the Madoff investigation, among others, because Kotz was a [...] "very good friend" [...] with Markopolos. It concluded that while it was unclear when Kotz and Markopolos became friends, it would have violated U.S. <b>ethics</b> <b>rules</b> if their relationship began before or during Kotz's Madoff investigation. [...] The report also found that Kotz himself [...] "appeared to have a conflict of interest" [...] and should not have opened his Standford investigation, because he was friends with a female attorney who represented victims of the fraud.|$|E
