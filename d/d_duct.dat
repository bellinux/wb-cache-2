40|$|The {{simplest}} mixing problem {{corresponds to}} the mixing of a fluid with itself; this case provides a foundation on which the subject rests. The objective here is to study mixing independently of the mechanisms used to create the motion and review ele-ments of theory focusing mostly on mathematical foundations and minimal models. The flows under consideration will be of two types: two-dimensional (2 D) ‘blinking flows’, or three-dimensional (3 <b>D)</b> <b>duct</b> flows. Given that mixing in continuous 3 <b>D</b> <b>duct</b> flows depends critically on cross-sectional mixing, and that many microfluidic applications involve continuous flows, {{we focus on the}} essential aspects of mixing in 2 D flows, as they provide a foundation from which to base our understanding of more complex cases. The baker’s transformation is taken as the centrepiece for describing the dynamical systems framework. In particular, a hierarchy of characterizations of mixing exist, Bernoulli → mixing → ergodic, ordered according to the quality of mixing (the strongest first). Most importantly for the design process, we show how the so-called linked twist maps function as a minimal picture of mixing, provide a mathematical structure for understanding the type of 2 D flows that arise in many micromixers already built, and give conditions guaranteeing the best quality mixing. Extensions of these concepts lead to first-principle-based designs without resorting to lengthy computations...|$|E

40|$|The {{theoretical}} {{study of}} the resonances of an elastic plate in a compressible flow in a 2 <b>D</b> <b>duct</b> is presented. Due to the fluid-structure coupling a quadratic eigenvalue problem is involved, in which the resonance frequencies k solve the equations λ(k) = k 2 where γ are the eigenvalues of a self-adjoint operator of the form A + kB. In a previous paper we have already proved that a linear eigenvalue problem can be recovered if the plate is rigid or the fluid at rest. We focus here on the general problem for which elasticity and flow are jointly present and derive a lower bound {{for the number of}} resonances. The expression of this bound, based on the solution of two linear eigenvalues problems, points out that the coupling between elasticity and flow generally reduces the number of resonances. This estimate is validated numerically...|$|E
40|$|A {{continuous}} adjoint formulation for inverse design {{problems in}} external aerodynamics and turbomachinery is presented. The {{advantage of the}} proposed formulation is that the objective function gradient does not depend upon the variation of field geometrical quantities, such as metrics variations {{in the case of}} structured grids. The final expression for the objective function gradient includes only boundary integrals which can readily be calculated in both structured and unstructured grids; this is feasible in design problems where the objective function is either a boundary integral (pressure deviation along the solid walls) or a field integral (the entropy generation over the flow domain). The formulation governs inviscid and viscous flows; it takes into account the streamtube thickness variation terms in quasi- 3 D cascade designs or rotational terms in rotating blade design problems. The application of the method is illustrated through a number of design problems concerning isolated airfoils, a 3 <b>D</b> <b>duct,</b> 2 D, quasi- 3 D and 3 D, stationary and rotating turbomachinery blades.

40|$|For the {{relatively}} high frequencies relevant in a turbofan engine duct the modes of a lined sec-tion may be classified in two categories: genuine acoustic 3 <b>D</b> <b>duct</b> modes resulting from the finiteness of the duct geometry, and 2 D surface waves that exist only near the wall surface in a way essentially independent {{of the rest of}} the duct. Per frequency and circumferential order there are at most 4 surface waves. They occur in two kinds: 2 acoustic surface waves that exist with and without mean flow, and 2 hydrodynamic surface waves that exist only with mean flow. The number and location of the surface waves depends on the wall impedance Z and mean flow Mach number. When Z is varied, an acoustic mode may change via small transition zones into a surface waves and vice versa. Compared to the acoustic modes, the surface waves behave – for example as a function of the wall impedance – rather differently as they have their own dynamics. They are therefore more difficult to find. A method is described to trace all modes by continuation in Z from the hard-wall values, by starting in an area of the complex Z plane without surface waves. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{design of}} systems {{involving}} fluid flows is typically based on computationally intensive Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations. Kriging based optimization methods, especially the Efficient Global Optimization (EGO) algorithm, are now {{often used to}} solve deterministic optimization problems involving such expensive models. When the design accounts for uncertainties, the optimization is usually based on double loop approaches where the uncertainty propagation (e. g., Monte Carlo simulations, reliability index calculation) is recursively performed inside the optimization iterations. We have proposed in a previous work a single loop kriging based method for minimizing the mean of an objective function: simulations points are calculated in order to simultaneously propagate uncertainties, i. e., estimate the mean objective function, and optimize this mean. In this report this method {{has been applied to}} the shape optimization of a 2 D air conditioning duct. For comparison purposes, deterministic designs were first obtained by the EGO algorithm. Very high performance designs were obtained, but they are also very sensitive to numerical model parameters such as mesh size, which suggests a bad consistency between the physics and the numerical model. The 2 <b>D</b> <b>duct</b> test case has then been reformulated by introducing shape uncertainties. The mean of the duct performance criteria with respect to shape uncertainties has been maximized with the simultaneous optimization and sampling method. The solutions found were not only robust to shape uncertainties but also to the CFD model numerical parameters. These designs show that the method is of practical interest in engineering tasks...|$|E
40|$|An {{asymptotic}} {{analysis for}} magnetohydrodynamic flows between perfectly conducting concentric cylindrical shells has been performed. The {{flow in the}} model geometry exhibits all features which had been discovered {{in the past for}} the case of differentially rotating spherical shells considered in the context of geophysical analyses. For strong magnetic fields the flow region splits into distinct subregions and exhibits two different types of cores which are separated from each other by a tangent shear layer. The fluid in one core flows similar to a solid-body rotation and the outer core is entirely stagnant. For stronger magnetic fields the shear layer becomes thinner and since the flow rate carried by the layer asymptotes to a finite value the velocity in the layer increases as the layer thickness decreases. Moreover, the flux carried by the layer rotates in the opposite direction compared with the rotation of the body. It is shown that the rotating jet is driven by the electric potential difference between the edges of the inner and the outer core. The considered tangent layer is very similar to the internal layers observed in pressure driven 3 D MHD flows through ducts with sharp expansions. Such flows received attention in nuclear fusion engineering as e. g. described in Buehler (2003), technical report, Forschungszentrum Karlsruhe, FZKA 6904. While in the case of 3 <b>D</b> <b>duct</b> flows the core solutions have to be determined numerically, in the present example of a rotating flow, the core solutions are known analytically. For that reason the rotating layer served as a test example for the derivation of the more complex flows described in the latter reference. (orig.)

D. device can cause large eddy currents to circulate within the M. H. <b>D.</b> <b>duct.</b> We have used apparatus in which we represent the moving stream of liquid by an annular disc of aluminium, to investigate the perturbation of the applied magnetic field and of the electric potential distribution caused by these eddy currents. We then examine both experimentally and theoretically, devices in which large currents flow through a moving conductor and through an external circuit. These currents are injected into the moving conductor through electrodes which have a high resistance to currents in the direction of motion. We show that for compensated devices, that is, devices in which the external conductors are arranged so that they produce no transverse magnetic field, the perturbed magnetic field does not depend upon the current through the external circuit and is the same field that would exist if there were no contact between the moving metal and the external circuit. We observe experimentally that when two conductors move side by side through the gap of a magnet the magnetic field in one moving conductor is little affected by the motion of the other. We compare the measured performance of a simulated M. H. D. generator and of a real M. H. D. pump with their computed performances and we calculate the expected performance of a flow coupler. We suggest that the presence of a slowly moving liquid in the boundary layers adjacent to the duct walls may adversely affect {{the performance of a}} flow coupler and we conclude that an efficient flow coupler would require non-conducting duct walls and a high magnetic field...|$|E
40|$|Wood {{waste is}} the most popular biomass {{recourse}} for many nations. Burned wood can, direct or indirect, release one of the greenhouse gases, carbon dioxide. The process can still be seen as a renewable source of energy since replanting of the trees and crops are consuming nearly the same amount of carbon dioxide through photosynthesis. Thermal gasification is one of the efficient methods to utilize energy from wood waste. Products from the component of concern can be used for direct energy production like in boilers and gas turbines or indirectly via dimethyl ether (DME), for instance. The physics of gasification is complex and several issues can influence the process. There is a lack of knowledge of several phenomena, some of which are related to solid-gas flow in the gasifier and in the premixed feeding pipelines. One such area is mechanisms related to turbulence modulation in the presence of spherical and non-spherical particles and how much the flow can disturb the motion of the particles. This is studied in the present thesis and the motion of the particles in different flow field is disclosed. At the moment there is no agreement in the scientific community on a single dimensionless number that can safely describe the influence of spherical particles in turbulent flow. For non-spherical particles additional levels of freedom are introduced and the dependence on drag and lift from the orientation of the particles as a function of Reynolds number adds to the complexity. Based on a literature review a fundamental experimental study is carried out in simple flow field geometry, a 2 <b>D</b> <b>duct</b> flow. The aim is to reveal the influence of spherical glass particle on the turbulent flow field in the core and near wall flows. Additional studies with wood particles gave more information about how real biomass particles affect the turbulence as compared to spherical ones. Next the instantaneous distribution of biomass particles was studied experimentally. It is known that this distribution significantly influences the soot formation in a gasifier. Two different techniques of flow control were studied, swirling flow and synthetic jet flow. Particles shape and inertia and the strength of vortices and vortices interaction in coaxial jets and swirling jet flow were studied and yielded a high influence on the preferential concentration of particles {{as well as on the}} root mean square values for velocity in coaxial jets flow. The synthetic jet add momentum to the flow without disturbing the mass loading ratio and result in higher dispersion of the particles away from the centreline of the jet.
