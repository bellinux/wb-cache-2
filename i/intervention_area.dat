5000|$|In 2006, Orion created Ossário, an {{intervention}} {{in one of}} São Paulo's road tunnels, spending 13 nights or early mornings using pieces of cloth to {{remove some of the}} thick layer of soot from vehicle exhausts impregnating sidewalls. But the grime was selectively wiped off {{in such a way that}} skulls were outlined by the grime left on the walls. The tunnel became a catacomb with over 3,500 hand-designed skulls reminding people that the same black soot impregnating tunnel walls also darkens our lungs and our lives. Our very own archeological site was brought to our notice. [...] The work was done at night as Orion faced deafening traffic noise, the suffocating sensation of stagnant air, and numerous police checks. But cleaning is not a crime; polluting is. As the work progressed, it became clear that nobody could stop him cleaning up - except by doing the job before him. So a few weeks later, teams of municipal workers turned up to remove grime, but only from the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> The rest of the tunnel was left as it was. As if nothing had happened, Orion continued working until the municipal staff returned. This time, they washed the whole tunnel. The name of the crime had changed: now it was censorship. After the intervention, all the road tunnels in the city were cleaned up. But the recently washed walls became black again in an amazing short time. The Ossário message had already been delivered. But Orion did not stop there. Returning to the tunnels, he drew the skulls and took the dust or soot off the walls using rags. Then, he washed the rags and waited for the soot to settle and the water to evaporate until just the black powder from exhaust tubes was left. This apparently useless toxic substance was made into pigment and used for the works in the Art Less Pollution series of large-scale paintings, their impressive realism evoking old advertising images with a touch of irony. Orion is using pollution to portray the apparently inoffensive everyday existence that produces it.|$|E

40|$|Objective: The {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the effect of health and nutrition training among health workers on anaemia in rural communities of Tanzania. Methods: The study utilised two sets of data. Data on haemoglobin levels (secondary data) for under five children and pregnant women attending maternal and child health clinics at the sentinel district hospital was obtained from Tanzania Food and Nutrition Centre (TFNC). Data was collected in the months of May and November from November 1997 to November 1998. At the sentinel laboratory a cyanomethaemoglobin method was used to determine haemoglobin concentration. Haemoglobin levels of less than 11 gm/dl was used to define anaemia for the two population groups. Primary data on knowledge, attitudes and practices among health workers and community members on anaemia were obtained through a cross-sectional study in the intervention and control areas in October 2000. The study areas were among the sentinel districts for anaemia surveillance. The <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> was randomly selected among those districts where health and nutrition training was provided to the health workers. The control area was selected from the areas where no health and nutrition training was instituted to the health workers. Control area had similar socioeconomic and geographical characteristics with the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> Results: Anaemia was highly prevalent in the two study population in both areas, the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> having significantly higher prevalence (82 %) than the control area (76 %) in under five children (p = 0. 028). A similar trend was observed in pregnant women, 75 percent being anaemic in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> as opposed to 72 percent in the control area but {{the difference between the two}} areas was not significant. For both groups prevalence of anaemia was observed to be high in May than in November (p < 0. 001). Regarding knowledge, health workers and respondents at household level in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> had higher knowledge than in the control area. However, the percentage of respondents with good knowledge was very low. Although there was some improved practices in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area,</b> it did not reflect the knowledge improvement as compared to the control area. Dietary practices favorable to prevent anaemia were found to be more in the control area than in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> Staples were the food group regularly consumed by the majority in both areas at household level than any other food groups. Conclusion: Findings of this study indicate that the observed high prevalence of anaemia in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> may partly be explained by lack of good knowledge on anaemia among the majority of health workers. Further, this may have lead to poor practices for the prevention and control of anaemia at community level. Therefore, there is a need for reviewing the health and nutrition training programme so that its future implementation can bring desirable change through improved knowledge among the health workers, involvement of policy makers and active cooperation of the community members.

By relating the transformations of this policy to the contemporary restructuring of the French state, the paper argues that although there are elements of convergence, the contemporary restructuring of the French state differs remarkably from a US or UK-style neoliberalization, partly because of the republican tradition emphasizing the active role of the state for the well-being of its citizens. This restructuring carries the signs of the strong state tradition in France, and is best understood as an articulation of neoliberalism with established political traditions, an articulation that I try to capture with the notion of a ''republican penal state''...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the current study}} was to evaluate outcomes of a program to prevent traffic injuries among the different social strata under WHO Safe Community Program. A quasi-experimental design was used, with pre- and post-implementation registrations in the program implementation area (population 41, 000) and in a neighbouring control municipality (population 26, 000) in Östergötland County, Sweden. The traffic injury rate in the not vocationally active households was twice than employed or self-employed households in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> In the employed and not vocationally active households, males showed higher injury rates than females in both areas. In the self-employed households females exhibited higher injury rates than males in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> Males from not vocationally active households displayed the highest post-intervention injury rate in both the intervention and control areas. After 6 years of Safe Community program activity, the injury rates for males in employed category, injury rates for females in self-employed category, and males/females in non- vocationally active category displayed a decreasing trend in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> However, in the control area injury rate decreased only for males of employed households. The study indicated that there was almost no change in injury rates in the control area.

40|$|Background: Schistosoma mansoni {{infection}} is a persistent {{public health problem}} in many Kenyan communities. Although praziquantel is available, re-infection after chemotherapy treatment is inevitable, especially among children. Chemotherapy followed by intermittent mollusciciding of habitats of Biomphalaria pfeifferi, the intermediate host snail, may have longer term benefits, especially if timed to coincide with natural fluctuations in snail populations. Methods: In this cohort study, the Kambu River (<b>Intervention</b> <b>area)</b> was molluscicided intermittently for 4 years, after mass chemotherapy with praziquantel in the adjacent community of Darajani in January 1997. The nearby Thange River was selected as a control (Non-intervention area), and its adjacent community of Ulilinzi was treated with praziquantel in December 1996. Snail numbers were recorded monthly at 9 – 10 sites along each river, while rainfall data were collected monthly, and annual parasitological surveys were undertaken in each village. The mollusciciding protocol was adapted to local conditions, and simplified to improve prospects for widespread application. Results: After the initial reduction in prevalence attributable to chemotherapy, there was a gradual increase in the prevalence and intensity of infection in the non-intervention area, and significantly lower levels of re-infection amongst inhabitants of the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> Incidence ratio between areas adjusted for age and gender at the first follow-up survey, 5 weeks after treatment in the non-intervention area and 4 months after treatment in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> was not significant (few people turned positive), while during the following 4 annual surveys these ratios were 0. 58 (0. 39 - 0. 85), 0. 33 (0. 18 - 0. 60), 0. 14 (0. 09 - 0. 21) and 0. 45 (0. 26 - 0. 75), respectively. Snail numbers were consistently low in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> {{as a result of}} the mollusciciding. Following termination of the mollusciciding at the end of 2000, snail populations and infections in snails increased again in the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> Conclusion: The results of this study demonstrate that in the Kenyan setting a combination of chemotherapy followed by intermittent mollusciciding can have longer term benefits than chemotherapy alone...|$|E

Lifestyle <b>interventions</b> targeted the urban and rural populations in the intervention counties but were not implemented in Arak. In each community, a random sample of adults was selected yearly by multi-stage cluster sampling.

40|$|Restoration {{interventions}} to combat land degradation {{are carried out}} in arid and semi-arid areas to improve vegetation cover and land productivity. Evaluating the success of an intervention over time is challenging due to various constraints (e. g. difficult-to-access areas, lack of long-term records) {{and the lack of}} standardised and affordable methodologies. We propose a semi-automatic methodology that uses remote sensing data to provide a rapid, standardised and objective assessment of the biophysical impact, in terms of vegetation cover, of restoration interventions. The Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) is used as a proxy for vegetation cover. Recognising that changes in vegetation cover are naturally due to environmental factors such as seasonality and inter-annual climate variability, conclusions about the success of the intervention cannot be drawn by focussing on the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> only. We therefore use a comparative method that analyses the temporal variations (before and after the intervention) of the NDVI of the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> with respect to multiple control sites that are automatically and randomly selected from a set of candidates that are similar to the <b>intervention</b> <b>area.</b> Similarity is defined in terms of class composition as derived from an ISODATA classification of the imagery before the intervention. The method provides an estimate of the magnitude and significance of the difference in greenness change between the <b>intervention</b> <b>area</b> and control areas. As a case study, the methodology is applied to 15 restoration interventions carried out in Senegal. The impact of the interventions is analysed using 250 -m MODIS and 30 -m Landsat data. Results show that a significant improvement in vegetation cover was detectable only in one third of the analysed interventions, which is consistent with independent qualitative assessments based on field observations and visual analysis of high resolution imagery. Rural development agencies may potentially use the proposed method for a first screening of restoration interventions. European Unio...|$|E

Mothers were trained to recognize the symptoms of pneumonia and 60 percent reported pneumonia cases to get medical assistance. In addition, the availability of clean water and sanitation was located within <b>intervention</b> <b>areas,</b> but only reached 10 percent of households.|$|R

In 2001, the Welsh Government, United Kingdom, funded Communities First, a program of neighborhood regeneration delivered to the 100 most deprived of the 881 electoral wards in Wales. In this study, the authors examined the association between neighborhood regeneration and mental health. Information on regeneration activities in 35 <b>intervention</b> <b>areas</b> (n= 4, 197 subjects) and 75 control areas (n= 6, 695 subjects) were linked to data on mental health from a cohort study with assessments in 2001 (before regeneration) and 2008 (after regeneration). Propensity score matching was used to estimate the change in mental health in intervention versus control neighborhoods. Baseline differences between <b>intervention</b> and control <b>areas</b> were of a similar magnitude as produced by paired randomization of neighborhoods. Regeneration was associated with an improvement in the mental health of residents in <b>intervention</b> <b>areas</b> compared to control neighborhoods (β coefficient = 1. 54, 95 % confidence interval: 0. 50, 2. 59), suggesting a reduction in socioeconomic inequalities in mental health. There was a dose response relationship between length of residence in regeneration neighborhoods and improvements in mental health (P-for-trend = 0. 05). These results show the targeted regeneration of deprived neighborhoods can improve mental health...|$|R
