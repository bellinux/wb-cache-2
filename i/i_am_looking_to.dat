6000|$|Forgive this cold-blooded machinery--for I {{have been}} of late a {{stricken}} man, and still am not on my legs; though judging it a bit urgent to briefly communicate with you on a small practical matter. I have had quite a Devil of a summer, a very bad and damnable July and August, through a renewal of an ailment that I had regarded as a good deal subdued, but that descended upon me in force just after I last saw you and then absolutely raged for many weeks. (I allude to a most deplorable tendency to chronic pectoral, or, more specifically, anginal, pain; which, however, I finally, about a month ago, got {{more or less the}} better of, in a considerably reassuring way.) I was but beginning to profit by this comparative reprieve when I was smitten with a violent attack of the atrocious affection known as [...] "Shingles"--my impression of the nature of which had been vague and inconsiderate, but to the now grim shade of which I take off my hat in the very abjection of respect. It has been a very horrible visitation, but I am getting better; only I am still in bed and have to appeal to you in this graceless mechanical way. My appeal bears on a tiny and trivial circumstance, the fact that I have practically concluded an agreement for a Flat which I saw and liked and seemed to find within my powers before leaving town (No. 21 Carlyle Mansions, Cheyne Walk, S.W.) and which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> for a more convenient and secure basis of regularly wintering in London, for the possibly brief remainder of my days, than any I have for a long time had. I want, in response to a letter just received from the proprietors of the same, to floor that apparently rather benighted and stupid body, who are restless over the question of a [...] "social reference" [...] (in addition to my reference to my Bankers), by a regular knock-down production of the most eminent and exalted tie I can produce; whereby I have given them your distinguished name as that of a voucher for my respectability--as distinguished from my solvency; for which latter I don't hint that you shall, however dimly, engage! So I have it on my conscience, you see, to let you know of the liberty I have thus taken with you; this on the chance of their really applying to you (which some final saving sense of their being rather silly may indeed keep them from doing.) If they do, kindly, very kindly, abound in my sense to the extent of intimating to them that not to know me famed for my respectability is scarcely to be respectable themselves! That is all I am able to trouble you with now. I am as yet a poor thing, more even the doctor's than mine own; but shall come round presently and shall then be able to give you a better account of myself. There is no question of my getting into the Flat in question till some time in January; I don't get possession till Dec. 25th, but this preliminary has had to be settled. Don't be burdened to write; I know your cares are on the eve of beginning again, and how heavy they may presently be. I have only wanted to create for our ironic intelligence the harmless pleasure of letting loose a little, in a roundabout way, upon the platitude of the City and West End Properties Limited, the dread effulgence of their Lordships; the latter being the light and you the transparent lantern that my shaky hand holds up. More, as I say, when that hand is less shaky. I hope all your intimate news is good, and am only waiting for the new vol. of the Dictionary with your Swinburne, which a word from Sidney Lee has assured me is of maximum value. All faithful greeting.|$|E

5000|$|After “One,” and {{expressed}} most with “The Rising of the son,” Patrice coined a new genre for his music, termed “Sweggae.” He states, “I {{tried to find}} a common ground between all these things I love. Blues, Hip Hop, Dancehall, singer-songwriter music, Afro-Beat, Rock, philosophy, poetry, and the list is long. I didn't want it to sound like a mix but a style that in a very self explicatory way reflects these times that we're living in. Times in which it's getting hard to tell black from white. Times where cultures and genres are mixed to the point that you can't tell what's what anymore. I am a living symbol of these times. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> create its soundtrack.” French newspaper, Le Monde, started using the genre [...] "sweggae" [...] and both they and Patrice describe it as music with reggae undertones with a more modernist take, reflective of someone who created his own culture out of many things.|$|E

40|$|Years ago, the Saltine Warrior was the mascot for Syracuse University; however, it {{was decided}} that the Warrior {{offended}} Native American students and inappropriately depicted Native American Students. For many, the Native American population at Syracuse University is non-apparent, and Native American students seem to have been displaced from higher education. The Haudenosaunee Promise is an attempt by SU to make a collegiate education more accessible for students from on of the Six Nations. However, the Native American students still seem invisible to most students. My interest is how the Native American population views the Haudenosaunee Promise as an entry to college, and how they maintain their relationships with other Haudenosaunee students. While they live within the boundaries of United States, these students come from their own sovereign nations. In my study of students' experiences, for those who have come through the program, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> see if they share more in common with international students then with other American students...|$|E

40|$|John Rocque?s four-sheet Exact {{survey of}} the city and suburbs of Dublin, 1756, was the most {{comprehensive}} and detailed mapping of any city in these islands before the establishment of the Ordnance Survey in the early- 19 th century. Rocque was responsible for city maps throughout Europe including ones of Rome, Paris and London. However despite their considerable detail and large scale ? the London map comprised 24 sheets and measured 7 ft by 13 ft ? they were all limited to the depiction of the city block. The Dublin map, by contrast, was the only one to provide a detailed plan of every single house plot, out-building, avenue, laneway, courtyard and garden, within the precincts of the mid- 18 th-century city.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to raise {{awareness}} about the experiences multiracial students face on college campuses specifically working to understand how multiracial students experience and manage microaggressions on campus in their daily lives. Within this I will take into account their experiences on campus as a framework for the types of microaggressions they are facing because this act of racism can be known or unknown to the victim. A microaggression is a form of racism that is “brief and commonplace daily verbal, behavioral, or environmental indignities, whether intentional or unintentional, that communicate[s] hostile, derogatory, or negative racial slights and insults to the target person or group” (Sue, Capodilupo, Torino, Bucceri, Holder, Nadal 2 ̆ 6 Esquilin, 2007, p. 273). In my research <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>looking</b> <b>to</b> answer the following research questions: (a) what are the experiences of multiracial students on a predominantly White campus, specifically with regards to microaggressions? (b) How do multiracial students manage these microaggressions?
