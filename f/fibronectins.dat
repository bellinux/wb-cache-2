50|$|<b>Fibronectins</b> are glycoproteins {{that connect}} cells with {{collagen}} fibers in the ECM, allowing cells {{to move through}} the ECM. <b>Fibronectins</b> bind collagen and cell-surface integrins, causing a reorganization of the cell's cytoskeleton to facilitate cell movement. <b>Fibronectins</b> are secreted by cells in an unfolded, inactive form. Binding to integrins unfolds fibronectin molecules, allowing them to form dimers so that they can function properly. <b>Fibronectins</b> also help at the site of tissue injury by binding to platelets during blood clotting and facilitating cell movement to the affected area during wound healing.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fibronectins</b> bind to ECM macromolecules and {{facilitate}} their binding to transmembrane integrins.

40|$|Under some conditions, {{mononuclear}} phagocytes spontaneously synthesize {{and release}} <b>fibronectin,</b> an extracellular matrix glycoprotein with versatile effects on cell-matrix interactions.

Using Northern analysis and dot-blot analysis with a 32 P-labeled human <b>fibronectin</b> cDNA probe, we evaluated steady-state mRNA levels and a human fibronectin-specific ELISA was used to evaluate <b>fibronectin</b> secretion. In all cases the amounts of <b>fibronectin</b> secreted paralleled <b>fibronectin</b> mRNA levels. Specifically (a) when <b>fibronectin</b> mRNA was undetectable, {{as in the case of}} normal blood monocytes, no <b>fibronectin</b> was secreted, but whenever <b>fibronectin</b> mRNA was present, as in normal alveolar macrophages, <b>fibronectin</b> was secreted by the cells; (b) as monocytes matured into macrophages in vitro, the cells began to express <b>fibronectin</b> mRNA and the cells secreted fibronectin; (c) when alveolar macrophages were activated with surface stimuli such as lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or immune complexes, <b>fibronectin</b> mRNA levels decreased and in parallel, the cells secreted less fibronectin; (d) in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), alveolar macrophages contained severalfold more <b>fibronectin</b> mRNA transcripts that normal and the cells spontaneously secreted severalfold more <b>fibronectin</b> than normal; and (e) when IPF alveolar macrophages were placed in culture the <b>fibronectin</b> mRNA levels in the cells decreased with time, and concurrently the amounts of <b>fibronectin</b> produced per unit time continually decreased. The observation of a strict concordance of <b>fibronectin</b> mRNA levels and <b>fibronectin</b> release by mononuclear phagocytes suggests that, at least in many circumstances, <b>fibronectin</b> secretion by mononuclear phagocytes is controlled by steady-state levels of <b>fibronectin</b> mRNA...|$|R

40|$|To {{learn how}} plasma <b>fibronectin</b> stabilizes platelet-rich thrombi in injured {{mesenteric}} arterioles of mice, we studied {{the impact of}} plasma <b>fibronectin</b> on platelet thrombus formation ex vivo in a parallel flow chamber. Thrombi were greater on surfaces coated with fibrin cross-linked to <b>fibronectin</b> by activated factor XIII than on surfaces coated with fibrin lacking cross-linked <b>fibronectin</b> or with <b>fibronectin</b> alone. Platelet thrombi were even greater when plasma <b>fibronectin</b> was perfused with platelets, resulting in deposition of the perfused <b>fibronectin</b> in platelet thrombi. The effect of perfused <b>fibronectin</b> on thrombogenesis was lost if <b>fibronectin</b> deposition was blocked by coperfusion with the N-terminal 70 -kDa fragment of <b>fibronectin</b> or a peptide based on the functional upstream domain of protein F 1 of Streptococcus pyogenes.

40|$|The {{extracellular}} matrix (ECM) is dynamically remodeled by cells during development, normal tissue homeostasis {{and in a}} variety of disease processes. We previously showed that <b>fibronectin</b> is an important regulator of ECM remodeling. The deposition and/or polymerization of <b>fibronectin</b> into the ECM controls the deposition and stability of other ECM molecules. In addition, agents that inhibit <b>fibronectin</b> polymerization promote the turnover of <b>fibronectin</b> fibrils and enhance ECM <b>fibronectin</b> endocytosis and intracellular degradation. Endocytosis of ECM <b>fibronectin</b> is regulated by b 1 integrins, including a 5 b 1 integrin. We have examined the role of extracellular proteases in regulating ECM <b>fibronectin</b> turnover. Our data show that membrane type matrix metalloproteinase 1 (MT 1 -MMP; also known as MMP 14) is a crucial regulator of <b>fibronectin</b> turnover. Cells lacking MT 1 -MMP show reduced turnover and endocytosis of ECM <b>fibronectin.</b> MT 1 -MMP regulates ECM <b>fibronectin</b> remodeling by promoting extracellular cleavage of <b>fibronectin</b> and by regulating a 5 b 1 -integrin endocytosis. Our data also show that <b>fibronectin</b> polymerization stabilizes <b>fibronectin</b> fibrils and inhibits ECM <b>fibronectin</b> endocytosis by inhibiting a 5 b 1 -integrin endocytosis. These data are the first to show that an ECM protein and its modifying enzyme can regulate integrin endocytosis. These data also show that integrin trafficking {{plays a major role in}} modulating ECM <b>fibronectin</b> remodeling. The dual dependence of ECM <b>fibronectin</b> turnover on extracellular proteolysis and endocytosis highlights the complex regulatory mechanisms that control ECM remodeling to ensure maintenance of proper tissue function...|$|R

Soluble <b>fibronectin</b> bound to S. pyogenes in a dose-dependent and irreversible manner. Lipoteichoic acid competitively inhibited the binding of <b>fibronectin</b> to S. pyogenes but {{had little effect}} on the binding of <b>fibronectin</b> to staphylococci or pneumococci. The phase of growth of the streptococci had a slight effect on binding of <b>fibronectin,</b> with optimal binding occurring in the late log phase. S. pyogenes cells bound to <b>fibronectin</b> immobilized on microtiter plates in a dose-dependent and saturable manner.

50|$|Plasma fibronectin, {{which is}} {{synthesized}} by hepatocytes, and fibronectin synthesized by cultured fibroblasts are similar but not identical; immunological, structural, and functional differences have been reported. It {{is likely that}} these differences result from differential processing of a single nascent mRNA. Nevertheless, plasma fibronectin can be insolubilized into the tissue extracellular matrix in vitro and in vivo. Both plasma and cellular <b>fibronectins</b> in the matrix form high molecular weight, disulfide-bonded multimers. The mechanism of formation of these multimers is not presently known. Plasma fibronectin {{has been shown to}} contain two free sulfhydryls per subunit (X), and cellular fibronectin has been shown to contain at least one. These sulfhydryls probably are buried within the tertiary structure, because sulfhydryls are exposed when the fibronectin is denatured. Such denaturation results in the oxidation of free sulfhydryls and formation of disulfide-bonded fibronectin multimers. This has led to speculation that the free sulfhydryls may be involved in formation of disulfide-bonded fibronectin multimers in the extracellular matrix. Consistent with this, sulfhydryl modification of fibronectin with N-ethylmaleimide prevents binding to cell layers. Tryptic cleavage patterns of multimeric fibronectin do not reveal the disulfide-bonded fragments that would be expected if multimerization involved {{one or both of the}} free sulfhydryls. The free sulfhydryls of fibronectin are not required for the binding of fibronectin to the cell layer or for its subsequent incorporation into the extracellular matrix. Disulfide-bonded multimerization of fibronectin in the cell layer occurs by disulfide bond exchange in the disulfide-rich amino-terminal one-third of the molecule.|$|E

Comparison of <b>fibronectin</b> levels in fibroblasts derived from keloids and normal dermis revealed a relative increase in intracellular and extracellular <b>fibronectin</b> in the keloid-derived cells. While <b>fibronectin</b> was similarly processed, compartmentalized, and degraded by both cell types, <b>fibronectin</b> biosynthesis was found to be accelerated as much as fourfold in keloid fibroblasts due to a corresponding increase in the amount of accumulated <b>fibronectin</b> mRNA. These changes account for the elevated steady-state level of the molecule in keloid fibroblasts and suggest that increased <b>fibronectin</b> in keloid lesions is due to overproduction by the wound-healing fibroblasts. Glucocorticoid treatment stimulated <b>fibronectin</b> biosynthesis in both normal and keloid fibroblasts.

40|$|AIM [...] To {{determine}} {{concentrations of}} <b>fibronectin</b> and <b>fibronectin</b> receptor {{in children with}} pertussis. METHODS [...] Concentrations of circulating <b>fibronectin</b> and serum <b>fibronectin</b> receptor were detected in eight children affected by pertussis, eight children with acute upper or lower respiratory tract infections, and in 14 healthy control children. The single radial immunodiffusion technique and a solid phase enzyme immunoassay were used to detect circulating serum concentrations of <b>fibronectin</b> and <b>fibronectin</b> receptor. RESULTS [...] On admission, {{a significant decrease in}} <b>fibronectin</b> was detected in children with pertussis (p = 0. 0006). Significant and decreased concentrations of <b>fibronectin</b> were also observed in children with upper or lower respiratory tract infections (p = 0. 0002). On the other hand, serum <b>fibronectin</b> receptor concentrations were significantly increased in patients with pertussis, whereas patients with upper or lower respiratory tract infections had normal circulating <b>fibronectin</b> receptor concentrations.

Early- and late-amniotic-fluid fibronectin had 9. 5 and 9. 6 % carbohydrate respectively, whereas plasma fibronectin had 5. 8 %. The amniotic-fluid <b>fibronectins</b> had similar mannose and sialic acid contents to plasma fibronectin, but greater amounts of glucosamine, galactosamine, galactose and fucose.

40|$|<b>Fibronectins</b> {{isolated}} fro early-passage and late-passage (in vitro aged) human fibroblasts {{were shown}} to differ {{in their ability to}} support cell adhesion and to influence cell morphology. Because fibroblast adhesion requires interactions between fibronectin, the cell surface, and the component of the extracellular matrix, we examined those functions in isolated cellular fibronectin. In comparison to fibronectin isolated from early-passage cells, fibronectin from late-passage cells bound poorly to native collagen types I and II. No differences were observed in the binding of the two <b>fibronectins</b> to denatured collagen. The binding of both <b>fibronectins</b> to native collagen was similarly promoted by heparin. Cell binding activity was evaluated by using a Boyden chamber assay to measure chemotaxis in response to either fibronectin. No differences were detected in cell binding. Comparisons of molecular weights by NaDodSO 4 /polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis reveals that fibronectin from late-passage cells is larger than that from early-passage cells. That difference is observed both in <b>fibronectins</b> isolated from conditioned media and in <b>fibronectins</b> isolated from the cell layer.

40|$|<b>Fibronectins</b> are a {{large family}} of {{extracellular}} matrix proteins that regulate cell adhesion, migration, differentiation and survival. Different isoforms of fibronectin arise via alternative splicing of the transcript of a single gene. Although many of the general functions of <b>fibronectins</b> have been elucidated, few specific functions of the alternatively spliced isoforms have been described. Studies of the expression patterns of the splice isoforms show that these proteins are present at high levels during embryonic development.

Polyacrylamide-gel electrophoresis of material heated in sodium dodecyl sulphate and 2 -mercaptoethanol shows two prominent polypeptide subunits of approx. mol. wts. 215 000 and 200 000, with variable amounts of lower-molecular-weight fragments. The unexpected polypeptide heterogeneity of different preparations of hamster <b>fibronectins</b> and bovine serum fibronectin is shown to be partly an artefact and is generated during isolation and storage of purified fibronectin. Treatment of each hamster fibronectin subunit or a smaller fragment of approx. mol. wt. 140 000 with thermolysin or trypsin after radioiodination produces similar patterns of tyrpsine-containing peptides, indicating similar primary amino-acid sequences.

We conclude that the various forms of hamster <b>fibronectins</b> are structurally analogous in agreement with indistinguishable biological properties in mediating the substance adhesion of BKH cells [Pena & Hughes (1978) Cell Biol. Int. Rep. 3, 339 - 344]...|$|E
40|$|<b>Fibronectins</b> are {{widespread}} {{extracellular matrix}} and body fluid glycoproteins, capable of multiple interactions with cell surfaces and other matrix components. Their structure at {{a molecular level}} has been resolved, yet {{there are still many}} unanswered questions regarding their biologic activity in vivo. Much data suggests that <b>fibronectins</b> may promote extracellular matrix assembly, and cell adhesion to those matrices. However, one outstanding enigma is that <b>fibronectins</b> may, under different circumstances, promote both cell migration and anchorage. An analysis of the interaction of fibroblasts with proteolytically derived and purified domains of plasma fibronectin revealed that the type of adhesion and the correlated cytoskeletal organization depended on multiple interactions of fibronectin domains with the cell surface. Human dermal fibroblasts were capable of interacting with the integrin-binding domain and both heparin-binding domains of the plasma fibronectin molecule and their interactions determined the type of adhesion. The same principle was seen in a study of the ability of plasma fibronectin to promote basement membrane assembly in an endodermal cell line, PF-HR 9. There also, interactions of both heparin- and integrin-binding domains combined to promote the deposition of a proteoglycan, laminin, and type IV collagen-containing basement membrane matrix. The underlying conclusion from our studies is, therefore, that <b>fibronectins</b> may, through their different isotypes, multiple receptors, and varying interaction of one or more domains with those receptors, result in a spectrum of responses in different cell types. The molecular details of this array of biologic activities is not resolved but is the target of much current research...|$|E
40|$|Exogenous plasma and {{endogenous}} cellular <b>fibronectins</b> on {{the surface}} of cultured fibroblasts and in extracellular matrix fibrils were colocalized by fluorescent and high voltage immunoelectron microscopy. Fibroblast cultures grown in {{the presence or absence of}} cycloheximide were incubated with exogenous plasma fibronectin labeled with fluorescein isothiocyanate. A monoclonal antibody specific for the EIIIA sequence of cellular fibronectin was used to detect cellular fibronectin. A rabbit antifluorescein antibody identified fluoresceinated plasma fibronectin. In cultures incubated in the presence of cycloheximide, plasma fibronectin was bound to the cell surface and was assembled into extracellular fibrils. In cultures grown in the absence of cycloheximide, plasma and cellular <b>fibronectins</b> were observed in the same matrix fibrils and in the same locations on the cell surface. There was not, however, random admixture of the two proteins...|$|E
40|$|Affinity {{chromatography}} with actin-Sepharose conjugates of purified human <b>fibronectin,</b> {{normal human}} plasma, or serum-free culture fluid from human fibroblasts showed that <b>fibronectin</b> molecules can directly bind to actin. A quantitative recovery of soluble human <b>fibronectin</b> {{was accomplished by}} chromatography on actin immobilized on Sepharose beads. Human <b>fibronectin</b> molecules bound to actin-Sepharose were eluted with 0. 25 - 0. 35 M potassium bromide, and these molecules competed in a species-specific radioimmunoassay for human <b>fibronectin.</b> The subunits of <b>fibronectin</b> isolated by actin-Sepharose chromatography comigrated in SDS polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis with those of electrophoretically homogeneous <b>fibronectin</b> purified by conventional procedures. The efficient direct binding of <b>fibronectin</b> to actin suggests that interactions between these proteins might also take place in vivo but further {{studies are needed to}} elucidate the biological significance of this affinity. <b>Fibronectin</b> is a major fibroblast surface glycoprotei...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fibronectin</b> {{is a large}} {{glycoprotein}} of plasma, tissue {{fluids and}} tissues. The rat air pouch model of mesenchymal inflammation {{was used to examine}} changes in <b>fibronectin</b> levels during inflammation within a mesenchymal cavity. Rat plasma <b>fibronectin</b> levels showed a rapid and significant rise in relation to the induction of an air pouch. In contrast pouch fluid <b>fibronectin</b> levels were initially low and gradually increased with chronicity. They were unrelated to plasma levels. Pouch fluid <b>fibronectin</b> showed no relationship to cell content of the fluid, its volume, nor the weight of granulation tissue. Two-dimensional immuno-electrophoresis showed pouch fluid <b>fibronectin</b> was partially complexed but plasma <b>fibronectin</b> was not. These results show plasma and tissue fluid <b>fibronectin</b> have different patterns of response to inflammation. In rats plasma <b>fibronectin</b> is an acute-phase reactant, although {{this is not the case}} in humans...|$|R
40|$|Plasma <b>fibronectin</b> was {{depleted}} within 15 min following sublethal burn, {{followed by}} partial recovery at 8 h and complete restoration by 24 h in anesthetized rats. Radiolabeled 75 Se-plasma <b>fibronectin,</b> injected intravenously before burn, was rapidly sequestered in burn skin {{as well as}} the liver. <b>Fibronectin</b> levels at 2 h postburn as detected by immunoassay vs. 75 Se-plasma <b>fibronectin</b> indicated that more <b>fibronectin</b> was in the plasma than detected by electroimmunoassay. Crossed immunoelectrophoretic analysis of <b>fibronectin</b> in early postburn plasma demonstrated a reduced electrophoretic mobility of the <b>fibronectin</b> antigen. Addition of heparin or fibrin, both of which have affinity for <b>fibronectin,</b> to normal plasma was unable to reproduce this altered <b>fibronectin</b> electrophoretic pattern. In contrast, addition of gelatin or native collagen to normal plasma reproduced the abnormal electrophoretic pattern of <b>fibronectin</b> seen in burn plasma. Extracts of burned skin, but not extracts of normal skin, when added to normal plasma, elicited a similar altered electrophoretic pattern for <b>fibronectin.</b> By gel filtration, <b>fibronectin</b> in burn plasma had an apparent molecular weight approximately 40 % greater than that observed in normal plasma. These data suggest the release into the blood of a gelatinlike ligand from burned skin, which complexes with plasma <b>fibronectin.</b> Thus, <b>fibronectin</b> deficiency acutely postburn appears mediated by (a) its accumulation at the site of burn injury; (b) its removal from the circulation by the liver; and (c) its presence in the plasma in a form that is less detectable by immunoassay...|$|R
