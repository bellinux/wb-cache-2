The Lithuanian litas participated in ERM II since 28 June 2004, and was pegged to the euro {{at a rate of}} 3.45280 litai = €1. Lithuania originally set 1 January 2007 as their target date for joining the euro, and in March 2006 requested that the European Commission and the European Central Bank conduct an assessment on their readiness to adopt the currency. The Commission's report found that while Lithuania met four of the five criteria, their average annual inflation was 2.7%, exceeding the limit of 2.6%. As a result, the Commission concluded that [...] "there should be no change at present to Lithuania's status as a Member State with a derogation." [...] Lithuania is the only country initially to have been denied approval to adopt the euro after requesting a convergence check.|$|E
