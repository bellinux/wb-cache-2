5|$|The {{apex of the}} Counter-Reformation {{activity}} had <b>fallen</b> <b>on</b> {{the turn}} of the 17th century, the earlier years of the reign of Sigismund III Vasa (Zygmunt III Waza), who in cooperation with the Jesuits and some other Church circles attempted to strengthen the power of his monarchy. The King tried to limit access to higher offices to Catholics. Anti-Protestant riots took place in some cities. During the Sandomierz Rebellion of 1606 the Protestants supported the anti-King opposition in large numbers. Nevertheless, the massive wave of szlachta's return to Catholicism could not have been stopped.|$|E

5|$|Elizabeth Cresswell (c. 1625– c. 1698), {{also known}} as Mother Creswell and Madam Cresswell of Clerkenwell, {{was one of the}} most {{successful}} prostitutes and brothel keepers of the English seventeenth century. Starting with houses in Bartholomew Close, in the City of London and St Leonard's, Shoreditch, she built a widespread network of brothels across London, supplied with girls and women from across England. Her employees included the wives of soldiers pressed into service for Charles II and gentlewomen who had supported the Cavalier cause during the English Civil War and had since <b>fallen</b> <b>on</b> hard times. Her bawdy houses were favoured by King Charles and his court as well as powerful figures in government and city guilds. This position gave her a measure of immunity from prosecution and added to her profile as a caricature of iniquity and corruption.|$|E
5|$|At 08:20 on {{the morning}} of 25 July the Chinese again {{assaulted}} the US Marines on Hill 119 in company strength but were soon halted by American artillery and mortar fire which inflicted heavy losses; skirmishing continued {{for the remainder of the}} day. While no major assaults against Hill 111 occurred, a heavy barrage by the Chinese targeted the position at 11:00. F9F Panthers provided air support to the Marines throughout the day, while American tanks continued to engage Chinese targets in support of the defenders on Hill 111 and Boulder City. Finally, at 13:35 the last of the Chinese infantry were forced off the forward slopes of Boulder City by the US Marines. Chinese casualties were estimated by the Americans to have included another 75 killed and 425 wounded. The Chinese continued to heavily shell the American positions, and by late afternoon 13,500 mortar and artillery rounds had <b>fallen</b> <b>on</b> the sector held by US 7th Marine Regiment. The Americans fired many counter-battery missions in response, firing 36,794 rounds. The ongoing relief of the US 7th Marine Regiment continued throughout the day. Meanwhile, the Australian positions on The Hook were also heavily shelled throughout the day, forcing many of the defenders underground into the network of tunnels then being extended by a team of New Zealand sappers.|$|E
5|$|At the hearing, new {{evidence}} was heard, that heavy rain had <b>fallen</b> <b>on</b> the ship {{on the second}} day of the killings, but a third batch of slaves was killed after that. This led Mansfield to order another trial, because the rainfall meant that the killing of those slaves, after the water shortage had been eased, could not be justified in terms of the greater necessity of saving the ship and the rest of its human cargo. One of the justices in attendance also said that this evidence invalidated the findings of the jury in the first trial, as the jury had heard testimony that the water shortage resulted from the poor condition of the ship, brought on by unforeseen maritime conditions, rather than from errors committed by its captain. Mansfield concluded that the insurers were not liable for losses resulting from errors committed by Zong crew.|$|E

5|$|Horses appear {{frequently}} in accounts concerning miraculous {{events in the}} context of Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 7th century, a horse is reported to have revealed warm bread and some meat when St Cuthbert was hungry, by pulling straw from the roof of a hut; and, when Cuthbert was suffering from a diseased knee, he was visited by an angel on horseback, who helped him to heal his knee. In the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon Bishop Willibald of Eichstätt wrote that, when a source of fresh water was needed for a monastery on the site where St Boniface had died, in the kingdom of Frisia, the ground gave way under the forelegs of a horse, and, when the horse was pulled free, a fountain of spring water came out of the ground and formed a brook. In the 10th century, King Edmund I is reported to have been saved from death while chasing a deer on horseback when he prayed for forgiveness for his maltreatment of St Dunstan, and thereafter made him abbot of Glastonbury: the horse stopped {{at the edge of a}} cliff, over which the deer and hunting dogs had already <b>fallen.</b> <b>On</b> a later occasion, a horse fell dead under Dunstan when he heard a voice from heaven telling him that King Eadred had died.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to rain and flooding, winds damaged more homes and businesses, and a tornado was spawned {{a few miles}} southwest of Port Arthur. More than 19,000power outages were reported in the area near where Bonnie made landfall. Texas State Highway 87 was closed in Jefferson County due to debris and electrical poles <b>fallen</b> <b>on</b> the roadway. The storm left broken windows, scattered tree limbs, and debris filled streets in Port Arthur and Beaumont. At the latter, strong winds toppled a radio tower at the Texas Department of Public Safety building, while several schools suffered damage to the roof and windows. Marinas and boats at Lake Sam Rayburn were damaged. Hank Creek Marina, located across the lake, broke free from its moorings and floated away, while portions of were submerged. Four indirect fatalities were confirmed in Texas, two from traffic accidents, one from a house fire ignited by a candle, and another from drowning. Several injuries were also reported, including four after a truck flipped over due to strong winds.|$|E
5|$|In the 17th century, chief {{architect}} and Surveyor-General to James I, Inigo Jones, surveyed {{the area and}} introduced the local Portland stone to London; using it in his Banqueting House, Whitehall, and for repairs on St Paul's Cathedral. His successor, Sir Christopher Wren, the architect and Member of Parliament for nearby Weymouth, used six million tons of white Portland limestone to rebuild destroyed parts of the capital after the Great Fire of London of 1666. Well-known buildings in the capital, including St Paul's Cathedral and the eastern front of Buckingham Palace feature the stone. After the First World War, a quarry was opened by The Crown Estate to provide stone for the Cenotaph in Whitehall and half a million gravestones for war cemeteries, and after the Second World War {{hundreds of thousands of}} gravestones were hewn for soldiers who had <b>fallen</b> <b>on</b> the Western Front. Portland cement {{has nothing to do with}} Portland; it was so named due to its similar colour to Portland stone when mixed with lime and sand.|$|E

5|$|July 9, 1861 {{was a hot}} day, and Fanny {{was putting}} locks of her children's hair into an {{envelope}} and attempting to seal it with hot sealing wax while Longfellow took a nap. Her dress suddenly caught fire, though it is unclear exactly how; burning wax or a lighted candle may have fallen onto it. Longfellow was awakened from his nap and rushed to help her, throwing a rug over her, though it was too small. He stifled the flames with his body as best he could, but she was already badly burned. Over half a century later, Longfellow's youngest daughter Annie explained the story differently, claiming {{that there had been}} no candle or wax but that the fire had started from a self-lighting match that had <b>fallen</b> <b>on</b> the floor. Both accounts state that Fanny was taken to her room to recover and a doctor was called. She {{was in and out of}} consciousness throughout the night and was administered ether. She died shortly after 10:00 the next morning, July 10, after requesting a cup of coffee. Longfellow, in trying to save her, had burned himself badly enough so that he was unable to attend her funeral. His facial injuries led him to stop shaving, and he wore a beard from then on that became his trademark.|$|E
5|$|The Chinese also {{launched}} several assaults in {{the central}} sector against the US 5th Marine Regiment, commanded by Colonel Harvey C. Tschirgi. Successively striking outposts on the regimental right flank from 21:15, a reinforced Chinese company from the 408th Regiment then concentrated against outpost Esther, held by Marines from Company H. Amid heavy fighting both sides were reinforced. By early morning the Chinese had seized parts of the forward American trench-line and moved to isolate the position with indirect fire and patrols which penetrated between the outpost and the main defensive position to the rear; the Marines still controlled the rear trenches and, reorganising their defence, succeeded in checking the Chinese assault. Defending strongly, the Marines used flamethrowers, machine-guns and mortars, supported by M46 Patton tanks and artillery fire and following several hours of fighting the Chinese attack was finally broken up by indirect fire. An entire Chinese battalion had been committed piecemeal to the attack, yet by 06:40 the following day the US Marines reported Esther secure. More than 4,000 artillery and mortar rounds had <b>fallen</b> <b>on</b> the outpost during the night; Marine casualties included 12 killed and 35 wounded, while Chinese loses included 85 dead which were counted around the position, 110 more believed killed and an estimated 250 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The film {{opened in}} 4,088 theaters {{including}} a then-record total of 2,789 3D locations.

This was the sixth-best opening Wednesday. However, all these figures {{were lower than}} Revenge of the <b>Fallen.</b> <b>On</b> Thursday, it earned $21.5 million, falling 43%, an improvement from its predecessor's Wednesday-to-Thursday decline. It grossed $33.0 million on Friday totaling $97.8 million. Its 3D share accounted for 60% of its gross, which was atypical due to the downturn in 3D attendance in North America. For its three-day opening weekend (Friday-to-Sunday), it grossed $97.9 million. It achieved the third-largest opening weekend of 2011, the fourth-largest opening weekend in July, the fifth-largest opening weekend for a film not released on Friday and the second-largest five-day gross for a film opening on Wednesday. It set records for the 3-day ($97.9 million) and 4-day ($115.9 million) Independence Day weekend, surpassing Spider-Man 2 record in both cases ($88.2 million and $115.8 million respectively). It retained first place on its second weekend, dropping 52% to $47.1 million. Closing on October 13, 2011 with $352.4 million, it is the second-highest-grossing film of 2011 and the second-highest-grossing film in the franchise.|$|E

5|$|The {{situation}} on 27 May had changed considerably from just 24 hours earlier. The Belgian Army {{had been forced}} from the Leie line on 26 May, and Nevele, Vynckt, Tielt and Iseghem had <b>fallen</b> <b>on</b> the western and {{central part of the}} Leie front. In the east, the Germans had reached the outskirts of Bruges, and captured Ursel. In the west, the Menen–Ypres line had broken at Kortrijk and the Belgians were now using railway trucks to help form anti-tank defences on a line from Ypres–Passchendaele–Roulers. Further to the west the BEF had been forced back, north of Lille just over the French border and was now in danger of allowing a gap to develop between themselves and the Belgian southern flank on the Ypres–Lille axis. The danger in allowing a German advance to Dunkirk would mean the loss of the port which was now too great. The British withdrew to the port on 26 May. In doing so, they left the French 1st Army's north-eastern flank near Lille exposed. As the British moved out, the Germans moved in, encircling the bulk of the French Army. Both Gort and his Chief of Staff, General Henry Pownall, accepted that their withdrawal would mean the destruction of the French 1st Army, and they would be blamed for it.|$|E
