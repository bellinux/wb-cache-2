In the episode, Homer begins to bond with his daughter, Lisa, after learning her unique and convenient ability to pick winning football teams, but, secretly, uses her ability to help him gamble.

500|$|The film's {{experimental}} plot and dense dialogue were controversially received. Esquires Mike D'Angelo claimed that [...] "anybody who claims <b>he</b> <b>fully</b> <b>understands</b> what's {{going on in}} Primer after seeing it just once is either a [...] or a liar". Scott Tobias writes for The A.V. Club: [...] "The banter is heavy on technical jargon and almost perversely short on exposition; {{were it not for}} the presence of voiceover narration, the film would be close to incomprehensible." [...] For the Los Angeles Times, Carina Chocano writes: [...] "sticklers for linear storytelling are bound to be frustrated by narrative threads that start promisingly, then just sort of fall off the spool". Some reviewers were entirely put off by the film's obfuscated narrative. Kirk Honeycutt of The Hollywood Reporter complained that Primer [...] "nearly gets lost in a miasma of technical jargon and scientific conjecture".|$|E

50|$|A third {{theme is}} who deserved, or accepted, {{responsibility}} for {{the wreck of the}} RMS Titanic. Captain Smith, a veteran White Star captain nearing retirement, is depicted as a masterful leader who nevertheless failed to slow down in spite of being well aware that he was traveling into ice-laden waters. Shipbuilder Thomas Andrews radiates an almost saintly quality, seeing to the final details of construction and repairs himself, tenderly looking after passengers and crew, and even conversing with a young stewardess about their common hometown of Belfast. <b>He</b> <b>fully</b> <b>understands</b> the implications of the collision, and his knowledge that he cannot save the ship clearly breaks his heart. Meanwhile, White Star Line owner J. Bruce Ismay wavers between a stance of command and an unwillingness to take {{responsibility for the}} sinking. Identifying himself as a passenger, he defiantly boards a lifeboat, only to experience a nervous breakdown aboard the RMS Carpathia. Ismay is the only one of these three men who survives, and it is clear that he will never fully recover from the sinking.|$|E

He had his own arm cut off after it became limp since he believed it would become a distraction during a fight, and has shown that he is a bit of a hot head getting lost in the heat of battle and not wanting to stop even if it was not his prime objective. He is an expert in mera (fire) spells but only uses them to increase the power of his fists. In the final part of the story, Hym discovers he actually is the reincarnation of his master, acquiring Hadlar's silver hair and the ability to generate Touki as an organic being.|$|E

He also has command intuitively, if not self consciously, of certain special classes of examples and heuristic advice. At least three broad categories of information are necessary to represent mathematical knowledge: results which contain the traditional logical aspects of mathematics, i. e., theorems and proofs; examples which contain illustrative material; and concepts which include mathematical definitions and heuristic advice. Just as results can be structured by the relation of logical deduction in which A [...] > B means that result A is used to prove result B, examples and concepts can also be organized by relations. Examples can be ordered by the relation of fabricational derivation in which A-•> B means that example A is used to construct example B. For instance, the Cantor function is fabricated from the Cantor set, which in turn is fabricated from the unit interval. Concepts can be structured by the relation of pedagogical ordering which embodies the pedagogical judgement that concept A should be introduced before concept B. These three fundamental categories of items together with the special relations define three representation spaces for a mathematical theory: Re suits-space, Examples-space, Concepts-space...|$|E
