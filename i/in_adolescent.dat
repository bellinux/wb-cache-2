5|$|There {{does not}} appear to be a {{difference}} in motivation for self-harm <b>in</b> <b>adolescent</b> males and females. For example, for both genders there is an incremental increase in deliberate self-harm associated with an increase in consumption of cigarettes, drugs and alcohol. Triggering factors such as low self-esteem and having friends and family members who self-harm are also common between both males and females. One limited study found that, among those young individuals who do self-harm, both genders are just as equally likely to use the method of skin-cutting. However, females who self-cut are more likely than males to explain their self-harm episode by saying that they had wanted to punish themselves. In New Zealand, more females are hospitalised for intentional self-harm than males. Females more commonly choose methods such as self-poisoning that generally are not fatal, but still serious enough to require hospitalisation.|$|E

In {{the course of}} the study, we identified, analyzed and compared irrational beliefs <b>in</b> <b>adolescents</b> with behavioral deviations and <b>in</b> <b>adolescents</b> with socially acceptable, adaptive behavior. The theoretical part of the paper dwells on the concept of “irrational attitudes”, the research hypothesis on the impact of irrational attitudes on the formation of deviant behavior <b>in</b> <b>adolescents</b> is proved. The empirical part of the article describes the overall strategy and the circumstances of the study, as well as the results obtained. The analysis of empirical data presented in the article shows that there are some differences in the irrational attitudes <b>in</b> <b>adolescents</b> with socially acceptable behavior and <b>in</b> <b>adolescents</b> with behavioral problems. The revealed differences may well form the basis for further theoretical interpretations and empirical research...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: This study {{adds to the}} {{knowledge}} on somatization <b>in</b> <b>adolescents</b> by exploring its relation with parenting behavior and the mediating/moderating role of physiological responses <b>in</b> <b>adolescents</b> to parenting behavior. Method: Eighteen adolescents with high and 18 adolescents with low somatization scores and their mothers completed a discussion task, from which observed parenting behavior scores were derived. Skin conductance <b>in</b> <b>adolescents</b> was measured {{before and during the}} discussion. Results: For adolescents with high levels of physiological responses, unadaptive parenting was related to a higher chance of high somatization scores. For low physiologically responsive adolescents, the relation between parenting behavior and somatization was not significant. Conclusion: Parenting behavior is not univocally related to somatization <b>in</b> <b>adolescents,</b> but the association depends on physiological responses <b>in</b> <b>adolescents.</b> (C) 2014 Elsevier B.

40|$|Cigarette smoking <b>in</b> the <b>adolescent</b> {{population}} {{remains a}} public health concern. A {{significant portion of the}} adolescent population currently uses tobacco. Nicotine is particularly addicting <b>in</b> <b>adolescents,</b> and quitting is difficult. The goals for adolescent cigarette smoking efforts must include both primary prevention and smoking cessation. Bupropion and nicotine replacement therapies—including nicotine patches, gum, and nasal spray—have been studied to a limited extent <b>in</b> the <b>adolescent</b> population. Varenicline has not been evaluated as a treatment modality <b>in</b> <b>adolescents.</b> Long-term quit rates in the pharmacotherapy trials have not been optimal; however, decreases in cigarettes smoked per day have been observed. Several evidencebased guidelines include recommendations for smoking cessation <b>in</b> <b>adolescents</b> that include counseling and pharmacotherapy. Pharmacotherapy may be instituted for some <b>adolescents</b> <b>in</b> addition to counseling and behavioral interventions. Therapy should be individualized, based on smoking patterns, patient preferences, and concomitant disease states. Smoking cessation support for parents should be instituted as well. The pharmacist can play a large role <b>in</b> helping the <b>adolescent</b> quit smoking. Further studies evaluating pharmacotherapy options for smoking cessation <b>in</b> <b>adolescents</b> are necessary.

25|$|However, a {{significant}} portion of testosterone <b>in</b> <b>adolescent</b> boys is converted to estradiol. Estradiol mediates the growth spurt, bone maturation, and epiphyseal closure in boys just as in girls.

Suicide is also very common <b>in</b> <b>adolescent</b> alcohol abusers, with 1 in 4 suicides in adolescents being related to alcohol abuse.

Another study indicated that dysmenorrhea was present in 36.4% of participants, and was significantly associated with lower age and lower parity. Childbearing is said to relieve dysmenorrhea, but this does not always occur. One study indicated that in nulliparous women with primary dysmenorrhea, the severity of menstrual pain decreased significantly after age 40.
