5|$|The fleet did {{not leave}} Spithead until 16 November, the {{departure}} <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> {{until late in the}} season. The delay proved disastrous: two days after departing, a westerly gale blew up, dispersing the fleet and driving the ships back to port. Several of the merchantmen were wrecked with heavy loss of life; over 200 bodies washed up on the coastline between Portland and Bridport.|$|E
5|$|As {{invasion}} neared in mid-1944, the two battalions {{moved from}} their camps to ports in southern England and embarked aboard troopships and landing ship tanks. Much of the Liverpool Irish embarked aboard the Ulster Monarch, a passenger ship that had {{served on the}} Belfast-Liverpool line before the war. <b>Having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed,</b> the invasion fleet proceeded to Normandy on 5 June. Both King's battalions landed on D-Day, the 5th at Sword with the 3rd British Infantry Division and the Liverpool Irish at Juno with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{outcome is}} unknown, {{since it has}} two {{versions}} which differ depending on the source. In the first version Nikola Jurišić rejected the offer to surrender on favourable terms, {{and in the second}} version, the city was offered terms for a nominal surrender. Suleiman, <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> nearly four weeks, withdrew at the arrival of the August rains, and did not continue towards Vienna as he had intended, but turned homeward.|$|E

5|$|At the time, Akersbanerne {{was working}} on {{building}} the Lambertseter Line, which is located further east in Aker. This caused an uproar amongst the residents in the Ekeberg area, who wanted the Ekeberg Line extended, in {{what became known as}} the thousand meter, before the construction of the Lambertseter Line. The municipality therefore granted free municipal land and a grant of NOK50,000 for expropriation. Construction started in July 1940, after <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> by the German occupation of Norway. The construction included a new double track from Holtet to Bråten. During the construction at Sæter, the trams turned at Bråten and backed to Sæter, where they used the turning loop. The thousand meter extension to Ljabru opened on 17 September 1941.|$|E
5|$|<b>Having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> {{several times}} by poor weather, Operation Cobra {{commenced}} on 25 July, with a concentrated aerial bombardment {{from thousands of}} Allied aircraft. Supporting offensives had drawn the bulk of German armored reserves toward the British and Canadian sector and coupled with the general lack of men and materiel available to the Germans, {{it was impossible for}} them to form successive lines of defense. Units of the U. S. VII Corps led the initial two-division assault, while other First Army corps mounted supporting attacks designed to pin German units in place. Progress was slow on the first day but opposition started to crumble once the defensive crust had been broken. By 27 July, most organized resistance had been overcome and the VII and VIII Corps advanced rapidly, isolating the Cotentin peninsula.|$|E

5|$|Planning began for {{the third}} U.S. orbital mission in February 1962, aiming for a six-or-seven-orbit flight {{to build on the}} {{previous}} three-orbit missions. NASA officially announced the mission on June 27, and the flight plan was finalized in late July. The mission focused on engineering tests rather than on scientific experimentation. The mission finally launched on the morning of October 3, <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> two weeks because of problems with the Atlas booster. A series of minor booster problems during launch and a faulty temperature controller in Schirra's pressure suit were the only technical problems noted during the flight. The spacecraft orbited in both automated and passive flight modes for prolonged periods while the pilot monitored it and carried out some minor scientific experiments. After six orbits, the capsule landed in the Pacific Ocean half a mile from the recovery carrier, and was hoisted aboard for Schirra to disembark.|$|E
25|$|The GPK {{opened a}} section at its {{southern}} end on 19 July 1839 between Irvine and Ayr (Newton-on-Ayr), {{and it started}} operation on the Joint Line on 14 July 1840 from a temporary station at Glasgow (Bridge Street) to Paisley. The GP opened in March 1841, <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> due to the difficulties {{in the construction of}} the tunnel at Bishopton.|$|E
25|$|The line reached Bermondsey Street in October, and London Bridge on 14 December 1836 (Spa Road was {{no longer}} used as a stop at this time). At the other end, the line reached a {{temporary}} station at Church Row in Greenwich on 24 December 1838, <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> by problems with the Deptford Creek lift bridge. The present Greenwich station opened on 12 April 1840.|$|E

25|$|Davout's {{artillery}} arrived about 3:00 pm, <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> by a staff blunder. Backed by artillery {{support for}} the first time, the tired French infantry retook the first ridge. An artillery colonel scouted the woods on the Austrian right flank and found a promising position to post his guns. When he reported his discovery to Saint-Hilaire, the two improvised a new attack. Saint-Hilaire waved his men forward in a new frontal attack while a horse artillery battery slipped into position unnoticed by the Austrians.|$|E
25|$|L6844 first flew on 11 October 1938, {{construction}} <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> chiefly {{due to the}} {{new features}} and {{also because of the}} late delivery of the engines. L6844 was passed to RAE Farnborough {{at the end of the}} year, while further service trials were later carried out at Martlesham Heath. The Whirlwind exhibited excellent handling characteristics and proved to be very easy to fly at all speeds. The only exception was the inadequate directional control during take-off which necessitated an increased rudder area above the tailplane.|$|E
25|$|In 2008, {{plans were}} {{announced}} for a Roy Harper tribute album. The album, What You Need Is What You Have, The Songs of Roy Harper was being compiled by Laurel Canyon folk singer, musician and producer Jonathan Wilson, and was to feature Chris Robinson (the Black Crowes), Gary Louris (the Jayhawks), Johnathan Rice, Eric Johnson (Fruit Bats, the Shins), Benji Hughes, Will Oldham, Andy Cabic, Dawes, Jenny O., Josh Tillman and others. At present, the collection remains unfinished, <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> beyond its planned 2009 release date. Six {{of the tracks}} can be heard on the project's Myspace page.|$|E

25|$|The {{album was}} {{released}} on 31 March 1976, <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> by {{the completion of the}} album sleeve. In Britain it attained one of the highest ever advance orders, shipping gold on the day of release. It entered at #2 and peaked the following week at #1 on the US Billboard Pop Albums chart and entered at #24 on the Cashbox Top 100 Albums, before rising to #1 the following week. However, this album is the lowest selling of their careers, and it received lukewarm reviews upon its release. In late 1976 the album was also overshadowed by the release of the band's movie and soundtrack The Song Remains the Same.|$|E
25|$|The besiegers battery fire dwindled {{slightly}} but {{the powder}} and ammunition {{began to run}} low in the fort, Paredes then sent for reinforcements to Juan Aguila. Despite the protests of Mercœur, Águila decided to send a relief force {{in order to avoid}} a defeat. Águila's relief force started off <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> because he did not have cavalry, but continued on with 4,000 infantry and two pieces of artillery. The French cavalry force armed with arquebusiers numbering 300 made frequent attacks delaying Águila further. Aumont received news of Águila's relief force and ordered the besiegers to double their efforts in particular putting pressure on the miners to complete the mining for detonation and to launch an immediate assault.|$|E
25|$|The Microsoft Windows {{version of}} the game was {{released}} in Europe in September 2006. The North American version was not released until June 2007, <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> {{so as to be}} released alongside the Xbox 360 port. However, Techland used the time to make some changes to the game; unlike the European version, which only supported DirectX 9.0c and was intended to run on Windows 2000 or Windows XP, the North American version was optimized for Windows Vista and DirectX 10, one of the first PC games optimized for the new operating system. Shortly after the release of the North American version, Techland released a DirectX 10 enhancement patch for all versions of the game.|$|E

25|$|Kautz's men did {{not arrive}} until noon, however, <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> en route by {{numerous}} enemy pickets. They assaulted the Dimmock Line where it crossed the Jerusalem Plank Road (present-day U.S. Route 301, Crater Road). The Confederates' Battery 27, also known as Rives's Salient, was manned by 150 militiamen commanded by Maj. Fletcher H. Archer. Kautz first launched a probing attack, then paused. His main attack was by the 11th Pennsylvania Cavalry against the Home Guard, a group consisting primarily of teenagers, elderly men, and some wounded soldiers from city hospitals. The Home Guards retreated to the city with heavy losses, but by this time Beauregard {{had been able to}} bring reinforcements from Richmond to bear, which were able to repulse the Union assault. Kautz, hearing no activity on Gillmore's front, presumed that he was left on his own and withdrew. Confederate casualties were about 80, Union 40. Butler was furious with Gillmore's timidity and incompetence and arrested him. Gillmore requested a court of inquiry, which was never convened, but Grant later reassigned him and the incident was dropped.|$|E
500|$|Aurora left Hobart on 24 December 1914, <b>having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> in Australia by {{financial}} and organizational problems. [...] The arrival in McMurdo Sound on 15 January 1915 was {{later in the}} season than planned, but the party’s commander Aeneas Mackintosh made immediate plans for a depot-laying journey on the Ross Ice Shelf, since he understood [...] that Shackleton hoped to attempt the crossing [...] during that first season. Neither the men nor the dogs were acclimatised, and the party was, as a whole, very inexperienced in ice conditions. [...] The first journey on the ice resulted in the loss of ten of the party’s 18dogs [...] and a frostbitten and generally demoralised shore party; a single, incomplete depot was their only achievement.|$|E
500|$|The film {{received}} its worldwide premiere in London in July 1968, {{by which time}} the Beatles were busy working on their eponymous double album, The Beatles, commonly called [...] "the White Album". Ultimately, the Beatles were enthusiastic about the finished film, and did more to associate themselves with it after release. <b>Having</b> <b>been</b> <b>delayed</b> {{so that it would}} not clash with the release of The Beatles, and to allow for the re-recording of Martin's contributions, Yellow Submarine was issued by Apple Records on 13 January 1969 in the US and on 17 January in the UK. The album was issued in stereo only in the US, while the UK album was available in both stereo and mono, although the mono version is simply a fold-down (a combination of two stereo channels into one mono) rather than a specific mix.|$|E
