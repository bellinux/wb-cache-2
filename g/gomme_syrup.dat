5000|$|<b>Gomme</b> <b>syrup</b> (or gum syrup; gomme is French for [...] "gum") is an {{ingredient}} {{commonly used in}} mixed drinks. It is also commonly used as a sweetener for iced coffee in Japan. Like bar syrups, it is a 2:1 sugar and water mixture, but has an added ingredient of gum arabic. <b>Gomme</b> <b>syrup</b> is made with the highest ratio of sugar to water possible, while the gum arabic prevents the sugar from crystallizing and adds a smooth texture.|$|E
5000|$|Take a big saucer {{champagne}} glass, put in 45 ml (1 jigger) {{either of}} dry or old Tom gin, 5 ml (1 tsp) <b>gomme</b> <b>syrup</b> or sugar, 2.5 ml ( [...] tsp) - to taste - of lime syrup or lime cordial.|$|E
5000|$|An early {{record of}} the {{cocktail}} {{can be found in}} William Schmidt's [...] "The Flowing Bowl", published in 1891. In it, he details a drink containing 2 dashes of gum (<b>gomme</b> <b>syrup),</b> 2 dashes of bitters, 1 dash of absinthe, 2/3 portion of whiskey and 1/3 portion of vermouth.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} {{he performed}} research of enzymes (invertin, rhamnodiastase) and enzyme mixtures (emulsin); {{did a study}} of sirop de <b>gomme</b> (gum <b>syrup)</b> and conducted investigations on the activity of certain glucosides in plant color changes during desiccation.|$|R
50|$|The drinker, pours a {{tea spoon}} of <b>gomme</b> <b>syrup,</b> soda water and vodka (or its equivalent). The rest {{is the same}} as a tequila slammer, the drinker places their palm on top of the shot glass, bangs the glass onto the table, then gulp down the {{cocktail}} before it overflows with the fizzing carbonated water.|$|E
5000|$|Like {{the story}} of its creation, there are several {{variations}} of the Ward 8 cocktail. Various recipes call for blended whiskey, bourbon, rye, and even single malt scotch. Some recipes call for lemon juice, lime juice, no juice, grenadine, sour mix, and <b>gomme</b> <b>syrup.</b> The Santa Clara Company trademark described their product as [...] "Compounds of Whisky, Grenadine-Syrup, Rock-Candy Syrup, and Lime-Juice." ...|$|E
50|$|The Zazarac is an American {{cocktail}} {{which may}} be related to the Sazerac, although it might have originated completely independent of the more famous drink. It is made with <b>gomme</b> <b>syrup</b> which has a much higher concentration of sugar than simple syrup, which some modern variations of the recipes replace it with; the addition of several types of bitters makes this a spicy drink.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are many}} ways to adhere salt, sugar, etc. to a rim. These could include <b>Gomme</b> <b>syrup,</b> simple syrup, maple syrup, lime, orange or lemon juice, caramel or {{chocolate}} sauce, marshmallow Crème, and in rare cases, water. Water is generally only used with very finely powdered choices, such as castor sugar, icing sugar, and finely ground spice items such as cinnamon sugar. In most cases the material that is used has a natural tack or stickiness before it dries, and continues to hold after it dries. Typically this is citrus juice, since this is readily available at a bar.|$|E
5000|$|By the 1860s, as {{illustrated}} by Jerry Thomas' 1862 book, basic cocktail recipes included Curaçao, or other liqueurs. These liqueurs were {{not mentioned in the}} early 19th century descriptions, nor the Chicago Daily Tribune descriptions of the [...] "Old Fashioned" [...] cocktails of the early 1880s; they were absent from Kappeler's Old Fashioned recipes as well. The differences of the Old Fashioned cocktail recipes from the cocktail recipes of the late 19th Century are mainly preparation method, the use of sugar and water in lieu of simple or <b>gomme</b> <b>syrup,</b> and the absence of additional liqueurs. These Old Fashioned cocktail recipes are literally for cocktails done the old-fashioned way.|$|E
50|$|The Brandy Daisy is a {{cocktail}} which first gained {{popularity in the}} late 19th century. One of the earliest known recipes was published in 1876 in the second edition of Jerry Thomas's The Bartenders Guide or How To Mix Drinks: The Bon-Vivants Companion: * 3 or 4 dashes gum syrup* 2 or 3 dashes of Curaçao liqueur* The juice of half a small lemon* 1 small wine-glass of brandy* 2 dashes of Jamaica rumFill glass one-third full of shaved ice. Shake well, strain into a large cocktail glass, and fill up with Seltzer water from a syphon. Over the years, multiple variants of the recipe developed, including other daisies involving other base spirits, such as whiskey or gin. The gin-based daisy, {{in at least one}} bartender's guide from the mid-1930s, is considered an early incarnation of the Cosmopolitan, a drink today well known as a citrus vodka-based concoction. Fresh citrus — typically lemon juice, but occasionally orange or lime juice — is common throughout most daisy recipes. Liqueurs or cordials also figure prominently, ranging from Curaçao to maraschino or yellow Chartreuse (a suggestion from the writer Nathaniel Gubbins in his 1899 book The Flowing Bowl), distinguishing the daisy from other sour cocktails. Additional sweeteners sometimes added range from <b>gomme</b> <b>syrup</b> to grenadine syrup, raspberry syrup, or bar sugar.|$|E
