5|$|At times, the coffers were full; in April 1764, {{near the}} end of the Paris sojourn and after two {{successful}} concerts, Leopold announced he would shortly be depositing 2,200 florins with his bankers. Two months later, after the initial London successes, Leopold banked a further 1,100 florins. However, in November of that year, after his illness and with uncertain earning prospects, he was worrying about the <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> living in Londonhe informed Hagenauer that he had spent 1,870 florins in the four-month period since July. The following summer, after little concert activity, Leopold resorted to increasingly desperate measures to raise funds, including the children's daily circus performances at the Swan and Harp Inn at prices described by Jane Glover as humiliating. The insecurity of travelling life led Leopold to believe, later, that Wolfgang was not worldly-wise enough to attempt such journeys alone, and needed to be anchored to an assured salary.|$|E
5|$|Coastal erosion {{remained}} a problem. By {{the middle of}} the century, the tides had reached the southern edge of the castle, and a 1866 report stated that the walls had been undermined by the sea. Despite protective piles being driven around the castle, it was badly affected by flooding in 1875 and 1878, creating serious fissures in the stonework. The <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> maintaining the property, combined with its dwindling utility, encouraged the government to sell the castle to the South Eastern Railway company in 1888, who intended {{to turn it into a}} railway station. It was then sold to private owners and a small museum was created in the castle, which was sometimes opened to the public for an entry price of one penny.|$|E

The notoriety of becoming the only city ever to decline to host an Olympiad after being selected has made subsequent bids difficult. The movement against hosting the games was based largely on environmental issues and was led by State Representative Richard Lamm, who was subsequently elected to three terms (1975–87) as Colorado governor. Denver explored a potential bid for the 2022 Winter Olympics, but no bid will be submitted.|$|E

5|$|In October 1885, the Halifax Wood Fibre Company {{built the}} first {{sulphide}} pulp mill in Canada, {{which at the time}} was the Dominion of Canada, at East River, Sheet Harbour. Since the discovery of the sulphite process happened earlier in 1866, the news had traveled to William Chisholm, who was a lumber manufacturer in Halifax. He decided to try the sulphite method out for himself {{at the head of the}} East River. He had 60,000 acres (24,281 hectares, or 242km2) of woodland on the Sheet Harbour rivers. The mill closed in January 1891, due to the <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> importing sulphide from the United States. The cookhouse which was used at the mill was bought by the residents of Watt Section and was floated down the harbour to the community.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} be effective, costly signals must fulfill {{specific}} criteria. Firstly, signallers must incur different levels of cost and benefit for signalling behaviour. Secondly, costs and benefits must reflect the signallers’ phenotypic quality. Thirdly, the information provided by a signal should be directed at and accessible to an audience. A receiver can be anyone who stands to benefit from information the signaller is sending, such as potential mates, allies, or competitors. Honesty is guaranteed when only individuals of high quality can pay the (<b>high)</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> signalling. Hence, costly signals {{make it impossible for}} low-quality individuals to fake a signal and fool a receiver.|$|E

5|$|Netley Castle is {{a former}} {{artillery}} fort constructed in either 1542 or 1544 by Henry VIII {{in the village of}} Netley, Hampshire. It formed part of the King's Device programme to protect against invasion from France and the Holy Roman Empire, and it defended Southampton Water near the Solent. The castle included a central, stone keep with two flanking gun platforms and was garrisoned by ten men. It was decommissioned during the English Civil War and by 1743 it was overgrown and in ruins. In the 19th century the property was gradually converted into a private house, being extended in a Gothic style, complete with octagonal towers. Between 1939 and 1998 it was used as a nursing home, until the <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> maintenance led to its closure. Following an archaeological survey, it was then converted into nine residential flats. It is protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
5|$|Several factors {{explain the}} poor results of XXIBomber Command's {{precision}} bombing campaign. The {{most important of}} these was the weather; the American raiders frequently encountered cloudy conditions and high winds over Japan which made accurate bombing extremely difficult. Moreover, the bomber forces often had to pass through severe weather fronts between the Mariana Islands and Japan, which broke up formations and caused navigation problems. XXIBomber Command's effectiveness was also limited by poor B-29 maintenance practices and over-crowding at its airfields – these factors reduced the number of aircraft which were available for operations and complicated the process of launching and recovering the bombers. By March 1945 the USAAF's commanders were highly concerned about the failure of the campaigns mounted from China and the Mariana Islands, and believed that the results to date made it difficult to justify the <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the B-29 program and also threatened their goal of demonstrating the effectiveness of independent air power.|$|E
5|$|Swiss {{citizens}} are universally required to {{buy health insurance}} from private insurance companies, which in turn are required to accept every applicant. While {{the cost of the}} system is among the highest, it compares well with other European countries in terms of health outcomes; patients who are citizens have been reported as being, in general, highly satisfied with it. In 2012, life expectancy at birth was 80.4 years for men and 84.7 years for women — the highest in the world. However, spending on health is particularly high at 11.4% of GDP (2010), on par with Germany and France (11.6%) and other European countries, but notably less than spending in the USA (17.6%). From 1990, a steady increase can be observed, reflecting the <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the services provided. With an ageing population and new healthcare technologies, health spending will likely continue to rise.|$|E

5|$|The castle {{had begun}} to suffer damage from the sea by the early 17th century, and {{by the middle of}} the 19th century, the {{receding}} coastline had reached the edge of the castle walls. The <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> repair contributed to the government's decision to sell the site off in 1888. It was initially bought by a railway company and then passed into private ownership. Coastal erosion continued and by the 1950s, the southern part of the castle had been destroyed by the sea. The remaining castle was restored between 1975 and 1979 by Peter and Barbara McGregor, who turned the keep into a private residence. In the 21st century, Sandgate remains in private ownership, and is protected under UK law as a grade I listed building.|$|E
5|$|The {{excavation}} {{and raising}} {{of the ship}} in the 1970s and early 1980s meant that diving operations ceased, even though modern scaffolding {{and part of the}} bow were left on the seabed. The pressure on conservators to treat tens of thousands of artefacts and the <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> conserving, storing and displaying the finds and the ship meant that there were no funds available for diving. In 2002, the UK Ministry of Defence announced plans to build two new aircraft carriers. Because of the massive size of the new vessels, the outlet from Portsmouth needed to be surveyed {{to make sure that they}} could sail no matter the tide. The planned route for the underwater channel ran close to the Mary Rose wrecksite, which meant that funding was supplied to survey and excavate the site once more. Even though the planned carriers were down-sized enough to not require alteration of Portsmouth outlet, the excavations had already exposed timbers and were completed in 2005. Among the most important finds was the ten-metre (32feet) stem, the forward continuation of the keel, which provided more exact details about the original profile of the ship.|$|E
5|$|The online {{functions}} {{planned for}} Nine {{were intended to}} be incorporated from release, but in August 2002, Atlus announced that they would divide the game in two parts: one stand-alone offline version, and one online version. The reason given for this was that the development team {{did not have enough}} time to integrate all online functions they wanted to include in the game, and that Atlus did not want to delay the game's release. Atlus planned to release the online version in 2002, but put development on hold due to the <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> developing an online game, and postponed the release until 2003. In August 2003, they announced that they no longer had any plans to publish the online version for Xbox, due to problems relating to network-based development and the profitability of online games. With the cancellation of the Xbox Live version, development continued on a version of Nine for Microsoft Windows personal computers (PCs). This version formed the base for what would become , a massively multiplayer online role-playing game for PCs developed by Cave and released in Japan and Western regions across 2007 and 2009.|$|E

40|$|The survey {{reported}} in this study focuses on assessing food productivity in Afon district area of Kwara state {{with a view to}} identify the various constraints to increased food productivity. 294 local farmers and 180 itinerant traders involved in food productivity and distribution were interviewed through questionnaire administration. Findings showed that the <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> foodstuff is due to decrease in food stuff production in the farm rather than high profit margin in the market. Similarly, evidence showed that farmers enjoyed a number of advantages from the practice of mixed cropping. Consequently, the stepwise multiple regressions identified six constraints as militating against increased production. They include <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> human labour, <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> transportation, lack of credit facilities and lack of fertilizer/high yielding seeds. Others are <b>high</b> <b>cost</b> <b>of</b> crop damages/poor storage facilities and poor sales, appropriate recommendations are duly suggested...|$|R

5|$|The war policy 1547–1549 had entailed an {{extraordinary}} expenditure of about £350,000p.a. against a regular Crown income of £150,000p.a. It {{was impossible to}} continue in this way, and Dudley quickly negotiated a withdrawal of the besieged English garrison at Boulogne. The <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> the garrison could thus be saved and French payments of redemption of roughly £180,000 were a most welcome cash income. The peace with France was concluded in the Treaty of Boulogne in March 1550. There was both public rejoicing and anger at the time, and some historians have condemned the peace as a shameful surrender of English-held territory. A year later {{it was agreed that}} King Edward was to have a French bride, the six-year-old Elisabeth of Valois. The threat of war with Scotland was also neutralised, England giving up some isolated garrisons in exchange. In the peace treaty with Scotland of June 1551, a joint commission, one of {{the first of its kind}} in history, was installed to agree upon the exact boundary between the two countries. This matter was concluded in August 1552 by French arbitration. Despite the cessation of hostilities, English defences were kept on a high level: nearly £200,000p.a. were spent on the navy and the garrisons at Calais and on the Scottish border. In his capacity as Warden-General of the Scottish Marches, Northumberland arranged for the building of a new Italianate fortress at Berwick-upon-Tweed.|$|E
5|$|There {{have been}} many {{hypotheses}} that have attempted to explain why lemurs exhibit female social dominance while other primates with similar social structures do not, but no consensus has been reached after decades of research. The dominant view in the literature states that female dominance is an advantageous trait given the <b>high</b> <b>costs</b> <b>of</b> reproduction and the scarcity of resources available. Indeed, female dominance {{has been shown to}} be linked to increased maternal investment. However, when reproductive costs and extreme seasonality of resources were compared across primates, other primates demonstrated male dominance under conditions that were similar to or more challenging than those faced by lemurs. In 2008, a new hypothesis revised this model using simple game theory. It was argued that when two individuals were equally matched in fighting capacity, the one with the most need would win the conflict since it would have the most to lose. Consequently, the female, with higher resource needs for pregnancy, lactation, and maternal care, was more likely to win in resource conflicts with equally sized males. This, however, assumed monomorphism between sexes. The following year, a new hypothesis was proposed to explain monomorphism, stating that because most female lemurs are only sexually receptive for a day or two each year, males can utilize a more passive form of mate guarding: copulatory plugs, which block the female reproductive tract, preventing other males from successfully mating with her, and thus reducing the need for aggression and the evolutionary drive for sexual dimorphism.|$|E
