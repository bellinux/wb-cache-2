5|$|In 1916, Einstein {{predicted}} gravitational waves, ripples in {{the curvature}} of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling {{outward from the}} source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings {{the concept of a}} finite speed of propagation of the physical <b>interactions</b> <b>of</b> gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the physical <b>interactions</b> <b>of</b> gravity propagate at infinite speed.|$|E

5|$|Autism has {{a strong}} genetic basis, {{although}} the genetics of autism are complex and {{it is unclear whether}} ASD is explained more by rare mutations with major effects, or by rare multigene <b>interactions</b> <b>of</b> common genetic variants. Complexity arises due to interactions among multiple genes, the environment, and epigenetic factors which do not change DNA sequencing but are heritable and influence gene expression. Many genes have been associated with autism through sequencing the genomes of affected individuals and their parents.|$|E
5|$|Climate models use {{quantitative}} methods {{to simulate the}} <b>interactions</b> <b>of</b> the atmosphere, oceans, land surface and ice.

All climate models balance, or very nearly balance, incoming energy as short wave (including visible) electromagnetic radiation to the earth with outgoing energy as long wave (infrared) electromagnetic radiation from the earth. Any imbalance results in a change in the average temperature of the earth.|$|E
5|$|Having {{electric}} charge, mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known elementary particles that engage in all four fundamental <b>interactions</b> <b>of</b> contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction. Gravitation is too weak to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E

5|$|Jupiter is perpetually {{covered with}} clouds {{composed}} of ammonia crystals and possibly ammonium hydrosulfide. The clouds {{are located in}} the tropopause and are arranged into bands of different latitudes, known as tropical regions. These are sub-divided into lighter-hued zones and darker belts. The <b>interactions</b> <b>of</b> these conflicting circulation patterns cause storms and turbulence. Wind speeds of 100m/s (360km/h) are common in zonal jets. The zones have been observed to vary in width, color and intensity from year to year, but they have remained sufficiently stable for scientists to give them identifying designations.|$|E
5|$|Modern insect-pollinated (entomophilous) {{flowers are}} conspicuously coadapted with insects to ensure {{pollination}} {{and in return}} to reward the pollinators with nectar and pollen. The two groups have coevolved for over 100 million years, creating a complex network of interactions. Either they evolved together, or at some later stages they came together, likely with pre-adaptations, and became mutually adapted. The term coevolution was coined by Paul R. Ehrlich and Peter H. Raven in 1964, to describe the evolutionary <b>interactions</b> <b>of</b> plants and butterflies.|$|E

Unlike PC, some of the other headgroups carry a net charge, which can alter the electrostatic <b>interactions</b> <b>of</b> small molecules with the bilayer.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We study a reaction-diffusion {{system with}} four morphogens {{which has been}} {{suggested}} in [23]. This system is a generalization of the Gray-Scott model [10, 11] and allows for multiple activators and multiple substrates.

We use a rigorous analysis for the linearized operator around single-spike solutions based on nonlocal eigenvalue problems and generalized hypergeometric functions. The following results are established for two activators and two substrates: Spiky solutions may be stable or unstable, {{depending on the type}} and strength <b>of</b> the <b>interaction</b> <b>of</b> the morphogens.
