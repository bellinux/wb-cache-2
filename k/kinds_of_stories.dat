25|$|Hungarian {{comic book}} artists found {{themselves}} in a very new and alien situation: while comics were having their heyday, young readers' interest drifted from Hungarian comics to the much more modern and spectacular superhero comics. Attila Fazekas, whose Star Wars adaptations were printed in 300,000 copies a decade earlier, now tries every way to remain on the surface. He produced and published his own magazine, Botond. These comic books comprised all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stories,</b> from historical to action. Every issue had a story of Botond, a character based on Hungarian legends and Asterix. He also experimented with erotic (or rather pornographic) comics – with surprisingly small success.|$|E
500|$|The {{family first}} {{appeared}} on screen on 3 June 2003. Later on in the year Indian chef Madhur Jaffrey was cast in EastEnders as Dan's estranged wife, Pushpa. Jaffrey commented, [...] "I {{really wanted to do}} the role because Indian women are usually portrayed as so proper and withdrawn – the kind of women who just stay at home cooking and cleaning. I thought, 'How wonderful of EastEnders to write a character that is realistic.' What my character has done happens all the time in India; there are all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> of people running away and marrying their lovers. This is what commonly happens in those places, but somehow the image of Indian womanhood is different." [...] Pushpa was a guest character only appearing for the duration of a storyline that revealed Dan had been lying about her death and had actually left him for another man, Pradeep (Kaleem Janjua) Dan's best friend.|$|E
500|$|The Dude {{is mostly}} {{inspired}} by Jeff Dowd, an American film producer and political activist the Coen brothers met {{while they were}} trying to find distribution for their first feature, Blood Simple. Dowd {{had been a member of}} the Seattle Seven, liked to drink White Russians, and was known as [...] "The Dude". The Dude was also partly based on a friend of the Coen brothers, Peter Exline (now a member of the faculty at USC's School of Cinematic Arts), a Vietnam War veteran who reportedly lived in a dump of an apartment and was proud of a little rug that [...] "tied the room together". Exline knew Barry Sonnenfeld from New York University and Sonnenfeld introduced Exline to the Coen brothers while {{they were trying to}} raise money for Blood Simple. Exline became friends with the Coens and in 1989, told them all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> from his own life, including ones about his actor-writer friend Lewis Abernathy (one of the inspirations for Walter), a fellow Vietnam vet who later became a private investigator and helped him track down and confront a high school kid who stole his car. As in the film, Exline's car was impounded by the Los Angeles Police Department and Abernathy found an 8th grader's homework under the passenger seat.|$|E

500|$|In January 2016, Joss Whedon {{noted that}} this process [...] "unfortunately just means the TV show gets, you know, leftovers." [...] He stated that, for example, the series' {{creative}} team initially wanted to use Loki's scepter from The Avengers but were unable due to Whedon's plans for it in Age of Ultron. On how their ability {{to connect with the}} films changed {{over the life of the}} series, Jed Whedon said, [...] "The rule when we started was we couldn't say anything about spies, we couldn't say anything about Hydra, we couldn't have any A.I. or robots or anything like that, because all of that was coming in movies that year or the year after. Since then, they've blown those doors wide open." [...] He added, [...] "We have relatively free rein we just can't go anywhere that [...] going. They know their stories so much further out than we do, which is good for us to tee up things that we know are coming to them or avoid things that they want to be special on the big screen. As long as we are not covering bases that they're going to cover, we haven't been told [...] "no" [...] that much". As an example, Whedon noted the fourth season's Framework storyline as [...] "something that's pretty significant in our world, but is also a little eddy in the river that doesn't affect anything else because it's an alternate universe. So those <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> help us go big without sending ripples through the whole MCU." ...|$|E
500|$|When {{writing the}} cases, Yamazaki would usually {{come up with}} the twist of the case first; he would think of {{something}} shocking or a surprising event, as well as the setting and set-up of the episode. He would then figure out how it could logically have happened, which he said was the most compelling method, story-wise; if it were done in the other direction – starting with how the case would work logically and then adding a twist - he found that it would not [...] "ring true". He found that coming up with ways of resolving these mysteries was very difficult compared to coming up with the set-up. He worked towards including story developments that would [...] "keep [...] guessing", and puzzles that [...] "appeal to their curiosity". He tried to create scenarios that make the player interested, which resulted in the bombing in the first episode and how the second episode's murderer appears to be a mythical creature. Among scrapped ideas for the episodes were a case of an [...] "ethereal murder" [...] where the suspect remembers killing someone but there is no body and no evidence of it even happening, and a case where a doll has been killed. He noted that these ideas, while having an impact and sounding interesting, were unrealistic and would not work. Yamazaki took inspirations from several different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stories,</b> including books, movies and television; the second episode in particular was inspired by the works of the author Natsuhiko Kyogoku.|$|E
2500|$|Different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> {{call for}} {{different}} kinds of characters, tension, pacing, themes, and dialogue. [...] A fast-paced action adventure needs fast-paced dialogue in every scene to keep the story moving forward quickly. [...] Likewise, a literary story needs the dialogue to match {{the pace of the}} other elements in the story—it needs to move more slowly. [...] Genre stories generally move quickly, employing more dialogue and action and less slow-paced narrative, because they are generally plot-driven rather than character-driven, like literary and mainstream stories. [...] The emphasis is on the action that keeps the plot moving rather than the narrative that keeps the character growing. [...] It pays to know the characters because who they are determines how slowly or quickly they talk.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} Taylor's 2005 return, her storylines changed significantly. After Ridge leaves Taylor, she becomes depressed and struggles with alcoholism. Tylo explained how this affected the character: [...] "The {{love of her life}} throws her away after she struggled so hard to come back to him. It was painful and humiliating. That made her more real and now, after everything she's been through, Taylor gets to be a little manipulative spiteful and even resentful." [...] Taylor, who is usually resilient, falls into a tailspin: accidentally killing Darla Forrester (Schae Harrison) in a hit and run accident and lying about it, later being arrested for driving under the influence. Tylo confessed, [...] "These were the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> I was begging for", as she thought [...] "it was very believable". The actress also wanted to portray Taylor as less [...] "serious".|$|E

60|$|The best haul I {{made was}} just {{seven years after}} the first one. We found out about a train that was going to bring out {{a lot of money to}} pay off the {{soldiers}} at a Government post. We stuck that train up in broad daylight. Five of us lay in the sand hills near a little station. Ten soldiers were guarding the money on the train, but they might just as well have been at home on a furlough. We didn't even allow them to stick their heads out the windows to see the fun. We had no trouble at all in getting the money, which was all in gold. Of course, a big howl was raised at the time about the robbery. It was Government stuff, and the Government got sarcastic and wanted to know what the convoy of soldiers went along for. The only excuse given was that nobody was expecting an attack among those bare sand hills in daytime. I don't know what the Government thought about the excuse, but I know that it was a good one. The surprise--that is the keynote of the train-robbing business. The papers published all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> about the loss, finally agreeing that it was between nine thousand and ten thousand dollars. The Government sawed wood. Here are the correct figures, printed for the first time--forty-eight thousand dollars. If anybody will take the trouble to look over Uncle Sam's private accounts for that little debit to profit and loss, he will find that I am right to a cent.|$|E
60|$|I {{read the}} other day {{something}} that I thought would interest so great a sea-bather as yourself. You know that the fishes that we see, and catch, go only a certain way down into the sea. Below a certain depth there is no life at all. The water is as empty as the air is above a certain height. Even the shells of dead fishes that come down there are crushed into nothing by the huge weight of the water. Lower still, in {{the places where the}} sea is profoundly deep, it appears that life begins again. People fish up in dredging-buckets loose rags and tatters of creatures that hang together all right down there with the great weight holding them in one, but come all to pieces as they are hauled up. Just what they look like, just what they do or feed upon, we shall never find out. Only that we have some flimsy fellow-creatures down in the very bottom of the deep seas, and cannot get them up except in tatters. It must be pretty dark where they live, and there are no plants or weeds, and no fish come down there, or drowned sailors either, from the upper parts, because these are all mashed to pieces by the great weight long before they get so far, or else come to a place where perhaps they float. But I dare say a cannon sometimes comes careering solemnly down, and circling about like a dead leaf or thistle-down; and then the ragged fellows go and play about the cannon and tell themselves all <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> about the fish higher up and their iron houses, and perhaps go inside and sleep, and perhaps dream of it all like their betters.|$|E
6000|$|There are two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>stories</b> {{which the}} {{scientists}} say cannot be true, because everybody tells them. The first class {{consists of the}} stories which are told everywhere, because they are somewhat odd or clever; {{there is nothing in}} the world to prevent their having happened to somebody as an adventure any more than there is anything to prevent their having occurred, as they certainly did occur, to somebody as an idea. But they are not likely to have happened to many people. The second class of their [...] "myths" [...] consist of the stories that are told everywhere for the simple reason that they happen everywhere. Of the first class, for instance, we might take such an example as the story of William Tell, now generally ranked among legends upon the sole ground that it is found in the tales of other peoples. Now, it is obvious that this was told everywhere because whether true or fictitious it is what is called [...] "a good story;" [...] it is odd, exciting, and it has a climax. But to suggest that some such eccentric incident can never have happened in the whole history of archery, or that it did not happen to any particular person of whom it is told, is stark impudence. The idea of shooting at a mark attached to some valuable or beloved person is an idea doubtless that might easily have occurred to any inventive poet. But it is also an idea that might easily occur to any boastful archer. It might be one of the fantastic caprices of some story-teller. It might equally well be one of the fantastic caprices of some tyrant. It might occur first in real life and afterwards occur in legends. Or it might just as well occur first in legends and afterwards occur in real life. If no apple has ever been shot off a boy's head from the beginning of the world, it may be done tomorrow morning, and by somebody who has never heard of William Tell.|$|E
