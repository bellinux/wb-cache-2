40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the performance of a}} booster seat in different seating configurations in side-impact hyGe sled tests (crash severity 30 km/h) with two attachment systems: a standard seatbelt and ISOfix (rigid). The objectives of the study were twofold: (i) to identify the relative benefits of <b>ISOfix</b> <b>attachment</b> compared with seatbelt attachment of a near-side booster seat in a 3 -abreast seating configuration with adjacent occupants in child restraints (CRS); and (ii) {{to examine the effects of}} 3 -abreast seating configurations compared with no adjacent passengers on booster seat crash protection characteristics. Overall, the findings confirmed the superior performance of the rigid anchorages in reducing lateral motion of the booster as well as the two adjacent CRS. However, the expected benefits of the rigid attachment in reducing head accelerations were not uniformly observed across the three occupants/seating positions and also appeared to be influenced by seating configuration (3 -abreast versus no adjacent occupant). Further research is warranted to explore the applicability of the findings for different CRS types and seating configurations...|$|E
40|$|Paper Number 05 - 0425 The aim of {{this study}} was to examine the {{relative}} effectiveness of two booster seats for use by children across a wide age span, from around 3 years to 10 + years. The study was part of a broad research program to identify suitable child restraint systems (CRS) to fit a large sedan vehicle to maximise protection in a crash. Dummies were restrained in the rear seat of a vehicle buck in three restraint configurations with boosters: (i) with a standard adult lap-sash seatbelt, (ii) with a seatbelt plus H-harness and crotch strap, or (iii) with a seatbelt plus H-harness with the crotch strap disengaged (to simulate the effects of real-world misuse conditions), and a fourth condition (iv) with an adult seatbelt only. Boosters were fitted in the vehicle with two different anchorage systems: a standard seatbelt and a system including a retrofitted rigid <b>ISOFIX</b> <b>attachment</b> and top tether. HyGe sled tests were conducted to simulate a 64 km/h offset deformable barrier frontal impact with a change in velocity of around 71 km/h. Preliminary investigations were also conducted using side impact simulations with a change in velocity of around 15 km/h. Overall, the booster seats for both the 6 year old dummy and the 3 year old dummy when a (with harness and crotch strap) provided superior crash protection than use of the adult seatbelt. For tests when the H-harness was used to restrain the dummy, use of the crotch strap was critical in eliminating ‘sub-marining’. The research highlighted the potential for serious injury with misuse of child harness systems and identified several areas for design improvement of booster seats...|$|E

5000|$|In the EU {{the system}} is known as ISOFIX and covers both Group 0/0+ and Group 1 child safety seats.

However, some child seat manufacturers are beginning to offer true <b>ISOFIX</b> type <b>attachments</b> in the U.S. In the European standard, there are also various installation categories: [...] "universal", [...] "vehicle-specific" [...] and [...] "semi-universal". The main difference is that [...] "Universal" [...] represents use of a top tether strap with the ISOFIX anchorage, [...] "vehicle-specific" [...] represents the usage of the ISOFIX anchorage without the top tether in specified vehicles only, while [...] "Semi-Universal" [...] represents usage of the ISOFIX anchorage together with a [...] "foot-prop".|$|R

Buses are one of the safest forms of transportation. Nonetheless, bus crashes resulting in occupant injuries and fatalities do occur. Each year, more than 5, 800 children die, nearly 120, 000 are permanently disabled, and more than 14 million are hurt seriously enough to require emergency medical care due to unintentional injury. Therefore, effort is needed to improve the performance of bus interior and structure. Child Safety is a continuing effort to improve the safety of children in mass transit buses. This project provides an overview of the implementation of two types of attachment systems Child Restraint Systems (CRS) in a mass transit buses. A series of sled tests were conducted in order to evaluate the performance of the Child Restraint Systems for typical frontal, side and rear crash scenarios. The results of the test indicate that the implementation of <b>ISOFIX</b> or LATCH <b>attachments</b> in transit bus seats mitigates the risk of severe injuries to the 12 month-old, and 3 year-old occupants; while not increasing the risk of severe injuries due to CRS interactions to other unrestraint adult passengers. In the next phase of this research, results from these sled tests were validated using the multibody analysis tool MADYMO to evaluate the performance of child safety in mass transit buses using the Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS 208) injury criteria. The Kinematics of sled tests are closely matching with that of simulations. Injury values for sled tests and simulations are well below injury criteria. The results from this study show the 20 % variation in injury signals. This study concludes that interior for mass transit bus with child seats and restraint can be utilized in mass transit buses to improve the safety performance of children...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{evaluates the}} performance of automotive child restraint systems (CRS) that conform to international proposals for a universal restraint concept to be adopted by both restraint and vehicle manufacturers. The concept is known as Isofix (International Standards Organisation FIXing), and is intended to ensure optimum compatibility and coupling between vehicle and CRS. In order to quantify {{the benefits of the}} proposed Isofix concept it has been necessary to establish the performance limits and benefits offered by current commercially available adult belt retained CRS. A considerable body of knowledge existed on the performance and limitations of the then current CRS. However, during 1995 a significant amendment was introduced affecting ECE R 44, the compliance standards applicable to CRS in Europe to which most rnanufacturers require their products to conform (separate national standards also exist). In 1995 amendment 03 was added to ECE R 44 and became a catalyst for considerable development activity by manufacturers of child restraints, that resulted in new or revised product ranges. These new products, in particular forward facing Group 1 (9 - 15 kg) child restraints have significantly improved dynamic performance in frontal impacts, notably in modern vehicles whose seat belt anchorage positions have been optimised for restraint of adults, but are commonly less effective in restraining framed CRS. It was important therefore to re-assess existing systems as the baseline for a realistic evaluation of the proposed Isofix concepts (chapter 10). It was evident that, of the different Isofix concepts being proposed, no overall evaluation of their relative performance had, to that date, been undertaken. A programme involving the design and manufacture of not only suitable test equipment but, in a number of cases, prototype devices, was undertaken. The resulting data have formed the basis of input to the ISO Working Group 1, the body responsible for the evolution of the Isofix concept. This programme also highlighted a number of shortfalls in the proposed concepts. The major results of this test programme have been published at international level, and were used to inform the Isofix discussions. During the programme of comparative evaluation of not only the Isofix but the current belt retained devices, it became clear to the writer that in a frontal impact the orientation of the occupant with respect to the direction of travel had significance. A literature survey produced evidence of minimal research in this area. Hence it was decided by the writer to include a programme of parametric tests to investigate the significance of occupant orientation, given that commercially available CRS often include a feature to vary the recline angle of the seat. The Isofix set-up was particularly suitable for this exercise in that it eliminated many of the variables associated with belt retained devices. The results of this work have been published at intemationallevel. A review of the available accident data indicates that side impacts are potentially more life threatening than the more common frontal impacts due to the proximity of the occupant to an intruding vehicle or object. However, current European certification standards do not require the evaluation of CRS in a side impact. This is considered to be an area where improvements, particularly aided by an <b>Isofix</b> type <b>attachment</b> concept, can be made. Therefore the final area of research undertaken by the writer was to develop and propose a test to evaluate CRS in a realistic side impact scenario. This involved the simulation of not only the acceleration imparted to the target vehicle occupant but in addition the intrusion component. This work, which again has been presented at international level, contributed towards a proposal to amend the European certification standard for CRS to include a side impact evaluation. This thesis commences with a review of the accident data currently available, and looks at how the physiological and anatomical properties of the child, vehicle design, and the inherent potential for misuse and mis-installation of the current generation of CRS, impact upon child safety. This is followed by an overview of the lsofix proposal before the results of the writer's detailed testing of both current belt retained and proposed Isofix CRS concepts (chapters 10 and 11) are reported. The subsequent chapters (12 and 13) detail the results of the writer's investigation into CRS orientation in a frontal impact {{and the development of a}} representative side impact test, based on a single sled, for inclusion in the European certification procedure. The document concludes with discussion and conclusions relating to the future of CRS design and evaluation. The major findings of this research were: • contrary to initial expectations, significant CRS recline angle in a forward facing device has been proven to be undesirable; • Isofix CRS with rigid lower anchors have been shown to be beneficial, particularly in side impacts, their efficacy in a forward impact being compromised by rotation in devices that do not incorporate an anti-rotation device; • a side impact test has been developed which more accurately represents the input to a CRS seen in a rear vehicle incident. Such a test is not only desirable but essential to drive CRS manufacturers into improving side impact protection for occupants...|$|R
