50|$|From the {{chemistry}} perspective, nitroimidazole antibiotics {{can be classified}} according {{to the location of}} the nitro functional group. 4- and 5-nitroimidazole are equivalent from the perspective of drugs since these tautomers readily interconvert. Drugs of the 5-nitro variety include metronidazole, tinidazole, nimorazole, <b>dimetridazole,</b> 6-Amino PA824, ornidazole, megazol, and azanidazole. Drugs based on 2-nitromidazoles include benznidazole. Nitroimidazole antibiotics have been used to combat anaerobic bacterial and parasitic infections. Perhaps the most common example is metronidazole. Other heterocycles such as nitrothiazoles (thiazole) are also used for this purpose. Nitroheterocycles may be reductively activated in hypoxic cells, and then undergo redox recycling or decompose to toxic products.|$|E

40|$|In {{the current}} report, a {{sequential}} step-wise methodology based on in silico, in vitro and in vivo experimental {{procedures for the}} prompt detection of potential trichomonacidal drugs is proposed. A combinatorial of 12 QSAR (Quantitative Structure-Activity Relationship) models based on Linear Discrimination Analysis (LDA) are suggested for the rational identification of new trichomonacidal drugs from virtual screening of in house chemical libraries and drug databases. Subsequently, compounds selected as potential anti-trichomonas are screened in vitro against Trichomonas vaginalis. Finally, molecules with specific trichomonacidal activity are evaluated in vivo. Herein, different molecules {{were exposed to the}} proposed methodology. Firstly, the agents were virtually screened and two of the eight molecules (G- 1 and <b>dimetridazole)</b> were classified as trichomonacidals by the 12 models. Subsequently both drugs were proved in vitro and in vivo following the workflow procedure. Although a remarkable in vitro activity was observed in both cases, <b>dimetridazole</b> achieved higher MIC 100 activity than metronidazole against the resistant isolate. Furthermore, the in vivo models showed a remarkable reduction of lesions of more than 55 % in both compounds.

The highest infection was recorded in angelfish (90 %) followed by oscar (75. 4 %) and bluembuna (61 %), respectively. Identification of diplomonad flagellates from angelfish by means of morphological studies underlight and electron microscopes indicated that the parasite was Spironucleus vortens. The 14 –days LD 50 of S. vortens inangelfish was 2. 99 x 103 cells. Histopathological changes of infected angelfish revealed granulomatous liver, numerousnumbers of melanomacrophage in the spleen and inflammation of the intestine. Susceptibility study of S. vortens to goldfish(Carassius auratus), guppy (Poecilia reticulata) and platy (Xiphophorus maculatus) indicated that they were resistant toartificial infection.

40|$|International audienceTwo {{different}} {{electrochemical reduction}} processes {{for the removal}} of <b>dimetridazole,</b> a nitroimidazole-based antibiotic, were examined in this work. A direct electrochemical reduction was first carried out in a home-made flow cell in acidic medium at potentials chosen to minimize the formation of amino derivatives and then the formation of azo dimer. Analysis of the electrolyzed solution showed a total degradation of <b>dimetridazole</b> and the BOD 5 /COD ratio increased from 0. 13 to 0. 24. An indirect electrochemical reduction in the presence of titanocene dichloride ((C 5 H 5) 2 TiCl 2), which is used to reduce selectively nitro compounds, was then investigated to favour the formation of amino compounds over hydroxylamines and then to prevent the formation of azo and azoxy dimers. UPLC-MS/MS analyses showed a higher selectivity towards the formation of the amino compound for indirect electrolyses performed at pH 2. To confirm the effectiveness of the electrochemical reduction, a biological treatment involving activated sludge was then carried out after direct and indirect electrolyses at different pH.

The analytes were analyzed by HPLC equipped with diode array detector. In the optimized process, several parameters, including the composition of desorption solvent, pH value and ionic strength in sample matrix, extraction, and desorption time, were investigated in detail.

40|$|Monolayer {{cultures}} of pig hepatocytes {{were used to}} investigate {{the role of the}} liver in the biotransformation of the veterinary drug <b>dimetridazole</b> (1, 2 -dimethyl- 5 -nitroimidazole). 14 C-Labeled <b>dimetridazole</b> (DMZ) was primarily hydroxylated to 1 -methyl- 2 -hydroxymethyl- 5 -nitroimidazole (up to 90 %) and to a minor extent N-demethylated to 2 -methyl-(4, 5) -nitroimidazole (6 - 10 %). Prolonged incubation with the parent drug but also the 2 -hydroxymethyl metabolite resulted in the formation of two other minor metabolites. The major one of these was identified as the glucuronide of the 2 -hydroxymethyl metabolite, based on its molecular mass and the succesful hydrolysis with β-glucuronidase. The second showed a molecular mass of 144 and is hypothesized to be 2 -hydroxymethyl- 5 -nitroimidazole. No evidence was obtained for the formation of a cysteine or glutathione conjugate involved in the detoxification of reactive intermediates. In addition to free metabolites, there was a time-related formation of protein-bound metabolites up to a maximum of 30 pmol/mg of protein after exposure to 50 μM DMZ for 48 h. In general, these metabolites accounted for 0. 06 - 0. 15 % of the metabolized DMZ. Unextractable metabolites were also observed after incubation of cells with the 2 -hydroxymethyl and 1 -desmethyl metabolites. It is concluded that the 1 -desmethyl and, in particular, the 2 -hydroxymethyl metabolite are the major metabolites formed by pig hepatocytes. These compounds are thus far the only metabolites identified in vivo, but together with the parent compound, they accounted for only a small part (< 5 %) of the excreted drug.

The growth of 90 % of isolates was inhibited by <b>dimetridazole</b> at a concentration of 4 μg/mL, and by tiamulin at 8 μg/mL Australian isolates resistant to both antimicrobial agents were identified. Lincomycin was less effective than these antimicrobial agents, with 90 % of isolates requiring a concentration of 128 μg/mL for inhibition of growth, and 54 % being susceptible at 64 μg/mL. Tylosin did not prevent the growth of the majority of S hyodysenteriae isolates tested, and 90 % were resistant to concentrations of 128 μg/mL. Resistant isolates came from different geographical areas.

In both cases, under strict anaerobic conditions DMZ was metabolized without major ring cleavage or nitrate formation. However, one of two distinct metabolic pathways is involved, depending on the susceptibility of the strain. In the susceptible strain, the classical reduction pathway of nitroaromatic compounds is followed {{at least as far as}} the nitroso-radical anion, with further formation of the azo-dimer: 5, 5 '-azobis-(1, 2 -dimethylimidazole). In the resistant strain, DMZ is reduced to the amine derivative, namely, 5 -amino- 1, 2 -dimethylimidazole, preventing the formation of the toxic form of the drug. The specificity of the six-electron reduction of the nitro group, which is restricted to 4 - and 5 -nitroimidazole, suggests an enzymatic reaction. We thus conclude that nimA and related genes may encode a 5 -nitroimidazole reductase...|$|E
40|$|A {{confirmatory method}} has been {{developed}} {{to allow for the}} analysis of fourteen prohibited medicinal additives in pig and poultry compound feed. These compounds are prohibited for use as feed additives although some are still authorised for use in medicated feed. Feed samples are extracted by acetonitrile with addition of sodium sulphate. The extracts undergo a hexane wash to aid with sample purification. The extracts are then evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in initial mobile phase. The samples undergo an ultracentrifugation step prior to injection onto the LC-MS/MS system and are analysed in a run time of 26 minutes. The LC-MS/MS system is run in MRM mode with both positive and negative electrospray ionisation.

Benzo(a) pyrene, the food pyrolysate 2 -amino- 1 -methyl- 6 - phenylimidazo [4, 5]pyridine or PhIP and 2 - aminoanthracene were used as mutagens in most experiments. These agents exert mutagenic activity only in the presence of mamalian metabolic activation. In all experiments the mutagenic activity of the three chemicals could be abolished by the presence of 2 mg of chlorophyllin or 0, 5 mg of hematin per selection plate. Considering the results of experiments in which chlorophyllin and hematin were added at several different times after the addition of the metabolic activation system it was concluded that the formed mutagenic metabolites were trapped and inactivated by these porfyrines. The antimutagenic activities of these porfyrines decreased when the porfyrine ring was destroyed as appeared from experiments with biliverdin and bilirubin. Due to its low solubility the antimutagenic activity of chlorophyll is not or nearly not demonstrable.

Of particular concern is the aquatic contamination {{caused by the}} increasing use of antibiotics, which could give rise to superbugs. While researchers have mainly focused on improving the adsorption capacity of mostly activated carbon-based adsorbents, we have developed a non-conventional adsorbent (SiC nanoparticles) in the present work for the adsorptive removal of four different nitroimidazole antibiotics, namely metronidazole (MNZ), <b>dimetridazole</b> (DMZ), ronidazole (RNZ), and tinidazole (TNZ). In addition to the unique properties which are inherent to SiC, the present adsorbent not only possesses a high adsorption capacity, but also shows one of the highest adsorption rates; both of which are prerequisites for an efficient and cost-effective adsorption-based separation technology. Silicon carbide (SiC) nanoparticles, synthesized by a microwave-assisted method, were thoroughly characterized using X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, and the Brunauer–Emmett–Teller method. The adsorption isotherm data were accurately described by the Langmuir isotherm model. On the other hand, the adsorption kinetics, closely represented by the pseudo-second order kinetic model, were faster than most previously reported adsorbents.

Thedisease in CR pigs was characterized by a severe mucohemorrhagic enteritis; in contrast, a mild catarrhal enteritis was observed in specific pathogen-free and gnotobiotic pigs. Spirochaetes and vibrio-like organisms were observed only in CR pigs and increased during the clinical phase of the disease. The clinical syndrome was not transmitted by oral administration of intestinal or fecal material from infected CR pigs to CR pigs free of T. suis. Smaller numbers of T. suis produced diarrhea in CR pigs and significantly reduced the growth rates of infected animals; clinical signs and the reduction in growth rate was prevented by incorporating an antibacterial substance (<b>dimetridazole)</b> in the food. Although clinical trichuriasis closely resembles swin dysentery, the two syndromes seem to be distinct. The present results suggest that a microbial component acts synergistically with T. suis to produce the severe clinical syndrome in CR pigs, but identification of {{the microbial}} component and the mechanism by which clinical signs are produced await further studies of the bacterial flora of the large intestine of pigs...|$|E

In addition, the resistance profiles of these isolates against five different nitro-imidazoles (metronidazole, <b>dimetridazole,</b> ronidazole, tinidazole and carnidazole) were determined. Two different Trichomonas sequence types were isolated. Sequence type A isolates were recovered from racing and wild pigeons, in contrast to sequence type B which was only isolated from wild pigeons. Isolates with sequence type B were all susceptible to the tested nitro-imidazoles, except for tinidazole-resistance in 3 isolates. Resistance to the nitro-imidazoles was observed more frequently in isolates obtained from racing pigeons than from wild pigeons, with most isolates belonging to sequence type A. A higher percentage of the sequence type A isolated from racing pigeons, in comparison with those isolated from the wild pigeons, were resistant to the nitro-imidazoles and displayed higher mean lethal concentration (MLC) values. Two isolates belonging to sequence type A, 1 recovered from a racing pigeon and 1 from a wild pigeon, displayed a similar resistance pattern, suggesting a potential exchange of resistant isolates between racing pigeons and wild pigeons...|$|E
40|$|The ocurrence {{and levels}} of PhACs, Endocrine Disrupting and related Compounds (EDCs) in seafood from {{potential}} contaminated areas in Europe has been studied. Macroalgae (S. accharina latissima and Laminaria digitata), bivalves (Mytilus galloprovincialis, Mytilus spp., Chamalea gallina and Crassostrea gigas) and fish (Liza aurata and Platichthys flesus) from Portugal, Spain, Italy, Netherlands, and Norway were analysed following 4 different analytical protocols depending on the organism and target group of contaminants. The results revealed the presence of 4 pharmaceutical compounds in macroalgae samples, 16 in bivalves and 10 in fish. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that PhACs have been detected in marine fish and in macroalgae. Besides, this is also the first time that <b>dimetridazole,</b> hydrochlorothiazide and tamsulosin have been detected in biota samples. The highest levels of PhACs corresponded to the psychiatric drug velanfaxine (up to 36. 1 ng/g dry weight (dw)) and the antibiotic azithromycin (up to 13. 3 ng/g dw) in bivalves from the Po delta (Italy). EDCs were not detected in macroalgae samples, however, the analysis revealed the presence of 10 EDCs in bivalves and 8 in fish. The highest levels corresponded to the organophosphorus flame retardant tris(2 -butoxyethyl) phosphate (TBEP) reaching up to 98. 4 ng/g dw in mullet fish from the Tagus estuary. Bivalves, in particular mussels, have shown to be good bioindicator organisms for PhACs and fish for EDCs. Taking into consideration the concentrations and frequencies of detection of PhACs and EDCs in the seafood samples analysed, a list of candidates' compounds for priorization in future studies has been proposed. </p...|$|E
40|$|One of the {{diseases}} that cause great {{damage in the}} pig breeding farms, Brachyspyra swine dysentery has a special importance because involve great losses both by growth failure and high mortality andsignificant costs to the prevention and control. The {{study was conducted in}} a swine farm in Timis County, where the disease was originally identified in autumn of year 2009. Cumulative adverse conditions have affected the rate of morbidity and mortality. Themost common clinical developments in the unit were usually acute and subacute. Research included: a comparative study of the effectiveness of tiamulin fumarate, hydrogenated and <b>dimetridazole</b> powder in sick acute and subacute forms in piglets, at the weaning period; the comparative study of efficiency in therapy of soluble tiamulin (the tiamulin fumarate-hydrogenated) and of the injection of piglets effective and the study of growth indicators: average daily gain. Experiment IGroup I consisted in 15 piglets with an average weight per lot of 7. 60 kg/head (batch weight: 114 kg) received p. o. <b>dimetridazole</b> insoluble powder (Romvac Bucharest), mixed in feed, for 5 days dose of 25 mg/kg. bw. During the observation, two mortalities were recorded, representing 13. 33 % of the treated lot. Other animals from the group were clinically cured, the signs of the disease gradually disappeared, and the temperature returned to normal enteric symptoms. The observation period after the 21 days of experiment, the batchweight was 114. 2 kg, corresponding to growth registered 95. 5 g/head/day. Group II, of 15 pigs with enteritis clinical signs, have had an average weight per lot of 7. 48 kg/head, and he has undergone treatment with tiamulin product (Novartis Animal Health) soluble granules, in drinking water. Treatments were performed for 5 consecutive days at a dose of 60 mg/liter of drinking water. In this group, diarrhea symptoms decreased and general status of the animals gradually improved, no mortality was recorded five days after the treatment, no longer signs of illness being observed, all animals became normothermic. Weight gain recorded on our observation period was 29. 3 kg/ lot which correspond to average daily gain of 162. 7 g/day/animal. Group III, considered as control group, was {{at the beginning of the}} observation period, established with the average weight per lot, of 7. 88 kg/head. In this series evolved enteritis with clear clinical manifestations (acute and subacute forms) and during the experiment did not receive any treatment. Within this lot, in the studied period have died five piglets which represent 33. 33 % of the group. Consequently, to avoid the unnecessary losses, in the 21 day of experiment, the 10 remaining piglets were orally treated with tiamulin (60 mg/litre drinking water). Subsequent observations have shown gradual improvement and clinical remission to the remaining piglets. In the control group, practically can’t talk about a weight gain. After the 21 day average daily gain for animals remaining batch was 45. 1 g/day/animal. Experiment IIThe groups were selected from age group 35 - 45 days, which are each, composed of 12 heads per group. Group I was treated with soluble granules tiamulin concentration of 45 mg of active substance per litre of drinking water. Treatment was performed over a period of 5 days. During the experiment, within this group there was one death case representing 8. 33 %. The remaining 12 piglets were cured within two weeks. Initial weight was of 92. 9 kg/ group, and after 21 days of experiment, it reached at 98. 9 kg, corresponding to an average daily gain of 101. 5 g/head/day. Although, there was loss of a pig, average daily gain of piglets remaining was considered positive, the group recorded an increase of 6 kg in the 21 days of study. Group II received in drinking water, soluble tiamulin at concentration of 60 mg / litre for 5 consecutive days. In this group there was no mortality, all 12 piglets to heal within 10 days (cure rate 100 %). The final weight for this group was of 117. 6 kg (a plus of 24. 9 kg), the recorded growth being of 172. 8 g/head/day. Group III was treated the injectable product Tiamutin 200 (1 ml/ 20 kg. bw. intramuscularly for 4 days. Registered losses were 2 pigs, the remaining 10 piglets healing within 10 to 14 days. If this group, because of the recorded mortality (average daily gain 79. 1 g/head/day), have not economic efficiency. Group IV - control has not received any treatment within 7 days of the experiment. During this time four piglets died (all with forms of hemorrhagic enteritis) and accounted for a proportion of 33. 3 % of the lot. After those seven days, in the aim to reduce the unnecessary losses, the remaining piglets were treated with tiamulin soluble dose to 90 mg/l for 5 consecutive days. Note that all the remaining 8 animals treated were cured. The economic indicators showed clearly the weight declining. At the end of the experiment, there was a loss of 26 kg and four dead piglets. In conclusion, the comparative use in therapy of tiamulin and <b>dimetridazole,</b> preparations having effect inswine's dysentery, have shown that, both have certain therapeutic effects, but tiamulin far proved to be most effective. The results come to confirm other studies showing superior efficacy of tiamulins as preventive and curative choice in swine dysentery with Brachyspira hyodysenteriae...|$|E
40|$|A liquid {{chromatography}} - electrospray ionisation - tamdem mass spectrometry method for the simultaneous detection and quantitation of 5 -notroimidazole veterinary drugs in lyophilised pork meat, the chosen format {{of a candidate}} certified reference material, has been developed and validated. Six analytes {{have been included in}} the scope of validation, i. e. <b>dimetridazole,</b> DMZ, metronidazole, MNZ, ronidazole, RNZ, hydroxy metronidazole, MNZOH, hydroxy ipronidazole, IPZOH, and 2 -hydroxymethyl- 1 -methyl- 5 -nitroimidazole, HMMNI. The analytes were extracted from the sample with ethyl acetate, chromatographically separated on a C 18 column, and finally identified and quantified by tandem mass spectrometry in the multiple reaction monitoring (MRM) using matrix-matched calibration and d 3 -labelled analogues of the analytes (except for MNZOH, where d 3 -MNZ was used). The method was validated in accordance with Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC, by determining selectivity, linearity, matrix effect, apparent recovery, repeatability and intermediate precision, decision limits and detection capabilities, robustness of sample preparation method, and stability of extracts. Recovery at 1 ug/kg level was at 100 % (estimates in the range of 101 - 107 %) for all analytes, repeatabilities and intermedicate precisions at this level were in the range of 4 - 12 % and 2 - 9 %, respectively. Linearity of calibration curves in the working range 0. 5 - 10 ug/kg was confirmed, with r values typically > 0. 99. Decision limits (CCa) and the detection capabilities (CCß) according to ISO 11843 - 2 (calibration curve approach) were 0. 29 - 0. 44 and 0. 36 - 0. 54 ug/kg, respectively. The method reliably identifies and quantifies the selected nitroimidazoles in the reconstituted pork meat in the low and sub ug/kg range and will be applied in an interlaboratory comparison for determining the mass fraction of the selected nitroimidazoles in the candidate reference material currently developed at IRMM.

30|$|Monoclonal {{antibody}} (mAb) has higher specificity {{and better}} repeatability than polyclonal antibody. Therefore, {{it is more}} suitable for the detection of the substance of a particular structure. By virtue of benefits drawn from their specific, sensitive, rapid, simple, and high-throughput characters, mAbs can be widely used in practical testing. Despite being useful, it also has some disadvantages. The approaches for preparing antibodies are mostly empirical and guided by nonstandardized protocols and individual experience [46]. During the experiment, great care has to be exercised to dilution factors and cultivation conditions {{such as the use of}} feeder cells [47]. Moreover, screening for single hybridoma cell clones that produce high-quality antibody is mainly done by ELISA. When using this method to isolate target cells, a large number of cells would be lost. This makes the whole process extremely time consuming and labor intensive [48]. Furthermore, the characteristic of antibody is vulnerable to be impacted by the feature of antigen. For example, the extent and yield of the antigen against protein’s chemical conjugation may be very important to mAb. Acevedo et al. [49] proved that combining double-chemically modified carrier proteins with hetero-functional crosslinkers allows preparing tailor-made hapten protein carrier conjugates. Wang et al. [50] prepared a generic mAb and developed a sensitive ic-ELISA for detecting phenothiazines in animal feed. The limit of detections of the method ranged from 1.1 to 15.3  μg/kg. Han et al. [51] produced an mAb with broad specificity to nitroimidazoles, <b>dimetridazole,</b> ipronidazole, ronidazole hydroxydimetridazole, and hydroxyipronidazole, with the IC 50 values of 4.79, 0.47, 5.97, 23.48, and 15.03  μg/L, respectively. Peng et al. [52] used arsanilic acid as a hapten, and produced the suitable mAb for simultaneously determining organoarsenic compounds including nitarsone, carbarsone, and arsanilic acid in animal tissue and feed.|$|E
40|$|A {{confirmatory method}} has been {{developed}} {{to allow for the}} analysis of eleven nitroimidazoles and also chloramphenicol in milk and honey samples. These compounds are classified as A 6 compounds in annex IV of council regulation 2377 / 90 and therefore prohibited for the use in animal husbandry. Milk samples are extracted by acetonitrile with addition of NaCl, while honey samples are first dissolved in water before a similar extraction. Honey extracts undergo a hexane wash to remove impurities. Both milk and honey extracts are evaporated to dryness and reconstituted in initial mobile phase. These are then injected onto an LC-MS/MS system and analysed in less than 9 minutes. The MS/MS is operated in MRM mode with positive and negative electrospray ionisation. The method is validated in accordance with Commission Decision 2002 / 657 /EC and is capable of analysing for metronidazole, <b>dimetridazole,</b> ronidazole, ipronidazole and there hydroxy metabolites MNZ-OH, HMMNI and IPZ-OH. The method is also able to analyse for carnidazole, ornidazole, ternidazole, tinidazole and chloramphenicol. A level of 3 μg L- 1 / μg kg- 1 (RL) for MNZ, DMZ and RNZ has been recommended by the community reference laboratory responsible for this substance group and this method can easily detect all nitroimidazoles at this level. A minimum required performance level of 0. 3 μg L- 1 / μg kg- 1 is in place for chloramphenicol which the method can also easily detect.
