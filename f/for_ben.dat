5|$|He {{retained}} {{his place}} in the Under-18 team for 2007–08, in addition to making his debut for the reserve team against Wigan Athletic on 7 November 2007, and during the season he impressed enough to be selected to go on the first-team's 2008 summer tour of South Africa. Amos was named as a substitute for all three matches of the tour, but did not play. En route back from South Africa, United stopped off in Nigeria to play against Portsmouth on 27 July 2008, with Amos replacing Tomasz Kuszczak after 76 minutes.

5|$|Lucius Belyakov is {{a mysterious}} man who appears in Ben's and Brother Justin's dreams as a Russian soldier. He is also {{revealed}} to be the previous generation's Creature of Light. Unknown at first, {{he is also the}} carnival's Management, hiding in his trailer and communicating with his carny workers solely through Samson. He is also the father of Iris and Justin Crowe. As Management remains unseen during the first season, it is unclear at first whether Management exists at all. Late in the season however, Management is shown to have a conversation with Lodz. In the second season, Management reveals himself to Ben as Lucius Belyakov, the soldier of his dreams who was once badly injured by a bear. Management wants Ben to break an unfolding chain of catastrophic events, which will lead to the death of millions. Management urges Ben to find and bring Scudder to him, as he will know the identity of the current generation's Avatar of Darkness. After Ben accomplishes his mission, Management attacks Scudder and is stabbed by Ben to protect the latter. Ben reveals to Samson that Management had planned <b>for</b> <b>Ben</b> to kill him so all of his powers would pass to Ben. With his last breath, Management tells Ben how to defeat the Usher, Ben's ultimate nemesis.|$|E

25|$|Helen Cooper of Cambridge University {{writes that}} because Guy Earl of Warwick {{would be a}} work of extreme juvenilia <b>for</b> <b>Ben</b> Jonson, and also {{possibly}} a revision of a still older play, Jonson's involvement cannot be discounted. Cooper notes that in Jonson's 1632 play The Magnetic Lady, Jonson describes his ideally bad play in terms that correspond well to the plot of Guy Earl of Warwick, and suggests the possibility that Jonson was, in fact, criticizing his own primitive work.|$|E
25|$|Restieaux then traded as agent <b>for</b> <b>Ben</b> Pease on Ponape atoll, {{although}} that venture failed. In August 1871 Restieaux sailed with Bully Hayes on the Leonora {{and landed on}} Pingelap atoll where he traded as agent for Hayes until May 1872. Bully Hayes gave Restieaux a promissory note payable three months from date – this was never paid. Restieaux sailed with Hayes through the Gilbert Islands (now known as Kiribati) and arrived in Samoa in December 1872. He met Louis Beck, who travelled with Hayes on the Leonora; Beck's later published stories helped to build the mythic history of Bully Hayes.|$|E

25|$|However, in late February, Kane {{suffered}} {{a shoulder injury}} that was expected to sideline him {{for the remainder of}} the regular season and much of the playoffs. The team called up rookie Teuvo Teravainen from the American Hockey League, and traded their first-round pick in the 2015 NHL Entry Draft to acquire center Antoine Vermette from the Arizona Coyotes. The Blackhawks also acquired veteran defenseman Kimmo Timonen from the Philadelphia Flyers for second round picks in 2015 and 2016, and Andrew Desjardins from the San Jose Sharks in exchange <b>for</b> <b>Ben</b> Smith. The Blackhawks finished the season with a 48–28–6 record, placing third in their division. The team allowed the fewest goals in the NHL.|$|E
25|$|Returning to Britain in 1910, Mann wrote The Way to Win, a {{pamphlet}} that argued that socialism {{could be achieved}} only through trade unionism and co-operation, and that parliamentary democracy was inherently corrupt. He founded the Industrial Syndicalist Education League, and worked as an organiser <b>for</b> <b>Ben</b> Tillett. He led the 1911 Liverpool General Transport Strike. In 1912 he was convicted under the Incitement to Mutiny Act 1797 of publishing an article in The Syndicalist, as an 'Open Letter to British Soldiers', urging them to refuse to shoot at strikers (later reprinted as a leaflet, Don't Shoot); his prison sentence was quashed after public pressure. He was opposed to Britain's involvement in World War I on socialist and religious grounds and addressed pacifist rallies.|$|E

25|$|History was {{repeated}} on 4 October 2015 when {{for only the}} second time in the NRL's history, no NSW team was in the grand final and for the first time ever, it was a Queensland derby in the final between Brisbane and North Queensland. 82,758 people, many of whom had travelled down from various parts of Queensland, witnessed one of the all-time great grand finals when the game went into Golden Point time courtesy of a Kyle Feldt try in the dying moments to level the scores at 16 all. But the game would be remembered <b>for</b> <b>Ben</b> Hunt's dropped ball from the kick-off to extra time which led to Johnathan Thurston's field goal that gave North Queensland their first ever premiership in the NRL since being admitted into the competition in 1995. Apart from games involving national teams, the crowd is the largest ever in NSW not to involve a team based in the state.|$|E
25|$|The 2016-2017 season {{would be}} their 50th anniversary along with the other, still active 1967 teams (St. Louis, Philadelphia and Pittsburgh). For {{the first time since}} 2002, the LA Kings hosted the 62nd National Hockey League All-Star Game. With an injury to Jonathan Quick that had him sidelined for most {{of the first half of}} the season, the Kings {{struggled}} as Peter Budaj filled the void having his first starting duties since his time with the Colorado Avalanche. Eventually he would be traded to Tampa Bay <b>for</b> <b>Ben</b> Bishop. Despite the trade, the Kings ultimately missed the playoffs for the 2nd time in 3 seasons. General Manager Dean Lombardi and Head Coach Darryl Sutter would be both relieved of their duties with Rob Blake becoming the new General Manager and John Stevens to be promoted to Head Coach after serving as Associate Head Coach for the Kings for several seasons. In the 2017 NHL Expansion Draft the Vegas Golden Knights picked up defenseman Brayden McNabb who had been left unprotected by the Kings.|$|E
