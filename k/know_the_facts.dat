25|$|Even so, it wasn't until February 1452 that Charles finally {{consented to}} see d'Estouteville. In his {{capacity}} as papal legate, he {{handed over the}} inquiry to the Inquisitor of France, Jean Bréhal. On 2 May 1452, the inquisitor questioned witnesses connected with the case, followed by more thorough testimony beginning on May 8. This inquiry included most of the former tribunal members who were still living. Though Charles was keen to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> behind the case, he was not enamored of {{the thought of the}} Inquisition running a high-profile case in France outside of royal control. But through d'Estouteville's intervention, by December 1452 the case had taken {{on a life of its}} own, independent of Charles.|$|E
25|$|The {{whole notion}} of {{politics}} is they always present you with this or this or this. I'll get a newspaper to read between the lines. Why {{do you have to}} adhere to prescribed formulas that they have and people argue over them and they're all in a box. And you watch Fox claw CNN, and CNN claw Fox. Sometimes I catch a piece of the news and it seems insanity to me. I quietly support candidates. I'm not out there banging a drum for candidates. But I have supported a candidate and it's a whole other world. Once you've been exposed to it, once or twice or however many times, if you <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> and see how they're presented, it's mind-boggling. It's a very scary arena to be in, but I do vote. I go in there and pull the lever. It's kind of like pulling the lever and watching the trap door fall out from beneath you. Why should we trust any of these people? None of them ever deliver on anything. It's always disappointing.|$|E
500|$|Garrett's 11-year-old son Richard was an eyewitness. In later years, {{he became}} a Baptist {{minister}} and widely lectured on the events of Booth's demise at his family's farm. In 1921, Garrett's lecture {{was published in the}} Confederate Veteran as the [...] "True Story of the Capture of John Wilkes Booth." [...] According to his account, Booth and Herold arrived at the Garretts' farm, located on the road to Bowling Green, around 3p.m. on Monday afternoon. Confederate mail delivery had ceased {{with the collapse of the}} Confederate government, he explained, so the Garretts were unaware of Lincoln's assassination. After having dinner with the Garretts that evening, Booth learned of the surrender of Johnston's army, the last Confederate armed force of any size. Its capitulation meant that the Civil War was unquestionably over and Booth's attempt had failed to save the Confederacy by Lincoln's assassination. The Garretts also finally learned of Lincoln's death and the substantial reward for Booth's capture. Booth, said Garrett, displayed no reaction other than to ask if the family would turn in the fugitive should they have the opportunity. Still not aware of their guest's true identity, one of the older Garrett sons averred that they might, if only because they needed the money. The next day, Booth told the Garretts that he intended to reach Mexico, drawing a route on a map of theirs. Biographer Theodore Roscoe said of Garrett's account, [...] "Almost nothing written or testified in respect to the doings of the fugitives at Garrett's farm can be taken at face value. Nobody knows exactly what Booth said to the Garretts, or they to him." [...] Garrett was present at the time and was more likely to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> than later biographers.|$|E

On July 23, Glenn Beck talked about the story on his program, Headline News, recommending that Edwards sue the Enquirer if its story was proven false. On that same day, Roxanne Roberts, a style writer for The Washington Post, said, [...] "We have no evidence this is true. Lots of juicy details—enough so Edwards may feel he has to address the issue, especially if it's not true and there's an innocent explanation. Or not.

Caylee has passed on far, far too soon, and what my driving force has been {{for the last three years}} has been always to make sure that there has been justice for Caylee and Casey because Casey did not murder Caylee.

2500|$|Due to Austria's {{delay in}} writing the ultimatum, the element of {{surprise}} that Germany had counted upon in the war against Serbia was lost. Instead, the strategy of [...] "localization" [...] was adopted, which meant that when the Austro-Serbian war began, Germany would pressure other powers not to become involved even at the risk of war. On 19 July, Jagow published a note in the semi-official North German Gazette warning other powers [...] "that the settlement of differences which may arise between Austria-Hungary and Serbia should remain localized". Asked by Jules Cambon, the French Ambassador to Germany, how he knew about the contents of the Austrian ultimatum as he had revealed in the North German Gazette, Gottlieb von Jagow pretended to be ignorant of it. Sir Horace Rumbold of the British Embassy in Berlin reported: [...] "We do not <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts.</b> The German government clearly do know. They know what the Austrian government is going to demand... and I think we may say with some assurance that they had expressed approval of those demands and promised support should dangerous complications ensure... the German government did not believe that there is any danger of war." ...|$|E
2500|$|The modern {{jury trial}} evolved {{out of this}} custom in the mid-12th century {{during the reign of}} Henry II. [...] Juries, usually 6 or 12 men, were an [...] "ancient institution" [...] even then in some parts of England, {{at the same time as}} Members {{consisted}} of representatives of the basic units of local government—hundreds (an administrative sub-division of the shire, embracing several vills) and villages. Called juries of presentment, these men testified under oath to crimes committed in their neighbourhood. [...] The Assize of Clarendon in 1166 caused these juries to be adopted systematically throughout the country. [...] The jury in this period was [...] "self-informing," [...] meaning it heard very little evidence or testimony in court. Instead, jurors were recruited from the locality of the dispute and were expected to <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> before coming to court. [...] The source of juror knowledge could include first-hand knowledge, investigation, and less reliable sources such as rumour and hearsay. John A. Makdisi argues that many concepts of English common law, including juries at least partly, derive from Islamic law. In the same period as William the Conqueror conquered England, Norman adventurers led by Robert Guiscard had taken Sicily, previously under the Arab Fatimid Caliphate. Thus, Makdisi claims, English law became influenced by the Islamic law used in Sicily under the Fatimids, including the use of the twelve man jury. Makdisi suggests that Henry II's laws would have been influenced through people such as Thomas Brown, a member of Henry's government who had previously served in the Sicilian government.|$|E

2500|$|On October 14, 1994, Pulp Fiction {{went into}} general release in the United States. As Peter Biskind describes, [...] "It was not platformed, that is, {{it did not}} open {{in a handful of}} theaters and roll out slowly as word of mouth built, the {{traditional}} way of releasing an indie film; it went wide immediately, into 1,100 theaters." [...] In the eyes of some cultural critics, Reservoir Dogs had given Tarantino a reputation for glamorizing violence. Miramax played with the issue in its marketing campaign: [...] "You won't <b>know</b> <b>the</b> <b>facts</b> till you've seen the fiction", went one slogan. Pulp Fiction was the top-grossing film at the box office its first weekend, edging out a Sylvester Stallone vehicle, The Specialist, which was in its second week and playing at {{more than twice as many}} theaters. Against its budget of $8.5 million and about $10 million in marketing costs, Pulp Fiction wound up grossing $107.93 million at the U.S. box office, making it the first [...] "indie" [...] film to surpass $100 million. Worldwide, it took in nearly $213 million. In terms of domestic grosses, it was the tenth biggest film of 1994, even though it played on substantially fewer screens than any other film in the top 20. Popular engagement with the film, such as speculation about the contents of the precious briefcase, [...] "indicates the kind of cult status that Pulp Fiction achieved almost immediately." [...] As MovieMaker puts it, [...] "The movie was nothing less than a national cultural phenomenon." [...] Abroad, as well: In Britain, where it opened a week after its U.S. release, not only was the film a big hit, but in book form its screenplay became the most successful in UK publishing history, a top-ten bestseller.|$|E
