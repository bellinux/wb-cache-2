[...] After graduating from the University of British Columbia in 1972, Satin immersed himself in all these movements, either directly or {{as a reporter for}} Canada's underground press. [...] He also took up residence in a free-love commune. [...] "One fierce winter's day", he says,"... <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that the ideas and energies from the various 'fringe' movements [...] beginning to generate a coherent new politics. [...] But I looked in vain for the people and groups that were expressing that new politics (instead of merely bits and pieces of it)". [...] Satin set out to write a book that would express the new politics in all its dimensions. [...] He wrote, designed, typeset, and printed the first edition of New Age Politics himself, in 1976. [...] A 240-page edition was published by Vancouver's Whitecap Books in 1978, and a 349-page edition by Dell Publishing Company in New York in 1979. It is now widely regarded as the [...] "first", [...] "most ambitious", or [...] "most adequate" [...] attempt to offer a systemic overview of the new post-socialist politics arising {{in the wake of the}} New Left. [...] Some academics say it offers a new ideology.|$|E

[...] "When I looked around me, I saw that white tennis players, {{some of whom}} I had thrashed on the court, were picking up offers and invitations," [...] she wrote. [...] "Suddenly <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that my triumphs had not destroyed the racial barriers once and for all, as I had—perhaps naively—hoped. Or if I did destroy them, they had been erected behind me again." ...|$|E
2500|$|Herzog's {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Aguirre was actor Klaus Kinski. The two had met many years earlier when the then-struggling young actor rented a room in Herzog’s family apartment, and Kinski’s often terrifying and {{deranged}} antics during the three months he lived there left a lasting impression on the director. Years later, Herzog remembered the volatile actor and knew that he was the only possible man who could play the mad Aguirre, and he sent Kinski a copy of the screenplay. [...] "Between three and four in the morning, the phone rang," [...] Herzog recalled. [...] "It took me {{at least a couple of}} minutes before I realized that it was Kinski who was the source of this inarticulate screaming. And after an hour of this, <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that he found it the most fascinating screenplay and wanted to be Aguirre." ...|$|E

I {{nonetheless}} had a premonition that somehow I would die here. <b>It</b> never <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> until soon after 1989's Velvet Revolution that first I could live here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Seeing {{that in all}} {{probability}} you were watching the wives and daughters {{of most of the}} kings of India, the chances are that you won't,' I said, for <b>it</b> was <b>dawning</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that Mulvaney had stumbled upon a big Queens' Praying at Benares.|$|R
5000|$|At times... {{missed my}} normal childhood, but then, <b>it</b> <b>dawns</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> {{that even if}} I lose my childhood, it's okay. Playing with friends is not more {{important}} than saving a life. —Palak Muchhal (in 2007) [...] Muchhal {{became a member of}} Kalyanji-Anandji Little Star, a group of young singers, when she was four years old. During the Kargil War of 1999, when aged seven, she spent a week singing at shops in her home city, Indore, to raise funds for the families of deceased Indian soldiers. Her efforts received substantial coverage in Indian media and she raised 25,000 (US$810). Later that year, she sang to raise funds for victims of the 1999 Odisha cyclone.|$|R
60|$|But we {{were quite}} a party: the second bus-driver and his mate, a bearded {{traveller}} {{on the second}} bus, with his daughter, ourselves, the bright-faced citizen from Nuoro, and our driver. Our little dark-eyed conductor did not come. <b>It</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> later he {{could not afford to}} pay for this meal, which was not included in his wage.|$|E
6000|$|She paused, before {{following}} him, {{to watch}} {{the progress of the}} other passenger. [...] "Poor old man!" [...] she said. [...] "How weak and ill he looks! It was a shame to let him be turned away like that. I'm very sorry--" [...] At this moment <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that these words were not addressed to me, but that she was unconsciously thinking aloud. I moved away a few steps, and waited to follow her into the carriage, where I resumed the conversation.|$|E
6000|$|With my last {{flickering}} ray {{of consciousness}} I turned mechanically toward the distance meter. It stood at exactly five {{hundred miles from}} the earth's surface--and then {{of a sudden the}} huge thing that bore us came to a stop. The rattle of hurtling rock through the hollow jacket ceased. The wild racing of the giant drill betokened that it was running loose in AIR--and then another truth flashed upon me. The point of the prospector was ABOVE us. Slowly <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that since passing through the ice strata it had been above. We had turned in the ice and sped upward toward the earth's crust. Thank God! We were safe! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "For instance, <b>it</b> {{has been}} <b>dawning</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> of late that there's {{a good deal}} that's rather nice in Elcot. Now try to be reasonable, {{and tell me what}} the trouble is." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Then hadn't {{you better}} pump her out?" [...] {{retorted}} Vane. [...] "After that, you can light the stove. <b>It's</b> beginning to <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that <b>it's</b> {{a long while}} since I had anything to eat." ...|$|R
60|$|Then <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> {{that the}} fire was at Gaspard's Trail and I sat still a minute, irresolute. I {{had no doubt that}} the recent {{purchaser}} was merely acting for Lane, and I felt tempted to resume my journey; but curiosity, or the instinct which calls out each prairie settler when his neighbor's possessions are in jeopardy, was too strong for me, and I rode towards the blaze, but much more slowly. It was one thing to risk a broken limb when danger appeared to threaten Bonaventure, but quite another to do so for the sake of an unscrupulous adversary. It would have been well for me had I obeyed the first impulse which prompted me--and turned my back upon the fire.|$|E
60|$|And while I don't {{remember}} anything my uncle said or {{did at the}} wedding, I do remember very distinctly certain little things, scrutiny, solicitude, a curious rare flash of intimacy in my aunt's eyes. <b>It</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that I wasn't hiding anything from her at all. She was dressed very smartly, wearing a big-plumed hat that made her neck seem longer and slenderer than ever, and when she walked up the aisle with that rolling stride of hers and her eye all on Marion, perplexed into self-forgetfulness, it wasn't somehow funny. She was, I do believe, giving my marriage more thought than I had done, she was concerned beyond measure at my black rage and Marion's blindness, she was looking with eyes that knew what loving is--for love.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why this tone of suspicion?" [...] remonstrated Heyst. [...] "I {{suppose the}} sight of this {{particular}} distress was disagreeable to me. What you call fun came afterwards, when <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that I was for him a walking, breathing, incarnate proof of the efficacy of prayer. I was a little fascinated by it--and then, could I have argued with him? You don't argue against such evidence, and besides it would have looked as if I had wanted to claim all the merit. Already his gratitude was simply frightful. Funny position, wasn't it? The boredom came later, when we lived together on board his ship. I had, {{in a moment of}} inadvertence, created for myself a tie. How to define it precisely I don't know. One gets attached in a way to people one has done something for. But is that friendship? I am not sure what it was. I only know that he who forms a tie is lost. The germ of corruption has entered into his soul." ...|$|E
40|$|In recent talks, I {{mentioned}} how my artist friends often {{complain that}} their clients see with their ears. <b>It</b> recently <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that nobody understood what I said, or—worse—got the wrong idea. The audience thinks of bionic devices (Proulx, Stoerig, Ludowig, & Knoll, 2008) or bat echo location (Moss & Sinha, 2003) —not my intention at all. So what might this ‘‘seeing with the ears’’ be...|$|R
5000|$|It wasn't {{until his}} Inji, who {{was engaged to}} be married, came {{bursting}} into my room at Bodhi Mandala in New Mexico after lunch one day during an autumn sesshin, sobbing and saying, [...] "He won't leave me alone", that <b>it</b> finally <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that this was real. Until then I truly did not believe any of the rumors because of my own conditioned ignorance.|$|R
5000|$|Olsen's script {{attracted}} producer Larry Brezner, {{who brought}} it to Imagine Films. It was greeted with a warm reception from Brian Grazer. [...] "I liked {{the concept of a}} regular guy taking a vacation in his own neighborhood, plus it was funny and well written. <b>It</b> suddenly <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that Joe Dante would be fantastic a director because it's a mixture of comedy, horror, and reality." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'He {{is not an}} American at all. He {{was born}} and bred in my own country, and took me by {{surprise}} by calculating that I {{was one of the}} Audleys of Wrightstone Court, and wanting to know whether my father were Sir Robert or Sir Robert's son. Then he guessed that I might have heard of his father, if I was not too young, and by-and-by <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> that whenever there is any complication about business matters, or any one is in bad circumstances, my father always vituperates one Travis, who, it seems, was a solicitor greatly trusted by all the country round, till he died, some twenty years ago, and it appeared that he had ruined everybody, himself included. These men are his sons. They went out to America, and got up in the world. They told me the whole story of how they had knocked about everywhere, last evening, but I was too sleepy to enter into it much, though I daresay it was curious enough; successful speculations and hair's-breadth escapes seemed to come very thick one upon another, but all I am clear about is that this poor boy, Fernando's mother was a Mexican heiress, they--one of them, I mean--managed to marry, her father English, but her mother old Spanish blood allied to the old Caciques, he says; whether it is a boast I don't know, but the boy looks like it--such a handsome fellow; delicate straight profile, slender limbs, beautifully made, inky-black hair and brows, pure olive skin--the two doctors were both in raptures. Well, they thought affairs in Mexico insecure, so they sold the poor woman's estate and carried her off to Texas. No; was it? I really can't remember where; but, at any rate, Diego stuck to her wherever she went, and when she died, to her child; nursed him like an old woman, and-- In short, it was that touching negro love that one sometimes hears of. Now they seem to have grown very rich--the American Vice-Consul, who came over this morning from Dearport, knew all about them--and they came home partly on business, and partly to leave Fernando to be made into an English gentleman, who, Mr. Travis says, if he has money to spend, does whip creation. He's English enough for that still. Well, they have got a telegram that makes them both want to sail by the next steamer.' ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{idea behind}} Dimmi {{was created by}} Stevan Premutico on a coffee shop napkin in 2007.

5000|$|It wasn't until I was settled, {{facing a}} nice little family group--mother, daddy, baby--that <b>it</b> <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> how funny that episode had been. My zipless fuck!

5000|$|I {{saw it as}} a {{great movie}} yarn, full of {{enormously}} interesting people... only later did <b>it</b> <b>dawn</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> {{that this was not a}} regular Western myth. There was something timely -- and timeless -- about it, something that had a direct bearing on life today. To me it was the story of a man who must make a decision according to his conscience. His town -- symbol of a democracy gone soft -- faces a horrendous threat to its people's way of life. Determined to resist, and in deep trouble, he moves all over the place looking for support but finding that there is nobody who will help him; each has a reason of his own for not getting involved. In the end, he must meet his chosen fate all by himself, his town's doors and windows firmly locked against him. It is a story that still happens everywhere, every day.|$|R
5000|$|<b>It</b> kind of <b>dawned</b> <b>on</b> <b>me</b> {{that being}} 5-foot-9 {{and having a}} surgically {{repaired}} knee and not being out-of-this-world talented, the cards were stacked against me...I was better off getting a degree and focusing my time on music.

5000|$|After his {{military}} service, {{he moved to}} Brooklyn and began working at a small electronics retailer. He became familiar with profit margins for electronics, then worked as a sales representative in web sales.

500|$|During World War II, Miller {{served as}} part of a bomber crew that participated in the {{destruction}} of the ancient Roman Catholic monastery at Monte Cassino, Italy, founded by St. Benedict in the 6thcentury.
