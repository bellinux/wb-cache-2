25|$|Human {{epidemiology}} {{is used as}} a {{basis for}} risk estimation for cancer, acute radiation risks, and cataracts. This approach is not viable for estimating CNS risks from space radiation, however. At doses above a few Gy, detrimental CNS changes occur in humans who are treated with radiation (e.g., gamma rays and protons) for cancer. Treatment doses of 50 Gy are typical, which is well above the exposures in space even if a large SPE were to occur. Thus, of the four categories of space radiation risks (cancer, CNS, degenerative, and acute radiation syndromes), the CNS risk relies most extensively on experimental data with animals for its evidence base. Understanding and mitigating CNS risks requires a vigorous research program that will draw on the basic understanding that is gained from cellular and animal models, and on the development of approaches to <b>extrapolate</b> <b>risks</b> and the potential benefits of countermeasures for astronauts.|$|R

40|$|The {{health risks}} from low-dose sparsely {{ionizing}} (low-LET) radiation {{have been the}} subject of continued debate.

Nevertheless, much can be learned about the nature of the health risks by reviewing the epidemiologic literature. We present a summary of diseases which have been associated with low-LET radiation (less than 1000 rad) in at least two independent studies, according to the mean cumulative organ dose at which the disease was observed. At organ doses of less than or equal to 50 rad, the only diseases that have been reported consistently are thyroid cancer, salivary gland tumors, and leukemia. The first two diseases were observed in association with x-ray epilation of the scalp for tinea capitis, a therapy which is no longer employed.

We conducted a genetic case-control study using data from 2294 cases and 2294 controls selected from the Melbourne Collaborative Cohort Study, matched on age, sex and region of origin. Four consistently replicated CFH single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) were genotyped: rs 1061170 (Y 402 H), rs 2274700, rs 393955 and rs 800292; their relationship with AMD prevalence was determined across the age range 48 - 86. A difference in genotype frequencies was seen across age groups, where the low-risk homozygote prevalence rose with each increasing age group. Associations with early AMD were strongly modified by age for three of the four SNPs (interaction P-value: 0. 01 - 0. 00003). An inverse association between the high-risk homozygote for each SNP and early AMD was observed in the younger age groups [odds ratios (OR) range 0. 37 - 0. 48 for age 75). The direction of associations for this gene change was from inverse to risk with increasing age.

The need to identify sources of biological control agents for importation added to this demand. Independently, biogeographers mapped {{species distribution}}s to interpolate their niche requirements. Recently the threat of climate change caused an explosion in demand for guidance on likely shifts in potential distributions of species. The different technology platforms in the two sectors resulted in divergence in their approaches to mapping actual and potential species distributions under rapidly changing environmental scenarios. Much of the contemporary discussion of species mapping ignores the lessons from the history of pest species distribution modelling. This has major implications for modelling of the non-equilibrium distributions of all species that occur with rapid climate change. The current review is intended to remind researchers of historical findings and their significance for current mapping of all species. I argue that the dream of automating species mapping for multiple species is an illusion. More modest goals and use of other approaches are necessary to protect biodiversity under current and future climates. Pest risk mapping tools have greater prospects of success because they are generic in nature and so able to be used both to interpolate and to extrapolate from field observations of any species based on climatic variables.

Aim To produce a risk assessment model for PC based on familial background of related cancers. Method 976 859 independent index men aged >= 30 in year 1998 and their family members in the Swedish Family-Cancer Database (FCD 2010) were randomly divided into development (60 %) and validation (40 %) datasets (follow-up 10 years). The HR from Cox model was used to <b>extrapolate</b> <b>risk</b> scores. Results Specified scores were: for PC in situ at age = 60 years in each FDR, 10; for PC at age < 60 years in each second-degree relative, 5; for breast cancer in each FDR, 2; for oesophageal carcinoma in situ in index man, 2; and for oesophagus cancer in each FDR, 2. Based on the findings, if the milestone age for a PC screening programme was 60 years or more, the recommended starting age for the men with the score-group 6 - 10 would be 54 years; score-group 11 - 15, 52 years; score-group 16 - 20, 50 years; score-group 21 - 25, 44 years; and for the score-group 26 + it should start before age 40.

40|$|Assessing the {{biological}} {{risks associated with}} exposure to the high-energy charged particles encountered in space {{is essential for the}} success of long-term space exploration. Although prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell models developed in our laboratory and others have advanced our understanding of many aspects of genotoxicity, in vitro models are needed to assess the risk to humans from space radiation insults. Such models must be representative of the cellular interactions present in tissues and capable of quantifying I genotoxic damage. Toward this overall goal, the objectives of this study were to examine the effect of the localized microenvironment of cells, cultured as either 2 -dimensional (2 D) monolayers or 3 -dimensional (3 D) aggregates, on the rate and type of genotoxic damage resulting from exposure to iron charged particles, a significant portion of space radiation. We used rodent transgenic cell lines containing 50 - 70 copies of a LacI transgene to provide the enhanced sensitivity required to quantify mutational frequency and type in the 1, 100 -bp LacI target as well as assessment of DNA,damage to the entire 45 -kbp construct. Cultured cells were exposed to high-ener~ir on charged particles at Brookhaven National Laboratory s Alternating Gradient Synchrotron facility for a total dose of 0, 0. 1, 0. 25, 0. 5, 1. 0, or 2. 0 Gy and allowed to recover for 0, 1, or 7 days, after which mutational type and frequency were evaluated. The mutational frequency was found to be higher in 3 D samples than in 2 D samples at all radiation doses. Mutational frequency also was higher at 7 days after irradiation than immediately after exposure. DNA sequencing of the mutant targets revealed that deletional mutations contributed an increasingly high percentage (up to 27 %) of all mutations in cells as the dose was increased from 0. 5 to 2 Gy. Several mutants also showed large and complex deletions in multiple locations within the Lac 1 target. However, no differences in mutational type were found between the 2 D and the 3 D samples.

Malaria control is further complicated by combinations of vector species that respond differently to control interventions. Recent modelling innovations make it possible to predict vector distributions and <b>extrapolate</b> malaria <b>risk</b> continentally, but these risk mapping efforts have not yet bridged the spatial gap to guide on-the-ground control efforts. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used Maximum Entropy with purpose-built, high resolution land cover data and other environmental factors to model the spatial distributions of the three dominant malaria vector species in a 94, 000 km 2 region of east Africa. Remotely sensed land cover was necessary in each vector’s niche model. Seasonality of precipitation and maximum annual temperature also contributed to niche models for Anopheles arabiensis and An. funestus s. l.

RIFs are characterized by the local recruitment of DNA damage sensing proteins such as p 53 binding protein (53 BP 1). Here, we provide strong evidence for the existence of repair centers. We used live imaging and mathematical fitting of RIF kinetics to show that RIF induction rate increases with increasing radiation dose, whereas the rate at which RIFs disappear decreases. We show that multiple DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) 1 to 2 μm apart can rapidly cluster into repair centers. Correcting mathematically for the dose dependence of induction/resolution rates, we observe an absolute RIF yield that is surprisingly much smaller at higher doses: 15  RIF/Gy after 2 Gy exposure compared to approximately 64  RIF/Gy after 0. 1 Gy. Cumulative RIF counts from time lapse of 53 BP 1 -GFP in human breast cells confirmed these results. The standard model currently in use applies a linear scale, <b>extrapolating</b> cancer <b>risk</b> from high doses to low doses of ionizing radiation.

Our goal is to integrate in vitro liver experiments with agent-based cellular models to simulate a spatially extended hepatic lobule.

We analyzed the effects of vascular topology and metabolism on the cell-level distribution following oral exposure to chemicals. The spatial distribution of metabolically inactive chemicals was similar across different vascular networks and a baseline well-mixed compartment. When chemicals were rapidly metabolized, concentration heterogeneity of the parent compound increased across the vascular network. As a result, our spatially extended lobule generated greater variability in dose-dependent cellular responses, in this case apoptosis, than were observed in the classical well-mixed liver or in a parallel tubes model. The mass-balanced graphical approach to modeling the hepatic lobule is computationally efficient for simulating long-term exposure, modular for incorporating complex cellular interactions, and flexible for dealing with evolving tissues...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com As health care budgets are under pressure, evaluation of cost-effectiveness is of increasing importance to provide arguments to {{insurance companies to}} pay for diagnostic procedures or for specific treatments. Methodology for cost-effectiveness analyses has been evolving {{over the last years}} but is still complex and based on various assumptions. In their study, Van Nooten et al. evaluated the costeffectiveness of lipid-lowering therapy in patients with coronary heart disease or type 2 diabetes [1]. The authors conclude that the combination of ezetimibe and simvastatin is cost-effective in primary prevention of vascular events in patients not achieving the advocated low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) goal of 2. 5 mmol/l on statin treatment alone. The methodology used in the paper to estimate and calculate costs is common practice in the economic evaluation of health care costs. On the effectivity side of the paper, the authors assume that LDL-C reduction with statin monotherapy compared with combination therapy with ezetimibe and statin is equally effective in reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. However, there is no evidence from randomised clinical trials, with clinical events as endpoints, showing that the results from statin monotherapy trials can be <b>extrapolated</b> to <b>risk</b> reduction by LDL-C reduction as a result of combination therapy.

40|$|A central tenet in {{understanding}} the biological effects of ionizing radiation {{has been that the}} initially affected cells were directly damaged by the radiation. By contrast, evidence has emerged concerning “bystander” responses involving damage to nearby cells that were not themselves directly traversed by the radiation. These long-range effects are of interest both mechanistically and for assessing risks from low-dose exposures, where only a small proportion of cells are directly hit. Bystander effects have been observed largely by using single-cell in vitro systems that do not have realistic multicellular morphology; no studies have as yet been reported in three-dimensional, normal human tissue. Given that the bystander phenomenon must involve cell-to-cell interactions, the relevance of such single-cell in vitro studies is questionable, and thus the significance of bystander responses for human health has remained unclear. Here, we describe bystander responses in a three-dimensional, normal human-tissue system. Endpoints were induction of micronucleated and apoptotic cells. A charged-particle microbeam was used, allowing irradiation of cells in defined locations in the tissue yet guaranteeing that no cells located more than a few micrometers away receive any radiation exposure. Unirradiated cells up to 1 mm distant from irradiated cells showed a significant enhancement in effect over background, with an average increase in effect of 1. 7 -fold for micronuclei and 2. 8 -fold for apoptosis. The surprisingly long range of bystander signals in human tissue suggests that bystander responses may be important in <b>extrapolating</b> radiation <b>risk</b> estimates from epidemiologically accessible doses down to very low doses where nonhit bystander cells will predominate...|$|R
40|$|Non-targeted (bystander) {{effects of}} {{ionizing}} radiation {{are caused by}} intercellular signaling; they include production of DNA damage and alterations in cell fate (i. e. apoptosis, differentiation, senescence or proliferation). Biophysical models capable of quantifying these effects may improve cancer risk estimation at radiation doses below the epidemiological detection threshold. Understanding the spatial patterns of bystander responses is important, because it provides estimates of how many bystander cells are affected per irradiated cell. In a first approach to modeling of bystander spatial effects in a three-dimensional artificial tissue, we assumed the following: (1) The bystander phenomenon results from signaling molecules (S) that rapidly propagate from irradiated cells and decrease in concentration (exponentially {{in the case of}} planar symmetry) as distance increases. (2) These signals can convert cells to a long-lived epigenetically activated state, e. g. a state of oxidative stress; cells in this state are more prone to DNA damage and behavior alterations than normal and therefore exhibit an increased response (R) for many end points (e. g. apoptosis, differentiation, micronucleation). These assumptions were implemented by a mathematical formalism and computational algorithms. The model adequately described data on bystander responses in the 3 D system using a small number of adjustable parameters. Mathematical models of radiation carcinogenesis are important for understanding mechanisms and for interpreting or <b>extrapolating</b> <b>risk.</b> There are two classes of such models: (1) long-term formalisms that track pre-malignant cell numbers throughout an entire lifetime but treat initial radiation dose-response simplistically and (2) short-term formalisms that provide a detailed initial dose-response even for complicated radiation protocols, but address its modulation during the subsequent cancer latency period only indirectly. We argue that integrating short- and long-term models is needed. As an example of this novel approach, we integrated a stochastic short-term initiation/inactivation/repopulation model with a deterministic two-stage long-term model. Within this new formalism, the following assumptions are implemented: radiation initiates, promotes, or kills pre-malignant cells; a pre-malignant cell generates a clone, which, if it survives, quickly reaches a size limitation; the clone subsequently grows more slowly and can eventually generate a malignant cell; the carcinogenic potential of pre-malignant cells decreases with age. The effectiveness of high-LET radiation per unit dose increases as dose rate decreases. This “inverse dose rate effect” is seen in radon-induced lung carcinogenesis. We suggest a biologically-motivated mechanism based on radiation-induced direct and bystander-effect-related risks: During radon exposure, only a fraction of cells are traversed by alpha particles. These irradiated cells have an increased probability of being initiated into a pre-malignant state. They release signals, which convert some nearby unirradiated cells to an activated state. When already pre-malignant cells are activated, their proliferation (promotion) rate increases. If a radiation dose is sufficient to activate most susceptible cells, protracting the exposure does not substantially decrease the number of activated cells, but prolongs the activated state during which pre-malignant cell proliferation is accelerated. This mechanism is implemented in a low-dose-rate extension of our carcinogenesis model, which integrates both short- and long-term modeling approaches, and was applied to radiotherapy-induced second cancer risk estimation. Model predictions adequately describe the data on radon-induced lung carcinogenesis in humans and rats, using few adjustable parameters. Conclusions about the relative importance of promotion vs. initiation for radon carcinogenesis are similar to those reported with the two-stage clonal expansion model, but a mechanistic explanation for promotion is provided...|$|R

It is common practice to apply the Kaplan 2 ̆ 013 Meier or Aalen 2 ̆ 013 Johansen estimator to the total sample and report either the estimated cumulative incidence curve or just a single point on the curve as a description of the disease risk. Methods We argue that, whenever the disease or disorder of interest is influenced by calendar time trends, the total sample Kaplan 2 ̆ 013 Meier and Aalen 2 ̆ 013 Johansen estimators do not provide useful estimates of the general risk in the target population. We present some alternatives to this type of analysis. Results We show how a proportional hazards model may be used to <b>extrapolate</b> disease <b>risk</b> estimates if proportionality is a reasonable assumption. If not reasonable, we instead advocate that a more useful description of the disease risk lies in the age-specific cumulative incidence curves across strata given by time of entry or perhaps just the end of follow-up estimates across all strata. Finally, we argue that a weighted average of these end of follow-up estimates may be a useful summary measure of the disease risk within the study period. Conclusions Time trends in a disease risk will render total sample estimators less useful in observational studies with staggered entry and administrative censoring. An analysis based on proportional hazards or a stratified analysis may be better alternatives...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that ionizing radiation increases cancer risks at high doses (e. g.,> 1 Gy), and persua-sive, if controversial, epidemiological evidence that cancer risks are increased at low doses (10 mGy). Discussed here are the issues related to <b>extrapolating</b> radiation <b>risks</b> from low radiation doses to very low doses (< 1 mGy) — for which purpose {{we are forced to}} rely on radiobiological evidence and biophysical arguments. At high doses, cells are typically hit by many tracks of radiation, while at low doses most cells are typically hit by a single track of radiation; at very low doses proportionately fewer cells are hit, again only by a single track of radiation. Thus, in comparing low doses to very low doses, the damage to hit cells remains essentially the same (a single radiation track passing through a cell), but what changes is the number of cells that are subjected to this same damage, which decreases linearly as the dose decreases. This is the argument for a linear no-threshold (LNT) model. It is important to emphasize that this LNT argument only applies to the extrap-olation from low doses to very low doses, not from high to low doses. Of course there are caveats to this argument, such as the potential effects of phenomena such as inter-cellular commu-nication and immunosurveillance, and the possibility of differ-ent radiobiological processes at very low doses, compared to low doses. However, there is little conclusive experimental evidence about the significance of these phenomena at very low doses, and comparative mechanistic studies at high doses vs. low doses will not be informative in this context. At present, we do not know whether such radiobiological phenomena would produce small or large perturbations, or even whether they would increase or decrease cancer risks at very low doses, compared with the prediction of a linear extrapolation from low doses...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND—A factory fire in Tranmere, Merseyside, England, {{deposited}} asbestos containing fallout in {{an urban}} area. There was considerable community anxiety for months after the incident. Therefore {{an assessment of the}} long term health risks of this acute environmental incident were requested by the local health authority.  METHODS—The facts of the incident were gathered and appraised from unpublished and press reports, involved personnel, and further analysis of material collected {{at the time of the}} incident. The literature on the long term health risks of asbestos was reviewed, and combined with evidence on asbestos exposure to estimate community health risk.  RESULTS—Risk was almost entirely from exposure to fire fallout of chrysotile in asbestos bitumen paper covering the factory roof. Amosite was only detected in a few samples and in trace amounts. The number of people who lived in the area of fallout was 16   000 to 48   000. From a non-threshold model with assumptions likely to overestimate risk, the lung cancer risk is estimated to be undetectably small. Risk of mesothelioma from chrysotile exposure, and risks of lung cancer and mesothelioma from amosite exposure were based on observational studies and were estimated to be even lower than that of lung cancer risk from chrysotile exposure. Academically, there are assumptions that while reasonable cannot be proven, for example, the validity of <b>extrapolating</b> observed <b>risk</b> from much higher exposures to lower exposures, estimates of individual exposure, and that there is no threshold for asbestos to cause cancer.  CONCLUSIONS—The author is unaware of a similar study on long term health risks in a community exposed to asbestos in a fire. It is concluded that, using methods that do not underestimate risk, risk is undetectably small. Practical lessons from this methodology and approach to health risk assessment are discussed.    Keywords: asbestos; environmental pollutants; mesothelioma; health risk assessment; lung cance...|$|R
40|$|To {{get more}} insight into {{possible}} species {{differences in the}} bioactivation of estragole, the kinetics for sulfonation of the proximate carcinogen 1 '-hydroxyestragole were compared for male rat, male mouse, and mixed gender human liver S 9 homogenates. In order to quantify sulfonation, 2 '-deoxyguanosine {{was added to the}} incubation mixture in which sulfonation of 1 '-hydroxyestragole was catalyzed to trap the reactive 1 '-sulfooxyestragole. A method was developed with which the formation of the most abundant adduct with 2 '-deoxyguanosine could be quantified using isotope dilution LC-ESI-MS/MS. Comparing the kinetics for sulfonation by liver S 9 homogenates of male rat, male mouse, and humans revealed that sulfonation was about 30 times more efficient by male rat liver S 9 than by human liver S 9, whereas the catalytic efficiency by male mouse and human liver S 9 was about the same. This indicates, as far as the bioactivation by sulfotransferase is concerned, that when <b>extrapolating</b> the cancer <b>risk</b> from laboratory animals to humans, using data from male rats may overestimate the cancer risk in humans, whereas using data from male mice may provide a better estimate of the cancer risk in human...|$|R
40|$|There {{is strong}} {{evidence}} that biological response to ionizing radiation has a contribution from unirradiated ‘‘bystander’’ cells that respond to signals emitted by irradiated cells. We discuss here an approach incorporating a radiobiological by-stander response, superimposed on a direct response due to direct energy deposition in cell nuclei. A quantitative model based on this approach is described for a-particle-induced in vitro oncogenic transformation. The model postulates that the oncogenic bystander response is a binary ‘‘all or nothing’’ phenomenon in a small sensitive subpopulation of cells, and that cells from this sensitive subpopulation are also very sen-sitive to direct hits from a particles, generally resulting in a directly hit sensitive cell being inactivated. The model is ap-plied to recent data on in vitro oncogenic transformation pro-duced by broad-beam or microbeam a-particle irradiation. Two parameters are used in analyzing the data for transfor-mation frequency. The analysis suggests that, at least for a-particle-induced oncogenic transformation, bystander effects are important only at small doses—here below about 0. 2 Gy. At still lower doses, bystander effects may dominate the over-all response, possibly leading to an underestimation of low-dose <b>risks</b> <b>extrapolated</b> from intermediate doses, where direct effects dominate. q 2001 by Radiation Research Societ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractNon-syndromic {{cleft lip}} {{with or without}} cleft palate (CL/P) has severe {{long-lasting}} adverse effects on both physical and psychological development. Although recent years have brought significant improvement in clinical treatment, {{our understanding of the}} etiology of this congenital anomaly is lagging. Many genes, genetic pathways, harmful exposures, as well as nutrient deficiencies have been implicated in abnormal palatogenesis. <b>Extrapolating</b> data regarding <b>risk</b> factors for CL/P from different populations is not always straightforward. This review gives an overview of knowledge about both environmental and genetic risk factors in the etiology of CL/P in the Polish population, which was originally presented in research papers by the author and collaborating investigators. The findings suggest a possible association between maternal consumption of α-tocopherol, retinol, zinc, citrulline, and dietary compounds contributing to methyl-group homeostasis and CL/P risk. Polymorphisms in BHMT 1 and BHMT 2 were significantly associated with decreased CL/P risk in the Polish population. Other interesting findings include associations of CL/P risk with polymorphisms in MTR, PCYT 1 A, ASS 1, SLC 25 A 13, GSTM 1, GSTT 1, SUMO 1 genes, and 8 q 24. 21 loci. Reviewed research papers indicate interesting pathways and new candidate genes for further investigation, and partly confirm earlier findings according risk factors for orofacial clefts...|$|R
40|$|High {{doses of}} {{ionizing}} radiation clearly produce deleterious consequences in humans, including, but not exclusively, cancer induction. At very low radiation doses {{the situation is}} much less clear, but the risks of low-dose radiation are of societal importance in relation to issues as varied as screening tests for cancer, the future of nuclear power, occupational radiation exposure, frequent-flyer risks, manned space exploration, and radiological terrorism. We review the difficulties involved in quantifying the risks of low-dose radiation and address two specific questions. First, what is the lowest dose of x- or γ-radiation for which good evidence exists of increased cancer risks in humans? The epidemiological data {{suggest that it is}} ≈ 10 – 50 mSv for an acute exposure and ≈ 50 – 100 mSv for a protracted exposure. Second, what is the most appropriate way to <b>extrapolate</b> such cancer <b>risk</b> estimates to still lower doses? Given that it is supported by experimentally grounded, quantifiable, biophysical arguments, a linear extrapolation of cancer risks from intermediate to very low doses currently appears to be the most appropriate methodology. This linearity assumption is not necessarily the most conservative approach, and it is likely that it will result in an underestimate of some radiation-induced cancer risks and an overestimate of others...|$|R
40|$|Masked mycotoxins are plant {{metabolites}} of mycotoxins which co-contaminate common cereal crops. Since their discovery, {{the question}} has arisen if they contribute to toxicity {{either directly or indirectly}} through the release of the parent mycotoxins. Research in this field is rapidly emerging and the aim of this review is to summarize the latest knowledge on the fate of masked mycotoxins upon ingestion. Fusarium mycotoxins are the most prevalent masked mycotoxins and evidence is mounting that DON 3 Glc and possibly other masked trichothecenes are stable in conditions prevailing in the upper gut and are not absorbed intact. DON 3 Glc is also not toxic per se, but is hydrolyzed by colonic microbes and further metabolized to DOM- 1 in some individuals. Masked zearalenone is rather more bio-reactive with some evidence on gastric and small intestinal hydrolysis as well as hydrolysis by intestinal epithelium and components of blood. Microbial hydrolysis of ZEN 14 Glc is almost instantaneous and further metabolism also occurs. Identification of zearalenone metabolites and their fate in the colon are still missing as is further clarification on whether or not masked zearalenone is hydrolyzed by mammalian cells. New masked mycotoxins continuously emerge and it is crucial that we gain detailed understanding of their individual metabolic fate in the body before we can assess synergistic effects and <b>extrapolate</b> the additive <b>risk</b> of all mycotoxins present in food...|$|R
40|$|Apoptotic and DNA damage {{endpoints}} {{are frequently}} used as surrogate markers of cancer risk, {{and have been}} well-studied in the Trp 53 +/- mouse model. We report the effect of differing Trp 53 gene status on the dose response of ionizing radiation exposures (0. 01 - 2 Gy), with the unique perspective of determining if effects of gene status remain at extended time points. Here we report {{no difference in the}} dose response for radiationinduced DNA double-strand breaks in bone marrow and genomic instability (MN-RET levels) in peripheral blood, between wild-type (Trp 53 +/+) and heterozygous (Trp 53 +/-) mice. The dose response for Trp 53 +/+ mice showed higher initial levels of radiation-induced lymphocyte apoptosis relative to Trp 53 +/- between 0 and 1 Gy. Although this trend was observed up to 12 hours post-irradiation, both genotypes ultimately reached the same level of apoptosis at 14 hours, suggesting the importance of late-onset p 53 -independent apoptotic responses in this mouse model. Expected radiation-induced G 1 cell cycle delay was observed in Trp 53 +/+ but not Trp 53 +/-. Although p 53 has an important role in cancer risk, we have shown its influence on radiation dose response can be temporally variable. This research highlights the importance of caution when using haematopoietic endpoints as surrogates to <b>extrapolate</b> radiation-induced cancer <b>risk</b> estimation...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: Establish {{a method}} to {{determine}} and convey lifetime radiation risk from FFDM screening. Methods: Radiation risk from screening mammography was quantified using effective risk (number of radiation-induced cancer cases/million). For effective risk calculations, organ doses and examined breast MGD were used. Screening mammography was simulated by exposing a breast phantom for cranio-caudal and medio-lateral oblique for each breast using 16 FFDM machines. An ATOM phantom loaded with TLD dosimeters was positioned {{in contact with the}} breast phantom to simulate the client’s body. Effective risk data were analysed using SPSS software to establish a regression model to predict the effective risk of any screening programme. Graphs were generated to <b>extrapolate</b> the effective <b>risk</b> of all screening programmes for a range of commencement ages and time intervals between screens. Results: The most important parameters controlling clients’ total effective risk within breast screening are the screening commencement age and number of screens (correlation coefficients were - 0. 865 and 0. 714, respectively). Since the tissue radio-sensitivity reduces with age, the end age of screening does not result in noteworthy effect on total effective risk. Conclusions: The regression model can be used to predict the total effective risk for clients within breast screening but it cannot be used for exact assessment of total effective risk. Graphical representation of risk could be an easy way to represent risk in a fashion which might be helpful to clients and clinicians...|$|R
