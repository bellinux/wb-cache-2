40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to compare body composition {{over the course of a}} season in several <b>intercollegiate</b> women's <b>athletics</b> teams.

Body composition was determined through hydrostatic weighing, and a questionnaire examining the desire to lose or gain weight and aerobic activity pattern was given at the beginning and end of each athletic season. Using a 2 -way mixed design ANOVA with repeated measures, the statistical analysis of the body composition variables showed the GYM and SW significantly (p . 05) greater FFW than GYM, nor significantly (p >. 05) greater FW than the cc runners. The results of the study suggest that body composition among athletic teams varies, which may be a result of the unique training techniques and expertise required for different sports. Further research should involve the evaluation of body composition and its relation to athletes and their performance...|$|R
