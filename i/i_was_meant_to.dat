At times I was so enjoying listening to the others talking that I almost forgot that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> be taking part. It was a wide-ranging discussion taking in ants on stilts, pianists with crippling, mechanical little fingers, the changing meridian and okapi sex (can you guess what I contributed?). The show has a dedicated team of nerds behind it who have dug out amazing facts and I love {{the way it has}} a panel comprising comedians, scientists and experts and attempts to link each contribution to similar areas of the different disciplines. While most TV panel shows (including to some extent even QI) gravitate to putting in the same well-known comedy faces, you get a lot more interesting stuff by mixing it up a bit. The zoologist, Dr Christofer Clemente, came up with the funniest lines of the show. But would they book him on Mock The Week? It's intelligent and stimulating programming that is increasingly being edged out of TV and even radio, leaving a gaping open goal for independent internet productions to score in. I discussed this with one of the razor-minded team after the show. The TV companies insist on getting big names into all shows, which takes up all the budget and seems to ignore the fact that the pool of possible contributors gets smaller and more boring. But glad that a few shows designed to expand the mind rather than crush the spirit still exist." ...|$|E
500|$|Throughout {{her career}} Madonna has been {{involved}} in writing and producing most of her own music. Stuart Price, who worked on Confessions on a Dance Floor (2005), said that [...] "You don't produce Madonna, you collaborate with her. She's a really good producer herself and obviously a great writer too. She has her vision and knows how to get it." [...] Madonna's early songwriting skill was developed during her time with the Breakfast Club in 1979. According to author Carol Gnojewski, her first attempts at songwriting are perceived as an important self-revelation, as Madonna said: [...] "I don't know where [...] came from. It was like magic. I'd write a song every day. I said 'Wow, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> do this'." [...] Madonna later became the sole writer of five songs on her debut album, including [...] "Lucky Star" [...] which she composed on synthesizer. Rolling Stone has named her [...] "an exemplary songwriter with a gift for hooks and indelible lyrics." [...] According to Freya Jarman-Ivens, Madonna's talent for developing [...] "incredible" [...] hooks for her songs allows the lyrics to capture the attention of the audience, even without the influence of the music. As an example, Jarman-Ivens cites the 1985 single [...] "Into the Groove" [...] and its line [...] "Live out your fantasy here with me, just let the music set you free; Touch my body, and move in time, now I know you're mine." [...] Though Madonna has worked with producers across many genres, her songs have been consistently stamped with her own sensibility and inflected with autobiographical detail. Some of her lyrics contain innuendos and double entendre, which led to multiple interpretations among music critics and scholars. Madonna has been nominated for being inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame three times, for 2014, 2016 and 2017 ceremony. Rolling Stone listed Madonna at number 56 on the [...] "100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time".|$|E

2500|$|Mercy {{is one of}} four {{characters}} {{created by}} a team of 13 writers aged between 17 and 22 for the Internet spin-off series EastEnders: E20. The characters were created in August 2009 and open auditions were held for the cast at Theatre Royal Stratford East. Mojekwu's casting was announced on 25 November 2009, on which she commented: [...] "I feel so blessed to be part of EastEnders: E20. My first day on set was just crazy. I was on Albert Square—a dream come true—I'm enjoying every second." [...] When Mojekwu was asked in an interview with media website Digital Spy how she felt about being the only main cast member from EastEnders: E20 not appearing in EastEnders, she said: [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>meant</b> <b>to</b> go into the main show, then I would have done. Obviously I'd have loved to but for someone like my character, it'll be the support of the viewers that decide her fate. I don't feel upset or anything, I just thought that it's the way these things go." [...] It was announced on 24 January 2010 that Mercy would appear in EastEnders later in 2010. Executive producer Diederick Santer said that once he had seen the completed episodes of EastEnders: E20, he wanted Mercy in the main show as well, and stated: [...] "Mercy's also been a huge hit with E20 viewers—she's funny, warm, sensitive and rather mysterious. [...] I'm delighted Bunmi will be bringing those qualities to the wider EastEnders audience." [...] Mercy and her grandmother Grace's introduction to EastEnders made them the first Nigerian family to appear in the series. Mojekwu was surprised at how long it took the programme to represent her community in the series, but congratulated them for doing so, saying [...] "they {{have a long way to}} go in representing us." [...] Mercy's younger sister Faith Olubunmi was introduced in series 3 of E20.|$|E
