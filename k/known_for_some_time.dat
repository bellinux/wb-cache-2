By the time of Baird's collection in 1845, the West Virginia stations of the plant had been lost to science, and his Pennsylvania colony {{was the only one}} <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time.</b> Specimens of box huckleberry were subsequently identified in Delaware in 1870, by William M.

5|$|It {{has been}} <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> that St Kilda was {{continuously}} inhabited for two millennia or more, from the Bronze Age to the 20th century. Recently, the first direct evidence of earlier Neolithic settlement emerged—shards of pottery of the Hebridean ware style, found {{to the east}} of the village. The subsequent discovery of a quarry for stone tools on Mullach Sgar above Village Bay led to finds of numerous stone hoe-blades, grinders and Skaill knives in the Village Bay cleitean—unique stone storage buildings (see below). These tools are also probably of Neolithic origin.|$|E
5|$|The {{level of}} secrecy of the case, which was criticised by some {{contemporary}} observers, {{meant that it}} was not properly recorded or published, and the exact facts of the argument were not <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time.</b> As a result, whilst it sharply differs from later rulings such as Corbett v Corbett , it was not able to be considered as precedent in later judgments on the legal recognition of gender variance.|$|E

5|$|Further {{evidence}} {{for the existence of}} the Kuiper belt later emerged from the study of comets. That comets have finite lifespans has been <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time.</b> As they approach the Sun, its heat causes their volatile surfaces to sublimate into space, gradually dispersing them. In order for comets to continue to be visible over the age of the Solar System, they must be replenished frequently. One such area of replenishment is the Oort cloud, a spherical swarm of comets extending beyond 50,000 AU from the Sun first hypothesised by Dutch astronomer Jan Oort in 1950. The Oort cloud is thought to be the point of origin of long-period comets, which are those, like Hale–Bopp, with orbits lasting thousands of years.|$|E
5|$|A narrow quay passes {{under the}} old swivel section of the bridge from Waller's Quay to the marina. A well-worn {{handrail}} offers the pedestrian some protection against a slip into the river. This rail has been known as the Duke's Rail since in 1897 the then Duke of York, later to become George V, paid a state visit to Ireland. The royal party travelled up-river from Portumna on the steamship Countess of Mayo. Disembarking at Waller's Quay, the Duke was received by Lord Rosse, the Lord Lieutenant of King's County. The party had to traverse the narrow quay under the bridge to get to Banagher Railway Station, and undoubtedly made good use of the Duke's Rail. The stretch of the Shannon from Portumna to Banagher was <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> after as the Duke of York's Route.|$|E

25|$|Tito died on 4 May 1980 of {{complications}} from surgery. While it had been <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> that the 87-year-old president's health had been failing, his death nonetheless {{came as a shock}} to the country. This was because Tito was looked upon as the country's hero in World War II and had been the country's dominant figure and identity for over three decades. His loss marked a significant alteration, and it was reported that many Yugoslavs openly mourned his death. In the Split soccer stadium, Serbs and Croats visited the coffin among other spontaneous outpourings of grief, and a funeral was organized by the League of Communists.|$|E

The Brisbane Bandits is also a reintroduction of a team name from the original ABL that participated in all but the final season.|$|E
25|$|The {{third most}} {{abundant}} constituent of the Uranian atmosphere is methane , {{the presence of}} which has been <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> {{as a result of the}} ground-based spectroscopic observations. Methane possesses prominent absorption bands in the visible and near-infrared, making Uranus aquamarine or cyan in colour. Below the methane cloud deck at 1.3bar methane molecules account for about 2.3% of the atmosphere by molar fraction; about 10 to 30 times that found in the Sun. The mixing ratio is much lower in the upper atmosphere due to the extremely low temperature at the tropopause, which lowers the saturation level and causes excess methane to freeze out. Methane appears to be undersaturated in the upper troposphere above the clouds having a partial pressure of only 30% of the saturated vapor pressure there. The concentration of less volatile compounds such as ammonia, water and hydrogen sulfide in the deep atmosphere is poorly known. However, as with methane, their abundances are probably greater than solar values by a factor of at least 20 to 30, and possibly by a factor of a few hundred.|$|E

25|$|In 1399, {{the exiled}} Henry Bolingbroke, {{heir to the}} Duchy of Lancaster, {{returned}} to reclaim his lands. Henry raised an army and marched to meet the King. Richard hurried back from Ireland to Wales to deal with Bolingbroke but he was arrested by Henry Percy, 1st Earl of Northumberland, as {{he was on his}} way from Conwy Castle to meet Bolingbroke at Flint Castle supposedly to discuss the restitution of Henry's lands. Richard was imprisoned at Chester before being taken to London. Parliament quickly made Henry Bolingbroke Regent and then King. Richard died in Pontefract Castle, shortly after the failed Epiphany Rising of English nobles in January 1400, but his death was not generally <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time.</b> In Wales, people like Owain Glyndŵr were asked for the first time in their life to decide their loyalties. The Welsh had generally supported King Richard, who had succeeded his father, Edward, the Black Prince, as Prince of Wales. With Richard removed, the opportunities for advancement for Welsh people became more limited. Many Welsh people seem to have been uncertain where this left them and their future.|$|E

500|$|The first {{large-scale}} {{application of}} strontium {{was in the}} production of sugar from sugar beet. Although a crystallisation process using strontium hydroxide was patented by Augustin-Pierre Dubrunfaut in 1849 the large scale introduction came with the improvement of the process in the early 1870s. The German sugar industry used the process well into the 20th century. Before World War I the beet sugar industry used [...] 100,000 to 150,000 tons of strontium hydroxide for this process per year. The strontium hydroxide was recycled in the process, but the demand to substitute losses during production was high enough to create a significant demand initiating mining of strontianite in the Münsterland. The [...] mining of strontianite in Germany ended when mining of the celestine deposits in Gloucestershire started. These mines supplied most of the world strontium supply from 1884 to 1941. Although the celestine deposits in the Granada basin were <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> the large scale mining did not start before the 1950s.|$|E

Perrault senior, however, was <b>known</b> <b>for</b> <b>some</b> <b>time</b> to have been interested in contes de veille or contes de ma mère l'oye, and in 1693 published a versification of [...] "Les Souhaits Ridicules" [...] and, in 1694, a tale with a Cinderella theme called [...] "Peau d'Ane".
