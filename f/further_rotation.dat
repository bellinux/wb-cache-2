Microstructure {{and texture}} {{development}} in twinned fcc metals is investigated {{in order to}} characterize the influence of micro- and macro-scale brass-type shear bands (SB) on structural and textural changes at large deformations. TEM and SEM analyses are focused on bands developed by plane strain compression in twinned C{ 112 } oriented single crystals. The proposed crystallographic model of the shear banding phenomenon refers {{to the idea of}} local lattice re-orientation within narrow areas. Most of these rotations occur around the TD|| axis with significant <b>further</b> <b>rotations</b> about poles.

50|$|This {{rotation}} {{takes place}} in five steps. The amine group present on the triptycene moiety is converted to an isocyanate group by condensation with phosgene (a).

This reaction irreversibly traps {{the system as a}} strained cyclic urethane that is higher in energy and thus energetically closer to the rotational energy barrier than the original state. <b>Further</b> <b>rotation</b> of the triptycene moiety therefore requires only a relatively small amount of thermal activation in order to overcome this barrier, thereby releasing the strain (d).

50|$|Most systems {{include a}} brake {{to stop the}} wires from {{unravelling}} completely if a wire breaks or tension is lost.

The pulley can turn freely while the weights move up or down as the wires contract or expand. If tension is lost the pulley falls back toward the mast, and one of its teeth jams against the stop.

40|$|International audienceDespite the {{importance}} of the Pamir range in controlling Asian paleoenvironments and land-sea paleogeography, its tectonic evolution remains poorly constrained in time and space, hindering its potential for understanding deep to surface processes. We provide here new constraints on vertical-axis tectonic rotations from the southwest Tarim Basin along the eastern flank of the Pamir arcuate range based on paleomagnetic results. Two well-dated Eocene to Oligocene sections, previously analyzed using biostratigraphy andmagnetostratigraphy, yield consistently clockwise rotations of 21. 6 ± 4. 2 ° in 41 to 36 Ma strata then 17. 1 ± 6. 5 ° in 33 to 28 Ma strata at the Aertashi section and 14. 2 ± 11. 5 ° in 41 to 40 Ma strata at the Kezi section. Combined with a regional review of existing paleomagnetic studies, these results indicate that most of the clockwise rotations along the eastern Pamir occurred during Oligocene times and did not extend systematically and regionally into the TarimBasin. In contrast, on the western flank of the Pamir tectonic rotations in Cretaceous to Neogene strata are regionally extensive and systematically counterclockwise throughout the Afghan-Tajik Basin. This timing and pattern of rotations is consistent with paleogeographic reconstructions of the regional sea retreat out of Central Asia and supports a two-stage kinematic model: (1) symmetric rotations of either flanks of the Pamir arcuate range until Oligocene times followed by (2) continued rotations on its western flank associated with radial thrusting and, along the eastern flank, no <b>further</b> <b>rotations</b> due to decoupled transfer slip starting in the Early Miocene...|$|R

50|$|To ensure this {{rotation}} {{was complete}} and the latches {{were in the}} proper position, the DC-10 cargo hatch design included a separate locking mechanism that consisted of small locking pins that slid behind flanges on the lock torque tube (which transferred the actuator force to the latch hooks through a linkage). When the locking pins were in place, any rotation of the latches would cause the torque tube flanges to contact the locking pins, making <b>further</b> <b>rotation</b> impossible. The pins were pushed into place by an operating handle {{on the outside of}} the hatch. If the latches were not properly closed, the pins would strike the torque tube flanges and the handle would remain open, visually indicating a problem. Additionally, the handle moved a metal plug into a vent cut in the outer hatch panel. If the vent was not plugged, the fuselage would not retain pressure, eliminating any pneumatic force on the hatch. Also, there was an indicator light in the cockpit, controlled by a switch actuated by the locking pin mechanism, that remained lit unless the cargo hatch was correctly latched.|$|E
50|$|The arched, non-cutting top of {{the blade}} is called the back or the spine while the cutting part of the blade {{opposite}} the back is called the cutting edge. Finally the other free end of the blade, {{at the opposite end}} of the tang, is called the point and, sometimes, the head or the nose.There are usually two, but sometimes three, pins in the handle. The middle pin, if present, is plastic coated and is called the centre plug. Its function is to stabilise the sides of the handle so that they cannot be squeezed in the middle and acts as a bridge between them. When folded into the scales, the blade is protected from accidental damage, and the user is protected from accidental injury. During folding, the back of the blade, being thick and normally with a curved cross-section, acts as a natural stopper and prevents <b>further</b> <b>rotation</b> of the blade out of the handle from the other side. The frictional force between the scales and the tang applied about the pivot is called the Tension and it determines how freely the blade rotates about the point of rotation. A proper amount of tension should be present, for safety reasons, to ensure that the blade does not spin freely when opening or closing.|$|E

For this purpose a rudder of the following construction may be adopted:—Vanes or movable surfaces are attached to arms projecting from the vessel laterally or at right angles to its length.
