40|$|This {{problem is}} {{motivated}} {{by the use of}} crystals as detectors of energetic charged particles that pass completely through the crystal, leaving a trail of electron-ion pairs. Although the crystals are nominally insulators, the electrons so liberated are in the conduction band and can be separated from the ion by a DC electric field, resulting in a signal pulse on the electrodes plated onto opposite faces of the crystal. 1, 2, 3 However, recombination of the drifting electrons at impurity sites is an issue, and it was eventually realized that the high purities of germanium and silicon required for successful transistors are also good for crystalline particle detectors. 4 In addition, p-n diode junctions proved to be suitable for particle detectors [10]. A typical silicon p-n junction is illustrated below, in which a potential difference ΔV ≈ 0. 8 V develops across the junction {{in the absence of an}} external bias voltage, 5 due to the layers of (space) charge, a few μm thick. The p-side of the junction is doped with a bulk number density Np (or Na) of atoms (such as boron) with 3 valence electrons (compared to 4 for Si), called acceptors in that these atoms can accept electrons from neighboring atoms, the motion of which electrons in one direction corresponds to a current of (electrically positive) holes in the other. The n-side is doped with number density Nn (or Nd) of atoms with 5 valence electrons (such as phosphorus), called donors. 6 A electron current can flow from the n-side to the p-side only if an external (forward) bias voltage Vp − Vn> ΔV is applied, and no (significant) electron current flows from the p-side to the n-side for any applied voltage less than this. The p-n junction acts as a diode/rectifier. Doped silicon has “free ” charge carriers, predominantly holes in p-doping and predominantly electrons in n-doping. As such, the can be no electric field inside the doped silicon 1 Crystals with metallic electrodes are metal-semiconductor junctions, first investigated by Braun in 1874 [1].

The resulting estimated breakdown field of 3 C-SiC is at least twice the breakdown field of silicon, but is only around half the breakdown field of 4 H-SiC for the doping range studied.

40|$|Dendritic excitability is {{modulated}} by {{the highly}} variable {{spatial and temporal}} expression pattern of voltage-dependent potassium channels. Somatodendritic Kv 2. 1 channels contribute {{a major component of}} delayed rectifier potassium current in cultured hippocampal neurons, where Kv 2. 1 is localized to large clusters on the soma and proximal dendrites. Here we found that dramatic differences exist in the clustering of endogenous Kv 2. 1 in cultured rat hippocampal GABAergic interneurons and glutamatergic pyramidal neurons, Studies on neurons developing in culture revealed that while a similar sequence of Kv 2. 1 localization and clustering occurred in both cell types. the process was temporally delayed in pyramidal cells. Localization and clustering of recombinant green fluorescent protein-tagged Kv 2. 1 occurred by the same sequence of events. and imaging of GFP-Kv 2. 1 clustering in living neurons revealed dynamic fusion events that underlie cluster formation. Overexpression of GFP- Kv 2. 1 accelerated the clustering program in pyramidal neurons such that the observed differences in Kv 2. 1 clustering in pyramidal neurons and interneurons were eliminated. Confocal imaging showed a preferential association of Kv 2. 1 with the basal membrane in cultured neurons, and electrophysiological recordings front neurons cultured on transistors revealed that Kv 2. 1 contributed the bulk of a previously described adherens <b>junction</b> delayed <b>rectifier</b> potassium conductance. Finally, Kv 2. 1 clusters were found spatially associated with ryanodine receptor intracellular Ca 2 + ([Ca 2 +](i)) release channels. These findings reveal a stepwise assembly of Kv 2. 1 potassium channels into membrane clusters during development, and an association of these clusters with Ca 2 +, signaling apparatus. Together these data suggest that the: restricted localization of Kv 2. 1 may {{play an important role in}} the previously observed contribution of this potassium channel in regulating dendritic [Ca 2 +](i) transients.

40|$|Langmuir-Blodgett monolayers of a {{bistable}} [2]rotaxane {{were prepared}} at packing densities of 118, 73, and 54 Å 2 /molecule. The monolayers were both characterized via infrared spectroscopy {{before and after}} evaporation of a 2 nm film of titanium and incorporated into molecular switch tunnel junction devices. The study suggests that the evaporation process primarily affects portions of the molecule exposed to the metal atom source. Thus, in tightly packed monolayers (73 and 54 Å 2 /molecule), only the portions of the [2]rotaxane that are present at the molecule/air interface are clearly affected, leaving key functionality necessary for switching intact. Monolayers transferred at a lower pressure (118 Å 2 /molecule) exhibit nonspecific damage and poor switching behavior following Ti deposition. These results indicate that tightly packed monolayers and sacrificial functionality displayed at the molecule/air interface are important design principles for molecular electronic devices. A common approach for making molecular electronic devices, such as molecular switch tunnel <b>junctions</b> (MSTJs) or <b>rectifiers,</b> is to sandwich a molecular film between two electrodes.

40|$|The use {{of genetic}} {{engineering}} of unexcitable cells to enable expression of gap <b>junctions</b> and inward <b>rectifier</b> potassium channels has suggested that cell therapies aimed at establishing electrical coupling of unexcitable donor cells to host cardiomyocytes may be arrhythmogenic. Whether similar considerations apply when the donor cells are electrically excitable has not been investigated. Here we tested the hypothesis that adenoviral transfer of genes coding Kir 2. 1 (I(K 1)), Na(V) 1. 5 (I(Na)) and connexin- 43 (Cx 43) proteins into neonatal rat ventricular myofibroblasts (NRVF) will convert them into fully excitable cells, rescue rapid conduction velocity (CV) and {{reduce the incidence of}} complex reentry arrhythmias in an in vitro model. We used adenoviral (Ad-) constructs encoding Kir 2. 1, Na(V) 1. 5 and Cx 43 in NRVF. In single NRVF, Ad-Kir 2. 1 or Ad-Na(V) 1. 5 infection enabled us to regulate the densities of I(K 1) and I(Na), respectively. At varying MOI ratios of 10 / 10, 5 / 10 and 5 / 20, NRVF co-infected with Ad-Kir 2. 1 + Na(V) 1. 5 were hyperpolarized and generated action potentials (APs) with upstroke velocities > 100 V/s. However, when forming monolayers only the addition of Ad-Cx 43 made the excitable NRVF capable of conducting electrical impulses (CV =  20. 71 ± 0. 79 cm/s). When genetically engineered excitable NRVF overexpressing Kir 2. 1, Na(V) 1. 5 and Cx 43 were used to replace normal NRVF in heterocellular monolayers that included neonatal rat ventricular myocytes (NRVM), CV was significantly increased (27. 59 ± 0. 76 cm/s vs. 21. 18 ± 0. 65 cm/s, p< 0. 05), reaching values similar to those of pure myocytes monolayers (27. 27 ± 0. 72 cm/s). Moreover, during reentry, propagation was faster and more organized, with a significantly lower number of wavebreaks in heterocellular monolayers formed by excitable compared with unexcitable NRVF. Viral transfer of genes coding Kir 2. 1, Na(V) 1. 5 and Cx 43 to cardiac myofibroblasts endows them with the ability to generate and propagate APs. The results provide proof of concept that cell therapies with excitable donor cells increase safety and reduce arrhythmogenic potential...|$|R
40|$|To better {{understand}} the process of miniaturization and the behavior of molecular structures under this effect we appeal to the calculations based in Quantum Mechanics (QM) with the purpose to corroborate theoretical and experimental data as electronic structure as well as electric properties. Another method sufficiently known consists simulate solute-solvent effect through the probabilistic Monte Carlo (MC) method. Of ownership of these computational tools we develop simulations QM/MC that translate the behavior of organic composites Methyl Red (MR) and 1, 4 -bis (5 -phenyl- 2 -oxazolyl) benzene (POPOP), when suffer structural changes, modification in the optic answers, etc., due miniaturization processes, environment variations, external actions. The Methyl Red composite {{is known as a}} sensible dye of pH variation and meets in the basic and acid (isoeletrônico, zwitteriônico) forms is classified as azo-composite for the presence of (– N = N –) bonding in its structure. The POPOP is a luminescent dye of intense fluorescence in the blue region of the UV-Visible spectrum; we stand out that to investigate the functional and mannering principles of this structure we consider two conformational structures protonated derivatives of POPOP: C 1 (N+) and C 2 (N+). Initially all organic composites structures of MR and POPOP had been optimized through of the quantum methods: semiempirical PM 3 (Parametric Method 3) and ab initio HF (Hartree-Fock) and DFT (Density Functional Theory), getting the geometric parameters and the conformations of lowest energy of each system, {{for the study of the}} electronic structure. Sequentially, two distinct stages of simulation had been used for the study of composites: 1 st) The MR and POPOP structures had been optimized through the method PM 3 + External Electric Field (the EEC), getting the geometric parameters and charge parameters. We use this method with the purpose to simulate the electronic transport properties of organic composites as the electric reply characterized by the charge transport (e) curve in function of the variation of the tension (V) in the structures. By means of the electric reply [(e) × V] we characterize this function to use them in nanostructured devices, as photodiodes, photodetector, solar cells, etc. The 2 nd stage consists of simulate organic composites through the Monte Carlo method, to investigate its behaviors in liquid. The systems distinct consist of the addition of VM (basic, acid: isoelectronic and zwitterionic) and POPOP [C 1 (N+) and C 2 (N+) ] in 1000 water molecules to analyze the solute-solvent interactions for development of interchange systems optoelectronic systems as sensory. In MC simulation had been carried 1 × 1010 steps MC for both thermalization and equilibrium stages in NVT ensemble. Generate a set of 105 configurations, from these we select a set reduced of 103 descorrelantion configurations of which we obtain the convergence average of the electronic transitions π→π*. The convergence average of the electronic transitions π→π* for MR: basic s of 434. 33 ± 1, 0 [436, 34 ± 2, 0 nm], isoelectronic 485, 80 nm ± 2, 0 nm [480, 66 nm ± 3, 0 nm], and zwitterionic [502. 13 nm ± 3. 0 nm]; for POPOP C 1 [361, 25 nm ± 2, 0 nm], C 1 (NP+P) [485. 0 ± 26. 0 nm], C 2 [355, 39 nm ± 3, 0 nm] and C 2 (NP+P) [472. 0 ± 24. 0 nm]. The averages of the electronic transitions π→π* had been obtained through semiempirical ZINDO/S-CIS (Zerner Intermediate Neglect of Orbital Diffential Spectroscopic - Configurations Interaction, Single excitation) method that better translates the spectroscopic parameters of the organic molecules in the UV-visible region. Experimentally we develop two distinct types of systems through of the techniques: Sol-Gel that consists in the incorporation of composites in host matrix of APP (Aluminum Polyphosphate), and Blendes that consist in the manufacture of volume devices within active monolayer. The MR and POPOP composites had been diluted in hybrid solution (10 % etanol + 90 % water), aliquots of these solutions had been incorporated in the synthesis of APP/Gel. The samples obtain for the Sol-Gel process had been submitted to the variation pH and characterized by spectroscopy of absorption in the UV-Visible region, whose bands of maximum absorption are of [431 nm, 513 nm, 511 nm] for MR and [358 nm, 511 nm and 472 nm] for POPOP and values of [355 nm, 361 nm] for POPOP in solution, that corroborate the theoretical results from the averages of the electronic transitions π→π*. The monolayer devices of MR and POPOP had been manufactured by overlapped of thin films in vitreous substrate/FTO (1 st electrode) /PEDOT/P 3 HT/ active monolayer -Aluminum (2 nd electrode) and characterized electrically for charge density (J) in function of applied voltage (V), under dark current and under 550 nm monochromatic light. The MR devices present curve (J×V) characteristic of a <b>rectifier</b> <b>junction</b> p-n of higher electric current signal under reverse polarization for dark current, being this signal intensified under light 550 nm; under forward bias the device presents the same behavior how much to the current signal, this is intensified when measured on monochromatic light (550 nm) in comparison with dark current, however under reverse polarization and forward bias the device presents curve characteristic (J×V) analogous of the conventional photodetector and diode tunnel. For POPOP intensification of the electric chain signal is observed under forward bias and reverses when the devices are under monochromatic light in comparison with measures made under dark current, in way that the characteristic curve (J×V) has similar behavior of the conventional photodiodes. The theoretical-experimental results of the electric (J×V) properties of composites had presented similar behaviors in the voltage range [- 2. 0 V – 2. 97 V] for MR and [- 2. 86 V - 2. 86 V] for POPOP. We development a complete study with polymers of low bandgap (gap 1 eV) based in monomers bridges composition for carbon forming polymeric chains had been investigated by the methods AM 1 (Austin Model 1), PM 3 and DFT [B 3 LYP/ 6 - 31 G] to corroborated the results of the oligomers of CDM (4 -dicyano methyllene- 4 H-cyclopente [2. 1 - 3 : 4 -b'] dithiophene) and BDT (1, 3 -benzodithiole- 4 H-cyclopenta [2, 1 -b: 3, 4 -b'] dithiophene), derived from the ditiophene. The results show that the growth of the polymeric chain formed by monomers of CDM and BDT provokes the reduction bandgap of the oligomers, analogous behavior to the polymers based on (3 -alkylthiophenes) whose electronic transition π→π* energy is of 1. 67 eV, the maximum absorption of the CDM and BDT are of 1. 28 eV and 1, 73 eV, respectively The theoretical methods used in this study to describe satisfactorily this behavior, whose maximum absorption is of approximately 1, 28 eV for CDM and 1, 74 eV for BDT, these results had been obtain from the polymeric chains formed by 5 monomers units, demonstrating that the geometric conformations of the polymeric chains simulated are equiprobability, proving the trustworthiness of the methods used in our investigation. In general lines, the results presents to demonstrate that the organic composites investigated are good candidates for employ in nanostructured organic devices applied in the molecular electronics and new technology of materials.
