40|$|A new drying-free {{colloidal}} casting {{method was}} developed for shape forming of ceramics with controllable microstructure. A polymerizable solvent such as furfuryl alcohol (FA) was employed to disperse ceramic particles to form a colloidal ceramic suspension with good fluidity. After casting, the solvent was polymerized into a polymer, resulting in solidification of the colloidal suspension. For the purpose of demonstrating this casting method, three types of ceramic powders (NiO/YSZ, Al(2) O(3) and YSZ) were used to fabricate a NiO/YSZ ceramic tube, an Al(2) O(3) ceramic part with a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>screw</b> nut shape, and a YSZ thin film. Our study shows that the microstructure (pore size and porosity) of ceramics can be readily tuned by adjusting the amount of FA, and the drying-free casting method offers better controllability over the shape forming {{of a wide variety}} of ceramic material...|$|E
40|$|The study {{analyses}} the short- {{and long-term}} clinical results in 112 patients with total or partial edentulia of the jaw undergoing oral implantology {{in order to}} assess the type of surgical complications. A total of 327 implants were inserted with an internal <b>hexagonal</b> <b>screw,</b> a diameter of between 3. 25 and 5. 5 mm and between 11 and 15 mm long. Each patient received three types of implant: overdentures, bridges supported by implants alone and bridges supported by implants and natural teeth. In line with other data reported in the literature, the failure rate at 7 years was 3 %. After a general discussion of the possible surgical complications arising during implantology, the authors describe and analyse all the surgical complications that occurred in this series, regarding both implants alone, bridges supported by implants and natural teeth...|$|E
40|$|Self-tapping of {{magnesium}} screws in hard bone {{may be a}} challenge due to the limited torsional strength {{of magnesium}} alloys in comparison with titanium. To avoid screw failure upon implantation, the new concept of a rivet-screw was applied to a WE 43 magnesium alloy. Hollow cylinders with threads on the outside were expanded inside drill holes of minipig mandibles. During the expansion with a hexagonal mandrel, the threads engaged the surrounding bone and {{the inside of the}} screw transformed into a <b>hexagonal</b> <b>screw</b> drive to allow further screwing in or out of the implant. The in vivo degradation of the magnesium implants and the performance of the used coating were studied in a human standard-sized animal model. Four magnesium alloy rivet-screws were implanted in each mandible of 12 minipigs. Six animals received the plasmaelectrolytically coated magnesium alloy implants; another six received the uncoated magnesium alloy rivet-screws. Two further animals received one titanium rivet-screw each as control. In vivo radiologic examination was performed at one, four, and eight weeks. Euthanasia was performed for one group of seven animals (three animals with coated, three with uncoated magnesium alloy implants and one with titanium implant) at 12 weeks and for the remaining seven animals at 24 weeks. After euthanasia, micro-computed tomography and histological examination with histomorphometry were performed. Significantly less void formation as well as higher bone volume density (BV/TV) and bone-implant contact area (BIC) were measured around the coated implants compared to the uncoated ones. The surface coating was effective in delaying degradation despite plastic deformation. The results showed potential for further development of magnesium hollow coated screws for bone fixation...|$|E
40|$|Misfit at the abutment-prosthetic {{cylinder}} interface {{can cause}} loss of preload, leading to loosening or fracture {{of gold and}} titanium screws. OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the influence of screw type, alloy, and cylinder position on marginal fit of implant frameworks before and after laser welding. METHODS: After Estheticone-like abutments were screwed to the implants, thirty plastic prosthetic cylinders were mounted and waxed-up to fifteen cylindrical bars. Each specimen had three interconnected prosthetic components. Five specimens were one-piece cast in titanium and five in cobalt-chromium alloy. On each specimen, tests were conducted with hexagonal titanium and slotted gold screws separately, performing a total of thirty tested screws. Measurements at the interfaces were performed using an optical microscope with 5 mm accuracy. After sectioning, specimens were laser welded and new measurements were obtained. Data were submitted to a four-way ANOVA and Tukey's multiple comparisons test (alpha= 0. 05). RESULTS: Slotted and <b>hexagonal</b> <b>screws</b> did not present significant differences regarding to the fit of cylinders cast in titanium, either in one-piece casting framework or after laser welding. When slotted and <b>hexagonal</b> <b>screws</b> were tested on the cobalt-chromium specimens, statistically {{significant differences were found}} for the one-piece casting condition, with the slotted screws presenting better fit (24. 13 µm) than the <b>hexagonal</b> <b>screws</b> (27. 93 µm). Besides, no statistically significant differences were found after laser welding. CONCLUSIONS: 1) The use of different metal alloys do exert influence on the marginal fit, 2) The slotted and <b>hexagonal</b> <b>screws</b> play the exclusive role of fixing the prosthesis, and did not improve the fit of cylinders, and 3) cylinder position did not affect marginal fit values...|$|R

40|$|In this Master of Science thesis screws with {{different}} coatings {{were exposed to}} an accelerated corrosion test in order to investigate the corrosion development. The test matrix constituted of <b>hexagonal</b> and flange <b>screws</b> (fastened on frames) coated with either zinc/iron (ZnFe) or a flake system of aluminum and zinc (GEOMET). The corrosion results were analyzed by means of X-ray diffraction (XRD). In this study the screws were also crosscut and analyzed by means of FEG-SEM {{in order to determine}} the thickness and the elemental content of the surface coating. The result of the corrosion test showed that the screws coated with GEOMET showed a very good corrosion resistance whilst the screws coated with ZnFe failed to fulfill the demands on corrosion resistance of Scania...|$|R
40|$|We {{have grown}} {{epitaxial}} Rhenium (Re) (0001) films on α-Al 2 O 3 (0001) substrates using sputter deposition in an ultra high vacuum system. We find that better epitaxy is achieved with DC {{rather than with}} RF sputtering. With DC sputtering, epitaxy is obtained with the substrate temperatures above 700 °C and deposition rates below 1 Å/s. The epitaxial Re films are typically composed of terraced <b>hexagonal</b> islands with <b>screw</b> dislocations, and island size gets larger with high temperature post-deposition annealing. The growth starts in a three dimensional mode but transforms into two dimensional mode as the film gets thicker. With a thin (~ 2 nm) seed layer deposited at room temperature and annealed at a high temperature, the initial three dimensional growth can be suppressed. This results in larger islands when a thick film is grown at 850 °C on the seed layer. We also find that when a room temperature deposited Re film is annealed to higher temperatures, epitaxial features start to show up above ~ 600 °C, but the film tends to be disordered...|$|R
40|$|We {{report a}} void defect in gallium nitride (GaN) and InGaN, {{revealed}} by aberration-corrected scanning {{transmission electron microscopy}} (STEM). The voids are pyramids with symmetric hexagonal { 0001 } base facets and { 101 ¯ 1 } side facets. Each pyramid void has a dislocation {{at the peak of the}} pyramid, which continues up along the [0001] growth direction to the surface. Some of the dislocations are <b>hexagonal</b> open core <b>screw</b> dislocations with { 101 ¯ 0 } side facets, varying lateral widths, and varying degrees of hexagonal symmetry. STEM electron energy loss spectroscopy spectrum imaging showed a large C concentration inside the void and on the void surfaces. There is also a larger C concentration in the GaN (or InGaN) below the void than above the void. We propose that inadvertent carbon deposition during metal organic chemical vapor deposition growth acts as a mask, stopping the GaN deposition locally, which in combination with lateral overgrowth, creates a void. Subsequent layers of GaN deposited around the C covered region create the overhanging { 101 ¯ 1 } facets, and the meeting of the six { 101 ¯ 1 } facets at the pyramid’s peak is not perfect, resulting in a dislocation...|$|R
30|$|A single-tooth osseointegrated implant is {{composed}} of an implant body, an abutment, an abutment screw, and an artificial crown. The implant and abutment are typically connected by an abutment screw. The degree of mechanical integrity at the implant-abutment interface depends on screw preload, abutment connection design, the fitness of all components, and dynamic loading conditions. Fractures of the internal or external connection between implants and implant abutments or abutment screws are encountered in the clinical setting [1 – 3]. Fractures may occur {{as a result of}} excessive axial forces (bending moments), horizontal loading, or rotational torque during functional activities such as chewing or parafunctional activities such as grinding and clenching. Several studies [4, 5] have evaluated implant-abutment assemblies in dynamic cyclic fatigue testing according to ISO 14801 [6]. However, evaluation of the strength of the implant-abutment assembly has not been reported when subjected to torsion testing. Test methods and standard vales have not yet been established for such torsion testing of implant-abutment assemblies. Abutment connections are principally classified as either internal or external types and are available in a variety of designs, including <b>hexagonal,</b> octagonal, cone <b>screw,</b> cone hex, cylinder hex, spline, cam, cam tube, and pin/slot. Implants incorporate features for rotation-prevention at the implant-abutment interface. The advantages and disadvantages of various types of implant-abutment connections have been discussed in several studies [7 – 11]. Norton reported that internal implant-abutment interface connections have higher bending moment resistance than external connections [10]. Presently, although more than 200 kinds of implant systems are available on the market, most manufacturers do not provide specific data regarding system-specific implant-abutment connection design complications [12, 13]. In the oral cavity, implant restorations are exposed to vertical, horizontal, and rotational forces during chewing. The maximum torsional strength and proportional limited strength on crown and tooth restoration materials were measured, and the values were compared with a mechanical bending and pull test value [14].|$|R
