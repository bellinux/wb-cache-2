5|$|The war policy 1547–1549 had entailed an <b>extraordinary</b> <b>expenditure</b> {{of about}} £350,000p.a. against a regular Crown income of £150,000p.a. It was {{impossible}} to continue in this way, and Dudley quickly negotiated a withdrawal of the besieged English garrison at Boulogne. The high costs of the garrison could thus be saved and French payments of redemption of roughly £180,000 were a most welcome cash income. The peace with France was concluded in the Treaty of Boulogne in March 1550. There was both public rejoicing and anger at the time, and some historians have condemned the peace as a shameful surrender of English-held territory.

6000|$|By {{this time}} The Bostonians was {{beginning}} to appear in an American magazine, and a little later, again at Dover, The Princess Casamassima was finished. For two years Henry James now wrote nothing but shorter pieces (among them The Aspern Papers, The Lesson of the Master, The Reverberator,) with growing disconcertment as he found how tardily they seemed to appeal to editors, American or English. In the autumn of 1885 he spent his accustomed month in Paris, after which he scarcely stirred from London for another year. Early in 1886 he at last accomplished a move from his Bolton Street lodging, never a very cheerful or convenient abode, to a flat in Kensington (13 De Vere Mansions, presently known as 34 De Vere Gardens), close to the palace and the park, where he had much more agreeable conditions of light and air and quiet. He was planning, however, for another long absence in Italy, away from the interruptions of London, and this he secured during the first seven months of 1887. For {{most of the time}} he was at Florence, where he took rooms in a villa overhanging the view from Bellosguardo; and he paid two lengthy visits to Venice, staying first with Mrs. Bronson, in the apartment so often occupied by Browning, and later with Mr. and Mrs. Daniel Curtis in the splendid old Palazzo Barbaro, where years afterwards he placed the exquisite and stricken heroine of The Wings of the Dove, for the climax of her story. He returned to England, late in the summer, to settle down to the writing of The Tragic Muse--the first time, as he mentions, that he had attacked a purely English subject on a large scale. [...] "I am getting to know English life better than American," [...] he writes in September 1888, when he was still working upon the book, [...] " ...and to understand the English character, or at least the mind, as well as if I had invented it--which indeed," [...] he adds lightly, [...] "I think I could have done without any very <b>extraordinary</b> <b>expenditure</b> of ingenuity." [...] The end of the summer of 1888 was spent in an hotel at Torquay, which became one of his favourite retreats; and later in the autumn he was for a short while abroad, at Geneva and Paris, with a flying dip into Northern Italy. The letter to his brother, written from Geneva, with which this section closes, lucidly sums up the conclusions he had by now drawn from the experience of a dozen years of England. At the age of forty-five he could feel that he had exhausted the study of the old international distinctions, English and American, that had engaged him for so long. He was indeed to return to them again, later on, and to devote to them the final elaboration of his art; but that lay far ahead, and now for many years he faced in other directions.|$|E
60|$|One word {{respecting}} Turner's {{more violent}} storms, for we have hitherto been speaking {{only of the}} softer rain-clouds, associated with gusty tempest, but not of the thunder-cloud and the whirlwind. If there be any one point in which engravers disgrace themselves more than in another, {{it is in their}} rendering of dark and furious storm. It appears to be utterly impossible to force it into their heads, that an artist does not leave his color with a sharp edge and an angular form by accident, or that they may have the pleasure of altering it and improving upon it; and equally impossible to persuade them that energy and gloom may in some circumstances be arrived at without any <b>extraordinary</b> <b>expenditure</b> of ink. I am aware of no engraver of the present day whose ideas of a storm-cloud are not comprised under two heads, roundness and blackness; and, indeed, their general principles of translation (as may be distinctly gathered from their larger works) are the following: 1. Where the drawing is gray, make the paper black. 2. Where the drawing is white, cover the page with zigzag lines. 3. Where the drawing has particularly tender tones, cross-hatch them. 4. Where any outline is particularly angular, make it round. 5. Where there are vertical reflections in water, express them with very distinct horizontal lines. 6. Where there is a passage of particular simplicity, treat it in sections. 7. Where there is anything intentionally concealed, make it out. Yet, in spite of the necessity which all engravers impose upon themselves, of rigidly observing this code of general laws, it is difficult to conceive how such pieces of work, as the plates of Stonehenge and Winchelsea, can ever have been presented to the public, as in any way resembling, or possessing even the most fanciful relation to the Turner drawings of the same subjects. The original of the Stonehenge is perhaps the standard of storm-drawing, both for the overwhelming power and gigantic proportions and spaces of its cloud-forms, and for the tremendous qualities of lurid and sulphurous colors which are gained in them. All its forms are marked with violent angles, as if the whole muscular energy--so to speak--of the cloud, were writhing in every fold, and their fantastic and fiery volumes have a peculiar horror--an awful life--shadowed out in their strange, swift, fearful outlines, which oppress the mind more than even the threatening of their gigantic gloom. The white lightning, not as it is drawn by less observant or less capable painters, in zigzag fortifications, but in its own dreadful irregularity of streaming fire, is brought down, not merely over the dark clouds, but through the full light of an illumined opening to the blue, which yet cannot abate the brilliancy of its white line; and the track of the last flash along the ground is fearfully marked by the dog howling over the fallen shepherd, and the ewe pressing her head upon the body of her dead lamb.|$|E

Parliament was also used for passing laws. 438 laws were passed under Elizabeth’s reign. They were either public, in which case they applied to all, or private, in which case they only applied to certain people. Only another Parliament could undo one. They required approval by both houses thrice and the queen. However, the queen could make Royal Proclamations without Parliament’s consent. Another purpose of Parliament was to advise.

40|$|Abstract: As this Summit {{addresses}} {{the value of}} the school of dentistry to its parent institution, clearly this value cannot be assessed by cost alone. However, as <b>extraordinary</b> <b>expenditures</b> are required to meet infrastructure and equipment needs of the school, the need for change is inevitable. As long as we continue {{to think in terms of}} the traditional four-year curriculum with its heavy staffing requirements to deliver information, and in terms of clinical practice programs conducted for the most part in-house, there is little opportunity to better manage the cost of dental education. Alternatives are discussed based on revenue and expense analyses from the most recently published financial statistics for dental education from both the American Dental Association and American Association of Dental Schools. Strategies are presented as either changes in the first two years of the predoctoral program or changes in the clinical component of the predoctoral program, with emphasis placed on partnerships with other dental schools and with organized dentistry, as suggested by Machen. It is concluded from a review of previous studies that approaching the task of reducing the cost of dental education within paradigms that allow for only marginal changes would be an exercise in micro-management and could be accomplished by simply rearranging what had been written. By extending our thoughts beyond the limitations of the traditional four-year curriculum, we have attempted to present strategies that could potentially have a significant effect upon the cost of academic dentistry. This summit {{addresses the}} value of the school ofdentistry to its parent institution.

40|$|This study aims {{to examine}} whether work status is the only basis for {{determining}} the provision of disability pensions in cases of mental illness, and considers the validity of this criterion and {{ways to improve the}} system. We collected 178 decisions of the Examination Committee of Social Insurance due to "Mental Illness" over a period of 11 years (1994 to 2004), and investigated the relationships among three factors : activity of daily living (ADL), work status, and pension benefits. We also examined the 21 working subjects separately. We found a significant relationship between ADL and pension benefits and between work status and pension benefits. No significant relationship was found between ADL and work status. In 6 of the 21 working subjects, the disability pension decision was made solely by focusing on work status. Despite this focus on work status, the working disabled cannot always compensate for their reduced income and the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>expenditure</b> incurred due to their disability. Further, because these decisions can go against the trend of encouraging the disabled to work, we suggest that it is not appropriate to focus solely on work status in determining pension benefits and propose ways to improve the system...|$|E
40|$|Microfinance has attracted, {{since its}} {{inception}} {{at the end of}} the seventies, the attention of many people and institutions, both at academic and donor levels. However, evidence is mixed so far and no definitive conclusion has yet emerged with respect to the positive effects of microfinance, in part because of the great differences among the different microfinance schemes but also because of methodological issues. This work aims to add some further evidence to the impact debate, with three studies in two different rural areas from Bangladesh and India. The first study is based on the second round of a survey in Bangladesh undertaken by the World Bank. A Propensity Score Matching approach was chosen to study the impact of borrowing on household income and expenditures per capita. In this case positive impact can only be seen in <b>extraordinary</b> <b>expenditures,</b> in particular in house extensions and investments in houses and land, but not in current expenditures or food expenditures. The second and third studies analyse a dataset collected in five districts of Andhra Pradesh, India. The former tries to answer the question of whether borrowing from Self- Help groups (SHGs) has any effect on income and income per capita at household level. Pooled ordinary least squares and difference in differences approaches are used to that end. A significant impact is found in this study on income and income per capita. In the last empirical work the main interest is focused on the distributional impact, on the understanding that anti-poverty measures should be focused on households at the bottom tail of income and income per capita distributions. Its analysis is based on quantile regression, with cross sectional and panel data approaches.

60|$|This {{leads to}} the vexed {{question}} to which Dr. Chalmers has very particularly adverted: whether the funds required by a government for <b>extraordinary</b> unproductive <b>expenditure</b> are best raised by loans, the interest only being provided by taxes, or whether taxes should be at once laid on to the whole amount; which is called, in the financial vocabulary, raising {{the whole of the}} supplies within the year. Dr. Chalmers is strongly for the latter method. He says the common notion is that, in calling for the whole amount in one year, you require what is either impossible, or very inconvenient; that the people can not, without great hardship, pay the whole at once out of their yearly income; and that it is much better to require of them a small payment every year in the shape of interest, than so great a sacrifice once for all. To which his answer is, that the sacrifice is made equally in either case. Whatever is spent can not but be drawn from yearly income. The whole and every part of the wealth produced in the country forms, or helps to form, the yearly income of somebody. The privation which it is supposed must result from taking the amount in the shape of taxes is not avoided by taking it in a loan. The suffering is not averted, but only thrown upon the laboring-classes, the least able, and who least ought, to bear it: while all the inconveniences, physical, moral, and political, produced by maintaining taxes for the perpetual payment of the interest, are incurred in pure loss. Whenever capital is withdrawn from production, or from the fund destined for production, to be lent to the state and expended unproductively, that whole sum is withheld from the laboring-classes: the loan, therefore, is in truth paid off the same year; the whole of the sacrifice necessary for paying it off is actually made: only it is paid to the wrong persons, and therefore does not extinguish the claim; and paid by the very worst of taxes, a tax exclusively on the laboring-class. And, after having, in this most painful and unjust of ways, gone through the whole effort necessary for extinguishing the debt, the country remains charged with it, and with the payment of its interest in perpetuity.|$|R
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The European State Finance Database (ESFD) is an international collaborative research project for the collection of data in European fiscal history. There are no strict geographical or chronological boundaries to the collection, although data for this collection comprise the period between c. 1200 to c. 1815. The purpose of the ESFD was to establish a significant database of European financial and fiscal records. The data are drawn from the main extant sources {{of a number of}} European countries, as the evidence and the state of scholarship permit. The aim was to collect the data made available by scholars, whether drawing upon their published or unpublished archival research, or from other published material. The ESFD project at the University of Leicester serves also to assist scholars working with the data by providing statistical manipulations of data and high quality graphical outputs for publication. The broad aim of the project was to act as a facilitator for a general methodological and statistical advance in the area of European fiscal history, with data capture and the interpretation of data in key publications as the measurable indicators of that advance. The data were originally deposited at the UK Data Archive in SAS transport format and as ASCII files; however, data files in this new edition have been saved as tab delimited files. Furthermore, this new edition features documentation {{in the form of a}} single file containing essential data file metadata, source details and notes of interest for particular files. Main Topics : The files in this dataset relate to the derived datafiles held in the Leicester database in the directory /rjb/malet/*. *.

40|$|Stroke is {{the most}} {{frequent}} cause of acquired impediment at the adult's age. The number of patients who are met by a stroke urgently or suffer from the chronic results will continuously rise during the next years {{on account of the}} changed age distribution. Equally the costs of this patient's group will also rise in Germany. Hence, the stroke prevention should be formulated as an important health-political aim. The stroke is caused either by an intrazerebrale bleeding (hemorrhegic stroke) or a less blood circulation of certain brain areas (ischemic stroke). Microangiopathic brain lesions causes 25 % of all ischemic strokes and {{is the most}} frequent cause of recurrent ischemic strokes with 34 %. Microangiopathic brain lesions represents a complicated illness whose pathogeny is influenced by a huge number, possibly interactivating, factors. A row of single factors, like arterial hypertension, diabetes mellitus and hyperlipidemia could be identified up to now as risk factors microangiopathic brain lesions. In the present study 64 patients with symptomatic microangiopathic brain lesions were examined. More than 30 clinical and paraclinical data were grasped and correlated with the picture-morphological gravity degree of microangiopathic brain lesions. Besides, underline {{the results of the present}} study that leukoaraiosis and lacunare lesions show different entities of symptomatic microangiopathic brain lesions. Different clinical and paraklinische parameters stand out in the risk profile of leukoaraiosis and lacunar lesions. Between leukoaraiosis and the cognitive scores SISCO, MMSE and ME as well as between leukoaraiosis and hyperlipidemia significant connections could be calculated. Even the subpoints MMSE and ME for themselves taken were able to register leukoaraiosis. Hyperlipidemia reduces significantly the risk of moderate and heavy leukoaraiosis. Hyperlipidemia can be evaluated therefore as a negative indicator for Leukoaraiose, some authors discuss even a protektive role of hyperlipidemia against microangiopathic brain lesions. In addition, leucoaraiosis correlations pointed to the age and to retinopathy, however, without significance. The proportional portion of the patients with a retinopathy rises monotonously with increasing gravity degree of the leukoaraiosis. Also other authors see on account of similar histopathology of retinal and cerebral Arteriolen in the representation of the retinal vessels to recognise a suitable method, early microangiopathic brain lesions as a non-invasive investigation, before it becomes manifest to clinically and radiologically. In view of the number of lacunar lesions clinical deficits could be found, measured with the help of the NIHSS, the preceding stroke events and migraine increases with patients with a bigger number of lacunar lesions. Nevertheless, a statistical significance could not be found. The limitative factor of the present study lies in the essentials in the restricted number of the enclosed patients. This was above all caused by the <b>extraordinary</b> <b>expenditure</b> to grasp a huge number of clinical and paraclinical factors uniformly with all patients and to examine. The results point in particular to the importance to make early the diagnosis of microangiopathic brain lesions and to take suitable prevention measures therefore straight for the respective microangiopathy entity. Concerning this possibilities of an untimelier diagnostics were suggested. Greater invested studies could help to confirm the results and conclusions...|$|E
