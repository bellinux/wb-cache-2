5|$|Though the Giants {{kept the}} game {{close in the}} first half, and went into halftime down 10–0, the Ravens {{dominated}} the second half. Their defense (led by game MVP Ray Lewis) frustrated Kerry Collins all game long, resulting in Collins turning {{in one of the}} worst playoff performances in Super Bowl history. Collins completed 15 of 39 passes for 112yards and 4 interceptions. The Ravens won the game 34–7 {{in one of the most}} lopsided Super Bowls ever. The lone Giants score came on a Ron Dixon <b>kickoff</b> return for a touchdown. On the very next <b>kickoff,</b> the Ravens countered as Jermaine Lewis also returned a <b>kickoff</b> for a touchdown.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech {{also was}} rated higher than Tennessee {{in every major}} special teams category. The Hokies were in the top 25 in both <b>kickoff</b> return yardage defense and <b>kickoff</b> returns and were No. 16 nationally in {{turnover}} margin.|$|E

5|$|After {{scoring a}} safety touch, the scoring team has {{the option of}} {{taking control of the}} ball and {{beginning}} play from their own 35-yard line, kicking the ball off from their 35-yard line, or accepting a <b>kickoff</b> from the 25-yard line of the team that conceded the score. If a <b>kickoff</b> is chosen it must be a place kick, and the ball can be held, placed on the ground, or placed on a tee prior to the kick. As in American football, the ball must go at least ten yards before it can be recovered by the kicking team.|$|E
5|$|After the score, Tech was penalized 15 {{yards for}} {{excessive}} celebration, allowing Texas {{a better chance}} to return the post-score <b>kickoff.</b> Texas' kick returner fumbled the return, however and the ball rolled out of bounds at the Texas 10-yard line. On the first play after the <b>kickoff,</b> Brown was sacked at the Texas two-yard line. Williams regained some of the lost yardage with a five-yard run, but on third down he was stopped after another five-yard gain. Rather than attempt to convert the fourth down, Texas punted with 2:33 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|Tennessee's post-touchdown <b>kickoff</b> was {{returned}} to the Tech 33-yard line, but Virginia Tech decided to not run an inconsequential play to drain the final seconds from the clock and enter halftime.

Instant replay revealed there were two seconds remaining on the game clock after the play, and Virginia Tech placekicker Matt Waldron came onto the field to complete a 21-yard field goal as time expired.

5|$|The quickest {{score in}} NFL history {{occurred}} on September 8, 2013, in the Steelers season opener against the Tennessee Titans, when the Steelers scored a safety {{on the opening}} <b>kickoff</b> three seconds into the game.

The Steelers, however, lost the game 16-9, which was also their first home opener loss since Heinz Field opened.|$|E
