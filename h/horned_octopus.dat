50|$|The {{curled octopus}} (Eledone cirrhosa), {{also known as}} the <b>horned</b> <b>octopus,</b> lesser octopus or {{northern}} octopus, is a species of cephalopod found in the northeast Atlantic, ranging from Norway to the Mediterranean, including the British Isles.|$|E
50|$|The largest {{recorded}} {{musky octopus}} {{was a male}} with a mantle length of 188 mm, a total length of 740 mm and a mass of 1414 g, caught in the Gulf of İzmir (Gulf of Smyrna), in the Aegean Sea. It {{is closely related to}} the <b>horned</b> <b>octopus,</b> Eledone cirrhosa, but can be distinguished by a number of features; for example, E. moschata has smooth skin and smells of musk, while E. cirrhosa has warty skin and no musky odour.|$|E
40|$|Persistent organochlorines, such as {{polychlorinated biphenyls}} {{including}} coplanar congeners and DDT compounds were {{measured in the}} liver of different species of mollusc cephalopods: broadtail squid (Illex coindetii), <b>horned</b> <b>octopus</b> (Eledone moschata) and spider octopus (Octopus salutii) collected in two {{different areas of the}} Adriatic Sea (central and southern Adriatic Sea). The concentration of PCBs exceeded DDT ones in <b>horned</b> <b>octopus</b> (PCBs: 617. 0 ngg(- 1) lipid weight, DDTs: 188. 0 ngg(- 1) lipid weight) and in spider octopus (PCBs: 590. 0 ngg(- 1) lipid weight, DDTs: 293. 0 ngg(- 1) lipid weight), while in broadtail squid PCB load (748. 0 ngg(- 1) lipid weight) was similar to those of DDTs (514. 5 ngg(- 1) lipid weight). No significant difference in PCB levels was observed among species, while DDT concentrations were higher in broadtail squid than in <b>horned</b> <b>octopus</b> and spider octopus. DDTs composition showed slight differences in relation to species, thought p,p'-DDE was the predominant compound in all cephalopod species (broadtail squid: 88. 1 %, <b>horned</b> <b>octopus</b> 94. 1 %, spider octopus: 97. 5 %). PCB isomer profiles were similar among species being hexachlorinated isomers the most abundant, followed by penta- and heptachlorobiphenyls, while tri- and tetrachlorobiphenyls made up {{a small percentage of the}} total PCB residues. Regarding coplanar congeners, non-ortho PCBs were below the detection limit in all samples and the 2, 3, 7, 8 -TCDD toxic equivalent (TEQ) concentrations were very low. The influence of biological and ecological factors (size/weight and location) on the bioaccumulation of organochlorine compounds has been discussed...|$|E
40|$|Mercury and cadmium {{concentrations}} were {{measured in the}} flesh and liver (or hepatopancreas) of albacore (Thunnus alalunga) and <b>horned</b> <b>octopus</b> (Eledone moschata) to establish whether the concentrations exceeded the maximum levels,fixed by the European Commission. In both species, mercury and cadmium mean {{concentrations were}} higher in liver (albacore: mercury= 2. 41 ug g- 1 wet wt, cadmium= 9. 22 mug g(- 1) wet wt; horned octopus: mercury= 0. 76 mug g(- 1) wet wt, cadmium= 6. 72 mug g(- 1) wet wt) than in flesh (albacore: mercury= 1. 56 mug g(- 1) wet wt, cadmium= 0. 05 mug g(- 1) wet wt; horned octopus: mercury= 0. 36 mug g(- 1) wet wt, cadmium= 033 mug g(- 1)). Mercury concentrations exceeding the prescribed legal limit of 1 mug g(- 1) wet wt were found in almost all albacore samples (flesh: 71. 4 %; liver: 85. 7 %). For <b>horned</b> <b>octopus,</b> concentrations above 0. 5 mug g(- 1) wet wt were observed solely in hepatopancreas, while in flesh, the concentrations were below this limit in all the samples examined. Of the flesh samples of albacore, 42. 8 % exceeded the proposed tolerance for cadmium for human consumption, whilst for <b>horned</b> <b>octopus,</b> the established limit was not exceeded in any sample...|$|E
40|$|Cadmium {{and mercury}} {{concentrations}} were {{measured in the}} flesh and hepatopancreas of different species of cephalopod molluscs (European squid, common octopus, curled octopus, <b>horned</b> <b>octopus,</b> pink cuttlefish, common cuttlefish) {{in order to establish}} whether the concentrations exceeded the maximum levels fixed by the European Commission. In hepatopancreas, the levels of cadmium were substantially higher than those in flesh (flesh 0. 11 - 0. 87 microg g(- 1) wet weight, hepatopancreas 2. 16 - 9. 39 microg g(- 1) wet weight), whilst the levels of mercury (flesh 0. 13 - 0. 55 microg g(- 1) wet weight, hepatopancreas 0. 23 - 0. 79 microg g(- 1)) were approximately double those in flesh. Concentrations exceeding the maximum permitted limit of cadmium were found in 39. 8 and 41. 0 % of common octopus and pink cuttlefish flesh, respectively. For mercury, concentrations above the limit were found only in octopuses, and precisely in 36. 8, 50. 0 and 20. 0 % of flesh samples of common, curled and <b>horned</b> <b>octopus,</b> respectively. In the hepatopancreas, concentrations of cadmium and mercury were above the proposed limits in all the samples examined. The estimated weekly intake of between 0. 09 and 0. 49 microg kg(- 1) body weight for cadmium and between 0. 05 and 0. 24 microg kg(- 1) body weight for mercury made only a small contribution to the provisional tolerable weekly intake (cadmium 1. 3 - 7. 0 %, mercury 1. 0 - 4. 8 %) set by the WHO.

40|$|Cephalopod beaks are chitinous {{structures}} {{situated in}} the buccal mass lying {{at the base of}} their arms. Because they are among the few hard structures of cephalopods with high resistance to erosion during digestive process in predator stomachs, the study of the beak morphometry is of major importance for the species taxonomy, as well as, for the size estimation of the cephalopods consumed. In this study new information is provided on the dimensions and pigmentation process of the upper and lower beak of the <b>horned</b> <b>octopus</b> Eledone cirrhosa derived from 67 female and 47 male specimens caught by trawl in the Thracian Sea (NE Mediterranean). The growth of both beaks was allometric in relation to the mantle length and body weight. According to the results of covariance analysis, no difference was found in growth pattern of beaks between sexes. Four degrees of pigmentation were identified in both upper and lower beaks, the darkening process starting in females at a smaller size...|$|E
40|$|Levels of 18 polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) congeners {{were determined by}} gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) in some marine species, living both in the coastal area and in deeper seawater. In some species analysis was performed separately in edible parts (fillets) and in viscera. The existence and degree of bioaccumulation was assessed studying individual species of very different size, with the smaller being younger. Furthermore, with a multivariate statistical analysis, a correlation between PCB congeners and the feeding habits and habitat of the fish was demonstrated. The results show that fat from edible parts (fish fillets) had total PCB levels in the range 22. 6 – 601. 9 mg kg- 1 (with 601. 9 mg kg- 1 in anchovies), while fat from viscera showed much higher concentrations (407. 3 – 916. 6 mg kg- 1). Bioaccumulation was confirmed, comparing PCB levels between younger and older individual hake, squid, and <b>horned</b> <b>octopus.</b> The total PCB concentration ratio (older/younger individuals) ranges from 2. 11 (squid ¼ 292. 1 / 137. 8 mg kg- 1) to 3. 46 (hake ¼ 546. 0 / 158. 0 mg kg- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Age {{and growth}} of the <b>horned</b> <b>octopus</b> Eledone cirrhosa are {{estimated}} {{for the first time}} by stylet increment analysis. Specimens were collected between March 2009 and March 2010 from the commercial trawl fishery operating off northwestern Iberian coasts. A pool of stylets representing all size classes were defined by means of modal progression analysis performed separately for each sex in northern and western fishing grounds over a total of 2220 individuals (306 males and 595 females from the northern fishing ground; and 379 males and 940 females from the western fishing ground). In total, 122 stylets belonging to individuals with a total weight ranging from 67 to 950 g were successfully analysed. Age of the specimens was estimated assuming a daily deposition rate of growth increments within the stylet. Estimated age of the specimens varied from 106 to 516 days. Differential longevity between sexes was observed, with females reaching a life span of 17 months while males attained reached only 14 months, although the possibility that this difference might be even greater is discussed. Based on estimated age, hatching date was back-calculated and it was concluded that hatching occurs throughout the year, with a peak in winter. Relative instantaneous growth rates estimated for 90 -day age classes, ranged from 0. 03 % to 2. 17 % of body weight per day, depending on age. The results obtained are compared with the information available on this species...|$|E
