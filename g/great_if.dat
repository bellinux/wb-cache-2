5|$|Chris Beveridge's {{review for}} Fandom Post was highly {{positive}} towards the anime series, {{calling it a}} dark horse contender {{as one of their}} top new anime series of the year. Beveridge praised the technical and fundamental aspects of magic in the series for breaking the supernatural approach other works usually take and liked the potential impact it could have on future events. However, while the reviewer liked the series' technicality, they noted it will frustrate certain viewers in that aspect. Richard Eisenbeis, writing for Kotaku, liked the characters, story, the complex and technical magic system, and mysteries. However, Eisenbeis criticized the exposition, citing it to be poorly timed, heavy, and failing to explain things with better clarity. He concluded his review by writing how the anime might have been <b>great</b> <b>if</b> a different director or screenwriting was hired.|$|E

Actual governing practice within the congregation ranges from congregational voters' assemblies or annual and special congregational meetings to elder-and-council-led, to congregations where the senior pastor wields <b>great,</b> <b>if</b> informal, power (more common in larger churches).|$|E

25|$|The belly helve hammer was {{the kind}} {{normally}} found in a finery forge, used for making pig iron into forgeable bar iron. This was lifted by cams striking the helve between the pivot and the head. The head usually weighed quarter of a ton. This was probably the case because the strain on a wooden helve {{would have been too}} <b>great</b> <b>if</b> the head were heavier.|$|E
25|$|Since the MNF {{schedule}} {{is set in}} April and cannot be changed, the league and network cannot guarantee a late season matchup will have any significance or be highly anticipated. Teams thought to be good during the off-season could be out of playoff contention {{by the middle of}} the season; a prime example occurred in 1999, when the San Francisco 49ers and Atlanta Falcons both entered the season's final MNF game with 4–11 records. It had seemed like a good pre-season matchup since the Falcons had played in the previous season's Super Bowl and the 49ers coming into the 1999 season had posted 16 consecutive 10-win seasons. It is also possible for a team like the 1999 St. Louis Rams not to be scheduled for a Monday night game because of its dismal record the year before, and many other NFL teams (such as the 2004 San Diego Chargers, with zero primetime games) have had huge unforeseen turnarounds that result in lack of MNF attention (these teams generally receive multiple MNF spots the year after their breakout success, which is great for viewers if those teams continue to play well, and not so <b>great</b> <b>if</b> they return to mediocrity or worse). However, the forecasting abilities of the NFL's scheduling officials have exhibited uncanny proficiency. Many MNF games occurring later in the season feature at least one team that is either headed to the playoffs or must win the MNF game to clinch a playoff spot.|$|E

500|$|The {{danger is}} perhaps not <b>great</b> <b>if</b> the people of one State, through their legislature, decide that Lady Chatterley's Lover goes so far beyond the {{acceptable}} standards of candor {{that it will be}} deemed offensive and non-sellable, for the State next door is still free to make its own choice. At least we do not have one uniform standard. But the dangers to free thought and expression are truly <b>great</b> <b>if</b> the Federal Government imposes a blanket ban over the Nation on such a book. [...] The fact that the people of one State cannot read some of the works of D. H. Lawrence seems to me, if not wise or desirable, at least acceptable. But that no person in the United States should be allowed to do so {{seems to me to be}} intolerable, and violative of both the letter and spirit of the First Amendment.|$|E
500|$|Around {{the release}} of the film, Disney {{executive}} David Hoberman was quoted, [...] "I hope Nightmare goes out and makes a fortune. If it does, <b>great.</b> <b>If</b> it doesn't, that doesn't negate the validity of the process. The budget was less than any Disney blockbuster so it doesn't have to earn Aladdin-sized grosses to satisfy us."

Spotnitz has noted that the actor cast for the role, Brian Thompson, was chosen because he had a very [...] "distinctive look" [...] about him, most notably his face and mouth.|$|E

500|$|Conran {{summed up}} what {{influenced}} him in making Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow: [...] "We tried {{to approach it}} almost as though we lived in that era and were just another group of artists {{trying to make a}} work out of those pieces and inspirations. We wanted the film to feel like a lost film of that era. If we're a footnote in the history of pulp art and Golden Age comics, that'd be enough, that'd be <b>great.</b> <b>If</b> we even just inspire some people to go back and investigate some of that stuff, we'd have done enough." ...|$|E

[...] Teammate Mitchell Page said, [...] "It wasn't until I saw Rickey that I {{understood}} what baseball was about. Rickey Henderson is a run, man. That's it. When you see Rickey Henderson, I don't care when, the score's already 1–0. If he's with you, that's <b>great.</b> <b>If</b> he's not, you won't like it." ...|$|E

[...] Complex ranked Kim Stolz's cameo on its list of [...] "the 25 worst cameos in TV history."

500|$|Phillips {{missed the}} opening match of the 1901 {{international}} season against England {{due to an}} injury to his knee: he was replaced {{at the last moment}} by Bala Jones of Aberavon RFC. Thinking that he had recovered, Phillips was back for the following match, against Scotland on 9 February at Inverleith, but within ten minutes he was almost helpless. He played on, and 'his last match was a tragic end to a <b>great</b> <b>if</b> short career.' The Scottish half-backs, Jimmy Gillespie and Frank Fasson, outplayed Lloyd and Phillips, and prevented the Welsh backline from receiving much ball. Scotland beat Wales 18–8, and the Welsh defeat was blamed on the half-backs.|$|E

500|$|The {{founders of}} Circus Juventas, Dan and Betty Butler, met as {{teenagers}} at the Sailor Circus of Sarasota during the mid-1970s. Dan was a catcher on the flying trapeze, and Betty was an aerialist on the cloud swing. They began dating at age sixteen, {{went on to}} perform at Florida State University's Flying High Circus, and married in 1980. Dan became a successful real estate broker in Atlanta, but faced bankruptcy and chemical dependency. The couple came to reside in Minnesota because Dan Butler was receiving {{alcohol and drug abuse}} rehabilitation at Hazelden. The Butlers attended Sailor Circus reunions together and after one, in April 1994, Betty Butler wondered, [...] "Wouldn't it be <b>great</b> <b>if</b> we could do something in ?" ...|$|E

500|$|According to Lee, several core {{concepts}} {{were already}} in place from Buck and Del Vecho's early work, such as the film's [...] "frozen heart" [...] hook: [...] "That was a concept and the phrase... an act of true love will thaw a frozen heart." [...] They already knew the ending involved true love {{in the sense of}} the emotional bond between siblings, not romance, in that [...] "Anna was going to save Elsa. We didn’t know how or why." [...] Lee said Edwin Catmull, president of Disney Animation, told her early on about the film's ending: [...] "First and foremost, no matter what you have to do to the story, do it. But you have to earn that ending. If you do it will be <b>great.</b> <b>If</b> you don't, it will suck." ...|$|E
500|$|Carter said of {{the casting}} of Nick Chinlund as Pfaster, [...] "I {{thought it was a}} wonderfully creepy villain. The casting of that show was very difficult. We saw many actors, but there was a quality I was looking for and I couldn't put a name on that quality. I finally figured out what it was when Nick came in and he had a kind of {{androgynous}} quality that worked. I thought he looked like Joe College, but he could scare the hell out of you." [...] Producer Glen Morgan said Chinlund's performance was outstanding. Nutter stated [...] "Nick Chinlund was wonderful to work with. The guy was like putty in my hands. He was <b>great.</b> <b>If</b> you're looking for someone to underline the weirdness and strangeness of the character, he did that." ...|$|E
