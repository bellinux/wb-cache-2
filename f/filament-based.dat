50|$|Recent {{advances}} in lighting technology {{have also made}} available a completely new technology for aquarium lighting: light emitting diodes (LEDs). Although LEDs themselves are not new, the technology has only recently been adapted to produce systems with qualities {{that allow them to}} be considered viable alternatives to gas- and <b>filament-based</b> aquarium lighting systems. The newness of the technology does cause them to be relatively expensive, but these systems bring several advantages over traditional lighting. Although their initial cost is much higher, they tend to be economical in the long run because they consume less power and have far longer lifespans than other systems. Also, because LED systems are made of hundreds of very small bulbs, a microcomputer can control their output to simulate daybreak and sunset. Some systems also have the ability to simulate moonlight and the phases of the moon, as well as vary the color temperature of the light produced. Moreover, some manufacturers produce LED lighting systems in single bright and double bright intensities for sustaining coral life in marine aquariums.|$|E

30|$|The phase FET has showed its {{promising}} characteristics for {{low power}} applications, {{because of its}} superior switching feature. However, there is still room for more improvement. The characteristic of <b>filament-based</b> TS device can be determined, most likely by the material, likewise CBRAM. Hence, various metal oxides need to be investigated, to look for best option. For example, ferroelectric tunnel junction (FTJ) [93] can be worked as the TS device in phase FET. Recently, Pb(Zr 0.52 Ti 0.48)O 3 -based phase FET was introduced by Shin et al. [94].|$|E
30|$|Phase FET with VO 2 {{material}} {{has been introduced}} because the material (VO 2) has stable resistive switching as well as low “ON” resistance. VO- 2 is transformed to low resistance state at 340  K. This means that the resistive switching cannot be appropriately used for high temperature applications (e.g., CPU is usually running beyond 340  K). Moreover, the resistance of VO 2 is {{lower than that of}} <b>filament-based</b> TS device (which is explained below, to suppress the off-state leakage current of state-of-the-art transistor). For those aformentioned reasons, many new materials have been proposed to address the technical issues.|$|E
30|$|Finally, {{the delay}} {{time and the}} {{on-state}} drive current of phase FET must be deeply investigated. Various <b>filament-based</b> TS devices have showed more or less slow switching time property (i.e., 0.1 – 1  μs) as well as low on-state drive current (i.e., 10 – 100  μA). In 2016, Song et al. showed TiO 2 -based phase FET with AgTe electrode (instead of Ag electrode) [96]. Telluride (Te) helps to dissolve the Ag filament, so that the TS device can be utilized at higher compliance current (~  100  μA) [97]. Moreover, the delay time is dramatically improved by a factor of ~  10. Therefore, the method using chalcogenide materials needs to be developed and finely tuned.|$|E

30|$|Recently, a {{thermionic}} <b>filament-based</b> miniature X-ray {{tube with}} {{the diameter of}} 2.25 mm and the dose rate of a 15 Gy/min (at 1 cm water depth) is commercialized for an X-ray source of electric brachytherapy [13, 14]. However, total operating time has been not guaranteed higher than 2.5 h. In such a thermionic <b>filament-based</b> X-ray tube, high temperature operation of the filament is necessary to increase X-ray dose rate, reducing the lifetime of the filament especially in non-high vacuum environment. CNT field emitters, particularly of a sharp tip shape, {{have been developed for}} high-resolution electron and X-ray devices [6, 7, 16 – 18]. CNT tip emitters can provide high-brightness electron beams due to their point-like electron emission sites. However, a sharp tip emitter has limited number of CNTs and thus each CNT must supply high electron emission current for the application to a high-power X-ray tube. As a result, CNTs can be easily damaged by high joule heating as well as ion particle adsorption [19]. In addition, an electron beam that is produced from a sharp tip is diverged because the electric field generated near the sharp exerts outward forces on the electrons generated from the tip. This diverged beam might be lost during the transport to an X-ray target in a miniature X-ray tube, which prevents the stable operation of the X-ray tube. One of the methods to overcome these properties of CNT tip emitters is to use a flat-tip CNTs, in which many CNTs are attached on a comparatively large area of flat metal substrate. In comparison with a sharp tip emitters, a flat-tip CNT emitter reduces the electrical power loading per each CNT and can provide more parallel electron beam.|$|E

This band forecasts a specific division plane before the initiation of mitosis. During cytokinesis, another plant-specific cytoskeletal structure called the phragmoplast guides vesicles {{in the creation of a}} new cell wall. In addition, a number of cytoskeleton-associated proteins are reportedly involved in the formation and function of the preprophase band, mitotic spindle, and phragmoplast.

30|$|Since the {{quantized}} conductance {{phenomenon is}} {{the property of}} nanoscale conductors, the materials of RRAM devices especially those consisting of the CF {{play an important role}} to the quantized conductance behaviors. As has been discussed in “Introduction” section, the types of RS and electrode materials determine resistive switching mechanisms for the <b>filament-based</b> RRAM. For ECM devices, resistive layer is sandwiched between an inert electrode and an active electrode. During the forming and SET process, the metal ions of the active electrode are driven into the resistive layer, forming the CF. For VCM devices, both top and bottom electrode are inert and the CF is consisted of oxygen vacancies. So as for the ECM mechanism, the material of the active electrode is critical for the observation of the quantized conductance, while for the VCM mechanism, the material of the resistive layer plays a more important role.|$|E
40|$|Different {{interacting}} signaling modules involving Ca 2 +/calmodulin-dependent myosin {{light chain}} kinase, Ca 2 +-independent regulatory light chain phosphorylation, myosin phosphatase inhibition, and actin <b>filament-based</b> proteins are proposed as specific cellular mechanisms {{involved in the}} regulation of smooth muscle contraction. However, {{the relative importance of}} specific modules is not well defined. By using tamoxifen-activated and smooth muscle-specific knock-out of myosin light chain kinase in mice, we analyzed its role in tonic airway smooth muscle contraction. Knock-out of the kinase in both tracheal and bronchial smooth muscle significantly reduced contraction and myosin phosphorylation responses to K+-depolarization and acetylcholine. Kinase-deficient mice lacked bronchial constrictions in normal and asthmatic airways, whereas the asthmatic inflammation response was not affected. These results indicate that myosin light chain kinase acts as a central participant in the contractile signaling module of tonic smooth muscle. Importantly, contractile airway smooth muscles are necessary for physiological and asthmatic airway resistance...|$|E
40|$|Measuring inflammation-induced {{changes in}} {{thresholds}} of hind paw withdrawal from mechanical pressure {{is a useful}} technique to assess changes in pain perception in rodents. Withdrawal thresholds can be measured first at baseline and then following drug, venom, injury, allergen, or otherwise evoked inflammation by applying an accurate force on very specific areas of the skin. An electronic von Frey apparatus allows precise assessment of mouse hind paw withdrawal thresholds that are not limited by the available filament sizes in contrast to classical von Frey measurements. The ease and rapidity of measurements allow for incorporation of assessment of tactile sensitivity outcomes in diverse models of rapid-onset inflammatory and neuropathic pain as multiple measurements can be taken {{within a short time}} period. Experimental measurements for individual rodent subjects can be internally controlled against individual baseline responses and exclusion criteria easily established to standardize baseline responses within and across experimental groups. Thus, measurements using an electronic von Frey apparatus represent a useful modification of the well-established classical von Frey <b>filament-based</b> assays for rodent mechanical allodynia that may also be applied to other nonhuman mammalian models...|$|E

40|$|Loss of {{myofibril}} {{organization is}} a common feature of chronic dilated and progressive cardiomyopathy. To study how the heart compensates for myofibril degeneration, transgenic mice were created that undergo progressive loss of myofibrils after birth. Myofibril degeneration was induced by overexpression of tropomodulin, {{a component of the}} thin filament complex which determines and maintains sarcomeric actin filament length. The tropomodulin cDNA was placed under control of the alpha-myosin heavy chain gene promoter to overexpress tropomodulin specifically in the myocardium. Offspring with the most severe phenotype showed cardiomyopathic changes between 2 and 4 wk after birth. Hearts from these mice present characteristics consistent with dilated cardiomyopathy and a failed hypertrophic response. Histological analysis showed widespread loss of myofibril organization. Confocal microscopy of isolated cardiomyocytes revealed intense tropomodulin immunoreactivity in transgenic mice together with abnormal coincidence of tropomodulin and alpha-actinin reactivity at Z discs. Contractile function was compromised severely as determined by echocardiographic analyses and isolated Langendorff heart preparations. This novel experimentally induced cardiomyopathy will be useful for understanding dilated cardiomyopathy and the effect of thin <b>filament-based</b> myofibril degeneration upon cardiac structure and function...|$|E
40|$|Anchoring or {{adhering}} junctions are {{points at}} which cells attach to neighboring cells. They {{play an important}} role in determining and maintaining tissue organization (for reviews, see Yap et al, 1997; Tsukita et al, 2001; Cheng and Mruk, 2002). In the testis, unique cell-cell actin-based adherens junctions (AJs) between Sertoli cells, as well as between Sertoli and germ cells, and cell-cell intermediate <b>filament-based</b> desmosome-like junctions between Sertoli and germ cells (for reviews, see Russell and Peterson, 1985; Russell et al, 1990; Byers et al, 1993; Russell, 1993) not only provide mechanical adhesion of germ cells onto Sertoli cells, they also play a crucial role in germ cell morphogenesis and differentiation (Ozaki-Kuroda et al, 2002). In addition, the turnover of these junctions in the testis is important for permitting germ cell translocation from the basal compartment to the adluminal compartment of the seminiferous epithelium to complete spermatogenesis. In this review we limit our discussion to the recent and crucial development of the study of AJs instead of desmosome-like anchoring junctions because the latter type has been reviewed elsewhere (Russell and Peterson...|$|E
40|$|Animal cells {{contain a}} single {{centrosome}} that nucleates and organizes a polarized array of microtubules which functions in many cellular processes. In most cells the centrosome {{is composed of}} two centrioles surrounded by an ill-defined “cloud” of pericentriolar material. Recently, γ-tubulin-containing 25 -nm diameter ring structures {{have been identified as}} likely microtubule nucleation sites within the pericentriolar material of isolated centrosomes. Here we demonstrate that when Spisula centrosomes are extracted with 1. 0 M KI they lose their microtubule nucleation potential and appear by three-dimensional electron microscopy as a complex lattice, built from 12 - to 15 -nm thick elementary fiber(s), that lack centrioles and 25 -nm rings. Importantly, when these remnants are incubated in extracts prepared from Spisula oocytes they recover their 25 -nm rings, γ-tubulin, and microtubule nucleation potential. This recovery process occurs in the absence of microtubules, divalent cations, and nucleotides. Thus, in animals the centrosome is structurally organized around a KI-insoluble <b>filament-based</b> “centromatrix” that serves as a scaffold to which those proteins required for microtubule nucleation bind, either directly or indirectly, in a divalent cation and nucleotide independent manner...|$|E

40|$|A {{time-of-flight}} {{mass spectrometer}} (TOF-MS) {{like the one}} mentioned in the immediately preceding article has been retrofitted with an ionizer based on a surface spontaneous-desorption process. This ionizer includes an electron multiplier {{in the form of}} a microchannel plate (MCP). Relative to an ionizer based on a hot-filament electron source, this ionizer offers advantages of less power consumption and greater mechanical ruggedness. The current density and stability characteristics of the electron emission of this ionizer are similar to those of a <b>filament-based</b> ionizer. In tests of various versions of this ionizer in the TOF-MS, electron currents up to 100 nA were registered. Currents of microamperes or more - great enough to satisfy requirements in most TOFMS applications - could be obtained by use of MCPs different from those used in the tests, albeit at the cost of greater bulk. One drawback of this ionizer is that the gain of the MCP decreases as a function of the charge extracted thus far; the total charge that can be extracted over the operational lifetime is about 1 coulomb. An MCP in the ion-detector portion of the TOF-MS is subject to the same limitation...|$|E
40|$|We present new Submillimeter Array (SMA) {{observations}} of CO(2 - 1) outflows toward young, embedded protostars in the Perseus molecular cloud {{as part of}} the Mass Assembly of Stellar Systems and their Evolution with the SMA (MASSES) survey. For 57 Perseus protostars, we characterize the orientation of the outflow angles and compare them with the orientation of the local filaments as derived from Herschel observations. We find that the relative angles between outflows and filaments are inconsistent with purely parallel or purely perpendicular distributions. Instead, the observed distribution of outflow-filament angles are more consistent with either randomly aligned angles or a mix of projected parallel and perpendicular angles. A mix of parallel and perpendicular angles requires perpendicular alignment to be more common by a factor of ∼ 3. Our results show that the observed distributions probably hold regardless of the protostar's multiplicity, age, or the host core's opacity. These observations indicate that the angular momentum axis of a protostar may be independent of the large-scale structure.

We have generated a mouse line bearing floxed plectin alleles and conditionally deleted plectin in stratified epithelia. This strategy enabled us to study the consequences of plectin deficiency in this particular type of tissues {{in the context of the}} whole organism without plectin loss affecting other tissues. Conditional knockout mice died early after birth, showing signs of starvation and growth retardation. Blistering was observed on their extremities and on the oral epithelium after initial nursing, impairing food uptake. Knockout epidermis was very fragile and showed focal epidermal barrier defects caused by the presence of small skin lesions. Stratification, proliferation and differentiation of knockout skin seemed unaffected by epidermis-restricted plectin deficiency. In an additionally generated mouse model, tamoxifen-induced Cre-ERT-mediated recombination led to mice with a mosaic plectin deletion pattern in adult epidermis, combined with microblister formation and epidermal barrier defects. Our study explains the early lethality of plectin-deficient mice and provides a model to ablate plectin in adult animals which could be used for developing gene or pharmacological therapies...|$|E

Cardiac muscle-specific expression of the fast skeletal muscle TnT has been obtained with significant myofibril incorporation. Expression of the endogenous cardiac muscle thin filament regulatory proteins, such as troponin I and tropomyosin, was not altered in the transgenic mouse heart, providing an authentic system for the functional characterization of TnT isoforms. Cardiac muscle contractility was analysed for the force vs. Ca 2 + relationship in skinned ventricular trabeculae of transgenic mice in comparison with wild-type litter-mates. The results showed unchanged pCa 50 values (5. 1 ± 0. 04 and 5. 1 ± 0. 1, respectively) but significantly steeper slopes (the Hill coefficient was 2. 0 ± 0. 2 vs. 1. 0 ± 0. 2, P < 0. 05).

40|$|To address {{questions}} about mechanisms of <b>filament-based</b> organelle transport, a system {{was developed to}} image and track mitochondria in an intact Drosophila nervous system. Mutant analyses suggest that the primary motors for mitochondrial movement in larval motor axons are kinesin- 1 (anterograde) and cytoplasmic dynein (retrograde), and interestingly that kinesin- 1 is critical for retrograde transport by dynein. During transport, there was little evidence that force production by the two opposing motors was competitive, suggesting a mechanism for alternate coordination. Tests of the possible coordination factor P 150 Glued suggested that it indeed influenced both motors on axonal mitochondria, {{but there was no}} evidence that its function was critical for the motor coordination mechanism. Observation of organelle-filled axonal swellings (“organelle jams” or “clogs”) caused by kinesin and dynein mutations showed that mitochondria could move vigorously within and pass through them, indicating that they were not the simple steric transport blockades suggested previously. We speculate that axonal swellings may instead reflect sites of autophagocytosis of senescent mitochondria that are stranded in axons by retrograde transport failure; a protective process aimed at suppressing cell death signals and neurodegeneration...|$|E

The present study involved an in-depth miRNome analysis of two human acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cell lines, HL- 60 and THP- 1, and one human chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) cell line, K 562, via massively parallel signature sequencing. mRNA expression profiles of these cell lines that were established previously in our lab facilitated an integrative analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression patterns. miRNA expression profiling followed by differential expression analysis and target prediction suggested numerous miRNA signatures in AML and CML cell lines. Some miRNAs may act as either tumor suppressors or oncomiRs in AML and CML by targeting key genes in AML and CML pathways. Expression patterns of cell type-specific miRNAs could partially reflect the characteristics of K 562, HL- 60 and THP- 1 cell lines, such as actin <b>filament-based</b> processes, responsiveness to stimulus and phagocytic activity. miRNAs may also regulate myeloid differentiation, since they usually suppress differentiation regulators. Our study provides a resource to further investigate the employment of miRNAs in human leukemia subtyping, leukemogenesis and myeloid development.

To discriminate between {{the effects of}} calcium binding and myosin binding on thin-filament activity, measurements were performed after caged-calcium photolysis in fibers with full-filament or no-filament overlap, or during force recovery after a quick release. All three reflections examined, i. e., the second actin layer line (second ALL, reporting the tropomyosin movement), the sixth ALL (reporting actin structural change), and the meridional troponin reflections, exhibited calcium-induced and myosin-induced components, but their rate constants and polarities were different. Generally, calcium-induced components exhibited fast rate constants (> 100 s− 1). The myosin-induced components of the second ALL had a rate constant {{similar to that of}} the force (7 – 10 s− 1), but that of the sixth ALL was apparently faster. The myosin-induced component of troponin reflection was the only one with negative polarity, and was too slow to be analyzed with this protocol. The results suggest that the three regulation-related proteins change their structures with different rate constants, and the significance of these findings is discussed in the context of a cooperative thin-filament activation mechanism...|$|E

In our previous study, Ezrin was knock down and analyzed by mRNA expression profile {{which has not been}} fully mined. In this study, we applied protein-protein interactions (PPI) network knowledge and methods to explore our understanding of these differentially expressed genes (DEGs). PPI subnetworks showed that hundreds of DEGs interact with thousands of other proteins. Subcellular localization analyses found that the DEGs and their directly or indirectly interacting proteins distribute in multiple layers, which was applied to analyze the shortest paths between EZR and other DEGs. Gene ontology annotation generated a functional annotation map and found hundreds of significant terms, especially those associated with cytoskeleton organization of Ezrin protein, such as “cytoskeleton organization,” “regulation of actin <b>filament-based</b> process,” and “regulation of actin cytoskeleton organization. ” The algorithm of Random Walk with Restart was applied to prioritize the DEGs and identified several cancer related DEGs ranked closest to EZR.

40|$|TBCCD 1 is {{an enigmatic}} {{member of the}} tubulin-binding {{cofactor}} C (TBCC) family of proteins required for mother-daughter centriole linkage in the green alga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii and nucleus-centrosome-Golgi linkage in mammalian cells. Loss of these linkages has severe morphogenetic consequences, but the mechanism(s) through which TBCCD 1 contributes to cell organisation is unknown. In the African sleeping sickness parasite Trypanosoma brucei a microtubule-dominant cytoskeleton dictates cell shape, influencing strongly the positioning and inheritance patterns of key intracellular organelles. Here we show the trypanosome orthologue of TBCCD 1 is found at multiple locations: centrioles, the centriole-associated Golgi 'bi-lobe', and the anterior end of the cell body. Loss of TbTBCCD 1 results in disorganisation of the structurally complex 'bi-lobe' architecture and loss of centriole linkage to the parasite's single unit-copy mitochondrial genome (or kinetoplast). We therefore identify TBCCD 1 as an essential protein associated {{with at least two}} <b>filament-based</b> structures in the trypanosome cytoskeleton. The last common ancestor of trypanosomes, animals and green algae was arguably the last common ancestor of all eukaryotes. Based on our observations, and interpretation of published data, we argue for unexpected co-option of the TBCC domain for an essential, non-tubulin related function, at an early point during evolution of the eukaryotic cytoskeleton...|$|E
