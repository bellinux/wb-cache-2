40|$|In {{wastewater}} disposal the unsolved organic and mineral substances that {{are contained in}} the wastewater play a decisive role. In all surveys these solids have not been given sufficient attention, although they significantly influence the operation and service life of drainage systems by forming deposits. In the future, these effects are likely to intensify due to the {{turning away from the}} common practice of draining all stromwater flows that occur on settlement and traffic areas quickly and to the greatest possible extent. The measures taken to decentrally retain or seep stormwater namely have more or less strong influence on the drainage and self-cleaning capacity of a sewer system and thus on the formation of deposits. Furthermore, mineral solids in the wastewater deserve special attention when looking at water pollution caused by organic micro elements as many of these micro pollutants preferably accumulate on solid particles and thus enter bodies of water via discharges from sewer systens. In the face of the importance of mineral solids, special efforts to prevent their entry into drainage systems appear necessary. Based on an analysis of the solids' origin, composition and quantity contained in the wastewater road gullies offer the greatest potential to retain solids. As results of the performed laboratory and in-situ tests as well as a weak point analysis have shown, road gullies that are standardised in DIN 4052 and have been used so far fulfill their function of retaining solids only to a very insufficient level. Here, their productivity is heavily influenced by the practiced cleaning intervals. In order to optimise the retention of solids, the separative road gully (SSA), which is presented in the survey at hand, was developed. It is based on the concept of mechanically separating the solids that are contained in the road gully from the liquid phase. A special system ensures that this is carried out in the most concentrated way and in three steps. In addition, it prevents retained solids from being mobilised irrespenctive of the duration and intensity of precipitation events. The tests and optimisation of the constructive and hydraulic approaches as well as the verification of the functionality and efficiency of the SSA were performed within the scope of laboratory test and in-situ tests over several years. Here, as a comparison conventional road gullies were also taken into account. Improvements in the retention of solids by the SSA arose without utilising its capacities under test conditions. Compared to road gullies that comprise a sediment chamber the performance increased by around 32 % and compared to road gullies with <b>floor</b> <b>outlet</b> even up to 81 %. In this way for the SSA the verification of suitability could be provided as a decentral measure to reduce solid entry into sewer systems. An area-wide conversion of conventional road gullies to the SSA also appears economically interesting in the medium term as the cleaning costs for sewer systems could be significantly reduced...|$|E

40|$|Measurements {{were made}} of the thermal {{performance}} of a floor-based, occupant-controlled ventilation system. The experiments were performed in a controlled environment chamber configured to resemble an interior zone of a modern office building with modular workstation furniture and partitions.

Tests were conducted to investigate the effects of supply volume, supply location, supply direction, supply/return temperature difference, heat load density, and workstation size and layout. Temperature differences {{in the range of}} 1 °C to 2. 5 °C between adjacent workstations were observed, and stratification in the room was strongly dependent on the supply air volume. The jet flow characteristics of the <b>floor</b> supply <b>outlets</b> produced high velocities in their immediate vicinity, increasing the risk of draft discomfort in these regions.

40|$|Utilizing {{raised floor}} system to {{facilitate}} cable management becomes {{a trend in}} modern intelligent buildings. Underfloor ventilation systems, which {{make use of the}} sub-floor plenum below the raised floor for conditioned air distribution, are also gaining popularity. The ductless operating principle of the underfloor ventilation system enhances space flexibility. Supplying conditioned air from the floor level also inherents advantages in improving indoor air quality and energy saving. Two types of the underfloor ventilation systems are commonly found including the top-level return type (TR) and the floor-level return type (FR). Thermal comfort and indoor air quality aspects of both the TR and the FR. underfloor systems were experimentally investigated in the present study. The most commonly used straight vane type floor supply diffusers were used in the experiments. The performance of traditional ceiling-based system with widely adopted 4 -way spread type supply diffusers was also determined under the same conditions for comparison purpose. A controlled experimental room was developed to facilitate the experiments. High risk of draught was observed near the supply outlet of the underfloor ventilation systems. However, draught discomfort can be reduced by the underfloor system compared to the ceiling based system. Similar to the traditional ceiling based system, vertical temperature differences in the occupied region were lower than 3 °C under all the tested conditions for the TR system. Temperature variations higher than the international comfort standards were observed with the FR system when Archimedes number (Ar) was higher than 0. 03. Lower Predicted Mean Vote (PMV) values were resulted with both types of underfloor ventilation systems compared to the ceiling-based one. Lower cooling effect should be provided when using the underfloor systems to avoid overcooling to the occupants. The age of air experiments showed that the ceiling-based system maintained a uniform distribution of ventilation in the space. Compared to the ceiling-based system, improvements in ventilation were achieved with the use of TR or FR system in regions near the <b>floor</b> supply <b>outlet.</b> In spaces that were far away from the <b>floor</b> supply <b>outlet,</b> the ventilation performance of the FR system deteriorated. The performance of the TR system was found similar to the ceiling based system at far distance. The TR system was the most efficient one in removing smoke particles inside the whole room. The FR system removed particles in {{the lower part of the}} room better than the ceiling-based system. Improvements in particle concentration in the sitting person breathing level were achieved by the FR system...|$|R
40|$|Ventilation {{performance}} and pollutant distribution {{in a traditional}} ceiling-type ventilation system, a top-return (TR) -type and a floor-return (FR) -type underfloor ventilation systems were performed in a controlled experimental room. Tracer gas method was utilized to determine the age of air and the contaminant removal effectiveness. Tobacco smoke was also introduced to study the particle-phase pollutant distribution. The TR system delivered conditioned air more efficiently in the occupied zone and exhibited higher gaseous contaminant removal effectiveness. It also showed the lowest smoke particle concentration compared {{with the other two}} systems. The FR system showed better ventilation performance over the mixing system at the space that was close to the <b>floor</b> supply <b>outlet</b> and at the lower height level. The FR system was less effective than the TR system in removing buoyant tobacco smoke particles at {{the upper part of the}} room indicating its highly localized characteristics. Differences in experimental conditions between the present and the previous studies and their effects on the experimental results are discussed. In general, the experimental data suggested that both types of the underfloor ventilation systems have the potential of improving air quality at the breathing zone over the ceiling-based mixing system with suitable designs. © Indoor Air (2004) ...|$|R

40|$|The {{performance}} of indoor airflow {{for the office}} room with the hybrid air-conditioning system has been investigated by means of CFD analysis. The hybrid air-conditioning system is composed of under <b>floor</b> air supply <b>outlets</b> for task zone and the natural ventilation openings for ambient zone. The measured data (Kotani et al. 2006) at the office room in existence {{was used as the}} boundary condition of the flow rate of each natural ventilation opening and task flow outlets for CFD. To investigate the influence of location of the natural ventilation opening, two models with different location of openings for natural ventilation were made; one is the case with openings for natural ventilation under the ceiling (“ceiling-model”; Lim et al. 2007) and the other is the case with openings for natural ventilation near the window side (“counter-model”). It was made clear that the ceiling-model can supply the fresh air more widely to the occupancy zone than counter-model. Moreover, CFD analysis using ceiling-model was conducted to investigate the influence of the outdoor air condition (wind direction, wind velocity and outdoor temperature). As the results, the distribution of fresh air under the north wind is more uniform than that of the west wind. Under the west wind, SVE 4 of natural ventilation openings is highest in the west-side zone...|$|R

The present study was undertaken {{in order to provide}} an adequate data base to develop appropriate water management strategies for the Kaituna Valley and other similar catchments in the area. Shrinkage fractures within lava flows control the vertical movement of water whilst horizontal water flow occurs mainly within brecciated lava. Chemical and environmental water analysis indicate that local precipitation through volcanic fractures is the main mechanism for groundwater recharge in the area. The impermeable layers (tuff and ash) between lava flows and subvertical dikes divide the subsurface volcanic rocks into a number of groundwater compartments each with its own water level and outlets. Outlets will be into adjacent to the valley <b>floor</b> sediments. The <b>outlet</b> through the gravelly layer in this zone is the main mechanism of groundwater replenishment within the valley floor deposits. Geophysical investigations have identified two aquifers below the valley floor. The lower aquifer with an average transmissivity value of 4. 45 x 10 - 3 m 2 /s has a variable thickness ranging between 2 m to 60 m. the average transmissivity for the upper aquifer is 14. 5 x 10 - 3 m 2 /s with an average thickness of 24 m.
