500|$|In {{the early}} 1980s, the Smithsonian found {{that few of}} its 20 million annual {{visitors}} were of a racial minority despite the city's large black population, and created a committee to address the disparity. As the African art museum had not yet moved to the National Mall, it served a black constituency in a racially mixed neighborhood, with racially <b>integrated</b> <b>staff</b> and programming popular among local school groups with its regular films, folk stories, and lectures. The museum also offered workshops on African stripweave and talking drum. Patton, museum director in the mid-2000s, said that the museum was not well known in Washington, as only half of taxi drivers knew its location. Patton's tenure included shows targeted towards children. As a result, the museum briefly served more children than adults. Around this time, the museum held about 10 special events a year. The Washington Post wrote that the museum [...] "struggled ... to attract visitors and donations" [...] in 2016, which was exacerbated by the Cosby controversy.|$|E
