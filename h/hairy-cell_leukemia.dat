We {{report a}} 68 -year-old Indian {{man who was}} {{referred}} to the Hematology Unit for investigation for thrombocytopenia, an incidental finding during a pre-operative screening for prostatectomy.

More responses (70 - 80 %) are achieved in patients with chronic lymphoproliferative disorders treated de novo with CdA but their impact on survival remains to be established, More than 10 years after its first use in clinical practice, late adverse consequences of the severe and sustained immunosuppression induced by CdA have not been reported but should still be closely monitored...|$|E

40|$|Mantle-cell {{lymphoma}} comprises 2 %- 10 % of all non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs). Patients {{present with}} generalized disease, {{and have a}} poor prognosis. Three different histologic patterns (mantle zone, nodular, and diffuse) and three different cyto-logical variants (classical, blastic, and pleomorphic) have been described. The phenotype (strong surface IgM, CD 5 +, CD 10 -, CD 23 -, cyclin D 1 + and B-cell markers+) is remarkably con-stant. Dependent on the methods used (PCR, Southern blot analysis, and cytogenetics) a t(ll; 14) can be detected in approx-imately 35 %— 66 % of cases. Using FISH analysis, possibly almost all cyclin Dl-expressing MCLs carry this translocation, indicat-ing that {{a substantial part of}} these translocations are missed by conventional methods. This has been confirmed by DNA fiber FISH analysis by which the breakpoints could be accurately mapped over a 220 kb region centromeric of the cyclin Dl gene. Additional genetic abnormalities involve breakpoints and dele-tion at the 3 ' end of the cyclin Dl gene, numerical chromosomal aberrations, mutations in p 53, and deletions of pl 6. These may be associated with tumor progression. Owing to the transloca-tion t(ll; 14), the cyclin Dl gene is activated. At the RNA level, approximately 90 % of MCLs show overexpression. This cor-roborates immunohistochemistry on paraffin tissue sections. Since expression of cyclin Dl in normal lymphoid cells is very low to undetectable, and only <b>hairy-cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> and very few other B-cell lymphomas show expression, immunohistochemis-try for cyclin Dl provides an excellent marker for MCL.

The therapy was administered for a median of 16 weeks in the Italian study and 18 weeks in the U. S. study. Primary end points were the complete response rate (in the Italian trial) and the overall response rate (in the U. S. trial). Enrollment was completed (28 patients) in the Italian trial in April 2013 and is still open (26 of 36 planned patients) in the U. S. trial. RESULTS The overall response rates were 96 % (25 of 26 patients who could be evaluated) after a median of 8 weeks in the Italian study and 100 % (24 of 24) after a median of 12 weeks in the U. S. study. The rates of complete response were 35 % (9 of 26 patients) and 42 % (10 of 24) in the two trials, respectively. In the Italian trial, after a median follow-up of 23 months, the median relapse-free survival was 19 months among patients with a complete response and 6 months among those with a partial response; the median treatment-free survival was 25 months and 18 months, respectively. In the U. S. trial, at 1 year, the progression-free survival rate was 73 % and the overall survival rate was 91 %. Drug-related adverse events were usually of grade 1 or 2, and the events most frequently leading to dose reductions were rash and arthralgia or arthritis. Secondary cutaneous tumors (treated with simple excision) developed in 7 of 50 patients. The frequent persistence of phosphorylated ERK-positive leukemic cells in bone marrow at the end of treatment suggests bypass reactivation of MEK and ERK as a resistance mechanism.

40|$|Immunotoxins are {{proteins}} that contain a toxin {{along with an}} antibody or growth factor that binds specifically to target cells. Nearly all protein toxins work by enzymatically inhibiting protein synthesis. For the immunotoxin to work, it must bind to and be internalized by the target cells, and the enzymatic fragment of the toxin must translocate to the cytosol. Once in the cytosol, 1 molecule is capable of killing a cell, making immunotoxins {{some of the most}} potent killing agents. Various plant and bacterial toxins have been genetically fused or chemically conjugated to ligands that bind to cancer cells. Among the most active clinically are those that bind to hematologic tumors. At present, only 1 agent, which contains human interleukin- 2 and truncated diphtheria toxin, is approved for use in cutaneous T-cell lymphoma.

The cocultivation of normal cells with Mo-T cells resulted in the transformation of the normal cells as evidenced by the establishment of permanent cell lines.

An Epstein-Barr virus-transformed lymphoblast B-cell line established from peripheral blood cells of the patient Mo, designated Mo-B, also was found to be infected with HTLV-II. All HTLV-II-infected cells, including the Mo-B cells, were capable of transforming normal cells of T-cell phenotype by transmission of virus by cocultivation.

40|$|PURPOSE: Although {{survival}} {{has been}} studied for various subtypes of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL), {{there have been few}} comprehensive studies to quantify the prognosis, including all specific histologies. The effect of family history on survival in NHL has not been examined. METHODS: We used the Swedish Family-Cancer Database to estimate hazard ratios in NHL by histology and family history. RESULTS: Using diffuse centroblastic lymphoma as reference (HR 1. 0), patients with Waldenström's macroglobulinemia and <b>hairy-cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> had the best survival. Survival advantage was also noted among patients with lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and different kinds of follicular lymphomas. For T-cell lymphoma, mycosis fungoides showed a favorable prognosis.

A non-significant familial concordance of either good or poor survival was noted among family members when probands' prognosis was stratified by survival time. CONCLUSIONS: Our results provide quantitative prognosis data for patients with NHL according to specific histologies.

40|$|Human {{retroviral}} infections {{result in}} significant neoplastic diseases. Human T cell lymphotro-pic virus I (HTLV-I), {{the first human}} retrovirus to be discovered, {{is associated with the}} develop-ment of acute T cell leukemia with characteristic hypercalcemia and skin lesions after many years of chronic infection of CD 4 + cells. HTLV-I also produces myelopathy. A minor T cell immunode-ficiency occurs in HTLV-I acute T cell leukemia with associated strongyloidiasis and Pneumo-cystis carinii pneumonia. Human T cell lymphotropic virus II (HTLV-II) is found to be endemic in Amerindians and intravenous drug users (IVDUs) and has been linked to some cases of <b>hairy-cell</b> <b>leukemia.</b> HTLV-II infects the CD 8 + population, with significant cell-associated vire-mia.

Transformation-associated EBV latent membrane protein 1 (LMP 1) was detected in 13 (6 %) NHL, comprising 4 (4 %) high-grade B-cell, 8 (10 %) peripheral T-cell, and 1 non-B-cell, non-T-cell lymphomas. Anaplastic large-cell lymphoma of T-cell type was consistently LMP 1 -negative. EBV nuclear antigen 2 was demonstrated in only three (1 %) cases. Induction of replication as defined by expression of the immediate early BamHI Z leftward reading frame 1 (BZLF 1) protein was detected in five cases, but early (EA) and late (VCA and MA) lytic cycle antigens were only found in two cases and in one case, respectively.

40|$|Rituximab is a human/mouse {{chimeric}} {{monoclonal antibody}} that binds to the CD 20 antigen and is expressed at {{all stages of}} B-cell development. Rituximab has demonstrated efficacy as monotherapy and in combination with chemotherapy {{in the treatment of}} both indolent and aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL). Rituximab treatment results in rapid depletion of B-cells and this has led to the consideration of other B-cell disorders as candidates for rituximab therapy. Recent studies have demonstrated the efficacy of rituximab in a variety of such disorders, including chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL), post-transplant lymphoprollferative disorder (PTLD),Waidenstrom's macroglobulinemia (WM), multiple myeloma (MM), idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), <b>hairy-cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> (HCL) and cold agglutinin disease (CAD). In patients with CLL, increasing the dose and/or frequency of rituximab treatment has given improved response rates compared with the standard dose schedule used in NHL, and combination immunochemotherapy has yielded an overall response rate of 92 % (with a 60 % complete response rate). Clinical trials have also demonstrated evidence of efficacy for rituximab in PTLD, WIVI and relapsed or refractory ITP.

We have used mAb and polyclonal antibodies against an intracytoplasmic epitope on one of these polypeptides (previously identified in murine B cells as the product of the B cell specific mb- 1 gene) to study the distribution of the IgM-associated dimer in human cells. By immunocytochemical staining of normal and neoplastic B cells, we show that the human mb- 1 protein appears early in B cell differentiation, probably before expression of cytoplasmic mu-chain, and persists until the plasma cell stage, where it is seen as an intracytoplasmic component. According to immunohistologic analysis of reactive lymphoid tissue and lymphoma samples, mb- 1 protein is completely B cell specific. Anti-mb- 1 also labels B cell areas in tissues from seven different mammalian species. Finally, the Ig-associated dimer could be isolated from human <b>hairy-cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> cells in high purity and yield by affinity chromatography using anti-mb- 1 antibody.

Tartarate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) test was done to detect HCs and electron microscopy was done to demonstrate initial ultrastructural changes and alterations following cladribine therapy. Results: Fifteen cases of HCL, aged 32 - 57 years (median 47 years) were studied. The clinical presentation included splenomegaly in 15 (100 &#x 0025;), fever in 10 (67 &#x 0025;), hepatomegaly and pain abdomen in eight (53 &#x 0025;), fatigue in nine (60 &#x 0025;) cases. The commonest laboratory features were monocytopenia in 13 (87 &#x 0025;), neutropenia in 12 (80 &#x 0025;), anemia in 10 (67 &#x 0025;) and pancytopenia in nine (60 &#x 0025;). All patients showed symptomatic improvement on cladribine therapy. Electron microscopy after treatment (three months) showed loss of the finger like projections, characteristic bald lymphocytes, loss of ribosomal lamellar complexes, as well as decrease in mitochondria and vacuoles. Conclusions: Indian patients with HCL are younger. Cladribine is an effective therapy for these patients and leads to complete response in most of the patients. There is a significant improvement in the ultrastructural features following cladribine therapy...|$|E
40|$|The heterodimeric protein complex {{recognized}} by the human mucosal lymphocyte 1 (HML- 1) monoclonal antibody is expressed on 95 % of intraepithelial lymphocytes but on only 1 - 2 % of peripheral blood lymphocytes [Cerf-Bensusson, N., Jarry, A., Brousse, N., Lisowska-Grospierre, B., Guy-Grand, D. & Griscelli, C. (1987) Eur. J. Immunol. 17, 1279 - 1285]. We purified the smaller HML- 1 subunit (105 kDa under nonreducing conditions) from <b>hairy-cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> cells and determined the N-terminal amino acid sequence of this chain. The 17 residues determined were identical to the deduced amino acid sequence encoded by an integrin beta 7 cDNA clone [Yuan, Q., Jiang, W. -M., Krissansen, G. W. & Watson, J. D. (1990) Int. Immunol. 2, 1097 - 1108]. Biochemical analysis of the larger HML- 1 subunit (175 kDa under nonreducing conditions) suggested {{that it was a}} distinct member of the cleaved group of integrin alpha chains, which we designated alpha E. The beta 7 chain also was associated with the integrin alpha 4 subunit, suggesting that the HML- 1 antigen (alpha E beta 7) and alpha 4 beta 7 constitute a beta 7 integrin family on mucosal lymphocytes. Interestingly, regulation of the expression of the HML- 1 antigen was reciprocal to that of lymphocyte function-associated molecule 1 in the presence of transforming growth factor beta 1. We suggest that these beta 7 integrins may play a specific role in mucosal localization or adhesion and that the expression of the HML- 1 antigen might be regulated by transforming growth factor beta 1 produced at or near epithelial tissues...|$|E
40|$|Background: <b>Hairy-cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> (HCL) is a {{well-defined}} clinicopathological entity whose underlying genetic lesion is still obscure. Methods: We searched for HCL-associated mutations by performing massively parallel sequencing {{of the whole}} exome of leukemic and matched normal cells purified from the peripheral blood of an index patient with HCL. Findings were validated by Sanger sequencing in 47 additional patients with HCL. Results: Whole-exome sequencing identified five missense somatic clonal mutations that were confirmed on Sanger sequencing, including a heterozygous mutation in BRAF that results in the BRAF V 600 E variant protein. Since BRAF V 600 E is oncogenic in other tumors, further analyses were focused on this genetic lesion. The same BRAF mutation was noted in all the other 47 patients with HCL who were evaluated by means of Sanger sequencing. None of the 195 patients with other peripheral B-cell lymphomas or leukemias who were evaluated carried the BRAF V 600 E variant, including 38 patients with splenic marginal-zone lymphomas or unclassifiable splenic lymphomas or leukemias. In immunohistologic and Western blot studies, HCL cells expressed phosphorylated MEK and ERK (the downstream targets of the BRAF kinase), indicating a constitutive activation of the RAF-MEK-ERK mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in HCL. In vitro incubation of BRAF-mutated primary leukemic hairy cells from 5 patients with PLX- 4720, a specific inhibitor of active BRAF, led to a marked decrease in phosphorylated ERK and MEK. CONCLUSIONS; The BRAF V 600 E mutation was present in all patients with HCL who were evaluated. This finding may have implications for the pathogenesis, diagnosis, and targeted therapy of HCL.

40|$|Thi s {{article is}} the first in a two-part series. ABSTRACT: Interferons are {{proteins}} with antiviral, antiproliferative, and immune-regulating activity. They are classified as alfa, beta, or gamma on the basis of antigenicity and biologic properties. Alfa interferons as single-agent therapy produce clinical improvement in approximately 90 percent of patients with <b>hairy-cell</b> <b>leukemia,</b> and up to 70 percent of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) in early-stage disease. Prolonged suppression or elimination of the leukemic cell clone by interferon may ultimately increase survival of patients with CML. Interferon is not effective single-agent therapy for multiple myeloma, but improves response rate when combined with conventional agents. AIDS-associated Kaposi's sarcoma demonstrates a 40 percent objective response rate to interferon, with less risk of immune system suppression than conventional cytotoxics. Other applications of a 1 fainterferon include malignant melanoma and renal cell carcinoma. Beta interferon is similar to the alfa subtype and may have utility in treatment of brain tumors. Gamma interferon is an important immune regulator with qualitative and quantitative differences in its efficacy and toxicity when compared with alfa interferon. Dlep Ann Pharmacother 1990; 24 : 761 - 8. THE HUMAN IMMUNE SYSTEM has long been recognized as a defense against invasion by infectious organisms. It is only in the last few decades, however, that an understanding of the immune system's great value in destroying cancerous cells has begun to unfold. Genetic engineering techniques have permitted large-scale production of immunologic cell products for use in clinical trials. Responses, sometimes dramatic and enduring, have been produced in tumors not responsive to conventional treatments. Although the ulti-mate role of immunotherapy in cancer treatment is still unknown, it is certain that the role will be significant...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of a shorter method of performing platelet kinetic studies with respect to the conventional 8 - 9 -day approach. Methods: We studied 41 patients (28 women, 13 men; mean age 52 yr) with primary idiopathic trombocytopenic purpura (IIP) (n = 20), secondary IIP (n = 9), HCV associated thrombocytopenia (n = 9), splenectomy (n = 1) and <b>hairy-cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> (n = 1). The patients were in a steady-state of platelet turnover. Initial platelet counts ranged from 19 to 302 x 109 /liter (mean value = 83). Platelet survival times (PST) were measured from the blood radioactivity disappearance curve of 111 ln-oxine-labeled autologus platelets following the recommenda tions of the International Committee for Standardization Â¡nHaema-tology: blood samples were taken at 30 min and 2 and 4 hr and thereafter daily for 7 days. PST was calculated by the weighted mean method and ranged from 18 to 219 hr (mean value = 98). PST was also calculated using only the data collected at 2, 48 and 96 hr. If the radioactivity in the blood at 96 hr exceeded 10 % of the 2 -hr value, the additional point at 168 hr was used. Results: By using this reduced dataset, we obtained a correlation of r = 0. 97 with the PST obtained from the whole dataset. In 24 patients, the difference was between Â± 10 hr and exceeded 1 day in only 4. Conclusion: About 94 % of the data may be recovered with only three or four blood samples and the duration may be shortened to 4 days in a significant proportion of patients (48 % of ITP patients). This ap proach offers the advantages of increased patient throughput, compliance and reduced examination costs. Key Words: platelet survival time; indium- 111 -oxine; agreement analysi...|$|E
40|$|Between January 1991 and January 1994, 40 {{patients}} with <b>hairy-cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> (HCL), 30 males and 10 females, {{with a median}} age of 54 years, were treated with a single course of 2 -chlorodeoxyadenosine (2 -CdA) at a dose of 0. 1 mg/kg/day continuous infusion for 7 days. Thirteen patients were untreated and 27 had previously received alpha-interferon. Thirty out of 40 patients (75 %) achieved complete remission (CR) and 10 (25 %) partial remission (PR). The median follow-up duration for patients in CR has been 48 months (range 30 - 66). Five of the complete responders (17 %) relapsed at 12, 24, 26, 30 and 36 months after treatment as documented by the increase of hairy cells (Hc) in the bone marrow and two of them, who were retreated with 2 -CdA after showing an initial impairment of peripheral blood values, obtained a second CR. The remaining three relapsed patients were never retreated and still show normal peripheral counts after 30, 38 and 40 months. Twelve of the continuous complete responder patients are still in CR after more than 5 years. In contrast, 8 out of 10 partial responders progressed after 8 - 36 months {{and all of them}} were retreated with 2 -CdA at a dose of 0. 15 mg/kg/day for 5 days i. v. Four of them (50 %) achieved a CR, three a better PR and one patient died 6 months after the second 2 -CdA course because of infectious complications. Two additional patients, both in CR, died after 28 and 37 months because of a second neoplasm. Toxic side-effects consisted of febrile episodes recorded in 16 patients: in seven of them, fever lasted only 24 - 48 h after the end of treatment and was apparently not infection-related. In the remaining nine patients, showing in addition severe neutropenia (neutrophils less than 1. 0 x 10 (9) /l), fever was related to bacterial infection requiring systemic antibiotics in all of them and G-CSF in three cases. In conclusion, 2 -CdA induces a very high proportion of complete and long-lasting remissions in {{patients with}} HCL. In a number of cases relapse at bone marrow level may not affect peripheral blood values for prolonged time. However, in those patients with initial pancytopenia a retreatment with 2 -CdA is still effective in inducing a durable second CR...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objective. It {{has been}} widely {{demonstrated}} that one single 7 -day course continous infusion (c. i.) 2 -chlorodeoxyadenosine (2 -CdA) at a dose of 0. 1 mg/kg daily is dramatically effective in inducing high and prolonged complete remission (CR) rates in patients with <b>hairy-cell</b> <b>leukemia</b> (HCL). However, 2 -CdA administration often results in severe neutropenia and lymphocytopenia both responsible for the infectious complications observed in these patients. We previously reported preliminary data regarding the effectiveness and toxicity of a modified protocol of 2 -CdA administration (0. 15 mg/kg 2 hours infusion {{once a week for}} 6 courses) in 25 HCL patients. This treatment schedule produced a similar overall response rate compared to standard 2 -CdA regimen and appeared to be followed by a lower incidence of infectious episodes. In the present study we report response rate and toxicity of weekly 2 CdA administration in a larger cohort of patients and with a longer follow-up. Design and Methods. In a group of HCL patients with a pronounced decrease in neutrophils count (< 13109 /L), we modified the standard protocol (0. 1 mg/kg daily 3 7 days c. i.) by administering 2 -CdA at a dose of 0. 15 mg/kg 2 hours infusion once a week for 6 courses. Thirty HCL patients, 24 males and 6 females with a median age of 56 years (range 37 - 76), entered into this protocol. Seventeen out of 30 patients were at diagnosis while the remaining 13 had been previously treated with a-interferon (a-IFN) (7), or 2 -CdA (4) or deoxycoformycin (DCF) (2). Results. Overall, 22 / 30 (73 %) patients achieved CR and 8 (27 %) partial remission (PR) with a median duration of response at the time of writing of 35 months, ranging from 6 to 58 months. Five patients (1 CR and 4 PR) have so far progressed. The treatment was very well tolerated. Five out of 30 patients (16 %) developed severe neutropenia (neutrophils < 0. 53109 /L) and only in two of them we did register an infectious complication which required treatment with systemic antibiotics and granulocyte colonystimulating factor (G-CSF). Interpretation and Conclusions. In conclusion, we confirm that weekly administration of 2 -CdA at a dose of 0. 15 mg/kg for 6 courses appears to be very effective in HCL inducing a high CR rate, similar to that observed with daily c. i. administration. CR durability and relapse/progression rates are also comparable to standard 2 -CdA schedule. Moreover this new regimen seems to be safer in pancytopenic patients, markedly reducing life-threatening infectious complications...|$|E
