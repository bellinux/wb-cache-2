50|$|Such a {{consideration}} led Odum to ask two important methodological questions: 1) What is the electrical {{significance of a}} function observed in nature? 2) Given an <b>electrical</b> <b>unit</b> in a circuit, what is it in the ecological system?

50|$|The {{choice of}} <b>electrical</b> <b>unit</b> for the base unit in a rationalized system depends only on {{practical}} considerations, particularly {{the ability to}} realize the unit accurately and reproducibly. The ampere rapidly gained support over the ohm, as many national standards laboratories were already realizing the ampere in absolute terms using ampere balances. The International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) adopted the Giorgi system with the ampere replacing the ohm in 1935, and this choice of base units is often called the MKSA system.|$|E

5000|$|A {{conventional}} <b>electrical</b> <b>unit</b> (or conventional unit {{where there}} is no risk of ambiguity) is a unit of measurement in the field of electricity which is based on the so-called [...] "conventional values" [...] of the Josephson constant and the von Klitzing constant agreed by the International Committee for Weights and Measures (CIPM) in 1988. These units are very similar in scale to their corresponding SI units, but are not identical because of their different definition. They are distinguished from the corresponding SI units by setting the symbol in italic typeface and adding a subscript [...] "90" [...] - e.g., the conventional volt has the symbol V - as they came into international use on 1 January 1990.|$|E
50|$|In 1901 Giorgi {{published}} {{a proposal for}} building a coherent set of units based on four base units - the metre, kilogram, second and one <b>electrical</b> <b>unit</b> (ampere, volt or ohm). In 1921 the Convention was extended to permit the promotion of standards relating to any physical quantity which greatly increased {{the scope of the}} CIPM's remit and implicitly giving it freedom to exploit Giorgi's proposals. The 8th CGPM (1933) resolved to work with other international bodies to agree standards for electrical units that could be related back to the international prototypes. This was agreed in principle by the International Electrotechnical Commission at its congress in Brussels in 1935 subject to the choice of the fourth unit being agreed with, amongst others, the appropriate consultative committee of the CIPM.|$|E
50|$|By lap 42, Kimi Räikkönen {{started to}} {{experience}} engine problems {{which turned out}} to be an issue with his kinetic <b>electrical</b> <b>unit.</b> This led to a loss in power which allowed the lapped Fernando Alonso to overtake him and Nico Rosberg to close in as well. One lap later, Nico Hülkenberg lost his front wing without evident reason. After the race, the kerbs of the Hungaroring were blamed for the malfunction, which sent Hülkenberg into the tyre barriers in turn one. The Virtual Safety Car was deployed, leading to both Mercedes cars pitting instantly, while both Ferrari cars did the same one lap later. By that time, the actual safety car was sent out on track to lead the field through the pit lane while marshals cleaned up pieces of Hülkenberg's front wing that littered the front straight, leading the field until the end of lap 49.|$|E

Since 1954 the CIPM committee that oversees the definition of units of measurement, the Consultative Committee for Units, has representatives from many international organisations including the ISR, IEC and ISO under the chairmanship of the CIPM.|$|R
5000|$|The {{conventional}} <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> are [...] "quasi-natural" [...] in {{the sense}} that they are completely and exactly defined in terms of fundamental physical constants. They are the first set of measurement units to be defined in this way, and as such, represent a significant step towards using [...] "natural" [...] fundamental physics for practical measurement purposes. However, the conventional <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> are unlike other systems of natural units in that some physical constants are not set to unity but rather set to fixed numerical values that are very close (but not precisely the same) to those in the common SI system of units.|$|R
5000|$|The only {{significant}} international {{use of the}} meridional definition of the metre, apart from Méchain and Delambre's original survey, was the initial work conducted by the British Association for the Advancement of Science (B.A.) on <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> which was {{to lead to the}} International System of <b>Electrical</b> and Magnetic <b>Units.</b> It was often claimed that the international <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> formed a coherent set of absolute units in the quadrant-eleventh-gram-second system (aka [...] "QES system" [...] or [...] "Q.E.S. system"), where the unit length was the quadrant of the Earth's polar circumference, the unit mass was the [...] "eleventh-gram" [...] or 10−11 grams and the unit time was the second. Nevertheless, the precision of absolute electrical measurements {{in the late nineteenth century}} was not such that the 0.02% difference in the definitions of the metre had any practical significance.|$|R
5000|$|The Jarvik-7 was a {{mechanical}} device, made of polyurethane and aluminium, {{which was used}} to replace the two ventricles of a human heart.The pumping action came from air, compressed by an <b>electrical</b> <b>unit</b> located outside of the patient's body. The human-made organ had two separate ventricles grafted with Dacron sleeves to the native atria and great vessels. It was powered by a 400-pound (180 kg) air compressor, connected to the heart, through a tube {{coming out of the}} patient body. In order to give the patients the ability to move, it was also invented a portable power console which {{was the size of a}} briefcase. Since 1982, 350 patients have used the Jarvik-7 heart model, and its original design is still used for the modern Jarvik-7, although due to propriety passages the device name is now [...] "SynCardia". On October 2004, the Jarvik-7 model was the first medical device to receive a full-FDA approval.|$|E
5000|$|Although the eudiometer's {{invention}} {{is usually}} credited to Marsilio Landriani, {{it was truly}} pioneered by Count Alessandro Volta (1745-1827), an Italian physicist who {{is well known for}} his contributions to the electric battery and electricity. Aside from its laboratory function, the eudiometer is also known for its part in the [...] "Volta pistol". Volta invented this instrument in 1777 for the purpose of testing the [...] "goodness" [...] of air, analyzing the flammability of gases, or to demonstrate the chemical effects of electricity. Volta's Pistol had a long glass tube that was closed at the top, like a eudiometer. Two electrodes were fed through the tube and produced a spark gap inside the tube. Volta's initial use of this instrument concerned the study of swamp gases in particular. Volta's pistol was filled with oxygen and another gas. The homogeneous mixture was taped shut with a cork. A spark could be introduced into the gas chamber by electrodes, and possibly catalyze a reaction by static electricity, using Volta's electrophorus. If the gases were flammable, they would explode, and increase the pressure within the gas chamber. This pressure would be too great and eventually cause the cork to become airborne. Volta's pistol was made with either glass or brass, however due to the electricity the glass was vulnerable to exploding. Volta's extensive studies on measuring and creating high levels of electric currents caused the <b>electrical</b> <b>unit,</b> the volt, to be named after him.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} methods were used to {{administer}} the shocks. A common method, chosen to maximize pain and distress, was to use electrodes fixed to particularly sensitive parts of the victim's body {{for the duration of}} the torture session. In another method, a wire is fixed to the victim and a wire with a bare end or an electrode with a wooden insulating handle is moved around to touch different sensitive parts of the body in turn, so as to cause a current to flow through the body between the two electrodes. For a male, the fixed wire was wrapped around his penis head or was replaced by a conducting wire mesh bag that fit snugly over the penis and testicles. They would also insert a thin metal rod into his urethra. For a female, it was attached to an electrode - either a short metal rod or, for better electrical contact, a moistened steel wool pan scrub - and this electrode was inserted into her vagina. Other methods include metal clamps attached to the nipples, labia and clitoris of the women. The clamps would be plugged into an <b>electrical</b> <b>unit</b> and the voltage increased over time. The torturer then touches the second electrode to different places on the body, such as the feet, legs, torso, neck, mouth, nipples, penis head, breasts and clitoris. This caused excruciating pain, at both the place where the second electrode touched the body and in the penis or vagina of the victim. Damage was often caused where the movable electrode was applied close to the point where the fixed electrode had been placed. It also caused intense pain and violent muscle contractions. Typically the person being tortured was kept blindfolded to add to the sense of helplessness as it was impossible to predict where and when the moving electrode would next be touched to the body. This type of torture would continue for long periods of time, often over days and weeks.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, in 1875, the Treaty of the Metre passed {{responsibility}} for verification of the kilogram and metre against agreed prototypes from French to international control. In 1921, the Treaty {{was extended to}} include all physical quantities including <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> originally defined in 1893.|$|R
50|$|Tonne of oil {{equivalent}} {{should be used}} carefully when converting <b>electrical</b> <b>units.</b> For instance, BP's 2007 report used a factor of 38% efficiency (the average efficiency of OECD thermal generating units in 2006), or roughly 16 GJ per toe, when converting kilowatt-hours to toe.|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, {{the numerical}} {{value of the}} Planck constant depends on the system of units used to describe it. Its value in SI units is known to 12 parts per billion but its value in atomic units is known exactly, {{because of the way}} the scale of atomic units is defined. The same is true of conventional <b>electrical</b> <b>units,</b> where the Planck constant (denoted h90 to distinguish it from its value in SI units) is given bywith KJ-90 and RK-90 being exactly defined constants. Atomic <b>units</b> and conventional <b>electrical</b> <b>units</b> are very useful in their respective fields, because the uncertainty in the final result does not depend on an uncertain conversion factor, only on the uncertainty of the measurement itself.|$|R
