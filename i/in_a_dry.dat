5|$|Dolbadarn Castle {{comprises}} a courtyard, {{surrounded by}} a number of towers and a round keep. The castle is built from purple and green slate stone, mainly constructed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> stone fashion without mortar, {{with the exception of the}} keep. The courtyard follows the natural shape of the hill and is protected by a curtain wall; originally perhaps 15feet (5m) high, it is now only at most 3feet (1m) high. Of the castle buildings, only the keep remains to any significant height.|$|E

5|$|At the September 11 Battle of Brandywine, the 4th Virginia Brigade stubbornly {{resisted}} {{the advance of}} General Charles Cornwallis, but was ultimately forced to retreat. Following the British victory, Howe marched toward Philadelphia, stopping briefly at Germantown. Scott persistently advocated for an attack on Howe's position at Germantown, and although he was initially in the minority among Washington's generals, he ultimately prevailed upon Washington to conduct the attack. On October 4, 1777, the 4th Virginia attacked the British in the Battle of Germantown. Because of their circuitous route to the battle, however, the field was already covered by heavy smoke from muskets and a fire set by the British <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> buckwheat field when they arrived; eventually, they and the other colonial forces {{were lost in the}} smoke and retreated.|$|E
5|$|Greene {{was born}} in Apponaug, Rhode Island, one of nine {{children}} of Caleb and Sarah Robinson (Greene) Greene. His family had roots in the founding of Rhode Island and in the American Revolutionary War, including General Nathanael Greene, George's second cousin. Caleb was a financially shrewd ship owner and merchant, but the Embargo Act of 1807, which prohibited U.S. vessels from carrying goods to other countries, and the War of 1812 left his family in financial difficulties. Young George attended Wrentham Academy and then a Latin grammar school in Providence and hoped to attend Brown University there, but his impoverished father could not afford it, so he moved to New York City and found work <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> goods store on Pearl Street.|$|E
5|$|Microgale macpheei {{is known}} {{only from the}} cave of Andrahomana. Its past {{presence}} there, {{like that of the}} extinct rodent Hypogeomys australis, suggests formerly more mesic (wet) conditions around the cave, which is currently <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> area. In addition to M.macpheei, three other tenrecs have been described from subfossil material, but none are currently recognized as valid species; thus, M.macpheei is at present the only known Recently extinct tenrec species. However, there is a remnant patch of mesic forest near Andrahomana, where a population of M.macpheei may survive. Although no radiocarbon dating has been carried out on M.macpheei remains, bones of the rodent Macrotarsomys petteri from layers in the same cave deposit bracketing those where M.macpheei was found yield dates of around 2480 and 1760 Before Present.|$|E

5|$|On 4 March 1907 Iéna {{was moved}} into dry dock No. 2 in the Missiessy Basin at Toulon to undergo {{maintenance}} of her hull {{as well as}} inspection of her rudder shaft. Eight days later, beginning at 1:35a.m. and continuing until 2:45, a series of explosions began in the port No. 5 100-millimetre magazine of Iéna which devastated the ship and the surrounding area. Because the ship was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> dock it was initially impossible to flood the magazines. The commanding officer of the battleship , which was moored nearby, fired a shell into {{the gate of the}} dry dock in an attempt to flood it, but the shell ricocheted without holing the gate. The dock was finally flooded when Ensign de Vaisseau Roux (who was killed shortly afterward by fragments from the ship) managed to open the sluice gates. The , moored in the No. 1 dock beside Iéna, almost capsized under the strength of the blasts.|$|E
5|$|Regardless of origin, {{climate and}} culture {{ultimately}} created the Arabian. The desert environment required a domesticated horse {{to cooperate with}} humans to survive; humans were the only providers {{of food and water}} in certain areas, and even hardy Arabian horses needed far more water than camels in order to survive (most horses can only live about 72hours without water). Where there was no pasture or water, the Bedouin fed their horses dates and camel's milk. The desert horse needed the ability to thrive on very little food, and to have anatomical traits to compensate for life <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> climate with wide temperature extremes from day to night. Weak individuals were weeded out of the breeding pool, and the animals that remained were also honed by centuries of human warfare.|$|E
5|$|Shen Kuo {{also made}} {{hypotheses}} {{in regards to}} geology and climatology in his Dream Pool Essays of 1088.

Shen also wrote that since petrified bamboos were found underground <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> northern climate zone where they had never been known to grow, climates naturally shifted geographically over time.|$|E

5|$|A {{cylinder}} boot is a {{hard rubber}} or plastic cover which fits over {{the base of a}} diving cylinder to protect the paint from abrasion and impact, to protect the surface the cylinder stands on from impact with the cylinder, {{and in the case of}} round bottomed cylinders, to allow the cylinder to stand upright on its base. Some boots have flats moulded into the plastic to reduce the tendency of the cylinder to roll on a flat surface. It is possible in some cases for water to be trapped between the boot and the cylinder, and if this is seawater and the paint under the boot is in poor condition, the surface of the cylinder may corrode in those areas. This can usually be avoided by rinsing in fresh water after use and storing <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> place. The added hydrodynamic drag caused by a cylinder boot is trivial in comparison with the overall drag of the diver, but some boot styles may present a slightly increased risk of snagging on the environment.|$|E
5|$|Above ground, American and Vietnamese {{soldiers}} who had escaped death or capture tried {{to escape from the}} North Vietnamese. From the team house, a group of four Americans and about 50 CIDG soldiers held a quick conference and decided that they would leave the camp through the northern perimeter, where there was no visible sign of the North Vietnamese. Without much difficulty, the Americans and the CIDG soldiers were able {{to make it through the}} barbed-wire barrier, but North Vietnamese soldiers on the eastern side of the camp had detected their movement and began firing on the group. Ultimately, only two Americans and about 10 Vietnamese soldiers managed to escape from the camp, taking refuge <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> creek bed that offered some cover and concealment. At around 03:30am, Willoughby made another request for the Marines at Khe Sanh to send reinforcements, but again his request was turned down.

5|$|Alongside his {{colleague}} Wei Pu, Shen planned {{to map the}} orbital paths of the Moon and the planets in an intensive five-year project involving daily observations, yet this was thwarted by political opponents at court. To aid his work in astronomy, Shen Kuo made improved designs of the armillary sphere, gnomon, sighting tube, and invented {{a new type of}} inflow water clock. Shen Kuo devised a geological hypothesis for land formation (geomorphology), based upon findings of inland marine fossils, knowledge of soil erosion, and the deposition of silt. He also proposed a hypothesis of gradual climate change, after observing ancient petrified bamboos that were preserved underground <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> northern habitat that would not support bamboo growth in his time. He was the first literary figure in China to mention the use of the drydock to repair boats suspended out of water, and also wrote of the effectiveness of the relatively new invention of the canal pound lock. Although Ibn al-Haytham (965–1039) was the first to describe camera obscura, Shen was the first in China to do so, several decades later. Shen wrote extensively about movable type printing invented by Bi Sheng (990–1051), and because of his written works the legacy of Bi Sheng and the modern understanding of the earliest movable type has been handed down to later generations. Following an old tradition in China, Shen created a raised-relief map while inspecting borderlands. His description of an ancient crossbow mechanism which he himself unearthed proved to be a Jacob's staff, a surveying tool which wasn't known in Europe until described by Levi ben Gerson in 1321.|$|E

Jackson was survived by two brothers and two sisters, and by his fourth wife, Terri, their daughter Brianna, and Aja, Jackson's stepdaughter. He was survived by his third wife Betty Bennett and their son Lindsey and daughter Alex. Jackson was survived by his second wife Ruth Davis who sang background vocals for Springsteen. He was also survived by his first wife Margaret who married him when they were both 21 years old. Margaret was with him when he started JANDS, and accompanied him to the U.S. when he went to work for Clair Brothers.|$|E
5|$|Many frogs {{are able}} to absorb water and oxygen {{directly}} through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus. Similar glands in tree frogs produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal frogs reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Others frogs have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water-conserving position. Some frogs may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss. Woodhouse's toad (Bufo woodhousii), if given access to water after confinement <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>dry</b> location, sits in the shallows to rehydrate. The male hairy frog (Trichobatrachus robustus) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs, giving it a bristly appearance.
