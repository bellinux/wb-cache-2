5|$|In {{the early}} 1990s, NASA {{initiated}} the Discovery Program, which {{was intended to}} be a series of low-cost scientific missions. In 1996, the program's study team recommended a mission to explore the asteroid belt using a spacecraft with an ion engine as a high priority. Funding for this program remained problematic for several years, but by 2004 the Dawn vehicle had passed its critical <b>design</b> <b>review</b> and construction proceeded.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{awarding}} of the contract, a preliminary <b>design</b> <b>review</b> {{was carried out in}} September 1972, followed by a critical <b>design</b> <b>review</b> in September 1976 after which the engine's design was set and construction of the first set of flight-capable engines began. Final review of all the Space Shuttle's components, including the engines, was conducted in 1979. The design reviews operated in parallel with several test milestones, initial tests consisting of individual engine components which identified shortcomings with various areas of the design, including the HPFTP, HPOTP, valves, nozzle and fuel preburners. The individual engine component tests were followed by the first test of a complete engine (0002) on March 16, 1977. NASA specified that, prior to the Shuttle's first flight, the engines must have undergone at least 65,000 seconds of testing, a milestone that was reached on March 23, 1980, with the engine having undergone 110,253 seconds of testing by the time of STS-1 both on test stands at Stennis Space Center and installed on the Main Propulsion Test Article (MPTA). The first set of engines (2005, 2006 and 2007) were delivered to Kennedy Space Center in 1979 and installed on , before being removed in 1980 for further testing and reinstalled on the orbiter. The engines, which were of the first manned orbital flight (FMOF) configuration and certified for operation at 100% rated power level (RPL), were operated in a twenty-second flight readiness firing on February 20, 1981, and, after inspection, declared ready for flight.|$|E

40|$|<b>Design</b> <b>reviews</b> {{are common}} {{educational}} practice in design disciplines, where students meet with instructors and other stakeholders {{to discuss the}} progress of a project they are engaged in. Such reviews are tightly coupled with project-based learning approaches in the design studio. A number of research studies have looked into various characteristics of instructor-student interactions during <b>design</b> <b>reviews.</b> In this study, we investigated the question-asking behavior of instructors, students and clients. We paid particular attention to high-level questions that relate to causal and generative reasoning. We analyzed 22 reviews involving six undergraduate industrial designers, who undertook design projects individually. We observed that the instructors and clients were not effective in modeling question asking behavior for the students during the reviews. We also observed that {{the structure of the}} reviews did not facilitate the desired behavior either. Consequently, we present a theoretical framework that proposes a more explicit structure for <b>design</b> <b>reviews,</b> deliberately addressing particular aspects of the design process. Ultimately, we suggest that instructors should be inquisitive about the students’ design approach, and that the students should take responsibility for reflectively articulating their design thinking and actions during <b>design</b> <b>reviews...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{much more}} cost {{effective}} to design an industrial plant upfront for optimum energy efficiency rather than retrofit an existing plant, yet typically design engineers and project managers {{continue to focus on}} capital costs, not lifecycle costs, often ignoring substantial energy savings potential over the 20 - 50 year plant life. An average of over 30 percent in annual energy spending relative to the business as usual design baseline was identified in four recent energy <b>design</b> <b>reviews</b> (EDR) for large industrial companies. Typically, energy audits identify energy cost savings of 5 - 10 percent of energy spending, thus demonstrating the much larger savings potential of energy <b>design</b> <b>reviews.</b> This paper will define an EDR, list the benefits, compare an EDR with Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design, describe the methodology, present case study results and lessons learned from four EDRs, and conclude with suggestions on how to incorporate energy <b>design</b> <b>reviews</b> in your organization...|$|R
