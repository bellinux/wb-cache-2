40|$|A set of fault {{location}} algorithms for underground medium voltage cables, two incipient fault detection schemes for distribution cables {{and a state}} estimation method for underground distribution networks are developed in this thesis. Two schemes are designed to detect and classify incipient faults in underground distribution cables. Based on the methodology of wavelet analysis, one scheme is to detect the fault-induced transients, and therefore identify the incipient faults. Based on {{the analysis of the}} superimposed fault current and negative sequence current in time domain, the other scheme is particularly suitable to detect the single-line-to-ground incipient faults, which are mostly occurring in underground cables. To verify the effectiveness and functionalities of the proposed detection algorithms, different fault conditions, various system configurations, real field cases and normal operating transients are examined. The simulation results have demonstrated a technical feasibility for practical implementations of both schemes. Based on the methodology of the <b>direct</b> <b>circuit</b> analysis, a set of location algorithms is proposed to locate the single phase related faults in the typical underground medium voltage cables. A large number of complex nonlinear equations are effectively solved to find the fault distance and fault resistance. The algorithms only utilize the fundamental phasors of three-phase voltages and currents recorded at single end, normally at substation. The various system and fault conditions are taken into account in the development of algorithms, such as effects of shunt capacitance, mutual effects of metallic sheaths, common sheath bonding methods and different fault scenarios. The extensive simulations have validated the accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. In order to extend the proposed {{fault location}} algorithms to underground distribution networks, a state estimation algorithm is developed to provide the necessary information for the location algorithms. Taking account of the complexity and particularity of cable circuits, the problem of the state estimation is formulated as a nonlinear optimization problem that is solved by the sequential quadratic programming technique. The simulation studies have indicated that the proposed fault location scheme incorporating with the state estimation algorithm can achieve good performance under different load and fault conditions...|$|E

40|$|Since the 1970 ?s {{concrete}} railroad ties {{have become}} more and more prominent in the railroad industry. Their improved durability and increased safety over traditional timber ties has paved the way for new and more efficient concrete ties to be developed. Prestressing with steel strands was a key design aspect in providing the strength the ties needed to overcome the tonnage seen in heavy haul lines spread across the United States and the world. A major flaw seen with these concrete ties is deterioration due to environment or fatigue loading under the connected rail. This deterioration can lead to a change in gauge of the track structure which can then cause derailment of trains. A second issue found in concrete ties that was not found in timber is the electrical conductivity. Timber is a highly insulating material while concrete possesses insulating and conductive properties based on the amount of moisture present. This is an issue because track structures use the steel rails to carry electrical signals to detect the presence of a train within a signaled block. During construction, the steel strands may come into contact with the embedded steel shoulders {{on both sides of the}} tie, therefore creating a <b>direct</b> <b>circuit</b> that needs to be insulated from the steel rails. Aramid fiber-reinforced polymer bars have shown promise, as an electrical non-conductive material, to fix the problem of false signaling due to electrical shorts. AFRP is a composite material made of Kevlar fibers bound in a polymer resin. This material has a tensile strength of approximately 200 ksi and has been investigated for use as a replacement for steel in such structures as concrete bridge girders and decks. The objective of this research is to design and test new concrete railroad ties utilizing AFRP as the prestressing material. Four of these ties were constructed and tested for strength following the guidelines provided by the American Railroad Engineering and Maintenance-of-way Association (AREMA). Bending tests at the rail seat section and center section of the tie were performed to prove strength adequacy, and electrical resistivity tests were performed to prove insulation from the current in the rails. The AFRP ties showed to have over twice the electrical resistance of their steel counterparts with 2. 42 M? of resistance compared to 1. 11 M?. The strength comparison proved inconclusive, for although the ties did not fail, they did not meet AREMA cracking requirements for strength. A major factor that was seen was in the method of testing AREMA provides, through improved testing procedures, AFRP shows to be very promising as a full replacement of steel as prestressing reinforcement for concrete railroad ties...|$|E
40|$|While much {{progress}} has been made in understanding the development, differentiation, and organization of the spinal motor system, the complex circuitry that is integrated to determine a motor behavior has yet to be fully understood. The activity of motor neurons is influenced by sensory feedback, excitatory and inhibitory interneurons, and supraspinal control from higher brain regions in the CNS. Descending pathways from the cortex and midbrain are involved in the control of voluntary motor output. This is made possible by their projections onto spinal interneurons and, to a degree that varies between species, directly onto motor neurons. However, the somatotopic organization and molecular diversity of supraspinal projection neurons, and the circuitry that underlies their contribution to motor output, remain incompletely understood. The evolutionary emergence of direct descending projections onto motor neurons has been considered to reflect a specialized level of organization for precise control of individual forelimb muscles. Unlike their polysynaptic counterparts, monosynaptic connections represent direct, unfiltered access to the motor neuron circuit. The <b>direct</b> <b>circuit</b> is thought to represent a neural specialization for the increase in fractionated digit movements exhibited by primates and humans. The progressive realization that rodents have a greater degree of manual dexterity than was previously thought has evoked renewed interest in the role of direct supraspinal projections in other mammalian species. Lesion studies in the rodent indicated that, of the two major supraspinal pathways involved in the control of voluntary movement, the rubrospinal tract had a greater role in control of distal forelimb musculature. However, the degree to which this reflected direct projections onto motor neurons was not clear. Earlier anatomical tracing studies in the rat indicated that there are close appositions between labeled rubrospinal axons and motor neurons projecting to intermediate and distal forelimb muscles. To confirm that these contacts correspond to synapses, I developed a viral tracing strategy to visualize projections from the midbrain. Using an established technique of high-magnification confocal imaging combined with co-localization of the rubrospinal synaptic terminal marker, vglut 2, I established the existence of monosynaptic connections from the ventral midbrain at the level of the red nucleus onto a restricted population of forelimb motor neurons at a single spinal level (C 7 -C 8) in the rodent. To determine whether the motor neurons that receive synaptic input correspond to specific motor pool(s), I first established a positional map of forelimb muscle motor pools in the cervical enlargement of the mouse spinal cord. A single motor pool, that which innervates the extensor digitorum muscle, appeared to be situated in the dense dorsolateral termination zone of rubrospinal ventral fibers. The extensor digitorum muscle plays a key role in digit extension and arpeggio movements during skilled reaching. Anterograde labeling of rubrospinal descending fibers combined with retrograde labeling of extensor digitorum motor neurons revealed a <b>direct</b> <b>circuit</b> from the red nucleus onto this population of motor neurons. Surprisingly, neighboring motor pools innervating digit flexor muscles did not receive rubrospinal inputs. Moreover, other modulatory inputs onto motor neurons, including corticospinal, proprioceptive, and cholinergic interneuron afferents did not distinguish between extensor and flexor digitorum motor neurons. My data therefore reveal a previously unrecognized level of motor pool specificity in the direct rubrospinal circuit. The identification of a small number of rubrospinal fibers that project onto extensor digitorum motor neurons suggested a considerable degree of heterogeneity between rubrospinal neurons. I therefore investigated the anatomical and molecular organization of subpopulations of rubrospinal neurons using retrograde labeling to identify subpopulations of rubrospinal neurons projecting, respectively, to cervical and lumbar levels of the spinal cord. Two rubrospinal populations could be identified within the red nucleus: a rostral population of intermingled cervical and lumbar projection neurons which express the Pou transcription factor Brn 3 a, and a caudal population containing segregated cervical and lumbar domains, which co-express Brn 3 a and a novel member of the C 1 q/TNF protein family, C 1 qL 2. Following laser capture microdissection and genetic profiling of these three populations, I identified and validated molecular correlates of the topographic domains within the rodent red nucleus. The transcription factors tshz 3 and mafB are expressed in the caudal cervical domain, whereas the chemokine fam 19 a 4 is restricted to the caudal lumbar domain. KitL is an axon guidance molecule that is expressed in both the rostral population and the caudal cervical population. Finally, I identified two genes, cxcl 13 and gpr 88, that characterize subpopulations within these topographic divisions. Although the functional role of these genes in the establishment of the rubrospinal circuit remains to be determined, the data reveal a high level of molecular heterogeneity within the red nucleus. I hypothesize that this diversity allows rubrospinal neurons to form circuits in a precise and specific manner during development. Overall, my data provide evidence for a novel organization within the rodent motor system in which direct projections from the rubrospinal tract onto motor neurons appear to control a very specific aspect of skilled movement: the stereotypic extension and separation of the digits in preparation for a task requiring digit manipulation. Identifying molecular correlates of the direct rubrospinal population is the logical next step in further understanding the specific circuitry that encodes descending motor commands. My results will provide a basis for the dissection of the rubro-motoneuronal circuit, enabling the establishment of a direct link between neural connectivity and individual muscle control during a skilled movement...|$|E
40|$|Professors Currie and Goodman {{present a}} {{comprehensive}} {{analysis of the}} variables that must be isolated and weighed in determining the optimum forum for judicial review of administrative action. While the backdrop for {{this study is the}} caseload crisis presently confronting the federal courts of appeals, their discussion illuminates the requisites for optimum judicial review generally. Failing to perceive any compelling reason to single out administrative cases for review in separate courts, the authors argue against the creation of special administrative appeals courts. Even if such courts were to enjoy broad subject matter jurisdiction over the most demanding aspects of the agency review caseload, countervailing considerations, such as the danger of improper influence on the appointment process and the loss of the judges 2 ̆ 7 generalist perspective, outweigh the perceived benefits of uniformity, expertise and relief for the regional courts of appeals. As to the optimal forum within the present system of district courts and courts of appeals, the authors divide their discussion into three categories of agency action. With respect to formal agency determinations, the authors generally favor direct appellate court review, except where diversion to the district courts in the first instance is necessary to reduce an appellate workload which has grown to such proportions that it threatens the collegial nature of circuit court decisionmaking; and among two-tier systems, the authors suggest that discretionary appellate review be limited to areas generating a burdensome volume of appeals, involving issues or interests of relative insignificance and not bearing a potential for biased or misguided trial court decisions. Informal rulemaking, generally involving issues of legal importance which are likely to ultimately reach the courts of appeals in any event, is presumptively appropriate for direct appellate review. Despite the absence of a trial-type record, the courts of appeals will not have to engage in extensive factfinding, for any factual issues will increasingly be determined on the basis of materials before the agency, and any need for new factual information will be rare and obtainable by methods short of a judicial trial. In the case of informal. adjudication, however, the absence of a formal adjudicative record justifies a presumption in favor of initial district court review. Informal rulemaking is distinguished, for the issues arising from informal adjudication are likely to involve questions of specific fact, there is little guarantee of any meaningful record for review, and a larger proportion of such determinations are relatively unimportant and unlikely to be taken to the courts of appeals. The authors recognize that <b>direct</b> <b>circuit</b> court review may be appropriate if review is limited to reconstruction of the record before the agency and there is therefore no significant factfinding burden...|$|E
