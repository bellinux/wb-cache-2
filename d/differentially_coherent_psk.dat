It is shown that there exist realizations of the codes for both coherent and <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> <b>PSK</b> systems. Like binary maximal length sequences (BMLS) their generation and detection require circuits whose complexity grows aslog_ 2 (N), where N is the codelength.

By making linear approximations appropriate for high loop signal-to-noise ratio operation (the usual case of interest in tracking), it is demonstrated that the mean-square bit sync jitter of differentially detected GMSK system reveals striking similarities both qualitatively and quantitatively in comparison {{with that of a}} <b>coherent</b> <b>PSK</b> system...|$|R

40|$|A {{technique}} for combining equalization and <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> detection is proposed {{for use in}} wireless communication when carrier phase recovery is difficult. A decision-feedback <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> scheme, which generates an improved reference phase, is combined with a linear equalizer and the LMS algorithm is used to adapt the equalizer to an unknown channel. In addition, the proposed receiver is simulated for various two-dimensional signal constellations over multipath channels. It is shown that for high SNR, the degradation of this structure is negligible with respect to combined coherent detection and equalization. Therefore, this equalized <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> detection scheme can be used when carrier phase tracking (i. e. coherent detection) is difficult and intersymbol interference is a major obstacle...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Performance of {{differential}} phase-shift keying (DPSK) is considered for fading channels with nonnegligible time-variation, as well as signal or noise correlation between diversity branches. A <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> maximum-ratio combiner is derived, showing optimal weight dependence on the fading statistics. Bit error rate (BER) is evaluated analytically for Rayleigh fading, and comparison is made between the optimal and the equal-gain <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> combiner. The optimal combiner provides improvement in all situations, and reduces the error probability floor. Performance improvement is higher for higher Doppler spreads, with the exact amount depending on diversity correlation. For low diversity correlation, equal-gain combining performance stays close to optimal.

40|$|AbstractaCombining schemes of {{matched filter}} outputs for {{multiple}} slots are investigated {{in this paper}} for code acquisition in inter-cell asynchronous DS/CDMA systems. The optimal combining rule based on the maximum-likelihood criterion is derived for Rayleigh fading channels. Two combining schemes, a noncoherent combining and a coherent combining, {{are found to be}} merely extreme cases of the optimal combining. As a result of investigations on improved combining schemes, a novel <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> combining scheme is proposed.

40|$|Abstract—An {{adaptive}} equalization {{method is}} proposed {{for use with}} <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> detection of M-ary differential phase-shift keying (DPSK) signals {{in the presence of}} unknown carrier frequency offset. A decision-feedback or a linear equalizer is employed, followed by the <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> detector. The equalizer coefficients are adjusted to minimize the post-detection mean squared error. The error, which is a quadratic function of the equalizer vector, is used to design an adaptive algorithm of stochastic gradient type. The approach differs from those proposed previously, which linearize the post-detection error to enable the use of least mean squares (LMS) or recursive least squares (RLS) adaptive equalizers. The proposed quadratic-error (Q) algorithm has complexity comparable to that of LMS, and equal convergence speed. Simulation results demonstrate performance improvement over methods based on linearized-error (L) algorithm. The main advantages of the technique proposed are its simplicity of implementation and robustness to carrier frequency offset, which is maintained for varying modulation level.

40|$|This thesis {{provides}} a comprehensive {{analysis of the}} acquisition performance of the mobile-embedded Global Positioning System (GPS) receiver. Particular emphasis {{is given to the}} analysis of <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> processing techniques and parallel acquisition strategies. New analytical expressions for the distribution of the decision variable of <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> detectors are derived. In addition, new Gaussian approximations are derived and shown to be more accurate than existing approximations. Using these Gaussian approximations it is demonstrated that the traditional noncoherent combining detector is the best choice when the signal to noise ratio is large, but that <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> combining is a superior choice at low signal to noise ratios. An analysis of the effects of carrier Doppler, code Doppler and data modulation on detector performance is also conducted. For the noncoherent combining detector, new expressions are obtained for the mean and worst case power attenuation due to the combined effects of carrier Doppler and data modulation. Approximate expressions are also derived for the <b>differentially</b> <b>coherent</b> combining detector. New expressions are also obtained for the mean and variance of the time to first hit using a Markov chain model and matrix methods. These models permit the use of numerical techniques to determine the optimal choice of receiver parameters for a given performance requirement. Finally the effect of unknown power levels and multi-access interference (MAI) are considered. A novel technique for detecting MAI, referred to as the power level detector, is introduced and its performance analysed. All results are verified by Monte Carlo computer simulation using a simplified signal model. The simulations were implemented on a 100 processor computer cluster...|$|R

Ironically, our findings suggest that increasing the number of transmit antennas in a MIMO-aided CDMA system results in combining the low-energy, noise-contaminated signals of the transmit antennas, which ultimately increases the MAT by an order of magnitude, when the SINR is relatively low.
