5|$|The {{ubiquitin}} protein {{itself is}} 76 amino acids long {{and was named}} due to its ubiquitous nature, as it has a <b>highly</b> <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence</b> and is found in all known eukaryotic organisms. The genes encoding ubiquitin in eukaryotes are arranged in tandem repeats, possibly due to the heavy transcription demands on these genes to produce enough ubiquitin for the cell. It has been proposed that ubiquitin is the slowest-evolving protein identified to date. Ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues to which another ubiquitin can be ligated, resulting in different types of polyubiquitin chains. Chains in which each additional ubiquitin is linked to lysine 48 of the previous ubiquitin {{have a role in}} proteasome targeting, while other types of chains may be involved in other processes.|$|E
25|$|Class I has two <b>highly</b> <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence</b> motifs. It aminoacylates at the 2'-OH of a {{terminal}} adenosine nucleotide on tRNA, {{and it is}} usually monomeric or dimeric (one or two subunits, respectively).|$|E
25|$|Class II {{has three}} <b>highly</b> <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence</b> motifs. It aminoacylates at the 3'-OH of a {{terminal}} adenosine on tRNA, {{and is usually}} dimeric or tetrameric (two or four subunits, respectively). Although phenylalanine-tRNA synthetase is class II, it aminoacylates at the 2'-OH.|$|E

25|$|Structure: This {{particular}} domain is a trimer of single-stranded, left-handed beta-helices. These {{associate to}} form a nine-coiled left-handed beta-roll. It contains sequence motifs, of {{which there is a}} strong similarity with other TAA heads. This indicates {{that there is a lot}} of similarity when comparing protein structure.

25|$|RTA has rRNA N-glycosylase {{activity}} {{that is responsible for}} the cleavage of a glycosidic bond within the large rRNA of the 60S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. RTA specifically and irreversibly hydrolyses the N-glycosidic bond of the adenine residue at position 4324 (A4324) within the 28S rRNA, but leaves the phosphodiester backbone of the RNA intact. The ricin targets A4324 that is contained in a <b>highly</b> <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence</b> of 12 nucleotides universally found in eukaryotic ribosomes. The sequence, 5’-AGUACGAGAGGA-3’, termed the sarcin-ricin loop, is important in binding elongation factors during protein synthesis. The depurination event rapidly and completely inactivates the ribosome, resulting in toxicity from inhibited protein synthesis. A single RTA molecule in the cytosol is capable of depurinating approximately 1500 ribosomes per minute.|$|E
25|$|The common {{feature of}} all ABC {{transporters}} {{is that they}} consist of two distinct domains, the transmembrane domain (TMD) and the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). The TMD, also known as membrane-spanning domain (MSD) or integral membrane (IM) domain, consists of alpha helices, embedded in the membrane bilayer. It recognizes a variety of substrates and undergoes conformational changes to transport the substrate across the membrane. The sequence and architecture of TMDs is variable, reflecting the chemical diversity of substrates that can be translocated. The NBD or ATP-binding cassette (ABC) domain, on the other hand, {{is located in the}} cytoplasm and has a <b>highly</b> <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence.</b> The NBD is the site for ATP binding. In most exporters, the N-terminal transmembrane domain and the C-terminal ABC domains are fused as a single polypeptide chain, arranged as TMD-NBD-TMD-NBD. An example is the E. coli hemolysin exporter HlyB. Importers have an inverted organization, that is, NBD-TMD-NBD-TMD, where the ABC domain is N-terminal whereas the TMD is C-terminal, such as in the E. coli MacB protein responsible for macrolide resistance.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{members of}} the MMP family are {{organized}} into three basic, distinctive, and well-conserved domains based on structural considerations: an amino-terminal propeptide; a catalytic domain; and a hemopexin-like domain at the carboxy-terminal. The propeptide consists of approximately 80–90 amino acids containing a cysteine residue, which interacts with the catalytic zinc atom via its side chain thiol group. A <b>highly</b> <b>conserved</b> <b>sequence</b> ([...] [...]PRCGXPD[...] [...]) {{is present in the}} propeptide.

Nucleotide sequence analysis of 4. 8 kb of the predicted amino acids revealed significant homology to various peptide synthetases over the whole sequence and also revealed two amino acid-activating domains with <b>highly</b> <b>conserved</b> Core 1 to Core 6 and spacer motif.

5000|$|<b>Highly</b> <b>conserved</b> DNA <b>sequences</b> {{are thought}} to have {{functional}} value. The role for many of these <b>highly</b> <b>conserved</b> non-coding DNA <b>sequences</b> is not understood. Ultra-conserved elements or sequences (UCEs or UCRs, ultra-conserved regions) that share 100% identity among human, mouse and rat were first described by Bejerano and colleagues in 2004. One recent study that eliminated four <b>highly</b> <b>conserved</b> non-coding DNA <b>sequences</b> in mice yielded viable mice with no significant phenotypic differences; the authors described their findings as [...] "unexpected". Many regions of the DNA, including <b>highly</b> <b>conserved</b> DNA <b>sequences,</b> consist of repeated sequence elements. One possible explanation of the null hypothesis above is that removal of only one or a subset of a repeated sequence could theoretically preserve phenotypic functioning on the assumption that one such sequence is sufficient and the repetitions are superfluous to essential life processes; it was not specified in the paper whether the eliminated sequences were repeated sequences. Although most of the conserved sequences' biological function is still unknown, few <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> derived transcripts showed that their expression is deregulated in human cancer tissues.|$|R
50|$|Conservation of protein-coding {{sequences}} {{leads to}} the presence of identical amino acid residues at analogous regions of the protein structure and hence similar function.

40|$|The deduced {{amino acid}} {{sequence}} of Campylobacterjejuni Tet(O), cloned in Escherichia coli, has shown that it contains the five <b>highly</b> <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> of the GTP-binding domain found in other GTPases. Asn- 128 belongs to the G 4 motif of such a domain and is involved in hydrogen bonding with the guanine ring of the nucleotide. Substitution of Asn- 128 by 11 other amino acids resulted in a decrease in tetracycline resistance, indicating that tetracycline resistance conferred by Tet(O) is related to GTP binding. The effect of the mutations on the GTP-binding domain is discussed with the EF-Tu-GDP complex as a model. Guanine nucleotide-binding domains share local homolo-gies at the protein sequence level and are similar in their three-dimensional structure and interactions with GTP (2, 7, 11, 12). Many GTP-binding proteins have been identified, and the crystal structures of the two GTPases, EF-Tu and p 2 lras, have been determined (8, 12). Certain tetracycline resistance (Tcr) determinants have been identified, such as Tet(O) and Tet(M), which also possess the <b>highly</b> <b>conserved</b> <b>sequences</b> of the GTP-binding domain (15, 19, 24).
