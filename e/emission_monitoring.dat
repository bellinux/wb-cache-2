40|$|Acoustic <b>emissions</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{is a novel}} form of {{nondestructive}} testing by which the elastic waves that propagate through materials and structures are detected and observed. It allows previously unknown information about the material to be acquired and analyzed. Deformation events often cause a sudden change in a material?s stress field which is manifested as an elastic wave. <b>Monitoring</b> the <b>emissions</b> generated by deforming a material can lead to conclusions {{about the nature of}} its deformation that might otherwise go unseen. Acoustic activity varies based on the size, shape, and composition of the material, as well as the process by which the material is loaded. This study is an attempt to apply the methods of acoustic <b>emissions</b> <b>monitoring</b> to pipe dent tests, in which a dent is gradually induced into a steel pipeline segment. The purpose of these dent tests is to determine the critical strain at which the existence of a crack within the pipe is probable.

An ultrasonic acoustic <b>emissions</b> <b>monitoring</b> system was acquired and applied to three pipe dent tests carried out over the course of this study.

The need for aerial pollution monitoring system was urgent because local businesses were not (and still are) not honest about the pollution control practice: although every local business is forced to install Continuous <b>Emission</b> <b>Monitoring</b> System (CEMS, 烟气连续监测系统), they could and often turn off the system when release smog or other pollutants, and even destroy data in order to lower the amount emission to meet the quota, by simply claiming the equipment had malfunctioned. It {{was very difficult to}} catch such illegal acts because every CEMS is on site and there was simply not enough manpower to monitor every system. An alternative would be monitor the pollution emission from air, where businesses could not tamper with monitoring system, hence the UAV for environmental monitoring was born. Since 2012, SDAS had joined forces with Australian National University (ANU) to develop an UAV for pollution monitoring, with ANU providing assistance to develop the onboard monitoring system, and Chinese are responsible for the aerial platform itself. The resulting UAV is an octocopter with a pair of skids as landing gear, and only requires three to five square meters to take-off and land, and capable of monitor pollutants of size as small as PM 2.5.

40|$|The {{requirements}} for continuous <b>emission</b> <b>monitors</b> has changed significantly {{over the last}} ten years.

In addition, reporting regimes necessitate maximum availability.

40|$|Oxides of {{nitrogen}} (NOx), carbon monoxide (CO) and other combustion by-products of gas turbines {{have long been}} identified as harmful atmospheric pollutants {{to the environment and}} humans.

40|$|Thesis (M. Environmental Management) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2005. An {{evaluation}} of the VOC (Volatile Organic Compound) <b>emissions</b> <b>monitoring</b> system of Natref (National Refiners of South Africa) was conducted to determine {{the effectiveness of the}} system. Natref monitors fugitive plant equipment VOC emissions, VOC emissions from the wastewater treatment area and the tank farm as separate entities. The hiatus in the VOC <b>emissions</b> <b>monitoring</b> system is the absence of an overall VOC emission scenario at Natref. Data of VOC emissions from Natref's field data were used to determine the overall VOC emission scenario at the refinery. Since no control guidelines are available for VOC emissions in South Africa. it was necessary to with refineries in the USA and Western Europe to determine how effective Natref’s VOC <b>emissions</b> <b>monitoring</b> system is. The percentage VOC emissions at Natref from the three areas fell outside the benchmark ranges and different scenarios were simulated to determine the possible causes. The results of this evaluation brought to light inadequacies in the VOC <b>emissions</b> <b>monitoring</b> system at Natref and an estimated loss of approximately three million rand per annum due to VOC emissions. The absence of a coherent picture of VOC emissions at the refinery can lead to sub-optimal expenditure of resources to reduce VOC emissions. The value of a monitoring system lies therein that information obtained from {{it can be used to}} implement effective control measures in order to make a contribution to the protection of the environment and therefore towards sustainable development.

ChapmanThe {{increased}} <b>emissions</b> <b>monitoring</b> {{requirements of}} industrial gas turbines {{have created a}} demand for less expensive <b>emissions</b> <b>monitoring</b> systems. Typically, <b>emissions</b> <b>monitoring</b> is performed with a Continuous <b>Emissions</b> <b>Monitoring</b> System (CEMS), which <b>monitors</b> <b>emissions</b> by direct sampling of the exhaust gas. An alternative to a CEMS is a system which predicts emissions using easily measured operating parameters. This system {{is referred to as}} a Parametric <b>Emissions</b> <b>Monitoring</b> System (PEMS). A review of the literature indicates there is no globally applicable PEMS. Because of this, a PEMS that is applicable to a variety of gas turbine manufacturers and models is desired. The research presented herein includes a literature review of NOx reduction techniques, NOx production mechanisms, current PEMS research, and combustor modeling. Based on this preliminary research, a combustor model based on first-engineering principles was developed to describe the NOx formation process and relate NOx emissions to combustion turbine operating parameters. A review of available literature indicates that lean-premixed combustion is the most widely-used NOx reduction design strategy, so the model is based on this type of combustion system. A review of the NOx formation processes revealed four well-recognized NOx formation mechanisms: the Zeldovich, prompt, nitrous oxide, and fuel-bound nitrogen mechanisms. In lean-premixed combustion, the Zeldovich and nitrous oxide mechanisms dominate the NOx formation. This research focuses on combustion modeling including the Zeldovich mechanism for NOx formation. The combustor model is based on the Siemens SGT- 200 combustion turbine and consists of a series of well-stirred reactors. Results show that the calculated NOx is on the same order of magnitude, but less than the NOx measured in field tests. These results are expected because the NOx calculation was based only on the Zeldovich mechanism, and the literature shows that significant NOx is formed through the nitrous oxide mechanism. The model also shows appropriate trends of NOx with respect to various operating parameters including equivalence ratio, ambient temperature, humidity, and atmospheric pressure. Model refinements are suggested with the ultimate goal being integration of the model into a PEMS...|$|R
