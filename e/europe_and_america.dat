5|$|In {{addition}} to composing, Poulenc was an accomplished pianist. He was particularly celebrated for his performing partnerships with the baritone Pierre Bernac (who also advised him in vocal writing) and the soprano Denise Duval, touring in <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America</b> with each, and making many recordings. He {{was among the}} first composers to see the importance of the gramophone, and he recorded extensively from 1928 onwards.|$|E
5|$|Their work {{culminated in}} co-authoring of The Polish Peasant in <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America</b> (1918–20), {{considered}} a sociology classic. It was his collaboration with Thomas {{that marked the}} transition in Znaniecki's career from philosopher to sociologist. Znaniecki stayed with Thomas in Chicago until mid-1919, {{when he moved to}} New York, following Thomas, who had lost his job at Chicago due to a spurious scandal.|$|E
5|$|Znaniecki's {{most famous}} work remains The Polish Peasant in <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America</b> (1918–20), co-authored with William I. Thomas. His other major works include Wstęp do socjologii (An Introduction to Sociology, 1922), The Method of Sociology (1934), Social Actions (1936), The Social Role of the Man of Knowledge (1940) and Cultural Sciences (1952).|$|E

40|$|The {{advocacy}} coalition framework (ACF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} frequently applied theories of the policy process.

5|$|Goldfaden wandered Europe as a {{poet and}} journalist. His plays {{continued}} to be performed in <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America,</b> but rarely, if ever, did anyone send him royalties. His health deteriorated – a 1903 letter refers to asthma and spitting up blood – and he {{was running out of}} money. In 1903, he wrote Jacob Dinesohn from Paris, authorizing him to sell his remaining possessions in Romania, clothes and all. This gave him the money to head once more to New York in 1904.|$|E
5|$|In January 1985, {{production}} of Ran was halted as Kurosawa's 64-year-old wife Yōko fell ill. She died on February 1. Kurosawa returned {{to finish his}} film and Ran premiered at the Tokyo Film Festival on 31 May, with a wide release the next day. The film was a moderate financial success in Japan, but a larger one abroad and, {{as he had done}} with Kagemusha, Kurosawa embarked on a trip to <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America,</b> where he attended the film's premieres in September and October.|$|E
5|$|She {{published}} articles and books {{on her work}} and her lobbying {{was instrumental in the}} passage of several educational acts in the mid-nineteenth century. She was the first woman to have a paper published by the Statistical Society of London. She addressed many conferences and meetings and became {{known as one of the}} foremost public speakers of her time. Carpenter was active in the anti-slavery movement; she also visited India, visiting schools and prisons and working to improve female education, establish reformatory schools and improve prison conditions. In later years she visited <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America,</b> carrying on her campaigns of penal and educational reform.|$|E

5|$|There {{are three}} {{accounts}} of foreigners visiting Hawaii {{before the arrival}} of James Cook, in 1778. However, the earliest Western depictions of the isle, including Mauna Kea, were created by explorers in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. Contact with <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America</b> had major consequences for island residents. Native Hawaiians were devastated by introduced diseases; port cities including Hilo, Kealakekua, and Kailua grew with the establishment of trade; and the adze quarries on Mauna Kea were abandoned after the introduction of metal tools.|$|E
5|$|Florian Witold Znaniecki (15 January 1882– 23 March 1958) was a Polish {{philosopher and}} {{sociologist}} who taught and wrote in Poland {{and in the}} United States. Over {{the course of his}} work he shifted his focus from philosophy to sociology. He remains a major figure in the history of Polish and American sociology; the founder of Polish academic sociology, and of an entire school of thought in sociology. He won international renown as co-author, with William I. Thomas, of the study, The Polish Peasant in <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America</b> (1918–20), which is considered the foundation of modern empirical sociology. He also made major contributions to sociological theory, introducing terms such as humanistic coefficient and culturalism.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Korean War, {{a number}} of {{aircraft}} companies in both <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America</b> separately decided to investigate the prospective of vertical take-off and landing (VTOL) aircraft, which would eliminate the requirement for vulnerable runways by taking off and landing vertically as opposed to the conventional horizontal approach. In addition to military applications, the prospect of applying such technology to commercial airliners was also viewed with considerable interest by the mid 1950s, thus the value of developing viable vertical take-off systems was judged to be substantial. However, even during this era, few companies had envisioned that a VTOL aircraft would also be realistically compatible with the characteristics of high performance military aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Giselle {{was mounted}} by other ballet {{companies}} in <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America</b> {{almost immediately after}} its first night. The British had their first taste of Giselle with a drama based on the ballet called Giselle, or The Phantom Night Dancers by William Moncrieff, who had seen the ballet in Paris the same year. The play was performed on 23 August 1841 at the Theatre Royal, Sadler's Wells. The actual ballet was first staged in London at Her Majesty's Theatre on 12 March 1842 with Grisi as Giselle and Perrot as Albrecht. The dances were credited to Perrot and one Deshayes. This production was revived many times, once in 1884 with a Mlle. Sismondi {{in the role of}} Albrecht. This production, preceded by an operetta called Pocahontas, met with little enthusiasm.|$|E
5|$|I Am... Sasha Fierce debuted {{at number}} one on the US Billboard 200 chart with first-week sales of 482,000 units, earning Beyoncé her third {{consecutive}} US number-one solo album. The album earned over thirty platinum and one diamond certifications in separate worldwide markets, being certified double platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) on January 16, 2009, selling over three million copies in the United States. As of 2015, I Am... Sasha Fierce has sold over eight million copies worldwide. The album garnered seven Grammy Award nominations at the 52nd Annual Grammy Awards ceremony (2010), including a nomination for Album of the Year, winning five and eventually collecting a record setting six wins—the most awards won in one night by a female. To promote the album, Beyoncé made several award show and televised appearances across <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America,</b> and embarking on the worldwide I Am... World Tour (2009–10).|$|E

5|$|Polo was {{introduced}} into the area of Manipur state {{as early as the}} seventh century, and Manipuri ponies were one of the first breeds used in the game. The British learned of polo during the 19th century while watching it played on Manipuri ponies in India. The breed is still used for polo today in India, but other breeds are more popular in <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America.</b> Manipuri ponies are often also used to play sagol kangjei, a version of polo believed to be close to what was originally played when the sport was invented. Sagol kangjei is more demanding than modern polo, as ponies are used for the entire match instead of being changed between periods. Manipuri ponies are also used for racing. During their early history, they were in demand as cavalry horses, and men that rode these ponies were thought well-mounted. They continue to be in demand for military uses.|$|E
5|$|Second ending: Charles and Sarah have a rash sexual {{encounter}} in which Charles realises that Sarah was a virgin. Reflecting on his emotions during this, Charles ends his engagement to Ernestina, and proposes to Sarah through a letter. Charles's servant Sam fails {{to deliver the}} letter and, after Charles breaks his engagement, Ernestina's father disgraces him. His uncle marries and his wife bears an heir, ensuring {{the loss of the}} expected inheritance. To escape the social suicide and depression caused by his broken engagement, Charles goes abroad to <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America.</b> Ignorant of Charles' proposal, Sarah flees to London without telling her lover. During Charles' trips abroad, his lawyer searches for Sarah, finding her two years later living in the Chelsea house of the painter and poet Dante Gabriel Rossetti, where she enjoys an artistic, creative life. Sarah shows Charles the child of their affair, leaving him in hope that the three may be reunited.|$|E
5|$|At the time, the Hall Institute was in {{the early}} stages of rapid expansion. The new {{director}} of the Institute, Charles Kellaway, wanted to increase the activities of the organisation to not only support hospital operations but have separate research groups in physiology, microbiology and biochemistry that would also do independent studies. He also hoped to raise the standards to make the Institute comparable to the world-class operations in <b>Europe</b> <b>and</b> <b>America.</b> Kellaway took a liking to Burnet and saw him as the best young talent in the Institute with the ability to help raise it to world leading standards. However, he thought that Burnet would need experience working in a laboratory in England before he could lead his own research group on bacteriology in Australia. Burnet left Australia for England in 1925 and served as ship's surgeon during his journey in exchange for a free fare. On arrival, he took a paid position assisting the curator of the National Collection of Type Cultures at the Lister Institute in London. Burnet prepared or maintained bacteria cultures for other researchers in the morning and was free to do his own experiments in the afternoon. During the latter half of 1926, he experimented to see if Salmonella typhimurium was affected by bacteriophage.|$|E
