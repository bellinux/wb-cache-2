5|$|Homer, {{who still}} wants to party, rents an airboat and forces his family to come with him. He races through a swamp, accidentally killing the state's most famous {{resident}} and reptile – an alligator named Captain Jack, whom Marge, Maggie, Lisa, and Bart saw on a tour earlier while Homer made a fool of himself at the concert. A sheriff quickly arrives {{on the scene and}} despite the fact that Homer is the sole guilty culprit, the entire family is charged for killing the alligator. The family members flee from the sheriff and during a car chase they are hit by a train that pushes their car on the rail for several miles. When the Simpsons <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> the rail, they escape to a restaurant where they are given employment. They live in a nearby trailer and progressively turn into hillbillies. The sheriff eventually tracks them down and kidnaps them while they are sleeping. For their crimes (and Homer's foolish attempt at defending himself in court), the family is put into forced labor. One night when they are working at a party held by a judge in front of the capitol, tending to the guests (and failing to escape), Captain Jack strolls out of the capitol's doors. It turns out that he was never dead but rather knocked out. The family is acquitted, though they are banned from entering the state of Florida again (and several other states, excluding Arizona and North Dakota).|$|E
25|$|Long wait {{times are}} {{a symptom of}} another issue—quotas {{preventing}} immigrants from receiving immigrant visas. Georgia's Augusta Chronicle in 2006 stated that an estimated two million people are on waiting lists in anticipation to become legal and permanent residents of the United States. Immigrants need visas to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> these waiting lists, and Congress would need to change immigration law {{in order to accommodate}} them with legal status.|$|E

500|$|From 1992, Cobain and Novoselic would tune their guitars to E {{flat for}} studio and live {{performances}} (up until then, their live tunings were to concert pitch). Cobain noted, [...] "We play so hard we can't tune our guitars fast enough". The band made {{a habit of}} destroying its equipment after shows. Novoselic said he and Cobain created the [...] "shtick" [...] in order to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> the stage sooner. Cobain stated it began as an expression of his frustration with Chad Channing making mistakes and dropping out entirely during performances.|$|E
500|$|At the {{conclusion}} of the presidential election, the image of McCain was removed from the video. During her performance at Petco Park, Madonna [...] congratulated Barack Obama, on his historic win for presidency of the United States. Madonna stated, [...] "This is a historical evening. This is a motherfucking important evening and we are lucky to be sharing it with the World [...] This {{is the beginning of a}} whole new world. Are you ready?! Are you fucking ready?!" [...] The video screens displayed images of Obama along with the message, [...] "We Won". Madonna also publicly voiced her opposition for Republican Vice Presidential candidate for 2008, Sarah Palin. While performing on the tour, Madonna shouted [...] "Sarah Palin can't come to my party. Sarah Palin can't come to my show. It's nothing personal. [...] Here's the sound of Sarah Palin's husband's snowmobile when it won't start. (followed by a loud screeching noise)." [...] While performing [...] "I Love New York" [...] during the request section, the line [...] "Get off my street" [...] was replaced by Madonna screaming [...] "You know who can <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> my street? Sarah Palin! I'm gonna kick her ass if she don't <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> my street." [...] Then she mocked Palin's accent and told the crowd that she loves her.|$|E

[...] It was on an EP we called Over It that Victory Music had put out to [...] "test" [...] the waters. Since the song was really working at radio, our manager and label wanted us to also put it on our new album. We reluctantly agreed because we didn't want to blow any {{opportunities}} or ruin momentum for the band. It was a weird time. A friend of ours at the label called me one day and politely {{let me know that}} we were making a lot of mistakes with our career. We decided to fire our manager and try to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> Victory Music.|$|E

50|$|The {{symptoms}} of prairie madness {{were similar to}} those of depression. The women affected by prairie madness were said to show symptoms such as crying, slovenly dress, and withdrawal from social interactions. Men also showed signs of depression, which sometimes manifested in violence. Prairie madness was not unique from other types of depression, but the harsh conditions on the prairie triggered this depression, and it was difficult to overcome without <b>getting</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> the prairie.|$|R

The game was a classic, with Irons establishing himself as a punishing North-South runner. He ended the contest with 218 yards and one touchdown in an overtime loss to the Tigers.|$|R
60|$|We were careful, however, {{not to go}} on {{the bridge}} at times when a train might be {{expected}} to cross it, for when the cars passed us, we had much rather be on solid ground. But one day, when we had forgotten the hour; or a train was behind, or ahead of time; or an extra train was on the road--we were crossing this railroad bridge, and had just about reached the middle of it, when we heard the whistle of a locomotive! Looking up quickly, we saw a train, not {{a quarter of a mile}} away, which was coming towards us at full speed. We stood paralyzed for a moment. We did not know what to do. In a minute, or less, the train would be on the bridge and we had not, or thought we had not, time to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> it, whether we went forward or backward.|$|E
60|$|As {{there were}} yet {{several hours of}} light remaining, Roswell, still {{attended}} by Stimson, each armed with a sealing spear or lance, {{not only as a}} weapon of defence but as a leaping-staff, set out to climb as high up the central acclivity of the island as circumstances would allow him to go. He was deceived in the distances, however, and soon found that an entire day would be necessary to achieve such an enterprise, could it be performed at all; but he did succeed in reaching a low spur of the central mountain that commanded a wide and noble view of all that lay to the north and east of it. From this height, which must have been a few hundred feet above the level of the ocean, our adventurers got a still better view of the whole north coast, or {{of what might have been}} called the sealing quarter of the island. They also got a tolerably accurate idea of the general formation of that lone fragment of rock and earth, as well as of the islets and islands that lay in its vicinity. The outline of the first was that of a rude, and of course an irregular triangle, the three principal points of which were the two low capes already mentioned, and a third that lay to the northward and westward. The whole of the western or south-western shore seemed to be a nearly perpendicular wall of rock, that, in the main, rose some two or three hundred feet above the ocean. Against this side of the island in particular, the waves of the ocean were sullenly beating, while the ice drove up 'home,' as sailors express it; showing a vast depth of water. On the two other sides, it was different. The winds prevailed most from the south-west, which rendered the perpendicular face of the island its weather-wall; while the two other sides of the triangle were more favoured by position. The north side, of course, lay most exposed to the sun, everything of this nature being reversed in the southern hemisphere from what we have it in the northern; while the eastern or north-eastern side, to be precisely accurate, was protected by the group of islands that lay in its front. Such was the general character of Sealer's Land, so far as the hurried observations of its present master enabled him to ascertain. The near approach of night induced him now to hasten to <b>get</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> the somewhat dangerous acclivities to which he had climbed, and to rejoin his people and his schooner.|$|E

60|$|The {{excitement}} {{continued for}} fully half an hour. By {{that time it}} was ascertained that every one had <b>gotten</b> <b>off</b> <b>of</b> the ice or out of the water in safety. Those who had gone down were rushed to shelter, so that they might not catch cold. Gradually the crowd dispersed, and then Professor Brice had danger signs placed at various points on the ice, so that there should not be a repetition of the accident.|$|R
