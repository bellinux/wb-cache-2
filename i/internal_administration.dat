5|$|On 17 June 1936 all {{police forces}} {{throughout}} Germany were united, following Hitler's appointment of Himmler as Chief of German Police. With this appointment by the Führer, Himmler and his deputy, Heydrich, became {{two of the}} most powerful men in the <b>internal</b> <b>administration</b> of Germany. Himmler immediately reorganised the police into two groups: the Ordnungspolizei (Order Police; Orpo), consisting of both the national uniformed police and the municipal police, and the Sicherheitspolizei (Security Police; SiPo), consisting of the Geheime StaatsPolizei (Secret State Police; Gestapo) and Kriminalpolizei (Criminal Police; Kripo). At that point, Heydrich was head of the SiPo and SD. Heinrich Müller was the Gestapo's operations chief.|$|E

5|$|The {{struggle}} for power at the court had unfortunate consequences for both foreign affairs and for <b>internal</b> <b>administration.</b> All parties tried to satisfy the army {{in order to avoid}} interference in court affairs by leading commanders, and the military was given a free hand to pursue ever larger conquests. As long as the Gorkhas were invading disunited hill states, this policy—or lack of policy—was adequate. Inevitably, continued aggression led Nepal into disastrous collisions with the Chinese and then with the British. At home, because power struggles centered on control of the king, there was little progress in sorting out procedures for sharing power or expanding representative institutions. A consultative body of nobles, a royal court called the Assembly of Lords (Bharadari Sabha), was in place after 1770 and it had substantial involvement in major policy issues. The assembly consisted of high government officials and leading courtiers, all heads of important Gorkha families. In the intense atmosphere surrounding the monarch, however, the Assembly of Lords broke into factions that fought for access to the prime minister or regent, and alliances developed around patron/client relationships.|$|E
40|$|It is a {{recognised}} {{fact that}} university courses, especially those dealing {{with issues of}} quantitative literacy, can benefit enormously from exploitation of modern information and telecommunications technology (ITT). The use of ITT is advantageous both in the teaching process {{and in the process}} of <b>internal</b> course <b>administration,</b> enabling a simplified access to course materials, a steady electronic communication flow between lecturers and students, etc. Using the course on Business Statistics taught at the University of Ljubljana’s Faculty of Economics to second year students of business as an illustrative example, the paper focuses on discussion of student acceptance of ITT-supported teaching and <b>internal</b> course <b>administration.</b> In this framework, differences in characteristics of students more respectively less inclined to accept ITT-supported teaching and <b>internal</b> course <b>administration</b> are explored in detail with the help of multivariate data analysis. ...|$|R

5|$|The {{agreement}} drafted {{between the}} French and Malagasy governments did not clearly establish a French protectorate over the island, partly because recent French military setbacks in the Tonkin Campaign {{had begun to}} turn popular opinion against French colonial expansion. The Malagasy crown agreed to pay ten million francs to France to settle the dispute, a sum that was partly raised through the unpopular decision to increase fanampoana (forced labor in lieu of cash taxes) to mobilize the populace in panning for gold in the kingdom's rivers. This expense, coupled with Rainilaiarivony's removal of $50,000 in silver and gold coins from the tomb of Ranavalona I to offset the cost of purchasing arms {{in the run-up to}} the First Franco-Hova War, effectively emptied the royal treasury reserves. Capitalizing on Madagascar's weakened position, the French government then occupied the port town of Antsiranana and installed French Resident-General Le Myre de Vilers in Antananarivo, citing vague sections of the treaty as justification. The Resident-General was empowered by the French government to control international trade and foreign affairs on the island, although the monarchy's authority over <b>internal</b> <b>administration</b> was left unchallenged. Refusing to acknowledge the validity of the French interpretation of the treaty, Rainilaiarivony continued managing trade and international relations and unsuccessfully solicited assistance from the United States in maintaining the island's sovereignty. In 1894, the French government pressed Rainilaiarivony to unconditionally accept the status of Madagascar as a French protectorate. In response, Rainilaiarivony broke off all diplomatic relations with France in November 1894.|$|E

25|$|The new Secretary did {{not change}} the {{management}} system McNamara had installed at The Pentagon, {{and for the most}} part assigned <b>internal</b> <b>administration</b> to Deputy Secretary of Defense Paul H. Nitze. Clifford made no effort to depart from McNamara's policies and programs on such matters as nuclear strategy, NATO, and military assistance, but he favored the Sentinel anti-ballistic missile system, to which McNamara had given only lukewarm backing. Clifford wanted to deploy the system, and supported congressional appropriations for it. One important effect of Sentinel construction, he thought, would be to encourage the Soviet Union to enter arms control talks with the U.S. Indeed, before Clifford left office, the Johnson administration made arrangements for negotiations that eventually led to the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty of 1972.|$|E
25|$|In certain cases, as in India, {{the colonial}} power {{directed}} all decisions related {{to foreign policy}} and defense, while the indigenous population controlled most aspects of <b>internal</b> <b>administration.</b> This led to autonomous indigenous communities that were {{under the rule of}} local tribal chiefs or kings. These chiefs were either drawn from the existing social hierarchy or were newly minted by the colonial authority. In areas under indirect rule, traditional authorities acted as intermediaries for the “despotic” colonial rule, while the colonial government acted as an advisor and only interfered in extreme circumstances. Often, {{with the support of the}} colonial authority, natives gained more power under indirect colonial rule than they had in the pre-colonial period. Mamdani points out that indirect rule was the dominant form of colonialism and therefore most who were colonized bore colonial rule that was delivered by their fellow natives.|$|E
25|$|Sheldon {{called the}} {{officers}} sacked by Falkenhayn scapegoats; {{the survivors of}} the attacks of 1 July had to hang on until reserves arrived, who lost many casualties when sent to the most threatened areas. On the French front, a German regimental commander explained that the loss of Curlu, was caused by the regiment not being sent forward until the destructive bombardment had begun, that there was not enough material to build defences and that the accommodation of the troops was changed frequently. Night work became essential and a lack of rest reduced the efficiency of the troops, separation of the battalions of the regiment in the week before 1 July disrupted <b>internal</b> <b>administration</b> and the machine-gun detachments and infantry companies were attached to other units, which made it impossible to command the regiment as a tactical unit.|$|E
