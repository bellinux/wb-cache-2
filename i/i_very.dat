500|$|Historical sources offer wildly {{different}} and confused accounts {{as to who}} assassinated Archelaus I, although it likely involved a homosexual love affair with royal pages at his court. What ensued was a power struggle lasting from 399 to 393 BC of four different monarchs claiming the throne: Orestes, son of Archelaus I; Aeropus II, uncle, regent, and murderer of Orestes; Pausanias, son of Aeropus II; and Amyntas II, who was married to the youngest daughter of Archelaus <b>I.</b> <b>Very</b> {{little is known about}} this period, although each of these monarchs aside from Orestes managed to mint debased currency imitating that of Archelaus I.

500|$|Rose {{suggested}} that Murray's {{books on the}} witch-cult [...] "contain an incredible number of minor errors of fact or of calculation and several inconsistencies of reasoning". He accepted that her case [...] "could, perhaps, still be proved by somebody else, though <b>I</b> <b>very</b> much doubt it". Highlighting {{that there is a}} gap of about a thousand years between the Christianisation of Britain and the start of the witch trials there, he argues that there is no evidence for the existence of the witch-cult anywhere in the intervening period. He further criticises Murray for treating pre-Christian Britain as a socially and culturally monolithic entity, whereas in reality, it contained a diverse array of societies and religious beliefs. He also challenges Murray's claim that the majority of Britons in the Middle Ages remained pagan as [...] "a view grounded on ignorance alone".|$|E
500|$|Nimoy said Meyer {{gave the}} script [...] "the kind {{of humor and}} social comment, gadfly {{attitude}} <b>I</b> <b>very</b> much wanted".

I wanted people to really {{have a great time}} watching this film [...] if somewhere in the mix we lobbed a couple of big ideas at them, well, then that would be even better." [...] One of Meyer's earlier films, Time After Time, was largely based in San Francisco; when he was told by the producers that The Voyage Home had to be set in the same city, he took the opportunity to comment upon cultural aspects not covered by his earlier film, such as punk rock—The Voyage Homes scene where Kirk and Spock meet an annoying punk rocker was based on a similar scene cut from Time After Time.|$|E
500|$|Psychotronic {{movie is}} a term coined by film critic Michael J. Weldon—referred to by a fellow critic as [...] "the {{historian}} of marginal movies"—to denote the sort of low-budget genre pictures that are generally disdained or ignored entirely by the critical establishment. Weldon's immediate source for the term was the Chicago cult film The Psychotronic Man (1980), whose title character is a barber who develops the ability to kill using psychic energy. According to Weldon, [...] "My original idea with that word is that it's a two-part word. 'Psycho' stands for the horror movies, and 'tronic' stands for the science fiction movies. <b>I</b> <b>very</b> quickly expanded {{the meaning of the}} word to include any kind of exploitation or B-movie." [...] The term, popularized beginning in the 1980s with publications of Weldon's such as The Psychotronic Encyclopedia of Film and Psychotronic Video magazine, has subsequently been adopted by other critics and fans. Use of the term tends to emphasize a focus on and affection for those B movies that lend themselves to appreciation as camp.|$|E

[...] Following his contract announcement, Rosický scored an injury time equaliser in a 2–2 draw at Emirates Stadium against Everton. His third goal of the season came against Bolton, Rosický scoring Arsenal's first goal {{at the end of the}} first half after Bolton had taken an early two-goal lead. Arsenal went on to score three goals in the second half, winning the match 4–2. On 10 February, Rosický provided a cross for teammate Abou Diaby, who resultantly scored the solitary goal of their league match against Liverpool. Rosický finished the season with a total of three goals in 33 appearances in all club competitions.|$|E
