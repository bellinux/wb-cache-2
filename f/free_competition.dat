5|$|Both Braathens SAFE and SAS {{had been}} cross-subsidizing their routes. Through the regulations, the {{airlines}} {{had agreed to}} fly to unprofitable airports, in exchange for making higher profits on other routes. With <b>free</b> <b>competition,</b> {{this would not be}} followed, and the authorities announced the introduction of public service obligations on routes that were not profitable. To finance these, a NOK10 fee would be charged on all primary routes. The cost of collecting this fee was so high that SAS and Braathens SAFE announced it was cheaper to continue to fly to the unprofitable airports. Braathens SAFE stated that their routes Haugesund–Bergen and Oslo–Røros–Trondheim were not profitable.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} Gardermoen had a {{strategic}} impact on aviation in Norway. Despite the {{deregulation of the}} market in 1994, the lack of free slots at Fornebu made it impossible to have <b>free</b> <b>competition,</b> since no new airlines could establish themselves and no new international airlines could fly to Fornebu. Gardermoen allowed this to happen, and from 1 August 1998, Color Air started with flights from Oslo, pressing down prices on domestic routes. Although the airline went bankrupt the following year, the losses for Braathens were so high that it was taken over by SAS. The gap was then filled by Norwegian Air Shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Prior to a {{government}} report being presented on 30 March 1993, SAS had launched 1 November 1993 as their preferred date of <b>free</b> <b>competition,</b> while Braathens SAFE had launched 1 April 1997 as their preferred date. Braaathens SAFE was worried that the high debt the company had due to the purchase of new aircraft would make them illiquid in a price war. Bjørn G. Braathen stated {{that the company had}} bought the new aircraft {{based on the belief that}} deregulation would occur in 1997, giving the airline time to pay more of the debt. On 2 June 1993, with 76 against 18 votes, parliament voted to deregulate the domestic airline market from 1 April 1994. It was supported by the Labor, Conservative and Progress Party. With this, Norway became the third country in Europe to fully deregulate, after Sweden and the United Kingdom.|$|E

25|$|The {{aims of the}} {{directive}} are {{to create a more}} efficient rail network by creating greater competition. To achieve this aim member states are required to ensure that organisations operating the infrastructure (track, signalling etc.), and those operating services (trains) are separate and run on a commercial basis. Additionally railway companies from all member states are allowed to run services on any other member states rail infrastructure, both for passenger transport and goods. The <b>free</b> <b>competition</b> provided by the mandate is optional for regional and urban passenger trains.|$|E
25|$|The {{deregulation}} process, {{which would}} {{eliminate the need for}} concessions for routes, was driven by Norway's application for membership of the European Union. Since the airline's conception, Braathens SAFE had been a staunch opponent to the concession system and an avid proponent of <b>free</b> <b>competition</b> in the airline industry. With a deregulation around the corner, the airline change stands and warned against the consequences of a free market. In contrast, SAS embraced the new system. Braathens SAFE's main concern was that their high debt incurred after the purchase of the new aircraft would make them illiquid in a price war.|$|E

25|$|With the {{termination}} of NSB's and SJ's cooperation Linx on the Oslo–Stockholm route in January 2005, Ofotbanen announced {{they would be willing}} to take over operation of the route from the summer. However, SJ and NSB held monopolies on non-subsidized passenger trains services in their respective countries, and it would not be possible for a private company to operate the route. In May 2007, Ofotbanen announced its plans for the Oslo–Stockholm train, after necessary permissions had been granted from Norwegian and Swedish authorities, who decided to allow <b>free</b> <b>competition</b> on international routes. By then, SJ had already reopened its route on the line. In March 2008, plans had been launched to start operations in April, but Ofotbanen did not met the requirements to get a safety license from the inspectorates.

500|$|This section covers {{compliance}} of {{laws and}} regulations when obtaining a good or services from a vendor, supplier, or provider. The procurement requirement is established to ensure that such goods and services are obtained in an effective manner and in compliance laws and regulations, including the prohibition of conflicts of interest, the fair selection of vendors, provide open and <b>free</b> <b>competition</b> among vendors, etc. The suspension and debarment requirement establishes that certain non-federal entities have been prohibited from participating in or receiving federal assistance for various reasons, including prior mismanagement of funds or previous non-compliance {{of laws and}} regulations. This prohibition may be temporary (suspension) or indefinite (debarment; until specifically allowed by the government). When performing this purchase, the recipient must verify that the vendor, supplier, provider or their respective principals (e.g., owners, top management, etc.) are not suspended, debarred or otherwise excluded by the federal government. This is done by checking the [...] (EPLS) maintained by the General Services Administration or by contacting the federal agency.|$|E

While George Jewett had {{played for the}} Michigan football team in 1890 and 1892, the next African-American {{to play on the}} football team was Willis Ward, forty years later in 1932. During this period of athletic segregation, an African-American, Eugene Joseph Marshall, was permitted to compete in Trueblood's debate competitions and won the university debate championship in 1903. The Ann Arbor Argus reported: [...] "For {{the first time in the}} history of American universities, a colored man has won his highest honors in oratory in fair and <b>free</b> <b>competition</b> with all comers.

500|$|The social {{implications}} {{of the theory of}} evolution by natural selection also became the source of continuing controversy. Friedrich Engels, a German political philosopher and co-originator of the ideology of communism, wrote in 1872 that [...] "Darwin did not know what a bitter satire he wrote on mankind, and especially on his countrymen, when he showed that <b>free</b> <b>competition,</b> the struggle for existence, which the economists celebrate as the highest historical achievement, is the normal state of the animal kingdom." [...] Herbert Spencer and the eugenics advocate Francis Galton's interpretation of natural selection as necessarily progressive, leading to supposed advances in intelligence and civilisation, became a justification for colonialism, eugenics, and social Darwinism. For example, in 1940, Konrad Lorenz, in writings that he subsequently disowned, used the theory as a justification for policies of the Nazi state. He wrote [...] "...selection for toughness, heroism, and social utility... must be accomplished by some human institution, if mankind, in default of selective factors, is not to be ruined by domestication-induced degeneracy. The racial idea as the basis of our state has already accomplished much in this respect." [...] Others have developed ideas that human societies and culture evolve by mechanisms analogous to those that apply to evolution of species.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{attempts}} {{to explain how}} technological innovation can soften pressure and enlarge opportunity to gain the benefit of <b>free</b> market <b>competition.</b> The <b>free</b> market operation becomes uncertain {{in relation to the}} domestic affairs and global circumstances. The accelerated process of moving toward free market under a domestically worsening economic situation may backfire, while slowing it down becomes backward under the globally progressing free market circumstances. In dealing with the complexity of building up competitiveness under the pressure of <b>free</b> market <b>competition,</b> we propose a model; the so-called ‘adaptive innovation policy’. The model is drawn from the metaphor of living system and its environment. The adaptive innovation is continuous enrichment of technology as the nutrition of living economic system to evolve in gaining the benefit of <b>free</b> market <b>competition.</b> The simulation results from the model imply that: i) dealing with the complexity of <b>free</b> market <b>competition</b> requires understanding the behavior of multiple feedback inside the complex economic system; ii) spurring the economic growth by capital investment beyond the carrying capacity of market could bring about economic instability; iii...|$|R
