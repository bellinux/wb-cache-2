The military generator set uses an internal combustion diesel engine {{to drive a}} radial-gap permanent magnet alternator at variable speed. The speed of the engine is determined from a user selectable interface that for a given load and ambient thermal conditions controls the engine to run at its most efficient operating point. It is also possible to control the engine to run where it is most audibly quiet, at its least-polluting operating point, or at its most reliable, stiffest point such that it is less sensitive to load transients. The variable frequency, variable voltage produced by the permanent magnet alternator is diode-rectified to dc voltage, and an inverter is used to produce selectable frequency, controllable ac voltage. The power conversion system also incorporates a bi-directional dc-dc converter that can charge 24 V batteries {{that are used to}} start the IC engine and to power auxiliary loads.

40|$|Offshore {{oil and gas}} vessels {{operating}} in deep and ultra-deep waters demand larger and more sophisticated power and control systems. This tendency brings new challenges in integrated power system's design, especially for platforms/vessels requiring both dynamic positioning {{and high levels of}} redundancy. Voltage stability is essential in such systems, being in islanded operation (with related limited power generation) and with continuously changing load demands. In particular, voltage stability issues can arise due to the increasing amount of power electronic converters installed onboard, used to feed variable frequency drives and other electronic loads. Indeed, most of these have a controlled front-end, whose control can affect network voltage with a destabilizing effect named constant power loads (CPLs) instability. Such a behavior deserves special attention in islanded power systems, mostly if the quota of power electronics loads on the total installed power reaches very high values (up to the 85 % for new large all electric ships). This paper initially focuses on the CPL voltage instability. Two different models to assess voltage stability in marine systems with high penetration of <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> <b>conversion</b> are given, focusing on a design-stage assessment.

40|$|Multilevel {{converters}} {{are finding}} increased attention in industry and academia as the preferred choice of <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> <b>conversion</b> for high power applications. They {{have a wide}} application area {{in a variety of}} industries involving transportation and energy management, a significant portion of which comprises of multilevel inverter fed induction motor drives. Multilevel inverters are ideally suitable for high power drives, since the switching frequency of the devices is limited for high power applications. In low power drives, the switching frequency is often in the range of tens of kHz, so that switching frequency harmonics are pushed higher in the frequency spectrum thereby the size and cost of the filter are reduced. But higher switching frequency has its own drawbacks, in particular for high voltage, high power applications. They cause large dv/dt stress on the motor and the devices, increased EMI problems and higher switching losses. An engineering trade-o is thus needed to select the minimum switching frequency without compromising on the output voltage quality. The present work is an alternate approach in this direction. Here, new inverter topologies and PWM strategies are developed that can eliminate a set of harmonics in the phase voltage using 12 -sided polygonal space vector diagrams, also called dodecagonal space vector diagrams. A dodecagonal space vector diagram has many advantages over a hexagonal one. Switching space vectors on a dodecagon will not produce any harmonics of the order 6 n 1, (n=odd) in the phase voltage. The next set of harmonics thus reside at 12 n 1, (n=integer). By increasing the number of samples in a sector, it is also possible to suppress the lower order harmonics and a nearly sinusoidal voltage can be obtained. This is possible to achieve at a low switching frequency of the inverters. At the same time, a dodecagon is closer to a circle than a hexagon; so the linear modulation range is extended by about 6. 6 % compared to the hexagonal case. For a 50 Hz rated frequency operation, under constant V/f ratio, the linear modulation can be achieved upto a frequency of 48. 3 Hz. Also, the harmonics of the order 6 n 1, (n=odd) are absent in the over-modulation region. Maximum fundamental voltage is obtained from this inverter at the end of over-modulation region, where the phase voltage becomes a 12 -step waveform. The present work is developed on dodecagonal space vector diagrams. The entire work can be summarized and explained through Fig. 1. This figure shows the development of hexagonal and dodecagonal space vector diagrams. It is known that, 3 -level and 5 -level space vector diagrams have been developed as an improvement over 2 -level ones. They Figure 1 : Development of hexagonal and dodecagonal space vector diagrams have better harmonic performance, reduced dv/dt stress on the motor and devices, better electromagnetic compatibility and improvement of efficiency over 2 -level space vector diagrams. This happens because the instantaneous error between the reference vector and the switching vectors reduces, as the space vector density increases in the diagram. This is shown {{at the top of the}} figure. In the bottom part, the development of the dodecagonal space vector diagram is shown, which is the contribution of this thesis work. This is explained in brief in the following lines. Initially, a space vector diagram is proposed which switches on hexagonal space vectors in lower-modulation region and dodecagonal space vectors in the higher modulation region. As the reference vector length increases, voltage vectors at the vertices of the outer dodecagon and the vertices from the outer most hexagon is used for PWM control. This results in highly suppressed 5 th and 7 th order harmonics thereby improving the harmonic profile of the motor current. This leads to the 12 -step operation at rated voltage where all the 5 th and 7 th order harmonics are completely eliminated. At the same time, the linear range of modulation extends upto 96. 6 % of base speed. Because of this, and the high degree of suppression of lower order harmonics, smooth acceleration of the motor upto rated speed is possible. The presence of multilevel space vector structure also limits the switching frequency of the inverters. In the next work, the single dodecagonal space vector diagram is improved upon to form two concentric dodecagons spanning the space vector plane (Fig. 1). The radius of the outer dodecagon is double the inner one. It reduces the device rating and the dv/dt stress on the devices to half compared to existing 12 -sided schemes. The entire space vector diagram is divided into smaller sized isosceles triangles. PWM switching on these smaller triangles reduces the inverter switching frequency without compromising on the output voltage quality. The space vector diagram is further refined to accommodate six concentric dodecagons in the space vector plane (Fig. 1). Here the space vector diagram is characterized by alternately placed dodecagons which become closer to each other at higher radii. As such the harmonics in the phase voltage are reduced, in particular at higher modulation indices. At the same time, because of the dodecagonal space vector structure, all the 6 n ± 1, (n=odd) harmonics are eliminated from the phase voltage. A nearly sinusoidal phase voltage can be generated without resorting to high frequency switching of the inverters. The above space vector diagrams are developed using different inverter circuits. The first work is developed from cascaded combination of three 2 -level inverters, while the second and third works use 3 -level NPC inverters feeding an open end induction motor drive. The circuit topologies are explained in detail in the respective chapters. Apart from this, PWM switching schemes and detailed analysis on duty cycle calculations using the concept of volt-second balance are also presented. They show that with proper switching schemes, the proposed configurations can substantially reduce the overall loss of the inverter. Other operational issues like capacitor voltage balancing of 3 -level NPC inverters and improvement of input current drawn from the grid are also covered. All the above propositions are first simulated by MATLAB and subsequently verified by an experimental laboratory prototype. Motor current waveforms both at steady state and transient conditions during motor acceleration show that the induction motor can be fed from nearly sinusoidal voltage at all operating conditions. Simplified comparative studies are also made with the proposed converters and higher level inverters in terms of output voltage quality and losses. These are some of the constituents for chapters 2, 3 and 4 in this thesis. Additionally, the first chapter also covers a brief survey on some of the recent progresses made in the field of multilevel inverter. The thesis concludes with some interesting ideas for further thought and exploration...|$|E

40|$|MULTILEVEL {{inverters}} are {{the preferred}} choice of converters for <b>electronic</b> <b>power</b> <b>conversion</b> for high power applications. They are gaining popularity in variety of industrial applications including electric motor drives, transportation, energy management, {{transmission and distribution}} of power. A large portion of energy conversion systems comprises of multilevel inverter fed induction motor drives. The multilevel inverters are ideal for such applications, since the switching frequency of the devices can be kept low. In conventional two level inverters, to get nearly sinusoidal phase current waveform, the switching frequency of the inverter is increased and the harmonics in the currents are pushed higher in the frequency spectrum {{to reduce the size}} and cost of the filters. But higher switching frequency has its own drawbacks – in particular for medium voltage, high power applications. They cause large dv_/ dt stresses on the motor terminals and the switching devices, leading to increased electromagnetic interference (EMI) problems and higher switching losses. Harmonics in the motor currents can further be minimized by adopting dodecagonal voltage space vector (SV) switching (12 -sided polygon). In case of dodecagonal SV switching, the fifth and seventh order (6 n, 1, n = odd) harmonics are completely eliminated for the full modulation range including over modulation and twelve step operation in the motor phase voltages and currents. In addition to low order harmonic current suppression, the linear modulation range for dodecagonal SV switching is also more by 6 % when compared to that of the conventional hexagonal SV switching. The dodecagonal voltage SV structure is made possible by connecting two inverters with DC-link voltages Vd and 0 : 366 Vd on either side of an open-end winding induction motor. The dodecagonal space vector switching can be used to produce better quality phase voltage and current waveforms and overcome the problem of low order fifth and seventh harmonic currents and to improve the range for linear modulation while reducing the switching frequency of the inverters when compared to that of the conventional hexagonal space vector based inverters. This thesis focuses on three aspects of multilevel dodecagonal space vector structures (i) 	Two new power circuit topologies that generate a multilevel dodecagonal voltage space vector structure with symmetric triangles, (ii) A multilevel dodecagonal SV structure with nineteen concentric dodecagons, (iii) Pulse width modulation (PWM) timing calculation methods for a general N-level dodecagonal SV structure. (i) 	Two new power circuit topologies capable of generating multilevel dodecagonal voltage space vector structure with symmetric triangles with minimum number of DC link power supplies and floating capacitor H-bridges are proposed. The first power topology is composed of two hybrid cascaded five level inverters connected to either side of an open end winding induction machine. Each inverter consists of a three level neutral point clamped (NPC) inverter, cascaded with an isolated capacitor fed H-bridge making it a five level inverter. The second topology is a hybrid topology for a normal induction motor (star or delta connected), where the power is fed to the motor only from one side. The proposed scheme retains all the advantages of multilevel topologies as well the advantages of the dodecagonal voltage space vector structure. Both topologies have inherent capacitor balancing for floating H-bridges for all modulation indices including transient operations. The proposed topologies do not require any pre-charging circuitry for startup. PWM timing calculation method for space vector modulation is also explored in this chapter. Due to the symmetric arrangement of congruent triangles within the voltage space vector structure, the timing computation requires only the sampled reference values and does not require any iterative searching, oﬀ-line computation, look-up tables or angle estimation. Experimental results for steady state operation and transient operation are also presented to validate the proposed concept. (ii) 	A multilevel dodecagonal voltage space vector structure with nineteen concentric do-decagons is proposed for the first time. This space vector structure is achieved by connecting two sets of asymmetric hybrid five level inverters on either side of an open-end winding induction motor. The dodecagonal structure is made possible by proper selection of DC-link voltages and switching states of the inverters. In addition to that, a generic and simple method for calculation of PWM timings using only sampled reference values (v and v) is proposed. This enables the scheme to be used for any closed loop application like vector control. Also, a new switching technique is proposed which ensures minimum switching while eliminating the fifth and seventh order harmonics and suppressing the eleventh and thirteenth harmonics, eliminating the need for bulky filters. The motor phase voltage is a 24 -stepped waveform for the entire modulation range thereby reducing the number of switchings of the individual inverter modules. Experimental results for steady state operation, transient operation including start-up have been presented and the results of Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) analysis is also presented for validating the proposed concept. (iii) 	A method to obtain PWM timings for a general N-level dodecagonal voltage space vector structure using only sampled reference values is proposed. Typical methods that are used to find PWM timings for dodecagonal SV structures use modulation index and the reference vector angle, to get the timings T 1 and T 2 using trigonometric calculations. This method requires look-up tables and is diﬃcult to implement in closed loop systems. The proposed method requires only two additions to compute these timings. For multilevel case, typical iterative methods need timing calculations (matrix multiplications) to be performed for each triangle. The proposed method is generic and can be extended to any number of levels with symmetric structures and does not require any iterative searching for locating the triangle in which the tip of the reference vector lies. The algorithm outputs the triangle number and the PWM timing values of T 0, T 1 and T 2 which can be set as the compare values for any carrier based PWM module to obtain space vector PWM like switching sequences. Simulation and experimental results for steady state and transient conditions have been presented to validate the proposed method. A 3. 7 kW, 415 V, 50 Hz, 4 -pole open-end winding induction motor was used for the experimental studies. The semiconductor switches that were used to realize the power circuit for the experiment were 75 A, 1200 V insulated-gate bipolar transistor (IGBT) half-bridge modules (SKM 75 GB 12 T 4). Opto-isolated gate drivers with desaturation protection (M 57962 L) were used to drive the IGBTs. For the speed control and PWM timing computation a digital signal processor (DSP-TMS 320 F 28335) with a clock frequency of 150 MHz was used. For modulation frequencies 10 Hz and below, a constant sampling frequency of 1 kHz was used as the frequency modulation ratio is high. For modulation frequencies above 10 Hz, synchronous PWM strategy was used. The time duration Ts is the sampling interval for which the timings T 1, T 2 and T 0 are calculated. As in the case of any synchronous PWM method, the duration of sampling time (Ts) {{is a function of the}} fundamental frequency of the modulating signal. In this case, Ts = 1 _. fm • 12 n) sec. where fm is fundamental frequency in Hertz and ‘n’ is the number of samples per 30 ý dodecagonal sector. The PWM timings and the triangle data (from the DSP) is fed to field programmable gate array (FPGA) (SPARTAN XC 3 S 200) clocked at 50 MHz where the actual gating pulses are generated. The capacitor balancing algorithm and the dead-time modules were implemented within FPGA. No external hardware was used for generation of dead-time. The dead-time block generates a constant dead-time of 2 s for all the switches. Extensive testing was done for steady state operations and transient operations including quick acceleration and start-up to validate the proposed concepts. With the advantages like extension of linear modulation range, elimination of fifth and seventh harmonics in phase voltages and currents for the full modulation range, suppression of eleventh and thirteenth harmonics in phase voltages and currents, reduced device voltage ratings, lesser dv_dt stresses on devices and motor phase windings, lower switching frequency, inherent cascaded H-bridge (CHB) capacitor balancing, the proposed space vector structures, the inverter power circuit topologies, the switching techniques and the PWM timing calculation methods can be considered as viable schemes for medium voltage, high power motor drive applications...|$|E

This thesis attempts to provide a solution to these constraints through advancements in DC power architectures. 	Medium Voltage Direct Current (MVDC) infrastructure serves as a platform for the interconnection of renewable electric power generation, including wind and solar. Abundant loads such as industrial facilities, data centers, commercial office buildings, industrial parks, and electric vehicle charging stations (EVCS) can also be powered using MVDC technology. MVDC networks are expected to improve efficiency, through reductions in <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>conversion</b> steps and by serving as an additional layer between the transmission and distribution level voltage for which generation sources and loads could directly interface with smaller rated <b>power</b> <b>conversion</b> equipment. 	This thesis provides an introduction to battery energy storage system technology, and primarily investigates an EVCS powered via a MVDC bus. A bidirectional DC-DC converter with appropriate controls serves as the interface between the EVCS and the MVDC bus. Two scenarios are investigated for testing and comparing EVCS operation: 1) EVCS power supplied by the interconnected MVDC model and 2) EVCS power supplied by an equivalent voltage source. The ability of the battery charger (synchronous buck converter) to isolate faults in next generation DC power systems is explored. Each of the investigated components is modeled and simulated utilizing the PSCAD simulation environment then analytically validated. ...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAs {{aircraft}} installed {{electrical power}} continues to increase, maintaining the advantages of MEA approach highly relies {{on the ability to}} design low-weight on-board electrical network and <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>conversion</b> systems. However, design and integration of the power system still follow the legacy standards, where locally optimized individual components may not result in optimum system. This paper presents an attempt at exploring the advantages and barriers to integrated design where subsystem interactions are accounted for and the power system is optimized as a whole. As an example, the weight of a notional subsystem of the MEA electrical power system – consisting of a dc bus, a rectifier, an ECS, and an EMA – is studied and optimized {{as a function of the}} dc bus voltage, while taking into account the power quality, EMI, and stability constraints. Although the example follows a traditional (decoupled) design approach, the individual component modeling and design processes are formalized with similar structures, so that future system-level integrated design by optimization can be evaluated...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} calculating the energy saving amount due to {{regenerative}} braking implementation in modern AC and DC drives {{is of great}} importance, since it will decide whether this feature is cost effective. Although several works have been presented in this subject, they are concentrated {{on the case of}} electric vehicles because of the higher energy amounts or the need for more extended autonomy. However, the increase of the electric energy cost at the Hellenic industrial sector has emerged the need for advanced energy saving techniques in order to cut down operational costs. To this direction, this paper presents a theoretical, simulation and experimental investigation on the quantization of energy recovery due to regenerative braking application in industrial rotating loads. The simulation and the experimental processes evaluate the theoretical calculations, where it is highlighted that annual energy saving may become higher than 10 % even for small industrial loads, making the implementation of commercial regenerative braking units rather attractive. Finally, a <b>power</b> <b>electronic</b> <b>conversion</b> scheme is proposed for the storage/exploitation of the recovered energy amount. </p...|$|R
