5|$|The new {{legislation}} was <b>guaranteed</b> <b>by</b> the Russian Empire, giving it another excuse {{to interfere in}} the Commonwealth politics if the legislation it favored was changed.

5|$|Although Poniatowski {{protested the}} First Partition of the Commonwealth (1772), he was {{powerless}} {{to do anything}} about it. He considered abdication, but decided against it. During the Partition Sejm of 1773–1775, in which Russia was represented by ambassador Otto von Stackelberg, with no help forthcoming from abroad and the armies of the partitioning powers occupying Warsaw to compel the Sejm by force of arms, no alternative was available save submission to their will. Eventually Poniatowski and the Sejm acceded to the partition treaty; at the same time, several other reforms were passed. The Cardinal Laws were confirmed and <b>guaranteed</b> <b>by</b> the partitioning powers. Royal power was restricted, as the king lost the power to give out titles, and positions of military officers, ministers and senators, the starostwo territories, and Crown lands would be awarded through an auction. The Sejm also created two notable institutions: the Permanent Council, a main governmental body in continuous operation, and the Commission of National Education. The partitioners intended the Council to be easier to control than the unruly Sejms, and indeed it remained {{under the influence of the}} Russian Empire. Nevertheless, it was a significant improvement in the Commonwealth governance. The new legislation was <b>guaranteed</b> <b>by</b> the Russian Empire, giving it another excuse to interfere in Commonwealth politics if the legislation it favored was changed.|$|E

5|$|By {{the late}} 1960s, Sihanouk's {{delicate}} {{domestic and foreign}} policy balancing act was beginning to go awry. In 1966, an agreement was struck between the prince and the Chinese, allowing the presence of large-scale PAVN and Viet Cong troop deployments and logistical bases in the eastern border regions. He had also agreed to allow the use of the port of Sihanoukville by communist-flagged vessels delivering supplies and material to support the PAVN/Viet Cong military effort in South Vietnam. These concessions made questionable Cambodia's neutrality, which had been <b>guaranteed</b> <b>by</b> the Geneva Conference of 1954.|$|E

The family offered {{to give up the}} 2,000 shares and wipe out the debt, if the club relieved them of the bank loan guarantee.

5|$|Prince Norodom Sihanouk {{had ruled}} Cambodia adeptly {{since he had}} wrested {{independence}} from the French on 9 November 1953.

During the next ten years, while the conflicts in neighboring Laos and South Vietnam heated up, Sihanouk managed to sustain his delicate domestic political balance while at the same time maintaining his nation's neutrality (<b>guaranteed</b> <b>by</b> the 1954 Geneva Conference that ended the First Indochina War).|$|E
5|$|The Cardinal Laws, a quasi-constitution {{endorsing}} most of {{the conservative}} laws responsible for the inefficient functioning of the Commonwealth, were confirmed and <b>guaranteed</b> <b>by</b> the partitioning powers.

The passive electoral rights of the Orthodox and Protestants were diminished, with a restriction {{limiting the number of}} non-Roman Catholic Sejm deputies to three (one from Greater Poland, one from Lesser Poland, and one from the Grand Duchy of Lithuania).
