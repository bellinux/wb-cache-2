To realize this study, the DES approach is compared with a classical approach based on Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP). In order to compare these two modeling approaches, an evaluation system is proposed based on: (i) a problem instances generation system using the classical three-fields notation of Graham (alpha|beta|gamma), (ii) a measurement system based on three criteria and associated metrics: complexity, genericity and scalability. This system covers the most common problems when dealing with <b>flexible</b> <b>workshop</b> scheduling. The results obtained by {{the application of the}} method is finally discussed...|$|E

40|$|This report {{describes}} an innovative {{approach in the}} education of trainee psychiatrists in Queensland, Australia. Using a multidisciplinary panel with a central role of a consumer, together with an interactive facilitative workshop approach, a training package for schizophrenia was developed and refined, concentrating on the streams of (1) evidence-based treatments (2) modern psychiatry with a consumer centred and recovery oriented approach (3) sensitising trainees to ethical issues. A unique feature of this education approach is the way it brings together 2 paradigms: the dominant professional one with its scientific background, with the less dominant one of the body of knowledge in terms of consumer lived experience. This report describes how the multidisciplinary, multi-perspective group that comprised of this educational panel planned for and managed the inevitable tensions that arise when dominant preconceived beliefs are challenged. This ethical perspective stresses a non-paternalistic approach, informed by psychosocial factors but balanced by important principles regarding professional responsibility. The result has been an involving, richly complex and <b>flexible</b> <b>workshop</b> that has engaged successive cohorts of psychiatrist trainees in reflective discussion that varies according to individual need.

40|$|This is {{a master}} thesis about the Plant-in-the-box concept. The master thesis is to develop initial {{requirements}} and an initial layout to further investigate the concept. Plant-in-the-box {{in combination with the}} Vertical Workshop concept {{are a part of the}} “Digitalization @ PS”–Initiative, at Siemens, that started in October 2015 and forms a way of portable and <b>flexible</b> <b>workshops.</b> Plant-in-the-box is based on the idea to have a Additive Manufacturing, AM, machine with all its surrounding systems and equipment in a container which can easily be shipped to a new destination if desired. This AM container can then be combined with other containers containing anything from machinery for cutting processing to desktop stations and equipment for climate control. The set of containers are organized in a Vertical Workshop, where the containers can be slipped into a rack which supports the multi-storage workshop with accessibility and the necessary media. The Vertical Workshop can easily be deployed close to customer and as a part of a 3 DPrinter Cloud provide a network of  production units placed on strategic locations...|$|R

40|$|AI-ED’ 99 - Workshop on “Educational Robotics” The goal of {{educational}} robotics (ER) {{is to allow}} the acquisition of general skills in problem solving and scientific concepts in domains like experimental science and technology. ER involves uses of computers to acquire, analyze, control and model different physical worlds not reduced to screen simulation but with real device control. Pedagogical robots can be very different devices like a computer that controls a physical experiment, a modular micro-robot activated by computer or a <b>flexible</b> <b>workshop.</b> The educational strategies developed are those most often linked to theories of constructivism (constructionism – Seymour Papert), and refer to active pedagogy. Learning environments in ER offer {{the opportunity to take}} up an economic and educational challenge of enabling young children and also adults to adapt to new technologies and use them to solve problems in motivating activities. Interesting research to assist both learners and teachers is done in the ER context. New remote and collaborative applications are developed. This workshop is an opportunity to present and discuss advanced work in ER and above all to create links between the AI-ED community and the French-speaking ER community which have both been very active during the last few years. We think that each can help the other to make progress in such topics as cognitive development, collaboration, evaluation of systems, knowledge and skill acquisition, learning environments and microworlds, social and cultural aspects of learning, theories of teaching, distance learning...|$|E
40|$|ALamar is a {{satellite}} city of Havana. This city {{was built to}} be a soviet city which is designed for newman. But {{with the collapse of}} USSR, Alamar’s construction was stopped. This city become a bedroom community now. Local employment is so low and local people need defined public space to rebuild the identity. Alamar have its own opportunity though there won’t be any investment in the future. Alamar people build up this city by themselves during the microbragadas movement. Alamar people survived by their own hands during that special period. They build up informal sheds to make stuff for everyday life. They grow up organic vegetables to feed themselves. This tradition of craftsmanship can give alamar people a clear future and {{become a part of the}} city identity. A craftsmanship factory located in the city center can provide lots of jobs which can also be a public space (like a learning center) for local people. Through the typology study, the development of industrial building show there is three main part in industrial building, working space, logistic space, assistant space. Workshop usually need to be flexible to fit the future development and the change of the production process. Assistant space is the stable part of industrial buildings. Logistic space become more public now which can also be an exhibition space or study center. Through study of Aldo Rossi’s idea of stable form to a city and the development of Colosseum of Roma, a stable form which made by two thick concrete ‘wall‘ (include all the assistant primary space) can give the most strong identity to Alamar and face to the history and future with no change. In the central spine defined by the ‘wall‘ is the logistic and sharing wooden space which is designed for all Alamar people and workers. This includes restaurants, shop, exhibition, lecture, lessons, etc. On the two sides, steel frame make the <b>flexible</b> <b>workshop</b> which can be a showcase for the city. Complex Projec...|$|E

40|$|Children {{and youth}} often {{demonstrate}} resilience and {{capacity in the}} face of disasters. Yet, they are typically not given the opportunities to engage in youth-driven research and lack access to official channels through which to contribute their perspectives to policy and practice during the recovery process. To begin to fill this void in research and action, this multi-site research project engaged youth from disaster-affected communities in Canada and the United States. This article presents a <b>flexible</b> youth-centric <b>workshop</b> methodology that uses participatory and arts-based methods to elicit and explore youth’s disaster and recovery experiences. The opportunities and challenges associated with initiating and maintaining partnerships, reciprocity and youth-adult power differentials using arts-based methods, and sustaining engagement in post-disaster settings, are discussed. Ultimately, this work contributes to further understanding of the methods being used to conduct research for, with, and about youth.

This study was undertaken {{to evaluate the}} safety, usage pattern, and efficacy of fiber-optic sigmoidoscopy by evaluating the outcome of training {{and the results of}} procedures carried out by a group of primary care physicians. Of 1, 153 participants in one-day <b>flexible</b> sigmoidoscopy <b>workshops,</b> 764 (66 %) returned questionnaires evaluating their experiences following this training. Of these, 438 physicians had obtained a flexible sigmoidoscope, used it frequently, and had done a total of 17, 167 examinations. The average time of scope usage was nine months. Although additional supervised training was suggested {{at the time of the}} workshop, 68 % of physicians began doing flexible sigmoidoscopy without it. A total of 465 polyps and 153 cancers were detected by the study group for an overall detection rate of 2. 7 % for polyps and 0. 9 % for cancers. Four complications were reported. This study indicates that the technique of flexible sigmoidoscopy is readily learned, is diagnostically productive, and is reasonably safe in the hands of primary care physicians...|$|R
40|$|The {{willingness}} of older workers {{to participate in}} a retirement planning program served as an indicator of their anticipatory socialization toward retirement. Six independent variables were introduced in order to examine their effect on the workers 2 ̆ 7 attitude toward pre-retirement counseling (dependent variable). A path analysis revealed that intention to continue working after retirement had a significant negative effect on the dependent variable. The most significant positive effect was that of Educational Level. In the discussion of the findings it is shown that the desire of pre-retirees to continue working is interpreted as un-realistic anticipatory socialization, indicating their reluctance to assume alternative social roles. It is suggested that <b>flexible</b> retirement policies, <b>workshops,</b> educational programs and attractive leisure activities are necessary {{to meet the needs of}} older workers...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{project-based}} thesis work {{initiated by}} Nokia Research Center. The {{goal of this}} project is to investigate deformable user interfaces (DUIs) on mobile devices. Following background studies and identification of the research questions, various design methodologies were developed to encounter the new interaction style. An exploratory experiment was designed to study the role of form in DUI design. The purpose is to find insights from people’s instinct and tactile sense and to study dimensional properties on <b>flexible</b> materials. Another <b>workshop</b> was arranged so that experts in design and engineering experienced a whole design process for bridging form factors and applications with interaction. During the workshop, the context which is the detaching of touch interface users with the immediate environment was studied. Through these two activities, a set of design cues for deformable mobile devices was thus derived. The method of research through design has been the backbone of this thesis work. Numerous prototypes were implemented as physical representation of the hypotheses in each stage. At last, a working prototype was constructed. Consisting of a flexible mobile device and an information system, the prototype enables deformable interaction with information distributed in the space. A set of user test was conducted accordingly. Through these design activities, the role of form factors in mobile DUIs was examined. Moreover, {{it can be concluded}} that physical deformation in DUIs results in more engaging experiences than touch interfaces...|$|R

40|$|This thesis advocates digital {{storytelling}} as {{a geographical}} methodology {{to understand how}} emotion and affect are produced. Digital storytelling is a <b>flexible</b> and <b>workshopped</b> methodology that captures experimental, creative and imaginative performances of emotion and affect. Through digital storytelling geographers may build understandings of how emotion and affect are experienced individually and collectively. I use 11 digital storytelling workshops, with more than 100 participants, as the primary sites for my research. The workshops were conducted in the United States and New Zealand and were modelled on the practice established by the Center for Digital Storytelling in Berkeley, California, United States. It is argued that digital storytelling workshops co-create emotion, affect, people and place. Individual and group interviews, reflexive autobiographical journal writing, and digital storytelling workshop training, participation, and observing are used to access emotion and affect in digital storytelling workshops. A combination of qualitative research methods and critical social theories are used to highlight embodied, emotional and affectual geographies. Three findings frame my discussion. First, digital storytelling workshops are performative spaces for the staging and circulation of emotion and affect. The concepts of infrastructure, improvisation, and intimacy are critical for understanding the dynamic nature of emotion and affect in digital storytelling workshops. Second, a focus on relationality allows for an examination of psychotherapeutic practice and the transformative capacity of digital storytelling workshops. Workshop spaces are understood as ‘connective mediums’ in which a third position – {{the gap between the}} flow of emotions and the representation of that experience - is possible. Third, voice in digital storytelling is a political process of speaking and listening. A focus on voice permits an exploration of the acoustic politics of emotion and affect at individual and collective spatial scales. Digital storytelling workshops facilitate processes of seeing, hearing and experiencing emotion and affect as a way of interpreting the geographical worlds of research participants. The Center for Digital Storytelling’s model incorporates a commitment to social justice that honours and values emotional knowledge. As a practice-based research methodology digital storytelling requires researchers to be reflexive and negotiate their multiply layered ethical positionings. As geographers continue to experiment with innovative ways of conducting research, the messiness of digital storytelling can contribute to methodological debates about the ‘doing’ of emotion and affect in geographical research...|$|R

The Malaysian government encourages handicraft production {{as a full-time}} activity in dedicated workshops, {{but the vast majority}} of producers stay part-time and home-based. The aim of this research is to understand why so few producers switch to a greater level of commercialisation, despite government support. From the literature review, it is found that a combination of person-related and contextual factors influences small enterprise development and performance, but handicraft producers in a developing country context have different characteristics to the firms usually studied in entrepreneurship, so they may follow different development paths. Therefore, qualitative research was carried out (in-depth interviews with 16 handicraft producers), which aimed to understand deeply from the producers’ point of view how they made choices about their enterprises, and the factors that encouraged or inhibited their move to full-time status or workshop premises. It was found that interviewees perceived part-time domestic production to be convenient and <b>flexible,</b> and <b>workshop</b> production to be a big commitment, although factors such as level of perseverance and social networking were influential to these. In the interviews, a complicated relationship between status, premises and enterprise performance was also found. A face-to-face survey was then conducted of 210 handicraft producers in Sabah region, which aimed to test quantitatively the factors that influence producers’ status, premises and performance, and the relationships between them. Through cluster analysis, three groups of producers were identified: (i) ‘high performance full-timers’, (ii) ‘part-time professionals’ and (iii) ‘part-time home workers’. The first group contained both domestic and workshop-based producers, all full-time status, and showed highest levels of sales and profits. It was interesting to find that part-time professionals had lower profit levels than part-time home workers, even though almost all part-time professionals produced in workshops, half of them in government assisted workshops. One way ANOVA tests found significant differences between the clusters on thirteen person-related and contextual factors, including producers’ (i) education level, attendance in craft incubator, previous income activity, (ii) self-confidence, perseverance, (iii) skills relating to production, organising and networking, (iv) income maximisation motivation and (v) access to government supports, financial resources and reliable workers. The evidence from the research shows that handicraft producers in Sabah region see many advantages in domestic production, and profit levels can be higher than in workshops. By identifying the different profiles of handicraft producers in Sabah, and the person-related and contextual factors that influence them, this research may help the Malaysian government to develop effective support policies for different types of handicraft producer, including how to encourage more individuals to become ‘high performing full-timers’...|$|R
