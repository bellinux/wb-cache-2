50|$|Employees had {{a generous}} ration of beer at morning tea (called the beer break), lunch, {{afternoon}} tea {{and when they}} clocked off. Some of the trade supervisors were able to <b>float</b> between <b>bars</b> during the day. The brewery had several bars, in addition to which plant operators could tap a leaking cask for their own enjoyment; such a cask was called the honeypot. Tooth unsuccessfully sought a ruling from the Industrial Relations Commission that the honeypot would be banned. The ruling was that a precedent had been set. Subsequently, an inebriated operator, while travelling home, {{was hit by a}} train. Tooth successfully appealed the IRC decision. The honeypot was banned and instead Tooth would issue plastic tokens allowing employees to take home one carton of beer per week for their private enjoyment. That arrangement ended with CUB.|$|R
40|$|An {{alternative}} to the conventional telescopic fork type front suspension used in bicycles is the <b>Floating</b> handle <b>bar</b> suspension which replaces the two springs {{that are used in}} the Telescopic forks by a single open coiled spring of a greater wire diameter and stiffness thereby eliminating the need of telescopic forks. In our study we determine the spring that is to be used to produce the required suspension effect. The newly designed spring was integrated to the bicycle and the model was validated by a working prototype which was ridden to check for any failures. The bicycle model used for checking the effectiveness of floating handlebar suspension was a Hercules Terminator V 2. One major problem that we faced was the maneuverability of the bicycle during hard turns. This was due to the increase in weight of the front suspension...|$|R

2500|$|The RFB is a {{semi-automatic}} firearm chambered for 7.62×51mm NATO/.308 Winchester ammunition. The RFB uses metric FAL magazines, which insert {{straight into the}} magazine well and {{do not need to}} rock into place. It has a short-stroke gas piston operating system. The rifle uses a patented forward-ejection system via a tube placed over the barrel that ejects the spent case forwards, over the handguard of the rifle. Extraction is accomplished by two extractors, each with two axis of rotation. The extractors may move side-to-side to engage the rim of the case, and pivot upwards to extract the spent case after firing. [...] Empty cases remain in the ejection chute until either the weapon is tilted downwards, the charging handle is operated, or they are pushed out by following cases. Cases drop gently from this chute {{to the left of the}} barrel. To avoid sloppy trigger pull typical of firearms modified into bullpups, the RFB uses a <b>floating</b> linkage <b>bar</b> between the sear and the hammer, allowing the sear to remain above the trigger. The weapon is fully ambidextrous, much in the style of the Belgian F2000 rifle. The RFB is delivered without iron sights. A mil-spec Picatinny rail is provided for mounting a wide range of optics and tactical accessories.|$|R
5000|$|The Apple is a cider bar located by Bristol's harbour side. [...] Opened in 2004, this <b>bar</b> <b>floats</b> on water, {{as it was}} {{originally}} a Dutch barge. The Apple offers a range of 40 different ciders and cider related drinks, in addition to wine, beer, spirits and food.

Its quayside terrace and deck bar, make for a perfect hangout spot on a warm summer day, as recognized by the Guardian. Small Bar is a craft beer bar located in Central Bristol. It opened in December 2013, and has 31 taps in total. [...] Some beers are brewed on the premises, while others are taken from small companies, and independent breweries. Only halves, thirds, and two thirds glasses are served because the owners want their customers {{to be able to}} try as many beers as possible, and to ensure customers can finish their beer before it gets warm. [...] In October 2016, Small Bar opened in Cardiff, Wales. [...] Small Bar also serves food; its menu is short and experimental and rotates every few weeks.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{last evening}} was devastatingly sad as the heroic {{occupants}} of the death cells communicated to the prison in gentle melancholy song that their end was near... It was late at night when the singing ceased, and the prison fell into uneasy silence. I was already awake when the singing began again in the early morning. Once again the excruciatingly beautiful music <b>floated</b> through the <b>barred</b> windows, echoing round the brick exercise yard, losing itself in the vast prison yards.And then, unexpectedly, the voice of Vuyisile Mini came roaring down the hushed passages. Evidently standing on a stool, with his face reaching up to a barred vent in his cell, his unmistakable bass voice was enunciating his final message in Xhosa to the world he was leaving. In a voice charged with emotion but stubbornly defiant {{he spoke of the}} struggle waged by the African National Congress and of his absolute conviction of the victory to come. And then it was Khayinga's turn, followed by Mkaba, as they too defied all prison rules to shout out their valedictions. Soon after, I heard the door of their cell being opened. Murmuring voices reached my straining ears, and then the three martyrs broke into a final poignant melody which seemed to fill the whole prison with sound and then gradually faded away into the distant depths of the condemned section." ...|$|R
40|$|Research and {{development}} of a reliable dry land production system for common bean (Phaseolus vulgarisL.) based on low-cost direct seeding and direct harvest methods was initiated at the Crop Development Centre at the University of Saskatchewan in the late 1980 s. The target production area is a dry land spring wheat farming region in which lentil and pea production is well established. Effort is focussed on production of the pinto class. Three major potential improvements to the production system were identified: harvest equipment modification to improve direct harvest capability, development of early maturing germplasm with reliable expression of a crop canopy suitable for direct harvesting systems, and appropriate agronomy to improve the reliability of production. The research effort in harvest equipment modifications resulted in commercialization of a new design of lifter and reel assembly for combines equipped with <b>floating</b> cutter <b>bar</b> headers. Field scale evaluations showed that a 50 % reduction in cutter bar loss is possible with cultivars with Type III growth habit. Agronomy research for new production systems has been limited to development of improved rhizobial strains, but new areas of research will be explored as appropriate cultivars become available. Research {{in the area of}} germplasm development is specifically focussed on gains in early maturity and improvements in canopy structure, particularly for the pinto class. The ideal canopy structure for the production system is one in which all pods are situated above the combine cutter bar at the time of harvest. Specific improvements to the canopy structure include development of early maturing genotypes with elongated Type I growth habit, Type II growth habit or Type III growth habit without basal clustering of pods. In addition, an effort is underway to develop genotypes with shorter pods to maximize cutter bar clearance are under development and with pods with reduced lignin to minimize shattering and maximize cutter bar clearance. Reduction of lignin in pods may help reduce shattering at the time of harvest due to reduced dehiscence. Pods with reduced lignin tend to curve upward at the time of maturity, allowing better clearance of the cutter bar. Agronomic comparisons of F 2 -derived F 4 and F 5 lines showed that in some populations cutter bar losses can be reduced by up to 50 %...|$|R
6000|$|Now 'tis done, and I am glad And free--'twill thieve {{away with}} sleepy mood My thoughts, and yonder {{brightening}} patch of sky With three bars crossed, and these four walls my world, And yon few stars, grown dim like eyes of lovers The noisy world divides. How soon a deed So small makes one grow weak and tottering. Where shall I lay me down? That question is A weighty question, {{for it is}} the last. Not there, for there a spider weaves her web.

60|$|The brig now bore up, {{and stood}} for St. Domingo. She first {{went in to}} the city of St. Domingo, where the {{arrangements}} were made, and Spaniards were got to help to cut the wood, when we sailed for a bay, of which I have forgotten the name, and anchored near the shore. The trees were sawed down, about ten miles up a river, and <b>floated</b> to its <b>bar,</b> across which they had to be hauled by studding-sail halyards, through the surf; one man hauling two logs at a time, made into a sort of raft. Sharks abounded, and we had to keep a bright look-out, lest they got a leg while we were busy with the logs. I had a narrow escape from two while we lay at St. Domingo. A man fell overboard, and I went after him, succeeding in catching the poor fellow. A boat was dropped astern to pick us up, and, as we hauled the man in, two large sharks came up close alongside. This affair had set us drinking, and I got a good deal of punch aboard. The idea of remaining in the brig was unpleasant to me, and I had thought of quitting her for some days. A small schooner bound to America, and short of hands, lay near us; and I had told the captain I would come and join him that night. Jack Mallet and the rest tried to persuade me not to go, but I had too much punch and grog in me to listen to reason. When all hands aft were asleep, therefore, I let myself down into the water, and swam quite a cable's-length to the schooner. One of the men was looking out for me. He heard me in the water, and stood ready to receive me. As I drew near the schooner, this man threw me a rope, and helped me up the side, but, as soon as I was on the deck, he told me to look behind me. I did so, and there I saw an enormous shark swimming about, a fellow that was sixteen or eighteen feet long. This shark, I was told, had kept company with me as long as I had been in sight from the schooner. I cannot well describe the effect that was produced on me by this discovery. When I entered the water, I was under the influence of liquor, but this escape sobered me in a minute; so much so, indeed, that I insisted on being put in a boat, and sent back to the brig, which was done. I was a little influenced in this, however, by some reluctance that was manifested to keep me on board the schooner. I got on board the Venus without being discovered, and came to a resolution to stick by the craft until the voyage was up.|$|R
