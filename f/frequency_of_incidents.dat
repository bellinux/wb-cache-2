40|$|An often {{discussed}} {{phenomenon in}} education is teacher gender bias. Sadker & Sadker (1993) hypothesized that boys show {{a tendency to}} ignore standard behavioral norms in the classroom more frequently than girls do. This effect is aggravated {{by the fact that}} boys face less negative consequences from teachers when they are disruptive. The {{purpose of this study was}} to replicate these results, develop a categorization scheme for students ’ disruptive behaviors, and to classify teacher responses. Video footage of twenty-five classrooms (grade 1 - 9) were reviewed, identified by incident, and classified according to a rough starting categorization which was refined during the coding process. Teacher responses were coded similarly. We identified 574 incidents of disruptive behavior which fell into eight categories. Five types of teacher responses emerged. Contingency tables were analyzed to test associations between incident category, teacher responses and gender.

A retrospective review of public transit video surveillance footage of WhMDseated passengers accessing fixed-route LATVs was conducted. Ingress and egress activities were characterized based on travel conditions and characteristics of the WhMD and LATV ramp. Incidents were identified based on predetermined criteria, and chi-square analysis was performed to identify WhMD and/or ingress/egress characteristics associated with incidents. Video records of 250 WhMD trips were analyzed. A total of 39 incidents occurred during ingress and 12 incidents occurred during egress. Results indicated that the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> was significantly greater for scooter users and passengers who ascended the ramp using a rear-facing WhMD orientation.

OBJECTIVE: The authors tested whether a randomized interven-tion of playing baroque music for 30 -min periods would reduce the frequency of repetitive shouting and banging in elderly patients in a teaching hospital. STUDY DESIGN: Single case studies with 9 participants (7 females, 2 males), {{with a mean age of}} 82. 7 years (SD = 7. 44). Observations were made at different times of day for a minimum of four sessions. RESULTS: Trials with distracting music in seven cases had a reduced frequency of disruptive noises of from 89 % to 63 % from peak levels in control trials. In 2 participants with an extremely high <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents,</b> the frequency of out-bursts of noise was reduced by up to 31 % on trials with music compared to control trials.

40|$|The {{analytic}} {{solutions for}} the dynamic response of a shallow circular lined tunnel with an imperfectly bonded interface subjected to plane SH-waves are presented in the paper.

They included bullet impact, bonfire, feeder-breaker impact and feed-through, and mining machine runover tests.

Comparison results provide evidence that not every effective system is safe. Finally, three safety indicators are suggested which enables transit agencies to find their system’s weaknesses in terms of safety...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: An {{overview}} of the causes and <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> occurring on a fixed offshore structure, handling petroleum, is presented in this paper. Results are based on an analysis of a database of incident data covering a period of 2 years.

The analysis provides important information on incident modes and rates of occurrence for fixed offshore structures. Platform incident data {{can also be used}} to develop probabilities of future incidents, a key input for quantitative risk assessment. Personnel risk assessment is carried out to assess the safety of offshore workers on board the platform. Potential loss of life, fatal accident rate, and average individual risk are computed for personnel working on board the platform. These values are then compared with acceptable standard values to assess the current safety level on board the platform. Activity-based risk assessment is also carried out for six potentially risk-increasing activities. The results could be a valuable tool for improving personnel safety on board the platform and for setting up inspection and maintenance strategies for the platform...|$|E

Considering the <b>frequency</b> <b>of</b> <b>incidents</b> such as deaths resulting from road traffic accidents (RTAs), {{it is surprising that}} the academic literature regarding those who have accidentally killed is almost none existent. This study therefore aimed to gain an insight into the lived experiences of drivers who have caused an accidental death. Five participants were recruited through an on-line advertisement; all were drivers directly involved in a RTA that occurred suddenly, unexpectedly, without planning or intention and resulted in the death of a person. An interpretative phenomenological approach was used to analyse data collected through semistructured interviews. Three main themes emerged from the participants??? accounts: {{trying to make sense of}} a life changing moment; struggling to cope with the trauma of causing a death and a changed sense of self. These findings are discussed in relation to the relevant literature. Clinical implications, methodological limitations and directions for future research are presented.
