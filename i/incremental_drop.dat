40|$|Nudaurelia capensis omega {{virus has}} a well-characterized T = 4 capsid that {{undergoes}} a pH-dependent large conformational changes (LCC) and associated auto-catalytic cleavage of the subunit. We examined previously the particle size at different pH values {{and showed that}} maturation occurred at pH 5. 5. We now characterized the LCC with time-resolved small-angle x-ray scattering and showed that there were three kinetic stages initiated with an <b>incremental</b> <b>drop</b> in pH: 1), a rapid (< 10 ms) collapse to an incrementally smaller particle; 2), a continuous size reduction over the next 5 s; and 3), a smaller final transition occurring in 2 – 3 min. Equilibrium measurements similar to those reported previously, but now more precise, showed that the particle dimension between pH 5. 5 and 5 requires the autocatalytic cleavage to achieve its final compact size. A balance of electrostatic and structural forces shapes the energy landscape of the LCC with the latter requiring annealing of portions of the subunit. Equilibrium experiments showed that many intermediate states could be populated with a homogeneous ensemble of particles by carefully controlling the pH. A titration curve for the LCC was generated that showed that the virtual pKa (i. e., the composite of all titratable residues {{that contribute to the}} LCC) is 5. 8...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesPurpose: Cardio-respiratory {{physiotherapy}} {{for patients}} undergoing abdominal surgery {{has been found}} to be beneficial in improving lung function post-operatively and in the prevention and treatment of post-operative pulmonary complications (PPCs). The Blow Bottle, a Positive Expiratory Pressure (PEP) therapy device, is commonly used as an adjunct to physiotherapy. The Blow Bottle is low cost and can be easily made by the physiotherapist using readily available materials in the hospital setting. However, evidence to support the use of Blow Bottles in the post-operative management of abdominal surgery is minimal, with few studies reporting significant positive effects especially when compared to conventional cardio-respiratory physiotherapy techniques. Methodology: A randomized control was implemented in a public tertiary institution within the Western Cape. Patients admitted for open abdominal surgery via midline incision were eligible for the trial. Participants were randomly allocated to either the control group (CG) receiving conventional post-operative cardio-respiratory physiotherapy, or the intervention group (IG) who received the additional use of the Blow Bottle. Lung function and the development of post-operative pulmonary complications were the primary outcome s of this study. Lung Function was evaluated by means of spirometry testing and interpretation of Forced Expiratory Volume in 1 second (FEV 1) and Forced Vital Capacity (FVC). The development of post-operative pulmonary complications were diagnosed using the criteria by Mackay et al. (2005) where changes from pre-operative findings of auscultation; temperature, X-ray and sputum are evaluated post-operatively and recorded using the Adapted Abdominal Physiotherapy Outcomes Data Sheet (A-APODS). Results: A total of 19 participants were enrolled in the study, n= 11 (CG) and n= 8 (IG), predominantly female (n= 14) and admitted for cancer related abdominal surgery (n= 9). There was a statistically significant (p< 0. 05) marked reduction in post-operative lung function from baseline across groups, 62 % in FEV 1 and 47 % in FVC on the first post-operative day. The FEV 1 and FVC were similar across both the control and intervention groups for the first three post-operative days. On auscultation majority of participants had decreased breath sounds on the first post-operative day. However, no one participant developed a PPC across the duration of the study as diagnosed using the criteria by Mackay et al. (2005). Conclusion: Whether the additional use of the Blow Bottle is more beneficial than conventional post-operative cardio-physiotherapy alone is inconclusive due to the <b>incremental</b> <b>drop</b> out of participants from the study and small sample size. In this study there was however a significant reduction in lung function post-operatively. This mandates the need for further research investigating the abdominal surgical field and the use of devices to improve lung function, such as the Blow Bottle, as literature is scant and outdated, and sorely lacking in the resource constraint South African hospital settings...|$|E

40|$|This {{paper is}} a study of laminar flow in {{rectangular}} microchannels. The behaviour of compressible and incompressible fluids in microchannels was simulated using CFD software. Numerical data were compared to experimental measurements to test the validity of CFD models. The velocity profile of flow developing inside the channel {{is described as a}} function of the Reynolds number Re, varying from 100 to 2000, and the aspect ratio h/w, ranging from 1 to 0. 125. The fundamental importance of the entrance length of microchannels is highlighted. Numerical data were applied to define analytical formulae covering the minimum entrance length for fully developed laminar flow of compressible fluids, viscous stress and <b>incremental</b> pressure <b>drop</b> effect during flow development, and the velocity profiles of flow for compressible and incompressible fluids...|$|R

40|$|Typical {{industrial}} shell-and-tube {{heat exchanger}} configurations are investigated systematically for {{the occurrence of}} potentially damaging tube vibration {{as a function of}} flow-rate. In continuation of an ongoing experimental program, results from shell-side water flow tests of twenty-two additional test exchanger configurations are reported. The test cases include single- and double-segmentally baffled tube bundles having various combinations of triangular and square tube layout patterns, baffle arrangements, and baffle edge orientations. All layouts had a tube pitch-to-diameter ratio of 1. 25. The testing focused on identification of the lowest critical flow-rates to initiate fluid-elastic instability and/or large amplitude tube motion and the location within the bundle of the tubes which first experience these responses. The threshold flow-rates are determined from a combination of methods based on sensory observations, vibration amplitude data, and frequency response information. Instability criteria are preliminarily evaluated. Also reported are the measured overall shell-side pressure <b>drop</b> and the <b>incremental</b> pressure <b>drops</b> across sections of the exchanger for all configurations...|$|R
40|$|The {{continuity}} and Navier-Stokes equations govern {{the movement of}} a viscous fluid that may be assumed to be continuous. In order to model the micro-channel flows, however, owing to the small system dimensions that is comparable with the mean free path of the working fluid, the slip condition at the wall is often invoked {{in order to obtain}} realistic solutions, while employing the macroscopic balance laws. The slip boundary condition implies that at the walls, the tangential velocity need not be equal to the velocity of the solid surface [...] the latter is conventionally referred to as the "no-slip" condition. Among other things, the modelled velocity slip at the wall depends on the Knudsen number $Kn$, which is defined as the ratio of the mean free path of the fluid molecules and the characteristic system dimension. In the present study, the most general second-order slip condition, which involves the slip coefficients $C_ 1 $ and $C_ 2 $ as well as $Kn$, was implemented in an already existing code for solving the Navier-Stokes equations on orthogonal coordinates. Using the modified solver, the developing flows through the circular tubes and the parallel plate channels have been systematically analysed. The wall friction coefficients in the axial direction as well as the lengths required for the flow to be hydrodynamically fully-developed $L_{fd}$ were recorded as functions of $Kn$ and the Reynolds number $Re$ for different $C_ 2 $, while keeping $C_ 1 = 1 $. Using the numerical data, $L_{fd}$ was correlated with $Kn$, $C_ 2 $ and $Re$ and the resulting correlation was compared with the other correlations found in literature. As far as the pressure drop is concerned, it was observed that for certain values of $Kn$ and $C_ 2 $, the <b>incremental</b> pressure <b>drop</b> can even be negative. A few possible reasons for this phenomenon were stated...|$|R
