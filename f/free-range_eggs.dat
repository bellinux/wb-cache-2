2500|$|Free-range {{poultry farming}} allows {{chickens}} to roam freely {{for a period}} of the day, although they are usually confined in sheds at night to protect them from predators or kept indoors if the weather is particularly bad. In the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) states that a free-range chicken must have day-time access to open-air runs during at least half of its life. Unlike in the United States, this definition also applies to free-range egg laying hens. The European Union regulates marketing standards for egg farming which specifies a minimum condition for <b>free-range</b> <b>eggs</b> that [...] "hens have continuous daytime access to open-air runs, except in the case of temporary restrictions imposed by veterinary authorities". The RSPCA [...] "Welfare standards for laying hens and pullets" [...] indicates that the stocking rate must not exceed 1,000 birds per hectare (10 m2 per hen) of range available and a minimum area of overhead shade/shelter of 8 m2 per 1,000 hens must be provided.|$|E

40|$|Baseline {{information}} on demographics and practices on semi-intensive <b>free-range</b> <b>egg</b> farms with an outdoor stocking density of ≤ 1500 hens/hectare in Australia is presented. <b>Free-range</b> <b>egg</b> production {{is changing the}} structure of the egg industry in Australia and a broad variety and tiers of free-range systems have emerged due to lack of concrete legislative standards on outdoor stocking densities in the past. Information was extracted from a pre-existing online free-range poultry survey dataset, consisting of a total of 79 questions related to nutrition, pasture management, welfare and health, animal housing, environmental impact and economics. Forty-one <b>free-range</b> <b>egg</b> farms, with an outdoor stocking density of ≤ 1500 hens/hectare, were identified in the dataset from all major Australian states. Two types of semi-intensive free-range housing systems were documented: mobile (modified caravan/trailer) housing (56 %), and fixed sheds (44 %). Seventy-two percent of respondents reported > 75 % of the hens in the flock used the outdoor range. All respondents reported ingestion of range components by hens in the form of vegetation, insects, stones and grit. Up to 10 % mortality was reported by 40 % respondents with predation (34 %), cannibalism (29 %), heat stress (24 %) and grass impaction (19. 5 %) as major causes. Biosecurity on farms was sub-optimal with 8 of the 10 actions implemented by < 50 % respondents. Customer demand, consumer sentiment and welfare were the major factors for farmers moving into <b>free-range</b> <b>egg</b> production. This study resulted in identification of current practices and key challenges on semi-intensive <b>free-range</b> <b>egg</b> farms. Applied research and communication of results to farmers is highly recommended to ensure optimum health and welfare of free-range laying hens and sustained egg production...|$|R

50|$|Similar to {{all other}} forms of egg {{production}} in the United States, organic production is also regulated by animal welfare audit system. Mistreatment of the chickens could potentially lead a farmer to losing their organic certification. Thus some of the arguments from animal activist organizations that egg production is cruel and inhumane do not necessarily apply to organic raised hens. On the other hand, male chicks who are born on organic or <b>free-range</b> <b>egg</b> farms are still discarded, {{by the use of}} lethal gas, because they do not produce eggs. The American Organic Standards still allow beak trimming as a means to lessen injury to the birds.|$|R

40|$|Alternative {{production}} systems, such as cage-free or <b>free-range</b> <b>egg</b> production, {{have been}} growing in numbers to satisfy recent changes in consumer demands [1].

40|$|Housing {{systems for}} laying hens {{have changed over}} the years due to {{increased}} public concern regarding animal welfare. In terms of sustainability, animal welfare is just one aspect that needs to be considered. Social aspects as well as environmental and economic factors need to be included as well. In this study, we assessed the sustainability of enriched cage, barn, <b>free-range,</b> and organic <b>egg</b> production systems following a predefined protocol. Indicators were selected within the social, environmental, and economic dimensions, after which parameter values and sustainability limits were set for the core indicators in order to quantify sustainability. Uncertainty in the parameter values as well as assigned weights and compensabilities of the indicators influenced the outcome of the sustainability assessment. Using equal weights for the indicators showed that, for the Dutch situation, enriched cage egg production was most sustainable, having the highest score on the environmental dimension, whereas <b>free-range</b> <b>egg</b> production gave the highest score in the social dimension (covering food safety, animal welfare, and human welfare). In the economic dimension both enriched cage egg and organic egg production had the highest sustainability score. When weights were attributed according to stakeholder outputs, individual differences were seen, but the overall scores were comparable to the sustainability scores based on equal weights. The provided method enabled a quantification of sustainability using input from stakeholders to include societal preferences in the overall assessment. Allowing for different weights and compensabilities helps policymakers in communicating with stakeholders involved and provides a weighted decision regarding future housing systems for laying hens...|$|R

40|$|The egg {{industry}} in Wales {{is an important}} component of the agricultural sector. According to the Welsh Government?s Aggregate Agricultural Output and Income Statistics (2008, 2013), from 2006 until 2013, the value of egg production in Wales nearly doubled. The rising potential of egg production creates a need for research in the field of rural economic development and its inevitable environmental impact for the convergence area of Wales. The objective of this study was to define the major environmental impacts of <b>free-range</b> <b>egg</b> producing farms as well as to lay out basic strategies for improving the efficiency of freerange, non-GM egg farms under investigation. The study adopted an interdisciplinary, mixed methods approach. Qualitative data from in-depth interview has been used to consider the feasibility of improvement in business processes and relationships to advance performance. SWOT analysis has been used in order to examine the internal and external environment of the businesses studied and Retrenchment and Renewal Strategies have been proposed with the intention of looking into a wide-range of short-term actions that could reduce financial losses, stabilise the performance of businesses studied and work against the problems that contributed to poorer performance. The use of production and management accounting data from the collaborating enterprises allowed to calculate performance expectations for freerange, non-GM egg farms in areas such as egg production and feed. The results of this study indicated that there are various internal factors that influence the efficiency of the farms studied and all of them are directly or indirectly related to farmers? perceptions and motivations for running the business. Nevertheless, the external environment also has a great influence on the performance of the businesses, to the point that small and medium egg production could be perceived as a high-risk investment. In order to improve the efficiency of businesses studied this thesis proposed a list of recommendations that is believe to address all the issues related to egg farming which were raised during the research.

40|$|Investigating {{agroforestry}} {{systems that}} incorporate poultry is warranted in Northern Europe {{as they may}} offer benefits including: improved welfare and use of range; reduced feed costs; price premia on products; reduced payback periods for forests; and, greater returns on investment. <b>Free-range</b> <b>egg</b> production accounts for 27 % of the United Kingdom egg market and demand for outdoor broilers is increasing. No {{research has been conducted}} recently on the economic viability of agroforestry systems with poultry. An economic model was constructed to: assess economic viability of a broiler agroforestry system; and, investigate the sensitivity of economic performance to key factors and interactions, and identify those which warrant attention in research and management. The system modelled is a commercial trial established in Southern England in 2002 where deciduous trees were planted and broilers reared in six- or nine-week periods. The model uses Monte Carlo simulation and financial performance analyses run for a 120 -year period. An Internal Rate of Return (IRR) of 15. 5 % is predicted for the six-week system which remains viable under a 'worst case' scenario (IRR of 12. 6 %). Factors which affect financial performance most (decreasing in magnitude) are prices achieved for broilers, costs of brooding houses, chicks, arks, feed and timber prices. The main anticipated effects of biological interactions on financial performance (increased ranging on feed conversion and excess nutrient supply on tree health) were not supported by analysis. Further research is particularly warranted on the welfare benefits offered by the tree component and its relation to price premia...|$|R
