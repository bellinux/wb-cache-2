25|$|<b>Intermediate-level</b> <b>waste</b> (ILW) {{contains}} higher {{amounts of}} radioactivity {{and in general}} require shielding, but not cooling. Intermediate-level wastes includes resins, chemical sludge and metal nuclear fuel cladding, as well as contaminated materials from reactor decommissioning. It may be solidified in concrete or bitumen for disposal. As a general rule, short-lived waste (mainly non-fuel materials from reactors) is buried in shallow repositories, while long-lived waste (from fuel and fuel reprocessing) is deposited in geological repository. U.S. regulations do not define this category of waste; the term is used in Europe and elsewhere.|$|E
25|$|Transuranic waste (TRUW) {{as defined}} by U.S. {{regulations}} is, without regard to form or origin, waste that is contaminated with alpha-emitting transuranic radionuclides with half-lives greater than 20 years and concentrations greater than 100nCi/g (3.7MBq/kg), excluding high-level waste. Elements that have an atomic number greater than uranium are called transuranic ("beyond uranium"). Because of their long half-lives, TRUW is disposed more cautiously than either low- or <b>intermediate-level</b> <b>waste.</b> In the U.S., it arises mainly from weapons production, and consists of clothing, tools, rags, residues, debris and other items contaminated with small amounts of radioactive elements (mainly plutonium).|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{concern that the}} Sellafield area will become a major dumping ground for {{unwanted}} nuclear material, since there are currently no long-term facilities for storing High-Level Waste (HLW), although the UK has current contracts to reprocess spent fuel {{from all over the}} world. Contracts agreed since 1976 between BNFL and overseas customers require that all HLW be returned to the country of origin. The UK retains low- and <b>intermediate-level</b> <b>waste</b> resulting from its reprocessing activity, and instead ships out a radiologically equivalent amount of its own HLW. This substitution policy is intended to be environmentally neutral and to speed return of overseas material by reducing the number of shipments required, since HLW is far less bulky.|$|E
50|$|The PNRA {{proposed}} new Waste Management offices to {{control of the}} radiation and radioactive materials. The Waste Management Centres are proposed for Karachi, Rawalpindi, Nilore, Lahore and Chashma. Used fuel is currently stored at each reactor in pools. Longer-term dry storage at each site is proposed. The question of future reprocessing remains open. A National Repository for low- and <b>intermediate-level</b> <b>wastes</b> is due to be commissioned by 2015.|$|R

40|$|A {{variety of}} intermediate- and {{low-level}} liquid and solid wastes are produced from reactor production of 99 Mo using UAl alloy or UO 2 targets and in principle can be collectively or individually converted into waste forms. At ANSTO, we have legacy acidic uranyl-nitrate-rich {{intermediate level waste}} (ILW) from the latter, and an alkaline liquid ILW, a U-rich filter cake, plus a shorter lived liquid stream that rapidly decays to low-level waste (LLW) standards, from the former. The options considered consist of cementitious products, glasses, glass-ceramics, or ceramics produced by vitrification or hot isostatic pressing for <b>intermediate-level</b> <b>wastes.</b> This paper discusses the progress in waste form development and processing to treat ANSTO’s ILW streams arising from 99 Mo. The various waste forms {{and the reason for}} the process option chosen will be reviewed. We also address the concerns over adapting our chosen process for use in a hot-cell environment...|$|R

50|$|Isosaccharinic acid (ISA) is a six-carbon sugar acid {{which is}} {{formed by the}} action of calcium {{hydroxide}} on lactose and other carbohydrates. It is of interest because it may form in <b>intermediate-level</b> nuclear <b>waste</b> stores when cellulose is degraded by the calcium hydroxide in cements such as Portland cement. The calcium salt of the alpha form of ISA is very crystalline and quite insoluble in cold water, but in hot water it is soluble.|$|R
40|$|Vitrification is {{used for}} the {{immobilization}} and conditioning of high-level waste (HLW) arising from the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuel in the UK. Vitrification is also under consideration for the immobilization of certain <b>intermediate-level</b> <b>wastes</b> (ILW), where there may be advantages of volume reduction and removal of uncertainties in long-term waste behaviour, compared to encapsulation in a cement grout. This paper gives an overview of recent work into the chemical durability of UK vitrified wasteforms to inform the technical specification for the disposal facilities for these waste products and the treatment of their long-term behaviour in post-closure performance assessment. This has included: (1) measurements of the initial glass dissolution rates of a simulated HLW Magnox waste glass in a range of groundwater types representative of potential UK host geologies and in simulated high pH near-field porewaters relevant to potential disposal concepts, using Product Consistency Test type-B (PCT-B) at 40 ºC; and (2) durability testing of three simulant ILW glasses in a saturated calcium hydroxide buffered solution to simulate conditions in cement-based disposal vaults, using PCT-B tests at 50 ºC.

40|$|The Old Hydrofracture (OHF) Facility was an {{experimental}} waste disposal test site {{located at the}} Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. ORNL is a research facility owned by the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) and managed by Lockheed Martin Energy Research Corp. Legacy environmental restoration sites, such as the OHF Facility, are managed for DOE by Lockheed Martin Energy Systems, Inc.

50|$|HLW {{contains}} {{many of the}} fission products and transuranic elements generated in the reactor core and {{is the type of}} nuclear waste with the highest activity. HLW accounts for over 95% of the total radioactivity produced in the nuclear power process. In other words, while most nuclear waste is low-level and <b>intermediate-level</b> <b>waste,</b> such as protective clothing and equipment that have been contaminated with radiation, the majority of the radioactivity produced from the nuclear power generation process comes from high-level waste.|$|E

40|$|Most of the wastes {{produced}} in the developing countries are low- and <b>intermediate-level</b> <b>wastes.</b> These wastes are initially stored on-site. Since applications using of the radioactive materials is increasing, in some countries, the radioactive wastes are accumulating {{to the point that}} the initial on-site storage has to be expanded. In order to increase interim storage capacity, existing capacity must be increased or replaced with a new permanent facility. The waste management system cost must be considered to achieve the most cost effectiveness. The management of radioactive waste includes every step in the system from the waste generator to the final disposal. The major costs in the waste system are: processing costs, transportation costs, and burial costs. However, modification of one step to reduce its cost may impact other costs in the system and even increase total costs as well. Computer models have been developed that simulate the entire system so that interactive may be evaluated to determine for estimating the generic total waste system cost and average unit disposal cost. The radioactive waste materials {{produced in}} Thailand are used as input data to test the models. The preliminary site screening and site design study to identify the potentially suitable site areas are also performed in this study. The sensitivity analyses obtained from the disposal model show that the rate of return or interest rate, the operating cost and the capital costs affect the disposal unit cost. The development, and postoperating period do not affect on the disposal unit cost. The results obtained from system cost model show that type of waste, volume reduction factor, and treatment technology affect the waste management system cost...|$|R
