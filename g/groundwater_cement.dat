40|$|A {{preliminary}} survey {{has been made}} of the stable isotope composition of secondary carbonates in the Ogallala Group of western Nebraska. The {{purpose of the study was}} to ascertain whether the isotopic signatures of calcareous paleosols in the fine grained facies of the Ogallala and <b>groundwater</b> <b>cements</b> in gravel facies might provide a basis for stratigraphic correlation and/or paleoclimatic interpretation. The <b>groundwater</b> <b>cemented</b> channel gravels are modestly depicted in IRO (δ 18 O = – 10 ‰) as compared to calcareous paleo 2 ̆ 7 sols (δ 18 O = – 8. 0 to – 9. 0 ‰). Gravels of different age, however, have essentially identical isotopic signatures. The isotopic variability within paleosols is about as great as the variability between palcosols. As a result, the mean isotopic values for individual paleosols are not significantly different from one anothcr. Thus, stratigraphic correlation of paleosols based on isotopic signatures will not be possible unless intensive vertical and lateral sampling capable of distinguishing small differences among paleosols is undertaken. Nevertheless, when the mean 0180 values for individual paleosols are arranged in the stratigraphic order proposed by Lugn (1939), they increase upsection from about – 9. 0 ‰ to – 8. 0 ‰, suggesting that the pedogenic environment possibly became more arid through time. Unfortunately, this trend is not confirmed by a clear upsection increase in δ 13 C values...|$|R
5000|$|Much strong {{evidence}} for <b>groundwater</b> <b>cementing</b> materials {{comes from the}} results of the Opportunity Rover. Some places, examined by Opportunity such as Endurance, Eagle, and Erebus craters {{have been found to be}} where the water table breached the surface., [...] Also, it was discovered that wind-driven currents of water transported sediment at these locations. Small surface cracks are thought to have formed during multiple wetting and drying events, so they are evidence that the groundwater rose and fell. Ferric sulfates (such as jarosite) in the rocks of Meridiani Planum indicates that acidic fluids were present. These acidic liquids could have been produced when water with dissolved Fe(II) was oxidized as it reached the surface. Hydrologic models predict that groundwater should indeed emerge in the Sinus Meridiani region.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{installation}} of pressure transducers in deep boreholes {{is a key}} feature of determining the effectiveness of gas drainage {{and the effect of}} mining on the groundwater regime. This paper covers the work undertaken to ensure reliability of data obtained from deep formation monitoring boreholes for both coal seam gas and <b>groundwater.</b> <b>Cementing</b> technology has enabled strings of transducers to be installed at greater depths with reliable zonal isolation between close sensing points. However the behaviour of grout at depth can be problematic with the effect of filtration, consolidation, skin and dehydration of the grout rendering the installation only partially effective. A review of cementing grouts and additives was undertaken and mix designs developed, to suit the requirements of deep borehole monitoring. Techniques were developed to mitigate the vicissitudes of grout and ensure both zonal isolation and connectivity of the transducer to the formation. The paper also reviews the automated data acquisition systems used for monitoring installations...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} of <b>groundwater</b> with <b>cement</b> in a geological disposal facility (GDF) for intermediate level radioactive waste {{will produce a}} high pH leachate plume. Such a plume may alter the {{physical and chemical properties}} of the GDF host rock. However, the geochemical and mineralogical processes which may occur in such systems over timescales relevant for geological disposal remain unclear. This study has extended the timescale for laboratory experiments and shown that, after 15 years two distinct phases of reaction may occur during alteration of a dolomite-rich rock at high pH. In these experiments the dissolution of primary silicate minerals and the formation of secondary calcium silicate hydrate (C–S–H) phases containing varying amounts of aluminium and potassium (C–(A) –(K) –S–H) during the early stages of reaction (up to 15 months) have been superseded as the systems have evolved. After 15 years significant dedolomitisation (MgCa(CO 3) 2 + 2 OH−→Mg(OH) 2 +CaCO 3 +CO 32 −(aq)) has {{led to the formation of}} magnesium silicates, such as saponite and talc, containing variable amounts of aluminium and potassium (Mg–(Al) –(K) –silicates), and calcite at the expense of the early-formed C–(A) –(K) –S–H phases. This occured in high pH solutions representative of two different periods of cement leachate evolution with little difference in the alteration processes in either a KOH and NaOH or a Ca(OH) 2 dominated solution but a greater extent of alteration in the higher pH KOH/NaOH leachate. The high pH alteration of the rock over 15 years also increased the rock’s sorption capacity for U(VI). The results of this study provide a detailed insight into the longer term reactions occurring during the {{interaction of}} cement leachate and dolomite-rich rock in the geosphere.

40|$|This work {{investigates the}} {{suitability}} of the Nigerian Portland-limestone cement grades 32. 5 and 42. 5 {{for the construction of}} building structural members in various exposure condition/classes. The investigation was conducted by comparing the 25 MPa, 27 MPa and 30 MPa average cube compressive strengths and the 30 MPa, 30 Mpa and 31 MPa average cube compressive strengths of 1 : 2 : 4, 1 : 1. 5 : 3 and 1 : 1 : 2 concretes produced with Portland-limestone cement grades 32. 5 and 42. 5 respectively with the minimum durability concrete strength requirements for building structural members in Eurocode 2 exposure classes that are obtainable in Nigeria. Investigation revealed that Portland-limestone cement grades 32. 5 is only suitable for the construction of superstructure members inside low humidity buildings (class XC 1) and is not suitable for the construction of buried building foundations and external building superstructure members.

40|$|Within the {{framework}} of the GTS-LCS project (Grimsel Test Site – Long-Term Cement Studies), an in-situ experiment lasting about 5 years was started in 2009 to study water-cement-rock interactions in fractured granite. A solid cement source (OPC) was installed in a borehole intersecting a water conducting fracture. Two other boreholes at about 0. 56 m (observation) and 1. 12 m (extraction) from the emplacement borehole were used to monitor the evolution of water composition in the fracture. Prior to the experiment, a tracer test was performed to characterize the initial flow and transport properties of the rock around the experimental boreholes. The flow and reactive transport calculations have been performed using the Retraso-CodeBright code. Solute transport is assumed to be controlled by diffusion in the cement and by advection-dispersion in the rock fracture. Initially, the flow model calculated from the results of the pre-emplacement tracer test, assuming a homogeneous fracture, was used to model reactive transport after emplacement of the cement. Since the small grid size from the flow model led to excessive computational times, the domain was divided into (a) a 1 D radial model for the emplacement borehole and a small volume of rock around it, and (b) a 2 D model {{for the rest of the}} domain. The results from (a) were used as input for (b). The model results show dissolution of portlandite and C-S-H in a thin (mm) external layer of the cement (emplacement borehole). In the rock fracture there is dissolution of the primary silicates (except phlogopite) and precipitation of C-S-H, C-A-S-H and calcite. Fracture porosity is reduced in a belt around the 3 boreholes, converging at the extraction borehole (due to the magnitude of the extraction flow rate). The decrease in porosity, due mainly to the precipitation of calcite, is stronger right next to the extraction borehole, due to the more favorable mixing conditions between Grimsel <b>groundwater</b> and <b>cement</b> porewater. The changing water injection rate conditions in the emplacement borehole lead to changes in the flow field and in the position of the mineral reaction fronts. Preprin...|$|R
40|$|The favored pathway for {{disposal}} of higher activity radioactive wastes is via deep geological disposal. Many geological disposal facility designs include cement in their engineering design. Over the long term, interaction of <b>groundwater</b> with the <b>cement</b> and waste will form {{a plume of}} a hyperalkaline leachate (pH 10 - 13), and the behavior of radionuclides needs to be constrained under these extreme conditions to minimize the environmental hazard from the wastes. For uranium, {{a key component of}} many radioactive wastes, thermodynamic modeling predicts that, at high pH, U(VI) solubility will be very low (nM or lower) and controlled by equilibrium with solid phase alkali and alkaline-earth uranates. However, the formation of U(VI) colloids could potentially enhance the mobility of U(VI) under these conditions, and characterizing the potential for formation and medium-term stability of U(VI) colloids is important in underpinning our understanding of U behavior in waste disposal. Reflecting this, we applied conventional geochemical and microscopy techniques combined with synchrotron based in situ and ex situ X-ray techniques (small-angle X-ray scattering and X-ray adsorption spectroscopy (XAS)) to characterize colloidal U(VI) nanoparticles in a synthetic cement leachate (pH > 13) containing 4. 2 - 252 μM U(VI). The results show that in cement leachates with 42 μM U(VI), colloids formed within hours and remained stable for several years. The colloids consisted of 1. 5 - 1. 8 nm nanoparticles with a proportion forming 20 - 60 nm aggregates. Using XAS and electron microscopy, we were able to determine that the colloidal nanoparticles had a clarkeite (sodium-uranate) -type crystallographic structure. The presented results have clear and hitherto unrecognized implications for the mobility of U(VI) in cementitious environments, in particular those associated with the geological disposal of nuclear waste.

40|$|The Western Interior Basin of the North America {{preserves}} one of {{the best}} sedimentary and paleontological records of the Cretaceous in the world. The Upper Cretaceous Kaiparowits Formation is a rapidly deposited fluvial sequence and preserves {{one of the}} most complete terrestrial fossil record of the North America. Such a unique deposit provides an opportunity to investigate the interaction between the physical environment and ecology. In an effort to decipher such interaction, stable isotope composition of cements in sedimentary rocks, concretions and vertebrate fossils were analyzed. Despite the difference in facies and sedimentary architecture, the isotope composition does not change significantly at ~ 110 m {{from the base of the}} formation. Among the well-preserved cement samples, stable isotope composition indicates a significant hydrologic change within the informal Middle unit; a 6. 37 ‰ depletion in d 13 C and 3. 30 ‰ enrichment in d 18 O occurs at ~ 300 m above the base of the formation. The isotope values indicate that the sandstone cements below 300 m were precipitated in a mixing zone between marine and terrestrial <b>groundwater,</b> whereas the <b>cements</b> in upper units were precipitated in a terrestrial groundwater. Despite the difference in physical appearance (i. e. color and shape), the isotopic compositions of cements in concretions are similar to well-cemented sandstone bodies in similar stratigraphic positions. Isotope compositions of the host rock are similar to that of mudrock and weathered sandstone, suggesting the origin of cementing fluids for the sandstone and concretions were the same indicating that: 1) the concretions were formed in shallow groundwater and not related to the groundwater migration, or 2) all cements in upper Kaiparowits Formation are precipitated or altered during later stage groundwater migration. Average d 18 Oc from each taxon show the same trend as the d 18 Op stratigraphic change, suggesting d 18 Oc is still useful as a paleoclimatic proxy. Compared to other Campanian formations, fossil d 18 Op are depleted for their paleolatitude, suggesting the Kaiparowits Plateau had higher input from high-elevation runoff, consistent with other paleoclimatic studies. Estimated d 18 Ow ranged between vadose influenced dry season values of - 8. 88 ‰ to high elevation runoff values of - 13. 76 ‰ suggesting dynamic hydrologic interactions...|$|R
40|$|Grouting is {{performed}} {{in order to}} decrease the permeability and increase the stiffness of the material, especially soil and rock. For tunnelling and underground constructions, permeation grouting is done where cement based materials are pumped inside drilled boreholes under a constant pressure, higher than the ground water pressure. The aim of permeation grouting {{is to reduce the}} water flow into tunnels and caverns and to limit the lowering of the surrounding <b>groundwater</b> table. <b>Cement</b> based materials are commonly used as grout due to their availability and lower costs. To obtain a proper water sealing and reduce the lowering of the ground water table, a desired spread of grout must be achieved and the rheology of the cement grout is the governing factor for estimating the required spread. Rheological properties of cement grout such as viscosity and yield stress are commonly measured off-line using laboratory instruments, and some simple tools are available to make field measurements. Although the rheological properties of the grout that is used play a fundamental role in design and execution, no method has yet been developed to measure these properties in-line in field work. In addition to the real time measurement, there is no standard method for determining the yield stress for grouting applications. Despite the common usage of Bingham model fitting to determine the yield stress, the range of shear rate is often not specified or is neglected.   In this work, an in-line rheometry method combining the Ultrasound Velocity Profiling (UVP) technique with Pressure Difference (PD) measurements, known as “UVP+PD”, was successfully tested for continuous in-line measurements of concentrated micro cement based grouts. A major obstacle of using the ultrasound based methodology was the transducers, which would be capable of emitting sufficient acoustic energy and can be used in field conditions. The transducer technology was developed in a parallel project and the Flow-Viz industrial rheometer was found to be capable of detail measurement of the velocity profiles of cement grout. The shape of the velocity profiles was visualized, and the change {{in the shape of the}} profiles with concentration and time was observed. The viscosity and yield stress of the grout were determined using rheological models, e. g. Bingham and Herschel-Bulkley. In addition, rheological properties were determined using the non-model approach (gradient method) and the tube viscometry concept and were compared with results obtained using the rheological models. The UVP+PD method was found to be capable of determining the rheological behavior of cement grout regardless of the rheological model. The yield stress of cement grout was investigated using off-line rheometry techniques and UVP+PD in-line measurements. Tests were performed applying different shear histories and it was found that two ranges of yield stress indeed exist. Therefore, the design value of yield stress should be chosen with respect to the prevailing shear rate at the grout front for the required spread of grout. In addition, an appropriate shear rate range should be used when a Bingham fitting is done to determine the yield stress. In order to estimate the shear rate, plug thickness and velocity for one dimensional and two dimensional geometry, a non- dimensional nomogram was developed. The advantage of using the nomogram is that it does not depend on the applied pressure and the rheological properties of the grout and can therefore, be used as a simple design tool. Analytical approaches were used for the estimation and good agreements were found with numerical calculations and experimental results. In conclusion, in this work, it was found that it is possible to continuously measure the velocity profiles and determine the change of the rheological properties of cement grout using the ultrasound based UVP+PD method under field conditions. The yield stress was also investigated and it was found that two range of yield stress exist depending on the prevailing shear rate of the grout, which should be used for designing the grouting time at different conditions. In order to decide the design value of yield stress for grouting applications, a non-dimensional nomogram was developed that can be used to estimate the plug thickness, shear rate and velocity of the grout.   Funding for the project was provided by the Swedish Rock Engineering Research Foundation (BeFo), The Swedish Research Council (FORMAS) and The Development Fund of the Swedish Construction Industry (SBUF), who are gratefully acknowledged.
