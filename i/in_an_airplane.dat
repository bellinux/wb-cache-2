5|$|About {{the time}} of the {{completion}} of the Alaska Railroad {{and the beginning of the}} dredging era in Fairbanks, Alaska's aviation industry began to take off.

The aircraft had been crated and sent from Seattle via Skagway and Whitehorse. The pilot subsequently tried to sell the aircraft, but had no takers. Alaska's first commercial aircraft didn't arrive until June 1923, when Noel Wien began flying a Curtiss JN-4 on mail routes between Fairbanks and isolated communities. From Fairbanks, Wien became the first person to fly to Anchorage and cross the Arctic Circle <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane.</b>|$|E

In October 1910, St. Louis hosted President Theodore Roosevelt, who became the first president to fly <b>in</b> <b>an</b> <b>airplane</b> after departing from the field. In 1925, local entrepreneur Albert Lambert purchased Kinloch Field, expanded its facilities, and renamed it Lambert Field. In May 1927, Charles Lindbergh departed from Lambert Field en route to New York to begin his solo non-stop flight across the Atlantic Ocean. In early 1928, the city of St. Louis purchased the airport from Lambert, making it the first municipally owned airport in the United States; Lambert remains the area's primary airport.|$|E
