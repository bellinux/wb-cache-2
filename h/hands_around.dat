A few weeks later, in November 1989, R broke into the house while his wife's parents were out, and attempted to force her to have sexual intercourse with him against her will. He also assaulted her, squeezing his <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> her neck.|$|E
5|$|Early on 25 September, Harald and Tostig {{departed}} their {{landing place}} at Riccall {{with most of}} their forces, but left {{a third of their}} forces behind. They brought only light armour, as they expected to just meet the citizens of York, as they had agreed the day before, at Stamford Bridge to decide on who should manage the town under Harald. Once there Harald saw Godwinson's forces approaching, heavily armed and armoured, and greatly outnumbering Harald's. Although (according to non-saga sources) the English forces were held up at the bridge for some time by a single gigantic Norwegian, allowing Harald and Tostig to regroup into a shield-wall formation, Harald's army was in the end heavily beaten. Harald was struck in the throat by an arrow and killed early in the battle in a state of berserkergang, having worn no body armour and fought aggressively with both <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> his sword.|$|E
5|$|In early 2009, Torres began a scripted {{feud with}} Michelle McCool after McCool {{attacked}} her. On the February 6 episode of SmackDown, Eve made her singles match debut in a losing effort against McCool via submission. Their feud continued {{for the next}} few months, with the two competing against each other in singles and tag team matches. In mid-2009, Eve started competing in dance and arm wrestling competitions against Layla, later defeating her on the May 29 episode of SmackDown in a singles match. On the June 18 episode of Superstars, Eve pinned Layla once again. After the match, they both shook <b>hands.</b> <b>Around</b> the same as her scripted rivalry with Layla, Eve became associated with Cryme Tyme (Shad and JTG), where Torres accompanied them to the ring as their manager. Eve and Cryme Tyme then participated in multiple six-person mixed tag team matches against The Hart Dynasty (David Hart Smith, Tyson Kidd, and Natalya), with Eve also facing Natalya in singles and tag team matches involving other Divas. Her final match on SmackDown was on October 9, when she was defeated in a singles match by McCool.|$|E

5|$|Mummification was a {{tradition}} that many other pre-Columbian civilisations practiced. On the Altiplano, the habit of conserving the dead started in the Herrera Period, around the 5th century AD. The Muisca continued this culture and prepared their deceased beloved {{members of the society}} by putting the bodies above fires. The heat would dry the body and the phenol conserve the organs and protect them from decomposition, a process that took up to eight hours. After drying, the bodies were wrapped in cotton cloths and placed in caves, buried, or in some cases placed on elevated platforms inside temples, such as the Sun Temple. The position of the mummies was with their arms folded across the chest and the <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> the chin, while the legs were placed over the abdomen. During the preparation of the mummies, the Muisca played music and sang songs honouring their dead. The habit of mummification continued well into the colonial period; the youngest mummies found date from {{the second half of the}} 18th century.|$|E

25|$|The kolo is a {{collective}} folk dance common in various South Slavic regions, such as Serbia, {{named after the}} circle formed by the dancers. It is performed amongst groups of people (usually several dozen, {{at the very least}} three) holding each other's having their <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> each other's waists (ideally in a circle, hence the name).

25|$|The {{performance}} finally improved but {{the result}} stayed the same when Middlesbrough went to Old Trafford, where Matthew Bates started a Middlesbrough game {{for the first time}} since the end of the 2005–06 season. Manchester United boss Alex Ferguson had spoken before the game, hoping to banish the rift that existed between the two clubs. Things probably weren't helped when Pogatetz, defending a corner, put his <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> the back of Cristiano Ronaldo's neck a corner and the United player went down, claiming a penalty. The spat continued when the players walked off the pitch for half time. Dimitar Berbatov's goal was the decisive moment in the game when he fired home to give his side a 1–0 victory, and left Middlesbrough hovering above the relegation zone on goal difference and without a win in eight games.|$|E
25|$|On the January 19 {{episode of}} Raw, Ambrose {{defeated}} Intercontinental Champion Bad News Barrett in a non-title match. At the Royal Rumble on January 25, Ambrose {{participated in the}} Royal Rumble match, but was eliminated by Big Show and Kane. The following weeks, Ambrose demanded a match for Barrett's title which Barrett declined, leading to Ambrose attacking him, tying his <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> the ring post and forcing him to sign a contract for a title match at Fastlane on February 22, where Ambrose lost the subsequent match by disqualification, but stole the championship belt afterward. At WrestleMania 31 on March 29, Ambrose participated in a seven-man ladder match for the championship, but lost after Luke Harper performed a powerbomb on him through a ladder and knocked {{him out of the}} match as result. After further attacks between the two, Ambrose defeated Harper at Extreme Rules on April 26, his first singles victory on a pay-per-view event since The Shield split up.|$|E

25|$|On August 29, 2007, a {{chain link}} fence was {{constructed}} around the protesters. The fence was erected to prevent {{confrontation between the}} protesters and the sellout crowd of 72,516 people (17,000 of them from Tennessee, the opposing team) that were expected to attend the opening game of the California Golden Bears' football season. Protesters responded with shouts and promises to {{make it difficult for}} the UCPD to guard the fence. The protesters claimed the fence was erected not to protect them, but to starve them out. Some have drawn comparisons between the building of the fence, and the attempted take back of People's Park in 1969, in which the California National Guard was called in to remove protesters. Initially the police did not allow food and water to be passed over the fence to the tree sitters, but started to allow the deliveries by the evening. Two men were arrested following scuffles with police. Around 200 additional people joined <b>hands</b> <b>around</b> the fence in support of the tree sitters. The fence cost the University between $10,000 and $12,000 to build. Despite the fence more protesters took up spots in the trees.|$|E
