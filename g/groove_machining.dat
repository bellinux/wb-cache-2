The numerical broaching force is calculated to improve deformation of the processed round tank. This paper uses the planer to make cutting tests that are carried out in shaping machine to simulate the wheel broaching process and measures the cutting force in the experiment. After analyzing the unit numerical cutting force of GH 4698 broaching is finally obtained. It provides a simple method to calculate the cutting force of wheel <b>groove</b> <b>machining...</b>|$|E
40|$|Micro {{machining}} of single-crystalline silicon {{is performed}} with the second-harmonic of Nd:YAG laser in this study. In experiments, various shapes of plastic microlens are fabricated on a transparent substrate by the developed die-less method. These microlenses are shaped by thermal deformation induced by the Er:YAG laser beam absorbable for the acrylate resin. And then, these lenses are used as optical devices to generate the local high energy density desired for machining of silicon in air and water. Machining characteristics are investigated in the single <b>groove</b> <b>machining</b> process, and the grid groove pattern and the herringbone pattern are formed to demonstrate the feasibility of proposed methods...|$|E

Based on an {{experimental study of}} hole and <b>groove</b> <b>machining</b> on an amorphous glass by abrasive air jet, the effects of processing parameters on the produced structure profile such as groove width or hole diameter, depth of cut and kerf taper angle are analyzed. It shows that the stand-off distance has {{a significant effect on}} the kerf width. Both the hole diameter and kerf width increase notably with an increase in stand-off distance. Positive correlation has been found between the depth of cut and air pressure. Under the same cutting conditions, low taper angle can be achieved when using small nozzles...|$|E

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of using foil materials as tool electrode in micro {{electro discharge machining}} (micro EDM) has provided new machining alternative for the spark erosion of micro grooves. To complement the widely used (and expensive) micro EDM tool electrode material (tungsten), two cost effective materials namely graphite and stainless steel have been tried as tool electrodes. Recent technological innovations have provided novel flushing techniques such as the utilization of gravitational and magnetic forces in debris removal. A study {{on the performance of}} tool electrode materials vis-à-vis these novel flushing techniques in micro EDM is discussed in this paper. It is noticed that the graphite provides the maximum MRR while the tungsten provides the lowest surface roughness during the micro <b>groove</b> <b>machining</b> on tool steel.

40|$|International audiencePrecise weight {{measurements}} of stainless steel, PZT and PMMA samples were performed after <b>groove</b> <b>machining</b> with femtosecond laser pulses (150 fs, 800 nm, 5 kHz) to determine volume ablation rates and ablation threshold with good accuracy. Weighing clearly enables faster determination of such phenomenological parameters without any methodological issue {{compared to other}} methods. Comparisons of {{the three types of}} materials reveal similar monotonous trends depending on peak fluences from 0. 2 to 15 J/cm 2. The metallic target exhibits both the lowest volume ablation rate under the highest irradiation conditions with almost 400 µm 3 /pulse and the lowest ablation threshold with 0. 13 J/cm 2. Ceramic PZT reaches 3. 103 µm 3 /pulse with a threshold fluence of 0. 26 J/cm 2 while polymer PMMA attains 104 µm 3 /pulse for a 0. 76 J/cm 2 threshold. Pros and cons of this method are also deduced from complementary results obtained on microscopic and confocal characterizations...|$|E
40|$|The {{effectiveness}} of laser assisted machining (LAM) in tool life extension and machining surface improvement {{has been widely}} recognised. This machining method is proven can be applied on various range of materials. Heat energy applied on materials need to be high enough to heat up and soften the material but keep them under the deformation temperature. LAM of titanium alloy using lathe and milling machine were reported able to prolong the tool life and improve cutting surface quality. However the application of ball milling remains {{a lot of issues}} need to be addressed. In the case of ball milling, the removal process involves more complicated mechanism compared to turning and end milling process. This study discusses the {{effectiveness of}} LAM method when micro ball mill cutting tool is used for deep <b>groove</b> <b>machining</b> of Ti 6 A 14 V. In micro level. the material behaves more plastically. The relation between cutting forces, tool wear rate and chips pattern were experimentally studied and discussed. It is proven that the heating process was effectively softening the material. However, it is also found out that in micro level, softening a ductile material such Ti 6 A 14 V will not necessarily improve the machining performanc...|$|E

40|$|Atomic force {{microscope}} (AFM) tip-based nanomachining {{is currently}} the object of intense research investigations. Values of the load applied to the tip at the free end of the AFM cantilever probe used for nanomachining are always large enough to induce plastic deformation on the specimen surface contrary to the small load values used for the conventional contact mode AFM imaging. This study describes an important phenomenon specific for AFM nanomachining in the forward direction: under certain processing conditions, the deformed shape of the cantilever probe may change from a convex to a concave orientation. The phenomenon can principally change the depth and width of <b>grooves</b> <b>machined,</b> e. g. the <b>grooves</b> <b>machined</b> on a single crystal copper specimen may increase by 50 % on average following such {{a change in the}} deformed shape of the cantilever. It is argued that this phenomenon can take place even when the AFM-based tool is operated in the so-called force-controlled mode. The study involves the refined theoretical analysis of cantilever probe bending, the analysis of experimental signals monitored during the backward and forward AFM tip-based machining and the inspection of the topography of produced grooves...|$|R
