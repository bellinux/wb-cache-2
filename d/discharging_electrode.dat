40|$|Currently used {{electrodes}} in a {{electrostatic precipitator}} (EP) mostly consist of long and slender wire, the vibration of which induces fatigue {{of the material}} and depresses its precipitating function. Structural modification of <b>discharge</b> <b>electrodes</b> {{is important for the}} best efficiency and the safe operation of EP. The subject of the present work is to investigate the method of the restraint of vibration by the use of the plate type EP which has zigzag arranged <b>discharge</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The amplitude of the vibration was measured {{as a function of the}} applied voltage, the displacement of <b>discharge</b> <b>electrode</b> and the number of <b>discharge</b> <b>electrodes.</b> The behavior of Ionic Wind was also obserbed by the use of Schrieren method. The experimental results indicate that the amplitude of electrode vibration in the modified system decreases in comparison with that of the plate type EP whose electrodes are mounted in its center.

40|$|Generally, the <b>discharge</b> <b>electrode</b> used in {{the large}} scale {{electrostatic}} precipitator (EP) is long elastic wire. The self-sustained vibration would be given rise to on such an electrode by electrostatic force due to the corona discharge. Although {{it is well known}} that the vibration of <b>discharge</b> <b>electrode</b> induces fatigue of material and depresses its precipitating function, the mechainsm of this particular vibration seems not to have been extensively studied. In order to clarify a mechanism of the vibration, we investigated a generation process of the negative damping force acting on the vibrational electrode by detecting a phase difference between the ripple of corona current having the same as vibration frequency and the vibrational displacement of the <b>discharge</b> <b>electrode.</b> The experimental results indicate that the ripple of corona current take place in 1 ∿ 3 msec following the displacement of <b>discharge</b> <b>electrode.</b> This effect can be explained in terms of, firstly, the modulation of the energy stored in ion space charge distribution, and secondly, the ion space charge relaxation time.

40|$|This work {{measures}} the penetration of ultra-fine particles through a single- and a two-stage ESPs {{as a function}} of particle size. Also studied herein are how parameters including particle size, rate of airflow through the ESP, and voltage of the <b>discharging</b> <b>electrode</b> affect aerosol penetration through the ESP. Monodisperse particles with sizes between 10 nm and 60 nm were generated as the challenge aerosols to investigate the particle charges given by an ESP. A comparison of experimental and theoretical results confirms that a partial charging regime exists when the particle diameter is several tens of nanometers. Experimental results indicated that aerosol penetration through the single- and two-stage ESPs increased significantly for particles below 20 and 50 nm, respectively. However, the exact regime depends on the parameters including air flow rate, applied voltage, and the configuration of the ESP.
