[...] "By Jove, sir!" [...] thus he would swear to you, with radiant face; sometimes, not often, by a deeper oath. With persons of dignity, especially with women, to whom he was always very gallant, he had courtly delicate manners, verging towards the wire-drawn and elaborate; on common occasions, he bloomed out at once into jolly familiarity of the gracefully boisterous kind, reminding you of mess-rooms and old Dublin days. His off-hand mode of speech was always precise, emphatic, ingenious: his laugh, which was frequent rather than otherwise, had a sincerity of banter, but no real depth of sense for the ludicrous; and soon ended, if it grew too loud, in a mere dissonant scream. He was broad, well-built, stout of stature; had a long lowish head, sharp gray eyes, with large strong aquiline face to match; and walked, or sat, in an erect decisive manner. A remarkable man; and playing, especially in those years 1830-40, a remarkable part in the world.|$|E

40|$|NASA space {{exploration}} should largely {{address a problem}} class in reliability and risk management stemming primarily from human error, system risk and multi-objective trade-off analysis, by conducting research into system complexity, risk characterization and modeling, and system reasoning. In general, in every mission we can distinguish risk in three possible ways: a) known-known, b) <b>known-unknown,</b> and c) unknown-unknown. It is probable almost certain that {{space exploration}} will partially experience similar known or unknown risks embedded in the Apollo missions, Shuttle or Station unless something alters how NASA will perceive and manage safety and reliability. 1...|$|E
40|$|High-resolution (HR) MS {{instruments}} recording HR-full scan allow {{analysts to}} go further beyond pre-acquisition choices. Untargeted acquisition can reveal unexpected compounds or concentrations and can be performed for preliminary diagnosis attempt. Then, revealed compounds {{will have to be}} identified for interpretations. Whereas the need of reference standards is mandatory to confirm identification, the diverse information collected from HRMS allows identifying unknown compounds with relatively high degree of confidence without reference standards injected in the same analytical sequence. However, there is a necessity to evaluate the degree of confidence in putative identifications, possibly before further targeted analyses. This is why a confidence scale and a score in the identification of (non-peptidic) <b>known-unknown,</b> defined as compounds with entries in database, is proposed for (LC-) HRMS data. The scale is based on two representative documents edited by the European Commission (2007 / 657 /EC) and the Metabolomics Standard Initiative (MSI), in an attempt to build a bridge between the communities of metabolomics and screening labs. With this confidence scale, an identification (ID) score is determined as [a number, a letter, and a number] (e. g., 2 D 3), from the following three criteria: I, a General Identification Category (1, confirmed, 2, putatively identified, 3, annotated compounds/classes, and 4, unknown); II, a Chromatography Class based on the relative retention time (from the narrowest tolerance, A, to no chromatographic references, D); and III, an Identification Point Level (1, very high, 2, high, and 3, normal level) {{based on the number of}} identification points collected. Three putative identification examples of <b>known-unknown</b> will be presented. Graphical Abstract ᅟ...|$|E
40|$|The program {{summary of}} the American Board of Surgery In-Service Training Exam (ABSITE) {{can be used to}} quantitate {{cognitive}} learning during a surgical residency and to identify areas of curricular weakness in a residency program. Knowledge on each question is categorized as high (known) or low (unknown) depending on the percentage of residents who answered correctly. Knowledge of Level 1 (entry) residents is then compared with Level 5 (exit) residents. Each ABSITE question can thus be categorized on entry versus exit as known-known, unknown-unknown, unknown-known, and <b>known-unknown.</b> Only about half of unknown knowledge on entry appears to become known on exit. Very little knowledge known on entry becomes unknown on exit. Weaknesses in specific subject areas can be readily identified by ranking questions according to the number of exiting residents who answer incorrectly. Use of this technique to quantitate cognitive learning in a residency program may allow objective assessment of changes in curriculum...|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} probability distributions {{given in}} the form of an oracle f: [n] → [m] that we can query. Here the probability Pf (j) of an outcome j ∈ [m] is the fraction of the domain that is mapped to j by f. We give quantum algorithms for testing whether two such distributions are identical or at least ɛ-far in L 1 -norm. Recently, Bravyi, Hassidim, and Harrow showed that if Pf and Pg are both unknown (i. e., given by oracles f and g), then this testing can be done in roughly √ m quantum queries. We consider the case where the second distribution is known, and show that testing can be done with roughly m 1 / 3 quantum queries, which is essentially optimal. In contrast, it is known that classical testing algorithms need about m 2 / 3 queries in the unknown-unknown case and about √ m queries in the <b>known-unknown</b> case. Our results can also be used to reduce the query complexity of graph isomorphism testers with quantum oracle access...|$|E
30|$|The tsunami {{waveform}} inversion {{analysis is}} based on the methodology proposed by Satake (1987). This methodology has been proven to be sufficiently powerful to estimate the fault slip distribution of a tsunamigenic earthquake, considering that most of the earthquake source occurs beneath the ocean bottom, particularly in subduction zones (Satake and Tanioka 1999; Fujii and Satake 2006; Adriano et al. 2016; Gusman et al. 2017). We construct the Green’s functions using the linear tsunami propagation from each sub-fault, assuming 1 unit slip. The initial seafloor deformation is calculated using a static deformation of a rectangular dislocation model (Okada 1992). In addition, the effect of the co-seismic horizontal displacement, in the region of steep bathymetric slopes (Tanioka and Satake 1996), is included. The tsunami amplitudes recorded at the offshore stations are approximately ten times smaller than those recorded at coastal gauges. To ensure equality on the tsunami amplitudes between the coastal tide gauge stations and the offshore wave gauge stations, a weight factor of 10 was applied to the offshore stations (Fujii et al. 2011). Furthermore, to avoid incorporating nonlinear components from the waveforms at coastal stations, we utilize only the first wave cycle of the synthetic and observed tsunami waveforms. The number of sub-faults satisfies the <b>known–unknown</b> variables condition in the inversion methodology described by Satake (1987). The slip of each sub-fault is estimated using the non-negative least square method, and its corresponding error is calculated using the jackknife method (Fujii and Satake 2006, 2007).|$|E
40|$|We present {{several new}} {{examples}} of speed-ups obtainable by quantum algorithms {{in the context}} of property testing. First, motivated by sampling algorithms, we consider probability distributions given {{in the form of an}} oracle f: [n] → [m]. Here the probability P f (j) of an outcome j ∈ [m] is the fraction of its domain that f maps to j. We give quantum algorithms for testing whether two such distributions are identical or ɛ-far in L 1 -norm. Recently, Bravyi, Hassidim, and Harrow [11] showed that if P f and Pg are both unknown (i. e., given by oracles f and g), then this testing can be done in roughly √ m quantum queries to the functions. We consider the case where the second distribution is known, and show that testing can be done with roughly m 1 / 3 quantum queries, which we prove to be essentially optimal. In contrast, it is known that classical testing algorithms need about m 2 / 3 queries in the unknown-unknown case and about √ m queries in the <b>known-unknown</b> case. Based on this result, we also reduce the query complexity of graph isomorphism testers with quantum oracle access. While those examples provide polynomial quantum speed-ups, our third example gives a much larger improvement (constant quantum queries vs polynomial classical queries) for the problem of testing periodicity, based on Shor’s algorithm and a modification of a classical lower bound by Lachish and Newman [30]. This provides an alternative to a recent constant-vs-polynomial speed-up due to Aaronson [1]...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} I {{approach}} {{the question of}} passive choice in Swedish from a lexical perspective. Swedish has two types of passive, a morphological passive formed with the ending-s and a periphrastic passive formed with an auxiliary and the past participle of the verb. The latter passive has two variants, the bli-passive and the vara-passive with different auxiliaries (bli ‘become’, vara ‘be’). The s-passive is the unmarked passive, whereas the periphrastic passive is subject to restrictions of use. The overall reasons for the choice between the two passives is well known, but {{a great deal of}} variation can be detected behind the neat general patterns. Searches in a corpus of about 40 million words reveal that only a few verbs are frequently used in more than one passive type, but even so, there are such verbs. Factors turning up behind the alternation – additional to verb meaning and type of subject – are text type, genre, semantic frame, and the dimension <b>known–unknown</b> for the subject. Moreover, many collocational patterns appear, and to some extent, no clear reason for a choice can be found. On the basis of these variable patterns I discuss the problems of describing constructions. What factors belong to which level of generality of the description? Is the text type or frame, for instance, a general factor or is it verb specific? Do statistical data need to be accounted for? In my study I present more questions than I have answers for. For me, with a background in lexicography, Construction Grammar is an appealing theory since it takes meaning into account; but the ambition to describe “everything” through the same formality and to include all phenomena between syntax and lexicon is a challenge. 1...|$|E
40|$|Trabajo presentado a la XV Reunión Científica de la Sociedad Española de Cromatografía y Técnicas Afines (SECyTA) celebrada en Castellón de la Plana del 28 al 30 de octubre de 2015 Comprehensive gas {{chromatography}} coupled to a time-of-flight mass spectrometer analyzer (GC×GC−TOF MS) {{is recognized as}} a powerful separation technique that, when combined with an appropriate (generic) sample preparation technique, can provide information simultaneously for targeted and non-targeted compounds [1]. In this type of study, the feasibility of the technique to generate structured chromatograms is an additional feature {{that contributes to the}} identification of analytes and families of analytes for which standards are not available and so to the (virtual) identification of <b>known-unknown</b> and unknown compounds when only mass spectral information is available. However, when analyzing complex extracts, the manual inspection of all compounds detected, even for a particular region of the contour plot, can be a tedious and laborious work. For these types of samples, when the interest focus on a particular category of compounds, the use of classification tools can effectively contribute to further reduce the initial data set through its automatic filtering on the base of, for example, specific structural characteristics. In this work, classifications and scripts (mass spectral filtering) software was employed to process data generated using GC×GC−ToF MS for bluefin tuna muscles subjected to a rather generic sample preparation procedure, i. e. Soxhlet extraction and acidic fat removal [1]. The script function was based on that reported on [2] and described to recognize a generic halogenated isotope cluster pattern. Therefore, in practice, it allowed the automatic and simultaneous filtering and visualization on the contour plot of the detected chlorinated, brominated, or mixed Cl-Br compounds in the investigated samples. Once optimized, the proposed scripting and classification tool allowed the successful classification of 96...|$|E
30|$|Narendra et al. {{directly}} {{applied a}} summarizer, MEAD for selecting informative sentences for automatic CQs generation (Narendra, Agarwal, & Shah, 2013). Correia et al. used {{supervised machine learning}} technique for selecting stem to generate cloze question. They utilized a set of features like sentence length, word position, chunk, parts-of-speech, named entity, verb domain, <b>known-unknown</b> word, acronym etc. to run Support Vector Machine classifier (Correia, Baptista, Eskenazi, & Mamede, 2012). Agarwal and Mannem described a system for generating gap-fill questions from a biology textbook. They used a number of features like {{the position of the}} sentence in a document, is it the first sentence, contains token that occurs in the title, length, number of nouns and pronouns etc, whether it contains abbreviation or superlatives. But they had not clearly reported how the features were combined, what should be the optimum value of these features or whether there was any relative weight among the features (Agarwal & Mannem, 2011). Pino et al. used a set of criteria like well-defined context, probabilistic context-free grammar score, the number of tokens and the number of clauses. They also manually calculated a sentence’s score based on the occurrence of these criteria in a given sentence and identified the sentence as informative if the score was higher than a threshold (Pino et al., 2008). Hoshino and Nakagawa presented a semi-automatic system to assist teachers in order to produce cloze test items, based on online news articles. In their system, cloze test items were generated by removing one or more words from a passage and the learners were asked to fill the missing words. The system generated two types of distractors: grammar distractors and vocabulary distractors. User evaluation disclosed that 80 % of the generated items were considered as suitable (Hoshino & Nakagawa, 2007). Silveira described a general framework for question generation. The input to the system was free text, which was parsed and annotated with metadata. Once annotated, an appropriate question model was selected, and then the question was formulated using natural language (Silveira, 2008). Brown et al. developed a system to generate vocabulary assessment questions automatically. In this task they used WordNet for finding the synonym, antonym, hyponym etc. in order to develop the questions and the distractors (Brown et al., 2005; Miller, 1995).|$|E
