25|$|Interval <b>debulking</b> {{surgery is}} another {{protocol}} used, where neoadjuvant chemotherapy is given, <b>debulking</b> surgery is performed, and chemotherapy is finished after <b>debulking.</b> Though no definitive {{studies have been}} completed, it is shown to be approximately equivalent to primary <b>debulking</b> surgery in terms of survival, and shows slightly lower morbidity.|$|E
25|$|In {{advanced}} cancers, where {{complete removal}} {{is not an}} option, as much tumor as possible is removed in a procedure called <b>debulking</b> surgery. This surgery is not always successful, and {{is less likely to}} be successful in women with extensive metastases in the peritoneum, stage- IV disease, cancer in the transverse fissure of the liver, mesentery, or diaphragm, and large areas of ascites. <b>Debulking</b> surgery is usually only done once. More complete <b>debulking</b> is associated with better outcomes: women with no macroscopic evidence of disease after <b>debulking</b> have a median survival of 39 months, as opposed to 17 months with less complete surgery. By removing metastases, many cells that are resistant to chemotherapy are removed, and any clumps of cells that have died are also removed. This allows chemotherapy to better reach the remaining cancer cells, which {{are more likely to be}} fast-growing and therefore chemosensitive.|$|E
25|$|The cells {{which are}} {{actively}} undergoing cell cycle are targeted in cancer therapy as the DNA is relatively exposed during cell division and hence susceptible to damage by drugs or radiation. This fact is {{made use of}} in cancer treatment; by {{a process known as}} <b>debulking,</b> a significant mass of the tumor is removed which pushes a significant number of the remaining tumor cells from G0 to G1 phase (due to increased availability of nutrients, oxygen, growth factors etc.). Radiation or chemotherapy following the <b>debulking</b> procedure kills these cells which have newly entered the cell cycle.|$|E
40|$|Despite the {{existence}} of morphologically indistinguishable disease, patients with advanced ovarian tumors display {{a broad range of}} survival end points. We hypothesize that gene expression profiling can identify a prognostic signature accounting for these distinct clinical outcomes. To resolve survival-associated loci, gene expression profiling was completed for an extensive set of 185 (90 optimal/ 95 suboptimal) primary ovarian tumors using the Affymetrix human U 133 A microarray. Cox regression analysis identified probe sets associated with survival in optimally and suboptimally <b>debulked</b> tumor sets at a P value of 3 ̆c 0. 01. Leave-one-out cross-validation was applied to each tumor cohort and confirmed by a permutation test. External validation was conducted by applying the gene signature to a publicly available array database of expression profiles of advanced stage suboptimally <b>debulked</b> tumors. The prognostic signature successfully classified the tumors according to survival for suboptimally (P = 0. 0179) but not optimally <b>debulked</b> (P = 0. 144) patients. The suboptimal gene signature was validated using the independent set of tumors (odds ratio, 8. 75; P = 0. 0146). To elucidate signaling events amenable to therapeutic intervention in suboptimally <b>debulked</b> patients, pathway analysis was completed for the top 57 survival-associated probe sets. For suboptimally <b>debulked</b> patients, confirmation of the predictive gene signature supports {{the existence}} of a clinically relevant predictor, as well as the possibility of novel therapeutic opportunities. Ultimately, the prognostic classifier defined for suboptimally <b>debulked</b> tumors may aid in the classification and enhancement of patient outcome for this high-risk population...|$|R
30|$|Most uteri were <b>debulked</b> transabdominally {{using the}} S.E.M.M. Moto-Drive 15 -mm {{mechanical}} morcellator (WISAP) through the left-hand port. In some cases {{where there was}} generous access from below, the mass was <b>debulked</b> vaginally. The uterine remnant was then removed trans-vaginally. The vagina was then sutured laparoscopically under direct vision. All patient data, including any operative difficulties, intraoperative and postoperative complications, were prospectively collected as a database.|$|R
30|$|Stoval {{and colleagues}} have used gonadotrophin-releasing hormone (GnRH) {{agonists}} as a preoperative adjunct to medically <b>debulk</b> uteri, thus enabling hysterectomy, which {{otherwise would have}} been approached abdominally, to be performed vaginally [12].|$|R
25|$|Physicians {{sometimes}} use {{the term}} palliative care in a sense meaning palliative therapies without curative intent, when no cure can be expected (as often happens in late-stage cancers). For example, tumor <b>debulking</b> can continue to reduce pain from mass effect {{even when it is}} no longer curative. A clearer usage is palliative, noncurative therapy when that is what is meant, because palliative care can be used along with curative or aggressive therapies.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} {{different}} surgical procedures {{that can be}} employed to treat ovarian cancer. For stage I and II cancer, laparascopic (keyhole) surgery can be used, but metastases may not be found. For advanced cancer, laparoscopy is not used, since <b>debulking</b> metastases requires access to the entire peritoneal cavity. Depending {{on the extent of}} the cancer, procedures may include a bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, biopsies throughout the peritoneum and abdominal lymphatic system, omentectomy, splenectomy, bowel resection, diaphragm stripping or resection, appendectomy, or even a posterior pelvic exenteration.|$|E
25|$|PTFE film is also {{widely used}} in the {{production}} of carbon fiber composites as well as fiberglass composites, notably in the aerospace industry. PTFE film is used as a barrier between the carbon or fiberglass part being built, and breather and bagging materials used to incapsulate the bondment when <b>debulking</b> (vacuum removal of air from between layers of laid-up plies of material) and when curing the composite, usually in an autoclave. The PTFE, used here as a film, prevents the non-production materials from sticking to the part being built, which is sticky due to the carbon-graphite or fiberglass plies being pre-pregnated with bismaleimide resin. Non-production materials such as Teflon, Airweave Breather and the bag itself would be considered F.O.D. (foreign object debris/damage) if left in layup.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Suboptimally <b>debulked</b> {{patients}} with advanced ovarian cancer who {{are treated with}} a combination of cisplatin plus paclitaxel (TP therapy) have a better survival as compared to patients treated {{with a combination of}} cisplatin plus cyclophosphamide (CP therapy), but this advantage has not been demonstrated in optimally <b>debulked</b> patients. We performed a retrospective study to compare the effectiveness of TP therapy and CP therapy in optimally <b>debulked</b> patients. STUDY DESIGN: From 1991 to 1996, 87 consecutive {{patients with}} advanced ovarian cancer treated in the University Hospital Utrecht and the St. Antonius Hospital were included in the study. Overall survival (OS) of patients treated with TP or CP were compared. Multivariable Cox-regression analysis was used to calculate a hazard rate ratio (HRR) for OS. RESULTS: In the study period, 51 patients were treated with CP, and 36 patients were treated with TP. In the 18 patients with a tumorrest > 2 cm, there was a clear, but not statistically significant benefit from TP. In 69 patients with a tumorrest <or= 2 cm, life expectancy was not increased in patients treated with TP as compared to patients treated with CP (HRR 0. 9 (95 % CI 0. 4 - 1. 9)). CONCLUSION: We could not show that ovarian cancer patients with residual disease of <or= 2 cm who were treated with TP had better survival as compared to patients who were treated with CP. Taking into account the high costs of treatment with TP, a randomized trial comparing the effects of TP therapy and CP therapy in optimally <b>debulked</b> patients is warrante...|$|R
40|$|Voids in {{composites}} {{have been}} a perennial problem, since the amount of porosities is deemed to bear a strong relation with the degradation of service performance of laminates. On the other side, the effect of porosity on impact resistance of laminates is often dependant on their distribution in the material, especially {{with respect to the}} location and severity of impact damage in it. In this study, the influence of void content percentage on the residual flexural strength of CFRP laminates impacted at very low energy, in the region of 1 J, at different temperatures was investigated. Laminates were fabricated using 16 layers of Cycom 977 - 2 prepreg material in a [0 / 90 / 90 / 0] 2 S layup with different void contents in the range from 1 to 7 % by varying cure conditions. Low velocity impact tests were conducted on three categories of laminates, defined as high pressure cured, low pressure <b>debulked</b> and low pressure non <b>debulked</b> respectively, each of these at ambient temperature (30 °C) and elevated temperatures of 50, 70 and 90 °C. Post-impact residual flexural strength of the laminates was measured by three-point bending tests followed in real time by acoustic emission (AE) monitoring. From the separation of frequency bands and of their amplitude levels, identification of the different failure modes, such as matrix cracking, delamination and fibre failure, was performed. The results indicated {{that in the case of}} very low impact energy high porosity laminates, such as non <b>debulked</b> ones, may possess slightly higher residual flexural strength and an enhanced delamination resistance with respect to <b>debulked</b> ones...|$|R

50|$|<b>Debulking</b> {{has been}} the most common {{treatment}} for KTS for several decades and while improvements have been made, the procedure is still considered invasive and has several risks associated with it. More effective and less invasive treatment choices now exist for KTS patients and therefore <b>debulking</b> is generally only recommended as a last resort. <b>Debulking</b> operations can result in major deformities and also leave patients with permanent nerve damage.|$|E
50|$|In {{other types}} of cancer where <b>debulking</b> is not curative, it is {{sometimes}} done with palliative intent to relieve mass effect. For example, tumors whose bulk presses on the lungs or esophagus can impair breathing or swallowing, in which case <b>debulking</b> can improve {{quality of life and}} extend survival regardless of not curing the cancer.|$|E
40|$|Recently {{developed}} epoxy paste adhesives were {{electron beam}} cured and experimentally explored {{to determine their}} suitability for use in an aerospace-quality aircraft component. There were two major goals for this program. The first {{was to determine whether}} the electron beam-curable past adhesives were capable of meeting the requirements of the US Air Force T- 38 supersonic jet trainer composite windshield frame. The T- 38 windshield frame`s arch is currently manufactured by bonding thin stainless steel plies using an aerospace-grade thermally-cured epoxy film adhesive. The second goal was to develop the lowest cost hand layup and <b>debulk</b> process {{that could be used to}} produce laminated steel plies with acceptable properties. The laminate properties examined to determine adhesive suitability include laminate mechanical and physical properties at room, adhesive tack, out-time capability, and the <b>debulk</b> requirements needed to achieve these properties. Eighteen past adhesives and four scrim cloths were experimentally examined using this criteria. One paste adhesive was found to have suitable characteristics in each of these categories and was later chosen for the manufacture of the T- 38 windshield frame. This experimental study shows that by using low-cost <b>debulk</b> and layup processes, the electron beam-cured past adhesive mechanical and physical properties meet the specifications of the T- 38 composite windshield frame...|$|R

40|$|Purpose Studies {{indicate}} that ovarian cancer {{patients who have}} been optimally <b>debulked</b> survive longer.

The Scottish Randomised Trial in Ovarian Cancer surgical study is a prospective observational study examining the impact on progression-free survival (PFS) of cytoreductive surgery and international variations in surgical practice. Patients and Methods One thousand seventy-seven patients were recruited (UK, n = 689; Europe, United States, and Australasia, n = 388). Surgical data were available for 889 patients.

5000|$|<b>Debulking</b> is the {{reduction}} of {{as much of the}} bulk (volume) of a tumour as possible. It is usually achieved by surgical removal. It is also known as cytoreduction or cytoreductive surgery (CRS); [...] "cytoreduction" [...] refers to reducing the number of tumor cells. <b>Debulking</b> is used with curative intent in only some types of cancer, as generally partial removal of a malignant tumor is not a worthwhile intervention for curative purposes (because malignant cells left behind soon multiply and renew the threat). Ovarian cancer and some types of brain tumor are debulked before radiotherapy or chemotherapy begin, making those therapies more effective. It may also be used in the case of slow-growing tumors to shift tumor cells from phase of cell cycle to replicative pool.|$|E
50|$|Mayo Clinic has {{reported}} the largest experience in managing KTS with major surgery. In 39 years at Mayo clinic the surgery team evaluated 252 consecutive cases of KTS, of which only 145 (57.5%) could {{be treated by}} primary surgery.
