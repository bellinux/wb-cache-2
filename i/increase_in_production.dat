5|$|By {{the late}} 1890s, Amarillo had {{emerged as one}} of the world's busiest cattle-shipping points, and its {{population}} grew significantly. The city became a grain elevator, milling, and feed-manufacturing center after an <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> of wheat and small grains during the early 1900s. Discovery of natural gas in 1918 and oil three years later brought oil and gas companies to the Amarillo area.|$|E

50|$|Other {{food crops}} have {{witnessed}} small <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> from 1985 to 1992. Cassava, {{the second major}} food crop in terms of area planted (almost everywhere on the island) and probably <b>in</b> quantity consumed, <b>increased</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> from 2.14 million tons in 1985 to 2.32 million tons in 1992. During this same period, corn production increased from 140,000 tons to 165,000 tons, sweet potato production increased from 450,000 tons to 487,000 tons, and bananas dropped slightly from 255,000 tons to 220,000 tons.|$|R
5|$|The {{development}} of a three-field rotation system for planting crops increased the usage of land from one half in use each year under the old two-field system to two-thirds under the new system, with a consequent <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>production.</b> The {{development of}} the heavy plough allowed heavier soils to be farmed more efficiently, aided by {{the spread of the}} horse collar, which led to the use of draught horses in place of oxen. Horses are faster than oxen and require less pasture, factors that aided the implementation of the three-field system.|$|E
5|$|Star Breweries {{invested}} {{over four}} million euros into improving its {{factories in the}} 2009-11 period, resulting in a 20% <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> capacity. These improvements included refurbishing the production line equipment, including higher performing mixers and belts and a new bottle conveyor system. The Coca-Cola Company issued international HACCP certification to Star Breweries in 2010, confirming its adherence to international quality standards in beverage production. In 2011, Coca-Cola also awarded Star Breweries the Gold Medal among 27 competing African countries for the company's standards of quality and environmental protection {{in the production of}} its beer and other beverages. Frequent brownouts resulting from the overtaxed national power grid produce power cuts to the THB breweries that have negatively affected the volume and cost effectiveness of production since the early 2000s.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate isomerization, conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003â€“2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E

5|$|At {{its peak}} {{at the end}} of the 19th century, the U.S. ice trade {{employed}} an estimated 90,000 people in an industry capitalised at $28 million ($660 million in 2010 terms), using ice houses capable of storing up to 250,000 tons (220 million kg) each; Norway exported a million tons (910 million kg) of ice a year, drawing on a network of artificial lakes. Competition had slowly been growing, however, in the form of artificially produced plant ice and mechanically chilled facilities. Unreliable and expensive at first, plant ice began to successfully compete with natural ice in Australia and India during the 1850s and 1870s respectively, until, by the outbreak of World War I in 1914, more plant ice was being produced in the U.S. each year than naturally harvested ice. Despite a temporary <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> in the U.S. during the war, the inter-war years saw the total collapse of the ice trade around the world. Today, ice is occasionally harvested for ice carving and ice festivals, but little remains of the 19th-century industrial network of ice houses and transport facilities.|$|E

40|$|We compare two dynamic {{models for}} {{explaining}} {{the evolution of}} Agriculture production and relative prices {{during the second half}} of the 20 th century in four OECD countries, and we find more support for the recursive system than for the interdependent model. The important <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> <b>in</b> the USA, promoted by incentives to boost crops, have also influenced the technological diffusion in other countries with similar results of <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> by territorial unity. This has implied a growth of supply higher than the growth of demand, for a given level of real prices, and thus it has provoked a diminution in this last variable. Agriculture production plays an important role in economic growth, not only through external trade, which favours a diminution of imports and an increase of exports, but also through an <b>increase</b> of <b>production</b> <b>in</b> non-agrarian sectors from demand and supply sides, so we conclude that the sector should continue to receive aids to compensate for the fall in prices and maintain real income from farm and related activities. ...|$|R

25|$|This <b>increase</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> {{is largely}} {{the result of}} the removal of {{barriers}} to entry and increased competition; the number of industrial firms rose from 377,300 in 1980 to nearly 8 million in 1990 and 1996; the 2004 economic census, which excluded enterprises with annual sales below RMB 5million, counted 1.33million manufacturing firms, with Jiangsu and Zhejiang reporting more firms than the nationwide total for 1980. Compared to other East Asian industrial growth spurts, China's industrial performance exceeded Japan's but remained behind South Korea and Taiwan's economies.|$|E
25|$|Despite these setbacks, Borlaug found encouragement.

40|$|This study {{develops}} {{and tests}} the hubris theory of entrepreneurship {{as a means}} to explain the variation in failure rates amongst de novo ventures, complementing escalation and other behavioral explanations.

In contrast to previous studies, we reason that overconfidence is more likely in situations where there is no dominant arch competitor for the focal de novo venture (i. e., low arch incumbency). Using data from the European passenger airline industry, we find empirical support that that overconfidence provides an adequate explanation for rapid <b>increases</b> <b>in</b> <b>production</b> capacity <b>in</b> de novo ventures, which in turn, provides a mediating (suppressing) pathway linking arch incumbency to firm failure...|$|R
