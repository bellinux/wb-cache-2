5|$|Also {{included}} {{in the category of}} <b>Kurdish</b> geographical name changes are Zazaki, which is considered among <b>Kurdish</b> group, along with Kurmanci. Nişanyan estimates that 4,000 <b>Kurdish</b> geographical locations have been changed.|$|E
5|$|According to the Syrian authorities, {{the camp}} of archaeologists was looted, {{along with the}} tools and {{ceramics}} kept in it. The site changed hands between the different combatants, mainly the <b>Kurdish</b> People's Protection Units and the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant. In early 2015, Tell Brak {{was taken by the}} <b>Kurdish</b> forces after light fighting with the Islamic State.|$|E
5|$|By 1927, all {{street and}} square names in Istanbul {{which were not}} of Turkish origin were changed. The {{campaign}} continued until 1978, and was reintroduced after the military coup of 1980 in 1981–83. During the heightened tension between <b>Kurdish</b> rebels and the Turkish government, the focus of geographical name changing in the 1980s was on <b>Kurdish</b> villages, towns, rivers, etc.|$|E
5|$|Many of {{them were}} {{relocated}} to refugee camps by the British in Baquba and later to Habbaniyah, and in 1921 some were enlisted in the pro-British Assyrian Levies which helped quell <b>Kurdish</b> revolts in the British Mandate of Mesopotamia. Most Hakkari Assyrians were resettled after 1925 in a cluster of villages in northern Iraq. Some of the villages where the Assyrians settled were leased directly by the government, while others belonged to <b>Kurdish</b> landlords who {{had the right to}} evict them at any time.|$|E
5|$|On 19 August 2016, two F-22s intercepted two Syrian Su-24 strike {{aircraft}} over Hasakah, Syria, following SyAAF attacks on U.S.-backed <b>Kurdish</b> forces {{in and around}} the city.|$|E
5|$|On 7 April 1991, Iraq {{accepted}} United Nations (UN) cease-fire {{conditions and}} resolutions, thereby officially ending the Gulf War. This same day, a large multinational, multiple-agency humanitarian effort {{under the authority}} of UN Security Council Resolution No. 688 began to aid the approximately 500,000 <b>Kurdish</b> refugees who had fled from Iraqi military forces into the hills of northern Iraq. On 18 April 1991, John Shalikashvili took command of the U.S.-led operation to ensure security for UN relief operations and the <b>Kurdish</b> refugees, called Operation Provide Comfort (OPC).|$|E
5|$|The <b>Kurdish</b> {{geographical}} name changes were exempt under the Ottoman Empire {{due to the}} Islamic religious orientation of Kurds. During the Republican era and especially after the Dersim massacre, <b>Kurdish</b> {{geographical name}} changes became more common. During the Turkish Republican era, the words Kurdistan and Kurds were banned. The Turkish government had disguised {{the presence of the}} Kurds statistically by categorizing them as Mountain Turks. This classification was changed to the new euphemism of Eastern Turk in 1980.|$|E

5|$|The {{progenitor}} of the Ayyubid dynasty, Najm ad-Din Ayyub ibn Shadhi, {{belonged to}} the <b>Kurdish</b> Rawadiya tribe, itself {{a branch of the}} Hadhabani confederation. Ayyub's ancestors settled in the town of Dvin, in northern Armenia. The Rawadiya were the dominant <b>Kurdish</b> group in the Dvin district, forming part of the political-military elite of the town.|$|E
5|$|While these killings {{were taking}} place, nearby <b>Kurdish,</b> Arab and Yazidi tribes were {{encouraged}} to loot Assyrian villages. <b>Kurdish</b> tribes of Gulli, Sindi and Selivani were encouraged by the mayor of Zakho to loot villages to the northeast of Simele, while Yazidis and Kurds also raided Assyrian villages in Shekhan and Amadiya. Most women and children from those villages took refuge in Simele and Dohuk.|$|E
5|$|According to 2016 Global Peace Index, Turkey ranked 145th out of 163 {{countries}} in the world, mainly because of its conflict with <b>Kurdish</b> insurgents, its invasion of Cyprus and the military intervention in Syria.|$|E
5|$|In 1984, the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK), a <b>Kurdish</b> separatist group (listed as a {{terrorist}} organization by NATO, the United States and the European Union), began an armed insurgency campaign against Turkey. The conflict has claimed over 40,000 lives to date.|$|E
5|$|In 750 CE, {{the last}} Umayyad caliph Marwan II was {{defeated}} by the Abbasid As-Saffah in the Battle of the Zab {{on the banks of}} the Khazir River, a tributary to the Great Zab. When the Mongols swept over Iraq in the 13th century and sacked Arbil, many survivors sought a refuge in the inaccessible valleys of the Great Zab. The Sapna Valley was home to both Christian and Muslim communities, as evidenced by Christian artefacts found at Zawi Chemi Shanidar. During the 19th century, the area was controlled by local <b>Kurdish</b> leaders. During World War I, heavy fighting took place in the area, and Rowanduz was pillaged by Russian soldiers in 1916. Following World War I, episodes of heavy fighting took place between the Barzani tribe – striving for the establishment of an independent <b>Kurdish</b> polity – and several other <b>Kurdish</b> tribes, and between the Barzanis and the Iraqi Government. The last of these uprisings started in 1974 and led to heavy bombardments of towns and villages in the Great Zab basin.|$|E
5|$|Kubba is a dish made of rice/semolina/burghul (cracked wheat), minced {{onions and}} finely ground lean beef, lamb or chicken. The best-known variety is a torpedo-shaped fried croquette stuffed with minced beef, chicken or lamb. It {{was brought to}} Israel by Jews of Iraqi, <b>Kurdish</b> and Syrian origin.|$|E
5|$|The Ayyubids {{generally}} employed Kurds, Turks, {{and people}} from the Caucasus for the higher-ranking posts {{of the military and}} bureaucratic fields. Not much is known about the foot soldiers of the Ayyubid army, but the numbers of cavalrymen are known to have fluctuated between 8,500 and 12,000. The cavalry was largely composed of free-born Kurds, Turks, and Turkomans whom Ayyubid emirs and sultans purchased as slaves (mamluks). In addition, there existed Arab auxiliaries, former Fatimid units such as the Nubians, and separate Arab contingents—notably from the Kinaniyya tribe, who were largely devoted to the defense of Egypt. Rivalry between <b>Kurdish</b> and Turkish troops occurred occasionally when leading positions were at stake and towards the end of Ayyubid rule, Turks outnumbered Kurds in the army. Despite their <b>Kurdish</b> background, the sultans remained impartial to both groups.|$|E
5|$|The Iraqi Army, led by Bakr Sidqi, an {{experienced}} brigadier general, an Iraqi nationalist and general of <b>Kurdish</b> origin, {{although not a}} <b>Kurdish</b> nationalist, moved north in order to crush the Assyrian revolt. The Iraqi forces started executing every Assyrian male found in the mountainous Bekher region between Zakho and Duhok starting from 8 August 1933. Assyrian civilians were transported in military trucks from Zakho and Dohuk to uninhabited places, in batches of eight or ten, where they were shot with machine guns and run over by heavy armoured cars {{to make sure no}} one survived.|$|E
5|$|The Iraqis, on {{the other}} hand felt that the Assyrians' demands were, {{alongside}} the <b>Kurdish</b> disturbances in the north, a conspiracy by the British to divide Iraq by agitating its minorities.|$|E
5|$|The Kurds are {{the largest}} non-Turkic ethnicity, around 18–25 percent of the population. Kurds are {{concentrated}} {{in the east and}} southeast of the country, in what is also known as Turkish Kurdistan, making up a majority in the provinces of Tunceli, Bingöl, Muş, Ağrı, Iğdır, Elâzığ, Diyarbakır, Batman, Şırnak, Bitlis, Van, Mardin, Siirt and Hakkari, a near majority in Şanlıurfa province (47%), and a large minority in Kars province (20%). In addition, due to internal migration, <b>Kurdish</b> communities exist in all major cities in central and western Turkey, particularly in Istanbul, where there are an estimated 3 million Kurds, making Istanbul the city with the largest <b>Kurdish</b> population in the world. The minorities besides the Kurds are thought to make up an estimated 7–12 percent of the population.|$|E
5|$|The first clashes {{took place}} in January 1904 between the fedayi and <b>Kurdish</b> irregulars {{supported}} by the Ottoman government. The Turkish offensive started in early April with an estimated 10,000 to 20,000 soldiers and 7,000 <b>Kurdish</b> irregulars put against 100 to 200 Armenian fedayi and 700 to 1,000 local Armenian men. Hrayr was killed during the intense fighting; Andranik survived and resumed the fight. Between 7,000 and 10,000 Armenian civilians were killed during the two months of the uprising, while about 9,000 were left homeless. Around 4,000 Sasun villagers were forced into exile after the uprising.|$|E
5|$|After 1948, the {{greatest}} impact came from the large migration of Jews from Turkey, Iraq, Kurdistan and Yemen, and Mizrahi Jews from North Africa, particularly Morocco. Typically, the staff of army kitchens, schools, hospitals, hotels and restaurant kitchens has consisted of Mizrahi, <b>Kurdish</b> and Yemenite Jews, and this has had an influence on the cooking fashions and ingredients of the country.|$|E
5|$|After {{acquiring}} {{the site in}} 1142, they began building a new castle to replace the former <b>Kurdish</b> fortification. This work lasted until 1170, when an earthquake damaged the castle. An Arab source mentions that the quake destroyed the castle's chapel, which {{was replaced by the}} present chapel. In 1163 the Crusaders emerged victorious over Nur ad-Din in the Battle of al-Buqaia near Krak des Chevaliers.|$|E
5|$|Efforts at {{restoring}} the former names of geographical terms have been recently introduced in Turkey. In September 2012, legislation {{was introduced to}} restore the names of (primarily <b>Kurdish)</b> villages to their former native names. According to the bill, the province of Tunceli would be named Dersim, Güroymak would be named Norşin, and Aydınlar would be named Tilo.|$|E
5|$|Human {{rights in}} Turkey {{have been the}} subject of some {{controversy}} and international condemnation. Between 1998 and 2008 the European Court of Human Rights made more than 1,600 judgements against Turkey for human rights violations, particularly regarding the right to life, and freedom from torture. Other issues, such as <b>Kurdish</b> rights, women's rights, LGBT rights, and press freedom, have also attracted controversy. Turkey's human rights record continues to be a significant obstacle to future membership of the EU.|$|E
5|$|Hussein Saeed {{was born}} on 21 January 1958 in Al Adhamiya, {{where most of the}} Al-Ubaid tribe lived, to a {{conservative}} Baghdadi family. His mother is of <b>Kurdish</b> descent and was born in Arbil while his father is an Arab. The family moved from Al Adhamiya to live in Al-Iskan when his father, who had previously worked as a fabrics merchant, got a job in the Ministry of Construction and Housing.|$|E
5|$|In 1199, Tamar's armies led by two Christianised <b>Kurdish</b> generals, Zak'are and Ivane Zakarid-Mkhargrzeli, {{dislodged}} the Shaddadid dynasty from Ani, the erstwhile {{capital of}} the Armenian kingdom, and received it from the queen as their fief. From their base at Ani, the brothers surged ahead into the central Armenian lands, reclaiming one after another fortresses and districts from local Muslim rulers: Bjni was taken in 1201 and Dvin fell in 1203.|$|E
5|$|On 24 October 2014, it was {{reported}} that the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant had used chlorine gas in the town of Duluiyah, Iraq. Laboratory analysis of clothing and soil samples confirmed the use of chlorine gas against <b>Kurdish</b> Peshmerga Forces in a vehicle-borne improvised explosive device attack on 23 January 2015 at the Highway 47 Kiske Junction near Mosul.|$|E
5|$|Particularly on holidays, dumplings {{are served}} with the soup, such as the kneidlach (matzah balls) of the Ashkenazim or the gondi (chickpea dumplings) of Iranian Jews, or kubba, a family of dumplings brought to Israel by Middle Eastern Jews. Especially popular are kubba {{prepared}} from bulgur and stuffed with ground lamb and pine nuts, and the soft semolina or rice kubba cooked in soup, which Jews of <b>Kurdish</b> or Iraqi heritage habitually enjoy as a Friday lunchtime meal.|$|E
5|$|Recognised native {{minority}} {{languages in}} Germany are Danish, Low German, Sorbian, Romany, North Frisian and Saterland Frisian; they are officially {{protected by the}} European Charter for Regional or Minority Languages. The most used immigrant languages are Turkish, <b>Kurdish,</b> Polish, the Balkan languages, and Russian. Germans are typically multilingual: 67% of German citizens claim {{to be able to}} communicate in at least one foreign language and 27% in at least two.|$|E
5|$|The Chinook {{became a}} vital transit tool during the 1991 Gulf War in Iraq. They {{were used for}} moving troops into the region {{at the start of}} the conflict; a Chinook was used on 22 January 1991 to {{transport}} a Special Air Service (SAS) patrol on the infamous Bravo Two Zero mission. In the aftermath of the conflict as many as nine British Chinooks delivered food and supplies to thousands of <b>Kurdish</b> refugees from Iraq.|$|E
5|$|The Khanasor Expedition was {{performed}} by the Armenian militia against the <b>Kurdish</b> Mazrik tribe on July 25, 1897. During the Defense of Van, the Mazrik tribe had ambushed a squad of Armenian defenders and massacred them. The Khanasor Expedition was the ARF's retaliation. Some Armenians consider this their first victory over the Ottoman Empire and celebrate each year in its remembrance.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} Iraqi {{account that}} the Assyrian casualties were sustained during a short battle with <b>Kurdish</b> and Arab tribes has been discredited by all historians. Khaldun Husry {{claims that the}} mass killing was not premeditated and that the responsibility lies {{on the shoulders of}} Ismael Abbawi, a junior officer in the army.|$|E
5|$|Turkey {{used its}} F-16s {{extensively}} in its conflict with separatist Kurds in <b>Kurdish</b> parts of Turkey and Iraq. Turkey launched its first cross-border raid on 16 December 2007, {{a prelude to}} the 2008 Turkish incursion into northern Iraq, involving 50 fighters before Operation Sun. This {{was the first time}} Turkey had mounted a night-bombing operation on a massive scale, and also the largest operation conducted by Turkish Air Force.|$|E
5|$|Under American protection, Iraqi Kurdistan {{had evolved}} into a {{successful}} semi-autonomous region. US pressure helped lead to a peace deal in 1999 between the major Iraqi <b>Kurdish</b> factions, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq. While both parties officially swore off independence, the Turkish government remained sufficiently concerned, and continued to keep troops in northern Iraq.|$|E
5|$|After the {{reconciliation}} with the emperor and his kinsmen, David led {{a series of}} successful raids against the Muslim emirates of Lake Van and Azerbaijan. Bagrat II of Georgia (grandfather of Bagrat, David’s adoptee), and Gagik I of Armenia allied themselves with David, who recaptured Manzikert from the Marwanid emir of Diyar Bakr about 993 and raided Akhlat, another important stronghold of this <b>Kurdish</b> dynasty, in 997. Mamlan, the Rawadid emir of Azerbaijan, was also twice defeated, the second time decisively, in 998, near Archesh.|$|E
5|$|Bajkam {{opened a}} {{campaign}} against al-Baridi in early spring 941. His lieutenants were at first defeated by the Baridis, whereupon Bajkam himself left Wasit to take the field. On his way to join his army, however, he was informed that his generals had achieved a major victory over the Baridis, and {{decided to return to}} Wasit. On 21 April 941, while travelling, he took part in a hunting excursion, during which he and his party inadvertently encountered a band of <b>Kurdish</b> brigands. During a brief skirmish, Bajkam was slain when one of the Kurds stabbed him in the back with his lance.|$|E
5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians {{as far back as}} 1920. This was made worse by the British officers of the levies who encouraged the Assyrians to think that they were first-class troops, which had the effect of increasing the natural pride of the Assyrians. This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing <b>Kurdish</b> revolts when the Iraqi Army failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the British and the Assyrians.|$|E
