5|$|In the 1930 renumbering, NY28 was {{extended}} south from Colliersville to Kingston largely {{by way of}} its current alignment along the Ulster and Delaware Turnpike. North of Cooperstown, the route was realigned to <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> modern routing between Cooperstown and Mohawk, then extended into the North Country through Wevertown to Warrensburg along its present alignment. Between Colliersville and Cooperstown, the route remained unchanged. The small portion of NY10A that did not become part of NY28 in the renumbering was incorporated into NY10.|$|E

5|$|Karas, however, {{suffered}} the worst criticisms for its story. Many reviewers {{and even the}} voice actors could not <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> dialogue and presentation. Other reviewers felt the abstract presentation forced viewers who wanted to understand the story, to pay extreme attention to the scant details presented in the show. Reelfilm and DVD Verdict were more critical, stating the viewer {{should not have to}} resort to reading summaries on the packaging to make sense of a story populated with incoherent battles and characters hard to tell apart from.|$|E
5|$|Route 7 was {{established}} in 1927 to run from Jersey City to Paterson, replacing Pre-1927 Route 11 between Belleville and Paterson. The routing was amended in 1929 to head to Route 3 in Wallington and was extended north to Route 6 (now U.S. Route 46) in East Paterson in 1949. In 1953, the route was modified to <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> current alignment.|$|E

5|$|The {{portion of}} modern NY18F south of Youngstown was {{originally}} designated {{as part of}} NY34 in 1924; however, NY34 was absorbed into NY18 {{as part of the}} 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. The change {{was part of a larger}} extension of NY18 east to Rochester. NY18 was realigned in 1949 to <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> modern alignment between Lewiston and Lake Ontario, at which time its former routing alongside the Niagara River became NY18F.|$|E

5|$|According to series artist Keiji Inafune, Dr. Wily's Revenge was {{the first}} Mega Man game to be {{outsourced}} to a developer separate from Capcom. Critical reception for the game has been favorable, and most sources have denoted it as a competent, if excessively difficult, portable version of the popular NES series. Dr. Wily's Revenge was a best-seller and spawned four sequels of its own on the Game Boy, many of which <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> trend of reusing elements from their home console counterparts. In 2011, Dr. Wily's Revenge was made available as a Virtual Console launch title on Japan's Nintendo eShop for the Nintendo 3DS. It also appeared on PAL region and North American eShops later that year.|$|E

5|$|DE 9 was {{extended}} north to US 13 Alt. (now US 13) in Wilmington by 1959, being rerouted off Smyrna-Leipsic Road to <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> current alignment to New Castle, passing through that city on 6th Street before continuing along its current alignment to Wilmington. At this point, the entire route was paved. The current Reedy Point Bridge carrying DE 9 over the Chesapeake and Delaware Canal {{was completed in}} 1968. By 1971, DE 9 {{was extended}} north to its current terminus at DE 2. DE 9 was realigned to bypass New Castle by 1984 by following Washington Street and DE 273. The intersection at the southern terminus with DE 1 was rebuilt into an interchange in 2009.|$|E
5|$|DE 9 {{was first}} {{designated}} by 1936 {{to run from}} US 113 (now DE 1) southeast of Dover north to US 13 in Smyrna, following its current alignment to Leipsic and Smyrna-Leipsic Road to Smyrna. In the 1950s, the road was extended to US 13 Alt. (now US 13) in Wilmington, {{in which it was}} rerouted at Leipsic to <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> current alignment to Wilmington. DE 9 was extended further north to DE 2 by the 1970s. The route was rerouted to bypass downtown New Castle in the 1980s. The intersection with DE 1 was reconstructed into an interchange in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In 1924, {{the segment}} of the Theodore Roosevelt International Highway within New York was {{designated}} NY3. At that time, it spanned the full eastwest length of the state, extending from the eastern bank of the Niagara River in North Tonawanda to {{the western edge of}} Lake Champlain in Plattsburgh; however, the routing through the North Country was significantly different at that time from its modern alignment. The route was moved onto its modern routing east of Watertown as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York; it was truncated to Sterling on its western end and rerouted to <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> current alignment from Sterling to Watertown roughly five years later.|$|E

5|$|In the 1930 {{renumbering}} {{of state}} highways in New York, the south {{half of the}} loop road became part of NY221, a new route extending from NY38 at Harford Mills to US11 {{in the village of}} Marathon. NY221 was extended east to its current eastern terminus in Willet by the following year. The portion of the route between the Harford loop road and Willet utilized a highway added to the state highway system sometime after 1926. NY221 was rerouted to <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> current alignment to the hamlet of Harford in the mid-1930s, and its former routing to Harford Mills was redesignated as NY200 in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|In the {{original}} {{plans for the}} U.S. Highway System, the north–south highway along the western bank of the Hudson River was designated as US9 while the highway on the eastern bank was assigned US109. The two routes were concurrent from Albany to Mechanicville, where US9 went west to follow NY6 while US109 continued north on NY30. The designations met again south of Glens Falls, where US109 ended at US9. Also in {{the original}} plans was US4, which was assigned to all of NY30's original alignment between Glens Falls and the Vermont state line. In the final system alignment approved on November 11, 1926, the routing of US9 was altered to <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> modern alignment between Albany and Glens Falls while US109 was reconfigured to use NY6B between East Greenbush and Waterford.|$|E
5|$|Marvin Bower is {{credited}} with creating McKinsey's values and principles in 1937. He established a set of rules: that consultants should put the interests of clients before McKinsey's revenues, not discuss client affairs, tell the truth {{even if it means}} challenging the client's opinion, and only perform work that is both necessary and that McKinsey can do well. Bower created the firm's principle of only working with CEOs, which was later expanded to CEOs of subsidiaries and divisions. He also created McKinsey's principle of only working with clients the firm felt would <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> advice.|$|E

5|$|NY21 {{originally}} {{extended from}} the Pennsylvania state line {{in the south to}} Lake Ontario in the north when it was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. South of Hornell, the route followed modern NY36. NY21 was rerouted to <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> current alignment south of Hornell in the 1950s and truncated on its northern end to Williamson in 1980. Other changes of local importance, mostly realignments to bypass communities along the route, have also occurred at various points in the route's history. NY21 originally had an alternate route around Canandaigua Lake; however, that highway—designated NY21A—was eliminated in the 1940s.|$|E
5|$|NY28 was {{originally}} assigned in 1924 to an alignment extending from Colliersville {{in the south}} to Utica in the north via Ilion. From Colliersville to Cooperstown, the highway followed its current routing (excluding minor realignments); north of Cooperstown, NY28 was routed along several state highways that now have other designations. The route was extended south to Kingston and north to Warrensburg as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York. At the same time, NY28 was realigned between Cooperstown and Mohawk to <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> modern routing. Other than minor realignments in Kingston, Oneonta, and Oneida County, NY28 has remained the same to this day.|$|E
5|$|NY3 {{remained}} {{on what is}} now NY31 between Middleport and Medina until the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York when it was realigned between the two villages to use what is now NY31E. U.S. Route104 was assigned to all of Ridge Road , replacing then-NY31 west of Rochester. As a result, NY31 was shifted southward onto most of NY3 from Niagara Falls to Rochester, including between Middleport and Medina. NY31 was realigned on January1, 1949, to <b>follow</b> <b>its</b> current alignment between the two villages. The former routing of NY31 was redesignated as NY31E, a northerly alternate route of NY31.|$|E
