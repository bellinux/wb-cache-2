2500|$|The {{earliest}} {{method of}} this type was the comparative method, which was developed over many years, culminating in the nineteenth century. [...] This uses a long word list and detailed study. [...] However, it {{has been criticized for}} example as being subjective, being informal, and lacking testability. The comparative method uses information from two or more languages and allows reconstruction of the ancestral language. The method of <b>Internal</b> reconstruction <b>uses</b> <b>only</b> a single language, with comparison of word variants, to perform the same function. Internal reconstruction is more resistant to interference but usually has a limited available base of utilizable words and is able to reconstruct only certain changes (those that have left traces as morphophonological variations).|$|R

50|$|These {{are some}} of the reasons many systems are often <b>used</b> for <b>internal</b> {{corporate}} <b>use</b> <b>only,</b> as {{they are less likely to}} result in lost sales. One alternative to companies lacking dedicated facilities is the rental of videoconferencing-equipped meeting rooms in cities around the world. Clients can book rooms and turn up for the meeting, with all technical aspects being prearranged and support being readily available if needed. The issue of eye-contact may be solved with advancing technology, including smartphones which have the screen and camera in essentially the same place. The ubiquity of smartphones, tablet computers, and computers with built-in audio and webcams in developed countries obviates the need to buy expensive hardware.|$|R

A study was conducted using the most common homogenization techniques, namely, grinding and sieving, riffle splitting (open- and closed-bin), and cone and quartering to homogenize four soils of differing textures to determine the effectiveness, efficiency, and extent of fine particle loss from each technique by examining particle-size distribution, loss on ignition organic matter, and pH. Five passes {{should be used to}} effectively homogenize a sample since the least replicate variability almost always occurred after the fifth pass. Riffle splitting was more efficient and had less loss of fines than cone and quartering and is therefore the recommended method for soil homogenization, The closed-bin riffle splitter had a greater apparent ability to contain the loss of fines than the open-bin riffle splitter. Grinding and sieving (random sampling) was the most efficient process yet almost consistently showed greater replicate variability than the othe...|$|R
40|$|Results {{from the}} {{application}} of three nonlinear stiffness reconstruction algorithms to two simple cylindrical geometries are presented in this paper. Finite-element simulated harmonic motion data with added noise were initially used to represent a measured surface displacement dataset for each geometry. This motion was used as input to gradient-descent, combinatorial optimization, and hybrid reconstruction algorithms that aimed to reconstruct two shape-based parameters describing the internal stiffness of the geometry. Both the combinatorial optimization and hybrid algorithms showed significant advantages in reconstructed parameter accuracy {{when compared with the}} traditional gradientdescent approach, with success metrics improving by 13 %– 28 %. Results from the hybrid algorithm applied to silicone phantom displacements demonstrated {{for the first time the}} ability of this type of algorithm to reconstruct <b>internal</b> stiffness <b>using</b> <b>only</b> experimentally measured surface motion data. Improvements in the sophistication of the hybrid approach should lead to improved accuracy in reconstructed solutions, as well as enabling reconstructions where the geometry is less straightforward...|$|R
