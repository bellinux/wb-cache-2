2500|$|Credit default swaps {{are also}} used to {{structure}} synthetic collateralized debt obligations (CDOs). Instead <b>of</b> <b>owning</b> <b>bonds</b> or loans, a synthetic CDO gets credit exposure to a portfolio of fixed income assets without owning those assets {{through the use of}} CDS. CDOs are viewed as complex and opaque financial instruments. [...] An example of a synthetic CDO is Abacus 2007-AC1, which is the subject of the civil suit for fraud brought by the SEC against Goldman Sachs in April 2010. [...] Abacus is a synthetic CDO consisting of credit default swaps referencing a variety of mortgage-backed securities.|$|R

50|$|The {{perceived}} risk <b>of</b> <b>owning</b> <b>bonds</b> {{based on}} Thailand's debt rose today, {{according to data}} compiled by Credit Derivatives Research LLC. The cost of buying credit-default swaps based on Thailand's bonds jumped as high as $75,000 from $36,000 yesterday, said Tim Backshall, a strategist at Credit Derivatives Research in Walnut Creek, California. The price was $54,000 this afternoon, he said. Credit- default swaps are financial instruments based on bonds and loans {{that are used to}} speculate on an increase or decrease in indebtedness. The contracts pay an investor $10 million {{in the event of a}} default during the next five years. Yield premiums on Thailand's 7.75 percent bond due in April 2007 compared with benchmark Treasuries rose 2 basis points to 60 basis points, the highest in a month, HSBC prices show.|$|R

50|$|It is {{important}} to note that Ireland at this time was very fragmented, with feuds and arguments happening between different clans.

50|$|The idea <b>of</b> <b>owning</b> {{government}} <b>bonds</b> initially became ideal {{to investors}} when Liberty Loan drives encouraged this possession in America during World War I. This strive for dominion persisted into the 1920s. After World War I, the United States became the world’s creditor and was depended upon by many foreign nations. “Governments {{from around the}} globe looked to Wall Street for loans”. Investors then started to depend on these loans for further investments. Chief counsel of the Senate Bank Committee, Ferdinand Pecora, disclosed that National City executives were also dependent on loans from a special bank fund as a safety net for their stock losses while American banker, Albert Wiggin, “made millions selling short his own bank shares”.|$|R
50|$|The Agriculture (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1976 {{was another}} {{far-reaching}} revamp of the law.

This Act allowed for succession of agricultural tenancies, so on a farmer's death, a relative with relevant skills or experience and no <b>holding</b> <b>of</b> his <b>own</b> could inherit the tenancy.

50|$|The {{importance}} of financial convertibility {{can be seen}} by imagining that people in a community one day find themselves with more paper currency than they wish to holdfor example, when the holiday shopping season has ended. If the dollar is physically convertible (ex. for one ounce of silver), people will return the unwanted dollars to the bank in exchange for silver, but the bank could head off this demand for silver by selling some <b>of</b> its <b>own</b> <b>bonds</b> to the public in exchange for its own paper dollars. For example, if the community has $100 of unwanted paper money, and if people intend to redeem the unwanted $100 for silver at the bank, the bank could simply sell $100 worth of bonds or other assets in exchange for $100 <b>of</b> its <b>own</b> paper dollars. This will remove the unwanted paper from circulation and head off peoples' desire to redeem the $100 for silver.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a dynamic macroeconomic {{model of a}} small open economy (SOE) under flexible exchange rates {{in which the government}} offsets its budget imbalances by sales or purchases <b>of</b> its <b>own</b> <b>bonds,</b> the dynamics arising from a stock-adjustment approach to capital movements and from the government 2 ̆ 7 s budget constraint. Stability conditions and the medium-run policy multipliers are derived. It is shown that government spending has no effect on income in the medium run but raises income in the short run. Thus, a government wishing to raise income permanently by fiscal policy must absorb an ever-increasing share of output. Monetary policy raises output in the medium run. It is shown that bond financing of government deficits is inherently destabilising in an SOE, producing at best a quasi-steady-state in which the aggregate assets stocks are constant but the composition of the bond stock is changing secularly...|$|R
