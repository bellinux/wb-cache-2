Teens and young adults may be pulled out of high school from the ages as young as 15.

25|$|An {{engineer}} who {{is often seen}} hanging out with Wally. He is referenced by name more often in older comics, {{but he is still}} seen occasionally now. He has been accepted into Dilbert's clique. He has been fired and killed numerous times (for example, being pushed {{down a flight of stairs}} and becoming possessed), so it is likely that he is rehired and brought back to life in a similar way to the other main characters who die and come back. In addition to this, he is often promoted and given benefits over the other employees. Ted has a wife and <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> referenced multiple times and seen on at least one occasion. Adams refers to him as Ted the Generic Guy because whenever he needs to fire or kill someone he uses Ted, but slowly over time Ted has become his own character.|$|E

[...] Critics have also commented on the occasional misstep in a performance; Rohan Preston noted in his review of Grimm that [...] "there are moments– just a few stand out– {{when you realize that}} these are students, after all, in a celebrated after-school program. You want them to succeed, even if they do not always." [...] Similarly, writing for BroadwayWorld, Elaina Lenertz stated, [...] "Sometimes their silks routines are a bit out of sync and sometimes the show features dance routines from younger <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> still mastering stunts.

500|$|Though {{he was a}} keen sportsman and {{a highly}} {{regarded}} member of the high school's cricket and rugby teams, he disliked his educational experience; according to Waters, [...] "I hated every second of it, apart from games. The regime at school was a very oppressive one... the same <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> susceptible to bullying by other kids are also susceptible to bullying by the teachers." [...] Whereas Waters knew Barrett and Gilmour from his childhood in Cambridge, he met future Pink Floyd founder members Nick Mason and Richard Wright in London at the Regent Street Polytechnic (later the University of Westminster) school of architecture. Waters enrolled there in 1962, {{after a series of}} aptitude tests indicated he was well-suited to that field. He had initially considered a career in mechanical engineering.|$|E
500|$|Kevin Steinberger, {{reviewer}} for Magpies, found Lat's layout made Kampung Boy an [...] "easy, inviting read." [...] He {{said that}} Lat's pen-and-ink drawings {{relied on the}} [...] "strong contrast {{between black and white}} to create space and suggest substance." [...] Lat drew the children of Kampung Boy as [...] "mostly mop-topped, toothy, bare-bottomed or sarong-draped" [...] <b>kids,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> often [...] "exaggeratedly dwarfed" [...] by items of the adult world. [...] He explained that the way the boys were drawn was partly due to the influence of comics he read in the 1950s; [...] "naughty ones with... bushy hair" [...] were prominent male protagonists in those books. [...] The adult characters are easily distinguished by their exaggerated clothing and accessories such as puffed out pants and butterfly glasses. [...] "Short and round" [...] shapes make the design of the characters distinctive. [...] These characters display exaggerated expressions, particularly when they are drawn to face the readers.|$|E
500|$|Back in Scranton, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{tries to}} protect Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) {{from a group}} of <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> {{throwing}} pine cones at her, and a young girl, [...] "Tiffany" [...] (Caitlin Williams), punches him, giving him a black eye. Andy tells his co-workers that he stepped in when a [...] "gang" [...] harassed Pam, and Pam plays along out of gratitude to Andy. Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) arranges a meeting in the conference room to discuss self-defense. Andy is then humiliated when Tiffany is brought in by her mother (Tig Notaro) and half-apologizes to him and Pam. Kelly asks Toby to demonstrate how to defend oneself when being attacked by a girl, and begins physically harassing him; Andy steps in between the two to break the fight up, resulting in his other eye being blackened. The rest of the office laughs but shuts up when Andy points out he got hit twice because he defended other people who were being attacked. The episode concludes with Andy noting that he took a bunch of pain medication, drank a bottle of wine, and took his pants off, thus greatly improving his feelings as the day ends.|$|E

[...] Zach Boren said, [...] "Everyone in the whole family is an Ohio State fan now[...] [...]No one cares about Michigan at all anymore. That {{was in the past}} and we're all looking forward to being Buckeyes and staying Buckeyes {{for the rest of our}} lives." [...] During spring practice, Boren impressed his coaches and teammates; however, he refused all interview requests. [...] During the summer, when asked about the impending Michigan – Ohio State game he said [...] "My attitude is there are 11 games before that game,[...] [...]I can't let myself get worked up thinking about that game. I don't want to take a chance of being unprepared for any of the first 11 games. The week that game gets here, it will be my primary focus."

500|$|Due to its {{tone and}} subject matter, it is {{considered}} one of the band's darker songs, alongside [...] "Adam's Song", their 2000 single revolving around suicide. Hoppus told an interviewer at the time of the album's release that [...] "There's always a song or two where we really try to really push ourselves [...] On this new record I think we've done a lot of different stuff that people wouldn't ever expect from us. [...] On the new one, it's 'Stay Together for the Kids.'" [...] DeLonge later confirmed he had received emails from fans thanking him for the song's message. [...] "With [...] "Stay Together", we get emails—just kid after kid after kid—saying, 'I know exactly what you're talking about! That song is about my life!'" [...] In 2002, divorce statistics were four times higher than their average just over thirty years prior, with over 50 percent of marriages ending in divorce. [...] "You look at statistics that 50 percent of parents get divorced, and you’re going to get a pretty large group of <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> pissed off and who don’t agree with what their parents have done," [...] said DeLonge. [...] "Stay Together" [...] was the final song completed during the recording sessions; it was created one day before the album was handed off to the mixing engineer.|$|E
500|$|Votta {{criticized the}} show for the [...] "pointless adult love triangle" [...] {{involving}} Coach Beiste, Sue, and Cooter Menkins. VanDerWerff described Jones as [...] "one of the show's greatest gifts", and lamented that they had her [...] "fighting with Sue Dynasty-style over a recruiter for Ohio State". Bell called the scene where Beiste [...] "confesses her love for Cooter" [...] a [...] "simply sweet scene that's only ruined by Sue's grumpy presence", and Sue's decision to go after Cooter a [...] "crazy plot". Votta looked at Sue's pursuit of Cooter through a different lens: [...] "in an episode that should be about <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> looking for approval and the various ways they do and don't achieve that", the show gives a [...] "completely opposite message from Sue's quest to prove her straightness", which [...] "muddles" [...] the show's messages. Chaney thought that Sue [...] "was back in fine, vindictive catchphrase-spewing form", and noted that [...] "all the election subplots were tied up remarkably quickly". This last point did {{not sit well with}} Berk, who wrote that the show resolved [...] "what was {{one of the more interesting}} subplots in one of the least interesting ways", and Canning was disappointed that the episode did not have [...] "more with Burt". As for Burt's son, Kurt, Votta wanted to [...] "leap through the television and explain to him that student council elections mean absolutely nothing" [...] to his future college prospects, and Kubicek declared himself [...] "sick" [...] of that plot thread, which he called [...] "just plain moronic".|$|E

2500|$|Kohn {{has been}} {{critical}} of several aspects of traditional schooling.

He has also denounced {{the effects of the}} test-driven [...] "accountability" [...] movement – in general, but particularly on low-income and minority students – arguing that [...] "the more poor children fill in worksheets on command (in an effort to raise their test scores), the further they fall behind affluent <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> more likely to get lessons that help them understand ideas."

The camp, which lasted for four days, involved children from Bethlehem, Ramallah, East Jerusalem, Tulkarem, Jericho, and Jenin. The Israeli children involved were mostly those who came from severe poverty and violent backgrounds. Joint-organizer Osnat Youdkevitch remarked that, [...] "Our message is that of dignity for all human beings. It's harder for adults to fully understand, since so much has already been built up around us, but kids {{have the chance to}} grow up thinking in a healthier way. If you play, eat and sweat for four days with a group of other <b>kids</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> supposed to be the 'enemy', it will stay in your heart forever." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{album was}} met with {{controversy}} upon its release when retail chain Walmart refused to carry the album unless an edited version was made.

As it was one of NIS America's first dub productions, Harlacher said took a long time to call back from the audition, and that it also took more time than other studios in producing the show.
