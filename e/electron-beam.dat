5|$|<b>Electron-beam</b> {{lithography}} (EBL) is {{a method}} of etching semiconductors at resolutions smaller than a micrometer. This technique is limited by high costs, slow performance, the need to operate the beam in the vacuum and the tendency of the electrons to scatter in solids. The last problem limits the resolution to about 10nm. For this reason, EBL is primarily used {{for the production of}} small numbers of specialized integrated circuits.|$|E
25|$|In 1984, a {{new film}} {{capacitor}} technology that makes use of vacuum-deposited <b>electron-beam</b> cross-linked acrylate materials as dielectric in film capacitors was announced as a patent in the press. But as of 2012, only one manufacturer markets a specific acrylate SMD film capacitor, as an X7R MLCC replacement.|$|E
25|$|Fabrication {{of targets}} for the ISIS neutron source at the Rutherford-Appleton Laboratory. These {{consisted}} of an assembly of depleted uranium discs clad in zircalloy. The production process involved machining the uranium discs, sealing their zircalloy containers by <b>electron-beam</b> welding, hot isostatic pressing to develop a diffusion bond between the zircalloy and the uranium and then ultrasonic testing to verify {{the integrity of the}} bond before final assembly.|$|E
25|$|<b>Electron-beam</b> {{physical}} vapor deposition, or EBPVD, {{is a form}} {{of physical}} vapor deposition in which a target anode is bombarded with an electron beam given off by a charged tungsten filament under high vacuum. The electron beam causes atoms from the target to transform into the gaseous phase. These atoms then precipitate into solid form, coating everything in the vacuum chamber (within line of sight) with a thin layer of the anode material.|$|E
25|$|Despite the {{apparent}} {{failure of the}} Cabra test, the long term legacy of the X-ray laser program is the knowledge gained while conducting the research. A parallel developmental program advanced laboratory X-ray lasers (January 14, 1985). for biological imaging {{and the creation of}} 3D holograms of living organisms. Other spin-offs include research on advanced materials like SEAgel and Aerogel, the <b>Electron-Beam</b> Ion Trap facility for physics research, and enhanced techniques for early detection of breast cancer.|$|E
25|$|Thin-film {{deposition}} is {{a process}} applied in the semiconductor industry to grow electronic materials, in the aerospace industry to form thermal and chemical barrier coatings to protect surfaces against corrosive environments, in optics to impart the desired reflective and transmissive properties to a substrate and elsewhere in industry to modify surfaces to {{have a variety of}} desired properties. The deposition process can be broadly classified into physical vapor deposition (PVD) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD). In CVD, the film growth takes place at high temperatures, leading to the formation of corrosive gaseous products, and it may leave impurities in the film. The PVD process can be carried out at lower deposition temperatures and without corrosive products, but deposition rates are typically lower. <b>Electron-beam</b> physical vapor deposition, however, yields a high deposition rate from 0.1 to 100 μm/min at relatively low substrate temperatures, with very high material utilization efficiency. The schematic of an EBPVD system is shown in Fig 1.|$|E

50|$|<b>Electron-beam</b> {{processing}} involves irradiation (treatment) {{of products}} using a high-energy <b>electron-beam</b> accelerator. <b>Electron-beam</b> accelerators utilize an on-off technology, {{with a common}} design being {{similar to that of}} a cathode ray television.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electron-beam</b> welding was {{developed}} by the German physicist Karl-Heinz Steigerwald in 1949, who was at the time working on various <b>electron-beam</b> applications. Steigerwald conceived and developed the first practical <b>electron-beam</b> welding machine, which began operation in 1958. American inventor James T. Russell has also been credited with designing and building the first <b>electron-beam</b> welder.|$|E

50|$|Despite {{the high}} {{resolution}} of <b>electron-beam</b> lithography, {{the generation of}} defects during <b>electron-beam</b> lithography is often not considered by users. Defects may be classified into two categories: data-related defects, and physical defects.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{appearance}} of the first <b>electron-beam</b> welding machines {{at the end of the}} 1950s, the application of <b>electron-beam</b> welding spread rapidly into industry and research in all highly developed countries. Up to now, uncountable numbers of various types of <b>electron-beam</b> equipment have been designed and realized. In most of them the welding takes place in a working vacuum chamber in a high or low vacuum environment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electron-beam</b> curing is {{a method}} of curing paints and inks {{without the need for}} {{traditional}} solvent. <b>Electron-beam</b> curing produces a finish similar to that of traditional solvent-evaporation processes, but achieves that finish through a polymerization process.|$|E
50|$|An <b>electron-beam</b> furnace (EB furnace) {{is a type}} of {{vacuum furnace}} {{employing}} high-energy electron beam in vacuum as the means for delivery of heat to the material being melted. It is one of the <b>electron-beam</b> technologies.|$|E
50|$|In metal-jet-anode microfocus X-ray tubes {{the solid}} metal anode is {{replaced}} with a jet of liquid metal, which acts as the <b>electron-beam</b> target. The advantage of the metal-jet anode is that the maximum <b>electron-beam</b> power density is significantly increased. Values in the range 3-6 W/µm have been reported for different anode materials (gallium and tin). In the case with a 10 µm <b>electron-beam</b> focus a metal-jet-anode microfocus X-ray source may operate at 30-60 W.|$|E

50|$|Since the {{beginning}} of <b>electron-beam</b> welding on an industrial scale {{at the end of}} the 1950s, countless <b>electron-beam</b> welders have been designed and are being used worldwide.

50|$|The major {{drawback}} of solid-anode microfocus X-ray tubes is {{the very}} low power they operate at. In order to avoid melting of the anode the <b>electron-beam</b> power density must be below a maximum value. This value is somewhere in the range 0.4-0.8 W/µm depending on the anode material. This means that a solid-anode microfocus source with a 10 µm <b>electron-beam</b> focus can operate at a power in the range 4-8 W.|$|E
50|$|The {{effectiveness}} of the electron beam depends on many factors. The most important are the physical properties of the materials to be welded, especially {{the ease with which}} they can be melted or vaporize under low-pressure conditions. <b>Electron-beam</b> welding can be so intense that loss of material due to evaporation or boiling during the process {{must be taken into account}} when welding. At lower values of surface power density (in the range of about 103 W/mm2) the loss of material by evaporation is negligible for most metals, which is favorable for welding. At higher power density, the material affected by the beam can totally evaporate in a very short time; this is no longer <b>electron-beam</b> welding; it is <b>electron-beam</b> machining.|$|E

To cover the various requirements, countless welder types have been designed, differing in construction, working space volume, workpiece manipulators and beam power. <b>Electron-beam</b> generators (electron guns) designed for welding applications can supply beams with power ranging from a few watts up to about one hundred kilowatts. [...] "Micro-welds" [...] of tiny components can be realized, as well as deep welds up to 300 mm (or even more if needed). Vacuum working chambers of various design may have a volume of only a few liters, but vacuum chambers with the volume of several hundreds cubic meters have also been built.|$|E
