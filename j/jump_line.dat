40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of the moduli spaces of instanton bundles on the Fano threefold Y_ 5 (a linear section of Gr(2, 5)). It contains new proofs of classical facts about lines, conics and cubics on Y_ 5, and about linear sections of Y_ 5. The main original results are a Grauert-Mülich theorem for the splitting type of instantons on conics, a bound to the splitting type of instantons on lines and an SL_ 2 -equivariant description of the moduli space in charge 2 and 3. Using these results we prove the existence of a unique SL_ 2 -equivariant instanton of minimal charge and we show that for all instantons of charge 2 the divisor of <b>jumping</b> <b>lines</b> is smooth. In charge 3, we provide examples of instantons with reducible divisor of <b>jumping</b> <b>lines.</b> Finally, we construct a natural compactification for the moduli space of instantons of charge 3, together with a small resolution of singularities for it.

40|$|We first define τ-functions as {{generalized}} cross-ratios of {{four points}} on a finite- or infinite-dimensional Grassmannian. We show how this definition {{can be used}} to construct a natural flat connection on a determinant line bundle associated with two equivariant holomorphic vector bundles over a twistor space, provided that the action of the symmetries on the bundles has the same normal form at the fixed points for the two bundles. The determinant line bundle has a natural meromorphic section of which the logarithmic covariant derivative is the logarithmic derivative of the τ-function. We establish a natural product formula for this τ-function; we show that it vanishes at the <b>jumping</b> <b>lines</b> of one bundle and has poles at the <b>jumping</b> <b>lines</b> of the other. We also show that this definition leads to standard expressions for the τ-functions of the KdV equation, the Ernst equation, and the isomonodromic deformation equations.
