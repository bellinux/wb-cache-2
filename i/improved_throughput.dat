40|$|Abstract — In this paper, {{we present}} new routing {{technique}} called “Demand based routing ” for mesh Networkon-Chip(NoC) which <b>improves</b> <b>throughput</b> {{in terms of}} tasks. We are proposing this because usually different nodes/tiles on NoC perform different tasks which intern may depend themselves. Various existing routing algorithms for Networkon-Chip(NoC) are <b>improving</b> <b>throughput</b> in terms of packets, global delay and energy consumption etc. In all these algorithms sender node is the initiator of packet transmission. Our proposal of “Demand based routing in NoC ” aims to <b>improve</b> <b>throughput</b> in terms of tasks, where packet transmission can be initiated by receiver node along with sender node based on situation. So in this schema receiver can request a packet(which we termed as “demand”) based on situation.
