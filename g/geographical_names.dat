5|$|According to the Government of Canada, the Government of Quebec, the Commission de toponymie du Québec, and the <b>Geographical</b> <b>Names</b> Board of Canada, {{the names}} of Canadian cities and towns have only one {{official}} form. Thus, Montréal is officially spelled with an accented é in both Canadian English and French. However, Canadian English spelling conventionally omits the accent in both Montreal and Quebec.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not known}} how many <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> were changed under the ordinance. The {{ultimate}} overarching objective behind it failed due {{to the collapse of}} the Ottoman government and trials of its leaders before Ottoman and European courts for massacres against ethnic minorities committed in 1915.|$|E

5|$|Although <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> {{have been}} {{formally}} changed in Turkey, their native names persist and continue in local dialects throughout the country. At times, Turkish politicians have {{also used the}} native names of cities during their speeches. In 2009, when addressing a crowd {{in the town of}} Güroymak, president Abdullah Gül used the native name Norşin. Also that year, when talking about his family origins, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan used the native Greek name of Potamya instead of Güneysu.|$|E
5|$|Most Armenian <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> were in {{the eastern}} provinces of the Ottoman empire. Villages, settlements, or towns that contain the suffix -kert, meaning built or built by (i.e. Manavazkert (today Malazgirt), Norakert, Dikranagert, Noyakert), -shen, meaning village (i.e. Aratashen, Pemzashen, Norashen), and -van, meaning town (i.e. Charentsavan, Nakhichevan, Tatvan), signify an Armenian name. Throughout Ottoman history, Turkish and Kurdish tribesmen have settled into Armenian villages and changed the native Armenian names (i.e. the Armenian Norashen was changed to Norşin). This was {{especially}} true after the Armenian genocide, when much of eastern Turkey was depopulated of its Armenian population.|$|E
5|$|Turkish {{nationalism}} and secularism {{were two of}} the six founding principles of the Turkish Republic. Mustafa Kemal Ataturk, the leader of {{the early decades of the}} Republic, aimed to create a nation state (Turkish: Ulus) from the Turkish remnants of the Ottoman Empire. During the first three decades of the Republic, efforts to Turkify <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> were a recurring theme. Imported maps containing references to historical regions such as Armenia, Kurdistan, or Lazistan (the official name of the province of Rize until 1921) were prohibited (as was the case with Der Grosse Weltatlas, a map published in Leipzig).|$|E
50|$|The {{geographical}} area called Kamigamo, around {{the mouth of}} the valley leading into the Kyoto Basin, became the home grounds of the Kamo (賀茂) clan in ancient times. From this, there arose the regional name Otagi Region Kamo Block (愛宕郡賀茂郷), and consequently the <b>geographical</b> <b>name</b> Kamo (賀茂) set down roots. The river name took after this <b>geographical</b> <b>name.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>geographical</b> <b>name</b> {{change from}} Cape Canaveral to Cape Kennedy {{proved to be}} unpopular, owing to the {{historical}} longevity of Cape Canaveral. In 1973, both the Air Force Base and the <b>geographical</b> Cape <b>names</b> were reverted to Canaveral.|$|R

5|$|Early Europeans {{replaced}} most of {{the original}} Māori names with their own, although they retained some Māori names {{in the north and}} central regions of the North Island. The Royal Geographical Society of London was responsible for place names until 1894 when authority was given to the Governor of New Zealand. Prime Minister Joseph Ward moved an amendment in 1894 that gave preference to Māori names for any new features and allowed misspelt names to be altered (although this did not always occur). In 1924 the Honorary Geographic Board of New Zealand was set up to advise on place names, and in 1946 the New Zealand Geographic Board (NZGB) was established and given power to change or implement Māori and English names. Anyone can propose a geographical name to the board, who consult local Māori and allow public submissions before determining if the name should be made official. Names can also be made official through an Act of Parliament and the NZGB is required to keep a public list of all the official New Zealand <b>geographical</b> <b>names.</b>|$|E
25|$|Another standard, United Nations Romanization Systems for <b>Geographical</b> <b>Names</b> (UNRSGN), was {{developed}} by the United Nations Group of Experts on <b>Geographical</b> <b>Names</b> (UNGEGN) and covers many Brahmic scripts. There are some differences between ISO 15919 and UNRSGN.|$|E
25|$|Apart {{from the}} <b>Geographical</b> <b>Names</b> Committee and the manual on <b>geographical</b> <b>names</b> {{mentioned}} above, other fields have their specialized orthographical dictionaries, such as economy, medicine, technology, chemistry, and military affairs, {{as well as}} collections of examples in periodicals, such as for zoological and botanical names.|$|E

5|$|The Kurdish <b>geographical</b> <b>name</b> {{changes were}} exempt under the Ottoman Empire {{due to the}} Islamic {{religious}} orientation of Kurds. During the Republican era and especially after the Dersim massacre, Kurdish <b>geographical</b> <b>name</b> changes became more common. During the Turkish Republican era, the words Kurdistan and Kurds were banned. The Turkish government had disguised {{the presence of the}} Kurds statistically by categorizing them as Mountain Turks. This classification was changed to the new euphemism of Eastern Turk in 1980.|$|R
