5|$|On 24 June 1882, {{the first}} issue of an {{internal}} newspaper of the factory, called, Fabrieksbode ("messenger of the factory"), was published. It was the first magazine of that kind in the world. Agneta helped her husband with other publications, such as his 1881 book, La question Ouvrière à la <b>fabrique</b> de Neerlandaise levure et d'alcool. Essai de solution pratique (The Labour Problem in the Dutch Yeast and Alcohol Factory. Attempt at a Practical Solution), and another in 1894, L'Organisation Sociale dans l'industrie (The Social System in the Industry), which was printed in two editions and translated into English and German. The full extent of Matthes' participation is not known, but she was certainly in charge of the translations.|$|E
5|$|The {{creation}} of NATO brought about some standardization of allied military terminology, procedures, and technology, which {{in many cases}} meant European countries adopting US practices. The roughly 1300Standardization Agreements (STANAG) codified many of the common practices that NATO has achieved. Hence, the 7.62×51mm NATO rifle cartridge {{was introduced in the}} 1950s as a standard firearm cartridge among many NATO countries. <b>Fabrique</b> Nationale de Herstal's FAL, which used the 7.62mm NATO cartridge, was adopted by 75 countries, including many outside of NATO. Also, aircraft marshalling signals were standardized, so that any NATO aircraft could land at any NATO base. Other standards such as the NATO phonetic alphabet have made their way beyond NATO into civilian use.|$|E
5|$|When {{the time}} came for {{developmental}} and operational testing of the SAW candidates, three 5.56mm candidate weapons were included with the 6mm candidates: the M16 HBAR, a heavy-barrel variant of the M16 designed for prolonged firing; the <b>Fabrique</b> Nationale de Herstal (FN) Minimi; and the HK 23A1. The initial round of tests ended in December 1974. In February 1976, the Minimi and Rodman XM235 SAW were selected for further development. At this time, opinions of the 6mm cartridge were beginning to sour due to the logistical implications of providing yet another ammunition type to the infantry. In June, it was requested that the SAW specifications document be revised to emphasize standard 5.56mm ammunition. In October, the requested revisions were approved, and bids were solicited for {{the conversion of the}} Rodman XM235 to 5.56mm. Production of the converted XM235 was awarded to Ford Aerospace, and its designation was changed to XM248. A new M16 HBAR variant, the XM106, was developed in 1978, and soon after, Heckler & Koch lobbied to include a 5.56mm conversion of its HK 21A1 (instead of the standard 7.62mm NATO ammunition it was built for) in future SAW testing. The latter model was designated the XM262. At this time, the Minimi received the designation XM249. Testing of the four candidates resumed in April 1979.|$|E

50|$|Landscape Gardens were {{designed}} to be allegories, taken from literature and painting, and filled with symbols and messages. They were usually either recreations of the Garden of Paradise, or of the pastoral Arcadia of Roman myths, or they {{were designed}} to offer a visual tour of the history of mankind or of all the world. The landscape was not enough - it had to have architecture. The French gardens were filled with <b>fabriques,</b> imitations of Roman temples or ruins or tombs. At Ermenonville, the gardens were ornamented with <b>fabriques</b> representing a Gothic tower, an obelisk, the Temple of Philosophy (left unfinished to represent the incompleteness of human knowledge), and a hermit's hut.|$|R

In 1912, the company was not among those Eibar manufacturers involved in legal action against <b>Fabrique</b> Nationale so it can be assumed that they had not yet begun to sell self-loading pistols based on Browning patents.|$|E
25|$|In 1905, the {{companies}} merged {{to become the}} Nestlé and Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company, retaining that name until 1947 when the name 'Nestlé Alimentana SA' was taken {{as a result of}} the acquisition of <b>Fabrique</b> de Produits Maggi SA (founded 1884) and its holding company, Alimentana SA, of Kempttal, Switzerland. Maggi was a major manufacturer of soup mixes and related foodstuffs. The company's current name was adopted in 1977. By the early 1900s, the company was operating factories in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, and Spain. The First World War created demand for dairy products in the form of government contracts, and, by the end of the war, Nestlé's production had more than doubled.|$|E
25|$|The show's {{theme song}} {{was written by}} Steve Horelick (Stephen Horelick), Dennis Neil Kleinman, and Janet Weir; Horelick also served as the series' music {{director}} and composer and received an Emmy nomination in 2007 {{for his work on}} the series. The original theme was performed by Tina <b>Fabrique</b> and featured one of the first uses of the Buchla synthesizer in a TV theme song. The original opening sequence consisted of a cartoon butterfly transforming the surroundings of young children reading books into cartoon fantasy lands, was used until 1999. Later episodes used a new opening sequence, which is a live-action sequence and features CGI in a space-themed world, with the same theme song performed first by Johnny Kemp; this intro was only used for a very short time and has since disappeared into obscurity. A third intro was used starting in early 2001, performed by R artist Chaka Khan, and featuring Burton in place of some of the CGI elements previously used. It was also used for reruns of older episodes until Labor Day of 2008 when PBS stopped airing reruns.|$|E
50|$|The gardens at Chiswick were {{originally}} {{of a standard}} Jacobean design, but from the 1720s {{they were in a}} constant state of transition. Burlington and Kent experimented with new designs, incorporating such diverse elements as mock fortifications, a Ha-ha, classical <b>fabriques,</b> statues, groves, faux Egyptian objects, bowling greens, winding walks, cascades and water features.|$|R

2500|$|Of some {{literary}} and historical interest {{because of the}} association with its builder, Jean-Jacques Lefranc, the first Marquis de Pompignan, the chateau is noteworthy today for containing in its grounds a good example, though in neglected and dilapidated condition, of a parc à <b>fabriques</b> - a landscape garden with architectural constructions and hydraulic systems (together known in English as follies).|$|R

Nantes has five cinemas, with others throughout the metropolitan area.|$|E
500|$|Before Northrop could {{complete}} any aircraft, Norway was {{invaded by}} Germany. The invasion and occupation of Norway necessitated that the armament of the N-3PB, originally {{to be installed}} in Norway, had to be changed. Initial specifications listed one Oerlikon 20 mm cannon in each wing, {{as well as two}} 7.9mm <b>Fabrique</b> Nationale machine guns each in both fuselage and rear gunner stations. Owing to the lack of availability of the originally specified armament, Norwegian-manufactured Colt heavy machine guns were substituted with four Colt MG53A [...]50 cal. machine guns in the wings and two [...]30 cal. Colt MG40s mounted in dorsal and ventral positions of the gunner's rear cockpit.|$|E
500|$|Radiohead and Godrich {{began work}} on A Moon Shaped Pool in September 2014. The band were slow to regain {{momentum}} after their hiatus and worked in [...] "fits and starts". Yorke had few demos {{and there was no}} rehearsal period; according to guitarist Ed O'Brien, [...] "We just went straight into recording ... The sound emerged as we recorded." [...] The sessions lasted until Christmas that year, and resumed for three weeks in 2015 in the La <b>Fabrique</b> studio near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France. The studio, originally a nineteenth-century mill producing art pigment, had been used by musicians including Morrissey and Nick Cave, and houses the biggest collection of vinyl records in the world.|$|E
5000|$|The main {{attraction}} of the garden was a collection of forty-eight <b>fabriques,</b> or architectural constructions, placed {{on both sides of}} the avenue de Longchamp, and connected by two tunnels. The garden also featured a winding stream, crossed by numerous bridges. The <b>fabriques</b> included kiosques, a Chinese pavilion used an icehouse, temples, a thatched cottage, and an enormous artificial rock formation created of blocks of stone carried in carts from the Forest of Fontainebleau. The rock formation was forty three metres long, eighteen metres wide, and twelve metres high. The portico of a Doric temple was placed in an alcove of the rocks, and two staircases led up to view platforms on top of the rocks. Behind the rocks was a cascade of water which flowed into the stream. Inside the artificial rock hill was a winding tunnel encrusted with minerals and crystals, and several grottoes, as well as a bathing room with a vaulted ceiling and divans.|$|R
50|$|The garden, {{completed}} in 1785, contained twenty-one <b>fabriques,</b> or architectural constructions, representing different periods {{of history and}} parts of the world; they included an artificial rock, a temple of rest, a theater, a Chinese house, a tomb, a ruined Gothic church, a ruined altar, an obelisk, a temple to the god Pan, a Siamese tent, and an ice-house {{in the form of a}} pyramid. The best-known feature was the ruined classical column, large enough to hold a residence inside.|$|R
50|$|Lord Burlington's {{garden at}} Chiswick {{was one of}} the first to include garden {{buildings}} and ancient statues which were to symbolically evoke the mood and appearance of ancient Rome. Soon after other English gardens such as Stourhead, Stowe, West Wycombe, Holkham, and Rousham were to follow suit, creating a type of garden which eventually would become known internationally as the English Landscape Garden. Lord Burlington's gardens at Chiswick had a number of these <b>fabriques</b> including the Ionic Temple, Bagnio, Pagan Temple, Rustic House, and two Deer Houses.|$|R

500|$|Radiohead {{began work}} on their ninth studio album in September 2014, joined again by Godrich. In 2015 they resumed work in the La <b>Fabrique</b> studio near Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, France. The {{sessions}} were marred {{by the death of}} Godrich's father, and Yorke's separation from his wife, Rachel Owen, who died of cancer several months after the album's completion. Recording was interrupted when the band were commissioned to write the theme for the 2015 James Bond film Spectre. They submitted [...] "Man of War", an unreleased song written in the 1990s, but this was rejected as it had not been written for the film; among other reasons, it would have been ineligible for the Academy Award for Best Original Song. Their second submission, [...] "Spectre", a [...] "brooding" [...] orchestral song, was rejected for being [...] "too dark". Instead, Radiohead released [...] "Spectre" [...] on Christmas Day 2015 on the audio streaming site SoundCloud.|$|E
500|$|After {{learning}} {{that the first}} assassination attempt had been unsuccessful, Princip thought about a position to assassinate the Archduke on his return journey, and {{decided to move to}} a position in front of a nearby food shop (Schiller's delicatessen), near the Latin Bridge. At this point the Archdukes' motorcade turned off the Appel Quay, mistakenly following the original route which would have taken them to the National Museum. Governor Potiorek, who was sharing the second vehicle with the Imperial couple, called out to the driver to reverse and take the Quay to the hospital. Driver Lojka stopped the car close to where Princip was standing, prior to backing up. The latter stepped forward and fired two shots from a distance of about one and a half metres (5 feet) using a Belgian-made 9×17mm (.380 ACP) <b>Fabrique</b> Nationale model 1910 semi-automatic pistol. Pistol serial numbers 19074, 19075, 19120 and 19126 were supplied to the assassins; Princip used #19074. According to Albertini, [...] "the first bullet wounded the Archduke in the jugular vein, the second inflicted an abdominal wound on the Duchess." [...] Princip was immediately arrested. [...] At his sentencing, Princip stated that his intention had been to kill Governor Potiorek, rather than Sophie.|$|E
