50|$|<b>Dog</b> <b>Nail</b> Clipper (Finnish: Koirankynnen leikkaaja) is a 2004 Finnish film {{directed}} by Markku Pölönen and starring Peter Franzén and Taisto Reimaluoto. The film is {{an adaptation of}} Finnish author Veikko Huovinen's 1980 novel of the same name.|$|E
50|$|Nail {{trimming}} {{is essential}} for maintaining good health. If a <b>dog's</b> <b>nails</b> are allowed to grow, they will curl over into a spiral shape; walking will become increasingly painful to the dog as they grow, putting pressure on the dogs toes (a bit like walking in shoes that are too small). Uncut nails may curl so far that they pierce the paw pad, leading to infection and debilitating pain. If one does not trim a <b>dog's</b> <b>nails</b> {{on a monthly basis}} the quick will grow along with the nail, making it nearly impossible to cut properly. Owners may choose to trim nails themselves or may opt to take their pet to a groomer or veterinarian.|$|R
50|$|The dog {{stops in}} the barn of a small ranch, where the owner and its dog find him. The man notices the <b>dog's</b> <b>nails</b> are worn down almost to his paws, so he treats them while his dog warms up the Doberman. The next morning, the dog sets off again, {{arriving}} in Los Angeles the next morning.|$|R
50|$|Reasons for victory: Apex {{was able}} to expand their {{services}} beyond washing by offering <b>dog</b> massages and <b>nail</b> clippings. As a result, they earned $307 which nearly triple of the sales revenue of Mosaic.|$|R

5000|$|The {{film was}} a success with critics, {{receiving}} mostly positive reviews and winning several major film awards. Jay Weissberg of Variety called the film [...] "Markku Polonen's most mature work to date" [...] and citing, among other things, [...] "Peter Franzen's standout performance" [...] as reason behind film's success. In a separate review in 2008, Weissberg referred to <b>Dog</b> <b>Nail</b> Clipper as [...] "emotionally satisfying but quirky". Weissberg also offered his opinion that {{the title of the}} film gives a false impression of the film's thematic subject and that it [...] "may hamper international sales". Film critic Rich Cline called the film [...] "emotionally resonant and relevant" [...] concluding that [...] "it's a simple, moving film".|$|E

40|$|The {{motivation}} for researching combined technology of transosseus osteosynthesis and intramedullary nailing was {{need to reduce}} time of treatment, and improve the rehabilitation of patients with long bone defects. Defect-pseudoarthrosis with anatomical shortening of the bone was modeled in an experiment in five adult mongrel <b>dogs.</b> Then <b>nailing,</b> Ilizarov transosseous fixation and osteotomy in proximal metadiaphysis were carried out. Bone-transport was produced according to the traditional principles of academic Ilizarov. Radiological findings showed regenerate with zonal structure, bone sections of which were presented homogeneous shadows with a periosteal osteogenesis. After 30 days of distraction regenerate lost its zonal structure, and acquired a mechanical soundness. By this time also was detected consolidation of pseudarthrosis. We have experience of treatment of six patients with posttraumatic defects of the long bones, according to the described method. At the same time carried out transosseous osteosynthesis and nailing with locking in one bone fragment. The osteotomy was performed for following distraction. After necessary length of the bone was received, the opponent locking was carried out. And external fixation was removed. This technology has allowed not using Ilizarov in fixation period of the treatment...|$|R

The earliest known case of this edit was on its first rerun in December 1989. The same version was used for later terrestrial broadcasts when the special aired on Christmas in the years 1998, 2007, 2008, 2010, and 2012. The edited version is also seen in the Blackadder Ultimate Edition DVD set and, as of 2016, is on Hulu Plus.

5000|$|The Canarian hound is {{a slender}} and lightly built but sturdy dog, of medium size, with height at the withers {{approximately}} 55 to 64 cm (21.7 to 25.2 ins) for males, females are slightly smaller. Sizes {{vary with the}} terrain on which the dog hunts. The short, dense coat should be some shade of red, white, {{or a combination of}} red and white, depending on the island and, in some cases, the specific area on some of the islands. There should be no other colour on the coat, or indeed anywhere on the body, as even the <b>dog's</b> nose, <b>nails</b> and skin should be a shade of red, and they are even known to [...] "blush" [...] when excited. The neck is long, the head is longer than it is wide, and the large ears are carried fully up. The long tail is usually seen low set but can be raised. The tail is not carried too high when moving. The dog should move in an extended and agile trot. Faults, which indicate that a particular dog should not be bred, include aspects of appearance as well as structural faults that would prevent the dog's ability to move and hunt, such as cow hocks, and crossing of the fore and hind legs at a trot.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{beautiful}} to see Jerusalem rounding {{the angle of}} a wall, and turning his head about to observe how {{the remainder of the}} procession was coming on. He was once circumnavigating a small out-house, when, catching sight of his own hinder-quarters, he flew into a terrible rage. The sight of another dog always had this effect upon Jerusalem, and more especially when, as in this case, he thought he could grasp an unfair advantage. So Jerusalem took after that retreating foe as hard as ever he could hook it. Round and round he flew, but the faster he went, the more his centrifugal force widened his circle, until he presently lost sight of his enemy altogether. Then he slowed down, determined to accomplish his end by strategy. Sneaking closely up to the wall, he moved cautiously forward, and when he had made the full circuit, he came smack up against his own tail. Making a sudden spring, which must have stretched him like a bit of India-rubber, he fastened his teeth into his ham, hanging on like a country visitor. He felt sure he had <b>nailed</b> the other <b>dog,</b> but he was equally confident the other <b>dog</b> had <b>nailed</b> him; so the problem was simplified to a mere question of endurance--and Jerusalem was an animal of pluck. The grim conflict was maintained all one day--maintained with deathless perseverance, until Dad Petto discovered the belligerent and uncoupled him. Then Jerusalem looked up at his master with a shake of the head, as much as to say: [...] "It's a precious opportune arrival for the other pup; but who took him off me?" ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{uses the}} {{distribution}} and interpretation of antonymous adjectives in comparative constructions to argue that an empirically and explanatorily adequate semantics for gradable adjectives must introduce abstract representations, or ‘degrees’, into the ontology. I begin with {{an overview of the}} basic assumptions of analyses that do not make reference to scales and degrees. I then turn to a discussion of the empirical data, and I demonstrate that such approaches do not support a principled explanation of the facts, but a degree-based account does. 1. Gradable Adjectives and the Problem of Vagueness A fundamental problem for the semantic analysis of gradable adjectives like tall, long, and expensive {{is that many of the}} sentences in which they occur are vague. (1), for example, could be true in one context and false in another. (1) The Mars Pathfinder mission was expensive. In a context in which the discussion includes all objects that have some cost value associated with them, (1) would most likely be judged true, since the cost of sending a spacecraft to Mars is far greater than the cost of most things (e. g., <b>nails,</b> <b>dog</b> food, a used Volvo, etc.). In a context in which only missions involving interplanetary exploration are salient, however, then (1) would probably be judged false, since a unique characteristic of the Mars Pathfinder mission was its low cost compared to other projects involving the exploration of outer space (se...|$|R
50|$|On {{the morning}} of Saturday, February 17, 2007, eight {{experienced}} climbers from the Portland area ascended in sunny, mild weather. Observing worse weather mid-afternoon, they camped at the 9300 ft level of Illumination Saddle overnight. Sunday morning, they abandoned a summit attempt and descended in freezing rain and snow, visibility less than 30 ft, and winds at 40 to 70 mph (64 to 120 km/h). At about noon, disoriented, three of the climbers and a black lab stepped off a cliff (at the 8300 ft level at the east edge of Palmer Glacier) while tethered together and tumbled down several hundred feet of steep slope into White River Canyon. One of the remaining five climbers was lowered by rope {{to search for the}} fallen group, but returned without seeing them. They called for help by cell phone, and were advised of even worse weather advancing, so dug in expecting another night. However, rescuers arrived and evacuated them Sunday evening. The three fallen climbers were unable to dig into solid ice to build a snow cave, so they improvised a shelter and were in hourly cell phone contact with rescuers. They had a Mountain Locator Unit, sleeping bags, GPS, and a tarp. The dog, Velvet, helped keep them warm. Rescuers arrived Monday about 10:45 am. One was hospitalized for a head injury, the others were treated for minor injuries and released. The <b>dog</b> had broken <b>nails</b> and a cut on one of her back legs from cold exposure.|$|R

6000|$|... ‘Oh—ah! Well, here I found poor Fanny, quite disconsolate and uncomfortable. The old boy {{had been}} very cross all day, which made her feel still more lonely; and she was quite out of spirits. So, I put a good face on the matter, and laughed it off, and said we should enjoy the pleasures of a matrimonial life more by contrast; and, at length, poor Fanny brightened up a little. I stopped there, till about eleven o’clock, and, just as I was taking my leave for the fourteenth time, the girl came running down the stairs, without her shoes, in a great fright, {{to tell us that}} the old villain—Heaven forgive me for calling him so, for he is dead and gone now!—prompted I suppose by the prince of darkness, was coming down, to draw his own beer for supper—a thing he had not done before, for six months, to my certain knowledge; for the cask stood in that very back kitchen. If he {{discovered}} me there, explanation would have been out of the question; for he was so outrageously violent, when at all excited, that he never would have listened to me. There was only one thing to be done. The chimney was a very wide one; it had been originally built for an oven; went up perpendicularly for a few feet, and then shot backward and formed a sort of small cavern. My hopes and fortune—the means of our joint existence almost—were at stake. I scrambled in like a squirrel; coiled myself up in this recess; and, as Fanny and the girl replaced the deal chimney-board, I could see the light of the candle which my unconscious father-in-law carried in his hand. I heard him draw the beer; and I never heard beer run so slowly. He was just leaving the kitchen, and I was preparing to descend, when down came the infernal chimney-board with a tremendous crash. He stopped and put down the candle and the jug of beer on the dresser; he was a nervous old fellow, and any unexpected noise annoyed him. He coolly observed that the fire-place was never used, and sending the frightened servant into the next kitchen for a hammer and nails, actually nailed up the board, and locked the door on the outside. So, there was I, on my wedding-night, in the light kerseymere trousers, fancy waistcoat, and blue coat, that I had been married in in the morning, in a back-kitchen chimney, the bottom of which was nailed up, and the top of which had been formerly raised some fifteen feet, to prevent the smoke from annoying the neighbours. And there,’ added Mr. Gabriel Parsons, as he passed the bottle, ‘there I remained till half-past seven the next morning, when the housemaid’s sweetheart, who was a carpenter, unshelled me. The old <b>dog</b> had <b>nailed</b> me up so securely, that, to this very hour, I firmly believe that no one but a carpenter could ever have got me out.’ ...|$|R
