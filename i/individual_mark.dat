40|$|International audienceThe {{relationships}} between {{movements of the}} meadow brown butterfly (Maniola jurtina) and landscape features were examined at different scales in three hedgerow network landscapes of western France. Of the 4174 and 1474 <b>individuals</b> <b>marked</b> in the three landscapes in 1998 and 1999 respectively, a total of 1057 and 285 were recaptured at least once. Partial least squares (PLS) regression was used to model the number of butterflies moving between herbaceous patches within the landscape. The model predictors were related to (i) the distance separating the patches, (ii) {{the characteristics of the}} landscape between the patches and (iii) the characteristics of the departure and arrival patches, including the number of <b>individuals</b> <b>marked</b> in each patch. Site effects were tested by fitting separate models on each site and scale effects were tested by varying the extent of the windows in which landscape variables were extracted. The fits yielded models with R 2 values ranging from 0. 22 to 0. 64. Whatever the site, the distance between both patches and the number of <b>individuals</b> <b>marked</b> in the departure patch, exhibited significant and consistent effects on butterfly movements. Mean field size and direction of green network elements (hedges, field margins) were also relevant in some cases...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND : Team-based {{learning}} {{is an integral}} part of engineering education today. Development of team skills is now a part of the curriculum at universities as employers demand these skills on graduates. Higher education institutions enforce academic staff to teach, practise and assess team skills, and at the same time, they ask academic staff to supply <b>individual</b> <b>marks</b> and/or grades. Allocating <b>individual</b> <b>marks</b> from a team mark is a very complex and sensitive task that may adversely affect both individual and team performance. A number of both qualitative and quantitative methods are available to address this issue. Quantitative mathematical methods are favoured over qualitative subjective methods as they are more straightforward to explain to the students and they may help minimise conflicts between assessors and students. PURPOSE : This study presents a review of commonly used mathematical equations to allocate <b>individual</b> <b>marks</b> from a team mark. Quantitative analytical equations are favoured over qualitative subjective methods because they are more straightforward to explain to the students and if explained to the students in advance, they may help minimise conflicts between assessors and students. Some of these analytical equations focus primarily on the assessment of the quality of teamwork product (product assessment) while the others put greater emphasis on the assessment of teamwork performance (process assessment). The remaining equations try to strike a balance between product assessment and process assessment. The primary purpose of this study is to discuss the qualitative aspects of quantitative equations. DESIGN/METHOD : This study simulates a set of scenarios of team <b>marks</b> and <b>individual</b> contributions that collectively cover all possible teamwork assessment environments. The available analytical equations are then applied to each case to examine their relative merits with respect to a set of evaluation criteria with exhaustive graphical plots. RESULTS : Although each analytical equations discussed and analysed in this study has its own merits for a particular application scenario, the recent methods such as knee formula in SPARKPLUS and cap formula, are relatively better in terms of a number of evaluation criteria such as fairness, teamwork attitude, balance between process and product assessments etc. In addition to having all favourable properties of knee formula, cap formula explicitly considers the quality of teamwork (i. e., team <b>mark)</b> while allocating <b>individual</b> <b>marks.</b> Cap formula may, however, be difficult to explain to the students due to relatively complex mathematical equations involved. CONCLUSIONS : Not all existing analytical equations that allocate <b>individual</b> <b>marks</b> from a team mark have similar characteristics. Recent methods, knee formula and cap formula, are advantageous in terms of a number of evaluation criteria and are recommended to apply in practice. However, it is important to examine these equations with respect to enhancing students’ learning achievements rather than the students and academic staff’s preferences...|$|R

The methodology can be further deployed as a standardized method to quantify co-authors’ contributions in multi-author papers, and subsequently become a supplement evaluation tool for the university's decision maker to grade or reward the authors...|$|E
40|$|The main aim of {{this study}} was to test and ascertain, objectively, theexistence/occurrence of the {{phenomenon}} of Synergy in teams. To do this, the results of anonline course in Umea University, where students are invariably required to do a bunch ofindividual as well as team assignments, were analysed: the idea was to compare the marksobtained by the students in their team assignments with their marks in their individualassignments and to check if there was a reasonably good number of instances where the teammark was higher than the highest <b>individual</b> <b>mark</b> in that particular team. The basicassumption was that in case the team mark of a team was higher than the highest individualmark in that team, then, it can be presumed that synergy has taken place in that team for thatparticular team assignment. And, given a reasonably large sample of teams, it would beinstructive to see what percentage of groups/teams actually show synergy. In case a goodnumber of teams show such results then we could conclude that there was objective evidencein favour of the synergy. In case our analysis brought to fore such results then it would benatural to take the study one step ahead and test a broad causal relationship of synergy withthe complexity/difficulty of task at hand. After analysing the results of about 387 students, who worked in about 104 teams, itwas found that about 69. 23 % teams scored higher than the highest scoring individual; 93. 26 %teams faired better than the average score of team members; and, 98. 07 % teams can be said tohave performed better if compared to the lowest individual score. Further, one level below, when team-score and individual-score were compared acrossdifferent team and individual tasks (Case Studies), it still came to fore that teams hadoutperformed the individuals. And, when a single student’s marks in his team assignmentswere compared with his marks in his individual assignments, in five out of six comparisons itwas found that the team mark was convincingly higher than the <b>individual</b> <b>mark.</b> All these results strongly indicated the existence/occurrence of synergy in teams. In addition to this, an experiment on two teams of students was also performed toshow that synergy was more likely to happen if the task at hand was complex/ difficult. Theresults of this experiment seemed to corroborate the contention of the researchers. Keywords: Project Management, Team, Team Work, Individual work, Synerg...|$|E
40|$|With 2 figures) Size distribution, {{sex ratio}} {{and use of}} burrows of the {{burrowing}} toad Rhinella fernandezae were studied in Buenos Aires province, Argentina. Two sites separated by approximately 300 m were studied: one was a road next to a swamp, {{and the other a}} garden of a country house located further from the swamp. We identified toad burrows, and individuals were sexed, measured and given an <b>individual</b> <b>mark.</b> Burrows were examined in subsequent months after the first sam-pling to assess the presence of toads. We found significant differences in the size distribution between areas, being the proportion of juveniles greater at the site next to the swamp where the reproduction of the species was observed. This result may suggest that the site located near to the swamp functions as a source habitat of individuals that migrate to the other site, where recruitment would be very scarce. Sex proportion of adults did not differ from 1 : 1 in neither the total population nor in each site, suggesting that there was not differential mortality by sex. Some toads changed burrows throughout the study period, but there were not differences in the frequency of change between adults and juveniles...|$|E

50|$|Mark and {{recapture}} is {{a method}} commonly used in ecology to estimate an animal population's size. A {{portion of the population}} is captured, marked, and released. Later, another portion is captured and the number of <b>marked</b> <b>individuals</b> within the sample is counted. Since the number of <b>marked</b> <b>individuals</b> within the second sample should be proportional to the number of <b>marked</b> <b>individuals</b> in the whole population, an estimate of the total population size can be obtained by dividing the number of <b>marked</b> <b>individuals</b> by the proportion of <b>marked</b> <b>individuals</b> in the second sample. The method is most useful when it is not practical to count all the individuals in the population. Other names for this method, or closely related methods, include capture-recapture, capture-mark-recapture, mark-recapture, sight-resight, mark-release-recapture, multiple systems estimation, band recovery, the Petersen method, and the Lincoln method.|$|R
