25|$|Mathieu {{began her}} career by {{participating}} in an annual singing contest in Avignon called On Chante dans mon Quartier (We sing in my neighborhood). Photos depict the affair as rather drab with a cheap curtain and one projector light. The stage was only twenty feet square, and the singer having to share that with a large piano and musicians. One cannot <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> the large, boisterous, and mostly young audience. The judges {{sat at a table}} in front of and below the elevated stage. Anyone who signed the contract in the weeks before the show was allowed to sing. Talent scouts made this a worthwhile event for singers within hundreds of kilometers to participate in.|$|E
500|$|As Vermeer {{secretly}} {{works on}} the eponymous painting, Catharina cannot <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> something is amiss and her growing jealousy of Griet becomes apparent. As Griet deals with her growing fascination with Vermeer and his talent, she has to fend off Van Ruijven's attempt to rape her. Later, when Catharina {{is out for the}} day, her mother hands Griet [...] her daughter's pearl earrings, and asks Vermeer [...] to finish the painting. [...] At the final painting session Vermeer pierces Griet's left earlobe so she can wear one of the earrings for the portrait. [...] Griet then runs to Pieter to be consoled. [...] They caress and make love in a barn, where Pieter proposes marriage, but unexpectedly leaves, whereas she then returns the earrings to Catharina's mother.|$|E
500|$|Peter Bradshaw of The Guardian {{gave the}} film a {{negative}} review, likening it to [...] "being mugged {{by a professional}} whose skills in mixed martial arts you can't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> and appreciate, even as you are savagely beaten, then dragged upright, bruised and bleeding, and forced to watch as your assailant gives fully 45% of your money to charity." [...] Christy Lemire writing for Roger Ebert's website gave it two stars out of four and criticized the film for being [...] "emotionally inert, despite its many moments that are meant to put a lump in our throats." [...] Lemire criticized Elgort's performance and praised Woodley's [...] "abiding, disarming naturalism." [...] Robbie Collin writing for The Daily Telegraph said: [...] "Gus {{is something of a}} manic pixie dreamboat: the lesser-spotted male version of the kooky, adoring girlfriend-type sometimes played by Kirsten Dunst, Natalie Portman, and Zooey Deschanel." [...] David Edelstein of NPR said: I know people who cried at the trailer of the romantic teen cancer movie The Fault in Our Starsat the movie they'll need a life preserver to keep from drowning in a flood of tears. Me, I didn't cry, though at times my tear ducts tingled; I was on the verge. The film is a little slick for my taste, too engineered. But it's gently directed by Josh Boone and beautifully acted. Whatever the faults, it's not in the stars. Shalini Langer of The Indian Express gave the film {{two and a half stars}} and said: [...] "The film is faithful to a fault from the dialogues to the clothes, the setting and the food, even while skipping over some of the unpleasant details." [...] Dana Stevens writing for Slate Magazine said: [...] "What in the name of God is wrong with me that I didn't cry onceI, who just the day before wept through the entirety of my child's thoroughly upbeat school play." ...|$|E

While going through the whole [...] "Somebody's been eating my porridge" [...] and [...] "Somebody's been sleeping in my bed" [...] bit, Sylvester Jr. is relieved that his porridge is all gone and that the intruder in his bed is a mouse. When he says this, Goldimouse wakes up, freaks out {{at the sight of}} Sylvester Jr., and turns to Sylvester for <b>help,</b> <b>but</b> <b>notices</b> he too is a cat and escapes out the tiny door.|$|R
40|$|In {{this chapter}} I discuss the {{theoretical}} {{issues and the}} aesthetic consequences of dubbing, both in general – when the translation is faithful and the dubbing {{is a good one}} – and in peculiarly bad cases – when either the translation or the dubbing, or both, are inaccurate. Dubbing is widely used in European countries such as Germany, France, the ex-Soviet countries and Italy. Being a film scholar with a specialization in Hollywood cinema, I am used to watching Hollywood films in their original versions. Being a native Italian speaker, I cannot <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>noticing</b> the differences between the original films and the Italian dubbed versions. Inaccurate translations and bad dubbing can severely harm the film's original meaning on the one hand, and lead to aesthetics changes on the other– e. g., an actor's persona or a character's characterization can be modified if dubbed with a voice that is radically different from the original. The case of Marilyn Monroe is exemplary: the Italian dubbing was designed to make her sound definitely more stupid than in the original version – by changing her dialogue, and by choosing a more “goose-like” voice timbre and tone...|$|R
2500|$|Richthofen {{took the}} {{flamboyant}} step of having his Albatros painted red {{when he became}} a squadron commander. His autobiography states, [...] "For whatever reasons, one fine day I came upon the idea of having my crate painted glaring red. The result was that absolutely everyone could not <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> my red bird. In fact, my opponents also seemed to be not entirely unaware [...] ". Thereafter he usually flew in red-painted aircraft, although not all of them were entirely red, nor was the [...] "red" [...] necessarily the brilliant scarlet beloved of model- and replica-builders.|$|E

2500|$|... 1975–1976 Gran Torinos {{were used}} in the popular Spelling-Goldberg Productions TV series Starsky and Hutch. The {{producers}} needed a flashy specialty car for the main characters to drive. Since Ford was the lease supplier for on-screen cars through their Studio-TV Car Loan Program, eventually it was decided by the producers that a bright red 1975 Gran Torino two-door would be the vehicle of choice for the pilot episode. To make the Torino less mundane, a large white vector stripe was added. Aluminum 5-slot mag wheels and larger rear tires replaced the stock wheels and tires, and air shocks were added to give the car an aggressive rake. The television show became quite popular with the public, and much of that popularity was centered on the star Torino. Ford couldn't <b>help</b> <b>but</b> take <b>notice</b> to the public's interest in the [...] "Starsky and Hutch" [...] Torino, and decided to introduce a replica version of the TV car.|$|R
50|$|The {{heads of}} the Lupertazzi and DiMeo {{families}} meet to discuss the removal of asbestos from a building project. Tony rejects Phil's demand of a 25% cut of {{the money from the}} illegal dumping. While driving Tony home, Christopher is agitated and repeatedly changes the radio station, finally settling for a CD soundtrack of The Departed. As the road curves and Chris ups the stereo volume, he swerves into the opposite lane and swerves to avoid a car, causing his Cadillac Escalade EXT to go off the road and rollover. Tony suffers minor injuries, but Chris is seriously injured and has difficulty breathing. He tells Tony he will not pass the drug test. Tony begins to call for <b>help,</b> <b>but</b> after <b>noticing</b> that a tree branch has impaled Christopher's vehicle directly where his daughter would have been seated had she been in it, Tony suffocates him before calling an ambulance. At the hospital, he leads the staff and his family to believe that Chris died from the crash.|$|R
50|$|Time {{plays an}} {{integral}} {{role in the}} theme of faith and doubt in Mrs. Dalloway. The overwhelming presence of the passing {{of time and the}} impending fate of death for each of the characters is felt throughout the novel. As Big Ben arches over the city of London and rings for each half-hour, characters can’t <b>help</b> <b>but</b> stop and <b>notice</b> the loss of life to time in regular intervals throughout the development of the story. Experiencing the vicious war, the notion of death constantly floats in Septimus’ mind as he continues to see his friend Evans talking of such things. A constant stream of consciousness from the characters, especially Clarissa, can serve as a distraction from this passing of time and ultimate march towards death but each character has a constant reminder of the inevitability of these facts. However evident time and death may be throughout the novel, only a day passes {{over the course of the}} entire story, not nearly enough to be worried about death that much. Each individual moment in a character’s life then is assumed to be as important as heroic journeys and other epics which also push the boundaries of death.|$|R

40|$|To {{celebrate}} Alexander Scriabin’s (1872 - 1915) anniversary year, his Mystic Chord {{was used}} as the primary pitch material within this work. A Mystic Complement completed the total chromatic and provided secondary pitch material used for contrast and balance. This duo for two pianos carries the listener through two movements of succinct and focused musical form. Both pianos begin playing the primary atonal material: the Mystic Chord and then the 2 nd piano plays the Mystic Complement, combining to create a 12 -tone soundworld, but effectively playing in two different atonalities. Before the movement ends with a final statement of the opening theme, both pianos play the six pitches of the Mystic Complement at figure N in a relaxed and melodic passage with a modal ‘quasi-blues’ feel to the atonal pitch collection. The first thematic statement holds a reference to an invisible G (Jazz melodic minor) and the final statement is in an atonal A. The melodic material at figure N outlines a clear reference to an Ab ‘atonal modality’, and so the form passes through two semi-tone modulations before resolving a whole-tone above where it started. Whilst one could not <b>help</b> <b>but</b> consciously <b>notice</b> references to Lutosławski’s semi-tonal formal modulations, the form (and eventual pitch-scheme) was a natural consequence of working with the Mystic Chord. Rotating through predetermined elements of the pitch matrix, the lyrical and expressive final movement starts in Chord material and ends in the Complement after passing through the total chromatic twice along the way. The form is fluid and linear with energetic crescendos and similar semi-tone modulations as the first movement. The pitch organisation produced a clear contrast between flats and naturals in the primary and secondary material and provided the catalyst for the opening (and closing) piano clusters, where syncopated rhythms separate pentachords (pentaclusters), playing all five flat notes from diatonic clusters playing all seven natural notes. There was also a notable conflict between E flat and E natural in the primary and secondary (Chord and Complement) material. This pair of notes (and similar semi-tone conflict and resolution) can be heard at pivotal formal landmarks within the movement and the pitch-scheme, it is also used to flavour the melodic contour of the writing...|$|R

60|$|She {{had allowed}} herself to be led away by the eagerness of her desire {{to know what was}} happening. Shrewd enough where her own wishes and plans were concerned, she could not <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> the air of contentment, even of triumph, which the Cardinal had worn {{throughout}} the evening. He certainly did not look like a man about to be sent back discomfited, to an irate master, there to explain that he had failed in the task allotted to him.|$|E
60|$|Thus two agonizing days went by; agonizing {{they were}} to everybody. Madame la Marquise {{became more and more}} agitated, more and more hysterical as time went on, and the {{servants}} could not <b>help</b> <b>but</b> <b>notice</b> this, even though she made light of the whole affair, and desperate efforts to control herself. The heads of her household, the major-domo, the confidential maid, the chef de cuisine, did venture to drop a hint or two as to the possibility of an accident or of foul play, and the desirability of consulting the police; but Madame would not hear a word of it; she became very angry at the suggestion, and declared that she was perfectly well aware of M. le Marquis's whereabouts, that he was well and would return home almost immediately.|$|E

They heard him coming and not knowing at first who it was they at once started for the water. Peter never will forget the funny way in which they waddled. He never had seen anybody quite so awkward. But when they reached the water he forgot to laugh. He simply stared open-mouthed in astonishment. You see there they were as graceful as they had been awkward on land. Afterward, when Peter had become acquainted with them and they were the best of friends, he ventured to speak of their queer feet.|$|E
