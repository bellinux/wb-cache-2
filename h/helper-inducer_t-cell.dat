40|$|Neurosarcoidosis {{carries a}} {{mortality}} of 10 %, over {{twice that of}} sarcoidosis overall, {{although it has been}} rarely reported as a cause of sudden death. The current evidence suggests that sarcoidosis results from an enhanced immune reaction to a variety of antigens, non-self or self which causes CD 4 (<b>helper–inducer)</b> <b>T-cell</b> accumulation with a ratio of helper–inducer T cells to suppressor-cytotoxic T cells usually high in affected organs, activation and release of inflammatory cytokines, and formation of granulomatous lesions. Numerous cytokines and other mediators are produced by both activated macrophages and T lymphocytes bearing the CD 4 -helper phenotype during the granuloma responses. A number of data suggest that interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) and cytokines such as TNF-α, IL- 2, and IL- 18 {{play a critical role in}} the formation of granulomas. In this article, we describe the clinical and pathological characteristics of a patient who suddenly died due to acute respiratory failure. Neurosarcoidosis with massive and extensive involvement of the brainstem was established as the cause of death. Western blot analysis in the patient demonstrated the TNF-α presence as a 51 -kDa protein in the brain tissue. The immunohistochemical analysis showed a poor positiveness for CD 4 in all samples around the granulomas, as well as moderate positiveness for CD 8, CD 15, and CD 20; CD 45 and CD 68 showed a strong positiveness in all the brain samples. Histological findings, immunohistochemical analysis, and proteomic studies addressed the diagnosis of neurosarcoidosis with involvement of the nucleus of the solitary tract in the brainstem and central hypoventilation as the cause of death...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} test the {{hypothesis}} that the immune system plays a role in the pathogenesis of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), the cellular composition of the spinal cord inflammatory infiltrate was analysed in eight cases of sporadic ALS by a panel of monoclonal antibodies. The majority of the many diffusely scattered lymphocytes seen in the anterior and lateral corticospinal tracts and anterior horns belonged to the suppressor/cytotoxicity T-cell subset and were admixed with variable numbers of macrophages. <b>Helper-inducer</b> <b>T-cells</b> were rare and B-cells were conspicuously absent. Compared to controls, ALS specimens exhibited an increase in major histocompatibility complex (MHC) products or human leucocyte antigens (HLA) in the corticospinal tracts and anterior horns. HLA-ABC antigens were expressed in the honeycomb pattern of the glial matrix of the spinal cord, and HLA-DR antigens were strongly expressed by large dendritic cells. In addition, macrophages and endothelial cells were labelled by HLA-DR. These findings suggest that an autoimmune process or infectious agent {{may play a role in}} AL...|$|R
40|$|Individuals with HIV/AIDS require {{therapy with}} biopsikososiospiritual approach, meaning that {{patients}} {{must be viewed}} in terms of organobiologik, psychological / psychiatric, psycho-social and spiritual aspects / spirituality. Patients are not viewed as individuals alone, but one member of a family, community and social environment, {{as well as being}} in a state of helplessness which requires the fulfillment of spiritual needs / spirituality or religion. Fulfillment of spiritual needs were all-important contribution in the course of life for people with HIV/AIDS. Research results of Woods (1999) from University of Miami, show that patients actively running religious worship has the percentage of CD 4 + and CD 4 + (<b>helper-inducer</b> <b>T-cells)</b> increases, which means that the immune system running well. The purposes of this research are 1). To describe the spiritual response of people with HIV AIDS in the VCT clinic Panti Wiloso Citarum Semarang; 2). To describe the implementation of HIV counseling for people with AIDS at the VCT clinic Panti Wiloso Citarum Semarang; 3) To describe the spiritual dimension in the practice of counseling for people with HIV AIDS in the VCT clinic Panti Wiloso Citarum Semarang. Required data in the study will be obtained from the primary data sources include documents Panti Wiloso VCT, VCT counselors and clients Wiloso Panti. While the secondary data obtained from the literature related to research themes. Data collection techniques used were the documentation and interviews. While the analysis of research data using the model of Miles and Huberman analysis is divided into three phases: data reduction, data display and Conclusion drawing or verification. The results of this study were: 1). Spiritual response to AIDS in HIV VCT clinic Wiloso Citarum Semarang Panti showed mixed responses, both positive and negative views of the following seven aspects of faith and meaning in life, or supervising authority, experience and emotion, friendship and community, ritual and worship, encouragement and growth, as well as call and consequences; 2). Implementation of HIV counseling for people with AIDS in the VCT clinic Panti Wiloso Citarum Semarang {{can be seen from the}} following aspects: a). Counselors made up of four people who have been trained counselors HIV / AIDS according to WHO standards are implemented by the Directorate General of Communicable Disease and Environmental Health; b). Clients who have dealt with 69 people. Most of the sex offender, and the other is commercial sek workers, transvestites, homosexuality, IUD, housewives and children, c). This type of counseling services, among others, pre-post-tests, family counseling, ongoing counseling, adherence counseling and counseling to face death; d). There are two models of VCT services are integrated with health care services and the range of community services. While the counseling methods used are either direct methods such as individual counseling or a group such as group counseling and peer groups; e). Evaluation system used to use inter-counselor supervision and external evaluation by direct interview techniques; 3). Spiritual dimension in the practice of counseling for people with HIV / AIDS is a vertical emphasis on the human relationship with God and horizontal aspects of the human relationship with each other...|$|R
