5|$|Although she {{appeared}} {{on television and}} in dramatic roles, her career petered out in the late 1950s, as complications from her diabetes made it increasingly difficult <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> work. Her final stage appearance was in a 1958 off-Broadway production of Jean Cocteau's 1934 play, The Infernal Machine, appearing alongside John Kerr and June Havoc.|$|E
5|$|As her fame grew, Coffin {{gained the}} {{opportunity}} to put her design principles into practice on a larger scale. Her practice had grown large enough <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> need an assistant by 1911, and by 1918 she had moved her office to larger premises at 830 Lexington Avenue. She also took on James Scheiner, an architect, as an associate. He became {{a key part of}} Coffin's practice, working on large-scale tasks such as overseeing work on the ground. This in turn opened up new opportunities <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> take on new, larger commissions. Coffin insisted on being paid the same fees as a male architect and to be treated equally in contracts; this was a novelty in itself, at a time when women were usually paid less than men. She also liked to employ women to work with her on commissions, giving them the chance to undertake apprenticeships that male prejudice had denied her when she had first started on her career.|$|E

After futile attempts to convince Shiva to grant his consent <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> attend, the enraged Sati assumes a fierce form, transforming into the Mahavidyas, who surround Shiva from the ten cardinal directions. As per the Shakta Maha-bhagavata Purana, Chhinnamasta stands {{to the right of}} Shiva, interpreted as the east or the west; the Brihaddharma Purana describes her as appearing to the rear of Shiva in the west.|$|E

In 1783, she had become a lady's companion in Newport, Shropshire. It was there that she was approached by Day's friend, the man who helped choose her at the foundling hospital, John Bicknell.

He had not paid much attention to Sabrina since selecting her with Day, but proposed marriage immediately.|$|E

Her influence extended down into Devon and Cornwall, and north through Herefordshire, but her authority in these areas remained limited.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Dalton felt {{jealous of}} boys {{for the freedom}} they enjoyed. They could travel alone without {{worrying}} about their reputation and were often bribed to attend school, while girls were, in her opinion, educated reluctantly. One of her teachers {{thought it would be}} wasteful <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> study algebra, as she already had sufficient education for a housewife. As a young woman, she felt that women lived on a higher moral level than men. She saw polygamy as a way to allow more women to marry the few good men, arguing that it gave more women the opportunity to marry. She also considered it ironic that prostitution was tolerated but polygamy was considered depraved.|$|E
5|$|As we {{understand}} the situation here, the Australian Constitution firmly places the prerogative powers of the Crown {{in the hands of}} the Governor-General as the representative of the Queen of Australia. The only person competent to commission an Australian Prime Minister is the Governor-General, and The Queen has no part in the decisions which the Governor-General must take in accordance with the Constitution. Her Majesty, as Queen of Australia, is watching events in Canberra with close interest and attention, but it would not be proper <b>for</b> <b>her</b> <b>to</b> intervene in person in matters which are so clearly placed within the jurisdiction of the Governor-General by the Constitution Act.|$|E
