25|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>bead</b> {{sterilizers}} work by heating {{glass beads}} to 250°C. Instruments are then quickly doused in these glass beads, which heat the object while physically scraping contaminants off their surface. <b>Glass</b> <b>bead</b> sterilizers {{were once a}} common sterilization method employed in dental offices as well as biological laboratories, but are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) {{to be used as}} a sterilizers since 1997.

It was {{seen that the}} presence of <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> did not inhibit the polymerization of St, and FT-IR spectra confirmed that the polystyrene (PS) molecules were grafted on the surfaces of <b>glass</b> <b>beads.</b> When the modified <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> were filled in a poly(phenylene oxide) (PPO) matrix, the PS segments on the surfaces of <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> clearly improved compatibility and enhanced interfacial adhesion between the PPO matrix and <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> which was responsible for the slightly increased glass transition temperature of the PPO component. Surface modifications, especially by in situ copolymerization of VTES and St, increased significantly notch impact strengths and marginal stiffness and tensile strengths of PPO/glass bead composites.

The three fairies, Flora, Fauna and Merryweather, provide gowns and outfits for the trio, but Kilala's dress turns into that of a maid and is forced {{to work at the}} castle's party for Princess Aurora's 17th birthday. Kilala helps Prince Phillip's little cousin find a <b>glass</b> <b>bead.</b> When they do find it, the little princess gives it to her as a token for her help. Sylphy laughs at Kilala for being naïve and unsuitable to be a real princess. Princess Aurora finds Kilala on the balcony and tells her to keep on believing in herself and her love for Rei. Maleficent appears (disguise as Lady Malecent) and attempts to curse Aurora with magic rose thorns. Kilala shields the princess and falls under the spell. Rei breaks Maleficent's magic with true love's kiss. Right after Maleficent is defeated, the <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> turns into a rose quartz and joins with the Tiara.|$|E
25|$|In 669 CE, {{long after}} the fort was {{abandoned}} in the fourth century, King Egbert granted land to the priest Bassa to build Reculver church. Most of the church was pulled down in 1809 leaving two towers as navigational aids, and sea erosion has removed half of the fort. Anglo-Saxon finds include a large glass beaker with tears found at Broomfield in 1830, a fifth or sixth century wheel-made pottery bowl known as the Marshside Bowl found by the son of farmer Jack Harbour, and a large blue <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> found near Reculver.|$|E
40|$|Since a great {{contribution}} by Beck in 1930 ’s {{in studying}} beads especially in Southeast Asia region, {{a few other}} scholars have been encouraged to study the beauty of beads typologically and scientifically. Lamb for example has published several articles on beads in Southeast Asia {{and other parts of}} the world. Lamb also analyzed scientifically several beads from Kuala Selinsing,Pengkalan Bujang and Takuapa and demonstrated their compositional data. Tom Harrison, who has done a wonderful job on Sarawak beads also reported in his article, a research on Kuala Selinsing <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> Bukit Maras, Santubong associated with Tang and Song ceramics and a Buddha Gupta sculpture and also <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> worn by Kelabit people. These beads have beenanalyzed scientifically and the result showed that Kuala Selinsing <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> have a different compositional content with the Santubong <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and also Kelabit <b>glass</b> <b>beads.</b> Harrison suggested that <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> from Kelabit have Chinese origin based on higher lead content in the beads. In this article, we would like to compare the compositional data of Sarawak <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> with the data taken from Kuala Selinsing, Fort Canning, Singapore and Sungai Mas, Kedah <b>glass</b> <b>beads.</b> The compositional aspect of Santubong, Kelabit, Kuala Selinsing, Sungai Mas and Fort Canning will be analyzed and their differences and similarities will be discussed. According to our research, Bukit Maras, Santubong <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> have a similar composition of elements with the Sungai Mas, Kedah <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and beads worn by Kelabit people are probably not of Chinese origin but have similar content of lead with the glass introduced in Europe in the seventeenth century AD...|$|R

5000|$|The {{technology}} for glass beadmaking {{is among the}} oldest human arts, dating back 3,000 years (Dubin, 1987). <b>Glass</b> <b>beads</b> have been dated back to at least Roman times. Perhaps the earliest glass-like beads were Egyptian faience beads, a form of clay bead with a self-forming vitreous coating. <b>Glass</b> <b>beads</b> are significant in archaeology because the presence of <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> often indicate that there was trade and that the beadmaking technology was being spread. In addition, {{the composition of the}} <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> could be analyzed and help archaeologists understand the sources of the beads.|$|R
25|$|The {{dissipation}} constant is {{a measure}} of the thermal connection of the thermistor to its surroundings. It is generally given for the thermistor in still air, and in well-stirred oil. Typical values for a small <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> thermistor are 1.5mW/°C in still air and 6.0mW/°C in stirred oil. If the temperature of the environment is known beforehand, then a thermistor may be used to measure the value of the dissipation constant. For example, the thermistor may be used as a flow rate sensor, since the dissipation constant increases with the rate of flow of a fluid past the thermistor.|$|E
500|$|The {{first piece}} of {{evidence}} consists of three small objects which contain both of their praenomen next to one another: the aforementioned small <b>glass</b> <b>bead,</b> a small feldspar amulet and a broken stele, {{all of which are}} written in the proper style for the early 18th dynasty. The last stele said that Amenhotep was [...] "given life eternally", which is an Egyptian idiom meaning that a king is alive, but the name of Ahmose does not have the usual epithet [...] "true of voice" [...] which is given to dead kings. Since praenomen are only assumed upon taking the throne, and assuming that both were in fact alive at the same time, it is indicated that both were reigning at the same time. There is, however, the possibility that Amenhotep I merely wished to associate himself with his beloved father, who reunited Egypt.|$|E

25|$|The first {{occupation}} {{phase of}} Chibuene contained {{a multitude of}} <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> <b>glass</b> fragments, and shell <b>beads.</b> <b>Glass</b> <b>beads</b> classified as Zhizo beads have been found at sites further south and in limited numbers in sites further north. These same beads appear less frequently in the later occupation levels in the second millennium. Furthermore, <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> appear most frequently in the early occupation sites and show a dramatic decrease in the later occupation levels. These reveal the significance of Chibuene as an important point of entry for <b>glass</b> and <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> to sites located {{in the interior of}} southern Africa and to a lesser degree regions north of the site.

30|$|According to {{previous}} reports, high shear stress environment may be {{stimulated by the}} addition of <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> in shake flask (Dobson et al. 2008). To study the effects of shear force on TL 1 - 1 synthesis, the test of <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> addition was performed. The data showed that total titer of TL 1 - 1 (750.60  mg/L) was the highest without addition of <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> and it declined with the addition amounts of <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> being increased. TL 1 - 1 concentration was decreased by only 27.2 % when 10 <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> were added (Fig.  2 b). This indicated that shear stress had a negative effect on TL 1 - 1 biosynthesis to a certain extent and another critical factor may be to explore.|$|R

6000|$|Here {{you see the}} bead, and {{the funny}} little {{pictures}} on it. The pictures mean this: [...] "The good Queen Ramaka, the loved of Athor, protectress of Thebes." [...] This Queen Ramaka was {{the wife of a}} king who reigned in Thebes more than three thousand years ago, which is certainly a very long time for a little <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> to remain unbroken! The great city of Thebes, where it was made, has been in ruins for hundreds of years. No doubt this bead was part of a necklace that Queen Ramaka wore, and esteemed as highly as ladies now value their rubies. It was found in the ruins of Thebes by an Englishman.|$|E
6000|$|... 18. To {{go back to}} {{the point}} under discussion. A pearl, or a <b>glass</b> <b>bead,</b> may owe its pleasantness in some degree to its luster as well as to its roundness. But a mere and simple ball of unpolished stone is enough for sculpturesque value. You may have noticed that the quatrefoil used in the Ducal Palace of Venice owes its {{complete}} loveliness in distant effect to the finishing of its cusps. The extremity of the cusp is a mere ball of Istrian marble; and consider how subtle the faculty of sight must be, since it recognizes at any distance, and is gratified by, the mystery of the termination of cusp obtained by the gradated light on the ball.|$|E
40|$|Many <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> {{have been}} found at archaeological sites in Hokkaido Prefecture. Two {{possibilities}} are pointed out in Japanese and Russian documents regarding {{the distribution of the}} <b>glass</b> <b>beads.</b> One theory is that they came from Honsh?, and another suggests that they were from the lower Amur Basin and came to Hokkaido through Sakhalin Island. Since the extent of literary research for these two possibilities are limited, we decided to take a different approach to obtaining information that would lead to finding the origin of the beads. We performed chemical analyses of <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> discovered in Hokkaido by using scanning electron microscope (SEM) with energy dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX).

60|$|Hence the way {{to restore}} {{prosperity}} is not to multiply government departments and government expenditures, nor to appoint commissions and to pile up debts, but to start going again the machinery of bold productive effort. Take off all the excess profits taxes and the super-taxes on income and {{as much of the}} income tax itself as can be done by a wholesale dismissal of government employees and then give industry a mark to shoot at. What is needed now is not the multiplication of government reports, but corporate industry, the formation of land companies, development companies, irrigation companies, any kind of corporation that will call out private capital from its hiding places, offer employment to millions and start the wheels moving again. If the promoters of such corporations presently earn huge fortunes for themselves society is none the worse: and in any case, humanity being what it is, they will hand back a vast part of what they have acquired in return for LL.D. degrees, or bits of blue ribbon, or companionships of the Bath, or whatever kind of <b>glass</b> <b>bead</b> fits the fancy of the retired millionaire.|$|E
60|$|The Kimberley diamond {{deposits}} {{were discovered}} about 1869, I think. When everything is taken into consideration, the wonder {{is that they}} were not discovered five thousand years ago and made familiar to the African world for the rest of time. For this reason the first diamonds were found {{on the surface of the}} ground. They were smooth and limpid, and in the sunlight they vomited fire. They were the very things which an African savage of any era would value above every other thing in the world excepting a <b>glass</b> <b>bead.</b> For two or three centuries we have been buying his lands, his cattle, his neighbor, and any other thing he had for sale, for glass beads and so it is strange that he was indifferent to the diamonds--for he must have picked them up many and many a time. It would not occur to him to try to sell them to whites, of course, since the whites already had plenty of glass beads, and more fashionably shaped, too, than these; but one would think that the poorer sort of black, who could not afford real glass, would have been humbly content to decorate himself with the imitation, and that presently the white trader would notice the things, and dimly suspect, and carry some of them home, and find out what they were, and at once empty a multitude of fortune-hunters into Africa. There are many strange things in human history; one of the strangest is that the sparkling diamonds laid there so long without exciting any one's interest.|$|E

Here is, indeed, {{a drawing}} by Turner, (Edu. 131), in which with some fifty times the {{quantity}} of labour, and far more highly educated faculty of sight, the artist has expressed some qualities of lustre and colour which only very wise persons indeed could perceive in a John Dory; and this piece of paper contains, therefore, much more, and more subtle, art, than the Japan ivory; but are we {{sure that it is}} therefore greater art? or that the painter was better employed in producing this drawing, which only one person can possess, and only one in a hundred enjoy, than he would have been in producing two or three pieces on a larger scale, which should have been at once accessible to, and enjoyable by, a number of simpler persons?

40|$|The {{roughness}} of superhydrophobic silicone nanofilaments (SNFs) is exploited {{to enlarge}} the contact area of conventional filter material. As an efficient wetting of the filter material is crucial for water treatment, the wettability of SNFs is readily modified from superhydrophobic to hydrophilic during the functionalization process. SNFs are coated on <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> and subsequently modified with biocidal silver nanoparticles (AgNPs). The enlarged surface area of SNFs allows a 30 times higher loading of AgNPs in comparison to <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> without SNF coating. Thus, in column experiments, the AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-modified <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> exert superior antibacterial activity towards suspensions of E. coli K 12 compared to AgNP functionalized <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> without SNFs. Additionally, reusing the AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-coated <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> with fresh bacteria contaminated medium increases their efficacy and reduces the colony forming units by ≈ 6 log units. Thereby, the silver loss during percolation is below 0. 1 μg mL− 1. These results highlight, first, the potential of AgNP-SNF-nanocomposite-modified <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> as an effective filter substrate for water disinfection, and second, the efficiency of SNF coating in increasing the contact area of conventional filter material...|$|R

40|$|Studies of Iron Age {{artefacts}} from Britain tend to {{be dominated}} either by the study of metalwork, or pottery. This thesis presents a study not only of a different material, but also {{a different type of}} object: <b>glass</b> <b>beads.</b> These are found in a range of different sizes, shapes, colours, and employ a variety of different decorative motifs. Thus far, <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> have been studied through typology (Guido 1978 a) and compositional analysis (Bertini 2012; Henderson 1982), yet a thorough analysis of the social context of <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> remains absent. Through an analysis of <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> from four key study regions in Britain, this thesis aims not only to address regional differences in appearance and chronology, but also to explore the role that this object played within the networks and relationships that constructed Iron Age society. It seeks to understand how they were used during their lives and how they came to be deposited within the archaeological record, in order to establish the social processes that <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> were bound within. The results indicate that <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> were a strongly regionalised artefact, potentially reflecting differing local preferences for colour and motif. In addition, <b>glass</b> <b>beads,</b> in combination with several other types of object, were integral to Middle Iron Age dress. Given that the first century BC is often seen as a turning point in terms of settlements and material culture, this supports the possibility of strong continental exchange during an earlier period for either <b>glass</b> <b>beads</b> or raw materials. However, by the Late Iron Age in the first century BC and early first century AD, their use had severely diminished...|$|R
