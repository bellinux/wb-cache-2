During Presley's two-year military service in Germany, RCA Victor and Paramount Pictures progressively released material he had completed prior to enlistment. During his last months in the Army, Presley experimented with new sounds and worked on further improving his performance. He also prepared material for his <b>first</b> <b>session</b> in Nashville, which was scheduled to take place upon his return. Presley returned to the United States on March 2, 1960.

5|$|Three {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race: two on Friday {{and one on}} Saturday. The <b>first</b> <b>session</b> ran for 105 minutes, the second 75 minutes, and the third 60 minutes. Conditions were foggy for the <b>first</b> <b>session</b> which cleared up later in the day. Junqueira was fastest in the first practice session {{with a time of}} 31.948 seconds; Tora Takagi was second and Paul Tracy third. Kenny Bräck was fourth-fastest, ahead of da Matta and Patrick Carpentier. Papis, Tony Kanaan, Michel Jourdain Jr. and Roberto Moreno rounded out the session's top ten drivers. Five yellow caution flags came out: the first was for Carpentier who had an engine failure while entering the fourth turn, the second for Bräck when he collided heavily with the turn four outside wall. Adrian Fernández's engine failed which littered debris onto the track, Papis spun after leaving the frontstretch and damaged his rear-end of his car when he hit the pit road exit barrier. A track inspection was necessitated when Castroneves' car leaked fluid onto the circuit.|$|E
5|$|Two {{practice}} sessions were held {{before the race}} on Friday. The <b>first</b> <b>session</b> lasted 80 minutes long, while the second was 85 minutes long.

Denny Hamlin was just off Burton's pace, followed by Kevin Harvick, Kyle Busch, and Brad Keselowski. Kasey Kahne was seventh, still within a second of Kurt Busch's time. Also in the session, Trevor Bayne collided into the wall, so the team had to go to their back-up car. In the second practice session, Kyle Busch was fastest with a time of 26.454 seconds, only one-hundredth of a second quicker than second-placed David Ragan. Edwards took third place, ahead of Jamie McMurray, Greg Biffle and Martin. Newman only managed seventh place.|$|E

5|$|During his <b>first</b> <b>session</b> in Congress, Jennings {{had a small}} {{portrait}} of himself made, which he later gave to Ann Gilmore Hay, {{the daughter of a}} prominent Charlestown politician, whom he had recently begun courting. Hay was born in Harrodsburg, Kentucky, in 1792. Her family moved to Clark County in Indiana Territory, and settled in Charlestown. Jennings first met her when he was campaigning for Congress in 1809. After his <b>first</b> <b>session</b> in Congress ended, Jennings returned to Indiana Territory and married eighteen-year-old Ann on August 8, 1811. Ann's father had just died leaving her with no family or means of support. Following his reelection to Congress in 1811, the couple returned to Washington, where she remained briefly, before traveling to Pennsylvania to live with Jennings's sister, Ann Mitchell, {{for the remainder of the}} session. Jennings's wife suffered from ill health, which deteriorated after he became governor of Indiana in 1816, and she died after a protected illness in 1826. Later that year Jennings married Clarissa Barbee, who had come from Kentucky to teach at the Charlestown seminary. Jennings had no children from either marriage.|$|E
