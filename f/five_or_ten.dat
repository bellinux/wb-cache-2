5|$|The {{method of}} {{construction}} is fairly well understood by historians. The {{patron of the}} aqueduct– a rich individual or the city of Nîmes itself– would have hired a large team of contractors and skilled labourers. A surveyor or mensor planned the route using a groma for sighting, the chorobates for levelling, {{and a set of}} measuring poles <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> Roman feet long. His figures and perhaps diagrams were recorded on wax tablets, later to be written up on scrolls. The builders may have used templates to guide them with tasks that required a high degree of precision, such as carving the standardised blocks from which the water conduit was constructed.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{exchange}} rate is {{the rate at which}} a commercial bank is willing to commit to exchange one currency for another at some specified future date. The {{forward exchange}} rate is a type of forward price. It is the exchange rate negotiated today between a bank and a client upon entering into a forward contract agreeing to buy or sell some amount of foreign currency in the future. Multinational corporations and financial institutions often use the forward market to hedge future payables or receivables denominated in a foreign currency against foreign exchange risk by using a forward contract to lock in a {{forward exchange rate}}. Hedging with forward contracts is typically used for larger transactions, while futures contracts are used for smaller transactions. This is due to the customization afforded to banks by forward contracts traded over-the-counter, versus the standardization of futures contracts which are traded on an exchange. Banks typically quote forward rates for major currencies in maturities of one, three, six, nine, or twelve months, however in some cases quotations for greater maturities are available up to <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> years.|$|E
5|$|The main Japanese air {{offensive}} against the Mariana Islands began in early November 1944. On November1, a B-29 flying from the Marianas overflew the Tokyo region {{for the first}} time. The next day, nine or ten IJN G4Ms belonging to the IJN Attack Hikōtai 703 struck Isley Field and the adjacent Kobler Field on Saipan. The raiders arrived over Saipan shortly after 1:30am and dropped their bombs from low altitude. Only five bombs struck Isley Field, and these caused little damage. A Black Widow from the 6th Night Fighter Squadron shot {{down one of the}} G4Ms and another two were lost to other causes. On November3 the Imperial General Headquarters issued a statement which falsely claimed that Japanese aircraft had bombed and destroyed fifteen locations in Saipan and Tinian. A further attack by either <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> G4Ms with fighter escorts took place at 1:30am on November7, but also caused little damage. The USAAF official history states that three G4Ms were downed in this raid while another source states there were no Japanese losses. Imperial General Headquarters claimed that 20 B-29s out of 40 located were destroyed in the November7 raid. These and all subsequent Japanese air attacks on the Marianas were overseen by the Air Training Army.|$|E

25|$|Vomiting often {{occurs during}} the first hour or two of {{treatment}} with ORS, especially if a child drinks the solution too quickly, but this seldom prevents successful rehydration {{since most of the}} fluid is still absorbed.

25|$|In New Zealand and Australia, the entrée is {{a choice}} of hamburger, cheeseburger, three or six-piece order of Chicken McNuggets, <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> Chicken McBites or a crispy or seared Chicken Snack Wrap; the sides are a choice of french fries or apple slices. Thickshake, boxed {{chocolate}} milk, apple or water pop tops, orange juice, and the traditional soda are choices for drinks.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} legal hurdle to {{the various}} {{construction}} plans because of the existing zoning restrictions in the proposed location for the new buildings. The developed area within the City Park is already five percent over the allowable two percent limit, and this includes the site chosen by {{the government for the}} new museum. The zoning laws are reviewed every <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> years; thereby any current plans would be considered illegal.|$|E

25|$|Masters' Diving {{events are}} {{normally}} conducted in age-groups separated by <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> years, and attract competitors {{of a wide}} range of ages and experience (many, indeed, are newcomers to the sport); the oldest competitor in a Masters' Diving Championship was Viola Krahn, who at the age of 101 was the first person in any sport, male or female, anywhere in the world, to compete in an age-group of 100+ years in a nationally organized competition.|$|E
25|$|We {{did some}} rather audacious things. We shot {{on top of}} a train in Train Town in Griffith Park without a permit, while one of us was given one of the guards money and another of us was talking to another guard, just so we could get the shots finished. We knew we couldn't be there long. All we had to do was do our legerdemain for <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> minutes and be out of there. And we {{certainly}} couldn't pay for it.|$|E

25|$|The {{third time}} a player {{receives}} a penalty, {{it will be}} a personal penalty, meaning he or she will miss the remainder of the match. A substitute can enter the field after <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> minutes. A full game penalty can be received upon using abusive language or directly attacking an opponent and means that the player can neither play nor be substituted {{for the remainder of the}} game. A match penalty is indicated through the use of a red card.|$|E
25|$|CAP may be {{prevented}} by treating underlying illnesses increasing its risk, by smoking cessation and vaccination {{of children and}} adults. Vaccination against haemophilus influenzae and streptococcus pneumoniae {{in the first year}} of life has reduced their role in childhood CAP. A vaccine against streptococcus pneumoniae, available for adults, is recommended for healthy individuals over 65 and all adults with COPD, heart failure, diabetes mellitus, cirrhosis, alcoholism, cerebrospinal fluid leaks or who have had a splenectomy. Re-vaccination may be required after <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> years.|$|E
25|$|All Canadian {{passports}} {{are issued}} by the Passport Program of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC). Prior to July 1, 2013, Canadian passports were issued by Passport Canada, an independent operating agency of Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada. They are normally valid for <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> years for persons 16 {{years of age and}} older, and five years for children under 16. In 2015, 67 per cent of Canadians had passports, and 22.88 million Canadian travel documents were in circulation as of March 31, 2015. Although held by individuals, all Canadian passports remain property of the Government of Canada, as stated on the inside front cover of the booklet.|$|E

25|$|Every {{player has}} {{a limit to}} {{the total number of}} units they can create—a {{population}} limit—but may not immediately use the entire potential population. The population limit increases with the number of houses or town centers in the player's village to a maximum of 200, with each house contributing <b>five</b> (<b>or</b> <b>ten</b> for the Norse) and each town center contributing 20 to the limit. There are two important features for unit management: The idle villager button, which helps players identify villagers that have not been assigned a task, and the town bell, which sends all of the player's villagers into the nearest town center, fortress or tower for safety.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} {{maritime customs}} ports were then: Tunis, Sfax, Mahdia, Jerba, and Gabés (all in Tunisia); Oran, Bougie (Béjaïa), and Bône (Annaba) (in Algeria); and Tripoli (in Libya). At such ports generally, the imports were off loaded {{and transferred to}} a customs area from where they were deposited in a sealed wharehouse, or funduq, until the duties and fees were paid. The amount imposed varied, usually <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> percent. The Tunis customs service was a stratified bureaucracy. At its head was often {{a member of the}} ruling nobility or musharif, called al-Caid, who not only managed the staff collecting duties but also might negotiate commercial agreements, conclude treaties, and act as judge in legal disputes involving foreigners.|$|E
25|$|Taxi {{operations}} are coordinated at each terminal by Massport. Massport's regulations prohibit taxis from picking up fares at any location {{other than the}} designated taxi stands located at curbside on {{the lower levels of}} Terminals A, C and E. For both sides of Terminal B, shuttle van services, limos and taxis all wait for passengers inside the Terminal B Parking Garage on the lower level. Signage inside B terminals directs passengers to the various modes of ground transportation. A large Taxi Pool near the South Cargo complex serves as the staging area for up to 400 taxis, which are typically paged to terminal taxi stands in groups of <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> after waiting for up to ninety minutes or more.|$|E
5000|$|The game {{is played}} by rolling all five cubes and adding up the players score. Any <b>fives</b> <b>or</b> <b>tens</b> rolled are worth that amount. Rolling three {{of a kind of}} any number, or a pair and a [...] "flaming sun", is a [...] "flash" [...] - the swirls are twos, the {{triangular}} glyphs are threes, the lightning bolts are fours, and the stars are sixes. A flash scores ten times the number of one of the dice in the flash. For example, rolling three twos is worth 20 points, and rolling three fives is worth fifty. When a player rolls scoring dice, they must set them aside, and may choose to either keep the points they have, or to roll the non scoring dice and try for more points.|$|R

25|$|On May 5, 2009, Smith was {{assisting}} two Navy divers, Bill Dodd and Corey Seymour, {{who were}} 300 feet from Aquarius using an underwater jackhammer {{to install a}} way station that would contain breathable air. Smith informed Dodd and Seymour that he was returning to Aquarius but would be back. <b>Five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> minutes later, Seymour noticed that Smith was lying on his side in the water, his mouthpiece out of his mouth. Seymour began carrying Smith back to Aquarius, but his air umbilical became fouled about thirty yards from the habitat. Dodd carried Smith {{the rest of the}} distance to Aquarius, where the other divers in the habitat helped them get Smith inside. Resuscitation attempts by Dodd, Seymour, and two Navy physicians who dove to the habitat were unsuccessful. Smith was pronounced dead at 3:25 pm by a Navy doctor. His death was the first associated with the Aquarius program.|$|E
25|$|Much of the {{evidence}} entered against her was from events that had happened <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> years previous. Phillip and Sarah Nelson testified that Robert Shilleto (by then deceased, so he could not affirm or deny the story) had repeatedly complained that Margaret was a witch, afflicting him until he died. Jonathan Burbank, Captain Daniel Wycomb and Frances Wycomb testified that Margaret had come to Burbank's house, asking for corn from his field. (By this time, she had long been widowed.) Burbank initially asked her to wait until he retrieved it from his field, but when she persisted, his wife gave her some. Later, {{when he went to}} get some more corn out of the field, his oxen refused to move, which he attributed to Margaret's bewitching of them. Similarly, Thomas Nelson testified that Margaret repeatedly came to him for wood, for payment of a debt he owed to her. After he denied her, two of his cows died, which he and his neighbors considered unnatural, causing him to conclude Margaret was a witch.|$|E
25|$|The entire Maghrib, {{as well as}} Tunisia {{under the}} early Hafsids, enjoyed an era of {{prosperity}} due {{to the rise of}} Saharan-Sudanese as well as the Mediterranean trade, the latter including trade with Europe. Across the region, repeated buy and sell dealings with Christians {{led to the development of}} practices and structured arrangements at were crafted to ensure security, customs revenue, and commercial profit. The principal customs ports were then: Tunis, Sfax, Mahdia, Jerba, and Gabés (in modern Tunisia); Oran, Bougie (Bejaia), and Bône (Annaba) (in modern Algeria); and Tripoli (in modern Libya). Generally at such ports, the imports were off loaded and transferred to a customs area from where they were deposited in a sealed warehouse, or funduq, until the duties and fees were paid.

The amount of the duties varied, usually <b>five</b> <b>or</b> <b>ten</b> percent. It was possible for an arriving ship to deliver its goods and pick up the return cargo in several days time. Christian merchants of the Mediterranean, usually organized by their city–of–origin, set up and maintained their own trading facilities in these North African customs ports to handle the flow of merchandise and marketing.|$|E
