40|$|Deterring the {{smuggling}} {{of nuclear}} weapons in container freight is critical. Previous work has suggested thatsuch deterrence could be achieved by retaliation threats and partial inspection. However, pre-event declared retaliation threats may not be credible, causing the desired deterrence not to be achieved. In this paper, we extend and complement the work of Haphuriwat et al. (2011) to model credible retaliation threats in a three-stage game, by introducing two additional decision variables and five additional parameters. Our results suggest that noncredible retaliation could be at equilibrium when the reputation loss is low, the reward from the public for retaliation is low, or the costs of retaliation are high. When the declared retaliations are noncredible, we quantitatively show that a higher <b>inspection</b> <b>level</b> {{would be required to}} deter nuclear smuggling than would be needed if retaliation threats are always credible.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{an evaluation of}} promising, mobile non-destructive inspection (NDI) methods for the in-service inspection of composite aerospace structures. The evaluation makes use of carbon fibre reinforced specimens representative for primary composite structures in current and next generation aircraft and helicopters. The specimens comprise solid laminates and sandwich structures with/without stiffeners, and include relevant damage types such as impact damage, interply delaminations and disbonds. A range of promising, mobile NDI methods are evaluated including visual inspection, vibration analysis, ultrasonic inspection (including different phased array methods), shearography and thermography inspection. An {{important aspect of the}} evaluation is the capability of the NDI methods for the detection, sizing and depth estimation of the defects present in the specimens. Further evaluation parameters are the portability of equipment, field of view, couplant requirements, speed of <b>inspection,</b> <b>level</b> of training required and the cost of equipment.

Frony {{discusses the}} importance of Statistical Process Control (SPC) {{in all parts of}} an organization and why it 2 ̆ 7 s a barrier to many. Frony was first introduced to SPC (Statistical Process Control) when she was teaching at the University of Tennessee. An opportunity arose {{to be a part of}} an institute surrounding statistical process control and she jumped in with both feet, deepening her knowledge of Deming. The institute became a place for people to continue learning after Dr. Deming 2 ̆ 7 s 4 -Day Seminar. Frony spent the remainder of her time at U of T working with automotive facilities that wanted to study variation and use SPC. Frony had an opportunity to meet Dr. Deming in 1982 and he completely turned her thinking upside down, especially around Acceptance Sampling Plans. Deming 2 ̆ 7 s theory was that the percentage of defective units in the rest of the lot is independent of the percentage of defective units in your sample. Her mind was blown when she went back and proved this herself. When Frony first learned SPC, it was totally new to her. At first she didn 2 ̆ 7 t realize the impact of knowing common cause and special cause variation. After a number of engagements it became obvious that SPC was 2 ̆ 2 the name of the game 2 ̆ 2. At all levels of the organization, from the <b>inspection</b> <b>level</b> to the management level, she could see instantly what was going on by using SPC. It was a powerful tool to 2 ̆ 2 highlight 2 ̆ 2 what people needed to know to make decision and help improve. Frony finds it fascinating and frustrating that many organizations are aware of SPC but don 2 ̆ 7 t use it. She feels that for some reason, finance systems can compromise improvement.

40|$|Objective　To {{study the}} risk factors of hematoma {{enlargement}} in acute hypertensive cerebral hemorrhage (AHCH) patients within 24 hours after onset. Methods　A retrospective review of clinical data of consecutive patients with AHCH who met the inclusion and exclusion criteria and admitted from Mar. 2008 to Mar. 2013 was performed. The patients' data included patients' demography, previous medical history, clinical features, findings of CT, results of laboratory examinations, {{and the use of}} traditional medicines for promoting blood circulation. Patients were divided into hematoma enlargement group and non-hematomaenlargement group. Univariate analysis was performed on the above factors first, and then with the statistically significant factors used as independent variables, hematoma growth as dependent variables, logistic regression analysis was performed to investigate the possible independent relevant factors for the early enlargement of hematoma in AHCH patients. The risk factors and enlargement of hematoma served as independent variables, the data of mRS scale obtained from 3 -month follow up as dependent variables, logistic regression was then performed to investigate the influence of acute hematoma enlargement during 3 -month follow up in AHCH patients. mRS 0 – 2 was assigned as good recovery, and mRS 3 – 6 as serious disability or death. The <b>inspection</b> <b>level</b> was α= 0. 05. Results　Among 256 patients, 43 (16. 8 %) were found to have hematoma enlargement. Univariate analysis showed {{the risk factors}} led to hematoma enlargement in AHCH patients were gender (male), Glasgow coma scale at admission, NIHSS (National Institute of Health Stroke Scale) at admission, course of disease, and liver function (AST). However, only two factors, namely gender (male) and course of disease, were the independent risk factors of the hematoma enlargement in AHCH patients according to the multivariate regression analysis. In addition, logistic regression revealed that the hematoma enlargement was the independent risk factor influencing the final outcome of AHCH patients, and the hematoma volume, NIHSS, and course of disease were the independent risk factors influencing the outcome of 3 month follow up. Conclusions　A male AHCH patient with shorter duration from onset to admission (within 2 hours) should alert attending physician there would be a risk of hematoma expansion. Larger amount of bleeding, enlarged hematoma, higher NIHSS and shorter duration from onset to admission herald a poor prognosis. 		 		DOI: 10. 11855 /j. issn. 0577 - 7402. 2015. 02. 1...|$|E
40|$|Background: Knee {{osteoarthritis}} (KOA) is {{a chronic}} joint disease that manifests as knee pain {{as well as}} different degrees of lower limb swelling, stiffness, and movement disorders. The therapeutic goal is to alleviate or eliminate pain, correct deformities, improve or restore joint functions, and {{improve the quality of}} life. This study aimed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of Zhuanggu joint capsules combined with celecoxib and the benefit of treatment with Zhuanggu alone for KOA. Methods: This multi-center, randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, parallel controlled trial, started from December 2011 to May 2014, was carried out in 6 cities, including Beijing, Shanghai, Chongqing, Changchun, Chengdu, and Nanjing. A total of 432 patients with KOA were divided into three groups (144 cases in each group). The groups were treated, respectively, with Zhuanggu joint capsules combined with celecoxib capsule simulants, Zhuanggu joint capsules combined with celecoxib capsules, and celecoxib capsules combined with Zhuanggu joint capsule simulants for 4 weeks consecutively. The improvement of Western Ontario and McMaster Universities Osteoarthritis (WOMAC) index and the decreased rates in each dimension of WOMAC were evaluated before and after the treatment. Intergroup and intragroup comparisons of quantitative indices were performed. Statistically significant differences were evaluated with pairwise comparisons using Chi-square test (or Fisher's exact test) and an <b>inspection</b> <b>level</b> of α = 0. 0167. Results: Four weeks after treatment, the total efficacies of Zhuanggu group, combination group, and celecoxib group were 65 %, 80 %, and 64 %, respectively, with statistically significant differences among the three groups (P = 0. 005). Intergroup pairwise comparisons showed that the total efficacy of the combination group was significantly higher than that of the Zhuanggu (P = 0. 005) and celecoxib (P = 0. 003) groups. The difference between the latter two groups was not statistically significant (P > 0. 0167). Four weeks after discontinuation, the efficacies of the three groups were 78 %, 95 %, and 65 %, respectively, with statistically significant differences (P 0. 0167). The incidences of adverse events in Zhuanggu group, combination group, and celecoxib group were 8. 5 %, 8. 5 %, and 11. 1 %, respectively, with insignificant differences (P > 0. 05). Conclusions: Zhuanggu joint capsules alone or combined with celecoxib showed clinical efficacy in the treatment of KOA. The safety of Zhuanggu joint capsules alone or combined with celecoxib was acceptable. Trial Registration: Chinese Clinical Trial Registry, ChiCTR-IPR- 15007267; [URL]...|$|E

40|$|The Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration {{requested}} {{information regarding}} overweight and oversized vehicle traffic entering inspection stations (ISs) {{in order to}} develop strategies for future research efforts and possibly help guide regulatory issues involving overweight commercial motor vehicles (CMVs). For a period of one month, inspection stations in Knox County and Greene County, Tennessee, recorded overweight and oversized vehicles that entered these ISs. During this period, 435 CMVs were recorded using an electronic form filled out by enforcement personnel at the IS. Of the 435 CMVs recorded, 381 had weight information documented with them. The majority (52. 2 %) of the vehicles recorded were five-axle combination vehicles, and 50. 6 % of all the vehicles were permitted to operate above the legal weight limit in Tennessee, which is 80, 000 lb for vehicles with five or more axles. Only 16. 8 % of the CMVs recorded were overweight gross (11. 5 % of permitted vehicles) and 54. 1 % were overweight on an axle group. The low percentage of overweight gross CMVs was because only 45 of the vehicles over 80, 000 lb. were not permitted. On average, axles that were overweight were 2, 000 lb. over the legal limit for an axle or group of axles. Of the vehicles recorded, 172 vehicles were given a North American Standard (NAS) inspection during the assessment. Of those, 69 % of the inspections were driver-only <b>inspections</b> (<b>Level</b> III) and only 25 % of the inspections had a vehicle component (such as a Level I or Level II). The remaining 6 % of inspections did not have valid Aspen numbers; the type of was inspection unknown. Data collected on the types of trailers of each vehicle showed that about half of the recorded CMVs could realistically be given a Level I (full vehicle and driver) inspection; this estimate was solely based on trailer type. Enforcement personnel at ISs without an inspection pit have difficulty fully inspecting certain vehicles due to low clearance below the trailer. Because of this, overweight and oversized vehicles were normally only given a Level III (driver) inspection; thus, {{little is known about the}} safety of these vehicles. The out-of-service (OOS) rate of all the inspected vehicles (driver and vehicle inspections) was 18. 6 %, while the OOS rate for vehicle <b>inspections</b> (<b>Level</b> I and II) was 52. 4 %.

40|$|It is {{acknowledged}} that the most damaging earthquake within the state took place on September 27, 1909 near the Illinois border between Vincennes and Terre Haute. Both nonstructural and structural damage occurred to the buildings in this area, and it was felt strongly in the southwest of Indiana including Indianapolis. Unfortunately, due to the long recurrence interval of strong earthquakes in Mid-America, a large inventory of structures has accumulated without explicit consideration of seismic resistance. Highway bridges are a significant component of this inventory. The seismic vulnerability of highway bridges constructed within the state, especially in southwestern portion of Indiana, presents a problem of serious consequences. The main purpose of this handbook is to provide INDOT personnel of various backgrounds with a rapid and effective methodology for the post-earthquake safety inspection of bridges and roads in Indiana. This methodology is intended to promote and maintain the uniformity of the inspection {{as much as possible}} while assessing and rating bridge and road damage. This handbook contains the material necessary for a systematic safety evaluation of bridge structures and roads {{for a wide range of}} INDOT personnel.
