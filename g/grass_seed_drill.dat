50|$|While the Babylonians used {{primitive}} <b>seed</b> <b>drills</b> around 1500 BCE, {{the invention}} never reached Europe. Multi-tube iron <b>seed</b> <b>drills</b> were invented by the Chinese in the 2nd century BCE. This multi-tube <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> has {{been credited with}} giving China an efficient food production system that allowed it to support its large population for millennia. This multi-tube <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> may have been introduced into Europe following contacts with China. In the Indian subcontinent, the <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> was in widespread use among peasants {{by the time of}} the Mughal Empire in the 16th century.|$|R
50|$|The <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> was {{introduced}} from China to Italy in the mid-16th century {{where it was}} patented by the Venetian Senate. Jethro Tull invented an improved <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> in 1701. It was a mechanical seeder which distributed seeds evenly across a plot of land and at the correct depth. Tull's <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> was very expensive and not very reliable and therefore {{did not have much}} of an impact. Good quality <b>seed</b> <b>drills</b> were not produced until the mid-18th century.|$|R
30|$|The fodder {{producers}} {{cited the}} inability of market outlets to buy <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> at times and low prices offered for <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> as their main challenges in the marketing of their produce. Independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders and the bulking and processing agents mainly faced the challenges of poor quality of seeds due to improper post-harvest handling by producers. Such included inadequate drying, immature seeds and seeds mixed with chaff. The independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders experienced delay in payment when organizations bought <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> on contractual terms. The high cost of an independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> trader certificate which is issued by the Kenya Plant Health Inspectorate Service (KEPHIS) was also cited as a challenge.|$|R
30|$|At {{the second}} stage, there are group and {{individual}} fodder farmers who produce and sell <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> to various agents along the chain. Other actors involved in <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> production included KVDA, RAE Trust and KALRO. The <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> production activities {{of these organizations}} not only serve as demonstrations to the local community but also include sale of the produced <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> for income. The agents involved in processing {{were found to be}} RAE Trust, KVDA and KALRO which bulk, process and market the <b>grass</b> <b>seeds.</b> The actors involved in marketing included farmers who sell their produce to other farmers, KVDA, RAE Trust and KALRO. In addition, there are independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders who buy the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> from the producers and sell to farmers and various non-governmental organizations. KVDA, KALRO and RAE Trust sell the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> to fodder farmers and various organizations in Baringo and other counties such Laikipia, West Pokot and Turkana. The consumers were found to be mainly the residents of Baringo and other counties who buy <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> for planting which entails the establishment of new pastures and reseeding that involves the establishment of pastures in fields previously with pastures.|$|R
30|$|Pastoral {{households}} are increasingly practising fodder production {{in response to}} forage scarcity associated with land degradation, climate variability and change. Understanding the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> value chain {{is a prerequisite for}} developing sustainable fodder production and guiding appropriate out-scaling in the drylands. This study investigated the producers’ perspectives on <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> production, marketing and challenges faced along the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> value chain in Marigat Sub-County of Baringo County, Kenya. The results show that the dominant actors were the bulking and processing agents who provided inputs and were a source of <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> market to the producers. The producers preferred contractual agreements that allowed them to sell their <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> to markets of their choice. As independent <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> traders allowed for seed price negotiation, they were popular amongst the producers and thus handled the most volume of seeds marketed. Drought occurrence, inability of existing outlets to purchase <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> at times, together with low prices offered for producers’ <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> were found to be among the challenges facing the producers. There is need to strengthen the fodder groups with a possibility of registering them as cooperatives for the purpose of collective bargaining for better <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> prices.|$|R

50|$|The {{first known}} European <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> was {{attributed}} to Camillo Torello and patented by the Venetian Senate in 1566. A <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> was described in detail by Tadeo Cavalina of Bologna in 1602. In England, the <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> was further refined by Jethro Tull in 1701 in the Agricultural Revolution. However, <b>seed</b> <b>drills</b> of this and successive types were both expensive and unreliable, as well as fragile. <b>Seed</b> <b>drills</b> would not come into widespread use in Europe until the mid-19th century. Early drills were small enough to be pulled by a single horse, {{and many of these}} remained in use into the 1930s. The availability of steam, and later gasoline tractors, however, saw the development of larger and more efficient drills that allowed farmers to seed ever larger tracts in a single day.|$|R
30|$|In the wet {{season of}} September to December 2013, {{a total of}} 7.42 tonnes of <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> were {{produced}} by the interviewed groups and households and only 4.65 tonnes were sold. Three organizations, RAE Trust, KVDA and KALRO, {{were involved in the}} processing of <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> in the study area. Their functions entailed collection of <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> from the producers, sorting of the collected seeds from chaff and packaging the seeds for sale. The role played by the bulking and processing agents of sorting the collected seeds from chaff shows that the producers need more training on <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> harvesting and handling practices. This may help them fetch better prices for their <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> when offered for sale as the quality of the produce will be high.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{examines}} how two <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> industries respond {{to changes in}} the production environment. Two sets of factors are necessary to understand what adjustments would be made. First, it is necessary to know the nature of the markets and whether market power is being exerted. Second we need to know the relative demand and supply elasticities for the products. The Oregon cool season <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> industry is selected for a number of reasons. First, the banning or restriction of <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> burning is a legislative change that would increase production costs. Second, U.

5000|$|A <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> is {{a device}} that sows the seeds for crops by {{metering}} out the individual seeds, positioning them in the soil, and covering them to a certain average depth. The <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> sows the <b>seeds</b> at equal distances and proper depth, ensuring that the seeds get covered with soil and are saved from being eaten by birds. Before {{the introduction of the}} <b>seed</b> <b>drill,</b> a common practice was to plant seeds by hand. Besides being wasteful, planting was usually imprecise and led to a poor distribution of seeds, leading to low productivity. The use of a <b>seed</b> <b>drill</b> can improve the ratio of crop yield (seeds harvested per seed planted) by as much as nine times.|$|R
40|$|The {{topic of}} the {{bachelor}} thesis is The Benefits of <b>Grass</b> <b>Seeds</b> Production for a Farm. The theoretical part summarizes {{the history of the}} <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> industry in the Czech Republic and deals with the current situation of <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> production. There is described the development and actual state of <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> production in terms of quantities, cultivated species and yields. Subsequently, there is compared the situation in the Czech Republic with foreign countries. The work also characterizes the technology of growing of Italian Rye grass, {{as one of the most}} widely cultivated representatives of grass species used for seed production in the Czech Republic. The practical part is devoted to list and description of the benefits of <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> production from the farmer point of view. They are benefits, which include in particular the improvement of soil fertility and production of forage for feed purposes, and benefits beyond agricultural activities [...] for example erosion control and soil protecting function as well as bioenergetics.

40|$|<b>Grass</b> <b>seed</b> growing is {{fundamental}} to modern agriculture. The aim of this bachelor thesis is the evaluation of <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> growing under the conditions of ecological and conventional agriculture. The main problem {{is the lack of}} ecological certificated <b>grass</b> <b>seeds,</b> because the reproduction of them is difficult under ecological farming methods. Ecological grass reproduction must meet the same legislative requirements as convetional grass reproduction - of course, on condition the use of agrotechnological methods that agree with ecological agriculture law. The initiation of <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> growing without the application of pesticides is more demanding on the treatment of agriculture land before sowing, also, the treating of grass cover during vegetation period and subsequent harvest or after harvest seed treatment is more difficult as for working processions, therefore also more expensive. According to ascertained knowledge, we can conclude that there are relatively high demands for ecological agriculture technology, nevertheless, <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> growing under the conditions of ecological agriculture is justifiable...|$|R

Globally, the largest producer and exporter of <b>grass</b> and legume <b>seeds</b> is America (USA), which is followed by the block of European Union (EU 15) countries, Canada and New Zealand. <b>Grass</b> <b>seeds</b> vastly produced are from annual and perennial varieties of ryegrasses, and much of the production is consumed within the various production regions, particularly by the USA and within the EU (Wong 2005). Ryegrass production has high returns, and consumers, as compared to producers, are purchasing the most <b>grass</b> <b>seeds</b> as they tend to purchase coated seeds so as to increase water retention or seeds enclosed in mulch which makes planting easier (Paul 2013). In the USA, Oregon State produces about a third of the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> on the world market and its <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> industry has had success in China. Together with other actors, it was involved in the development of the Chinese <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> market. Its initial aim was to help Chinese grassland specialists apply modern techniques to grassland problems such as soil erosion (Durham et al. 2003). In Ireland, new technology in the <b>grass</b> <b>seed</b> market is driven by the opening up of beef export markets in China and the United States, the abolition of quotas and the Irish government’s publicized commitment to increasing dairy output (Moran 2015).|$|R
