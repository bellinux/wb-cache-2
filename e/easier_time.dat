5|$|For Register of Wills, as for City Controller, the Republicans had {{a primary}} fight between the Hamilton-Meade regulars and the Meehan faction. As in that contest, the regulars were victorious, nominating Robert C. Duffy, {{attorney}} and former football star, with 67,283 votes. In second came Meehan's man, Morris J. Root, with 42,977, and William P. Shermer, an independent candidate, with 8,909. The Democrats had an <b>easier</b> <b>time</b> nominating former Congressman Francis R. Smith, who trounced Joseph F. Amodie, 40,582 to 5,470. The general election contest {{was one of}} the closest on the ballot but the Republican, Duffy, still defeated the Democrat by more than 7,500 votes.|$|E
5|$|Since neither Manchester United nor Bayern Munich had {{won their}} {{respective}} leagues in 1997–98, both sides faced a qualifier {{to enter the}} 1998–99 Champions League. Manchester United were drawn against Polish champions ŁKS Łódź and won 2–0 on aggregate, goals from Ryan Giggs and Andy Cole in the first leg at Old Trafford giving them the victory. Bayern Munich had an <b>easier</b> <b>time</b> against Yugoslavian champions Obilić, winning 4–0 in the first leg at the Olympiastadion with goals from Stefan Effenberg, Giovane Élber, Alexander Zickler and Thorsten Fink, all scored {{in the space of}} 17 second-half minutes. In the second leg, played at Partizan's ground in Belgrade, an 88th-minute goal from Lothar Matthäus rescued a 1–1 draw to give Bayern a 5–1 win on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|After 1999, {{the only}} member of the Keating Five {{remaining}} in the U.S. Senate was John McCain, who had an <b>easier</b> <b>time</b> gaining re-election in 1992 than he anticipated. He survived the political scandal in part by becoming friendly with the political press. McCain subsequently ran for president in 2000 and became the Republican presidential nominee in 2008. During the 2000s, several retrospective accounts of the controversy reiterated the contention that McCain was included in the investigation primarily so that there would be at least one Republican target. Glenn's inclusion in the investigation has been attributed to Republicans who were angered by the inclusion of McCain, as well as committee members who thought that dropping Glenn (and McCain) would make it look bad for the remaining three Democratic Senators.|$|E

The new Department of Administration, placed {{under the control of}} the Indiana Secretary of State, was created to streamline many state agencies. The state highway department was compelled reorganized, by replacing the commission that ran it with an executive director who was required to be a civil engineer, and replacing its patronage position with a merit system of hiring.|$|E
25|$|Honda had an <b>easier</b> <b>time</b> {{expanding}} in the U.S. than in Japan, where Honda {{first began}} as a motorcycle manufacturer, only later entering the automobile market in competition with other established competitors including Toyota and Nissan. By 1983, Honda had 805 dealerships in the U.S. In the early 1990s, Honda sold two cars in the U.S. for every one car it sold in Japan. In 1990, American Honda took up residence in its current headquarters facility in Torrance, California. Following the death of founder Soichiro Honda in 1991, the company's global operations were re-organized, forming four regional operations including North America.|$|E

25|$|In {{the fall}} of 2012, The Weather Channel began to assign names to major winter storm systems. The channel's {{management}} stated the decision to start naming notable winter storms came {{as a way to}} more easily spread knowledge and raise awareness. By naming winter storms, TWC stated that the public would find it easier to follow storm information, social media will be able to refer to and discuss the storm, and people will have an <b>easier</b> <b>time</b> referring to the storm after it occurs. Most independent sources identify the use of winter storm names by The Weather Channel as a form of SEO-friendly branding.|$|E
25|$|Fish tend {{to prefer}} shoals {{made up of}} {{individuals}} that match their own size. This makes sense as predators have an <b>easier</b> <b>time</b> catching individuals that stand out in a shoal. Some fish may even prefer shoals of another species if this means a better match in current body size. As for shoal size however, hunger can affect the preference for similarly-sized fish; large fish, for example, might prefer to associate with smaller ones because of the competitive advantage they will gain over these shoalmates. In golden shiner, large satiated fish prefer to associate with other large individuals, but hungry ones prefer smaller shoalmates.|$|E
25|$|The Washington Times {{reported}} in 2000 that although migrant labourers {{play a major}} role in spreading wealth in Chinese villages, they are treated 'like second-class citizens by a system so discriminatory that it has been likened to apartheid.' Anita Chan also posits that China's household registration and temporary residence permit system has created a situation analogous to the passbook system in South Africa which was implemented to control the supply and actions of cheap labourers from underprivileged ethnic groups, as well as to control the quality and quantity of such labourers. In 2000, the Tibetan Centre for Human Rights and Democracy alleged that people of Han descent in Tibet have a far <b>easier</b> <b>time</b> acquiring the necessary permits to live in urban areas than ethnic Tibetans do.|$|E

25|$|By {{this time}} the {{programme}} was benefiting from publicity gained after it became known that Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher was a regular listener. Ministers thus became keen {{to go on the}} programme, but the tough, confrontational interviewing they encountered led to accusations that the BBC was biased. Criticism was particularly directed against Redhead, who was often seen as being on the left. Chancellor Nigel Lawson accused him of having been a Labour voter all his life during a live interview, in 1988. The style of the male interviewers was analysed and contrasted with the approach of MacGregor, who was alleged to be giving subjects an <b>easier</b> <b>time.</b> The 'Big 8.10' interview that follows the 8 o'clock news had become an important institution of British politics, a position it retains.|$|E
25|$|The Australians {{had reached}} the final after a hard fought 30–20 Semi-final win over New Zealand at the McAlpine Stadium which had gone into extra time after the score was locked at 20-all after 80 minutes. Their opponents and tournament host England, had an <b>easier</b> <b>time</b> {{defeating}} Wales 25–10 in their Semi at Old Trafford. Even though they were favoured to win, Australia went into the final having lost three of their past four games at Wembley (the only win being the World Cup final of 1992), and had already lost the opening match of the tournament there to the English. Also, due to the ARL's policy of not selecting Super League aligned players, the Kangaroos went into the game with 11 of their 17 players {{under the age of}} 24. Although considered mostly a 'second string' team without the likes of Laurie Daley, Ricky Stuart, Andrew Ettingshausen, Steve Renouf, Steve Walters and Glenn Lazarus, most of the Kangaroos had played in the 3–0 whitewash of New Zealand in the Trans-Tasman series earlier in the year. Kangaroos captain and five-eighth Brad Fittler and fullback Tim Brasher were the only members of Australia's 1992 World Cup Final win over Great Britain at Wembley, with both players in the same positions as they had been three years previously.|$|E
500|$|In October 2011, {{scientists}} found using spectroscopy that cosmic dust contains complex organic compounds ("amorphous organic solids with a mixed aromatic-aliphatic structure") {{that could be}} created naturally, and rapidly, by stars. The compounds are so complex that their chemical structures resemble the makeup of coal and petroleum; such chemical complexity was previously thought to arise only from living organisms. [...] These observations suggest that organic compounds introduced on Earth by interstellar dust particles could serve as basic ingredients for life due to their surface-catalytic activities.

500|$|Gameplay in the Super Smash Bros. series {{differs from}} many {{fighting}} games. Instead of winning by depleting an opponent's life bar, players seek to launch their opponents {{off the stage}} {{and out of the}} map. Characters have a damage total which rises as they take damage, represented by a percentage value that measures up to 999%. As a character's percentage rises, the character can be knocked progressively farther by an opponent's attacks. To knock out an opponent, the player must knock that character outside the arena's boundaries in any direction. When a character is launched off the stage, the character can attempt to [...] "recover" [...] by using jumping moves and abilities to return to the stage. Some characters have an <b>easier</b> <b>time</b> recovering onto the stage than others due to their moves and abilities. Additionally, some characters vary in weight, with lighter characters being easier to launch than heavy characters.|$|E
500|$|After the 1947 season ended, Indians owner Bill Veeck put Seerey on {{a strict}} diet and {{exercise}} regimen for the offseason, stating {{that he had to}} lose 35 pounds if he wanted to remain on the team. By the start of spring training, he had reached his goal of 195 pounds, and felt like he had an <b>easier</b> <b>time</b> swinging the baseball bat as a result. After a good month of spring training, Boudreau named him the starter in right field for the 1948 season, saying that [...] "he'll be in there until he stops hitting." [...] Shortly afterwards, Seerey was removed from the starting lineup, and he ended up playing 10 games for the Indians before being traded. On June 2, Seerey was traded with Al Gettel to the White Sox for Bob Kennedy due to his inconsistency as well as an overstocked group of outfielders on the roster.|$|E

500|$|Russell again excelled {{during the}} 1964–65 season. The Celtics won a league-record 62 games, and Russell {{averaged}} 14.1 points and 24.1 rebounds per game, winning his second consecutive rebounding title and his fifth MVP award. In the 1965 NBA Playoffs, the Celtics played the Eastern Division Finals against the Philadelphia 76ers, {{who had recently}} traded for Wilt Chamberlain. Russell held Chamberlain {{to a pair of}} field goals in the first three quarters of Game 3. In Game 5, Russell contributed 28 rebounds, 10 blocks, seven assists and six steals. However, that playoff series ended in a dramatic Game 7. Five seconds before the end, the Sixers were trailing 110–109, but Russell turned over the ball. However, when the Sixers' Hall-of-Fame guard Hal Greer inbounded, John Havlicek stole the ball, causing Celtics commentator Johnny Most to scream: [...] "Havlicek stole the ball! It's all over! Johnny Havlicek stole the ball!" [...] After the Division Finals, the Celtics had an <b>easier</b> <b>time</b> in the NBA Finals, winning 4–1 against the Los Angeles Lakers of Jerry West and Elgin Baylor.|$|E
500|$|The Super Smash Bros. {{series is}} a {{departure}} from many fighting games; instead of winning by depleting an opponent's life bar, Smash Bros. players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage. Each player has a damage total, represented by a percentage, which rises as damage is taken and can exceed 100%, with a maximum damage of 999%. As this percentage rises, the character can be knocked progressively farther by an opponent's attacks. To KO an opponent, the player must send that character flying {{off the edge of}} the stage, which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries, many suspended in an otherwise empty space. When knocked off the stage, a character may use jumping moves in an attempt to return; some characters have longer-ranged jumps and may have an <b>easier</b> <b>time</b> [...] "recovering" [...] than others. Additionally, characters have different weights, making it harder for heavier opponents to be knocked off the edge, but reciprocally harder for them to recover once sent flying.|$|E
500|$|When McKinley, Hanna {{and their}} {{associates}} saw the emotional {{appeal of the}} Bryan campaign for free silver, they decided upon an extensive and expensive effort to educate the electorate. [...] The McKinley campaign had two main offices; one in Chicago, effectively run by Dawes, and one in New York, used by Hanna as a base of operations as he sought to gain support from New York financiers. [...] Hanna's task was to raise the money; other campaign officials, such as Dawes, determined how to spend it. [...] Being relatively unknown on the national scene, Hanna initially had little success, despite Wall Street's fear of Bryan. Some Wall Street titans, although disliking Bryan's positions, did not take him seriously as a candidate and refused {{to contribute to the}} McKinley campaign. Those who did know Hanna, such as his old schoolmate Rockefeller—the magnate's Standard Oil gave $250,000—vouched for him. [...] Beginning in late July 1896, Hanna had an <b>easier</b> <b>time</b> persuading industrialists to give to the McKinley/Hobart campaign. [...] He also gave large sums himself. [...] This money went to pay for advertising, brochures, printed speeches and other means of persuading the voter; the country was flooded with such paper.|$|E
