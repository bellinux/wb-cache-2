We report {{observations of}} SNR W 44 with the Fermi Large Area Telescope at energies between 2 × 108 <b>electron</b> <b>volts</b> and 3 × 1011 <b>electron</b> <b>volts.</b> The detection of a source with a morphology corresponding to the SNR shell implies that the emission is produced by particles accelerated there. The gamma-ray spectrum is well modeled with emission from protons and nuclei. Its steepening above ~ 109 <b>electron</b> <b>volts</b> provides a probe with which to study how particle acceleration responds to environmental effects such as shock propagation in dense clouds and how accelerated particles are released into interstellar space...|$|R

40|$|Before {{the second}} world war, the inner {{workings}} of the nucleus were a mystery. Fermi and collaborators in Rome had bombarded nuclei by neutrons, and the result was a large number of resonance states, evidenced by sharp peaks in the cross section; i. e., in the off-coming neutrons. These peaks were the size of <b>electron</b> <b>volts</b> (eV) in width. (The characteristic energy of a single molecule flying around in the air at room temperature is the order of 1 / 40 of an <b>electron</b> <b>volt.</b> Thus, one <b>electron</b> <b>volt</b> is the energy of a small assemblage of these particles.) On the other hand, the difference in energy between low-lying energy levels in light and medium nuclei is the order of MeV, one million <b>electron</b> <b>volts.</b> Now Niels Bohr’s point [1] was that if the widths of the nuclear levels (compound states) were more than a million times smaller than the typical excitation energies of nuclei, then this meant that the neutron did not just fall into the nucleus and come out again, but that it collided with the many particles in the nucleus, sharing its energy. According to the energy-time uncertainty relation, the width ∆E of such a resonance is related to the lifetime of the state by t ≃ �/∆E ∼ �/(1 eV). In fact, the time t ∼ �/(10 MeV) is the characteristic time for a nucleon to circle around once in the nucleus, the dimension of which is Fermis (1 Fermi = 10 − 13 cm) ...|$|R

The paper investigates and studies chemical adsorption behavior of benzene on single-walled carbon nanotubes (9, 9) and (7, 7) in the gas phase by the Gaussian 09 program and using quantum chemical calculations and density functional theory method (DFT). First, carbon nanotubes were generated by a nanotube modeler, and then benzene was passed through the inside and outside of the nanotubes. After that, the absorption energies were calculated using the B 3 LYP calculation method and 6 - 31 G basic set at different time intervals. Next, the amount of structure energy for carbon nanotube and benzene was separately calculated by the Gaussian 09 program. Using the existing equations, the absorption energy at different time intervals was obtained as follows: For 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, and 2 angstrom outside the nanotube (7, 7), 14. 25, 11. 22, 3. 32, and 0. 78 <b>electron</b> <b>volts</b> (eV); for the nanotube (9, 9),- 776. 34,- 807. 12,- 817. 16, and- 844. 62 <b>electron</b> <b>volts</b> (eV); for the inside of the nanotube (7, 7), 14. 66, 7. 76, 7. 30, and 7. 27 <b>electron</b> <b>volts</b> (eV); and for the nanotube (9, 9),- 813. 69,- 813. 97,- 816. 68, and- 819. 33 <b>electron</b> <b>volts</b> (eV), respectively.

40|$|Massive neutrinos are {{expected}} in most grand unified theories {{that attempt to}} unify the strong and electroweak interactions. So far, heroic laboratory experiments have yielded only upper bounds on the masses of the elusive neutrinos.
