The promo was interrupted when Rhino delivered a Gore. Van Dam's former tag team partner Sabu then appeared following the lights turning off, and had a match with Rhino. Sabu won the match with Van Dam's help, as Van Dam delivered a Van Daminator on Rhino before Sabu delivered the Arabian Skullcrusher on Rhino through a table for the victory.|$|E

Oldman describes himself as 'shy' although a diligent worker during his time at Rose Bruford, where he performed roles such as Puck {{in the performance of}} Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. After leaving school, Oldman was the first in his class to receive professional work.

25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} faulty air temperature probe (the total air temperature sensor, located {{on the front of}} the aircraft near the cockpit) that initially caused the pilot to turn the plane back for maintenance before the second takeoff attempt. The mechanic simply deactivated the probe because the aircraft's Minimum Equipment List allowed it to be left inoperative. On 22 August investigators interviewed the mechanic, who defended his action by saying that <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with the crash. Spanair has supported the mechanic's view that deactivation of the probe is an accepted procedure. On 1 September a report, quoting Spanair, stated that the problem detected on the first takeoff attempt was overheating caused by a temperature gauge's de-icing system, rather than a dysfunction of the temperature gauge itself, and that since icing was not a risk on that flight, the de-icing system had been deactivated by the mechanic with captain's approval.|$|E

Goddard. Goddard would come to be regarded as America's pioneer of rocketry, but many contemporaries regarded him as a crank. Before the war, Bush had gone on the record as saying, [...] "I don't understand how a serious scientist or engineer can play around with rockets", but in May 1944, he was forced to travel to London to warn General Dwight Eisenhower of the danger posed by the V-1 and V-2. Bush could only recommend that the launch sites be bombed, which was done.|$|E

[...] Murphy observed, [...] "I was unbelievably cocky and had nothing to lose, and it suited the part, I suppose." [...] Originally intended to run for three weeks in Cork, Disco Pigs ended up touring throughout Europe, Canada and Australia for two years, and Murphy left both university and his band. Though he had intended to go back to playing music, he secured representation after his first agent caught a performance of Disco Pigs, and his acting career began to take off.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{after her}} {{marriage}} with Ajay Devgn, Kajol {{featured in a}} supporting role alongside him and Mahima Chaudhry in Prakash Jha's drama Dil Kya Kare. She played Nandita Rai, the other woman {{in the life of}} Anant Kishore, played by Devgn. In an interview with Filmfare she explained, [...] "The only reason, I agreed to play my character was because it had shades of grey. I would have probably refused the wife's role. Because I felt <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> for me to do." [...] Upon release, the film met with largely negative reviews. Critic Sharmila Taliculam, however, described Kajol as [...] "the only person who gives her role a semblance of sanity". Commercially too, the film failed to do well. However, her next release, Satish Kaushik's woman's film, the drama Hum Aapke Dil Mein Rehte Hain, emerged as a critical and commercial success. Starring alongside Anil Kapoor, Kajol received another Best Actress nomination at the Filmfare ceremony for her portrayal of Megha, the deceived wife of Kapoor's character. The film met with wide media coverage for being one of the few woman-centered films to emerge as a commercial success in India.|$|E
500|$|According to David Prior, {{producer}} of the subsequent two-disc special edition, the initial bare bones edition [...] "was only reluctantly agreed to by Fincher because I needed {{more time on the}} bonus material. The studio was locked into their release date, so Fincher allowed that version to be released first. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with Fincher 'double dipping his own movie before it even makes it to stores' {{and everything to do with}} buying more time for the special edition". He stated that the theatrical cut would only be available on the single-disc edition. Prior elaborated further: [...] "Nobody wants fans feeling like they're being taken advantage of, and I know that double-dipping creates that impression. That's why it was so important to me that consumers be told there was another version coming. In this case it really was a rock-and-a-hard-place situation, and delaying the second release was done strictly for the benefit of the final product... But this is a very ambitious project, easily the most far-reaching I've ever worked on, and owing largely to studio snafus that I can't really elaborate on, I didn't have enough time to do it properly. Thus Fincher bought me the extra time by agreeing to a staggered release, which I'm very grateful for". [...] In its first week, rentals for the DVD earned $6.7 million.|$|E

The inclusion of Napalm Death's [...] "Twist the Knife (Slowly)" [...] on the Mortal Kombat soundtrack brought the band much greater visibility, as the compilation scored a Top 10 position in the Billboard 200 chart and went platinum {{in less than a}} year.< The originators of the style have expressed some ambivalence regarding {{the subsequent}} popularity of grindcore. Pete Hurley, the guitarist of Extreme Noise Terror, declared that he had no interest in being remembered as a pioneer of this style: [...] "'grindcore' was a legendarily stupid term coined by a hyperactive kid from the West Midlands, and <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>nothing</b> to do with us whatsoever. ENT were, are, and - I suspect - always will be a hardcore punk band... not a grindcore band, a stenchcore band, a trampcore band, or any other sub-sub-sub-core genre-defining term you can come up with." [...] Lee Dorian of Napalm Death indicated that [...] "Unfortunately, I think the same thing happened to grindcore, {{if you want to call}} it that, as happened to punk rock - all the great original bands were just plagiarised by a billion other bands who just copied their style identically, making it no longer original and no longer extreme." ...|$|E

Weeks prior to the game's US release, Enix released new information about the game's different mechanics on their website weekly to introduce players to the game. Paul Handelman, president of Enix America, commented on the game that [...] "All the talk this month about new systems with the latest technological wizardry doesn't diminish the fact {{that at the end of}} the day, compelling game play is what it's all about, and Dragon Warrior VII provides just that." [...] Dragon Warrior VII was released in the US on November 1, 2001 and was the last game in the series to have Warrior in its title instead of Quest. In 2003, Square Enix registered the Dragon Quest trademark in the US, with the intent to retire the Dragon Warrior name. Soon after the game's release, developer Heartbeat went on hiatus. Justin Lucas, product manager of Enix America, commented on the hiatus, saying that the developer merely [...] "worked their tails off on Dragon Warrior 7 and Dragon Warrior 4.

Some news outlets reported that police are looking into a possible link between the attempted bombing and the warnings of violence against Trey Parker and Matt Stone, although no such link has yet been established. Such speculation was also fueled by statements from U.S. Congressman Peter T. King, who described as one possible motive [...] "the whole issue with 'South Park,' which Islamic terrorists were threatening to have retribution for." [...] However, King stressed the theory was [...] "one possibility out of a hundred". Revolution Muslim has denied any involvement with the incident.
