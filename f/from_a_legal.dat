5|$|European {{companies}} which bought foreign patents the Wrights {{had received}} sued other manufacturers in their countries. Those lawsuits were only partly successful. Despite a pro-Wright ruling in France, legal maneuvering dragged {{on until the}} patent expired in 1917. A German court ruled the patent not valid because of prior disclosure in speeches by Wilbur Wright in 1901 and Chanute in 1903. In the U.S. the Wrights made {{an agreement with the}} Aero Club of America to license airshows which the Club approved, freeing participating pilots <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> threat.

In 2001, with over 127,000 adoptions, the U.S. accounted for {{nearly half of the}} total number of adoptions worldwide. Same-sex marriage is legal nationwide and it is legal for same-sex couples to adopt. Polygamy is illegal throughout the U.S.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{unsuccessful}} ventures against Philip and Alexander, the Athenians still respected Demosthenes. In 336BC, the orator Ctesiphon {{proposed that}} Athens honour Demosthenes {{for his services}} to the city by presenting him, according to custom, with a golden crown. This proposal became a political issue and, in 330BC, Aeschines prosecuted Ctesiphon on charges of legal irregularities. In his most brilliant speech, On the Crown, Demosthenes effectively defended Ctesiphon and vehemently attacked those who would have preferred peace with Macedon. He was unrepentant about his past actions and policies and insisted that, when in power, the constant aim of his policies was the honour and the ascendancy of his country; and on every occasion and in all business he preserved his loyalty to Athens. He finally defeated Aeschines, although his enemy's objections to the crowning were arguably valid <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> point of view.|$|E

Judges also retain the right to oversee mandatory reconciliation in the case of divorce, which many women's organizations fear will be used to limit women's autonomy during divorce proceedings.|$|E

25|$|Air rifles {{are well}} suited for hunting small game such as {{squirrels}} and rabbits in commonly available powers. Such hunting is widely practiced in the United States and in the UK. Nonetheless, some states in the United States prohibit the use of air rifles for hunting regardless of the foot pound equivalent (FPE) of the projectile that is launched; for example, Florida prohibits {{the use of any}} air rifle for any hunting. On the other hand, in the UK, 12 FPE is the categorical limit for air rifles used for hunting. Above this muzzle energy rating, air rifles are considered to be firearms <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> standpoint in the UK, and normal firearms regulations apply to these higher power air rifles.|$|E

25|$|Lincoln's {{personal}} communications, {{even from}} {{around the time of}} his To Whom it May Concern letter, indicate that he might have been willing to privately give ground on slavery. That Lincoln proposed a delayed ratification plan is mentioned by the Augusta Chronicle and Sentinel in June 1865—based on a report by Stephens from after the meeting. <b>From</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> standpoint, Lincoln never believed that the federal government had the authority to ban slavery in the states—thus his constant emphasis on the status of the Emancipation Proclamation as a measure effective only during wartime. According to Paul Escott, Lincoln's moral opposition to slavery did not override his understanding of the Constitution; therefore, Lincoln may have believed that the rebel states would have a right to reject the Thirteenth Amendment if they rejoined the Union.|$|E
25|$|<b>From</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> standpoint, the Rorschach test {{images have}} been in the public domain for many years in most countries, {{particularly}} those with a copyright term of up to 70 years post mortem auctoris. They {{have been in}} the public domain in Hermann Rorschach's native Switzerland since 1992 (70 years after the author's death, or 50 years after the cut-off date of 1942), according to Swiss copyright law. They are also in the public domain under United States copyright law where all works published before 1923 are considered to be in the public domain. This means that the Rorschach images may be used by anyone for any purpose. William Poundstone was, perhaps, first to make them public in his 1983 book Big Secrets, where he also described the method of administering the test.|$|E
25|$|Still, neither Alexandra nor Aspasia {{received}} more official recognition: <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>legal</b> point of view, they were commoners with any {{rights in the}} royal family. Things changed from July 1922 when, after the intervention of Queen Sophia, was passed a law which retroactively recognized marriages {{of members of the}} Royal Family, although on a non-dynastic basis; with this legal subterfuge, the little princess obtained the style of Royal Highness and the title of Princess of Greece and Denmark. Thus, Alexandra's birth became legitimate in the eyes of Greek law, but since the marriage was recognized on a 'non-dynastic basis,' her royal status was tenuous at best; however, this belated recognition made it possible for her to make later an advantageous marriage, which {{would not have been possible}} if she was nothing more than the daughter of the King's morganatic spouse.|$|E
