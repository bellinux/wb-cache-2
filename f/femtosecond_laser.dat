25|$|A soft corneal suction ring {{is applied}} to the eye, holding the eye in place. This step in the {{procedure}} can sometimes cause small blood vessels to burst, resulting in bleeding or subconjunctival hemorrhage into the white (sclera) of the eye, a harmless side effect that resolves within several weeks. Increased suction causes a transient dimming of vision in the treated eye. Once the eye is immobilized, a flap is created by cutting through the corneal epithelium and Bowman's layer. This process is achieved with a mechanical microkeratome using a metal blade, or a <b>femtosecond</b> <b>laser</b> that creates a series of tiny closely arranged bubbles within the cornea. A hinge is left at one end of this flap. The flap is folded back, revealing the stroma, the middle section of the cornea. The process of lifting and folding back the flap can sometimes be uncomfortable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract – Progress in {{developing}} high speedAnalog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) occurs rather slowly {{due to the}} inherent jitter in electronic sampling and the difficulty in integrating low noise microwave sources. Currently, this electronic jitter is {{on the order of}} 100 femtoseconds in the most advanced CMOS circuitry. Advances in <b>femtosecond</b> <b>lasers</b> and laser stabilization have {{led to the development of}} sources of ultrafast optical pulse trains that show timing jitter on the level of a few femtoseconds over the time spans of typical sampling windows and can be made even smaller in the future.

40|$|Performance of state-of-the-art, {{electronic}} analog-to-digital converters {{is currently}} {{limited by the}} 100 -fs aperture jitter. However, optical sampling can overcome the jitter limit by using <b>femtosecond</b> <b>lasers</b> that have jitter as low as 100 as, which is a three orders of magnitude improvement when compared to electronics. Currently, most of these lasers exist as bulk or fiber lasers. While such configurations can provide flexibility in order to tailor {{the behavior of the}} lasers to specific needs, they are usually as expensive as $ 10, 000 to $ 100, 000 and require precisely adjustable mounts and high-quality optical components. To realize the possibility of <b>femtosecond</b> <b>lasers</b> replacing current electronics for unprecedented performance in the future, these lasers must be as compact, robust, and affordable as electronic circuits. A monolithically integrated mode-locked laser can lower the cost of building such <b>femtosecond</b> <b>lasers</b> and, at the same time, make them less vulnerable to environmental perturbation. This can be achieved by mass-producing them with less expensive materials such as silicon, silicon oxide, or compatible materials. Since all necessary optical components are integrated monolithically on a silicon substrate, bulky and expensive high-precision discrete components can be excluded. The goal of this thesis is the development of <b>femtosecond</b> <b>lasers</b> that can overcome the limit of electronics and potentially replace them.

50|$|<b>Femtosecond</b> <b>laser</b> {{micromachining}} is {{used for}} device fabrication by milling 'air' holes and/or troughs into ferroelectric crystals by directing them through the focus region of a <b>femtosecond</b> <b>laser</b> beam. This is the first demonstration of convenient, controllable, and rapid large scale damage induced in lithium niobate and lithium tantalate. The advantages of <b>femtosecond</b> <b>laser</b> micromachining {{for a wide range}} of materials have been well documented. In brief, free electrons are created within the beam focus through multiphoton excitation. Because the peak intensity of a <b>femtosecond</b> <b>laser</b> pulse is many orders of magnitude higher than that from longer pulse or continuous wave lasers, the electrons are rapidly accelerated and heated to form a plasma. The electrostatic instability, produced by the plasma, of the remaining lattice ions results in ejection of these ions and hence ablation of the material, leaving a material void in the laser focus region. Since multiphoton excited free electrons are always available at the beam focus, highly uniform and repeatable damage confined to the laser focus region results. Also, since the pulse duration and ablation time scales are much faster than the thermalization time, <b>femtosecond</b> <b>laser</b> micromachining does not suffer from the adverse effects of a heat-affected-zone, like cracking and melting in regions neighboring the intended damage region.|$|E
