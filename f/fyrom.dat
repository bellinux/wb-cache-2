5000|$|The {{country has}} a dispute over its name with its {{southern}} neighbour and current EU member Greece. Greece rejects the name [...] "Macedonia" [...] because it says it implies territorial ambitions towards Greece's own northern province of Macedonia (see: Macedonia naming dispute).

Concerns over the country's difficulties in reaching European standards on {{the rule of law}} and the economy and over violence and irregularities in the 2008 parliamentary elections have also cast doubts on the country's candidacy.

The other parties and the President of the Republic, he said, were informed but the solution process didn't work, because the Tetovo crisis broke out." [...] The Academy of Athens concludes: The adoption of a compound name with a geographic content and with respect for the distinction between ancient Macedonia and the state of <b>FYROM,</b> would serve both the truth and the present-day needs of the geographic region and of the larger area surrounding it. The Greek interest does indicate the concern of public opinion in the face of intransigent provocations on the part of Skopje that tend—as is evident even in the school textbooks—not only to appropriate but even to monopolise the history, the cultural achievements, the symbols—including the ancient ones—the monuments, and the personalities that were active in the Macedonian area in the past. It is self-evident that the expression of good will on the part of any Greek government is not sufficient to overcome the fact or the effects of nationalist excesses similar to those that were artfully cultivated during the post-war period.|$|E
40|$|<b>FYROM</b> {{has a long}} {{tradition}} of producing wine. Wine production in <b>FYROM</b> {{is one of the greatest}} contributors of the agricultural share of their GDP. The aim of the thesis is to see if the wine production in <b>FYROM</b> has a comparative advantage compared to other countries that produce wine and if <b>FYROM</b> is able to sustain the advantage in the future. The countries chosen for comparison are Bulgaria, Croatia, France and Italy. The methods used in the thesis are the Balassa Index and Porter’s Diamond of National Advantage. These economic tools address the comparative advantage of a nations sector of production. The calculation of the Balassa Index show that <b>FYROM</b> has a comparative advantage in wine production in respect to Bulgaria and Croatia, but not compared to France and Italy. The vineyards are outdated and the vines and grapes do not meet the foreign market demands in respect to quality of the wine produced. There is therefore a need of a renewal of the vineyards to improve the quality. The economic situation of the wine farmers requires aid from the government for the renewal and for <b>FYROM</b> to sustain and strengthen their comparative advantage...|$|E

40|$|The {{global economy}} crisis {{confirmed}} {{the need for}} development of the production sector in <b>FYROM</b> as a key element for decreasing the trade deficit. The effects of the crisis show that <b>FYROM</b> does not have economic structure capable for development without inflow of foreign capital. The question whether <b>FYROM</b> economic structure is compatible to current level of development and whether the country has sustainable economic development {{in the last ten}} to fifteen years should be answered negatively. In fact, the last economic crisis confirmed that the development model that <b>FYROM</b> applied is not sustainable. Although the privatization process finished, the private ownership and liberalization do not show the expected effects. The companies are not competitive in the international markets, and did not start to create new productive jobs in manufacturing and export oriented sectors. On a macro level, there has been a development model based on fixed exchange rate of the domestic currency and weak economy, chronic trade deficit and reliance on the foreign capital inflow. Obviously, the economic model should be changed. <b>FYROM</b> needs radical change of the economic policy, with fast restructuring of the economy and new economic and legal conditions for investments in manufacturing and other export-oriented economy sectors. All these should be done parallel to general development of infrastructure and human resources. In order to start the investment cycle, which will invoke faster economic development, {{there is a need for}} change in the economic structure, which can be analyzed by the structure of GDP, as the main macroeconomic aggregate in the economy...|$|E

40|$|The recent (2001) crisis {{inside the}} Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (<b>FYROM)</b> {{concerning}} its Albanian ethnic minority {{did not come}} as a surprise to the southeastern European as well as the international security chessboard. It had nearly been predicted from the first years of the new state's independent life, and confirmed by most analysts during and after the war in Kosovo (1998 - 99). This thesis will examine the survivability of the small post-cold war Balkan state, in relation to the historical background of the Macedonian Questiongas, the so-called Macedonian Identitygas, the resurgence of nationalist inclinations in the area, the ethnic minorities (especially the Albanian one), the economy, and the regional (four neighboring states) as well as the international relations of <b>FYROM.</b> The author will argue that prevention of conflict in <b>FYROM</b> is urgent for the stability of all the Balkans, and has to be coordinated from the international community towards all governmental and non-governmental actors involved. Integration of <b>FYROM</b> into European institutions provides a reliable measure. Respect and protection of human/civil rights of minorities, as well as democratization of the civilian sector are also dominant factors for the survival of the multi-ethnic nation. Ethnic minorities should finally develop proper political, social, and economic relationships with majority populations in order to work together for the common well being...|$|E
