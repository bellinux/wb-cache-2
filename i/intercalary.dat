5|$|German ethnologist Thomas Barthel, {{who first}} {{published}} the rongorongo corpus, identified three {{lines on the}} recto (side a) of tablet C, also known as Mamari, as a lunar calendar. Guy proposed {{that it was more}} precisely an astronomical rule for whether one or two <b>intercalary</b> nights should be inserted into the 28-night Rapanui month to keep it in sync with the phases of the moon, and if one night, whether this should come before or after the full moon. Berthin and Berthin propose that it is the text which follows the identified calendar which shows where the <b>intercalary</b> nights should appear. The Mamari calendar is the only example of rongorongo whose function is currently accepted as being understood, though it cannot actually be read.|$|E
5|$|Radius and Media (R+M) – {{third and}} fourth {{longitudinal}} vein, the strongest vein on the wing, with branches, R1-R4, reach the wing margin, the media anterior (MA) are also reach the wing margin. IR2 and IR3 are <b>intercalary</b> veins behind R2 and R3 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The Bahá'í {{calendar}} {{is based}} upon the calendar established by the Báb. The year consists of 19 months, each having 19 days, with four or five <b>intercalary</b> days, to make a full solar year. The Bahá'í New Year corresponds to the traditional Persian New Year, called Naw Rúz, and occurs on the vernal equinox, near 21 March, {{at the end of the}} month of fasting. Bahá'í communities gather at the beginning of each month at a meeting called a Feast for worship, consultation and socializing.|$|E
5|$|In {{some very}} small insects, the venation may be greatly reduced. In Chalcidoidea (Chalcid wasps), for instance, only the subcosta {{and part of}} the radius are present. Conversely, an {{increase}} in venation may occur by the branching of existing veins to produce accessory veins or by the development of additional, <b>intercalary</b> veins between the original ones, as in the wings of Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets). Large numbers of cross-veins are present in some insects, and they may form a reticulum as in the wings of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and {{at the base of the}} forewings of Tettigonioidea and Acridoidea (katydids and grasshoppers respectively).|$|E
5|$|The {{mechanical}} pressure {{exerted by}} the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations {{such as these}} are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by elongation at the tip (apex) of the hypha. Other forms of fungal growth include <b>intercalary</b> extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) {{as in the case}} of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and intercellular communication.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in {{the summer}} of 54 BC, a wave of {{political}} corruption and violence swept Rome. This chaos reached a climax in January 52 BC, when Clodius was murdered in a gang war. In addition, the civil unrest had caused the calendar to become neglected. The calendar required annual adjustments to prevent its drift relative to any Spring Equinox, and so to correct the misalignment of the calendar, an <b>intercalary</b> month was inserted at the end of February 52 BC, and Pompey was elected sole Consul for that month. This elevation to extraordinary power was the last straw for Caesar, and with Crassus dead, Pompey was looking for any excuse with which to crush Caesar, and establish himself as the master of the state. On January 1, 49 BC, an agent of Caesar named Gaius Scribonius Curio presented an ultimatum to the senate, but the ultimatum was rejected, and the senate then passed a resolution which declared that if Caesar did not lay down his arms by July of that year, that he would be acting adversus rem publicam (in effect, declaring him to be an enemy of the republic). On January 7, 49 BC, the senate passed a senatus consultum ultimum, which suspended civil government and declared something analogous to martial law. Pompey, in effect, was vested with Dictatorial powers, but his army was composed largely of untested conscripts. Caesar then crossed the Rubicon river with his veteran army, and marched towards Rome. Caesar's rapid advance forced Pompey, the Consuls and the senate to abandon Rome for Greece, and Caesar entered the city unopposed.|$|E
25|$|The {{calendar}} {{seems to}} have employed several schedules to determine which of the 19 years will be <b>intercalary</b> years. To find out which year will have an <b>intercalary</b> month, divide the Burmese year by 19. The quotient is the expired cycles. The remainder, if tallies with the set sequence number of the prevailing Metonic cycle, {{then it will be}} an <b>intercalary</b> year.|$|E
25|$|<b>Intercalary</b> cells react identically {{to those}} of {{granular}} glands but on a smaller scale. Among the amphibians, there are taxa which contain a modified <b>intercalary</b> region (depending on {{the function of the}} glands), yet the majority share the same structure.|$|E
25|$|The {{new system}} was a hybrid between the {{original}} and the updated Surya schools. Unlike the new Surya, Thandeikta does not adopt the system of apparent reckoning; mean years and mean months are still used. It also retains the practice of placing the <b>intercalary</b> month always next to Waso and the <b>intercalary</b> day always {{at the end of}} Nayon, and only in a year which has an <b>intercalary</b> month. But Thandeikta follows the new Surya in small alterations of the length of the year and the month. The prevailing Metonic schedule was modified, and <b>intercalary</b> months were so fixed as to prevent further divergence between the solar and luni-solar years. With the support of Princess Sekkya Dewi, who later became the chief queen of King Mindon, the new system was fully adopted in 1853. The first adjustment to then existing Metonic Cycle was made by putting an <b>intercalary</b> month in 1201 ME (1839 CE) instead of 1202 ME (1840).|$|E
25|$|There {{is another}} theory {{which says that}} in <b>intercalary</b> years February had 23 or 24 days and Intercalaris had 27. No date is offered for the Regifugium in 378-day years. Macrobius {{describes}} a further refinement whereby, in one 8-year period within a 24-year cycle, {{there were only three}} <b>intercalary</b> years, each of 377 days. This refinement brings the calendar back in line with the seasons, and averages the length of the year to 365.25 days over 24 years.|$|E
25|$|Moreover, Chulasakarat uses three {{similar but}} not {{identical}} types of lunar years {{used by the}} Burmese calendar. Each calendar has the same regular year of 354 days and a leap year of 384 days. However, whereas the Burmese calendar adds the <b>intercalary</b> day only in a leap cycle according to its Metonic cycle, the Siamese calendar adds the <b>intercalary</b> day to a regular year. The Siamese calendar does add the extra day {{in the same place}} (Jyestha/Nayon), however.|$|E
25|$|In sum, {{at various}} times the {{calendar}} has used at least three slightly different methods of calculation to determine the insertion times of the <b>intercalary</b> day and month.|$|E
25|$|The {{observational}} {{determination of}} the time of solstice would not have served a practical (agricultural) purpose, but could have been used to maintain a lunisolar calendar (i.e. knowledge of the date of solstice allows an accurate handling of <b>intercalary</b> months).|$|E
25|$|The Bahá'í {{calendar}} {{is composed}} of 19months, each with 19days. The Nineteen Day Fast is held during the final month of ‘Alá’, and is preceded by the <b>intercalary</b> days, known as Ayyám-i-Há. The month of fasting is followed by Naw-Rúz, the new year.|$|E
25|$|The Thai Chulasakarat {{calendar}} uses {{a slightly}} different method to place the <b>intercalary</b> day. Instead {{of it in a}} leap year as in the Burmese system, the Thai system places it in a separate year. Thus, the Thai small leap year has 355 days while the Thai great leap year has 384 days. Both systems arrive at the same number of days in a 19-year cycle however. Furthermore, in contrast to Indian calendars, the Burmese calendar follows a Metonic cycle in which <b>intercalary</b> months are inserted on a set schedule. However, because the Burmese calendar has to adjust for the use of Indian-calendar-derived sidereal years with the Metonic cycle's tropical years, maintaining a set Metonic cycle has been a challenge.|$|E
25|$|According to some Christian and Karaite sources, the {{tradition}} in ancient Israel was that 1 Nisan would not start until the barley is ripe, being {{the test for}} the onset of spring. If the barley was not ripe, an <b>intercalary</b> month would be added before Nisan.|$|E
25|$|The Hebrew {{calendar}} is a lunar calendar synchronised {{with the}} seasons by intercalation, i.e. a lunisolar calendar. There are thus 12 ordinary months plus an extra month that is added in (intercalated) every few years. Some months vary in length by a day, as well. The months originally had very descriptive names, such as Ziv (meaning light) and Ethanim (meaning strong, perhaps {{in the sense of}} strong rain - i.e. monsoon), with Canaanite origins, but after the Babylonian captivity, the names were changed to the ones used by the Babylonians. With the Babylonian naming, the <b>intercalary</b> month has no special name of its own, and is merely referred to as Adar I, the following month being Adar/Adar II (in the Babylonian calendar, it was Adar II that was considered to be the <b>intercalary</b> month).|$|E
25|$|To {{bring the}} {{calendar}} into alignment with the seasons, he decreed that three extra months be inserted into 46BC (the ordinary <b>intercalary</b> {{month at the}} end of February, and two extra months after November). Thus, the Julian calendar opened on 1 January 45 BC. This calendar is almost identical to the current Western calendar.|$|E
25|$|According to Livy, {{the king}} of Rome Numa Pompilius (753-673 BC) {{inserted}} <b>intercalary</b> months {{in such a way}} that in the twentieth year the days should fall in with the same position of the sun from which they had started. As the twentieth year takes place nineteen years after the first year, this seems to indicate that the Metonic cycle was applied to Numa's calendar.|$|E
25|$|The Pontifex Maximus {{determined}} when an <b>intercalary</b> {{month was}} to be inserted. On average, this happened in alternate years. The system of aligning the year through <b>intercalary</b> months broke down at least twice: {{the first time was}} during and after the Second Punic War. It led to the reform of the 191 Acilian Law on Intercalation, the details of which are unclear, but it appears to have successfully regulated intercalation for over a century. The second breakdown {{was in the middle of}} the first century and may have been related to the increasingly chaotic and adversarial nature of Roman politics at the time. The position of Pontifex Maximus was not a full-time job; it was held by a member of the Roman elite, who would almost invariably be involved in the machinations of Roman politics. Because the term of office of elected Roman magistrates was defined in terms of a Roman calendar year, a Pontifex Maximus would have reason to lengthen a year in which he or his allies were in power or shorten a year in which his political opponents held office.|$|E
25|$|The cycle {{was used}} in the Babylonian {{calendar}}, ancient Chinese calendar systems (the 'Rule Cycle' 章) and the medieval computus (i.e. the calculation of the date of Easter). It regulates the 19-year cycle of <b>intercalary</b> months of the modern Hebrew calendar. The start of the Metonic cycle depends on which of these systems is being used; for Easter, {{the first year of the}} current Metonic cycle is 2014.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} the <b>intercalary</b> days is {{determined}} in advance {{to ensure that the}} year ends on the day before the next vernal equinox. This results in 4 or 5intercalary days being added. These days are inserted between the 18th and 19th months, falling around the end of February in the Gregorian calendar. The number of days added is unrelated to the timing of the Gregorian leap year.|$|E
25|$|Amphibians possess {{two types}} of glands, mucous and {{granular}} (serous). Both of these glands {{are part of the}} integument and thus considered cutaneous. Mucous and granular glands are both divided into three different sections which all connect to structure the gland as a whole. The three individual parts of the gland are the duct, the <b>intercalary</b> region, and lastly the alveolar gland (sac). Structurally, the duct is derived via keratinocytes and passes through {{to the surface of the}} epidermal or outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions of the body. The gland alveolus is a sac shaped structure which is found on the bottom or base region of the granular gland. The cells in this sac specialize in secretion. Between the alveolar gland and the duct is the <b>intercalary</b> system which can be summed up as a transitional region connecting the duct to the grand alveolar beneath the epidermal skin layer. In general, granular glands are larger in size than the mucous glands, however mucous glands hold a much greater majority in overall number.|$|E
25|$|To {{ensure that}} Passover {{did not start}} before spring, the {{tradition}} in ancient Israel held that {{the first day of}} Nisan would not start until the barley was ripe, being the test for the onset of spring. If the barley was not ripe, or various other phenomena indicated that spring was not yet imminent, an <b>intercalary</b> month (Adar II) would be added. However, since at least the 4th century, the date has been fixed mathematically.|$|E
25|$|The Passover {{begins on}} the 15th {{day of the}} month of Nisan, which {{typically}} falls in March or April of the Gregorian calendar. Passover is a spring festival, so the 15th day of Nisan typically begins {{on the night of}} a full moon after the northern vernal equinox. However, due to <b>intercalary</b> months or leap months falling after the vernal equinox, Passover sometimes starts on the second full moon after vernal equinox, as in 2016.|$|E
25|$|The ides {{occur on}} the thirteenth day in eight of the months, but in March, May, July, and October, they {{occur on the}} fifteenth. The nones always occur 8 days (one Roman week) before the ides, i.e., on the fifth or the seventh. The calends are always {{the first day of}} the month, and before Julius Caesar's reform fell sixteen days (two Roman weeks) after the ides (except the ides of February and the <b>intercalary</b> month).|$|E
25|$|The <b>intercalary</b> {{region of}} {{granular}} glands are more developed and mature {{in comparison with}} mucous glands. This region resides as a ring of cells surrounding the basal portion of the duct which are argued to have an ectodermal muscular nature due to their influence over the lumen (space inside the tube) of the duct with dilation and constriction functions during secretions. The cells are found radially around the duct and provide a distinct attachment site for muscle fibers around the gland's body.|$|E
25|$|In {{the typical}} form of her myth, Isis {{was the first}} {{daughter}} of Geb, god of the Earth, and Nut, goddess of the Sky, and she was {{born on the fourth}} <b>intercalary</b> day. She married her brother, Osiris, and she conceived Horus with him. Isis was instrumental in the resurrection of Osiris when he was murdered by Set. Using her magical skills, she restored his body to life after having gathered the body parts that had been strewn about the earth by Set.|$|E
25|$|According to Arakanese (Rakhine) tradition, the {{calendar}} was launched by King Thuriya Thehta of Dhanyawaddy Dynasty. At least {{down to the}} early 20th century, the Arakanese calendar used the Makaranta system although the Burmese calendar {{had moved to the}} Thandeikta system since the mid-19th century. In the Arakanese calendar, the month of Tagu gets the extra <b>intercalary</b> day in great leap years. Moreover, in Arakanese tradition, only the New Year's Day is observed. The Arakanese calendar under the name of Magi-San is still used by the Magh people of Bangladesh.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, Rome's legendary 10-month calendar notionally {{lasted for}} 304 days but was usually thought {{to make up}} the rest of the solar year during an unorganized winter period. The unattested but almost certain lunar year and the pre-Julian civil year were 354 or 355 days long, with the difference from the solar year more or less corrected by an irregular <b>intercalary</b> month. The Julian year was 365 days long, with a leap day doubled in length every fourth year, almost equivalent to the present Gregorian system.|$|E
25|$|In {{some very}} small insects, the venation may be greatly reduced. In chalcid wasps, for instance, only the subcosta {{and part of}} the radius are present. Conversely, an {{increase}} in venation may occur by the branching of existing veins to produce accessory veins or by the development of additional, <b>intercalary</b> veins between the original ones, as in the wings of Orthoptera (grasshoppers and crickets). Large numbers of cross-veins are present in some insects, and they may form a reticulum as in the wings of Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) and {{at the base of the}} forewings of Tettigonioidea and Acridoidea (katydids and grasshoppers, respectively).|$|E
25|$|The Hebrew lunar year {{is about}} eleven days {{shorter than the}} solar year and uses the 19-year Metonic cycle to bring it into line with the solar year, with the {{addition}} of an <b>intercalary</b> month every two or three years, for a total of seven times per 19 years. Even with this intercalation, the average Hebrew calendar year is longer by about 6 minutes and 40 seconds than the current mean tropical year, so that every 216 years the Hebrew calendar will fall a day behind the current mean tropical year; and about every 231 years it will fall a day behind the mean Gregorian calendar year.|$|E
25|$|Julius Caesar, {{following}} his victory in his {{civil war and}} {{in his role as}} pontifex maximus, ordered a reformation of the calendar in 46. This was undertaken by a group of scholars apparently including the Alexandrian Sosigenes and the Roman M. Flavius. Its main lines involved the insertion of ten additional days throughout the calendar and regular intercalation of a single leap day every fourth year in order to bring the Roman calendar into close agreement with the solar year. The year 46 was the last of the old system and included 3 <b>intercalary</b> months, the first inserted in February and two more— and —before the kalends of December.|$|E
25|$|The Hebrew {{calendar}} is a lunisolar calendar, {{meaning that}} months {{are based on}} lunar months, but years are based on solar years. The calendar year features twelve lunar months of twenty-nine or thirty days, with an <b>intercalary</b> lunar month added periodically to synchronize the twelve lunar cycles with the longer solar year. (These extra months are added seven times every nineteen years. See Leap months, below.) The beginning of each Jewish lunar month {{is based on the}} appearance of the new moon. Although originally the new lunar crescent had to be observed and certified by witnesses, the moment of the true new moon is now approximated arithmetically as the molad, which is the mean new moon to a precision of one part.|$|E
25|$|The {{prohibition}} of Nasī’ would presumably have been announced when the intercalated month {{had returned to}} its position just before the month of Nasi' began. If Nasī' meant intercalation, then the number and {{the position of the}} <b>intercalary</b> months between 1 AH and 10 AH are uncertain; Western calendar dates commonly cited for key events in early Islam such as the Hijra, the Battle of Badr, the Battle of Uhud and the Battle of the Trench, should be viewed with caution as they might be in error by one, two or even three lunar months. This prohibition was mentioned by Muhammad during the farewell sermon which was delivered on 9 Dhu al-Hijjah 10 AH (Julian date Friday 6 March, AD 632) on Mount Arafat during the farewell pilgrimage to Mecca.|$|E
25|$|The Coptic {{year is the}} {{extension}} of the ancient Egyptian civil year, retaining its subdivision into the three seasons, four months each. The three seasons are commemorated by special prayers in the Coptic Liturgy. This calendar is still in use all over Egypt by farmers {{to keep track of the}} various agricultural seasons. The Coptic calendar has 13 months, 12 of 30 days each and an <b>intercalary</b> month at the end of the year of 5 or 6 days, depending whether the year is a leap year or not. The year starts on 29 August in the Julian Calendar or on the 30th in the year before (Julian) Leap Years. The Coptic Leap Year follows the same rules as the Julian Calendar so that the extra month always has six days in the year before a Julian Leap Year.|$|E
