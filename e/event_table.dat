50|$|Rickardsson {{continued}} to win titles throughout the new century, although Mark Loram won the 2000 World Championship despite not winning a single event. Rickardsson won one - at Wrocław, but was too inconsistent {{to win the}} overall title. However, he again won the Elitserien, this time with his local team Masarna from Avesta, as he and team-mate Leigh Adams were the two highest averaging riders in the entire league. In 2001 he {{was back on the}} World stage, winning the World title with a record 121 points from six Grand Prix events, only missing one final - the last, at home on Stockholms Stadion, which was really academic as only a thirteenth place could possibly have robbed him of the title. He managed to win at home in the next Grand Prix series in 2002, which gave him three individual wins as he won his fifth World Championship. In 2003, he finished third overall. Thirteenth place finishes in Gothenburg, Bydgoszcz and Vikingskipet at Hamar ruining his bid for the title, and a concussion kept him out of the Swedish team that won the World Cup at Vojens (though he was part of a qualifier race and hence stands with a World Cup medal - his only title that year). The following year he managed to win the Swedish Championship at Målilla, but consistency eluded him as Jason Crump pipped him to the World title by three points (although the lead was 17 points before the final race). He followed this up with another extremely strong season in 2005. With 6 First positions at Wrocław (1st Event), Krško (3rd), Millennium Stadium (4th), Idrætsparken (5th) in Copenhagen, Prage (6th) and Lonigo (9th); a second in the Swedish event at Eskilstuna (2nd); third in the Scandinavian held in Målilla (7th) and a lowly 9th in the Polish Grand Prix held at Bydgoszcz (8th Event). Even with such a poor finish in Poland, however, he had already virtually sown up the Championship in the 7th Grand Prix in Målilla, ahead of Jason Crump. After the sixth event held in the Czech Republic, he was first in the points per <b>event</b> <b>table</b> of the Elitserien (the Swedish Domestic Elite League). Though Tony stated that he would give up racing after the 2006 season, he announced his early retirement from both World Championship and Domestic Speedway on 1 August 2006 at a press conference in Stockholm, in order to pursue his interest in racing cars instead.

30|$|Event {{reputation}} system (ERS): The event {{reputation system}} (ERS) prevents inaccurate traffic messages in VANETs. A dynamic reputation system {{is used to}} determine the incoming traffic trustworthiness to the driver. In this scheme, the vehicle gets enough reputation from inside sensors and received messages. When enough reputation is received, then the traffic warning will be broadcasting to other vehicles in the network. The scheme is dependent on two parameters: event reputation value and event confidence list. Event reputation system consists of three interfaces and four functionalities. One is <b>event</b> <b>table</b> storage for received messages or event from on-board unit sensors. The <b>event</b> <b>table</b> consists of event identity, type of event, time stamp of event, event location, event transmission range, event reputation value and event confidence value list. The <b>event</b> <b>table</b> stores each event separately and set event reputation value. The ERS uses aggregative event observation mechanism and reputation adoption mechanism. The event confidence threshold and event reputation threshold assess event intensity and reliability at the same time. The limitation of ERS is that event reputation value is low in high speed because of the sensor capability (minimum detection). The event confidence is small in low density. The other factors like event duration and transmission range also have an effect on ERS [84].|$|E
3000|$|... [...]) {{when the}} given ERS {{receives}} a traffic warning message from another vehicle, the ERS adds the event reputation {{value in the}} received message into the field of event reputation value at the same event record in the <b>event</b> <b>table</b> or creates a new event record in the <b>event</b> <b>table.</b> Event confidence value indicates the reliability extent of a traffic event and the value {{is the number of}} distinct vehicles whose messages, regarding to the same traffic event, have been received by the given vehicle's ERS. In addition, the definition of event confidence list is a string list of the identities of distinct vehicles which encounter the same traffic event. When a given vehicle encounters a traffic event and detects it, the given ERS will append its vehicle's identity into the event confidence list field at the corresponding event entry. Similarly, when a given vehicle receives a traffic warning message, the content of event confidence list in the message will be appended in the event confidence list field at the corresponding event entry. In an event record, event identity represents the identity of traffic event. Type of traffic event implies the predefined event type of this event. Occurrence timestamp and event location indicate the time and location when a traffic event is detected by a vehicle. Message transmission range represents the predefined transmission distance in hop count for the traffic warning message.|$|E

30|$|Lo and Tsai {{mentioned}} that some traffic safety applications actively send traffic revocation messages to inform other vehicles when an event is resolved. Therefore, {{in order to}} eliminate {{the weakness of the}} event message revocation scheme, the reputation value adaptation mechanism is introduced in ERS. In this mechanism, two functions to control the corresponding event reputation value of a detected event during the event’s life time are utilized so that the event status (resolved or not) is reflected by its reputation value. The first function is the reputation value suppression function which sets the event reputation value of an event record as the event reputation threshold if the reputation value of this event record is greater than the predefined reputation threshold. The reputation value suppression function helps ERS to control the maximum value of the reputation measurement. The second function is the reputation value degradation function which is used to decrease the event reputation value of an event record in the <b>event</b> <b>table</b> according to the length of event lifetime.|$|E
