50|$|Digital {{images are}} exposed onto true, light {{sensitive}} photographic paper with lasers and processed in photographic <b>developers</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixers.</b> These prints are true photographs and have continuous tone {{in the image}} detail. The archival quality of the print {{is as high as}} the manufacturer's rating for any given photo paper used. In large format prints, the greatest advantage is that, since no lens is used, there is no vignetting or detail distortion in the corners of the image.|$|E

Consumables for chest X-ray included <b>developer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixer</b> reagents (MYR 0.24 per X-ray film), envelop (MYR 0.26 per X-ray film), and X-ray film (MYR 1.65 per X-ray film).|$|R
50|$|A chemogram is {{a product}} of both {{photographic}} processing and painting on photographic paper. Unlike chemigrams the production process of chemograms consists of two different steps. First an enlarger is used to partly or fully process a photographic image onto photographic paper {{in the darkness of the}} darkroom. As soon as the preferred development of the image is reached, the photographic process is interrupted and the photographic paper is exposed to full light <b>and</b> treated with <b>developer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixer</b> (or other chemicals) like a chemigram. The procedure can be repeated until the chemogram is finished.|$|R
5000|$|A chemigram {{is made by}} {{painting}} with chemicals on photographic paper and lies within the general domain of experimentation in the visual arts. It {{requires the use of}} materials from silver halide-based photography (light-sensitive paper, <b>developer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixer),</b> {{but it is not a}} photograph. Like the photogram, the chemigram is made without a camera, yet it is created in full light instead of in the darkness of the darkroom. For this reason it is not [...] "light that writes" [...] (photo graphein in the Greek) but rather [...] "chemistry that writes".|$|R
50|$|Stop bath is a {{chemical}} bath usually used in processing traditional black-and-white photographic films, plates, and paper used after the material has finished developing. The {{purpose of the}} stop bath is to halt {{the development of the}} film, plate, or paper by either washing off the developing chemical or neutralizing it. With the former, a simple water rinse can be used between <b>developer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixer,</b> but the development process continues (though possibly at a very low level) for an indefinite and uncontrolled period of time during the rinsing.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to measure glutaraldehyde, acetic acid and sulfur dioxide and levels inside wet x-ray {{processing}} areas in a developing country and comparing data with those in developed countries. Forty-five radiographers from 10 educational hospitals affiliated to the Tehran University of Medical Sciences (TUMS) in Tehran, Iran participated in this descriptive-analytical study. Exposure to glutaraldehyde (a constituent of developer chemistry), acetic acid (a constituent of <b>fixer</b> chemistry) <b>and</b> sulfur dioxide (a byproduct of sulfites present in both <b>developer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixer</b> solutions) was measured in all participants as well as area exposure. Average full-shift exposure to glutaraldehyde, acetic acid and sulfur dioxide were 0. 0018, 2. 65 and 1. 64 mg m - 3, respectively. The results showed that the TUMS radiographers full-shift exposures are generally lower than the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) recommended levels. The concentration of glutaraldehyde collected by area sampling (darkroom) was almost five times (0. 0104 mg m - 3) greater than taken by personal sampling. Exposure to the chemical pollutants in the currents study were generally higher than in developed countries. Identification of these key exposure determinants is useful in targeting exposure evaluation and controls to reduce <b>developer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixer</b> chemicals exposures in the radiology departments. Employing of a digital imaging system that do not involve wet x-ray processing of photographic film would be a useful device for radiographers protection...|$|R
50|$|The {{camera is}} just {{large enough to}} contain a {{focusing}} screen and two trays of photographic chemicals; <b>developer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixer.</b> This mini darkroom/camera combo allows an image to be shot, on photographic paper, and processed within two minutes. Being able to judge the exposure by examining the negative is an important feature in a camera that has no shutter. The lenses usually came from an old enlarger and the exposure times are typically between 1 and 4 seconds. This means all photographs are taken {{with the cooperation of}} the subject who has to remain as still as possible during the exposure. As with many old photographic processes that had long exposure times, a kind of neck brace was employed to aid the subjects to remain still.|$|R
50|$|Johann Schulze is {{regarded}} as the first to obtain a chemigram-like image; in 1725, he produced such a work using opaque paper and a bottle of silver salts. Hippolyte Bayard produced another chemigram-like image during sensitization tests he conducted in 1839. In the 1930s and 1940s, the German Edmund Kesting and the French Maurice Tabard produced pictures by painting with <b>developer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixer</b> on photographic paper. It is the Belgian artist Pierre Cordier (born 1933), however, who has been most responsible for developing and exploring chemigrams. From his early days, in 1956, he was one of its rare practitioners, and contributed to its development by expanding its technical and esthetic possibilities. He adopted the name chimigramme in French in 1958 (chemigram in English and Dutch, Chemigramm in German, chimigramma in Italian, and quimigrama in Spanish and Portuguese), the most widely accepted designation today. In 1974 Josef H. Neumann advanced the process in his chemograms by incorporating optical elements before applying chemicals.|$|R

50|$|He {{participated in}} the {{controversy}} between socialist realism and formalism {{that took place in}} the German Democratic Republic, therefore his work was not realist and could not be shown in the country between 1949 and 1959. In 1955 he began to experiment with chemical painting, making photographs without the use of a camera and only with the use of chemical products such as the <b>developer</b> <b>and</b> the <b>fixer</b> <b>and</b> photographic paper, for which he made exposures to light using masks and templates. Between 1956 and 1967 he was a professor at the Academy of Cinema and Television of Potsdam.|$|R
5000|$|On November 10, 1956, {{writing a}} {{dedication}} with nail polish on photographic paper {{to a young}} German woman named Erika, Pierre Cordier discovered what he later called the chemigram. This technique, which [...] "combines the physics of painting (varnish, oil, wax) and the chemistry of photography (photosensitive emulsion, <b>developer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixer),</b> {{without the use of}} a camera or enlarger, and in full light", became for him a source of experiments and a plastic language. It opened up a new visual space at the boundaries of painting, photography, and writing, allowing him [...] "to create entrancing images impossible to realize by any other means. Working like a painter, he replaces the canvas with photographic paper." [...] Alongside his visual research, he continued in his career as a professional photographer, finally abandoning it in 1967. Several important figures in the arts became interested in these new visual possibilities, among them Otto Steinert (1915-1978), professor and founder of the Subjektive Fotografie movement. Thanks to his encouragement, Cordier produced many chemigrams as well as photographic self-portraits. These works were exhibited in 1958 during the Subjektive Fotografie 3 exhibition in Cologne.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims Bone {{density is}} {{frequently}} used in medical diagnosis and research. The current methods for determining bone density are expensive and not easily available in dental clinics. The {{aim of this}} study was to design and evaluate the accuracy of a digital method for hard tissue densitometry which could be applied on personal computers.   Materials and Methods: An aluminum step wedge was constructed. 50 E-speed Kodak films were exposed. Exposure time varied from 0. 05 s to 0. 5 s with 0. 05 s interval. Films were developed with automatic <b>developer</b> <b>and</b> <b>fixer</b> <b>and</b> digitized with 1240 U photo Epson scanner. Images were cropped at 10 × 10 mm size with Microsoft Office Picture Manager. By running the algorithm designed in MATLAB software, the mean pixel value of pictures was calculated.   Results: Finding of this study showed that by increasing the exposure time, the mean pixel value was decreased and at step 12, a significant discrimination was seen between the two subsequent times(P< 0. 001). By increasing the thickness of object, algorithm could define the density changes from step 4 in 0. 3 s and 5 in 0. 5 s, and it could determine the differences in the mean pixel value between the same steps of 0. 3 s and 0. 5 s from step 4.   Conclusion: By increasing the object thickness and exposure time, the accuracy of the algorithm for recognizing changes in density was increased. This software was able to determine the radiographic density changes of aluminum step wedge with at least 4 mm thickness at exposure time of 0. 3 s and 5 mm at 0. 5 s...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to verify the {{efficiency}} of an infection control protocol in dental radiology during radiographic exposure and processing, since the prevention of infectious diseases should be a matter of concern of the professional in all procedures. The areas selected for material collection were the film, tube head, dental chair, lead apron, buttons, protective barrier, darkroom bench <b>and</b> processing solutions (<b>developer</b> solution, water <b>and</b> <b>fixer</b> solution). Material was collected from each area both before and after establishment of the infection control protocol. Ten RODAC plates were employed for each site, adding up to 140 plates (70 before and 70 after), besides 60 Petri plates (30 before and 30 after) containing blood agar as the culture medium. The processing solutions were dropped on the Petri plates, whereas the material collected from the other areas was directly collected on the RODAC plates. All plates were incubated at 37 ºC for 48 hours and after this period the number of colonies in each plate was counted. The Wilcoxon test revealed statistically significant differences (p= 0. 002) between the results before and after establishment of the proposed infection control protocol.

40|$|Due to the {{unavoidable}} bugs {{appearing in}} {{the most of the}} software systems, bug resolution {{has become one of the}} most important activities in software maintenance. For large-scale software programs, developers usually depend on bug reports to fix the given bugs. When a new bug is reported, a triager has to complete two important tasks that include severity identification <b>and</b> <b>fixer</b> assignment. The purpose of severity identification is to decide how quickly the bug report should be addressed while fixer assignment means that the new bug needs to be assigned to an appropriate developer for fixing. However, a large number of bug reports submitted every day increase triagers' workload, thus leading to the reduction in the accuracy of severity identification <b>and</b> <b>fixer</b> assignment. Therefore it is necessary to develop an automatic approach to perform severity prediction <b>and</b> <b>fixer</b> recommendation instead of manual work. This article proposes a more accurate approach to accomplish the goal. We firstly utilize modified REP algorithm (i. e., REPtopic) and K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) classification to search the historical bug reports that are similar to a new bug. Next, we extract their features (e. g., assignees and similarity) to develop the severity prediction <b>and</b> <b>fixer</b> recommendation algorithms. Finally, by adopting the proposed algorithms, we achieve severity prediction <b>and</b> semi-automatic <b>fixer</b> recommendation on five popular open source projects, including GNU Compiler Collection (GCC), OpenOffice, Eclipse, NetBeans, and Mozilla. The results demonstrated that our method can improve the performance of severity prediction <b>and</b> <b>fixer</b> recommendation through comparison with the cutting-edge studies.

Due to the large number of <b>developers</b> <b>and</b> bug reports, it is hard to determine which developer (also called commenter) is able to comment on a particular bug report. We refer to the problem of recommending developers for commenting on bug reports as commenter recommendation. In this paper, we perform an empirical analysis on commenter recommendation based on five-year bug reports of four open source projects. First, we preliminarily analyze bug comments and commenters in three categories, the relationship between commenters <b>and</b> <b>fixers,</b> the data scale of comments, and the collaboration on bug commenting. Second, we design a recommendation approach via ranking developers in the crowd to reduce the manual effort of identifying commenters. In this approach, we formulize the commenter recommendation problem as a multi-label recommendation task <b>and</b> leverage both <b>developer</b> collaboration <b>and</b> bug content to find out appropriate commenters. Experimental results show that our approach can effectively recommend commenters; 41 % to 75 % of the recall value is achieved for top- 10 recommendation.
