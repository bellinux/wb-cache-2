This article reports on the results of a three-day <b>Deliberative</b> <b>Poll,</b> conducted before the June 2009 European Parliament elections, to evaluate the effects of deliberation on a representative sample of EU citizens. Findings show that, compared with a control group, deliberators changed their views significantly on immigration (becoming more liberal), climate change (becoming greener) and the EU itself (becoming more pro-European). Five different explanations of why deliberation appears to work are tested: sampling bias, increased political knowledge, discussion quality, small group social conformity pressure and the influence of other <b>Deliberative</b> <b>Poll</b> actors, but none is satisfactory.

50|$|The {{benefits}} of deliberation have been explored as a superior form of democracy. Initiatives like <b>Deliberative</b> <b>polling</b> or more broadly Deliberative democracy aim {{to harness the}} {{benefits of}} deliberation to produce better understanding and resolution of important issues. Citizens’ assemblies are {{intended to be a}} genuine public forum for deliberation, in which the participants cannot be easily captured by special interest. Scholars like James Fishkin, who spearheaded <b>deliberative</b> <b>polling,</b> claim that deliberation promotes better problem-solving by educating and actively engaging participants. It is believed the deliberation additionally removes faction by emphasizing resolution over partisanship.|$|E

50|$|In Australia, IDA {{is known}} for its use of <b>Deliberative</b> Opinion <b>Polling,</b> an {{approach}} to polling which incorporates focused small-group discussions conducted over a multi-day meeting and is considered by its theorists to provide a superior measure of informed public opinion than other forms of polling. Working with the Australian national and local governments, IDA has conducted four <b>deliberative</b> <b>polls</b> in Australia covering the topics of whether Australia should become a republic (1999), Reconciliation between indigenous and non-indigenous Australians (2001), the formation of a bill of rightsfor the Australian Capital Territory (2002) and parliamentary reform in South Australia (2003).

50|$|<b>Deliberative</b> <b>polling</b> {{requires}} those randomly sampled {{to gather}} {{at a single}} place to discuss the targeted issue(s).

40|$|In this paper, we {{analyze the}} participants' process of {{understanding}} and discussion in a <b>deliberative</b> <b>poll</b> that requires them to acquire {{a certain amount of}} scientific knowledge. Changes in the understanding and opinions of individuals are traced through transcripts of actual discussions and responses to questionnaires. This reveals, on the one hand, that people gain information not only through written documents, movies, and professional comments that answer their questions, but also through small-group discussions. It also shows that a small-group discussion helps participants, even those who do not talk much, to form their own opinions. On the other hand, our analysis shows that some parts of the small-group discussion proceeded with the participants having an improper or insufficient understanding of scientific contents involved in the discussion topics. This led us to believe that deliberation is not possible based on a single <b>deliberative</b> <b>poll</b> but rather on a series of <b>deliberative</b> <b>polls,</b> or other events that aim to induce deliberation...|$|R

50|$|The <b>Deliberative</b> Opinion <b>Poll,</b> {{sometimes}} called a <b>Deliberative</b> <b>Poll,</b> {{is a form}} of opinion poll that incorporates the principles of deliberative democracy. Professor James S. Fishkin of Stanford University first described the concept in 1988.The typical <b>deliberative</b> opinion <b>poll</b> takes a random, representative sample of citizens and engages them in deliberation on current issues or proposed policy changes through small-group discussions and conversations with competing experts to create more informed and reflective public opinion. A typical polling utilizes participants drawn from a random and representative sample to engage in small-group deliberations to create more informed and reflective public opinion.|$|R

50|$|Logistically, deliberative {{opinion polls}} {{are very similar}} to Danish {{consensus}} conferences. However, the Deliberative Poll is larger, from 100 to 200 participants, to increase representativeness. In addition, instead of reaching a consensus, agreement or verdict at the end of deliberation, <b>Deliberative</b> <b>Polling</b> is interested in measuring opinion change. The goal is to allow the researcher to infer what choices citizens would arrive at if they could undergo an extensive process of deliberation about an issue.|$|E

40|$|New {{research}} {{techniques have}} recently been developed to gather measures of public opinion that is better informed or more deliberative than that recorded in typical mass opinion surveys. These techniques include <b>deliberative</b> <b>polls,</b> educational surveys, and citizen planning cells. In view of what {{they set out to}} accomplish, what can we say from a scientific perspective about the utility of these methods? How are we to best interpret the data they produce? To address these questions, this paper reviews several of the most prominent and well-developed examples of <b>deliberative</b> or educational <b>polling.</b> We argue two main points. First, these new methods of assessing public opinion must be evaluated in terms of specific quality criteria that apply to different phases and/or participants in the democratic decision making process. Some techniques attempt to maximize several distinct qualities at once, making it difficult to identify specific objectives for evaluating success. Second, at least five important core methodological elements of educational or <b>deliberative</b> <b>polls</b> can be identified, each of which can theoretically alter results.

5000|$|Ackerman and Fishkin {{offer an}} example of a reform in their paper [...] "Deliberation Day." [...] The {{deliberation}} is to enhance public understanding of popular, complex, and controversial issues, through devices such as Fishkin’s <b>Deliberative</b> <b>Polling.</b> Although implementation of these reforms is unlikely in a large government situation such as the United States Federal Government. However, things similar to this have been implemented in small, local, governments like New England towns and villages. New England town hall meetings are a good example of deliberative democracy in a realistic setting.|$|E

5000|$|A claimed {{failure of}} most {{theories}} of deliberative democracy {{is that they}} do not address the problems of voting. James Fishkin's 1991 work, [...] "Democracy and Deliberation", introduced a way to apply the theory of deliberative democracy to real-world decision making, by way of what he calls the <b>deliberative</b> opinion <b>poll.</b> In the <b>deliberative</b> opinion <b>poll,</b> a statistically representative sample of the nation or a community is gathered to discuss an issue in conditions that further deliberation. The group is then polled, and the results of the poll and the actual deliberation can be used both as a recommending force and in certain circumstances, to replace a vote. Dozens of <b>deliberative</b> opinion <b>polls</b> have been conducted across the United States since his book was published.|$|R
50|$|Proponents of deliberative {{democracy}} {{believe that the}} ideal democracy allows individuals to participate equally in discussions. In Fishkin's vision of {{deliberative democracy}}, interest groups or parties do not dominate a discussion. Fishkin acknowledges difficulties in achieving mass participation: people view their opinions as statistically insignificant, and they are often uneducated about political topics and easily influenced by the media. In modern democracies, most citizens avoid discussing politics with people they disagree with, which limits the potential for conciliation and compromise. While the internet can provide a forum for deliberation and potentially change participation patterms, it may also increase political polarization. <b>Deliberative</b> <b>polling</b> may offer one means for political participation.|$|E
50|$|A key {{component}} of citizens’ assemblies is its deliberative nature. Deliberation allows {{for the education of}} participants, who formerly may be uninformed on the specific issue of interest. Citizens’ Assemblies typically provide access to experts on the matter, ranging from politicians to analysts to scientists. By incorporating the views, information and arguments of experts and then asking the participants to engage in collaborative discussion, citizens’ assemblies aim to educate the people selected, and ultimately, produce a vote or result representative the educated public interest. Deliberation allows for representation of the common person, while attempting to remove the issue of ignorance or apathy, which typically goes hand in hand. Similar initiatives like <b>Deliberative</b> <b>polling</b> attempt to utilize this benefits.|$|E
5000|$|Although the {{researchers}} {{claim to be}} interested in measuring change in public opinion instead of reaching an agreed verdict, [...] such method has been used as inputs into policy-making process. The researchers hold that seeking consensus produces social pressure that distorts the measurement of opinion. Hence confidential questionnaires provide a better basis for measuring considered judgment. Indeed, <b>deliberative</b> <b>polling</b> in Texas has led to the largest-ever investments by Texas in renewable energy, conservation subsidies for low-income consumers, and lower prices for customers buying renewable energy. More recently, Fishkin again claims that deliberation polling should be used in key policy issues like energy. Nonetheless, critics might say that results derived from such public meetings might not reflect lay audiences’ views, and using them [...] "as gauges of public reactions may produce policy choices that are diametrically opposed to public preferences." [...] Defenders of the Deliberative Poll would say that the process measures uninformed and disengaged opinion before deliberation and considered judgments when the public is more informed after deliberation. Public policymakers and the media get both from the Deliberative Poll and choose which they wish to listen to.|$|E
50|$|In addition, {{in spite}} of {{potentially}} balanced and structured public meetings, televised coverage critics might say that the discussions produce {{a situation in which}} the voices of the most vocal groups were amplified and the perceptions of majority opinions in turn did not reflect real opinion distributions. However, in the <b>Deliberative</b> <b>Poll</b> the opinions before and after deliberation are reported in confidential questions so perceptions of group discussion are not the basis for policy recommendations.|$|R
