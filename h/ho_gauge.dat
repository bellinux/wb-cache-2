5000|$|As [...] track scales down to 16.5mm at 1:64, modelers use <b>HO</b> <b>gauge</b> track (which {{represents}} Standard gauge at 1:87 scale) on Sn3½ layouts.|$|E
50|$|Bachmann {{produced}} an example in N and 00, 0 and 1 gauge. An <b>HO</b> <b>gauge</b> model {{was made to}} be used as the Thomas and Friends character Mavis.|$|E
5000|$|HOn30 (also called HOn2½, HO9 and H0e) gauge is the {{modelling}} of narrow-gauge railways in <b>HO</b> on N (...) <b>gauge</b> {{track in}} 1:87 scale ratio.|$|R
5000|$|Considerable {{confusion}} often {{arises when}} referring to [...] "scale" [...] and [...] "gauge", especially as the words are sometimes used interchangeably. The word [...] "scale" [...] refers to the proportional size of the model; the word [...] "gauge" [...] applies to the measurement between the inside faces of the rails. To highlight this difference, consider the various <b>gauges</b> used in <b>HO</b> scale; A <b>gauge</b> of 16.5 mm is used to represent the [...] "standard gauge" [...] of [...] (<b>HO</b> scale), a <b>gauge</b> of 12 mm is used to represent [...] gauge (HOm) and the [...] gauge (HOn3-1/2) and a gauge of 9 mm is used to represent a prototype gauge of [...] It is completely incorrect {{to refer to the}} mainstream scales as [...] "HO gauge", [...] "N gauge" [...] or [...] "Z gauge" ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{comprehensive}} {{narrow gauge}} On2 scale layout {{can be accomplished}} in {{the same amount of}} room as a standard <b>gauge</b> <b>HO</b> scale layout because [...] gauge prototypes are much smaller than their standard gauge equivalents - a South African [...] gauge NG G16 Garratt (2-6-2+2-6-2) is only 48' long whilst an Australian standard gauge NSWGR AD60 Class Garratt (4-8-4+4-8-4) is 108'.|$|R
50|$|The {{station of}} Wegscheid has been {{modelled}} in 1:87 (<b>HO</b> <b>gauge)</b> scale as at 1955 by the Passau Railway Society {{and may be}} viewed at Passaus main station, the Hauptbahnhof.|$|E

Furnished with {{reversible}} pointed Pin Hoes, Spring <b>Hoes,</b> Pressure or <b>gauge</b> wheel attachment, as desired that was available in 8 to 16 hoes. Featured a detachable grass seed attachment and New Adjustable Hitch. Advertised: [...] "Is the lightest running and easiest drill to operate ever put on the market." ...|$|R
50|$|In 1953 {{it started}} {{manufacturing}} a low budget and quite primitive model range. This gradually improved in detail {{by the late}} 1950s. By 1962 it was providing French, Belgian, Dutch and German models. Less than 10 years later, Lima {{was one of the}} largest model manufacturers in the world serving the modeling markets of the United States, Australia, Britain and South Africa. In 1977 the British model range switched from <b>HO</b> to 00 <b>gauge.</b>|$|R
50|$|OO {{describes}} {{models with}} {{a scale of}} 4 mm = 1 foot (1:76) running on HO scale 1:87 (3.5 mm = 1 foot) track (16.5 mm/0.650"). This combination came about as early clockwork mechanisms and electric motors were difficult to fit within HO scale models of British prototypes which are smaller than equivalent European and US locomotives. A quick and cheap solution was to enlarge {{the scale of the}} model to 4 mm to the foot but keep the 3.5 mm to the foot gauge track. This also allowed more space to model the external valve gear. The resulting <b>HO</b> track <b>gauge</b> of 16.5 mm represents 4 feet 1.5 inches at 4 mm to the foot scale, this is 7 inches under scale or is approximately 2.33 mm too narrow.|$|R
5000|$|In rail {{transport}} modelling, Sn3½ is a scale/gauge combination derived from S scale to represent narrow gauge [...] track by using [...] gauge track (the same as <b>HO</b> <b>gauge).</b> The scale is 1:64.|$|E
50|$|While Lionel {{thrived in}} the O Gauge market, American Flyer in the S gauge, and Bachmann in the <b>HO</b> <b>gauge,</b> Hornby thrived in the OO gauge since Lionels' OO gauge demand {{dropped in the}} 1940s and 1950s.|$|E
50|$|All gauges (scales) of {{trains are}} {{collected}} {{and operated by}} members. Partiality for gauge is a personal preference of a member. These include <b>HO</b> <b>gauge,</b> S gauge, O gauge/O scale, G gauge/G scale, Standard Gauge, 1 gauge, and 2 gauge.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Carstens Publications {{launched}} the successful On30 Annual, a special publication {{dedicated to the}} modeling of narrow gauge railways in O scale. This was followed up in 2009 {{with the establishment of}} the HOn3 Annual, which focuses on <b>HO</b> scale narrow <b>gauge</b> modeling. Both annuals are edited by Chris Lane. In 2010, the editors of Railfan & Railroad launched a special edition titled Great Railroad Photography, which was a showcase for innovative and creative photography both contemporary and vintage.|$|R
50|$|The modern {{standards}} for toy trains also include S <b>gauge,</b> <b>HO</b> scale, N scale, and Z scale, {{in descending order}} of size. HO and N scale {{are the most popular}} model railway standards of today; inexpensive sets sold in toy stores and catalogs are less realistic than those sold to hobbyists. O gauge arguably remains the most popular toy train standard. Another size that is attracting interest among hobbyists is building and operating trains from Lego, or L gauge, which is roughly 1/38 scale.|$|R
50|$|The 4F {{has been}} {{modelled}} by Lima (O, OO, <b>HO</b> and N <b>Gauge)</b> and Graham Farish (N Gauge, still produced under the Bachmann label). Airfix produced a tender drive {{model of the}} 4F in OO Gauge in 1978. Production of this was continued by Dapol after it acquired Airfix models in 1985, and were subsequently sold to Hornby in the late 1990s. They upgraded the model to loco drive in 2012. Bachmann have produced {{a version of the}} Midland railway variant of the 4F since 2012.|$|R
50|$|Penn Line's early {{contribution}} to model railroading {{was the use}} of printer's lead to cast the locomotives. This allowed very fine detail in the castings, much greater detail than could be achieved from stampings. And while the larger O gauge and S gauge had the potential for more detail, Penn Line's founders chose to use the smaller <b>HO</b> <b>gauge.</b> Their thinking was that the potential for realism coming from more elaborate layouts made HO the best compromise. This was at a time when <b>HO</b> <b>gauge</b> was far from the standard it is today. Penn Line produced about a half dozen different locomotives based on prototypes from the Pennsylvania Railroad, hence the choice of the company name Penn Line.|$|E
50|$|Lady Lake Historical Society Museum is a {{local history}} museum in Lady Lake, Lake County, Florida. Exhibits include citrus {{industry}} artifacts, a miniature <b>HO</b> <b>gauge</b> railroad, furniture, tools, photographs, and memorabilia. The museum is located behind a log cabin on Lady Lake Boulevard.|$|E
5000|$|Sometimes, {{kitbashing}} {{has been}} used to create [...] "art" [...] per se. The Toronto sculptor Kim Adams has used <b>HO</b> <b>gauge</b> freight cars, containers, detail parts, figures and scenery to create artistic landscapes. American artist Kris Kuksi also uses kitbashing to detail his maximalist sculptures.|$|E
5000|$|On30 (also called On2, O16.5 and Oe) gauge is the {{modelling}} {{of narrow}} gauge railways in O scale on <b>HO</b> (...) <b>gauge</b> track in 1:48 scale ratio by American model railroaders, in 1:43.5 scale ratio by British and French model railroaders and 1:45 by Continental European model railroaders (excluding France).|$|E
50|$|This shows all {{the scales}} that Lionel has been {{associated}} with for over 100 years total. The ones that are highlighted in italic lettering are the ones that Lionel no longer makes today. Today Lionel makes O Gauge, O Scale, G Gauge, S Gauge, S Scale, <b>HO</b> <b>Gauge,</b> and HO Scale.|$|E
50|$|The most {{recognisable}} {{building in}} Lusigny, throughout France (and abroad), is undoubtedly its railway station. Reproduced in miniature {{by the firm}} Jouef (maker of <b>HO</b> <b>gauge</b> electric trains, now a subsidiary of Hornby), the building gave hours of happiness to several generations of French children. The station was closed by the SNCF in the 1990s.|$|E
50|$|While {{the system}} was {{generally}} confined to the larger gauges (O gauge and above) the Märklin company has for many years used {{a version of the}} system (known as the Märklin system) for their <b>HO</b> <b>gauge</b> range. Peco Products make studding for their 00/H0 track range. Part nos SL-17 for track and SL-18 for turnouts.|$|E
5000|$|On30 {{uses the}} American O scale of 1/4" [...] to the foot, (ratio 1:48) to operate trains on <b>HO</b> <b>gauge</b> (...) track. The 30 {{indicates}} the scale/gauge combination {{is used to}} model [...] narrow gauge prototypes, although it {{is often used to}} model [...] and [...] gauge prototypes as well. This scale/gauge combination is sometimes referred to as On2.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States {{modelling}} in On30 {{dates back}} to the 1950s, using <b>HO</b> <b>gauge</b> wheels and locomotive chassis. The scale was popularised to some extent in the 1960s and 1970s by the writings of modellers such as Gordon North. An On30 layout, the Venago Valley (built by Bill Livingston) was featured in the June 1971 issue of Railroad Model Craftsman magazine. However, as there are very few prototype [...] gauge railways in the United States, it remained very much a minority modelling area, especially when compared with modelling in On2 and On3.|$|E
