5|$|Fukuda's {{training}} method consisted mostly {{of the student}} taking fall after <b>fall</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> teacher or senior student until he began to understand {{the mechanics of the}} technique. Fukuda stressed applied technique over ritual form. He gave beginners a short description of the technique and had them engage in free practice (randori) in order to teach through experience. It was only after the student had attained some proficiency that he taught them traditional forms (kata). This method was difficult, as there were no special mats for falling, only the standard straw mats (tatami) laid over wooden floors.|$|E
5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{part of the}} operation was over by 02:15. The intruders had spent over an hour in British airspace. Now the journey back over the sea to Germany and the Netherlands was undertaken. The British had jammed German radio beacons and switched on others with the same frequency. It was hoped the move would fool German pilots into landing in Britain in error. Experienced pilots did not <b>fall</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> ruse. Still, they had to fly over the sea by dead reckoning. A consequence of this showed that while around only five Ju 88s were lost in combat over England, eight crews were missing, three were killed in crash-landings and had died from their injuries, six crews had baled out 11 aircraft crashed or were damaged on landing.|$|E

Dion first approached Montreal MPs Denis Coderre and Pablo Rodriguez to succeed Proulx, but they declined. That evening he named Senator Céline Hervieux-Payette to the vacant post. While the Party was divided {{on whether or not}} the government should be toppled on a confidence vote regarding the Throne Speech, Dion mentioned in a statement in the House of Commons on 17 October that the Liberals will support the Throne Speech but with major amendments including the Kyoto Protocol and the end of mission in Afghanistan by 2009 and had criticized the government on several aspects including the economy, seniors and child poverty, the crime policy, the Senate reform. The latter amendment proposal was rejected by the New Democratic Party who are favouring an immediate end to the mission. Dion explained the decision as that Canadians are not willing to have a third election in just over three years. All Liberal members abstained from voting on the Throne Speech on 24 October 2007, which passed 126–79.|$|E
25|$|In 1996, Zbyszko was {{promoted}} to the WCW Monday Nitro broadcast team, where he announced during the first hour with Tony Schiavone. In 1997, he was antagonized by New World Order (nWo) member Scott Hall, but Hall opted not to face Zbyszko. Zbyszko remained in the broadcast booth for most of 1997, occasionally refereeing matches involving Hall and the nWo. On October 13, 1997, Zybyszko got involved in a WCW Tag Team Championship match between the Steiner Brothers and Scott Hall and Syxx (subbing for an injured Kevin Nash) and counted the ensuing <b>fall</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Steiner Brothers who became the champions. This reign was official despite Zybyszko not being an official referee, a role he previously played in Scott Hall's match against Lex Luger at Fall Brawl. On December 28, 1997 at StarrCade 1997, Zbyszko returned to the ring for a match against Bischoff for control of WCW Monday Nitro with Bret Hart acting as special referee. Hart ensured that the nWo did not interfere, and Zbyszko won the match, regaining control of Nitro for WCW. He continued to feud with Hall and his lackey, Louie Spicolli, culminating in a match between Zbyszko and Hall at Souled Out 1998 on January 24, 1998. Zbyszko won the match by disqualification after Dusty Rhodes betrayed him, joining the nWo.|$|E

500|$|Jezebel {{determined}} that Belle [...] "is often {{held up as}} the standard of the 'feminist' Disney princess." [...] According to Tales, Then and Now: More Folktales as Literary Fictions for Young Adults author Anna E. Altmann, Disney heavily promoted Beauty and the Beast as [...] "a feminist fairy tale" [...] due to Belle's characterization and role in the film. In his book Hearing a Film, Seeing a Sermon: Preaching and Popular Movies, author Timothy B. Cargal agreed that the character indicated [...] "Disney's ... continued efforts to reshape their heroines for a more feminist age." [...] According to Girl Culture: An Encyclopedia author Claudia Mitchell, Belle's feminism was influenced by third-wave feminism and the relatively new concept of girl power during the 1990s. Feminist critics have been generally mixed in their analyses of Belle, arguing {{over whether or not}} the character is in fact [...] "feminist enough." [...] Although Beauty and the Beast was initially lauded upon release for starring a [...] "forward thinking and feminist" [...] heroine, critics tend to agree that, in spite of Belle's independence and resentment towards Gaston, Beauty and the Beast essentially remains a romance about a girl who finally [...] "meets her ideal man." [...] Acknowledging that Belle [...] "represented significant change from [...] sweet, mop-wielding predecessors," [...] Twilight and History author Nancy Reagin observed that [...] "the end result of fulfillment through marriage has been maintained." [...] Kathleen Maher of The Austin Chronicle cited Belle as an example of [...] "pseudo-feminism" [...] because she rejects one man, Gaston, in favor of another, a prince. While commending Belle for [...] "seeing past the beast's appearance," [...] Judith Welikala of The Independent in the end accused the character of [...] "melting back into the role of wife when he turns back into a handsome prince." [...] Fairy Tale author Andrew Teverson referred to Belle as Disney's attempt to address [...] "feminist criticism of its representation of women in earlier films," [...] but ultimately criticized the character's curiosity for [...] "extend only to romance," [...] additionally accusing her of being [...] "a zealous individualist with a pathological hostility to common men and women." [...] Meanwhile, Stylist ranked Belle among the most feminist Disney characters, describing her as an [...] "incredibly intelligent" [...] woman who [...] "doesn't stand for a man who considers her as just a piece of meat ... she wants someone who loves her for her mind too." [...] Acknowledging the character's [...] "feminist longings," [...] Daniel Eagen, author of America's Film Legacy: The Authoritative Guide to the Landmark Movies in the National Film Registry, cited Belle as Disney's [...] "modern-day corrective to Snow White." [...] Beyond Adaptation: Essays on Radical Transformations of Original Works author Phyllis Frus wrote that, initially, Beauty and the Beast does not seem [...] "remotely feminist." [...] However, the author did acknowledge Belle as [...] "an appealing character with a noticeable feminist streak," [...] but in the end criticized Disney's Consumer Products of reversing what the film had nearly accomplished by inducting the character into the Disney Princess franchise. In Refinery29's [...] "Definitive Ranking Of Disney Princesses As Feminist Role Models," [...] author Vanessa Golembewski ranked the character eighth but described her personality and ambitions as [...] "confusing." [...] Complex's Tara Aquino described Belle as [...] "a kinda feminist ... who's well-read, self-sufficient, and with standards high enough that she doesn't <b>fall</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> town's brain-dead pretty boy." ...|$|E

Shortly thereafter, Edwin Pearce Christy founded Christy's Minstrels, combining the refined singing of the Ethiopian Serenaders (epitomized {{by the work of}} Christy's composer Stephen Foster) with the Virginia Minstrels' bawdy schtick.
