5|$|Antiparasitic {{treatment}} {{is most effective}} early {{in the course of}} infection, but <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> cases in the acute phase. Drugs of choice include azole or nitro derivatives, such as benznidazole or nifurtimox. Both agents are limited in their capacity to completely eliminate T. cruzi from the body (parasitologic cure), especially in chronically infected patients, and resistance to these drugs has been reported.|$|E
5|$|In 2013 about 3.3 {{million cases}} of self-harm occurred. Self-harm is most common {{between the ages}} of 12 and 24. Self-harm in {{childhood}} is relatively rare but the rate has been increasing since the 1980s. However, self-harm behaviour can occur at any age, including in the elderly population. The risk of serious injury and suicide is higher in older people who self-harm. Self-harm <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> humans. Captive animals, such as birds and monkeys, are also known to participate in self-harming behaviour.|$|E

What government is to be regarded here as representative of a foreign sovereign state is a political rather than a judicial question, and is to be determined by the political department of the government. That authority <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> a determination of the government to be recognized. It includes the power to determine the policy which is to govern the question of recognition. Objections to the underlying policy as well as objections to recognition are to be addressed to the political department and not to the courts.|$|E
5|$|Trace fossils consist {{mainly of}} tracks and burrows, but also include coprolites (fossil feces) and marks left by feeding. Trace fossils are {{particularly}} significant because {{they represent a}} data source that <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> animals with easily fossilised hard parts, and they reflect organisms' behaviours. Also many traces date from significantly earlier than the body fossils of animals that {{are thought to have}} been capable of making them. Whilst exact assignment of trace fossils to their makers is generally impossible, traces may for example provide the earliest physical evidence of the appearance of moderately complex animals (comparable to earthworms).|$|E

5|$|Agricultural runoff {{containing}} {{pesticide residues}} {{has also been}} concentrated in the lower river in greater amounts. Toxins derived from pesticides have led to fish kills; six of these events were recorded between 1964 and 1968 alone. The pesticide issue is even greater in streams and water bodies near agricultural lands irrigated by the Imperial Irrigation District with Colorado River water. In the Imperial Valley, Colorado River water used for irrigation overflows into the New and Alamo rivers and into the Salton Sea. Both rivers and the sea {{are among the most}} polluted bodies of water in the United States, posing dangers not only to aquatic life but to contact by humans and migrating birds. Pollution from agricultural runoff <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> the lower river; the issue is also significant in upstream reaches such as Colorado's Grand Valley, also a major center of irrigated agriculture.|$|E
5|$|Amongst the Hispanic {{pioneers in}} the Coast Guard were the Andreu family of Florida; Joseph Ximenez, the first Hispanic-American to command a Coast Guard vessel; and Detlef Frederick Argentine de Otte, the first Hispanic to {{graduate}} from Revenue Cutter Service School of Instruction. The Coast Guard can {{be transferred to the}} Department of the Navy by the President or Congress during time of war. During World War I, Hispanics served in the United States Revenue Cutter Service and U.S. Life-Saving Service; and during World War II, Hispanics served aboard ships guarding the shores of the United States and the Atlantic Ocean against enemy submarines. However some men, such as Jose R. Zaragoza, served on missions on lonely atolls. Hispanics have served in every major conflict, and continue to do so. Coast guard service <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> armed conflicts with other nations; the Coast Guard also plays a vital role in the apprehension of illegal immigrants and drug smugglers.|$|E
5|$|An ala or hala (plural: ale or hali) is {{a female}} mythological {{creature}} {{recorded in the}} folklore of Bulgarians, Macedonians, and Serbs. Ale are considered demons of bad weather whose main purpose is to lead hail-producing thunderclouds {{in the direction of}} fields, vineyards, or orchards to destroy the crops, or loot and take them away. Extremely voracious, ale particularly like to eat children, though their gluttony <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> Earth. It is believed they sometimes try devouring the Sun or the Moon, causing eclipses, and that it would mean {{the end of the world}} should they succeed. When people encounter an ala, their mental or physical health, or even life, are in peril; however, her favor can be gained by approaching her with respect and trust. Being in a good relationship with an ala is very beneficial, because she makes her favorites rich and saves their lives in times of trouble.|$|E

5|$|De Lucía {{was widely}} {{considered}} to be the world's premier flamenco guitarist and by many to be Spain's greatest musical export. He had a revolutionary influence on flamenco music both as a composer and otherwise. His influence on flamenco guitar has been compared with that of Andrés Segovia's on classical guitar. His album Fuente y Caudal (Fountain and Flow) has been cited by many to have changed the world of flamenco guitar beyond traditional flamenco culture. Along with Enrique Morente and Camarón de la Isla, de Lucía was the first artist to break away from traditional flamenco and form what is now known as nuevo flamenco. As a composer, de Lucía was the first Spanish artist to mix jazz with Andalusian music in a more or less systematic way. This includes, but <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to,</b> his collaborations with Di Meola, McLaughlin, and Pedro Iturralde.|$|E
5|$|The Bader International Study Centre (BISC) {{is housed}} in Herstmonceux Castle, East Sussex, England, which was donated to Queen's in 1993 by alumnus Alfred Bader. BISC is academically fully {{integrated}} with Queen's, although financially self-sufficient. Its mission is to provide academic programs for undergraduate students whose academic interests are oriented toward the United Kingdom, Europe and the European Union, continuing-education programs for executives and other professional or “special interest” groups, a venue for conferences and meetings, a base for international graduate students and other scholars undertaking research in the United Kingdom and Europe and as an enhanced educational, social and cultural environment for the local community, using the unique heritage of the castle. The opportunity to study at the BISC <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> Queen's students. Queen's has academic exchange agreements with Canadian and foreign universities.|$|E
5|$|The regular {{gameplay}} {{features a}} third-person perspective, where players hold the Wii Remote horizontally. Samus can jump, fire the arm cannon, and {{turn into a}} morph ball, which can roll into narrow passages and drop energy bombs. While gameplay is similar to early Metroid titles, the game's environments are three-dimensional and movement <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> a two-dimensional plane. When the Wii Remote is pointed towards the screen, the angle switches into a first-person perspective, where players can lock onto targets and fire missiles; however, players cannot move in this perspective. There are several instances where players will have to constantly switch between play modes; for example, fighting off a horde of flying enemies in third person, while switching to first person to destroy their spawn points. Additionally, the first-person mode is also used in exploration, such as locating hidden items.|$|E

5|$|There {{are many}} accents that are {{traditionally}} {{thought of as}} London accents. The most well known of the London accents long ago acquired the Cockney label, which is heard both in London itself, and across the wider South East England region more generally. The accent of a 21st-century Londoner varies widely; what {{is becoming more and}} more common amongst the under-30s however is some fusion of Cockney with a whole array of ethnic accents, in particular Caribbean, which form an accent labelled Multicultural London English (MLE). The other widely heard and spoken accent is RP (Received Pronunciation) in various forms, which can often be heard in the media and many of other traditional professions and beyond, although this accent <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> London and South East England, and can also be heard selectively throughout the whole UK amongst certain social groupings.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{is based}} on the {{severity}} of the bite; the majority of cases do not require medical care and patients with localised pain, swelling and redness usually only require local application of ice and routine analgesics. Hospital assessment is recommended if simple analgesia does not resolve local pain or clinical features of systemic envenoming occur. In more severe bites, Redback antivenom can be given. Redback antivenom can also cross-neutralise katipo venom, and it is used to treat envenoming from Latrodectus katipo in New Zealand. It is available from most major New Zealand hospitals. Antivenom will usually relieve symptoms of systemic envenoming and is indicated in anyone suffering symptoms consistent with Latrodectus envenoming. Unlike some other antivenoms, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>limited</b> <b>to</b> patients with signs of severe, systemic envenoming. Particular indications for using antivenom are local then generalised pain, sweating or hypertension. However, good evidence to support the effectiveness of widow spider antivenoms is lacking and studies have cast some doubt on antivenoms efficacy in latrodectism. Pain relief agents, such as parenteral opiates, or benzodiazepines may be required as adjunct agents.|$|E
