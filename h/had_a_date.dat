5|$|Sinclair sends Lothar to Cliff and Peevy's home to {{find the}} rocket pack. The FBI arrives, but Cliff and Peevy escape, while Lothar steals its {{detailed}} schematics drawn up by Peevy. Later, at the airfield diner, Cliff and Peevy are trapped by several Valentine mobsters; they learn that Jenny <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> with Sinclair, and of the actor's involvement {{in the hunt for}} the rocket pack. The diner patrons overpower the gangsters, while a bullet ricochet punctures the rocket's fuel tank, which Peevy temporarily patches with Cliff's chewing gum. Cliff proceeds to the South Seas Club, where he tells Jenny about his new alter ego. The Valentine gang arrives, and Jenny is kidnapped by Sinclair in the ensuing melée.|$|E
25|$|There {{are various}} {{theories}} {{about the origins of}} the Piraeus Athena. Because the room the statue was found in was very close to the main harbor, many scholars believe that the statue had been stored in a harbor’s stoa and were just about to be shipped. Additionally, the Piraeus Athena and other statues were not in random order but seemed to be packed. A coin found near the statues <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>date</b> equivalent to 87/86 BC on it, along with a picture of King Mithridates VI. Because it is known that Piraeus was captured by Sulla in 86 BC, many have further speculated two theories. One theory is that the statues were going to be shipped in order to save them from the Roman attack. The second theory is that the statues were being shipped by the Romans to Italy as part of their spoils. It is thought that the statue may have originally come from the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira in Piraeus. This is because the peplos in the statue is similar to the drapery of the peplos in the statue of Eirene by Cephisodotus the Elder, who was also known to have made a statue of Athena that resided in the sanctuary of Zeus Soter and Athena Soteira. Other scholars believe that the statue may have come from Delos, since three of the statues found with the Piraeus Athena were of Artemis, and Delos was considered the birthplace of Artemis. Additionally, the Romans had captured Delos in 88 BC and therefore the statues could {{have been part of the}} scared funds Mithradates’ general had sent to Delos. Due to the dating, it has been estimated that the Piraeus Athena probably dates back to 360-340 BCE.|$|E

500|$|Cyrus {{contacted}} Chris Applebaum {{to direct}} the accompanying music video for [...] "Party in the U.S.A.", with ideologies for the video already conceived.

In the scene, Travolta exits from a car and walks over to a jungle gym, where he sits on a swing and performs the song as projections are displayed in the background. To render homage to her parents' courting days, Cyrus and Applebaum named a drive-in theater in the video Corral Drive-In after a Kentucky drive-in where Cyrus' parents <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>date.</b> [...] "In addition, Miley's mom Tish used to drive '79 black Pontiac Trans Am, Smokey and the Bandit (1977) style, and obviously that's the car that Miley arrives in," [...] Applebaum said.|$|E
