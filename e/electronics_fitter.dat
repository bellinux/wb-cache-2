40|$|This paper {{describes}} a CMOS-compatible self-testable uncooled InfraRed (IR) imager {{that can be}} used in multiple applications such as overheating detection, night vision, and earth tracking for satellite positioning. The imager consists of an array of thermal pixels that sense an infrared radiation. Each pixel is implemented as a front-side bulk micromachined membrane suspended by four arms, each arm containing a thermopile made of Poly/Al thermocouples. The imager has a pixel self-test function that can be activated off-line in the field for validation and maintenance purposes, with an on-chip test signal generation that requires only slight modifications in the pixel design. The self-test of a pixel takes about 15 ms. The area overhead required by the test electronics does not imply any reduction of the pixel fill factor, since the <b>electronics</b> <b>fits</b> in the pixel silicon boundary. However, the additional self-test circuitry contributes to a small increase in the thermal conductance of a pixel due to the wiring of a heating resistor over the suspended arms. The self-test capability of the imager allows for a production test with a standard test equipment, without the need of special infrared sources and the associated optical equipment. A prototype with 8 * 8 pixels is currently in fabrication for validation of the self-test approach. In this prototype, each pixel occupies an area of 200 * 200 mu m/sup 2 /, with a membrane size of 90 * 90 mu m/sup 2 / (fill factor of 0. 2). Simulation results indicate a pixel thermal conductance of 22. 6 mu W/K, giving a responsivity of 138 V/W, with a thermocouple Seebeck coefficient that has been measured at 248 mu V/K for the 0. 6 mu m CMOS technology used. The noise equivalent power (considering only Johnson noise in the thermopile) is calculated as 0. 18 nW. H/sup - 1 / 2 / with a detectivity of 5. 03 * 10 /sup 7 / cm. Hz/sup 1 / 2 / W/sup - 1 / in line with current state-of-the-art.

InPhase was spun out from Bell Labs in 2000 after recruiting two storage industry veterans, Steve Kitrosser (Digital Equipment Corporation, Maxtor, Maxoptics, Quinta, and Seagate) joined as Chairman, and Nelson Diaz (Digital Equipment Corporation, Seagate, StorageTek), with very strong operating experience, in particular high volume magnetic disk drive and tape drive manufacturing with very high quality. Their technology promised multiple terabyte storage. InPhase concentrated on applied research from 2001 to 2004 {{to understand what}} issues had to be addressed and solved {{in order to be}} able to deliver high volume storage media and drives with high reliability and high manufacturing yield. During this time frame, Stephen Socolof joined the Board of Directors representing New Venture Partners, and in late 2004 pushed the Inphase management team to get a product (a working disk drive and storage media) within one year; a number of the InPhase staff were surprised by this, and wrote a white paper explaining that the staff had tens of decades of experience in bringing digital storage products to market, and that based on where InPhase was at in product development in early 2005, it would require three to five years of additional engineering effort, in particular in manufacturing processes for storage media and drives, before InPhase could commence to sell prototype product to customers. This warning was ignored, and the Chairman and Chief Executive Officer said they would try to get a product out in a year, without telling any other investors. Nelson Diaz asked Demetri Lignos for a product plan, and Demetri responded with a rack mounted drive that would allow all the optics and light transmission to lie in a single two dimensional plane, enormously simplifying the manufacturing of such a product; Nelson Diaz rejected this because he had been told that StorageTek, his former employer, had a library that held five and a quarter inch form factor drives (in fact there is no such thing as a specification for a five and a quarter inch disk drive), but Demetri Lignos and his team attempted to develop a disk drive product plan that would fit into a StorageTek library and were NOT able to make all the optics and <b>electronics</b> <b>fit,</b> even thought light was following paths in THREE dimensions to complicate manufacturing, and the total length of the drive was twenty six inches). With this as prolog, Demetri Lignos elected to retire from InPhase (after having brought many digital storage products to market from raw technology), and surprise surprise, at the end of 2005, InPhase received additional funding led by New Venture Partners to get a product out within a year, having failed to do so in 2005. At the end of 2006, InPhase received additional funding led by New Venture Partners to get a product out within a year, having failed to do sin 2006. At the end of 2007, InPhase received additional funding led by New Venture Partners to get a product out within a year, having failed to do so in 2007. In April 2008 InPhase was scheduled to have a product launch at the National Association of Broadcasters (NAB) trade show in Las Vegas, NV, and at the show in the middle of the launch InPhase announced it did not have a viable product to sell to customers. In 2008 Stephen Socolof elected to shop InPhase and its extensive patent portfolio, but to no avail, and in 2009-2010 went through a financial restructuring resulting in Steve Socolof leaving the Board and all of the New Venture Partners preferred stock was purchased by Signal Lake.|$|R
40|$|Active and {{adaptive}} wavefront control {{can be useful}} on space platforms {{for a variety of}} observation applications. For example, to achieve high contrast imaging to a level of 1 e- 10 with a coronagraph (required to image an Earth- like planet around a Sun-like star), space telescopes require high spatial frequency wavefront control systems. To achieve intersatellite links through the atmosphere, wavefront correction is needed to counter the effects of atmospheric turbulence and scintillation. For deployable apertures, active correction is desired to properly align and calibrate optical systems. Deformable mirrors (DMs) are a key element of a wavefront control system, as they correct for imperfections, thermal distortions, and diffraction that would otherwise corrupt the wavefront and ruin the measurement. High-actuator count mirrors are required to achieve the desired level of correction on space telescopes, but this key technology lacks spaceflight heritage. The goal of the CubeSat Deformable Mirror (DeMi) technology demonstration mission is to characterize a microelectromechanical system (MEMS) deformable mirror and to demonstrate its ability to perform modest wavefront correction on a nanosatellite platform. DeMi is a 6 U CubeSat that houses a 2 U optical payload.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project {{was to develop a}} compact, modular {{multi-channel}} x-ray detector with integrated electronics. This detector, based upon emerging silicon drift detector (SDD) technology, will be capable of high data rate operation superior to {{the current state of the}} art offered by high purity germanium (HPGe) detectors, without the need for liquid nitrogen. In addition, by integrating the processing electronics inside the detector housing, the detector performance will be much less affected by the typically noisy electrical environment of a synchrotron hutch, and will also be much more compact than current systems, which can include a detector involving a large LN 2 dewar and multiple racks of electronics. The combined detector/processor system is designed to match or exceed the performance and features of currently available detector systems, at a lower cost and with more ease of use due to the small size of the detector. In addition, the detector system is designed to be modular, so a small system might just have one detector module, while a larger system can have many â you can start with one detector module, and add more as needs grow and budget allows. The modular nature also serves to simplify repair. In large part, we were successful in achieving our goals. We did develop a very high performance, large area multi-channel SDD detector, packaged with all associated electronics, which is easy to use and requires minimal external support (a simple power supply module and a closed-loop water cooling system). However, we did fall short of some of our stated goals. We had intended to base the detector on modular, large-area detectors from Ketek GmbH in Munich, Germany; however, these were not available in a suitable time frame for this project, so we worked instead with pnDetector GmbH (also located in Munich). They were able to provide a front-end detector module with six 100 m^ 2 SDD detectors (two monolithic arrays of three elements each) along with associated preamplifiers; these detectors surpassed the performance we expected to get from the Ketek detectors, however they are housed in a sealed module, which does not offer the ease of repair and expandability weâd hoped to achieve with the Ketek SDDâs. Our packaging efforts were quite successful, as we came up with a very compact way to mount the detector and to house the associated electronics, as well as a very effective way to reliably take out the heat (from the electronics as well as the detectorâs Peltier coolers) without risk of condensation and without external airflow or vibration, which could create problems for the target applications. While we were able to design compact processing <b>electronics</b> that <b>fit</b> into the detector assembly, they are still at the prototype stage, and would require a significant redesign to achieve product status. We have not yet tested this detector at a synchrotron facility; we do still plan on working with some close contacts at the nearby Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Laboratory (SSRL) to get some testing with the beam (using existing commercial electronics for readout, as the integrated processor is not ready for use) ...|$|R
