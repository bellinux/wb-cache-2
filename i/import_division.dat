40|$|Post-translational {{modification}} of proteins {{by the addition}} of methyl groups to the side chains of Lys and Arg residues is proposed to play important roles in many cellular processes. In plants, identification of non-histone methylproteins at a cellular or subcellular scale is still missing. To gain insights into the extent of this modification in chloroplasts we used a bioinformatics approach to identify protein methyltransferases targeted to plastids and set up a workflow to specifically identify Lys and Arg methylated proteins from proteomic data used to produce the Arabidopsis chloroplast proteome. With this approach we could identify 31 high-confidence Lys and Arg methylation sites from 23 chloroplastic proteins, of which only two were previously known to be methylated. These methylproteins are split between the stroma, thylakoids and envelope sub-compartments. They belong to essential metabolic processes, including photosynthesis, and to the chloroplast biogenesis and maintenance machinery (translation, protein <b>import,</b> <b>division).</b> Also, the in silico identification of nine protein methyltransferases that are known or predicted to be targeted to plastids provided a foundation to build the enzymes/substrates relationships that govern methylation in chloroplasts. Thereby, using in vitro methylation assays with chloroplast stroma as a source of methyltransferases we confirmed the methylation sites of two targets, plastid ribosomal protein L 11 and the beta-subunit of ATP synthase. Furthermore, a biochemical screening of recombinant chloroplastic protein Lys methyltransferases allowed us to identify the enzymes involved in the {{modification of}} these substrates. The present study provides a useful resource to build the methyltransferases/methylproteins network and to elucidate the role of protein methylation in chloroplast biology...|$|E

R. Robin Baker, Reader in Zoology at the University of Manchester, is a noted authority on avian navigation. The word 2 ̆ 2 solution 2 ̆ 2 {{in the title}} of this book is somewhat misleading because this book does not solve the mystery of how birds navigate. However, this book is the most thorough, up-to-date review of the various theories on how birds navigate, and integrates these theories to give the reader an idea of how birds might really navigate. The author does an excellent job of presenting all the different ideas in an easily understood and easy to read style. Discussions of each theory include some of the history behind the research, how each theory fits with other theories, how each theory might work on short and long distance movements, and what research needs to be conducted in the future to help clarify how birds navigate. The book explains how birds might navigate under one set of conditions and switch to another navigation technique when conditions change. A fascinating topic presented in a very readable manner.

In modern days banking facilitate clients with innovative services and products because of continuous effort of market research & development.

Foreign Exchange is center attraction of SBL, although the bank has provided other types of banking services also like consumer banking and corporate banking. Total import operational process is same as those of other banks to compliance with international & national acts. From different aspects import trend of SBL has been compared with Bangladesh import pattern. Some anomalies are found and possible recommendations are made based on the comparison analyses. Import is a key instrument of international trade. Bangladesh {{is one of the biggest}} importers comparing to SAARC listed countries. A sustainable economy depends on the major economic indicators like GDP, remittance, export, import and some other factors also. In order to growth successfully sound import has positive impact on country economy. Bangladesh is an overpopulated country with lack of technological and industrial support. On this circumstances Bangladesh have to have depended on imported commodities. The prospective issues of my report are our country’s import progress; Bangladesh Bank’s advanced online system for import, altering policies & regulation so as to make letter of credit process secure and easy. I made comparisons between Bangladesh and SBL based on some import related categories and stated anomalies for those facts like commodity-wise import, country-wise import amount with major listed countries, five years chart on import amount of both SBL and Bangladesh and inferring with recommendations for limitations. SBL on an average has captured 2 % of total import of Bangladesh which is causes for insufficient plan for aggressive approach and inadequate road shows and online advertising. Location wise demand, client capturing strategy and political instability influences commodity-wise ratios and creates gap. If SBL can use different media for advertising, promote advanced service and policy and segment the market then the bank can overcome all limitations. Kowshee AshrafeeB. Business Administratio...|$|E
40|$|Drug {{logistics}} is {{the science}} and art of bringing the right drugs at the right places in the right time in appropriate quantities. The drug supply systems are fields of pharmacy practice that add extra knowledge to the pharmacist different from that acquired at the college. This necessitates the introduction of pharmacy practice to the pharmaceutical curriculum. In the field of military services, drugs are more valuable than weapons as diseases are more dangerous than the enemy fires. The present work had been fulfilled at the Sudanese Medical Corps facilities in the period from 8 / 2000 to 2 / 2004, where continuous crises are common, complaints from {{the performance of the}} supply unit, financial obstacles and organizational instability are common. Lack of drugs at the regional hospitals had persisted even after introducing the health insurance program; the Takaful, which is a risk-sharing mechanism. Soldiers at the war areas suffer from the lack of drugs as their drug supplies were sorted to be on the military financial affairs budget in spite of their payment of the monthly premiums in risk-sharing program. The objectives of the work are to study the drug supply process,to tackle the problems and to contribute to innovation of a supply model based on a scientific background. To achieve these objectives the study had focused on the systems of supply dimensions; policies, planning, organization, selection, procurement, distribution, prescribing and dispensing, financing and security. The study had been organized as follows: Chapter one, the introduction which contains {{a brief description of the}} drug supply dimensions, a historical background of the Sudanese Medical Corps and the pharmaceutical activities of the NFDMS. Chapter two is the literature review which contains a comprehensive study of fourteen elements of the drug supply. They are the policies, the drug logistics planning, organizing drug supply, selection ofdrugs, drug quantification, procurement of drugs, small scale local production, quality assurance, drug donation, distribution, prescribing, dispensing, drug financing and managing security for the supply systems. Chapter three is the objectives of the study. Chapter four is the methodology. Chapter five is the results and discussion which tackled the problems on the fourteen elements of the supply systems of the SMC, discussed and compared with the literature and other similar organizations. Chapter six includes the conclusion and recommendations on each of the mentioned elements independently. Chapter seven is the references and annexes. The subject is concerned with the pharmaceutical practice, management, planning, organizations, financial and military aspects. This explains the expansion of the study. The absence of a sound documented policy statement diverse the plans. The policy statement, the clear objectives and proper planning together with workers will make the NFDMS succeed in achieving the objectives. The performance improvement was in the duties of Takaful and the military administrative area. This raises an image of duality which appears and disappears according to persons occupying the key positions. The selection of drugs is based on informal and non-scientific practices. In the absence of the Pharmacy and Therapeutics Higher Committee which is widely recommended and the existing direct purchases which are due to lack of finance, all sorts of breaches may emerge. Distribution of drugs is a CMS old style, a pull method of requisition, in monthly and weekly intervals. This pool method burdened the Central Warehouses. The storage conditions were inappropriate where the temperature exceeds 40 C in some buildings. The stores are manual type and thermometers were notthere. The problems of transportation in Lorries for 6 - 8 days to some areas make the quality of drugs questionable. Those physicians on the housemanship and those under the National Service are 3 - 4 folds of the military physicians. This results in difficulties in managing the prescribing. Over prescribing of vitamins reaches 85 % of drugs being prescribed. The total vitamins and haematinics expenditure is greater than the total expenditure of antimalarials and cardiovasculardrugs together. Their expenditure is also greater than the summation of GIT drugs, ophthalmologic preparations and cardiovascular drugs expenditure. The dispensing time for the prescription is one minute reflecting the heavy load of work in the day time at the casualties, referred clinics, pediatrics pharmacies; explain the absence of inventory records. The flow of prescriptions to the contracted unaffiliated pharmacies provides an outlet for security breaches. The average item price at the unaffiliated pharmacies is two to three folds of its price at the pharmacies within the system. The total drug expenditure of the drugs from the contracted pharmacies for the year 2003 is four hundred millions Dinars. This amount is twice the drug expenditure for the whole army for the year 1999. The pharmaceutical services in the PAF need to be reorganized. The systems should be rebuilt on scientific basis; more pharmacists should be enlisted to encourage the changes. Autonomous or semiautonomous organization is recommended including the production sector, <b>import</b> <b>division,</b> sales, supply and pharmacies activities. It could be financed by the NFDMS; the contribution of Takaful is appreciated. The war areas could be supplied on cost coverage, Takaful on contract and market sales on investment basis. The Pharmacy and Therapeutics Higher Committee is the corner stone in improving performance. Drug availability at military areas could be enhanced by the establishment of the regional warehouses. Complying with the regulations for purchases through tenders can lead to affordable prices. Wise selection, accurate quantification and implementing regulations will save the resources. The practice of work through committees provides transparency, trust in the syste...|$|E

40|$|We have {{compared}} Saccharomyces cerevisiae global gene expression in wild-type and mutants (ÃŽÂ”hap 2 and ÃŽÂ”hap 4) of the HAP transcriptional complex, {{which has been}} shown to be necessary for growth on respiratory substrates. Several hundred ORFs are under positive or negative control of this complex and we analyse here in detail the effect of HAP on mitochondria. We found that most of the genes upregulated in the wild-type strain were involved in organelle functions, but practically none of the downregulated ones. Nuclear genes encoding the different subunits of the respiratory chain complexes figure in the genes more expressed in the wild-type than in the mutants, as expected, but in this group we also found key components of the mitochondrial translation apparatus. This control of mitochondrial translation may be one of the means of coordinating mitochondrial and nuclear gene expression in elaborating the respiratory chain. In addition, HAP controls the nuclear genes involved in several other mitochondrial processes (<b>import,</b> mitochondrial <b>division)</b> that define the metabolic state of the cell, but not mitochondrial DNA replication and transcription. In most cases, a putative CCAAT-binding site is present upstream of the ORF, while in others no such sites are present, suggesting the control to be indirect.

The {{aim of this}} study was to analyze the genetic and physiological basis for the difference in fruit size between a small (‘Brioso’) and intermediate (‘Cappricia’) sized tomato cultivar exposed to different fruit temperatures. It was hypothesized that fruit heating enhances expression of cell cycle and expansion genes, rates of carbon <b>import,</b> cell <b>division</b> and expansion, and shortens growth duration, whereas increase in cell number intensifies competition for assimilates among cells. Unlike previous studies in which whole-plant and fruit responses cannot be separated, we investigated the temperature response by varying fruit temperature using climate-controlled cuvettes, while keeping plant temperature the same. Fruit phenotype was assessed at different levels of aggregation (whole fruit, cell and gene) between anthesis and breaker stage. We showed that: (1) final fruit fresh weight was larger in ‘Cappricia’ owing to more and larger pericarp cells, (2) heated fruits were smaller because their mesocarp cells were smaller than those of control fruits and (3) no significant differences in pericarp carbohydrate concentration were detected between heated and control fruits nor between cultivars at breaker stage. At the gene level, expression of cell division promoters (CDKB 2, CycA 1 and E 2 Fe-like) was higher while that of the inhibitory fw 2. 2 was lower in ‘Cappricia’.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{research}} is creating a framework to accurately assess the benefits of hub capability in an international distribution network for fast moving consumer packaged goods. The traditional inventory centralization dilemma requires an evaluation of whether the reduction in holding costs outweighs the increases in transportation and handling costs. We developed a mixed integer programming model to determine the benefits of adding hub capability to Consumer Co. 's Northwest Latin American import supply chain. Consumer Co. 's NWLA <b>division</b> <b>imports</b> products from Argentina, Brazil and Mexico to eleven countries within Central and South America, each operating a distribution center. By adding hub capability in the Colon Free Trade Zone, our model determined that the lowest cost could be achieved using a "Hybrid" solution, where some channels flowed through the hub and others were shipped direct. This network design would result in a 4. 4 % reduction in annual relevant costs. A counter-intuitive revelation was the fact that transportation costs could actually decrease. Similar to airlines, carriers can sometimes offer lower rates for indirect shipments passing through a high volume transit point instead of shipping the product directly through a less traveled route. Hub capability in the Colon Free Trade Zone also provides Consumer Co. with the flexibility to tailor their supply chain to potential changes in the fluctuating Latin American environment. Increasing customer expectations can lead to scenarios with higher safety stocks, for which centralization can provide the highest benefits. by Sebastian Ortiz Duran and Richard Hawks. Thesis (M.

40|$|The {{research}} in this thesis was conducted {{as a part of}} the project NAMURBAN (Urban Resource Efficiency in Developing Countries – a pilot study of Walvis Bay, Namibia), a two-year project of Satakunta University of Applied Sciences in Finland. It focuses on the challenges rapid urban development imposes in Namibia and the city of Walvis Bay, on urban infrastructure governance and sectors of water, sanitation and energy. It models these sectors in forms of systems and adapts the multi-level perspective (MLP) and transition management (TM) approaches. The systems and their interactions are described in three levels: 1) the landscape level, 2) regime level and 3) technological niche level and situated in a transition model. The thesis describes the regime membership network of these regimes, the capacities of members and their perceptions towards sustainability transitions of the urban systems through adaptive capacity framework. It adapts the critical viewpoint of political ecology and other theories of political science to deepen the theoretical frameworks of transitions and adaptive capacity. The methodology of the thesis is grounded on a case study and qualitative field research, especially on participant observation method. Most of the material was received during a three-month field visit to Namibia in autumn 2016. This material includes interviews with relevant stakeholders and experts, informal discussions, literature and a questionnaire posed to external experts of the most influential forces in urban development in Namibia. As a result, the following themes are considered as the most influential forces in urban development: 1) water crisis, 2) land ownership and housing, and 3) structural deficits. Other considerable responses included urban spatial planning, public transportation and economic and social issues. The urban water and sanitation regime is characterized by an unequal distribution of water resources, outdated legislation, various practices between the regime members, varying perceptions of the need and expense of technology and the lack of public domains for discussion, key monitoring institutions and a skilled workforce. The urban energy regime is characterized by a high dependency on <b>imported</b> electricity, ideological <b>division</b> between gas and full renewable energies as means of modern electricity supply, active public debate on renewable energy solutions, the roles of independent power producers (IPPs) and market-dominating state parastatal NamPower, and the shift from a single-buyer model to a modified single-buyer model. The thesis concludes that understanding the water-energy nexus is essential in urban development; the MLP approach would highly benefit from the theoretical field of political science and should be orientated towards a developing country context. As a result, system modeling may further assist in capacity building in urban sectors...|$|R
