5|$|A {{number of}} {{industries}} and sources have been implicated, including {{high levels of}} dust in coal mining, gold mining, and the cotton textile industry, occupations involving cadmium and isocyanates, and fumes from welding. Working in agriculture is also a risk. In some professions the risks have been estimated as equivalent to that of one half to two packs of cigarettes a day. Silica dust and fiberglass dust <b>exposure</b> {{can also lead to}} COPD, with the risk unrelated to that for silicosis. The negative effects of dust <b>exposure</b> and cigarette smoke <b>exposure</b> appear to be additive or possibly more than additive.|$|E
5|$|A {{person can}} be exposed to uranium (or its {{radioactive}} daughters, such as radon) by inhaling dust in air or by ingesting contaminated water and food. The amount of uranium in air is usually very small; however, {{people who work in}} factories that process phosphate fertilizers, live near government facilities that made or tested nuclear weapons, live or work near a modern battlefield where depleted uranium weapons have been used, or live or work near a coal-fired power plant, facilities that mine or process uranium ore, or enrich uranium for reactor fuel, may have increased <b>exposure</b> to uranium. Houses or structures that are over uranium deposits (either natural or man-made slag deposits) may have an increased incidence of <b>exposure</b> to radon gas. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) has set the permissible <b>exposure</b> limit for uranium <b>exposure</b> in the workplace as 0.25mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended <b>exposure</b> limit (REL) of 0.2mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short-term limit of 0.6mg/m3. At levels of 10mg/m3, uranium is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E
5|$|According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, {{short-term}} <b>exposure</b> to platinum salts {{may cause}} irritation of the eyes, nose, and throat, and long-term <b>exposure</b> may cause both respiratory and skin allergies. The current OSHA standard is 2micrograms {{per cubic meter}} of air averaged over an 8-hour work shift. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended <b>exposure</b> limit (REL) for platinum as 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday.|$|E

40|$|The weekday UV <b>exposures</b> to {{anatomical}} {{sites were}} evaluated for outdoor workers, home workers, adolescents, indoor workers, school staff {{and students in}} south-east Queensland, Australia. Additionally, the UV <b>exposures</b> at weekends of school staff, school students, indoor workers and outdoor workers were evaluated. The weekday <b>exposures</b> per day ranged from 1. 0 to 11. 0 SED for winter to summer respectively. During spring, the ratios of the personal <b>exposures</b> divided by the ambient <b>exposures</b> at the weekend to the personal <b>exposures</b> divided by the ambient <b>exposures</b> on the weekdays to the neck, hand and left arm were at least 3. 4, 2. 0 and 0. 67 for the indoor workers, school staff and students and outdoor workers respectively. The same ratios for the erythemal UV <b>exposures</b> over the year, estimated from the <b>exposures</b> on four days {{in each of the}} four seasons, were at least 2. 3 for the school staff and at least 1. 3 for the 13 to 19 year old school students. These results reinforce the importance of targeting prevention programmes to both weekend and weekday <b>exposures...</b>|$|R
5|$|CTW enlisted Palmer, in {{conjunction}} with Harvard University, in 1979 to conduct a study in Jamaica regarding the effects of Sesame Street on children with no <b>exposure</b> to other children's television programs, in order to correct {{for the effects of}} multimedia <b>exposure</b> on children in the US. Palmer discovered that Jamaican children's interest dropped during segments with the Muppets, possibly due to language and cultural differences; musical segments were the most effective. The children's learning increased after <b>exposure</b> to the show, especially letter and number recognition.|$|E
5|$|Double- and multi- <b>exposure</b> {{holography}} is one {{of three}} methods used to create holographic interferograms. A first <b>exposure</b> records the object in an unstressed state. Subsequent exposures on the same photographic plate are made while the object is subjected to some stress. The composite image depicts the difference between the stressed and unstressed states.|$|E
5|$|<b>Exposure</b> to lead {{may also}} {{decrease}} lifespan and have health {{effects in the}} long term. Death rates {{from a variety of}} causes {{have been found to be}} higher in people with elevated blood lead levels; these include cancer, stroke, and heart disease, and general death rates from all causes. Lead is considered a possible human carcinogen based on evidence from animal studies. Evidence also suggests that age-related mental decline and psychiatric symptoms are correlated with lead <b>exposure.</b> Cumulative <b>exposure</b> over a prolonged period may have a more important effect on some aspects of health than recent <b>exposure.</b> Some health effects, such as high blood pressure, are only significant risks when lead <b>exposure</b> is prolonged (over about one year).|$|E

40|$|The {{influence}} of cloud on the solar UVA (320 - 400 nm) <b>exposures</b> over five minute periods on a horizontal plane has been investigated. The first approach used cloud modification factors that were evaluated using the {{influence of}} clouds on the global solar <b>exposures</b> (310 - 2, 800 nm) and a model developed to apply these to the clear sky UVA <b>exposures</b> to allow calculation of the five minute UVA <b>exposures</b> for any cloud conditions. The second approach established {{a relationship between the}} UVA and the global solar <b>exposures.</b> The models were developed using {{the first six months of}} data in 2012 for SZA less than or equal to 70 degrees and were applied and evaluated for the <b>exposures</b> in the second half of 2012. This comparison of the modelled <b>exposures</b> for all cloud conditions to the measured data provided an R 2 of 0. 8 for the cloud modification model, compared to an R 2 of 0. 7 for the UVA/global model. The cloud modification model provided 73 % of the five minute <b>exposures</b> within 20 % of the measured UVA <b>exposures.</b> This was improved to 89 % of the <b>exposures</b> within 20 % of the measured UVA <b>exposures</b> for the cases of cloud with the sun not obscured. ...|$|R
30|$|Combined <b>exposures</b> {{reaching}} this Step {{have been}} shown to have passed a chemical-by-chemical assessment (Step 5), but failed a screening assessment of toxicity of combined <b>exposures</b> (Step 13). These <b>exposures</b> are placed into Group III. This group should be the focus of assessments of combined <b>exposures</b> since they are the <b>exposures</b> of potential concern that are missed by chemical-by-chemical approaches. In Step 14, the Maximum Cumulative Ratio (MCR) is determined for these chemicals. <b>Exposures</b> with MCR values of less than two moves to Step 15 and those with values greater than two move to Step 16.|$|R
5|$|<b>Exposure</b> to yttrium {{compounds}} in humans may cause lung disease. Workers exposed to airborne yttrium europium vanadate dust experienced mild eye, skin, and {{upper respiratory tract}} irritationâ€”though this {{may be caused by}} the vanadium content rather than the yttrium. Acute <b>exposure</b> to yttrium compounds can cause shortness of breath, coughing, chest pain, and cyanosis. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) limits <b>exposure</b> to yttrium in the workplace to 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) recommended <b>exposure</b> limit (REL) is 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. At levels of 500mg/m3, yttrium is immediately dangerous to life and health. Yttrium dust is flammable.|$|E
5|$|Gas metal {{arc welding}} can be {{dangerous}} if proper precautions are not taken. Since GMAW employs an electric arc, welders wear protective clothing, including heavy leather gloves and protective long sleeve jackets, to avoid <b>exposure</b> to extreme heat and flames. In addition, {{the brightness of the}} electric arc is a source of the condition known as arc eye, an inflammation of the cornea caused by ultraviolet light and, in prolonged <b>exposure,</b> possible burning of the retina in the eye. Conventional welding helmets contain dark face plates to prevent this <b>exposure.</b> Newer helmet designs feature a liquid crystal-type face plate that self-darken upon <b>exposure</b> to high amounts of UV light. Transparent welding curtains, made of a polyvinyl chloride plastic film, are often used to shield nearby workers and bystanders from <b>exposure</b> to the UV light from the electric arc.|$|E

5|$|Manganese <b>exposure</b> in United States is {{regulated}} by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). People can be exposed to manganese in the workplace by breathing it in or swallowing it. OSHA has set the legal limit (permissible <b>exposure</b> limit) for manganese <b>exposure</b> in the workplace as 5mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday. The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has set a recommended <b>exposure</b> limit (REL) of 1mg/m3 over an 8-hour workday and a short term limit of 3mg/m3. At levels of 500mg/m3, manganese is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E

40|$|Definitions {{are given}} for weak and strong {{sufficient}} cause interactions in settings {{in which the}} outcome is binary and {{in which there are}} two <b>exposures</b> of interest that are categorical or ordinal. Weak sufficient cause interactions concern cases in which a mechanism will operate under certain values of the two <b>exposures</b> but not when {{one or the other of}} the <b>exposures</b> takes some other value. Strong sufficient cause interactions concern cases in which a mechanism will operate under certain values of the two <b>exposures</b> but not when one or the other of the <b>exposures</b> takes any other value. Empirical conditions are derived for such interactions when <b>exposures</b> have two or three levels and are related to regression coefficients in linear and log-linear models. When the <b>exposures</b> are binary, the notions of a weak and a strong sufficient cause interaction coincide, but not when the <b>exposures</b> are categorical or ordinal. The results are applied to examples concerning gene-gene and gene-environment interactions. Copyright 2010, Oxford University Press. ...|$|R
30|$|A {{decision}} tree {{has been developed}} for evaluating risks posed by combined <b>exposures</b> to multiple chemicals. The {{decision tree}} divides combined <b>exposures</b> of humans and ecological receptors into groups where one or more components are a concern by themselves, where risks from the combined <b>exposures</b> are of low concern, and {{where there is a}} concern for the effects from the combined <b>exposures</b> but not from individual chemicals. This paper applies the decision tree to real-world examples of <b>exposures</b> to multiple chemicals, evaluates the usefulness of the approach, and identifies issues arising from the application.|$|R
5|$|Molybdenum dusts and fumes, {{generated}} by mining or metalworking, can be toxic, especially if ingested (including dust {{trapped in the}} sinuses and later swallowed). Low levels of prolonged <b>exposure</b> can cause irritation to the eyes and skin. Direct inhalation or ingestion of molybdenum and its oxides should be avoided. OSHA regulations specify the maximum permissible molybdenum <b>exposure</b> in an 8-hour day as 5mg/m3. Chronic <b>exposure</b> to 60 to 600mg/m3 can cause symptoms including fatigue, headaches and joint pains. At levels of 5000mg/m3, molybdenum is immediately dangerous to life and health.|$|E

50|$|Environmental {{epidemiology}} is {{a branch}} of epidemiology concerned {{with the discovery of}} the environmental <b>exposures</b> that contribute to or protect against injuries, illnesses, developmental conditions, disabilities, and deaths; and identification of public health and health care actions to manage the risks associated with harmful <b>exposures.</b> Environmental epidemiology studies external factors that affect the incidence, prevalence, and geographic range of health conditions. These factors may be naturally occurring or may be introduced into environments where people live, work, and play. Environmental <b>exposures</b> are involuntary and thus generally exclude occupational <b>exposures</b> (covered by occupational epidemiology) and voluntary <b>exposures</b> such as active smoking, medications, and diet.|$|R
30|$|A {{series of}} tools were created that include: a {{decision}} tree, {{a system for}} grouping <b>exposures,</b> and a graphical tool (the MCR-HI plot). The decision tree allows the division of combined <b>exposures</b> into different groups, <b>exposures</b> where one or more individual components are a concern, <b>exposures</b> that are of low concern, and <b>exposures</b> that are a concern for combined effects {{but not for the}} effects of individual chemicals. These tools efficiently use available data, identify critical data gaps for combined assessments, and prioritize which chemicals require detailed toxicity information. The tools can be used to address multiple human health endpoints and ecological effects.|$|R
