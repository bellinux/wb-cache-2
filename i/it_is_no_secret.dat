But history cannot be rewritten, however much we might sometimes wish otherwise. It has its moments of sadness, as well as gladness. We must learn from the sadness and build on the gladness.|$|E
500|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that cardistry, {{like magic}} generally, is {{populated}} mainly by males. [...] Some {{have observed that}} the split is roughly 9 to 1, male-to-female. The reasons and remedies, if any, are subject to dispute.|$|E
500|$|Chamberlain {{hoped that}} a {{cancellation}} of the war debt owed to the United States could be negotiated. In June 1933, Britain hosted the World Monetary and Economic Conference. Describing the event as the [...] "most crucial gathering since Versailles", Time magazine featured Chamberlain on its cover, referring to him as [...] "that mighty mover behind British Cabinet scenes, lean, taciturn, iron-willed... <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that Scot MacDonald remains Prime Minister by Prime Mover Chamberlain's leave." [...] The Conference came to nothing, when US President Franklin Roosevelt sent word {{that he would not}} consider any war debt cancellation. After the US Congress passed the Johnson Act, forbidding loans to nations in default on their debts, Chamberlain felt that Britain could not pay the entire debt, and, as the Act made no distinction between a partial and complete default, the Chancellor entirely suspended Britain's war debt payments to the US.|$|E

500|$|On 16 May 2011, Brodie {{signed for}} Conference Premier club Fleetwood Town on loan for 2011–12 for a five-figure loan fee. Homesickness was {{cited as the}} reason for the transfer, with manager Evans saying [...] "Richard is a very talented lad but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> he has failed to settle away from his family home". Brodie debuted as a 54th-minute {{substitute}} for Magno Vieira in Fleetwood's 2–0 away win over Grimsby on 13 August 2011. His first goal for Fleetwood was the team's fifth goal in a 5–2 home victory over Kidderminster on 20 September 2011. Brodie's sixth goal for Fleetwood came on 26 December 2011 against Southport, when he scored a late equaliser in the 88th minute to make the score 2–2 in front of 3,029 supporters, a record home league attendance for Fleetwood. He scored twice during the away league match against the same club on 1 January 2012, the first coming after just four minutes and the second coming in the 29th minute, which made the score 3–0 to Fleetwood. Two minutes after scoring his second goal Brodie was sent off after receiving a second yellow card, although his team {{went on to win the}} match 6–0. He made 39 appearances and scored 10 goals in 2011–12 and won his second Conference Premier winner's medal in as many seasons, as Fleetwood won the title and therefore promotion into League Two.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2013, {{rumors of}} a reunion began as the band posted a photo on their {{official}} Facebook page with the caption [...] "What's going on here...?" [...] Woomble, Jones and Newton were tagged in the photo of a recording/rehearsal studio. On 5 November, Roddy Woomble confirmed that the band {{were in the process}} of writing a new album, stating: [...] "I have been getting asked about this a lot recently, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that Idlewild are making a new album (There are some photographs of a recent writing session in a Hebridean cabin up on the Idlewild facebook page) it is being written and recorded slowly and intermittently, and I have no idea when it’ll be done. Not for a while. I’m just enjoying the process. It is always great to work with Rod and Colin, we have been making up songs together since 1995 – not far off 20 years! Gareth and Allan have not been involved much so far due to both their other touring commitments, but they will be in time, as will others." [...] In January 2014 the band started recording their next studio effort and had two 'live' dates, one at Musicport. Through his blog Roddy Woomble revealed that Gareth Russell had left the band back in 2013 and Lucci Rossi had joined the band as new bassist.|$|E
2500|$|German {{chancellor}} Angela Merkel {{has repeatedly}} opposed full membership of Turkey to the EU on German-Turkish summits, advocating instead a privileged partnership. Some Christian Democrats back fuller support for Turkey, risking the chancellor becoming more isolated in advocating for a [...] "privileged partnership". In September 2011, {{on the occasion}} of the visit of the Turkish president Gül, Merkel said: [...] "We don't want the full membership of Turkey. But we don't want to lose Turkey as an important country", referring to her idea of a strategic partnership. In 2006, Chancellor Merkel said [...] "Turkey could be in deep, deep trouble when it comes to its aspirations to join the European Union" [...] regarding its refusal to open up its ports to European Union member Cyprus. Again in 2014, when Erdogan urged Merkel to strongly support his country's bid, there was no sign the chancellor had relinquished her skepticism. She revealed after the two had talked: [...] "I personally said that we are in a negotiation process that has certain outcome and no fixed time frame. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> and nothing has changed in my view that I am sceptical about full membership for Turkey." [...] In a TV debate in September 2017, German chancellor Angela Merkel and her challenger Martin Schulz both said that they would seek an end to Turkey’s membership talks with the European Union.|$|E

5000|$|He {{served as}} a Privy Councillor under William III and Mary II in 1689.

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> {{that the}} war was {{conceived}} to increase the king's popularity and influence, and diminish that of his, mostly noble, opponents. The anger was fueled also by Cabinet members who felt duped to support the war plans by the king's selective quoting of diplomatic reports from Saint Petersburg. The failed attempts to besiege and recapture Hamina and Savonlinna, both of which had been in Russian hands since 1743, ultimately ignited a vehement opposition among the officers, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> said that even the king wished for peace.|$|R
6000|$|... "Moreover, methinks {{that the}} king would, for another reason, {{make every effort to}} buy Lord Grey's freedom; for <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that he has no great love for Mortimer; for {{although}} he holds the young Earl of March a prisoner, at Windsor, he cannot forget that the lad is the rightful heir to the throne, and that the friends of Richard would place him there, had they the opportunity. Mortimer is the boy's uncle and, not only from his own estates, but as guardian of the young earl's wide possessions in Hereford and in Shropshire, is a very powerful noble.|$|E
6000|$|... "I do {{not think}} we shall be {{otherwise}} than inferior in force even when our last regiment comes up," [...] Hector said.

He {{is said to be}} very clever, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that he is {{nominated}} to the council on Richelieu's recommendation, which speaks volumes in his favour, for Richelieu was a judge of men, and must have believed, when recommending him, that Mazarin would render good service to France. But however clever he is he cannot replace the great cardinal. On him was stamped by nature the making of a ruler of men. He was tall, handsome, and an accomplished cavalier. Seeing him dressed as a noble among noblemen, one would have picked him out as born to be the greatest of them. No doubt this noble appearance, aided by his haughty manner and by his ruthlessness in punishing those who conspired against him, had not a little to do with his mastery over men.|$|E
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> {{that the}} Haganah had been {{smuggling}} arms {{into the country}} ever since the riots in 1929 and {{the discovery of the}} shipment gave credence to the claim that the Jews of Palestine were arming on a large scale. Since 1929 the Haganah had sent representatives to Belgium, France and Italy to purchase weapons which were often smuggled into Palestine in crates and luggage. A sharp sense of danger was thus derived from the perception that the Zionist movement was on the road to attaining the military capacity to establish its state.|$|R
5000|$|At {{the time}} of his accession, Lower Burma, half of the kingdom's former territory, had been under British {{occupation}} for thirty years and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that the King intended to regain this territory. Relations had soured during the early 1880s when the King was perceived as having made moves to align his country with the French more closely. Relations deteriorated further in an incident later called [...] "The Great Shoe Question", where visiting British dignitaries refused to remove their shoes before entering the royal palace and were subsequently banished.|$|R
5000|$|Mrs Philipson was {{formerly}} Miss Mabel Russell, and a well-known actress, before her marriage. which included being the leading Lady in Gerald du Maurier's play [...] "London Pride".

She is as careful and as saving as when she was the wife of a small country gentleman in Corsica, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that she has little confidence in the permanence of the present state of things, and that she is always laying by for an evil day.

60|$|It {{is not for}} us to {{allude to}} the sacred sorrows of the {{bereaved}} home at Down; but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that, outside that domestic group, there are many to whom Mr. Darwin's death is a wholly irreparable loss. And this not merely because of his wonderfully genial, simple, and generous nature; his cheerful and animated conversation, and the infinite variety and accuracy of his information; but because the more one knew of him, the more he seemed the incorporated ideal of a man of science. Acute as were his reasoning powers, vast as was his knowledge, marvellous as was his tenacious industry, under physical difficulties which would have converted nine men out of ten into aimless invalids; it was not these qualities, great as they were, which impressed those who were admitted to his intimacy with involuntary veneration, but a certain intense and almost passionate honesty by which all his thoughts and actions were irradiated, as by a central fire.|$|E

5000|$|Upon {{entering}} the SAFA, West Adelaide changed their colours to black and red, the colours previously {{worn by the}} defunct Adelaide Football Club and moved its training headquarters from the South to the West Parklands. The club often struggled to field a full team {{in its early years}} as clubs were then controlled by wealthy businessmen and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>no</b> <b>secret</b> that players <b>were</b> regularly poached from less wealthy clubs. West Adelaide was one of the [...] "poor" [...] clubs and consequently won only one of its first 31 matches.|$|R
