Can a society be repaired unless its killers, rapists, and torturers are named and exposed? Can it be repaired if its killers, rapists, and torturers are named and exposed? That is the overarching question of transitional justice; {{it may even be}} the overarching question of life in human society.

Sonnabend served as Medical Director of CRI/CRIA until 1996.|$|E
5|$|Another {{way of life}} of chemotrophs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> {{possible}} electron acceptors is fermentation, {{wherein the}} electrons taken from the reduced substrates are transferred to oxidised intermediates to generate reduced fermentation products (e.g., lactate, ethanol, hydrogen, butyric acid). Fermentation is possible, because the energy content of the substrates is {{higher than that of}} the products, which allows the organisms to synthesise ATP and drive their metabolism.|$|E

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 19th century, {{scientists}} {{generally recognized}} that the number of neurons in the adult brain (roughly 100 billion) did not increase significantly with age, giving neurobiologists good reason to believe that memories were generally not the result of new neuron production.

5|$|Disturbance is {{important}} in the creation of biodiverse habitats. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> disturbance, a climax vegetation cover develops that prevents the establishment of other species. Wildflower meadows are sometimes created by conservationists but most of the flowering plants used are either annuals or biennials and disappear after a few years <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>absence</b> <b>of</b> patches of bare ground on which their seedlings can grow. Lightning strikes and toppled trees in tropical forests allow species richness to be maintained as pioneering species move in to fill the gaps created. Similarly coastal habitats can become dominated by kelp until the seabed is disturbed by a storm and the algae swept away, or shifting sediment exposes new areas for colonisation. Another cause of disturbance is when an area may be overwhelmed by an invasive introduced species which is not kept under control by natural enemies in its new habitat.|$|E
