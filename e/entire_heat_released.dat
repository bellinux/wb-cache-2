Individual component materials and combination of them were tested. A high radiative heat flux of 50 kW m- 2 was used to consume all materials in the tests. The sustained ignition time, peak <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate and total <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate were deduced from the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate curves. These data are useful for classifying the materials by calculating two parameters describing the possibility to flashover. The superposition of <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate curves and total <b>heat</b> <b>released</b> (THR) were studied.

Dividing the specific <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate (W/g) by the {{rate of temperature rise}} (K/s) gives a material fire parameter with the units (J/g-K) and significance of a <b>heat</b> (<b>release)</b> capacity. The <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> capacity appears to be a true material property that is rooted in the chemical structure of the polymer and is calculable from additive molar group contributions.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{equivalence}} ratio, H 2 and CO 2 on the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> {{characteristics of the}} premixed laminar biogas-hydrogen flame were investigated with the chemical kinetics simulation using the detailed chemical mechanism. The <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rates, reaction rates and mole fractions of species of the BG 50, BG 75 and methane flames were calculated at different hydrogen additions (10 %- 50 %) and equivalence ratios (0. 8, 1. 0, 1. 2). The contributions of major elementary reactions were obtained based on the simulation data. The results show that H + O 2 = OH + H is the major endothermic reaction for biogas-hydrogen flame, while H + CH 3 (+M) = CH 4 (+M), O + CH 3 = H + CH 2 O, OH + H 2 = H + H 2 O, O + CH 3 =>H + H 2 + CO and OH + CO = H + CO 2 can always play significant roles in <b>heat</b> <b>release.</b> O + CH 3 = H + CH 2 O and O + CH 3 =>H + H 2 + CO can consistently account for a relatively stable proportion of total <b>heat</b> <b>release,</b> meaning that the O × CH 3 product can be an indicator to predict the total <b>heat</b> <b>release.</b> Due to the variation of O 2 concentration, the changes of major exothermic reactions are predominated by the equivalence ratio. Though the global <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate is maximum at stoichiometric condition, there exists more <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> in the high temperature zone at rich condition due to the exothermic recombination of radicals. The total <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> can be increased evidently with the H 2 addition which can induce the early <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> and enhance the peak <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate, and the significances of OH + H 2 = H + H 2 O and H + OH + M = H 2 O + M on the total <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> are enhanced most evidently.

30|$|The cited NBS <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate {{calorimeter}} {{was developed}} by Parker and Long (1972), to which Sensenig and Parker (1978) later added OCC capability. It was a bench scale calorimeter which included radiative heating of the sample and measured <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate by a thermal compensation method whereby a gas burner is varied to maintain a fixed exhaust temperature in the apparatus exhaust such that the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate of the sample {{is the same as}} the reduction in the required burner <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate. This was a predecessor of the cone calorimeter.|$|R
30|$|The first <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate {{method was}} a thermal {{compensation}} method for measuring <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate prior {{the development of}} OCC (Thompson and Cousins 1959). The method was implemented in the FM Roof Calorimeter. Simple temperature and flow measurements in the exhaust stream {{were found to be}} of low fidelity due to heat losses in the exhaust system. The OSU Calorimeter (Smith 1971), an early bench scale test for measuring <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate, used this method. Measurements of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide have also been used with exhaust flow rate measurements to determine <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate (Tewarson and Tamanini 1976, Tewarson and Pion 1977). However, the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate per mass of carbon dioxide/carbon monoxide is more dependent on the composition of the fuel than is oxygen consumption, and measuring <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate using carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide (and other hydrocarbon measurements) is more complex, expensive and time consuming to perform.|$|R
30|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>release</b> rate is an {{important}} fire severity characteristic relating to fire safety (Babrauskas and Peacock 1992). The <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate time-history defines {{the growth of the}} fire and other related characteristics such as the peak <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate, the time to the peak and the total energy release which in turn determine some measures of the severity of the fire particularly when considering the impacts to people and property remote from the vehicle itself. Moreover, the fire environment can be assessed using the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate information as input to a calculation. For example, the smoke layer height as a measure of tenability can be predicted by a computational model once the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate is determined. In addition, the tenability components of smoke such as obscuration, toxic species and heat may need to be determined and these components can often be obtained {{as a function of the}} <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate.

40|$|Many big {{construction}} projects in Hong Kong have difficulties {{to comply with}} prescriptive fire codes. Fire safety provisions {{have to go through}} Fire Engineering Approach (FEA) or performance-based design (PBD). The <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate of a design fire is the most important parameter in fire safety assessment. However, a very low design fire less than 5 MW is usually assumed, even in large crowded spaces, such as public transport terminals and shopping malls. Surveys indicated that local buildings usually store combustibles exceeding the upper limit imposed by the codes. A post-flashover fire due to whatever reason would give even higher <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate.

40|$|Available safe egress time is an {{important}} criterion to determine occupant safety in performance-based fire protection design of buildings. There are many factors affecting the calculation of available safe egress time, such as <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate, smoke toxicity and the geometry of the building. <b>Heat</b> <b>release</b> rate is the most critical factor. Due to the variation of fuel layout, initial ignition location and many other factors, significant uncertainties are associated with <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate. Traditionally, fire safety engineers prefer to ignore these uncertainties, and a fixed value of <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate is assigned based on experience. This makes the available safe egress time results subjective.

In fact, the gross <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> is actually the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> due to a combination of all the chemical reactions (combustion, dissociation, re-association).

These results for equivalence ratio ranging from 0. 8 to 1. 1 are compared with computations of one-dimensional freely-propagating flames. The performance of these markers is studied based on the following two aspects: the spatial accuracy of the local <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate and the trend in the total <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate with equivalence ratio. The measured trend in the spatial distribution of radicals and the deduced <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate agree well with the computational values.

Combustibles of concern are furniture foam, partitions and surface lining materials. Equations {{appearing in the}} literature for calculating the <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rates of these combustibles are used. <b>Heat</b> <b>release</b> rates of furniture foams were studied first, followed by igniting surface lining materials classified under the Swedish system. The likelihood of flashover in those 900 karaoke music compartments was then investigated. Further, the total <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate curves for burning foam, surface lining materials and carpets are studied using the results reported in the literature. Based on this study, it is recommended to select furniture foam with less <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rates upon burning, and replace timber surface lining materials as soon as possible. As an urgent action, a good fire safety management scheme "tailor-made" for individual karaokes is to be imp lemented. Department of Building Services Engineerin...|$|R
40|$|A {{method for}} extrapolating the time {{dependent}} <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rates obtained from Cone Calorimeter measurements is presented. This method is implemented by fitting model parameters to experimental <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate data obtained at a specified level of irradiance and evaluating the resulting function at {{the values of}} interest. The method was validated by comparing the predicted <b>heat</b> <b>release</b> rate curves for wallboard and ceiling tiles, which were calibrated using data obtained at an irradiance of 95 kW/m 2, to experimental measurement...|$|R
