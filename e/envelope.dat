The viral <b>envelope</b> contains proteins from the host cell and relatively few copies of the HIV <b>Envelope</b> protein, which consists of a cap made of three molecules known as glycoprotein (gp) 120, and a stem consisting of three gp41 molecules which anchor the structure into the viral <b>envelope.</b> The <b>Envelope</b> protein, encoded by the HIV env gene, allows the virus to attach to target cells and fuse the viral <b>envelope</b> with the target cell membrane releasing the viral contents into the cell and initiating the infectious cycle.|$|E

5|$|As {{the sole}} viral protein {{on the surface}} of the virus, the <b>Envelope</b> protein is a major target for HIV vaccine efforts. Over half of the mass of the trimeric <b>envelope</b> spike is N-linked glycans. The density is high as the glycans shield the {{underlying}} viral protein from neutralisation by antibodies. This is one of the most densely glycosylated molecules known and the density is sufficiently high to prevent the normal maturation process of glycans during biogenesis in the endoplasmic and Golgi apparatus. The majority of the glycans are therefore stalled as immature 'high-mannose' glycans not normally present on secreted or cell surface human glycoproteins. The unusual processing and high density means that almost all broadly neutralising antibodies that have so far been identified (from a subset of patients that have been infected for many months to years) bind to or, are adapted to cope with, these <b>envelope</b> glycans.|$|E

5|$|Both enveloped and unenveloped virions are infectious. The viral <b>envelope</b> {{is made of}} {{modified}} Golgi membranes containing viral-specific polypeptides, including hemagglutinin. Infection {{with either}} variola major or variola minor confers immunity against the other.|$|E
5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral <b>envelope.</b> This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the <b>envelope</b> for their infectivity.|$|E

Dexter follows Arthur to a bank, where he sees Arthur bring a large <b>envelope</b> back to his van.

5|$|In most cells, the {{disassembly}} of {{the nuclear}} <b>envelope</b> {{marks the end of}} the prophase of mitosis. However, this disassembly of the nucleus is not a universal feature of mitosis and does not occur in all cells. Some unicellular eukaryotes (e.g., yeasts) undergo so-called closed mitosis, in which the nuclear <b>envelope</b> remains intact. In closed mitosis, the daughter chromosomes migrate to opposite poles of the nucleus, which then divides in two. The cells of higher eukaryotes, however, usually undergo open mitosis, which is characterized by breakdown {{of the nuclear}} <b>envelope.</b> The daughter chromosomes then migrate to opposite poles of the mitotic spindle, and new nuclei reassemble around them.|$|E

5|$|The Patries <b>envelope</b> was {{composed}} of four alternating layers of cotton cloth and vulcanised rubber (the <b>envelope</b> of its predecessor, the Jaune, comprised three layers). The outside layer was of cotton cloth, covered with lead chromate to prevent the actinic components of sunlight from destroying the rubber skin which formed the second layer. This second layer prevented leakage of the hydrogen lifting gas from the <b>envelope.</b> The third layer was of cotton, which was protected by the rubber fourth and final layer from damage caused by the hydrogen. This final rubber layer was thinner, and therefore lighter, than the first. The rubber sheeting for the second and fourth layers was supplied by the German company Continental AG.|$|E

5|$|The {{difference}} {{in the shape of}} the light curves is believed to be caused, in the case of TypeII-L supernovae, by the expulsion of most of the hydrogen <b>envelope</b> of the progenitor star. The plateau phase in TypeII-P supernovae is due to a change in the opacity of the exterior layer. The shock wave ionizes the hydrogen in the outer <b>envelope</b> – stripping the electron from the hydrogen atom – resulting in a significant increase in the opacity. This prevents photons from the inner parts of the explosion from escaping. When the hydrogen cools sufficiently to recombine, the outer layer becomes transparent.|$|E
40|$|When {{cells of}} the {{bacterium}} Salmonella typhimurium are incubated with penicillin and lysed in a dilute buffer, flagellated cytoplasm-free <b>envelopes</b> are formed. When the <b>envelopes</b> are tethered to glass by their flagella and then energized, some of them spin. The direction of rotation of wild-type <b>envelopes</b> is exclusively counterclockwise (CCW). We perturbed this system by including in the lysis medium (and hence in the <b>envelopes)</b> the chemotaxis protein CheY. As a result, some of the <b>envelopes</b> rotated exclusively clockwise (CW). The fraction of <b>envelopes</b> that did so increased with the concentration of CheY; at a concentration of 48 microM (pH 8), all functional <b>envelopes</b> spun CW. The fraction also increased with the pH of the lysis medium {{in the range of}} 6. 6 - 8. 4. The results were the same in {{the presence or absence of}} intracellular Ca 2 +. Reconstituted <b>envelopes</b> failed to respond to chemotactic stimuli. None of them changed the direction of their rotation. However, when the intracellular pH was lowered to 6. 6 or below, <b>envelopes</b> that spun CW stopped rotating, while <b>envelopes</b> that spun CCW continued to rotate. This phenomenon was reversible. We conclude that CheY per se, without any additional free cytoplasmic mediators, interacts with a switch at the base of the flagellum to cause CW rotation...|$|R
