5|$|The {{benefits}} of benzodiazepines are least {{and the risks}} are greatest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly.</b> The elderly are at {{an increased risk of}} dependence and are more sensitive to the adverse effects such as memory problems, daytime sedation, impaired motor coordination, and increased risk of motor vehicle accidents and falls, and an increased risk of hip fractures. The long-term effects of benzodiazepines and benzodiazepine dependence <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> can resemble dementia, depression, or anxiety syndromes, and progressively worsens over time. Adverse effects on cognition can be mistaken for the effects of old age. The {{benefits of}} withdrawal include improved cognition, alertness, mobility, reduced risk incontinence, and a reduced risk of falls and fractures. The success of gradual-tapering benzodiazepines is as great <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> as in younger people. Benzodiazepines should be prescribed to the elderly only with caution and only for a short period at low doses. Short to intermediate-acting benzodiazepines are preferred <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> such as oxazepam and temazepam. The high potency benzodiazepines alprazolam and triazolam and long-acting benzodiazepines are not recommended <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> due to increased adverse effects. Nonbenzodiazepines such as zaleplon and zolpidem and low doses of sedating antidepressants are sometimes used as alternatives to benzodiazepines.|$|E
5|$|Additional {{caution is}} {{required}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly,</b> {{as they are}} {{more sensitive to the}} pharmacological effects of benzodiazepines, metabolise them more slowly, and are more prone to adverse effects, including drowsiness, amnesia (especially anterograde amnesia), ataxia, hangover effects, confusion, and falls.|$|E

The subjects were 697 Japanese dependent elderly living at welfare institutions for the aged, and 482 independent elderly living at home. Seventy-four activities were selected from nine ADL domains. The survey for <b>the</b> independent <b>elderly</b> was conducted in health or culture education classes, and for <b>the</b> <b>elderly</b> without these classes, a general delivery survey was conducted. <b>The</b> independent <b>elderly</b> provided their own data.

Additional caution is required in critically ill patients, as accumulation of midazolam and its active metabolites may occur.

Contraindications include hypersensitivity, acute narrow-angle glaucoma, shock, hypotension, or head injury. Most are relative contraindications.|$|E

5|$|It is conjectured that a {{progressive}} decline in hormone levels with age is partially responsible for weakened immune responses in aging individuals. Conversely, some hormones are {{regulated by the}} immune system, notably thyroid hormone activity. The age-related decline in immune function is also related to decreasing vitamin D levels <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>elderly.</b> As people age, two things happen that negatively affect their vitamin D levels. First, they stay indoors more due to decreased activity levels. This means that they get less sun and therefore produce less cholecalciferol via UVB radiation. Second, as a person ages the skin becomes less adept at producing vitamin D.|$|E
5|$|Most {{people with}} {{hypothyroidism}} symptoms and confirmed thyroxine deficiency {{are treated with}} a synthetic long-acting form of thyroxine, known as levothyroxine (L-thyroxine).

Lower doses may be sufficient in those with subclinical hypothyroidism, while people with central hypothyroidism may require a higher than average dose.|$|E

5|$|The {{most common}} {{side-effects}} of benzodiazepines {{are related to}} their sedating and muscle-relaxing action.

Decreased libido and erection problems are a common side effect. Depression and disinhibition may emerge.
