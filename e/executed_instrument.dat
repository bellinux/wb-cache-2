50|$|Apart from advising, a notary also draws, executes, and retains {{instruments}} {{either by}} statute {{or at the}} parties' request. Under Dutch law, a notarially <b>executed</b> <b>instrument</b> is probative as of the data certa (vaste datum) and subscription of the parties. Notaries archive the minute (protocol copy, Dutch minuut) and issue exemplifications (authentiek afschrift) to the parties. The only fully executed copy, known as the engrossement (grosse), is prima facie demonstrative evidence of its contents, similar to a court order. There is therefore {{no need for the}} party to or custodian of a notarial instrument to provide extraneous evidence to verify the instrument's probativity. And under Dutch law, for instruments to be self-executing they must be drawn up as public instruments, which is why any instrument drafted by a common-law lawyer, which is never public, is not self-executing in the Netherlands.|$|E

40|$|The {{goal of the}} {{instrument}} composition system is to allow a simulation user to dynamically create instruments as a simulation <b>executes.</b> <b>Instruments</b> can include graphical displays, data collectors, and debugging aides. Instruments {{are made up of}} small building blocks which can be easily combined into larger, more complex instruments. Through the sue of an Attribute Server (a distributed publication/subscription mechanism), the actors and instruments in a simulation can interact without direct knowledge of each other. Instead, each actor publishes the attributes which it has available. An instrument subscribes to the attributes in which it is interested, and is notified whenever the value of one of these attribute changes. An instrument can also publish attributes for use by other instruments. Since the Attribute Server is distributed, the publisher of an attribute need not execute on the same machine as the subscriber. This allows CPU intensive data visualization to execute on separate machines from the simulation, minimizing the impact on the simulation...|$|R

It is immaterial whether the quality of legal tender is imparted to such paper. Interest-bearing certificates in denominations up to ten dollars that were issued by loan offices established by the State of Missouri and made receivable in payment of taxes or other moneys due to the State, and in payment of the fees and salaries of state officers, were held to be bills of credit whose issuance was banned by this section. The States are not forbidden, however, to issue coupons receivable for taxes, nor to <b>execute</b> <b>instruments</b> binding themselves to pay money at a future day for services rendered or money borrowed.

40|$|One {{objective}} of the Small Aircraft Transportation System (SATS) Higher Volume Operations (HVO) project {{is to increase the}} capacity and utilization of small non-towered, non-radar equipped airports by transferring traffic management activities to an automated Airport Management Module (AMM) and separation responsibilities to general aviation (GA) pilots. Implementation of this concept required the development of a research Multi-Function Display (MFD) to support the interactive communications between pilots and the AMM. The interface also had to accommodate traffic awareness, self-separation, and spacing tasks through dynamic messaging and symbology for flight path conformance and conflict detection and alerting (CDA). The display served as the mechanism to support the examination of the viability of <b>executing</b> <b>instrument</b> operations designed for SATS designated airports. Results of simulation and flight experiments conducted at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's (NASA) Langley Research Center indicate that the concept, as facilitated by the research MFD, did not increase pilots subjective workload levels or reduce their situation awareness (SA). Post-test usability assessments revealed that pilots preferred using the enhanced MFD to execute flight procedures, reporting improved SA over conventional instrument flight rules (IFR) procedures...|$|R

5000|$|... "An {{acknowledgment}} is {{a formal}} oral declaration before an authorized public officer. It {{is made by}} a person <b>executing</b> signing an <b>instrument</b> who states {{that it was his}} her free act and deed." [...] That is, the person signed it without undue influence and for the purposes detailed in it. A certificate of acknowledgment is a written statement signed (and in some jurisdictions, sealed) by the notary or other authorized official that serves to prove that the acknowledgment occurred. The form of the certificate varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction, but will be similar to the following:Before me, the undersigned authority, on this ______ day of ___________, 20__ personally appeared _________________________, to me well known to be the person who <b>executed</b> the foregoing <b>instrument,</b> and he/she acknowledged before me that he/she executed the same as his/her voluntary act and deed.|$|R
5000|$|Generally, if a pilot determines by {{the time}} the {{aircraft}} is at the decision height (for a precision approach) or missed approach point (for a non-precision approach), that the runway or its environment is not in sight, or that a safe landing cannot be accomplished for any reason, the landing approach must be discontinued (a [...] "go-around") and the missed approach procedure must be immediately initiated. It is also common for pilots to practice a missed approach as part of initial or recurrent instrument training. In such cases, a pilot may <b>execute</b> multiple <b>instrument</b> approaches in a row, with missed approaches between them.|$|R
5000|$|The Catholic Church {{considers}} to have has the right, as {{a perfect}} and independent society provided with all the means for attaining its end, to decide according to its laws disputes arising concerning its internal affairs, especially as to the ecclesiastical rights of its members, also {{to carry out its}} decision, if necessary, by suitable means of compulsion, contentious or civil jurisdiction. This implies the right to admonish or warn its members, ecclesiastical or lay, who have not conformed to its laws, and if needful to punish them by physical means, that is, coercive jurisdiction. The church has the power to judge sin, in the internal forum, but a sin can be at the same time externally a misdemeanour or a crime (delictum, crimen), when threatened with external ecclesiastical or civil punishment. The Church also judges ecclesiastical crimes in the external forum by infliction of penalties, except when the wrongdoing has remained secret. In this case it contents itself, as a rule, with penance voluntarily assumed. A last distinction is to be drawn between necessary jurisdiction and voluntary jurisdiction; the latter contemplates voluntary subjection {{on the part of those}} who seek in legal matters the co-operation of ecclesiastical agencies, e.g. notarially <b>executed</b> <b>instruments,</b> testaments, etc. The judicial power described above, jurisdiction strictly so called, was given by Christ to His Church, was exercised by the Apostles, and transmitted to their successors (Matthew 18:15 sqq.; 1 Corinthians 4:21; 5:1 sqq.; 2 Corinthians 13:10; 1 Timothy 1:20; 5:19 sq.).|$|R

5000|$|Another {{possible}} {{cause of the}} crash discussed by the NTSB in its review of the CVR was that the crew was apparently trying to visually locate the Charlotte airport, while <b>executing</b> an <b>instrument</b> approach {{in the presence of}} low-lying fog. In addition, a persistent attempt to visually identify the nearby Carowinds amusement park tower, known as [...] "Carowinds Tower" [...] to pilots, rising to an elevation of 1314 ft, or 340 ft above ground level (AGL), may have further distracted and confused the flight crew. The first officer (co-pilot) was operating the flight controls, and none of the required altitude callouts were made by the captain, which compounded the flight crew's near total lack of altitude awareness.|$|R

50|$|A common {{criticism}} of the Organ Reform Movement was that its principles were often taken to extremes that became more dogmatic than musical, while ruining many fine symphonic organs and disappointing many listeners.

50|$|However, the {{emergence}} of The Earl of Home as the new Leader of the Conservative Party and his appointment as Prime Minister on 19 October led to a sudden requirement to find him {{a seat in the}} House of Commons.

The same year, a powerful advisory council was established on the insistence of the Federal Government of Pakistan. This body continued to govern Chitral until 1969. The Frontier States of Dir, Chitral and Swat were finally merged through the promulgation of the Dir, Chitral and Swat Administration Regulation of 1969 under General Yahya Khan. The complete takeover of the administration by the Government of Pakistan meant that effectively the states had been extinguished.|$|R
50|$|A {{medallion}} {{signature guarantee}} is a binding warranty, issued by {{an agent of}} the authorized guarantor institution, that: (a) the signature was genuine; (b) the signer was an appropriate person to endorse, and (c) the signer had legal capacity to sign. A medallion signature guarantee is not equivalent to an American Notarial act. One American Notarial act, called an acknowledgment, is a formal declaration made before an authorized public officer (i.e. Notary Public, Judge or Justice). It is made by a person <b>executing</b> an <b>instrument</b> who states it was his “free act and deed”. The three essential components of an acknowledgment are: (a) the personal appearance before an authorized public officer; (b) positive identification; (c) the actual acknowledgment of signing. Unlike medallion signature guarantees, the person executing many legal documents does not have to sign his name in the physical presence of the issuing officer (i.e. Notary Public, Judge or Justice).|$|R
