5|$|A book {{published}} by Nationalmuseum in 1992 on Carl Larsson {{claims that the}} most immediate and natural explanation for the ultimate rejection of the painting {{was the fact that}} time had rendered the painting unfashionable. Because of the long debate, the painting became a survivor <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> past and it could not meet the modernist ideals of the new century.|$|E
5|$|Several of {{the large}} runestones in Scandinavia notify of an inheritance, such as the Hillersjö stone, which {{explains}} how a lady came to inherit the property of not only her children but also her grandchildren and the Högby Runestone, which tells that a girl was the sole heir {{after the death of}} all her uncles. They are important proprietary documents <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when legal decisions were not yet put to paper. One interpretation of the Tune Runestone from Østfold suggests that the long runic inscription deals with the funeral ale in honor of the master of a household and that it declares three daughters to be the rightful heirs. It is dated to the 5th century and is, consequently, the oldest legal document from Scandinavia that addresses a female's right to inheritance.|$|E
5|$|Supporters of the {{original}} doctrine of privity {{say that it is}} reasonable not to allow third parties to enforce contracts, arguing that to allow them to do so would hamper the rights of {{the original}} parties in relation to amending or terminating contracts. Another argument put forward is that the doctrine was deliberately retained by judges to protect consumers from exclusion clauses designed to protect third party manufacturers from liability. The general view of academics, however, is that no legal argument has yet been advanced as to why the original doctrine should be good law. Patrick Atiyah argues that the doctrine came <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> of rising trade through middlemen, and was designed to simplify commercial transactions and encourage enterprise liability.|$|E

5|$|The {{origin of}} the name is unclear as it was not built until long after the reign of King John, who died in 1216. Its present name first {{appeared}} in a 1915 publication, The Heart of Mendip by Francis Knight, when it was being run as a saddler's shop. The royal part of the name {{may have come from}} {{the fact that there was}} a carved king's head on the building, <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when The King's Head Inn occupied part of the premises, but whether this represented King John or another king is not known. The head was attached to one corner of the exterior, but is now inside the building, and a replica placed on the outside.|$|E
5|$|City have {{previously}} worn three other badges on their shirts, {{prior to their}} current badge which was implemented in 2016. The first, introduced in 1970, was based on designs which had been used on official club documentation since the mid-1960s. It consisted of a circular badge which used the same shield as the current badge, inside a circle bearing {{the name of the}} club. In 1972, this was replaced by a variation which replaced {{the lower half of the}} shield with the red rose of Lancashire. On occasions when Manchester City plays in a major cup final, the usual badge has not been used; instead shirts bearing a badge of the arms of the City of Manchester are used, as a symbol of pride in representing the city of Manchester at a major event. This practice originates <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when the players' shirts did not normally bear a badge of any kind, but has continued throughout the history of the club. For the 2011 FA Cup Final, City used the usual badge with a special legend, but the Manchester coat of arms was included as a small monochrome logo in the numbers on the back of players' shirts.|$|E

40|$|We {{performed}} a comprehensive {{analysis on the}} price bounds of CDO tranche options, and illustrated that the CDO tranche option prices can be effectively bounded by the joint distribution of default <b>time</b> (JDDT) <b>from</b> <b>a</b> default <b>time</b> copula. Systemic and idiosyncratic factors beyond the JDDT only contribute {{a limited amount of}} pricing uncertainty. The price bounds of tranche option derived <b>from</b> <b>a</b> default <b>time</b> copula are often very narrow, especially for the senior part of the capital structure where there is the most market interests for tranche options. The tranche option bounds <b>from</b> <b>a</b> default <b>time</b> copula can often be computed semi-analytically without Monte Carlo simulation, therefore it is feasible and practical to price and risk manage senior CDO tranche options using the price bounds <b>from</b> <b>a</b> default <b>time</b> copula only. CDO tranche option pricing is important in a number of practical situations such as counterparty, gap or liquidation risk; the methodology described in this paper can be very useful in the above described situations. ...|$|R

It {{is similar to}} {{standard}} shogi (sometimes called Japanese chess) in its rules and game play. Dai shogi {{is only one of}} several large board shogi variants. Its name means large shogi, <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when there were three sizes of shogi games. Early versions of dai shogi {{can be traced back to}} the Kamakura period, from about AD 1230.

This idea comes <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> when the Metepec area was filled with shallow lakes and marshes. In the main plaza of Metepec, there is a large Tlanchana fountain, created from local clay.|$|E
25|$|Geoffrey Dean has {{suggested}} that the effect may be caused by self-reporting of birth dates by parents rather than any issue with the study by Gauquelin. The suggestion is that a small subset of the parents may have had changed birth times to be consistent with better astrological charts for a related profession. The sample group was taken <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> where belief in astrology was more common. Gauquelin had failed to find the Mars effect in more recent populations, where a nurse or doctor recorded the birth information. The number of births under astrologically undesirable conditions was also lower, indicating more evidence that parents choose dates and times to suit their beliefs.|$|E

25|$|To {{prove the}} antiquity and {{authenticity}} of their claims, the Beta Israel cite the 9th-century CE testimony of Eldad ha-Dani (the Danite), <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> before the Zagwean dynasty was established. Eldad was a Jewish man of dark skin {{who appeared in}} Egypt and created a stir in that Jewish community (and elsewhere in the Mediterranean Jewish communities he visited) with claims {{that he had come}} from a Jewish kingdom of pastoralists far to the south. The only language Eldad spoke was a hitherto unknown dialect of Hebrew. Although he strictly followed the Mosaic commandments, his observance differed in some details from Rabbinic halakhah. Some observers thought that he might be a Karaite, although his practice also differed from theirs. He carried Hebrew books that supported his explanations of halakhah. He cited ancient authorities in the scholarly traditions of his own people.|$|E
25|$|Anlu is a {{traditional}} practice in the Kom communities of the Northwest Region of Cameroon. The practice revolves around groups of women gathering together and engaging in extreme behavior to shame and ostracize individuals who break community morals, such as physical abuse of a pregnant woman or incest. The origin of the practice is said to come <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> the women of Kom communities {{were the only people}} left to defend the towns from an invading force and so dressed as men and caused the opposition army to flee. The traditional practice became relevant with large-scale, political mobilizations by women from 1958 until 1961. This political anlu paralyzed both traditional and colonial administration in the Kom region and disrupted courts, schools, markets, and travel through the region.|$|E
25|$|One of the {{earliest}} styles of mechanical press, these can range from a simple wooden basket with vertical slats and a capstan providing pressure to large hydraulic presses that can even be enclosed to prevent exposure oxygen. An advantage of this style of press is the usually gentle means that it presses the grape but its disadvantages includes the labor intensiveness of its use, small volumes and tendency to provide uneven pressure to {{all parts of the}} cake as well as usually exposing the must to significant amounts of oxygen. Another disadvantage <b>from</b> <b>a</b> <b>time</b> perspective but an advantage in other regards such as gentleness, is that by its nature pressing with a basket press is very slow. Applying too much pressure too rapidly can break the press.|$|E
