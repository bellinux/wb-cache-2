40|$|An {{underground}} steel {{reinforced concrete}} transfer and storage canal {{was built in}} 1943 and operated {{as an integral part}} of the Oak Ridge Graphite Reactor Building (3001) until 1963 when the reactor was shutdown. During operation, the canal was used for under water transfer of irradiated materials and other metals from the reactor in Building 3001 to the Building 3019 hot cell for further processing. After shutdown of the reactor, the canal was used for storage of irradiated materials and fission products until 1990 when the larger materials were removed and stored in the Department of Energy (DOE) approved solid waste management storage facilities. At that time it was discovered that a considerable amount of sludge had accumulated over the intervening years and subsequent analysis showed that the sludge contained Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) materials that violated quantities allowed by the RCRA regulations. It was also recognized in 1990 that the canal was losing water to evaporation and the ground at the rate of approximately 400 gallons per day. To maintain water quality; i. e., radionuclide content at or near DOE derived concentration guidelines (DCG), the water in the canal is constantly demineralized using a <b>demineralizer</b> in the Building 3001 and demineralized make up water is supplied from the Building 3004 <b>demineralizer.</b> This report summarizes the 301 Canal Cleanup Task and the solid waste removed from the 3001 Canal in 1996...|$|E

2500|$|The boiler {{feedwater}} used in {{the steam}} boiler {{is a means of}} transferring heat energy from the burning fuel to the mechanical energy of the spinning steam turbine. The total feed water consists of recirculated [...] condensate water and purified makeup water. Because the metallic materials it contacts are subject to corrosion at high temperatures and pressures, the makeup water is highly purified before use. A system of water softeners and ion exchange <b>demineralizers</b> produces water so pure that it coincidentally becomes an electrical insulator, with conductivity in the range of 0.3–1.0 microsiemens per centimeter. The makeup water in a 500MWe plant amounts to perhaps 120 US gallons per minute (7.6 L/s) to replace water drawn off from the boiler drums for water purity management, and to also offset the small losses from steam leaks in the system.|$|R
40|$|A steam energy {{tip sheet}} for the Advanced Manufacturing Office (AMO). The {{prevention}} of scale formation in firetube boilers {{can result in}} substantial energy savings. Scale deposits occur when calcium, magnesium, and silica, commonly found in most water supplies, react to form a continuous layer of material on the waterside of the boiler heat exchange tubes. Scale creates a problem because it typically possesses a thermal conductivity, {{an order of magnitude}} less than the corresponding value for bare steel. Even thin layers of scale serve as an effective insulator and retard heat transfer. The result is overheating of boiler tube metal, tube failures, and loss of energy efficiency. Fuel consumption may increase by up to 5 % in firetube boilers because of scale. The boilers steam production may be reduced if the firing rate cannot be increased to compensate for the decrease in combustion efficiency. Energy losses as a function of scale thickness and composition are given. Any scale in a boiler is undesirable. The {{best way to deal with}} scale is not to let it form in the first place. Prevent scale formation by: (1) Pretreating of boiler makeup water (using water softeners, <b>demineralizers,</b> and reverse osmosis to remove scale-forming minerals); (2) Injecting chemicals into the boiler feedwater; and (3) Adopting proper boiler blowdown practices...|$|R
30|$|Using MF or UF in {{municipal}} wastewater reuse, especially for RO pretreatment, started to multiply {{in the late}} 1990 s. Nowadays, the integrated utilization of MF and UF with RO has widely available and has reached a standard {{in municipal}} advanced recycled water projects, especially for indirect potable water reuse cases where the recycled water is re-injected to the groundwater aquifer to augment the existing water sources. Historically, petrochemical plants and refineries have used RO as pretreatment for ion exchange <b>demineralizers</b> to produce pure water for boiler feed and process uses. Since 1999, more than ten UF systems have been installed as pretreatment for RO in petrol facilities for boiler feed-water demineralization. RO, {{in the form of}} VSEP (vibratory shear enhancing processing), has also been used in the full scale for removing selenium from stripped sour water to help a large refinery meet stringent discharge requirements. In addition, there are other types of preparing techniques for separating solids and other particles from water which are necessary to reuse it again in drilling and operational performances. These techniques are dilution, filtration, and centrifugation, liquid–liquid extraction (LLE), support-assisted liquid–liquid extraction (Al Dabaj et al. 2018), solid-phase extraction (Oetjen et al. 2017, 2018), and solid-phase micro-extraction (SPME). Dilution serves the purpose of two significant principles: lessen the sample viscosity which plays a vital role on the analysis of water injections and flow backs; in respect of the way, viscosity reduction causes the enhancement of re-productivity. Furthermore, dilution procedures altered the matrixes of the sample and prompted to have more compatibility with further analyzing. Filtration and centrifugation are other kinds of separation for virtually eliminating the particulate components to deal more compatibility with the analytical methodologies. Moreover, filtration processes would not have the ability of dissolved fractional component alteration (Ferrer and Thurman 2015; Mitra 2004; Oetjen et al. 2017, 2018; Rodriguez-Aller et al. 2016; Thurman et al. 2017).|$|R

40|$|It was {{demonstrated}} that the radioactivity content of the primary system of the N. S. Savannah reactor plant was small and normal {{during the period of}} initial criticality and start-up, and during the sea trials and acceptance tests. The principal radioactive constituents (/sup 56 /Mn, /sup 41 /Ar, /sup 13 /N and / sup 18 /F) are either intrinsic to the primary system of the pressurized water reactor or are normally found in the coo 1 ant in concentrations comparable to those observed in this program. The /sup 56 /Mn concentrations observed at the various reactor power levels were slightiy higher, relative to those for the other nuclides, than those observed in similar reactor plants. This slightly increased concentration is attributable {{to the fact that the}} coolant of this reactor was generally maintained between pH 6 and pH 7, whereas the primary coolants of the other plants were maintained at somewhat higher pH values. Data for fission product concentrations in the primary coolant indicate that their only significant source is uranium contamination of the reactor core surfaces. The observed concentrations do not represent any significant hazard or potential difficulty in plant operation. The small value of 5. 6 x 10 /sup - 2 / mu g/cm/sup 2 / for the surface density of uranium indicates that no significant contamination of these surfaces occurred during core fabrication. No significant defect in a fuel element cladding was detected during the period in which these measurements were performed. The efficiency of the <b>demineralizer</b> for removal of anionic and cationic radionuclides from the primary coolant was shown to exceed 90 %. Volatile radionuclides were the only radioactive constituents found in the <b>demineralizer</b> effluent. Data obtained for the concentrations of gross radioactivity in the waste tanks were maintained below the maximum permissible concentrations for discharge to the environment. On the basis of these radiochemistry studies, it may be concluded that the N. S. Savannah primary coolant system exhibited a normal content and distribution of radionuclides and that those plant components for which radioactivity indicators or mon-itors were observed exhibited safe and normal operation behavior.

By lowering the chloride content in kraft liquors, the sticky temperature of recovery boiler deposits can be significantly increased, which should lead to reduced pluggage and boiler down-time. Selectivity of the ion exchanger for chloride is extremely high and recovery of other chemicals such as sodium sulfate, sodium carbonate and sodium hydroxide is demonstrated to be typically 92 - 98 %.

40|$|During {{the report}} period, {{the nature of}} the ORNL {{supporting}} activities gradually changed, reflecting the progress in the conetruction of the N. S. Savannah. Design reviews continued to require considerable attention. The Inspection Engineering Dept. of the Jab. continued to act as an inspection agency for the ALC, witnessing inspections and tests during fabrication of components of the nuclear reactor system. An enviromnental analysis was made of safeguard aspects of operation of the N. S. Savannah at the NYSC site in Cannden. A study of the safety response of the reactor on the ORNL Analog Computer further defined the important role of the Doppler coefficient in controlling reactivity excursions. Health physics aspects of the operation were studied. Limited waste disposal studies indicated that sea disposal of exhausted <b>demineralizer</b> resins may be facilitated by casting the radioactive resins into concrete. Installation of a pressurized-water in-pile test loop in the ORR neared completion. The neutron flux distribution in the loop was determined by experimental measurements in a nuclear mockup of the in-pile section. Metallurgical activities included nil-ductility testing of steel from the reactor vessel, chemical analyses of primary system components, and investigations of the properties of electroless - nickel brazed joints. Limited fabrication studies were carried out on advanced fuel concepts which may have merit for future cores of the Savannah Reactor. Most of the latter effort was applied to swaged UO/sub 2 / rod-type elements. A series of physics calculations is being carried out in an attempt to evaluate the possible advantages of using Zircaloy instead of stainless steel as the structural material for Core III.
