5|$|Although remembered {{primarily}} {{for his role}} in the establishment of the Federal Reserve, Owen worked on a wide range of other issues during his time in the Senate, many of which either reflected the policy agenda of the Progressive Movement or had a direct bearing on the interests of <b>his</b> <b>constituents.</b>|$|E

5|$|Although {{he had not}} {{sought the}} office and was not old enough to serve, Breckinridge was elected to {{represent}} Botetourt County in the Virginia House of Delegates in late 1780. Legend says he was twice refused his seat because of his age, but <b>his</b> <b>constituents</b> reelected him each time, and he was seated the third time, but official records do not support this. His legislative colleagues included Patrick Henry, Benjamin Harrison, John Tyler, John Taylor of Caroline, George Nicholas, Daniel Boone, and Benjamin Logan.|$|E
5|$|Brownlee's {{work as an}} MLA {{extended}} beyond the legislature. He gave close attention to correspondence from <b>his</b> <b>constituents,</b> especially those alleging improper treatment at Ponoka's psychiatric hospital. He prepared thoroughly for speaking engagements in his riding, trying to anticipate all possible questions. These measures were reflected in his support in the largely rural riding, where the Calgary lawyer became a popular and well-respected MLA.|$|E
2500|$|Hayden quickly {{earned a}} {{reputation}} as a [...] "service congressman" [...] who faithfully responded to constituent mail, inserting vegetable or flower seed packets in his replies. Hayden believed that partisanship should end on election day, and <b>his</b> <b>constituent</b> service was performed in a nonpartisan manner.|$|R
50|$|During {{his tenure}} in the House, Driscoll rarely {{sponsored}} legislation, but instead worked behind the scenes. He forged strong ties within his district through <b>his</b> <b>constituent</b> work {{and was considered}} by local Democrats to be unbeatable. In 1992, {{he chose not to}} run for reelection.|$|R
50|$|Elected to the Constituent Assembly of Egypt, Gheriany was {{nominated}} {{president of the}} assembly at its first meeting on 18 June 2012.

In September 2012 the Shura Council appointed Gheriany President of the National Council for Human Rights.|$|R
5|$|The Norfolk and Western Railway {{was one of}} {{the twenty}} railroads which joined Amtrak in 1971 but in the first four years hosted no {{passenger}} service over its route, the centerpiece of which was its main line between Norfolk and Cincinnati which passed through the state of West Virginia. The main driving force behind the establishment of the Mountaineer was then-United States Senator Robert Byrd (D-West Virginia), who wanted additional rail service for <b>his</b> <b>constituents</b> and pressured the Department of Transportation to add the route.|$|E
5|$|U.S. Representative Chet Edwards of Waco, Texas, {{successfully}} {{introduced legislation}} to earmark $150 million toward {{a cure for}} neuroblastoma and other cancers. The measure {{was signed into law}} in July 2008 by U.S. President George W. Bush. Edwards was inspired in the endeavor by the illness and subsequent death of Erin Channing Buenger (1997–2009) of Bryan, daughter of one of <b>his</b> <b>constituents,</b> Walter L. Buenger, head of the history department at Texas A University.|$|E
5|$|Voorhis was a {{conscientious}} congressman towards <b>his</b> <b>constituents,</b> careful to remember births, anniversaries, and in-district events. In fact, {{after the birth}} of Tricia Nixon near the start of the 1946 campaign, Voorhis's office sent the Nixon family a copy of a government publication called Infant Care, of which congressmen received 150 a month. On April 1, 1946, Richard Nixon sent Voorhis a thank you letter for the pamphlet.|$|E
5000|$|In January 2014, Hancock was {{suspended}} from the Liberal Democrats after the party nationally reviewed the report commissioned by Liberal Democrat run Portsmouth City Council which had found [...] "prima facie evidence of his unwelcome sexual approaches" [...] to <b>his</b> <b>constituent.</b> The report, {{which has not been}} officially published, had become available to The Guardian in December 2013.|$|R

5|$|After the war, Johnson {{returned}} to the House of Representatives. The legislature appointed him to the Senate in 1819 to fill the seat vacated by John J. Crittenden. As his prominence grew, his interracial relationship with Julia Chinn, an octoroon slave, was more widely criticized. It worked against his political ambitions. Unlike other upper class leaders who had African American mistresses but never mentioned them, Johnson openly treated Chinn as his common law wife. He acknowledged their two daughters as his children, giving them his surname, much {{to the consternation of}} some of <b>his</b> <b>constituents.</b> The relationship is believed to have led to the loss of his Senate seat in 1829, but his Congressional district returned him to the House the next year.|$|E
5|$|Harper was {{the only}} Reform MP to support the {{creation}} of the Canadian Firearms Registry at second reading in 1995, although he later voted against it at third reading stage. He said {{at the time that he}} initially voted for the registry because of a poll showing that most of <b>his</b> <b>constituents</b> supported it, and added that he changed his vote when a second poll showed the opposite result. It was reported in April 1995, that some Progressive Conservatives opposed to Jean Charest's leadership wanted to remove both Charest and Manning, and unite the Reform and Progressive Conservative parties under Harper's leadership.|$|E
5|$|In 1808, when Congressman Benjamin Parke {{resigned}} from office, Harrison ordered {{a special election}} to fill the vacancy. Jennings entered the race against Harrison's candidate, Thomas Randolph, the attorney general for the territory, and John Johnson, a Vincennes native who {{had the support of}} the antislavery group. Randolph promised not to introduce slavery into the territory unless the majority of <b>his</b> <b>constituents</b> agreed, while Johnson remained silent on the issue. Jennings, an antislavery candidate from the eastern portion of the territory, rode from settlement to settlement to give speeches against slavery. Jennings spoke against what he believed to be Randolph's aristocratic tendencies, ties to Harrison's territorial government, and the issue of slavery in the territory. Jennings found his greatest support among the growing Quaker community {{in the eastern part of}} the territory.|$|E
50|$|Blair {{was known}} for <b>his</b> <b>constituent</b> {{services}} and <b>his</b> efforts to improve Louisiana Highway 1 between Shreveport and Baton Rouge. He also supported highway beautification and personally planted flowers along U.S. Highway 71 near his farm. He opposed having the office of state superintendent of education be made appointive, having explaiend that would prefer the judgment of three million voters, rather than a small group deciding who should hold the top post in education.|$|R
50|$|During Kelly's term in office, his {{political}} views and several appointments generated controversy. In 2004, he rankled fellow Democrats by endorsing and campaigning for President George W. Bush's re-election. According to critics, his conservative views, {{which may have}} been intended to garner support from Republicans and independents, undermined <b>his</b> <b>constituent</b> base in the Democratic Party. An unsuccessful grassroots campaign to recall him was launched shortly after his announcement in support of Bush's re-election effort.|$|R

5|$|In October 2015, The Boston Globe first {{reported}} that Wolf was considering {{not running for}} re-election. Weeks later in November, Wolf confirmed that he would remain in office, but would not seek re-election in 2016. Wolf's political aspirations were prodded shortly after handily winning re-election in 2014, though {{he said he was}} more focused on serving <b>his</b> <b>constituents</b> than considering future office. After rumors that Wolf would not seek re-election in 2016 in order to focus on a run for governor in 2018 began circulating, Senate President Stan Rosenberg suggested it was because Wolf wanted to focus more on running his airline company.|$|E
5|$|In {{his reelection}} as the Second District congressman, Jennings {{supported}} tariff protection and internal improvements {{and vowed to}} support the presidential candidate that <b>his</b> <b>constituents</b> preferred if the election went to the House to decide the winner. Jennings won reelection to Congress in a close race, beating Jeremiah Sullivan of Madison. In the presidential election of 1824 American political parties organized around three candidates: Andrew Jackson running against John Quincy Adams and Henry Clay. Jennings favored Adams, and later, Clay; however, when the contested presidential election passed to the House in 1825, Jennings voted with the majority and gave his political support to Jackson, but he was defeated in the House and Adams became president. Indiana voters who supported Jackson hoped for {{a victory in the}} next election.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the taxation of alcohol spread the burdens of taxation unfairly, especially as concerned <b>his</b> <b>constituents,</b> who included several distillers. He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E
50|$|Gabrielsen {{moved from}} Lindesnes when being elected in 1993, and resided at Østerås. He also kept his {{residential}} address in Spangereid, <b>his</b> <b>constituent</b> district. Towards {{the end of}} his cabinet tenure, he was reported as residing in a yacht at Aker Brygge in Oslo. In 2007 he stood for municipal re-election in Lindesnes, and won a seat. However, as it surfaced that he had recently bought an apartment in Oslo, he had to relinquish the seat.|$|R
60|$|It hadn't {{occurred}} to the Honorable Heth {{to speak to}} <b>his</b> <b>constituent.</b> The ways of Mrs. Duncan sometimes puzzled him, {{and he could not}} see why that lady and her daughter seemed to take more than a passing interest in the girl. But if they could afford to notice her, certainly he could; so he went forward graciously and held out his hand to Cynthia; interrupting Miss Duncan {{in the middle of a}} discourse upon her diary.|$|R
5000|$|Evans {{has been}} criticized for using <b>his</b> <b>constituent</b> service funds to {{purchase}} tickets to sporting events. Such funds are also used to help needy constituents with expected and unexpected expenses, such as funerals. [...] The Washington Post calculated that Evans had spent $135,897 on sporting events and directed $101,564 toward charitable organizations over the previous decade. Evans explained that, as a major advocate of local sports, he used funds for the benefit of Little League Baseball teams and other constituents that cannot afford to attend sports events.|$|R
5|$|When Randall {{returned}} to Washington in 1881 {{to begin his}} term in the 47th Congress, the legislature was controlled by Republicans. After Garfield's assassination later that year, Vice President Chester A. Arthur assumed the presidency. Arthur, like most Republicans, favored high tariffs, but he sought to simplify the tariff structure and to reduce excise taxes. Randall, who had {{returned to}} his seat on the Appropriations Committee, favored the president's plan, and was among the few Democrats in the House to support the it. The bill {{that emerged from the}} Ways and Means Committee, dominated by protectionists, provided for only a 10 percent reduction. After conference with the Senate, the resulting bill had an even smaller effect, reducing tariffs by an average of 1.47 percent. It passed both houses narrowly on March3, 1883, the last full day of the 47th Congress; Arthur signed the measure into law. Toward the end, Randall took less part in the debate, feeling the tension between his supporters in the House, who wanted more reductions, and <b>his</b> <b>constituents</b> at home, who wanted less.|$|E
5|$|While {{serving in}} Congress, Jennings's health {{continued}} to decline {{as he struggled}} with alcohol addiction and suffered from severe rheumatism. In 1827 ceiling plaster from Jennings's Washington D.C. boarding room fell on his head, severely injuring him, and ill health limited his ability to visit <b>his</b> <b>constituents,</b> but he continued to remain a popular politician in Indiana. In the congressional election of 1826, Jennings ran unopposed. He won reelection in 1828, soundly defeating his opponent, Indiana's lieutenant governor, John H. Thompson. Jennings did not publicly favor a presidential candidate and won the Second District seat with support from voters who favored Jackson and Adams. During Jennings's final term in office House journals show that he introduced no legislation, was frequently not present to vote on matters, and only once delivered a speech. Jennings's friends, led by Senator John Tipton, took note of his situation and took action to block Jennings's reelection bid when his drinking became a political liability. John Carr, anti-Jackson man, opposed Jennings in a six-way race for the congressional seat and won the election. Tipton had arranged for others to enter the race and divide Jennings's supporters. Jennings left office on March 3, 1831.|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} term in the legislature, which met in the state capital of Nashville, Johnson did not {{consistently}} vote with either the Democratic or the newly formed Whig Party, though he revered President Andrew Jackson, a Democrat and Tennessean. The major parties were still determining their core values and policy proposals, with the party system {{in a state of}} flux. The Whig Party had organized in opposition to Jackson, fearing the concentration of power in the Executive Branch of the government; Johnson differed from the Whigs as he opposed more than minimal government spending and spoke against aid for the railroads, while <b>his</b> <b>constituents</b> hoped for improvements in transportation. After Brookins Campbell and the Whigs defeated Johnson for re-election in 1837, Johnson would not lose another race for thirty years. In 1839, he sought to regain his seat, initially as a Whig, but when another candidate sought the Whig nomination, he ran as a Democrat and was elected. From that time he supported the Democratic party and built a powerful political machine in Greene County. Johnson became a strong advocate of the Democratic Party, noted for his oratory, and in an era when public speaking both informed the public and entertained it, people flocked to hear him.|$|E
5000|$|Beard {{proved to}} be popular in much of his district, even though almost none of its {{residents}} had previously been represented by a Republican. Indeed, Democrats continued to hold most of the area's seats {{in the state legislature}} well into the 1980s. In part due to taking conservative positions on almost all issues, and in part from <b>his</b> <b>constituent</b> services, Beard was reelected to four subsequent terms. His first reelection coincided with the 1974 nationwide Watergate debacle which ended the careers of many Republicans.|$|R
5000|$|In December 2010, a reply {{he wrote}} to {{a letter from a}} {{constituent}} concerned about the cost of the coming Royal Wedding was published in the press. In it, Russell told <b>his</b> <b>constituent</b> to [...] "get a life and stop whinging". In 2011, he followed this up with another contentious letter to a constituent. Referring to him as a [...] "rubbish man", Russell accused those in support of the Visual Arts Facility (later becoming Firstsite) as [...] "expecting the council to fund their social life".|$|R
5000|$|Lewis {{was known}} for <b>his</b> <b>constituent</b> services. After {{the closure of the}} Fruit of the Loom plant in Campbellsville in Taylor County in 1998, Lewis {{obtained}} $8.5 million earmarked for Kentucky Route 210. [...] "If we had not had that road widened, we would not have secured Amazon.com in Campbellsville" [...] to fill the void in employment, said John Chowning, a Lewis friend and administrator at Campbellsville University. In 2004, Lewis honored the Campbellsville author Betty Jane Gorin-Smith as [...] "historian-laureate" [...] of the Kentucky Heartland region.|$|R
