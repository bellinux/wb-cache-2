Comparing McCarthy to 'Dennis the Menace' of cartoon fame, the Vermonter {{delivered}} a scathing address in which he lambasted the Wisconsin man for dividing the nation. 'In every country in which communism has taken over,' he reminded the Senate, 'the beginning has been a successful campaign of division and confusion.' He marveled {{at the way the}} Soviet Union was winning military successes in Asia without risking its own resources or men, and said this nation was witnessing 'another example of economy of effort...in the conquest of this country for communism.' He added, 'One of the characteristic elements of communist and fascist tyranny is at hand as citizens are set to spy upon each other.' 'Were the junior Senator from Wisconsin in the pay of the communists, he could not have <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job for them.' 'This is a colossal innocence, indeed.'" ...|$|E

500|$|The entire freeway {{road was}} built with {{expansion}} in mind; almost all bridges were built {{wide enough for}} expansion to the ultimate stage which includes {{as many as six}} main travel lanes in one direction, depending on location. [...] Alberta plans to widen the southwest leg of the road, which is well over capacity, but the plans are currently unfunded until at least 2020. [...] They include widening both directions from two to three travel lanes in the congested southwest section between Highway 2 and Whitemud Drive, and the more extensive work required to widen the bridges over the North Saskatchewan River and Wedgewood Ravine which are currently two lanes of travel per bridge each way. [...] In 2015, city councillor Michael Oshry stated that he was unhappy with the way the road was initially constructed, and Alberta should have <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job of anticipating the rapid growth in southwest Edmonton. Project manager Bill van der Meer disagreed, saying, [...] "If we built a six-lane divided road that was virtually empty for 10years, that wouldn’t be money well spent." ...|$|E
500|$|Hex Enduction Hour takes {{influence}} from the Velvet Underground's [...] "Sister Ray", Captain Beefheart {{and the early}} 1970s Krautrock band Can. Smith {{has said that the}} title was intended to invoke witchcraft, that he concocted the word [...] "Enduction" [...] to suggest the album could be a listener's induction into the Fall and that [...] "Hex" [...] was a reference to this being the band's sixth release. His vocals are higher in the mix than on previous Fall releases and were described in 1982 by Sounds as [...] "emerg like a loudhailer from a fog of guitar scratch". The songs were deliberately produced in a raw and low-fi approach by Smith, Grant Showbiz and Richard Mazda in a sound described at the time as a [...] "well produced noise" [...] that was acceptable by Fall standards. Critic Mark Storace claimed that he [...] "could have <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job on a 4-track if I was pissed out of my head". Smith responded by saying that [...] "nowadays people just can't just shut up if they don't know what they're talking about." [...] Elaborating on the purposely amateurish production values, Smith remarked that [...] "it was all recorded in deliberately bad places...deliberately simple sort of thing. Three songs were written at rehearsal and done the next time." ...|$|E
500|$|At the 2014 FINA World Swimming Championships (25 m) in Doha, Qatar, Cielo {{won three}} gold and two bronze medals, into the best Brazilian {{participation}} of all time, {{where the country}} won the competition for the first time.

His rival, the French Florent Manaudou, won the gold beating the world record. Cielo also helped the Brazilian 4 × 50 metre mixed freestyle relay (formed by Cielo, João de Lucca, Etiene Medeiros and Larissa Oliveira) to win the bronze medal, beating the South American record with a time of 1:29.17, only 4 hundredths of Russia, which won the silver medal.

On {{the last day of the}} competition, Cielo won the rematch against Manaudou, in the Men's 100 metre freestyle, where Manaudou was also favorite, but was defeated by Cielo, who won the gold with a time of 45.75. Cielo also closed the competition with a flourish, leading the Brazilian quartet to an unprecedented gold in the traditional Men's 4 × 100 metre medley relay, with a time of 3:21.14, South American record. Cielo took the relay in fourth place and surpassed everyone with an incredible split time of 44.67.|$|E

Warren Spector, former lead designer at Ion Storm, stated it was [...] "not possible to squeeze this much gameplay into a single game" [...] and [...] "no game has <b>done</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> job of showing goals before they can be attained, allowing players to make a plan and execute on it".
