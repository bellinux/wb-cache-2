25|$|Seminoles {{were still}} {{scattered}} {{throughout most of}} Florida. One band that {{had been reduced to}} starvation surrendered in northern Florida near the Apalachicola River in 1842. Further east, however, bands led by Halpatter Tustenuggee, Halleck Tustenuggee and Chitto Harjo raided Mandarin and other settlements along the lower (i.e., northern) St. Johns River. On April 19, 1842, a column of 200 soldiers led by First Lieutenant George A. McCall found a group of Seminole warriors in the Pelchikaha Swamp, about thirty miles south of Fort King. There was a brief fire-fight and then the Seminoles disappeared into a hammock. Halleck Tustenuggee was held prisoner when <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Fort King for a talk. Part of his band was caught when they visited the fort, and Lieutenant McCall captured the rest of Halleck's band in their camp.|$|E
25|$|Lee was {{an early}} {{influence}} on physician and human rights activist H. Jack Geiger. They met in 1940 when Geiger, a 14-year-old middle-class Jewish runaway, was backstage at a Broadway production of Native Son. Lee agreed to take Geiger in when <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> his door in Harlem asking {{for a place to}} stay. With the consent of his parents, Geiger stayed with Lee for over a year. Lee took on the role of surrogate father and introduced Geiger to Langston Hughes, Billy Strayhorn, Richard Wright, and Adam Clayton Powell. Geiger eventually became a journalist, then a doctor who co-founded the first community health center in the United States, Columbia Point Health Center in Dorchester, Massachusetts. He became a founder of Physicians for Social Responsibility and Physicians for Human Rights, and established community health centers in Mississippi and South Africa. Geiger says he would never have moved so deeply in these worlds so quickly if not for his experiences with Canada Lee.|$|E

He says that he [...] "was disgusted and angry. Either I am a member of the party or I'm not. Do I have a different ideology or different politics because I am an Arab Jew? It's segregation, I thought, just like a Negroes' Department. I turned around and walked out. That was the start of my open protests. That same year I organized a demonstration in Ashkelon against Ben-Gurion's racist policies and 10,000 people turned out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lange {{left the}} Fatherland League {{at the end}} of 1938, and joined Landsforeningen Norges Sjøforsvar ("Country Confederation for the Naval Defense of Norway") as its general secretary. The organisation's purpose was to inform about the {{importance}} for Norway of the sea, and thus of the Norwegian navy. Lange continued to travel around the country in order to show films and hold speeches. He agitated for strengthening the Norwegian Armed Forces, and increasingly warned against a possible world war, and how Norway could be pulled into it. Lange was dejected that the authorities did not take him seriously, and left-wing activists continued to disturb his meetings. <b>He</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> the last meeting of the organisation on 6 or 7 April 1940 with a Krag-Jørgensen rifle, telling the audience to [...] "get ready for war," [...] and asking rhetorically when Norway would arm its forces.

Haavardstad in turn responded that Lange should quit [...] "this hysterical defence talk." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lewis {{returned}} to the pop charts with [...] "Me and Bobby McGee" [...] in 1971 and [...] "Chantilly Lace" [...] in 1972, and this turn of events, coupled with a revitalized public interest in vintage rock and roll, inspired Mercury to fly Lewis to London in 1973 to record with a cadre of gifted British and Irish musicians, including Rory Gallagher, Kenney Jones, and Albert Lee. [...] By all accounts the sessions were tense. [...] The remake of Lewis's old Sun cut [...] "Drinking Wine Spo-Dee-O-Dee" [...] would be the album's hit single, reaching number 20 on the Billboard country chart and peaking at number 41 on the pop chart. [...] The Session would be Lewis's highest pop charting album since 1964's Golden Hits of Jerry Lee Lewis, hitting number 37. [...] It did far better on the country albums chart, rising to number 4. [...] Later that same year, he went to Memphis and recorded , a soul-infused rock album produced by Huey Meaux. [...] According to Rick Bragg's authorized 2014 biography, [...] "the Killer" [...] was in a foul mood when <b>he</b> <b>showed</b> <b>up</b> <b>at</b> Trans Maximus Studios in Memphis to record: [...] "During these sessions, he insulted the producer, threatened to kill a photographer, and drank and medicated his way into but not out of a fog." [...] During one exchange that can be heard on the 2013 reissue Southern Roots: The Original Sessions, Meaux asks Lewis, [...] "Do you wanna try one?", meaning a take, to which Lewis replies [...] "If you got enough fuckin' sense to cut it." [...] Lewis was still pumping out country albums, although the hits were beginning to dry up. [...] His last big hit with Mercury was [...] "Middle Age Crazy," [...] which made it to number 4 in 1977.|$|E
