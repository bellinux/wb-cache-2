As he is dead, it is no use talking about <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>would,</b> however, mention {{that he was one of}} the most notorious anti-Semites in the 20th century. He hated Jews so much that he could not look at them; one never wanted to pass him either in the motor pool or anywhere else.|$|E

[...] In an interview with IRIN, Mohamed Bacar said: [...] " [...] Sambi does not know anything concerning the military, but if I had to advise <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say that it's not the solution. The first time [...] the army came we kicked them out. The second time [...] the army came we kicked them out. That means that if they try to come a third time we will kick them out." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Raul Hilberg, Finkelstein {{displays}} [...] "academic {{courage to}} speak the truth when no one else is out there to support <b>him...</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> say that his place in the whole history of writing history is assured, and that those who in the end are proven right triumph, and he will be among those who will have triumphed, albeit, it so seems, at great cost." [...] In a peer review for Beyond Chutzpah, Avi Shlaim said that Finkelstein [...] "has a most impressive track record in exposing spurious American-Jewish scholarship on the Arab-Israeli conflict." [...] He praised Finkelstein for [...] "all the sterling qualities for which he has become famous: erudition, originality, spark, meticulous attention to detail, intellectual integrity, courage, and formidable forensic skills." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{providing}} instrumentation for the record, Kurstin {{used all}} of his instruments, such as a Mellotron and a Chamberlin, taping them from a distance to simulate the Wall of Sound, a recording technique originally developed by Phil Spector that was popular in the early 1960s. He enlisted Clarkson to provide all the background vocals herself. Clarkson, who grew up singing in a choir, {{was pleased with the}} aspect, saying: [...] "Blending is something I knew how to do from childhood. Sometimes I'd have to do an alto instead of a soprano because they needed a bigger sound. But I've never had to do anything like this before—doing all my backup vocals, essentially being my own choir." [...] Together, they began to record in May 2013 and continued through the summer of that year, beginning by recording [...] "White Christmas" [...] with Clarkson in the vocal booth and with Kurstin on a piano. She commented: [...] "The production is all <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be just like 'Hey, can we make this more jazz? Hey, can we make this more bluesy. And he just, like Harry Potter, made this happen. It's so weird." ...|$|E
500|$|New York City doubled for Metropolis, {{while the}} New York Daily News Building {{served as the}} {{location}} for {{the offices of the}} Daily Planet. Brooklyn Heights was also used. Filming in New York lasted five weeks, {{during the time of the}} New York City blackout of 1977. Production moved to Alberta for scenes set in Smallville, with the cemetery scene filmed in the canyon of Beynon, Alberta, the high school football scenes at Barons, Alberta, and the Kent farm constructed at Blackie, Alberta. Brief filming also took place in Gallup, New Mexico, Lake Mead and Grand Central Terminal. Director Donner had tensions with the Salkinds and Spengler concerning the escalating production budget and the shooting schedule. Creative consultant Tom Mankiewicz reflected, [...] "Donner never got a budget or a schedule. He was constantly told he was way over schedule and budget. At one point he said, 'Why don't you just schedule the film for the next two days, and then I'll be nine months over?'." [...] Richard Lester, who worked with the Salkinds on The Three Musketeers and The Four Musketeers, was then brought in as a temporary co-producer to mediate the relationship between Donner and the Salkinds, who by now were refusing to talk to each other. With his relationship with Spengler, Donner remarked, [...] "At one time if I'd seen <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have killed him." ...|$|E

500|$|As a filmmaker, Chaplin is {{considered}} a pioneer {{and one of the}} most influential figures of the early twentieth century. He is often credited as one of the medium's first artists. Film historian Mark Cousins has written that Chaplin [...] "changed not only the imagery of cinema, but also its sociology and grammar" [...] and claims that Chaplin was as important to the development of comedy as a genre as D.W. Griffith was to drama. He was the first to popularise feature-length comedy and to slow down the pace of action, adding pathos and subtlety to it. Although his work is mostly classified as slapstick, Chaplin's drama A Woman of Paris (1923) was a major influence on Ernst Lubitsch's film The Marriage Circle (1924) and thus played a part in the development of [...] "sophisticated comedy". According to David Robinson, Chaplin's innovations were [...] "rapidly assimilated to become part of the common practice of film craft." [...] Filmmakers who cited Chaplin as an influence include Federico Fellini (who called Chaplin [...] "a sort of Adam, from whom we are all descended"), Jacques Tati ("Without <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> never have made a film"), René Clair ("He inspired practically every filmmaker"), Michael Powell, Billy Wilder, Vittorio De Sica, and Richard Attenborough. Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky praised Chaplin as [...] "the only person to have gone down into cinematic history without any shadow of a doubt. The films he left behind can never grow old." ...|$|E
500|$|James Arnold Taylor was Tidus' English-language voice. Taylor {{was offered}} the role by voice {{director}} Jack Fletcher (who believed that he would fit the character), and translator Alexander O. Smith explained Tidus to him. In contrast to Morita, Taylor made the character friendlier and less serious with the staff's approval. After recording Final Fantasy X, Taylor {{said that he would}} enjoy voicing Tidus again; the character was [...] "like an old friend to me now. I know so much more about him now than I did when we first started, knowing hardly anything about <b>him.</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> really hate it if anybody else voiced him". Recording the game took Taylor three-and-a-half months, and he enjoyed the experience. According to Taylor, it would be unrealistic for Tidus to hide emotion. He said that although there were things he would change about his performance (such as the scene where Tidus and Yuna begin laughing together), he was grateful for the warm fan reception of his work. Smith felt that the forced-laugh scene was adapted well from the original Japanese scene, because of how [...] "stilted and out of place" [...] it was in the original version. Smith was confused by Morita and Mayuko Aoki's performance, but after discussing it with Nojima he found it well done in both languages and called it [...] "awkward" [...] and [...] "funny". When Final Fantasy X was re-released in 2013, Taylor said that he was proud to be Tidus' voice.|$|E

[...] "But I told <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do it only if I also published commentaries". Spitzer later recanted the study's conclusions.|$|E

2500|$|Banville {{has said}} that he imitated James Joyce as a boy: [...] "After I'd read the Dubliners, and was struck at the way Joyce wrote about real life, I {{immediately}} started writing bad imitations of the Dubliners." [...] However, The Guardian reports: [...] "Banville himself has acknowledged that all Irish writers are followers of either Joyce or Beckett – and he places himself in the Beckett camp." [...] He has also acknowledged other influences. During a 2011 interview on The Charlie Rose Show, Rose asked, [...] "The guiding light has always been Henry James?" [...] and Banville replied, [...] "I think so, I mean people say, you know, I've been influenced by Beckett or Nabokov but it's always been Henry James [...] so I would follow <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> be a Jamesian." ...|$|E

2500|$|The soundtrack for Days of Heaven is {{a strong}} {{reflection}} of the film's context. Ennio Morricone provided the film's score and received his first Academy Award nomination in his soundtrack composing career {{for his work on}} the film. Morricone recalled the process as being [...] "demanding" [...] and said of Malick: [...] "He didn't know me very well, so he made suggestions, and in some cases, gave musical solutions. This kind of annoyed me because he'd say: 'This thing [...] [...] [...] try it with three flutes.' Something impossible! So, to humor <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> do it with three flutes and then he'd decide to use my version after all. His was impossible or I would have written it myself. And more nitpicking like that which means he was very attentive and careful about music." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of January I delivered a small piece thereof to John Baptista Agnello, not telling what nor from whence, but prayed him to prove what metal was therein. And within three days I came to him for answer. He showed me a very little powder of gold, saying it came thereout, and willed me to give him another piece {{to make a better}} proof. [...] I did so, and within three days again he showed me more powder of gold. [...] I told <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> not believe it without better proof. He asked another piece to make a better proof, saying that he would make anatomy thereof. I gave it him saying that I marvelled much of his doings sith I had given pieces to other 3 to make proof who could find no such thing there. He answered me, Bisogna sapere adulare la natura.|$|E

Marty Shea, the booking agent for the Columbia, came to me and asked if I wanted to play burlesque. They could use an extra attraction....I told <b>him</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> think about it, but 'Burlesque' sounded to me then as something funny." [...] Shea and Sam A. Scribner, the general manager of the Columbia Amusement Company, approached Rogers a few days later. Shea told Scribner Rogers was getting $150 and would take $175.

2500|$|A third enemy plane {{appeared}} in my ‘10 o’clock’, {{from the right}} to the left: in simple words, almost in the opposite direction. [...] The first MiG zoomed away and I engaged the afterburner to get in an attack position against this new enemy. [...] I reared up my aircraft in a 45 degree angle, inside his turn. [...] He was turning to the left, so I pulled the stick and barrel-rolled to the right. [...] Thanks to this maneuver, I found myself above him, half upside down. [...] I held it until the MiG finished his turn, calculating the time so that, if I could keep on turning behind <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> get on his tail, with a deflection angle of 20 degrees, {{at a distance of}} 1,500 yards. [...] That was exactly what happened. [...] He never saw me. [...] Behind and lower than him, I could clearly see his silhouette against the sun when I launched two Sidewinders. One of them impacted and tore apart his right wing.|$|E
2500|$|As the French advanced, the English {{launched}} their charge. Stunned by the attack, the impetus carried the English and Gascon forces {{right into the}} French line. Simultaneously, de Buch's mobile reserve of mounted troops fell upon the French left flank and rear. Fearful of encirclement, the cohesion of the French army disintegrated as many soldiers attempted to flee the field. Low on arrows, the English and Welsh archers abandoned their bows and ran forward to join the melée. Around this time, King John and his son, Philip the Bold, found themselves surrounded. As written by Froissart, an exiled French knight fighting with the English, Sir Denis Morbeke of Artois approached the king, requesting the King's surrender. The King {{is said to have}} replied, [...] "To whom shall I yield me? Where is my cousin the Prince of Wales? If I might see <b>him,</b> <b>I</b> <b>would</b> speak with him".
