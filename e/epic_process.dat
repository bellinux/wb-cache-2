The world and the current film market just wasn't ready for such an elaborate take on the HR universe. We aimed so very high in every single aspect of this feature but alas perhaps we aimed too high. HRO would have shocked, elated, thrilled and amazed its audience, I fully believe that but alas the studios and press did not get behind us. So to hell with them. Only the fans got behind us and I thank you all. The creative HUB created from this <b>epic</b> <b>process</b> will never be tamed, we will be back one way or another. With a vengeance! I thank you all for your support and dedication. I have been taken to the heights of elation producing, creating this beast, crushed with disappointment at its failure to find its ground. Its took me a long while to get back to normal, whatever normal is but expect dark, hell to surface from me again.

5000|$|In an April 2014, {{interview}} with TV Guide, executive producer Matt Selman spoke {{about how long}} it took to produce the episode, saying: [...] "We've literally been at this thing for two years — twice {{the time it takes to}} do one of our regular episodes — and that's way too long for comedy people to live with the same jokes. It's been an <b>epic</b> <b>process.</b> First, we had to convince producer Jim Brooks and our showrunner, Al Jean, that a Lego episode was a great idea and not just an excuse for our staff of nerds who grew up in the '70s to crack Lego jokes. There needed to be a real emotional story there." [...] The Simpsons staff also had to have the approval of the Lego company. [...] "We're pretty picky about how our brand is represented, and The Simpsons, which is so famous for its satire, has its own distinct point of view," [...] said Jill Wilfert, the Lego Group's vice president of licensing and entertainment. [...] "No one at the show is used to dealing with creative input from the outside, so there was certainly some back-and-forth to get it all right. But, at its core, the Lego brand is all about creativity and imagination. We respect that in others." [...] Wilfert also spoke about how the episode is edgier than most Lego properties, saying that it was [...] "a chance for us to be a little edgier than we might normally be. And because we'll likely bring younger viewers to The Simpsons, it was an opportunity for them to be more family-friendly." ...|$|E
40|$|The {{benefits}} of introducing active learning in college science courses are well established, yet {{more needs to}} be understood about student buy-in to active learning and how that process of buy-in might relate to student outcomes. We test the exposure–persuasion– identification–commitment (<b>EPIC)</b> <b>process</b> model of buy-in, here applied to student (n = 245) engagement in an undergraduate science course featuring active learning. Student buy-in to active learning was positively associated with engagement in self-regulated learning and students’ course performance. The positive associations among buy-in, self-regulated learning, and course performance suggest buy-in as a potentially important factor leading to student engagement and other student outcomes. These findings are particularly salient in course contexts featuring active learning, which encourage active student participation in the learning process...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{we focus}} on the epic {{character}} of Reyes' translation of the Iliad. Comparing his version with the original, we analyse how the translator represents formal epical elements, such as the metre, the formulas and repeated scenes. We find, on the one hand, that Reyes does not literally reproduce the epic elements of the Greek original, which results in a reduction of the epical character of his translation. On the other hand, he adopts the principles of epic composition and applies them independently from the original to his own work. This way, he reinforces the epic nature of his translation. Consequently, his faithfulness to the original surpasses the first literal layer and reaches the more fundamental level of the genre. We therefore argue that Reyes is not just a translator but turns into an autonomous epic poet. While translators usually remain truthful to a text by reproducing style elements literally, Reyes proves his loyalty to the Iliad precisely in the parts where he deviates from the original text by applying classic <b>epic</b> <b>processes</b> in a personal, creative and independent way...|$|R

40|$|Romanzo Criminale {{is one of}} the few recent Italian media {{products}} that has emerged as a societal phenomenon and as a vehicle for the exportation of a national culture. It is a complex narrative which extends in time and space due to its various adaptations and intermedial crossovers. Following the path of complexity, drawing on Edgar Morin’s work, Romanzo Criminale will be thought of as a complex system. As precedent studies on the intertwining of official and grassroots discourses show, Romanzo Criminale becomes a complex world, with its boundaries and internal organization. This paper will show that Romanzo Criminale can be studied as a semiosphere (Lotman 2005), or a semiotic space defined by and which encourages the intertwining of texts and audience appropriations, creating an <b>epic</b> <b>process.</b> Some methodological perspectives used for mapping this phenomenon will be discussed, namely Franco Moretti’s distant reading...|$|E

As is often the case when working with the Iliad and Odyssey, the discussion is broader in focus than is currently the norm for academic theses. In this instance a wide-ranging scope is necessary, since the purpose is to identify patterns concerning ownership and plunder in the <b>epics.</b> The <b>process</b> of extrapolating the depictions of life in the Homeric epics to the conditions and realities of Archaic Greece is achieved most effectively by ascertaining unified portrayals of concepts as opposed to minutely analyzing singular occurrences in the works [...] ...|$|R
40|$|Literary {{criticism}} in the 2 ̆ 7 Information Age 2 ̆ 7 requires a theory and a theoretical language compatible with the post-modern interdisciplinary educational communication. It seems that Systems Theory fulfills such expectation. Accordingly, society is an autopoietic system comprised of four aspects: structure, function, process and purpose. It is established {{on the principle of}} system/environment difference, structured on communication, functions as the processor of societal information for the purpose of reducing the environmental complexities. It allocates its tasks to subsystems which are differentiated internally from the society as a whole and from each other: polity, religion, knowledge, economy and art. Each subsystem operates according to its own communication codes. The subsystem of art communicates its information according to the experience-code of 2 ̆ 7 beauty 2 ̆ 7, action-code of 2 ̆ 7 love 2 ̆ 7 and control mechanism-code of 2 ̆ 7 taste 2 ̆ 7. In doing so it divides the internal domain of society into two distinct groups: authors and audience. It also allocates the tasks of processing and communication of information to its internally differentiated sub-subsystems: temporal art, spatial art and spatio-temporal art or verbal art known as literature. Verbal art uses language as its structure or medium of communication. It processes information which refer to three types of system conflict: (1) conflict of right with wrong arising from system/environment difference; (2) conflict of right with right arising from system-internal differences; (3) conflict of right as wrong with wrong as right arising from system 2 ̆ 7 s self-reflection. Allocation of processing of each type of conflict constitutes generic differentiation within verbal art: literary genres are born. <b>Epic</b> <b>processes</b> the first type, drama the second type and lyric the third type. A fourth genre, novel, processes a combination of the three types. Persian lyrics as observational data provide a clear example of structural, functional, processual and teleological specificity the lyric genre-acquires in order to operate successfully and continuously. ...|$|R
40|$|This study hypothesizes {{that process}} drama {{can enhance the}} acting skills of {{undergraduate}} acting students. Not only is process drama effective in teaching acting skills in general; it is adaptable to teaching those particular skills required by alternative forms such as <b>epic</b> theatre. <b>Process</b> drama is an episodic form of improvisation that is initiated through the given circumstances of a pre-text and develops {{over an extended period}} of time. The quantitative pretest-posttest procedure of this study involved dividing a class of beginning acting students into two groups: traditional and experimental. The learning objectives remained the same for both groups; the only variation was in the teaching techniques. Students were pretested by the primary investigator at the beginning of the semester, to establish a base-line in the six assessed skill categories: speech, physicalization, listening, concentration, clarity of action and energy. At the end of the study, two external evaluators participated in the posttest to ensure reliability and validity of the results. The results showed in that in four of the six categories (physicalization, clarity, concentration and listening), skills were improved in the experimental group, to a significantly greater extent than in the traditional group. In one category (energy) the results were about even; had the study group been larger, the experimental group would have shown significantly more improvement. In the sixth category (speech), it was the traditional group that showed more improvement. The results indicate that the potential is great and deserves further exploration and development. Of particular importance is the need for case studies which can assist acting teachers in formulating their own approach to using process drama in the classroom...|$|R
40|$|Queueing Network-Model Human Processor (QN-MHP) is a {{computational}} {{architecture that}} integrates two complementary approaches to cognitive modeling: the queueing network approach and the symbolic approach (exemplified by the MHP/GOMS family of models, ACT-R, EPIC, and SOAR). Queueing networks are particularly suited for modeling parallel activities and complex structures. Symbolic models have particular strength in generating a person’s actions in specific task situations. By integrating the two approaches, QN-MHP offers an architecture for mathematical modeling and generating in real-time concurrent activities in a truly concurrent manner. QN-MHP expands the three discrete serial stages of MHP into three continuoustransmission subnetworks of servers, each performing distinct psychological functions specified with a GOMSstyle language. Multitask performance emerges as {{the behavior of}} multiple streams of information flowing through a network, with no need to devise complex, task specific procedures to either interleave production rules into a serial program (ACT-R) or for an executive process to interactively control task <b>processes</b> (<b>EPIC).</b> Using QN-MHP, a driver performance model was created and interfaced with a driving simulator to perform a vehicle steering and a map reading task concurrently and in real time.

40|$|Recent {{observations}} from spaceborne microwave sensors have revealed detailed {{structure of the}} surface flow over the equatorial eastern Pacific in the boreal fall season. A marked acceleration of surface wind across the northern sea surface temperature (SST) front of the cold tongue is a prominent feature of the regional climate. Previous studies have attributed the acceleration {{to the effect of}} enhanced momentum mixing over the warmer waters. A high-resolution numerical model is used to examine the cross-frontal flow adjustment. In a comprehensive comparison, the model agrees well with many observed features of crossequatorial flow and boundary layer structure from satellite, Tropical Atmosphere Ocean (TAO) moorings, and the recent Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate <b>Processes</b> (<b>EPIC)</b> campaign. In particular, the model simulates the acceleration across the SST front, and the change from a stable to unstable boundary layer. Analysis of the model momentum budget indicates that the hydrostatic pressure gradient, set up in response to the SST gradient, drives the surface northward acceleration. Because of thermal advection by the mean southerly flow, the pressure gradient is located downstream of the SST gradient and consequently, divergence occurs over the SST front, as observed by satellite. Pressure gradients also act to change the vertical shear of the wind as the front is crossed. However, the model underpredicts the changes in vertical win...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposed}} {{research is}} {{a contribution to}} <b>EPIC</b> 2001, a <b>process</b> study designed to improve understanding and modeling of seasonal-to-decadal climate variability over the eastern tropical Pacific. EPIC 2001 (Eastern Pacific Investigation of Climate Processes in the Coupled Ocean-Atmosphere System 2001) is an activity of the U. S. CLIVAR Program. EPIC 2001 consists of four components focusing on (a) intertropical convergence zone/warm-pool phenomena, (b) cross-equatorial inflow into the intertropical convergence zone, (c) upper ocean structure and mixing, and (d) an exploratory study of boundary layer cloud properties in the southeasterly tradewind regime. The field phase of EPIC 2001 is scheduled for a 6 week period during the interval July-September 2001. The work proposed for the intertropical convergence zone/warm pool region asks four questions: (1) What mechanism or set of mechanisms forces convection in the east Pacific ITCZ? (2) What factors {{are responsible for the}} fluctuations in strength and position of the east Pacific ITCZ on weekly time scales? (3) How do the characteristics of ITCZ convection vary through the diurnal cycle? (4) What are the distributions of longwave and shortwave radiative fluxes at the ocean surface, the latent and sensible heat fluxes out of the ocean, the precipitation rate, and the wind stress curl in various conditions? Answering these questions will tell us how the atmospheric convection in the east Pacific ITCZ/warm pool work...|$|R
40|$|Cloud {{properties}} are usually {{assumed to be}} homogeneous within the cloudy part of the grid-box, i. e. subgrid-scale inhomogeneities in cloud cover and/or microphysical {{properties are}} often neglected. However, precipitation formation is initiated by large particles. Thus mean values are not representative and {{could lead to a}} delayed onset of precipitation. For a more physical description of the subgrid-scale structure of clouds we introduce a new statistical sub-column algorithm to study the impact of cloud inhomogeneities on stratiform precipitation. Each model column is divided into N independent sub-columns with sub-boxes in each layer, which are completely clear or cloudy. The cloud cover is distributed over the sub-columns depending on the diagnosed cloud fraction. Mass and number concentrations of cloud droplets and ice crystals are distributed randomly over the cloudy sub-columns according to prescribed probability distributions. Shapes and standard deviations of the distributions are obtained from aircraft observations. We have implemented this sub-column algorithm into the ECHAM 5 global climate model to take subgrid variability of cloud cover and microphysical properties into account. Simulations with the Single Column Model version of ECHAM 5 were carried out for one period of the Mixed-Phase Polar Arctic Cloud Experiment (MPACE) campaign {{as well as for the}} Eastern Pacific Investigation of climate <b>Processes</b> (<b>EPIC)</b> campaign. Results with the new algorithm show an earlier onset of precipitation for the EPIC campaign and a higher conversion of liquid to ice for the MPACE campaign, which reduces the liquid water path in better agreement with the observations than the original version of the ECHAM 5 model...|$|R

O estudo abrange os aspectos românticos do registro dos poemas orais que hoje formam a epopéia, seu processo de publicação, suas conexões com a história factual da Finlândia, sua difusão pelo mundo na forma de traduções, bem como sua onipresença no universo de cultura de massa de seu país. Abordamos, ainda, os paralelos que podem ser traçados entre as obras que influenciaram a Kalevala e aquelas que o épico influenciou, de forma a constituir uma rede discursiva e aproximar o texto dos leitores brasileiros. Como aporte teórico no tocante ao Romantismo se fazem presentes as análises de Victor HUGO (2004) e Jacob GUINSBERG (2005), na reflexão entre literatura, história e memória temos como referência as obras de Eric HOBSBAWM (2002), Benedict ANDERSON (1989) e Maurice HALBWACHS (2006), além de diversos historiadores finlandeses.

40|$|Abstract Ayyār that named {{with some}} other titles like Feta, Javanmard and Akhi {{is one of the}} most {{important}} and impressive motives of Iran’s history. Maybe the forming time of Ayyār goes back to Sassanid age or before this era. The word of Ayyār likes the other resembling its samples has two different meanings (good and bad). In awful, means thief, pitiless and…, in good meaning is a generous, kind and brave person who helps people in problems. Ayyāri as a social movement from preIslamic period to after this time have passed very different conditions and its rituals extended into many literary and unliterary materials and in literary materials have been considered in two <b>processes</b> (<b>epic</b> texts and mystical instructions called Fotowatname). Ayyāri customs and beliefs divided into parts of moral principles and abilities. Using these customs and beliefs, this paper has attempted to prove that Noofel in Leili va Mjnoon is an Ayyār. Leili va Mjnoon is a description of love between Qeis, son of Amer, and Leili but Arabic fanaticism made obstacles between them. At last Leili’s father made her marry to another person named ‘Ibn Salam’, and Qeis didn’t get married until his death. Before Ebn Salam’s marriage, Noofel endeavored to help Qeis by fighting against Leili’s father tribe but finally abandoning from this deed. In the end, Leili died and afterwards Majnoon died beside her grave. Many researchers studied Leili va Mjnoon though neither of them didn’t pay attention to Noofel's character and his deeds, so if students ask any question about it, we don’t have any suitable answer to prove that Noofel is an Ayyār. This necessity leads to prove this theory. In Leili va Mjnoon, Nezami introduced Noofel character with qualified Ayyāri adjectives: Kindness, being experienced and courageous, a wealthy person who didn’t steal. Noofel swore to help Mjnoon even this action ended to his death. In this process, Noofel didn’t have any expectation from Mjnoon. Swear wine (in Persian called “Shadnooshi”) as a symbol of brotherhood treaty and Ayyār’s storytelling ability and tradition of eating fellowships with together were the important Ayyār’s rituals that we found these signs in Noofel’s story. Ayyārān as a moral population always have a collective life and leader of them named “Ostad” that the others obey him, this condition obviously exist in Noofel’s story. In this story, Nizami signed to Ayyār’s black wear (called Shabravi Shirt) over and over. Of the other Ayyār’s abilities that found in Noofel’s story is Ayyār’s opportunism or cleverness. Noofel in the first battle against Leili’s father tribe disclosed this ability, when he understood that couldn’t fight with the other Leili’s tribe, pretended to peace and afterwards when he could become stronger fight again. The most important part of Noofel’s story when disclosed that he defeat Leili’s father tribe in war, Noofel could give Leili to Mjnoon obligatory but didn’t do this...|$|R
