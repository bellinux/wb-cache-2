30|$|An {{important}} {{finding of}} the study is that the interventions <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> impact on the entrepreneur identity aspiration of the participants.

5|$|The primary {{treatment}} of schizophrenia is antipsychotic medications, often {{in combination with}} psychological and social supports. Hospitalization may occur for severe episodes either voluntarily or (if mental health legislation allows it) involuntarily. Long-term hospitalization is uncommon since deinstitutionalization beginning in the 1950s, although it still occurs. Community support services including drop-in centers, visits by members of a community mental health team, supported employment and support groups are common.

5|$|This {{approach}} {{demonstrates the}} effects of gender inequalities by enhancing macroeconomic models. Bernard Walters shows that traditional neoclassical models fail to adequately assess work related to reproduction by assuming that the population and labor are determined exogenously. That fails {{to account for the}} fact that inputs are produced through caring labor, which is disproportionately performed by women. Stephen Knowels et al. use a neoclassical growth model to show that women's education <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> statistically significant effect on labor productivity, more robust than that of men's education. In both of these cases, economists highlight and address the gender biases of macroeconomic variables to show that gender plays a significant role in models' outcomes.|$|E

40|$|SummaryBackgroundPrevention of {{tuberculosis}} (TB) in the United States usually involves testing for latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) with a tuberculin skin test (TST), followed by offering therapy {{to those who}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> test result. QuantiFERON-TB Gold assay (QFT-G) is more specific for infection with Mycobacterium tuberculosis than the TST, especially among persons vaccinated with bacillus Calmette-Guérin, thereby {{reducing the number of}} false positive tests. MethodsAdults referred to a pulmonary clinic for <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> TST result were tested with QFT-G. We assessed factors for <b>having</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> QFT-G. ResultsAmong 100 adults who were BCG-vaccinated and <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> TST result, 30 (30 %) <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> result using QFT-G. Persons from high-incidence countries were 8. 2 times more likely to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>positive</b> QFT-G result compared with persons from low-incidence countries (46 % versus 9 %). Using logistic regression to assess QFT-G positivity, strong predictors included <b>having</b> <b>an</b> abnormal chest radiograph consistent with healed TB, a TST induration of ≥ 16 mm, and birth in a high-incidence country.
