Background Silicon carbide (SiC) is attracting attention as a new semiconductor material expected to replace silicon (Si) material. SiC enables the fabrication of low-resistance, high-voltage power devices surpassing Si power devices.

In parallel, Mitsubishi Electric has also been developing application technologies such as employing SiC power devices in inverter applications, and has demonstrated improved efficiency and downsizing of the equipment. The SiC unipolar devices are also applicable to industrial and railway vehicle power modules, which require an even higher <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage.</b> Mitsubishi Electric has integrated SiC-SBDs and Si insulated-gate bipolar transistors (Si-IGBTs) to fabricate a prototype hybrid SiC module with a 3. 3 -kV <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage,</b> and demonstrated its 1. 5 kV / 2 kA switching operation.

40|$|This thesis {{concentrates}} on building a power UMOSFET on SiC. The major {{problem of the}} Conventional UMOSFET is that the bottom trench oxide breaks down before avalanche breakdown occurs in the SiC. This restricts the full usage of the SiC high avalanche field property. A novel structure Protected UMOSFET for protecting the bottom trench oxide and increasing <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage</b> is analyzed. Simulation shows that the protected UMOSFET increases the <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage</b> but also increases the on-resistance as it introduces a JFET resistance. A trade-off problem exists for designing the trench depth: if the trench is too deep, the protection effect is lost, if too shallow, on-resistance increases or pinch-off happens. Another novel structure, called Optimized UMOSFET, is proposed to solve this trade-off problem. Simulation shows the Optimized UMOSFET {{not only has the}} ideal <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage</b> but also lower on-resistance than the conventional UMOSFET. Some design issues as well as fabrication issues are discussed. Actual device fabrication shows a low inversion layer mobility. The low inversion layer mobility is partially avoided by using an Accumulation Layer in the channel. Measurement results of the Conventional UMOSFET, Protected UMOSFET, Optimized UMOSFET, and Accumulation Layer Optimized UMOSFET are presented along with detail discussions. Nearly ideal <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage</b> is achieved in real devices, and the forward on-resistance is 20 times lower than theoretical Si devices designed with the same <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage.</b> In order to get the theoretical SiC performance, channel mobility needs further improvement. Future research is suggested to push the power UMOSFET to its SiC theoretical limit. ...|$|R

Additionally, MOSFET resistance is typically lower for smaller <b>blocking</b> <b>voltages,</b> so the choice between IGBTs and power MOSFETS will depend on both the <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage</b> and current involved in a particular application.|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In many {{pulse power}} {{applications}} {{there is a}} trend to modulators based on semiconductor technology. For these modulators high voltage and high current semiconductor switches are {{required in order to}} achieve a high pulsed power. Therefore, often high power IGBT modules or IGCT devices are used. Since these devices are based on bipolar technology the switching speed is limited and the switching losses are higher. In contrast to bipolar devices unipolar ones (e. g. SiC JFETs) basically offer a better switching performance. Moreover, these devices enable high <b>blocking</b> <b>voltages</b> in case large bandgap materials as SiC are used. At the moment SiC JFET devices with a <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage</b> of 1. 5 kV per JFET are available. Alternatively, the operating voltage could be increased by connecting N JFETs and a low voltage MOSFET in series resulting in a Super Cascode switch with a <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage</b> N-times higher than the <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage</b> of a single JFET. In order to evaluate the achievable switching speed of the Super Cascode and its applicability in solid state modulators, the performance of such a SiC switch is examined in this paper. Furthermore, the performance of the Super Cascode is compared with 4. 5 kV IGBTs made by Powerex, which are mounted in a special low inductive housing for minimising the rise and fall times. I...|$|R
40|$|Thyristors able {{to block}} 4 kV have been {{fabricated}} and characterised. The experimental forward current is 1. 3 A @ V-AK = 10 V for a 9 mA gate current during 550 ns. The device active area is 2. 3 mm(2). The devices and their edge terminations {{have been designed}} using numerical simulations. Two different edge terminations have been envisaged (mesa and a combination of mesa and JTE). A SiO 2 passivation layer also improves the forward <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage</b> depending on the sign and {{the magnitude of the}} effective charge density in the oxide. The mesa protection is not enough to allowing the thyristor to block 5 kV, due to the low etching rate in SiC. Thus, a mesa/JTE protection has been used. The influence of the etching depth, the JTE dose and length on the forward <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage</b> of the thyristor has been studied in details. Simulation results have allowed designing the devices, not far from the optimal structure. The best results of the forward <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage</b> are 4 kV for the mesa protected thyristor, while the mesa/JTE combination yields 3. 6 M Furthermore, experimental results confirm the simulations concerning the influence of the oxide thickness on the forward <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage.</b> The better results for the mesa protected thyristor are due to a lower interface SiC/SiO 2 charge density provided by the different oxidation processes (at different foundries). In addition, the comparison between experiments and simulations allows estimate the effective charge density of the SiO 2 layer in 10 (12) - 5 x 10 (12) cm(- 2) range for the two fabricated thyristors. The improvement in the forward <b>blocking</b> <b>voltage</b> must pass through an improvement of the passivation layer.
