40|$|Objective: This study aims to {{identify}} the knowledge, attitude, and behavior of students using eight indicators of Clean and Healthy Living Behavior (CHLB) {{in relation to the}} health education and grade levels in Islamic Boarding Schools (IBS) in Jember regency, East Java Province, Indonesia. Methods: A cross-sectional school-based survey design was used. About 114 students (mean age of 13. 17 years old) selected through a multi-stage random sampling completed a self-administered questionnaire to measure the eight indicators of CHLB, such as washing hands with running water and soap, eating healthy snacks, using clean and healthy latrines, exercising regularly and measurably, eradicating mosquito larvae, not smoking at school, weighing and height measurement every 6 months, and disposing garbage properly. The data analyses included descriptive and comparative analyses of the difference in knowledge, attitude, and behavior toward CHLB by health education and grade level. Results: About 66. 7 % students received health education. Significant knowledge in CHLB in relation to health education and grade was observed (P¬†<¬†. 05), including in-depth knowledge of exercises, measurable weight and height, smoking, and healthy latrines. Meanwhile, no significant difference was observed between the attitude toward CHLB and health education in different grade levels. Furthermore, CHLB was associated with health education, including habitual exercise and using of clean and healthy latrines. Conclusions: Knowledge, attitude, and behavior toward CHLB differ with health education and grade level. Thus, IBS can promote personal hygiene practice and <b>environmental</b> <b>sanitations</b> for the prevention of diseases in school-based environments...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{evaluates the}} {{magnitude}} of the challenges associated with <b>Environmental</b> Education and <b>Sanitation</b> in the urban centres of Kano region (presently Kano and Jigawa states). Kano metropolis, Dambatta, Gwarzo, Bichi, Rano, and Wudil are government recognized urban centres in Kano state. While in Jigawa state are Hadejia, Gumel, Kazaure, Birnin Kudu, and Dutse. The method used include: FGD. In-depth Interviews, Case Study Inventory, and Direct field measurement with the aid of Noise Level Metre, Ambient Air Quality Analyser, and GPS. The result shows that <b>Environmental</b> Education and <b>Sanitation</b> are well conceived but arbitrarily operated with little or no strong attachment to ethical tie; which would not only negate sustainable urban development but also hamper adequate implementation of environmental management processes in the region. It is therefore, recommended that both Kano and Jigawa States should develop the necessary skills and expertise to address environmental challenges, and fosters attitudes, motivations, and commitments; and Improve refuse collection system and promote private sector participation; among others...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Background: Children {{under five}} years, {{particularly}} aged 2 - 4 years (24 - 48 months), {{are more vulnerable}} to intestinal parasitic infections. This is because, children with this ages may contract infective agents during their intense activities, and adventures such as crawling or walking on bare ground, sand or grasses or eating mud/pica. Increased population density, lack of awareness, poor sanitation, and poor public health practices, and <b>environmental</b> <b>sanitations,</b> affect the prevalence of parasitic infection in tropical countries. Moreover, the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections among the asymptomatic children aged under five is not well studied. Objectives: The objectives {{of this study was}} to investigate the prevalence of intestinal parasitic infections among the asymptomatic children aged 6 - 59 months in selected Southern Ethiopia including Gedeo, Amaro, Walyta and Kambata. Methods: A cross-sectional study was carried out and the sampling design combined multistage sampling methods including, both simple random sampling technique, population density and systematic random sampling techniques. The course of this study took over a period of 5 months, from September 2009 to January 2010. Study participants were estimated by convenient sampling method to include 406 asymptomatic children (217 females and 189 males) from the systematically selected households of the study sites. Parasitological diagnosis of the parasites was done using the standard parasite and ova method. A total of 406 stool specimens were examined by a direct microscopy using a normal saline (0. 9 %) and lugol‚Äôs iodine wet mount techniques to determine the infection of intestinal parasites and the analysi...|$|R
