40|$|Community {{policing}} {{initiatives that}} aim to address diversity are increasingly required {{to engage with}} <b>Gypsies</b> and Travellers. In this article the policing of <b>Gypsies</b> and Travellers is outlined through analysis of empirical research in the south-west of England. The {{research shows that the}} police work with multiple public and private agencies to control the movement and settlement of <b>Gypsies</b> and Travellers, but the engagement of <b>Gypsies</b> and Travellers in community policing initiatives is limited. The police primarily engage with <b>Gypsies</b> and Travellers through enforcement practice. <b>Gypsies</b> and Travellers are shown here to respond to their experiences of policing {{in a number of ways}} that attempt to place them beyond the gaze of formal agencies. In conclusion the article questions the degree to which policing agencies can reach <b>Gypsies</b> and Travellers via community policing approaches. Key Words diversity • governance • <b>Gypsies</b> and Travellers • policing This article will draw on research carried out with <b>Gypsies</b> and Travellers to discuss the reach of community policing in a diverse society. Initially the art-icle will contextualize the position of <b>Gypsies</b> and Travellers in England and Wales in late modern society before going on to address their governance. The article will identify how community policing initiatives have developed in work with <b>Gypsies</b> and Travellers. It will then go on to show that the majority of <b>Gypsies</b> and Travellers experience policing through enforcement, 367 - 390 CRJ- 082062. qxd 4 / 10 / 07 1 : 56 PM Page 36...|$|R

A discourse analysis was conducted on three discussion forums concerning <b>Gypsies</b> and how they should be treated. The analysis identified the following strategies as being commonly used to express hatred towards, and to argue against right for, Gypsies: (1) referring to <b>Gypsies</b> as the ‘other’ who are abnormal; (2) constructing criminality as a key characteristic of Gypsies; (3) suggesting that some <b>Gypsies</b> are ‘bogus’, which was used to argue against all Gypsies; and (4) presenting <b>Gypsies</b> as outside of the law and given favouritism over settled British communities. The findings are discussed in light of existing literature surrounding the prejudice towards <b>Gypsies</b> and other minorities and suggestions for overcoming this prejudice are presented...|$|R

Settling into a Belgravia flat, she was soon in demand among London society, having dinners held in her honour.
