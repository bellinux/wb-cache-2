40|$|We examine {{behavioural}} changes of basketball players {{arising from the}} hot-hand belief and use data of 1216 National Basketball Association games to measure the effect of cold and <b>hot</b> <b>streaks</b> on three proxies of shot difficulty. We find that the more consecutive shots players make (miss), the more difficult (easier) shots become along the three dimensions. Furthermore, most players' performance seems to improve during <b>hot</b> <b>streaks</b> because they attempt more difficult shots while no significant decrease in shooting accuracy takes place. This might explain why most previous studies could not find empirical evidence for the hot-hand belief in basketball when considering in-game field goal shooting...|$|R

On July 4, 1914, the Braves lost both games of a doubleheader to the Brooklyn Dodgers. The consecutive losses put their record at 26–40 and the Braves were in last place, 15 games behind the league-leading New York Giants, who had won the previous three league pennants. After a day off, the Braves started to {{put together}} a <b>hot</b> <b>streak,</b> and from July 6 through September 5, the Braves went 41–12. On September 7 and 8, the Braves took two of three games from the New York Giants and moved into first place.

They were the only team, under the old eight-team league format, to win a pennant after being in last place on the Fourth of July. They were in last place as late as July 18, but were close to the pack, moving into fourth on July 21 and second place on August 12.|$|E

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 Since High Temperature Gas-cooled Reactors {{are being}} {{considered}} as most promising design of upcoming IV Gen reactors, thus key research areas were identified to address safety {{aspects of this}} design. Number of simulations and experiments need to be conducted in this field. In this study thermal-hydraulics aspects of coolant flow through Lower Plenum (LP) of HTGR were considered. In specific: flow characteristics, risk of temperature stratification in LP and <b>hot</b> <b>streaking.</b> As power profile is non-uniform across the core, jets of coolant exit the core region at different temperatures and enter the LP impinging on LP floor creating possibility of hot spots at LP structure and temperature stratification in the plenum itself. Large local temperature gradients can cause material degradation effects. To address those issues numerical simulation and an experiment were developed. The numerical simulation provides coolant flow velocity and temperature fields. The {{purpose of this study}} is developing a method for gas mixing promotion in the Lower Plenum of HTTF to reduce risk of the <b>hot</b> <b>streaking</b> and thermal stratification phenomena during normal operation. Following aspect are being examined: identification of gas flow behavior in lower plenum of HTTF based on CFD simulations, identification of <b>hot</b> <b>streaking</b> issue in the HTTF lower plenum using CFD tools, scooping study for available methods for mixing promotion and computational investigation of efficiency of selected method. Study includes description of experimental setup of HTTF, guidance for LP CFD modeling, results and analysis of CFD simulations and proposition of thermal mixing enhancement using available methods...|$|R

The following night on Raw, while the status of Team Hell No was left {{up in the air}} after both members considered individual pursuits, Bryan and Orton faced off in a no disqualification match that Orton won via referee stoppage after Bryan suffered a legit nerve injury, which was a stinger resulting in Bryan being unable to feel both his arms {{for the rest of the}} match. Four days later on SmackDown, Bryan defeated Orton, but to Bryan's dismay, it was via countout. On the next Raw, Bryan decisively defeated Orton via submission in a street fight, and later continued his <b>hot</b> <b>streak</b> by picking up wins over Sheamus and Christian.

Following the midweek win over the Crew, United traveled to Toronto, where they faced a Toronto F.C. squad that had struggled since their star Giovinco was injured. Jozy Altidore, however, continued his <b>hot</b> <b>streak.</b> as he dribbled past both Birnbaum and Hamid and scored to stake the home team to a lead in the 36th minute.

Pending the next day's Montreal Impact match, the win catapulted D.C. at least temporarily into 4th place in the Eastern Conference. The Toronto match was followed by a break for international games, and both Birnbaum and Hamid were called into the national team. Birnbaum made the trip to Cuba where he was a second-half substitute, but a kick to the face left him bloody and needing stitches.|$|E

Bob Murray replaced him as general manager, but the team struggled {{to make the playoffs}} as the eighth seed in the Western Conference. A bevy of trade deadline deals saw the departure of some mainstays from the Cup team, including Chris Kunitz, who was traded to the Pittsburgh Penguins for defenseman Ryan Whitney; Samuel Pahlsson, who was traded to the Columbus Blue Jackets for defenseman James Wisniewski; and Travis Moen, who was traded to the San Jose Sharks for two prospects. The trades gave the Ducks new life as a <b>hot</b> <b>streak</b> to end the season launched the team into the playoffs. Jonas Hiller emerged as the new number one goalie during the stretch drive. The Ducks defeated the number one seed and Presidents' Trophy-winning San Jose Sharks in six games in the first round before being eliminated in the conference semi-finals by the eventual Western Conference champion Detroit Red Wings in seven games. Before the 2009–10 season, the Ducks traded Chris Pronger to the Philadelphia Flyers for Joffrey Lupul, Luca Sbisa and two first round draft picks. Francois Beauchemin and Rob Niedermayer also left via free agency for the Toronto Maple Leafs and New Jersey Devils, respectively. The Ducks then signed free agent center and former Montreal Canadiens captain Saku Koivu to a one-year deal.|$|E
