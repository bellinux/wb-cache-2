The phrase-“a rare book”-can mean any one of three different things depending on the sense in which it is used. Two of these meanings-those used in a narrow, conditional sense to indicate merely that a particular volume is either not plentiful, or that it possesses some quality distinguishing it as being unusually excellent or meritorious-can be banished at once from consideration. Neither of these restricted meanings can be properly conveyed by our phrase, unless one or the other is expressly stipulated for or inferentially suggested by context. They are both well outside our province. The concern here is exclusively with the third and quite different meaning of this phrase; its meaning, unconditioned by any qualifica...|$|R
