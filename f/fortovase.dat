Roche announced in May 2005 that, owing to reduction in demand, <b>Fortovase</b> would cease being marketed early in 2006 {{in favour of}} Invirase boosted with ritonavir.|$|E

50|$|The most {{frequent}} adverse events with saquinavir in either formulation are mild gastrointestinal symptoms, including diarrhea, nausea, loose stools & abdominal discomfort. Invirase is better tolerated than <b>Fortovase.</b>|$|E
50|$|Saquinavir, in the Invirase formulation, {{has a low}} and {{variable}} oral bioavailability, when given alone. The <b>Fortovase</b> formulation at the standard dosage delivers approximately eightfold more active drug than Invirase, also at the standard dosage.|$|E
50|$|Saquinavir, {{sold under}} the brand names Invirase and <b>Fortovase,</b> is an {{antiretroviral}} drug used {{together with other}} medications to treat or prevent HIV/AIDS. Typically it is used with ritonavir or lopinavir/ritonavir to increase its effect. It is taken by mouth.|$|E
40|$|Roche Pharmaceuticals {{would like}} {{to inform you that}} the sale and {{distribution}} of <b>Fortovase</b> — the 200 -mg soft-gel formulation of saquinavir — will be discontinued by February 15, 2006. Roche has taken this action because the clinical demand for <b>Fortovase</b> has declined significantly; this is not the result of any safety or efficacy issues regarding the product. Invirase, which is the preferred formulation of saquinavir, will continue to be available in 200 -mg and 500 -mg formulations. Invirase offers patients key advantages over <b>Fortovase,</b> including: • Lower pill burden – approved dosing for 500 -mg Invirase is 1000 mg twice-daily with 100 mg of ritonavir BID (3 pills twice daily or a total count of 6 pills) • Improved GI tolerability (less diarrhea and vomiting) 1 – Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Guidelines state: “The hard gel capsule appears to have much better gastrointestinal tolerance than the soft gel preparation. ” 2 • Smaller capsules/tablets – both 200 -mg and 500 -mg Invirase formulation are smaller in size than <b>Fortovase</b> capsules. • No need for refrigeration. At this time, we encourage physicians to refrain from starting <b>Fortovase</b> treatment in their HIV-positiv...|$|E
40|$|Herbal therapies {{are widely}} used, {{but there are}} few data on their {{interactions}} with conventional medications. This study evaluated the effect of garlic supplements on the pharmacokinetics of saquinavir. Ten healthy volunteers received 10 doses of saquinavir (<b>Fortovase)</b> at a dosage of 1200 mg 3 times daily with meals for 4 days on study days 1 – 4, 22 – 25, and 36 – 39, and they received a total of 41 doses of garlic caplets taken 2 times daily on study days 5 – 25. Blood samples were obtained on study days 4, 25, and 39 for determination of saquinavir plasma pharmacokinetic parameters. In the presence of garlic, the mean saquinavir area under the curve (AUC) during the 8 -h dosing interval decreased by 51 %, trough levels at 8 h after dosing decreased by 49 %, and the mean maximum concentrations (Cmax) decreased by 54 %. After the 10 -day washout period, the AUC, trough, and Cmax values returned to 60 %– 70 % of their values at baseline. Patients should use caution when combining garlic supplements with saquinavir when it {{is used as a}} sole protease inhibitor. We have been interested in the effects that comple-mentary medicines can have on the pharmacokinetics of antiretroviral medicines, especially drugs metabo-lized by the cytochrome P 450 (CYP 450) system, because HIV-infected persons frequently use herbal remedie...|$|E
40|$|Technology Catalysts International {{reported}} in 2002 that approximately 35 - 40 % {{of all new}} chemical compounds suffer from poor aqueous solubility and present a major challenge to modern drug delivery system, because of their low oral bioavailability. Several strategies to improve the solubility and dissolution of poorly water soluble drugs have been developed, which were at start primarily based on modifying the drug’s physicochemical properties. Realization that the oral bioavailability of poor water soluble drugs may be enhanced when co-administered with meal rich in fat has led to increasing recent interest {{in the formulation of}} poorly water soluble drugs in lipids. Lipid-based drug delivery systems have gained considerable interest after the commercial success of Sandimmune NeoralTM (Cyclosporine A), Novartis Pvt. Ltd. and <b>Fortovase</b> (Saquinavir), Roche Laboratories Inc. Self micro-emulsifying drug delivery systems are a class of lipid based drug delivery systems. Self micro emulsifying drug delivery systems are isotropic mixtures of oil, surfactant, and co-surfactant and are a vital tool in solving low bioavailability issues of poorly soluble drugs. Lipophilic drugs can be dissolved in these systems, enabling them to be administered as a unit dosage form for per-oral administration. When such a system is released in the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, it disperses to form a fine w/o microemulsion with the aid of GI fluid. This leads to in situ solubilization of drug that can subsequently be absorbed by lymphatic pathways, bypassing the hepatic first-pass effect. This article represents a complete review on self micro-emulsifying drug delivery system...|$|E
