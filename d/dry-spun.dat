40|$|As an {{electrical}} double layer capacitor, <b>dry-spun</b> carbon nanotube yarn possesses relatively low specific capacitance. This can be significantly increased {{as a result}} of the pseudocapacitance of functional groups on the carbon nanotubes developed by oxidation using a gamma irradiation treatment in the presence of air. When coated with high-performance polyaniline nanowires, the gamma-irradiated carbon nanotube yarn acts as a high-strength reinforcement and a high-efficiency current collector in two-ply yarn supercapacitors for transporting charges generated along the long electrodes. The resulting supercapacitors demonstrate excellent electrochemical performance, cycle stability, and resistance to folding-unfolding that are required in wearable electronic textiles...|$|E
40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of acrylic fibers shape on the flexural behavior of cement composite. The fibers differ in their cross-sectional shapes due to the spinning process (wet-spun and <b>dry-spun).</b> The fibers were characterized by optical microscopy, and the shape factors were calculated {{on the basis of}} their geometric characteristics. Results showed that both types of acrylic fiber remarkably improved the flexural performance of the composites. Wet-spun acrylic fibers lead to high flexural strength and toughness. It was found that by increasing the fibers’ shape factor by a factor of 10 %, flexural strength and toughness increase to 26 % and 23 %, respectively...|$|E

To understand {{the mechanism of}} water removal during silk fiber spinning process, a microfluidic chip was designed and applied to investigate the structures and mechanical properties of two kinds of regenerated silk fibroin fibers <b>dry-spun</b> at different relative humidity. The experimental {{results showed that the}} diameters of the fibers spun at 40 % RH are always larger than the fibers spun at 50 % RH due to different removal rates of water. The fibers spun at low humidity contain more β-sheet structure and lower degree of chain orientation and crystalline orientation.

40|$|Poly (ε-caprolactone) fibers were {{prepared}} by dry-spinning method. The effect of processing parameters on linear density, mechanical, and morphological properties of fibers was investigated using the response surface methodology (RSM). This method allowed evaluating a quantitative relationship between polymer concentrations, spinning speed, and draw ratio on {{the properties of}} the fibers. Polynomial regression model was fitted to the experimental data to generate predicted response. The results were subjected to analysis of variance to determine significant parameters. It was found that all three parameters had significant effect on linear density of fibers. Combined effect of concentration and spinning speed was observed in which the linear density of fiber was more sensitive to changes in the solution concentration at lower spinning speed. Polymer concentration had the largest influence on the mechanical properties of fibers. An average cross-sectional radius of fibers was affected by concentration and draw ratio in opposite manner. Among all three parameters, only polymer concentration had significant effect on circularity of fiber cross sections. By applying the RSM, it was possible to obtain a mathematical model {{that can be used to}} better define processing parameters to fabricate <b>dry-spun</b> PCL fiber in a more rational manner...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Polymerization {{effluents}} (PME) from <b>dry-spun</b> {{acrylic fiber}} manufacturing {{are hard to}} degrade. This paper evaluated the distribution characteristics of PME pollutants by means of multi scale membrane filtrations, including microfiltration (5 µm and 1 µm), ultrafiltration (50 KD, 10 KD and 6 KD), nanofiltration and reverse osmosis. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and laser particle size analyzer (LPSA) tests were also used as assistant measurements. The majority of particles in PME are mainly categorized as supracolloidal structures. 70 % of them rage from 5 µm to 20 µm with a median size of 9. 99 µm. Particulate, colloidal and soluble portions contribute 7. 6 %, 8. 2 % and 75. 2 % to the initial COD, meaning that the soluble fraction, which is also poor in biodegradability, {{plays a key role}} in PME treatment. 26. 8 % of TN, mainly consisting of various acrylonitrile copolymers, exists in the colloidal portion; while 70. 5 % of it, mainly comprised of ammonia, cyanide and nitrile, distributes in the soluble portion. The distribution characteristics of ammonia and SO 3 2 - are similar. Respectively 92. 7 % and 94. 7 % distributes in the soluble portion...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Spinning {{effluents}} (SE) from <b>dry-spun</b> {{acrylic fiber}} manufacturing {{are hard to}} degrade due to the containing of vast dimethyl formamide (DMF). Activated carbon, ion exchange and Fenton oxidation were applied to solve this problem. Coconut-shell-based activated carbon exhibited a better performance than the coal-based and nut-shell-based ones did. At the optimal dosage of 1 g/L, pH= 6 and 30 ℃, the removal of COD and DMF were respectively 84. 39 % and 66. 14 %. Ion exchange resins are rated as NKA- 9 > D 301 R> D 201 > 201 × 7 respected to the performance, and the optimum COD and DMF removal were 82. 31 % and 68. 76 % at the NKA- 9 dosage of 0. 22 g, pH= 7 and 30 ℃. The most appropriate treatment process appeared to be Fenton. COD and DMF were finally reduced to 23. 29 mg/L and 23. 43 mg/L, with removal rates of 90. 23 % and 79. 43 % respectively. This optimum efficiency was obtained at c(H 2 O 2) /c(Fe 2 +) of 14 : 1, pH= 3, 50 ℃, and an oxidation time of 3 h...|$|E
40|$|Production of high {{strength}} carbon fibers from bio-derived precursors is of topical interest. Recently, we reported on dry-spinning of a partially acetylated softwood kraft lignin to produce carbon fibers with superior properties, but the thermo-oxidative stabilization step required {{a long time}} due to a slow heating rate needed to prevent the fibers from being heated too rapidly and sticking to each other. Here we report a rapid strategy of dual UV-thermoxidative stabilization (crosslinking) of <b>dry-spun</b> lignin fibers that significantly reduces the stabilization time. The fibers undergo reaction {{close to the surface}} such that they can be subsequently thermally stabilized at a rapid heating rate without fibers fusing together, which reduces the total stabilization time significantly from 40 to 4 h. Consequently, the glass transition temperature of UV irradiated fibers was about 15 °C higher than that of fibers without UV treatment. Stabilized fibers were successfully carbonized at 1000 °C and resulting carbon fibers displayed a tensile strength of 900 ± 100 MPa, which is amongst the highest reported for carbon fibers derived from softwood lignin-based precursors. These results establish that UV irradiation is a rapid step that can effectively shorten the total stabilization time for production of lignin-derived carbon fibers...|$|E
40|$|THE WORSTED CLOTH TRADE The factors {{affecting}} European trade and competition in worsted cloth in foreign markets, notably the United States, {{in the second}} half of the nineteenth century are well recorded. From the 1840 s the two main worsted cloth producing countries of Europe, Britain and France, pursued quite different strategies in production and trade. Developments in dyeing technology from the late 1830 s allowed substantial improvements in the production of mixed worsted cloth; cloth of cotton warp and worsted weft. The British industry rapidly converted its production to the cheaper mixed worsteds for a much wider market to the extent that by the late 1850 s perhaps only five per cent of its output remained all-wool cloth. The French industry continued to concentrate on the production of softer all-wool worsteds, woven from <b>dry-spun</b> yarn produced on the mule; yarn which dyed better to brilliant and delicate shades. As a result Britain gained much of the world market expansion from the 1840 s to the 1860 s but France retained clear command of the high quality market. 1 From the 1860 s, however, fashion changes perhaps partly initiated by the American Civil War, the resultant cotton famine and consequent alterations in relative raw fibre prices favoured the French, and growing German, worsted industry. Moreover tariff barriers, particularly in the United States, were most effective against lower and medium quality goods to the disadvantage of Britain. As a result the British worsted industry lost much of its home market to France and suffered a decline in trade to its major traditional markets, including the United States. It was much criticized for its lack of adaptation to French competition and there has subsequently been debate about whether it was lethargic in changing its technology and product to new market conditions. The nature and scale of the problem did not permit easy and rapid solutions. The raw materials, technology and labour skills required for all-wool worsted production were quite different and a rapid conversion to French methods of wool preparation and spinning was not quickly feasible. The British industry instead pursued a policy, initially rather slowly, of adapting its existing machinery and innovating new products, notably worsted coatings. In the two decades before the First World War it did recoup some of its previous trade losses but its level of trade did not recover to that of earlier years. ...|$|E
