5|$|A Quistclose {{trust is}} a trust created where a {{creditor}} has lent {{money to a}} <b>debtor</b> for a particular purpose. In {{the event that the}} <b>debtor</b> uses the money for any other purpose, it is held on trust for the creditor. Any inappropriately spent money can then be traced, and returned to the creditors. The name and trust comes from the House of Lords decision in Barclays Bank Ltd v Quistclose Investments Ltd (1970), although the underlying principles can be traced back further. There has been much academic debate over the classification of Quistclose trusts in existing trusts law: whether they are resulting trusts, express trusts, constructive trusts or, as Lord Millett said in Twinsectra Ltd v Yardley, illusory trusts.|$|E

5|$|A country's {{external}} {{wealth is}} measured by the value of its foreign assets net of its foreign liabilities. A current account surplus (and corresponding financial account deficit) indicates an increase in external wealth while a deficit indicates a decrease. Aside from current account indications of whether a country is a net buyer or net seller of assets, shifts in a nation's external wealth are influenced by capital gains and capital losses on foreign investments. Having positive external wealth means a country is a net lender (or creditor) in the world economy, while negative external wealth indicates a net borrower (or <b>debtor).</b>|$|E

The research aims to explore on how <b>debtors</b> impairment can be done. The determination of revenue recognition is also investigated upon in this research. This research project highlights briefly on {{the background of the}} study, as well as the approach taken by the researcher to address the research problem. The available literature on revenue recognition and <b>debtors</b> impairment was used in conducting the objectives of this research. Ways and means on how <b>debtors</b> can be impaired and when to impair <b>debtors</b> was stated by different authors. Research objectives on relationship between <b>debtors</b> impairment and revenue and how the credit risk of TelOne (Pvt) Limited clients can affect the impairment of <b>debtors</b> are also discussed. The research was done by using purposive sampling whilst gathering information by using questionnaires and interviews. Findings and responses from questionnaires and interviews conducted by the researcher on TelOne management and employees are presented and summarised in under the umbrella term Presentation and Analysis. These responses are linked to what is said on literature review. Conclusions on the research project and some recommendations on when to do <b>debtors</b> impairment and how revenue can be recognised correctly are stipulated in this research. This is to avoid overstating or understating of the values of <b>debtors</b> and revenue in the financial statements of TelOne. The contribution of this study to the existing literature is to show <b>debtors</b> impairment {{play a crucial role in}} the correct valuation of <b>debtors.</b> The underlying reason is that TelOne provide services and products to their clients being their <b>debtors</b> thus they should be valued correctly...|$|R

5|$|A {{relatively}} advanced {{theory of}} interest is also presented. Cantillon believed that interest originates from the need of borrowers for capital and from the fear of loss of the lenders, meaning that borrowers have to recompense lenders for {{the risk of the}} possible insolvency of the <b>debtor.</b> In turn, interest is paid out of earned profits originating from the return on invested capital. While previously it was believed that the rate of interest varied inversely to the quantity of money, Cantillon posited that the rate of interest was determined by the supply and demand on the loanable funds market—an insight usually attributed to Scottish philosopher David Hume. As such, while saved money impacts the rate of interest, new money that is instead used for consumption does not; Cantillon's theory {{of interest is}} therefore similar to John Maynard Keynes's liquidity preference theory.|$|E
5|$|Berry dated Chicago dentist John Ronan from March 1989 to October 1991. In November 1993, Ronan sued Berry for $80,000 in what {{he claimed}} were unpaid loans to help launch her career. Berry contended that the money was a gift, and a judge {{dismissed}} the case because Ronan did not list Berry as a <b>debtor</b> when he filed for bankruptcy in 1992. According to Berry, a beating from a former abusive boyfriend during the filming of The Last Boy Scout punctured her eardrum and caused her to lose eighty percent of her hearing in her left ear.

5|$|The fourth part, The Shadow Side, {{looks at}} {{what happens to}} debtors and {{creditors}} when debts are not re-paid. Some debts that are a matter of honour to which the <b>debtor</b> must repay by an equivalent value or creditor must either forgive or exact revenge. Debts to society, after committing crimes, are paid through vengeance-based imprisonment. The United Kingdom had debtors' prison for {{those who could not}} pay, but this was abolished for economic reasons as it prevented labourers from working and had a burdensome cost of operation. Other societies used the services of their family members or themselves as collateral. Sometimes the debtors overthrew the creditors, like King Philip IV of France against the Knights Templar, or the Ugandans against the Asians. Atwood applies the trickle-down economics to debt and examines the psychology side through the Jungian Shadow.|$|E
40|$|The {{discharge}} injunction, {{which allows}} former <b>debtors</b> {{to be free}} from any efforts to collect former debt, is a primary feature of bankruptcy law in the United States. When creditors have systemically violated debtors’ discharge injunctions, some <b>debtors</b> have attempted to challenge those creditors through a class action lawsuit in bankruptcy court. However, the pervasiveness of class-waiving arbitration clauses likely prevents those <b>debtors</b> from disputing discharge injunction violations outside of binding, individual arbitration. This Note first discusses areas of disagreement regarding how former <b>debtors</b> may enforce their discharge injunctions. Then, it examines the types of disputes that allow <b>debtors</b> to collectivize in bankruptcy court. Without seeking to resolve either disagreement, this Note assumes <b>debtors</b> may collectivize in this context and employs an “inherent conflict” test that looks to whether disputes over discharge injunction violations are arbitrable. Because the “inherent conflict” test likely leads to the conclusion that courts must enforce class-waiving arbitration clauses, this Note argues that Congress should amend the Bankruptcy Code not only to provide <b>debtors</b> an express right of action under § 524 and the ability to collectivize, but also to prohibit the arbitration of these claims. Doing so will give full effect to the discharge injunction and fulfill the promise to <b>debtors</b> that they can truly begin anew after bankruptcy...|$|R

In a jail owned by the Bishop of Ely, Howard wrote, prisoners had ten years earlier been kept chained to the floor on their backs, with spiked collars round their necks and iron bars over their legs. The Duke of Portland had a one-room cellar in Chesterfield that housed four prisoners, with no straw or heat, which had not been cleaned for months. Lord Arundel owned a jail in Penzance, where Howard found a <b>debtor</b> in a room 11ftx11ft and 6ft high, with a small window. The door of the room had not been opened for four weeks.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, Rowan was {{appointed}} to the Kentucky Court of Appeals, serving until his resignation 1821. He was again elected to the state legislature in 1823. With the state reeling from the Panic of 1819, Rowan became the leader of a group of legislators dedicated to enacting laws favorable to the state's large <b>debtor</b> class. He believed {{the will of the people}} was sovereign and roundly denounced the Court of Appeals for striking down debt relief legislation as unconstitutional. He led the effort to impeach the offending justices, and when that effort failed, spearheaded a movement to abolish the court entirely and replace it with a new one, touching off the Old Court – New Court controversy. New Court partisans in the legislature elected Rowan to the U.S. Senate in 1824. During his term, the nascent Whig Party ascended to power in the state legislature, and at the expiration of his term in 1831, the Whigs replaced him with party founder Henry Clay.|$|E
5|$|Left undone, however, was {{extending}} the laws dealing with surveying and registering land claims with the registrar {{of the state}} land office. Cognizant that the old law would expire November 30, 1797, Garrard issued a proclamation on November 3 calling the legislature into special session. The legislators convened on November 28, and Garrard, drawing on {{his experience as a}} surveyor, addressed them regarding the urgency of adopting a new law and forestalling more lawsuits related to land claims, which were already numerous. Although a wealthy landowner himself, Garrard advocated protecting Kentucky's large <b>debtor</b> class from foreclosure on their lands. Garrard supported pro-squatting legislation, including measures that forbade the collection of taxes from squatters on profits they made from working the land they occupied and that required landowners to pay squatters for any improvements they made on their land. Despite opposition from some aristocratic legislators like John Breckinridge, most of the reforms advocated by Garrard were approved in the session.|$|E
5000|$|Generally, a {{creditor}} who {{has obtained}} a monetary judgment (a ruling from a court under which another party {{is required to}} pay money to the creditor) may enforce this judgment through the seizure and forced sale of the <b>debtor's</b> property, through the seizure of money held in the <b>debtor's</b> bank accounts, and through garnishment of the <b>debtor's</b> wages. In each instance, however, the creditor is required {{to engage in a}} [...] "public act", such as the recording of a lien on the title to the <b>debtor's</b> real estate to be seized, or using other public notice to place a lien on <b>debtor's</b> personal property. Thus, the required public act fixes a lien on the <b>debtor's</b> property. Not only does this establish the rights of the creditor to seize and sell the property, it also determines what priority the creditor will have against other creditors who may wish to seize the same property.|$|R

5|$|A Democratic-Republican, Garrard {{opposed the}} Alien and Sedition Acts and favored {{passage of the}} Kentucky Resolutions. He lobbied for public education, militia and prison reforms, {{business}} subsidies, and legislation favorable to the state's large <b>debtor</b> class. In 1798, the state's first governor's mansion was constructed, and Garrard became its first resident. Due {{in part to the}} confusion resulting from the 1795 election, he favored calling a constitutional convention in 1799. Because of his anti-slavery views, he was not chosen as a delegate to the convention. Under the resulting constitution, the governor was popularly elected and was forbidden from succeeding himself in office, although Garrard was personally exempted from this provision and was re-elected in 1799. During his second term, he applauded Thomas Jefferson's purchase of Louisiana from France as a means of dealing with the closure of the port at New Orleans to U.S. goods. Late in his term, his Secretary of State, Harry Toulmin, persuaded him to adopt some doctrines of Unitarianism, and he was expelled from the Baptist church, ending his ministry. He also clashed with the legislature over the appointment of a registrar for the state land office, leaving him embittered and unwilling to continue in politics after the conclusion of his term. He retired to his estate, Mount Lebanon, and engaged in agricultural and commercial pursuits until his death on January 19, 1822. Garrard County, Kentucky, created during his first term, was named in his honor.|$|E
5|$|In 1807, Desha {{was elected}} to the first of six {{consecutive}} terms in the U.S. House of Representatives. A Democratic-Republican, he was considered a war hawk, supporting the War of 1812. In 1813, he volunteered to serve in the war and commanded a division at the Battle of the Thames. Returning to Congress after the war, he was {{the only member of the}} Kentucky congressional delegation to oppose the unpopular Compensation Act of 1816. Nearly every other member of the delegation was defeated for reelection after the vote, but Desha's opposition to the act helped him retain his seat. He did not seek reelection in 1818, and made an unsuccessful run for governor in 1820, losing to John Adair. By 1824, the Panic of 1819 had ruined Kentucky's economy, and Desha made a second campaign for the governorship almost exclusively on promises of relief for the state's large <b>debtor</b> class. He was elected by a large majority, and debt relief partisans captured both houses of the General Assembly. After the Kentucky Court of Appeals overturned debt relief laws favored by Desha and the majority of the legislature, the legislators abolished the court and created a replacement court, to which Desha appointed several debt relief partisans. The existing court refused to acknowledge the legitimacy of the move, and during a period known as the Old Court – New Court controversy, two courts of last resort existed in the state.|$|E
