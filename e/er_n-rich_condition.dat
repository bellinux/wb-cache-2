40|$|The {{growth of}} GaN {{nanowires}} from Ga and NH 3 {{sources in the}} flow of Ar carrier gas using a chemical vapor deposition (CVD) system was systematically studied. The substrates used were Si(111) and Si(100).

We investigated the influence of growth temperature, catalyst used, Ga amount, and the ratio of Ar and NH 3 flow rates on the morphology and properties of GaN nanowires. We found that the best results were obtained for a growth temperature of 950  °C. Optimal catalysts were Au and metallic Ni, while the use of nickel nitrate was found to lead to formation of SiO x nanowire bunches in addition to GaN nanowires.

The results are compared with experimentally observed surface morphologies of (000 - 1) GaN layers grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. The proposed kMC two-component model of GaN(000 - 1) surface where both types of atoms: nitrogen and gallium attach the surface and diffuse independently, explains that at relatively high rates of the step flow (miscut angle < 2 deg) the low diffusion of gallium adatoms causes surface instabilities and leads to experimentally observed roughening while for low rates of the step flow (miscut 4 deg), smooth surface can be obtained. In the presence of almost immobile nitrogen atoms under <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions,</b> the growth is realized {{by the process of}} two-dimensional island nucleation and coalescence. Additionally, we show that higher crystal miscut, lower crystal growth rate or higher temperature results in similar effect of the smoothening of the surface. We show that the surface also smoothens for the growth conditions with very high N-excess. The presence of large number of nitrogen atoms changes locally mobility of gallium atoms thus providing easier coalescence of separated island. Comment: 23 pages, 9 figure...|$|R

At 680 C, the Ga/N ratio is found to have a dominant impact on the zinc-blende GaMnN epilayer growth rate and the resultant composition, morphology and microstructure. A maximum growth rate and an optimised microstructure are associated with growth under slightly Ga-rich conditions. A reduced growth rate and enhanced Mn incorporation are associated with growth under slightly <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions.</b> Increasing Mn flux under <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions</b> is considered to lead to a build up of a Mn surfactant layer during the early stages of growth and to a transition from zinc-blende single phase growth to zinc-blende/wurtzite mixed phase growth. Further, under Ga-rich conditions at low temperature, GaMnN films adopt a tilted growth mode, with close packed planes for both hexagonal and cubic phases being tilted roughly parallel to the growth surface, and this way of modified growth is also accompanied by improved Mn incorporation which is not commonly found for samples grown under Ga-rich conditions at elevated temperature.

Thus, strict transcriptional and post-translational control of the N-assimilation is fundamental for survival of this species. GlnR is a global response regulator that controls transcription of the genes related to the N-assimilation in S. coelicolor {{and other members of}} the Actinomycetales. GlnR represents an atypical orphan response regulator that is not activated by the phosphorylation of the conserved aspartate residue (Asp 50). We have applied transcriptional analysis, LC-MS/MS analysis and electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) to understand the regulation of GlnR in S. coelicolor M 145. The expression of glnR and GlnR-target genes was revisited under four different N-defined conditions and a complex <b>N-rich</b> <b>condition.</b> Although, the expression of selected GlnR-target genes was strongly responsive to changing N-concentrations, the glnR expression itself was independent of the N-availability. Using LC-MS/MSanalysis we demonstrated that GlnR was post-translationally modified. The post-translational modifications of GlnR comprise phosphorylation of the serine/threonine residues and acetylation of lysine residues. In the complex N-rich medium GlnR was phosphorylated on six serine/ threonine residues and acetylated on one lysine residue. Under defined N-excess conditions only two phosphorylated residues were detected whereas under defined N-limiting conditions no phosphorylation was observed. GlnR phosphorylation is thus clearly correlated with <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions.</b> Furthermore, GlnR was acetylated on four lysine residues independently of the N-concentration in the defined media and on only one lysine residue in the complex N-rich medium. Using EMSAs we demonstrated that phosphorylation inhibited the binding of GlnR to its targets genes, whereas acetylation had little influence on the formation of GlnR-DNA complex. This study clearly demonstrated that GlnR DNA-binding affinity is modulated by post-translational modifications in response to changing N-conditions in order to elicit a proper transcriptional response to the latter...|$|R

By doping with Mg, the NW shape does not significantly change although the wires tend to coalesce. The photoelectric transport in GaN NWs is extremely sensitive to the NW diameter. This effect is used to determine the doping level. The free carrier concentration and mobility were also estimated using Raman measurements. For Si-doped InN NWs, a reduced NW density is observed, in comparison to the undoped counterpart. At high Si doping, the InN NW morphology is improved leading to more uniform diameter NWs. InN NWs have metallic conductance because of a high background bulk concentration and the surface electron accumulation layer. The broadening of the photoluminescence (PL) spectra as a function of Fermi level was used to determine the electron concentration in different InN NW-samples. A comparison of Raman scattering and electrical measurements is also presented...|$|R
40|$|We {{study the}} {{adsorption}} of Ga on (0001) GaN surfaces by reflection high-energy electron diffraction. It is {{shown that a}} dynamically stable Ga bilayer can be formed on the GaN surface for appropriate Ga fluxes and substrate temperatures. The influence {{of the presence of}} this Ga film on the growth mode of GaN on AlN(0001) by plasma-assisted molecular-beam epitaxy is studied. It is demonstrated that under nearly stoichiometric and <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions,</b> the GaN layer relaxes elastically during the first stages of epitaxy. At high temperatures the growth follows a Stranski-Krastanov mode, whereas at lower temperatures kinetically formed flat platelets are observed. Under Ga-rich conditions-where a Ga bilayer is rapidly formed due to excess Ga accumulating on the surface-the growth follows a Frank-van der Merwe layer-by-layer mode at any growth temperature and no initial elastic relaxation occurs. Hence, it is concluded that excess Ga acts as a surfactant, effectively suppressing both Stranski-Krastanov islanding and platelet formation. It is further demonstrated that the Stranski-Krastanov transition is in competition with elastic relaxation by platelets, and it is only observed when relaxation by platelets is inefficient. As a result, a growth mode phase diagram is outlined for the growth of GaN on AlN(0001) ...|$|R
40|$|To {{understand}} the mechanisms leading to coexistence and exclusion, {{it is essential}} to establish information on the nutritional needs of species. We focused on the frequently coexisting Pseudo-nitzschia species, P. delicatissima and P. galaxiae, capable of forming blooms and producing domoic acid. We employed monoculture experiments to determine growth kinetic parameters important for understanding resource use (i. e. maximum specific growth rate, half-saturation coefficients for growth and cell quotas), and we coupled mixed-culture experiments and numerical modelling to explore the role of resource competition relative to unknown factors, such as allelopathy. Experimental results showed that both species had a high requirement for nitrogen (N) and low requirement for phosphorus (P), consistent with field observations of Pseudo-nitzschia blooms in <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions.</b> The model accurately predicted the outcome of competition; P. galaxiae outcompeted P. delicatissima when considering only resource competition, but the population trajectories were better predicted when allelopathic effects were added. Since the competitive exclusion of P. delicatissima by P. galaxiae in our laboratory experiments is not consistent with observations of coexistence in the natural environment, the model was further modified to explore realistic ranges of population loss factors, such as sinking, demonstrating how coexistence is possible when these are considered...|$|R
40|$|Step {{meandering}} during {{growth of}} gallium nitride (0001) surface is studied using kinetic Monte Carlo method. Simulated growth process, conducted in <b>N-rich</b> <b>conditions</b> are therefore controlled by Ga atoms surface diffusion. The model employs dominating four-body interactions of Ga atoms that cause step flow anisotropy during growth. Overall kinetics and shape selection features of step meandering are analyzed assuming {{their dependence on}} the external particle flux and on the temperature. It appears that at relatively high temperatures and low fluxes steps move regularly preserving their initial shapes of straight, parallel lines. For higher fluxes and at wide range of temperatures step meandering happens. It is shown that, depending on the initial surface parameters, two different scenarios of step meandering are realized. In both these regimes meandering has different character {{as a function of}} time. For relatively high fluxes meanders have wavelengths shorter than the terrace width and they grow independently. Eventually surface ends up as a rough structure. When flux is lower regular pattern of meanders emerges. Step meander even if Schwoebel barrier is absent. Too high barrier destroys step stability. The amplitude of wavelike step meanders increases in time up to a saturation value. The mechanism of such meander development is elucidated. Comment: 21 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
