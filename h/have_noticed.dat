5|$|While {{entering}} the landing pattern, crash trucks would {{travel to the}} runway and await landing. This was standard procedure for all Head Start landings. After landing, the crew was interrogated prior to being released, so that maintenance, intelligence, and other crews could be alerted {{to the performance of}} the plane and other items that the crew might <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> during their flight. After release, they would typically go to the Physical Conditioning room for a steam bath and rubdown.|$|E

"It is very simple," [...] said Fisher, [...] "when Boyle {{straightened}} {{himself from}} his stooping posture, something had happened which he <b>had</b> not <b>noticed,</b> which his enemy <b>had</b> not <b>noticed,</b> which nobody <b>had</b> <b>noticed.</b> The two coffee cups had exactly changed places." ...|$|R

5|$|Beginning {{with the}} work of J. D. Brown and Marc Henneaux in 1986, {{physicists}} <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> that quantum gravity in a three-dimensional spacetime is closely related to two-dimensional conformal field theory. In 1995, Henneaux and his coworkers explored this relationship in more detail, suggesting that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to the conformal field theory known as Liouville field theory. Another conjecture formulated by Edward Witten states that three-dimensional gravity in anti-de Sitter space is equivalent to a conformal field theory with monster group symmetry. These conjectures provide examples of the AdS/CFT correspondence that do not require the full apparatus of string or M-theory.|$|E
5|$|However, {{vigilant}} {{fans would}} <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> the names years earlier. Hitler-Barassi was photographed in 1993 {{at the opening}} night of Madame Butterfly, which was published on 4 April 1993; the book revealed the member to be Peter Minack, who later released a book of his own (Campaigning With Grant) in 2000, which was about the American Civil War. The book contains thin references to TISM. In interviews about his book, Minack revealed he was a teacher, his father fought in World War II for the Germans {{and that he is}} fanatical about the Richmond Football Club, explaining his stage moniker.|$|E
5|$|Animation enthusiasts <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> {{similarities}} between Aladdin and Richard Williams' unfinished film The Thief and the Cobbler (also known as Arabian Knight under Miramax Films and The Princess and the Cobbler under Majestic Films International). These similarities include a similar plot, similar characters, scenes and background designs, and the antagonist Zig-Zag's resemblance in character design and mannerisms to Genie and Jafar. Though Aladdin was released prior to The Thief and the Cobbler, The Thief and the Cobbler initially began production much {{earlier in the}} 1960s, and was mired in difficulties including financial problems, copyright issues, story revisions and late production times caused by separate studios trying to finish the film after Richard Williams was fired from the project for lack of finished work. The late release, coupled with Miramax purchasing and re-editing the film, has sometimes resulted in The Thief and the Cobbler being labeled a rip-off of Aladdin.|$|E

5|$|At the party, the {{employees}} vent their hatred of Nellie onto Pam to avoid admitting the truth, making Pam uncomfortable. The magician that was hired (Brett Gelman) arrives, much to Nellie's dismay. Jim, Dwight, and Pam, out of solidarity to Nellie, sabotage the magician's tricks until he reaches breaking point and Dwight kicks him out. Nellie and Robert commend {{the employees}} for throwing a good party, but Kevin Malone (Brian Baumgartner) complains that the carrot cake has actual vegetables in it, which Pam {{made as a}} prank. When Jim and Pam leave for the day, Pam asks Hank Tate (Hugh Dane) why he let the magician into the elevator {{when he was asked}} not to. Hank, busy reading a magazine, claims not to <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> him, stating that as a magician he could have slipped by.|$|E
5|$|Ben Neal of the Tennessee Librarian {{questioned}} King's {{heavy use}} of Works Progress Administration-collected interview material, {{noting that the}} interviewees were too old to thoughtfully recall and express the complete spectrum of slave childhood. He then absolved King of fault for the otherwise dearth of data. Neal praised the book's accessibility for casual readers and academics alike. In The Journal of American Historys review of the first edition, Loren Schweninger commended King's restrained use of the WPA sources with Neal’s same rationale. Schweninger also sought more comparisons between Southern regions and in interracial relationships. Jane Turner Censer agreed that the book treated the South and century too broadly where it could <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> specific differences due to migration patterns, regional changes, and time. Richard H. Steckel in The Georgia Historical Quarterly similarly desired comparison between slave and working class children of the era. Yet Roderick A. McDonald appreciated this broader perspective and emphasis on slave resilience and familial love in foil with two more negative and detailed, or narrower, studies (Them Dark Days by William Dusinberre and Life in Black and White by Brenda Stevenson) in his write-up for American Studies. Steckel added {{that he wanted to}} know more about the children's nutrition, and Marten felt several of King's smaller points were not fully substantiated.|$|E

25|$|Several {{scholars}} <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> that tablet G {{contains two}} structurally very different texts.

25|$|Enthusiasts {{have formed}} clubs for social play of backgammon. Local clubs may hold {{informal}} gatherings, with members meeting at cafés and bars {{in the evening}} to play and converse.

Some club leaders <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> a recent growth of interest in backgammon, and attribute it to the game's popularity on the Internet.|$|E

Charts for the Antarctic were not available to the pilot for planning purposes, being withheld until the flight was about to depart. The charts eventually provided, which were carried on the aircraft, were neither comprehensive enough nor large enough in scale to support detailed plotting.|$|E
25|$|The planet Uranus has {{a system}} of rings {{intermediate}} in complexity between the more extensive set around Saturn and the simpler systems around Jupiter and Neptune. The rings of Uranus were discovered on March 10, 1977, by James L. Elliot, Edward W. Dunham, and Douglas J. Mink. More than 200 years ago, William Herschel also reported observing rings, but modern astronomers are skeptical that he could actually <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> them, as they are very dark and faint.|$|E
25|$|When {{there is}} a talk about women and Buddhism, I <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> that people often regard the topic as {{something}} new and different. They believe that women in Buddhism has become an important topic because we live in modern times and so many women are practicing the Dharma now. However, {{this is not the}} case. The female sangha has been here for centuries. We are not bringing something new into a 2,500-year-old tradition. The roots are there, and we are simply re-energizing them.|$|E

25|$|For {{more than}} 12 years, {{scientists}} <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> that some individuals with autism also have idic(15). In fact, idic(15) {{is the most}} frequently identified chromosome problem in individuals with autism. (A chromosome anomaly involves extra or missing chromosomal material, not changes within the genes such as Fragile X syndrome). It is suggested that the co-occurrence of autism and idic(15) is not by chance. There may be a gene or genes in the 15q11-q13 region that is/are related {{to the development of}} autism in some individuals.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, neighbors saw Frank Jr., age 6, lugging a {{pick and}} shovel out into South Troy Street and start digging. Upon inquiry, Frank {{said there had}} been a lot of {{construction}} on the street the day Elsie disappeared, and he had heard his parents discussing the possibility that she had fallen into a hole. As she struggled to climb out, she might have been buried under falling sand and gravel. Workers still fixing the street said that it was possible, but they would <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> immediately. Meanwhile, people in the West End and a woman in Kings, Illinois reported sightings of light-skinned girls traveling with gypsies.|$|E
25|$|Enríquez {{expected}} to emerge stronger from this process, however, is relationship with Danío quickly {{took a turn}} for the worst. It is likely that the governor felt that the privateer was not willing to cooperate or help him during the investigation. The remainder of Enríquez's enemies may <b>have</b> <b>noticed</b> this and pursued his favor, leaving Pozo and his faction alone. During the course of the trial, the animosity between Danío and the privateer became evident. The residents of San Juan were surprised, being familiar with their prior affinity. None of them publicly declared the reason for the conflicts due to the contentious nature of the actions done during their partnership.|$|E
