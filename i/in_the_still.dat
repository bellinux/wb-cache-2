He completed two chair paintings: Van Gogh's Chair and Gauguin's Chair.|$|E
5|$|The Sultanates to {{the north}} of Vijayanagara united and {{attacked}} Aliya Rama Raya's army, in January 1565, in a war known as the Battle of Talikota. The Vijayanagara side was winning the war, state Hermann Kulke and Dietmar Rothermund, but suddenly two Muslim generals of the Vijayanagara army switched sides and turned their loyalty to the Sultanates. The generals captured Aliya Rama Raya and beheaded him on the spot, with Sultan Hussain on the Sultanates side joining them for the execution and stuffing of severed head with straw for display. The beheading of Aliya Rama Raya created confusion and havoc <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>still</b> loyal portions of the Vijayanagara army, which were then completely routed. The Sultanates' army plundered Hampi and reduced it to the ruinous state in which it remains; it was never re-occupied.|$|E
5|$|Luis Rivera {{represented}} Puerto Rico in artistic gymnastics, and was {{the only}} Puerto Rican gymnast to appear at the Beijing Olympics. Born in Humacao, a city on Puerto Rico's southeastern coast, Rivera has been affiliated with the Federación Puertorriqueña de Gimnasia (English: Puerto Rican Federation of Gymnastics) and participated in Beijing at age 21. He had not previously competed in any Olympic games. During the preliminary round, which took place on August 9, Rivera competed against 97 other athletes. During the floor exercise, Rivera scored 15.125 points, placing 24th of the 98 athletes in this event. During the horse vault, Rivera ranked 13th after scoring 16.225 (this was on his first jump; his second jump scored 15.200). Next, during the parallel bars event, Luis Rivera ranked 61st after earning 14.575 points, and later earned 14.675 points in the horizontal bar. Rivera ranked 22nd <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>still</b> rings event after earning 15.250 points and placing 22nd, and finished out the qualification round on the pommel horse by ranking 20th with a score of 14.750. Overall, the Puerto Rican gymnast ranked 13th of the 27 advancing athletes, ending with a total score of 90.600 points. He placed ahead of Russia's Maxim Devyatovskiy (90.350 points) and behind Belarus' Dmitry Savitski (90.650 points). He advanced to the final round.|$|E

5|$|The fleet {{remained}} in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Treaty of Versailles. Von Reuter {{believed that the}} British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919, which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty. Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd, Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity. On the morning of 21 June, the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers, and at 11:20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships. The ship sank in two hours and fifteen minutes. The task of raising Von der Tann was secured by Ernest Cox's salvage company. During preparation work, three workers were nearly killed when their oxy-acetylene cutters set off a major explosion. The blast tore holes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>still</b> submerged vessel and allowed water into the compartment that had been emptied with compressed air; {{by the time the}} men were rescued, the compartment had refilled almost completely and the men were up to their necks. Nevertheless, the ship was successfully brought up on 7 December 1930, and scrapped at Rosyth by the Alloa Shipbreaking Company between 1931 and 1934.|$|E

25|$|Vacationing Uruguayans of {{more modest}} means were {{concentrated}} in smaller resorts such as Piriápolis and Atlántida, which {{are closer to}} Montevideo. Beyond Punta del Este <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>still</b> mostly undeveloped department of Rocha, a number of communities had sprouted along the unspoiled Atlantic coast with its kilometres of sandy beaches and huge breakers. These small vacation communities—such as Aguas Dulces and Cabo Polonio, both in Rocha Department—were entirely unplanned and lacked essential services. In many cases, simple holiday chalets had been built on public property adjoining the seashore without any legal title to the land. In 1990 the authorities in Rocha Department announced plans to regulate and improve this development in hopes of encouraging visits by higher-spending tourists.|$|E
25|$|The highest calibre {{performance}} {{on the second day}} came from Gerd Kanter, whose throw of 69.70m won the men's discus by nearly five metres – only he threw further in the event that year.

Nadzeya Astapchuk also had a duel against Anca Heltne in the women's shot put – in spite of being in comparatively poor form Astapchuk still managed to win by a margin of four centimetres. Mariya Abakumova won the women's javelin, which had only moderate performances <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>still</b> conditions in Los Realejos.|$|E

25|$|Initially {{wine was}} {{distilled}} as a preservation method {{and as a}} way {{to make it easier for}} merchants to transport. It is also thought that wine was originally distilled to lessen the tax which was assessed by volume. The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after having been stored in wooden casks, the resulting product had improved over the original distilled spirit. In addition to removing water, the distillation process led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the composition of the distillate from its source. Non-volatile substances such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>still.</b> As a result, the taste of the distillate was often quite unlike that of the original source.|$|E

25|$|The Proto-Elamite city of Susa {{was founded}} around 4000 BC in the {{watershed}} {{of the river}} Karun. It {{is considered to be}} the site of Proto-Elamite cultural formation. During its early history, it fluctuated between submission to Mesopotamian and Elamite power. The earliest levels (22—17 in the excavations conducted by Le Brun, 1978) exhibit pottery that has no equivalent in Mesopotamia, but for the succeeding period, the excavated material allows identification with the culture of Sumer of the Uruk period. Proto-Elamite influence from the Mesopotamia in Susa becomes visible from about 3200 BC, and texts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>still</b> undeciphered Proto-Elamite writing system continue to be present until about 2700 BC. The Proto-Elamite period ends with the establishment of the Awan dynasty. The earliest known historical figure connected with Elam is the king Enmebaragesi of Kish (c. 2650 BC?), who subdued it, according to the Sumerian king list. Elamite history can only be traced from records dating to beginning of the Akkadian Empire (2335–2154 BC) onwards.|$|E
