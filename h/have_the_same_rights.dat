At the time of this latest expansion coming into effect in April 2006, there were 587 registered couples.|$|E

She was the keynote speaker for the 1997 national Parents, Families, & Friends of Lesbians and Gays (PFLAG) convention, and has since become one of the LGBT community's most vocal advocates. In May 1998, she received the GLAAD Vanguard Award for having [...] "made a significant difference in promoting equal rights for lesbians and gay men".

500|$|The {{economic}} {{prosperity of the}} Song period prompted many families to provide their daughters with larger dowries {{in order to attract}} the wealthiest sons-in-law to provide a stable life of economic security for their daughters. With large amounts of property allotted to a daughter's dowry, her family naturally sought benefits; as a result women's legal claims to property were greatly improved. Under certain circumstances, an unmarried daughter without brothers or a surviving mother without sons could inherit one-half of her father's share of undivided family property Under the Song law code, if an heirless man left no clear successor to his property and household, it was his widowed wife's right to designate her own heir in a process called liji ("adopting an heir"). If an heir was appointed by the parents' relatives after their deaths, the [...] "appointed" [...] heir did not <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rights</b> as a biological son to inherit the estate; instead he shared juehu ("extinct household") property with the parents' daughter(s), if there were any.|$|E

500|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, Onn Ja'afar {{proposed}} to open UMNO membership to all Malayans, and renaming it the United Malayan National Organisation, {{which would have}} diluted its identity {{as a champion of}} ketuanan Melayu. Defeated in an internal power struggle, he resigned in 1951 to found the Independence of Malaya Party (IMP). He was succeeded by Tunku Abdul Rahman (often known as [...] "the Tunku"), who insisted on initial Malay sovereignty. Expressing concern over a lack of loyalty to Malaya among non-Malays, he demanded they clarify their allegiance before being accorded citizenship, going on to state: [...] "For those who love and feel they owe undivided loyalty to this country, we will welcome them as Malayans. They must truly be Malayans, and they will <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rights</b> and privileges as the Malays." [...] Not long after, in 1952, however, he appeared to contradict himself, and insisted that Malays safeguard their special position: [...] "Malaya is for the Malays and it should not be governed by a mixture of races." ...|$|E
500|$|During {{his time}} in Congress, Gore was {{considered}} a [...] "moderate" [...] (he once referred to himself as a [...] "raging moderate") opposing federal funding of abortion, voting {{in favor of a}} bill which supported a moment in silence in schools, and voting against a ban on interstate sales of guns. In 1981, Gore was quoted as saying with regard to homosexuality, [...] "I think it is wrong", and [...] "I don't pretend to understand it, but it is not just another normal optional life style." [...] In his 1984 Senate race, Gore said when discussing homosexuality, [...] "I do not believe it is simply an acceptable alternative that society should affirm." [...] He also said that he would not take campaign funds from gay rights groups. Although he maintained a position against homosexuality and gay marriage in the 1980s, Gore said in 2008 that he thinks [...] "gay men and women ought to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rights</b> as heterosexual men and women...to join together in marriage." [...] His position as a moderate (and on policies related to that label) shifted later in life after he became Vice President and ran for president in 2000.|$|E
500|$|Beginning in late 2002, Gore {{began to}} {{publicly}} criticize the Bush administration. In a September 23, 2002, speech given before the Commonwealth Club of California, Gore criticized President George W. Bush and Congress for {{the rush to}} war prior to the outbreak of hostilities in Iraq. He compared this decision to the Persian Gulf War (which Gore had voted for) stating, [...] "Back in 1991, I {{was one of a}} handful of Democrats in the United States Senate to vote in favor of the resolution endorsing the Persian Gulf War [...] But look at the differences between the resolution that was voted on in 1991 and the one this administration is proposing that the Congress vote on in 2002. The circumstances are really completely different. To review a few of them briefly: in 1991, Iraq had crossed an international border, invaded a neighboring sovereign nation and annexed its territory. Now by contrast in 2002, there has been no such invasion." [...] In a speech given in 2004, during the presidential election, Gore accused George W. Bush of betraying the country by using the 9/11 attacks as a justification for the invasion of Iraq. The next year, Gore gave a speech which covered many topics, including what he called [...] "religious zealots" [...] who claim special knowledge of God's will in American politics. Gore stated: [...] "They even claim that those of us who disagree with their point of view are waging war against people of faith." [...] After Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Gore chartered two planes to evacuate 270 people from New Orleans and criticized the Bush administration's response to the hurricane. In 2006, Gore criticized Bush's use of domestic wiretaps without a warrant. One month later, in a speech given at the Jeddah Economic Forum, Gore criticized the treatment of Arabs in the U.S. after 9/11 stating, [...] "Unfortunately there have been terrible abuses and it's wrong [...] I do want you to know that it does not represent the desires or wishes or feelings of the majority of the citizens of my country." [...] Gore's 2007 book, The Assault on Reason, is an analysis of what Gore refers to as the [...] "emptying out of the marketplace of ideas" [...] in civic discourse during the Bush administration. He attributes this phenomenon to the influence of television and argues that it endangers American democracy. By contrast, Gore argues, the Internet can revitalize and ultimately [...] "redeem the integrity of representative democracy." [...] In 2008, Gore argued against the ban of same-sex marriage on his Current TV website, stating, [...] "I think that gay men and women ought to <b>have</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>rights</b> as heterosexual men and women to make contracts, have hospital visiting rights, and join together in marriage." [...] In a 2009 interview with CNN, Gore commented on former Vice President Dick Cheney's criticism of the Obama administration. Referring to his own previous criticism of the Bush administrations, Gore stated: [...] "I waited two years after I left office to make statements that were critical, and then of the policy [...] You know, you talk about somebody that shouldn't be talking about making the country less safe, invading a country that did not attack us and posed no serious threat to us at all." ...|$|E
