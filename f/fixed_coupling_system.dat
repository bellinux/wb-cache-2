40|$|The superconducting {{instability}} in a non-Fermi liquid in d> 1 is considered. For a {{particular form of}} the single particle spectral function with homogeneous scaling A(Λ k, Λω) = Λ^α A(k, ω) it is shown that the pair susceptibility is also a scaling function of temperature with power defined by α. We find three different regimes depending on the scaling constant. The BCS result is recovered for α = - 1 and it corresponds to a marginal scaling of the coupling constant. For α > - 1 the superconducting transition happens above some critical coupling. In the opposite case of α < - 1 for any <b>fixed</b> <b>coupling</b> the <b>system</b> undergoes a transition at low temperatures. Possible implications for theories of high-T_c with a superconducting transition driven by the interlayer Josephson tunneling are discussed. 1 ps file for fig is attached {{at the bottom of}} the tex file.

40|$|In {{this work}} the {{nonlinear}} {{behavior of a}} coupled reactor-separator network is analyzed using singularity and bifurcation theory. The reactor is modeled as a CSTR, which sustains an exothermic first order reaction. The separator is modeled as a flash process. The effluent from the reactor is fed to the separator. The reactant rich stream (assumed to be the bottoms) from the separator isrecycled back to the reactor. Focus is on pure mass recycle, as the two units are decoupled energetically via heat exchangers. Two different modes of operation are considered. These are compared {{with each other and}} with the well known stand alone reactor with a first order exothermic reaction. For the first mode of operation, the feed rate is fixed and for the second the recycle rate is fixed. In practice, these different modes of operation can be achieved by a suitable control strategy. It is shown that the behavior crucially depends on the mode of operation. Fixing the feed rate can lead to severe operational problems including monotonic and oscillatory unstable steady statesover a wide range of operating conditions. Further, parameterregions are identified, where no steady state exists at all. On the other hand when the recycle rate is <b>fixed</b> the <b>coupled</b> <b>system</b> admits at least one stable steady state solution for a fixed set of operating conditions. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd.

40|$|SUMMARY <b>Fixed</b> <b>coupled</b> {{ventricular}} premature depolarizations (VPDs) {{are usually}} considered reentrant; recent experimental models {{have demonstrated that}} parasystolic rhythms may also appear in <b>fixed</b> <b>coupled</b> patterns. To analyze the mechanisms of <b>fixed</b> <b>coupled</b> VPDs, 60 exercise tests were chosen to evaluate the response of VPD coupling intervals to changes in cycle length of the dominant supraventricular rhythm. Selec-tion criteria included the presence of frequent, unifocal VPDs that were <b>fixed</b> <b>coupled</b> (variation 0. 9) of coupling intervals to cycle length; 2) 16 patients with <b>coupling</b> intervals <b>fixed,</b> independent of cycle length; and 3) 12 patients with no consistent relation {{over a wide range}} of cycle lengths. Two patients in group 2 and four in group 3 fulfilled criteria for parasystole with interectopic intervals that remained constant at different cycle lengths. These results suggest that VPDs in group I are reentrant, while some patients with group 2 or 3 responses have evidence for parasystolic rhythms. We conclude that 1) <b>fixed</b> <b>coupling</b> of VPDs is not diagnostic of reentry, and 2) changes in cycle length induced with exercise may be useful in the analysis of mechanisms of VPDs.

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} pinning control problem of <b>coupled</b> {{dynamical}} <b>systems</b> with stochastically switching couplings and stochastically selected controller–node set. Here, the coupling matrices and the controller–node sets change with time, induced by a continuous-time Markov chain. By constructing Lyapunov functions, we establish tractable sufficient conditions for exponential {{stability of the}} <b>coupled</b> <b>system.</b> Two scenarios are considered here. First, we prove that if each subsystem in the switching system, i. e. with the <b>fixed</b> <b>coupling,</b> can be stabilized by the fixed pinning controller–node set, and in addition, the Markovian switching is sufficiently slow, then the time-varying dynamical system is stabilized. Second, we conclude that if the system with the average coupling and pinning gains can be stabilized and the switching is sufficiently fast, the time-varying system is stabilized. Two numerical examples are provided {{to demonstrate the validity}} of these theoretical results, including a switching dynamical system between several stable subsystems, and a dynamical system with mobile nodes and spatial pinning control towards the nodes when these nodes are being in a pre-designed region...|$|R

40|$|There {{are several}} methods in dynamic substructuring for {{numerical}} simulation of complex {{structures in the}} low-frequency range, {{that is to say}} in the modal range. For instance, the Craig-Bampton method is a very efficient and popular method in linear structural dynamics. Such a method is based {{on the use of the}} first structural modes of each substructure with <b>fixed</b> <b>coupling</b> interface.

In general, the study of ISS for CCSs is complex, because it is very difficult to straightly construct an appropriate Lyapunov function for CCSs. However, in [5], Li and Shuai studied the global-stability problem of equilibrium and developed a systematic approach that allows one to construct global Lyapunov functions for large-scale <b>coupled</b> <b>systems</b> from building blocks of individual vertex systems.
