5000|$|The {{interior}} is trimmed in red leather, black accents, brushed aluminum, and borders on parody with red leather racing style seats draped over black forms atop aluminum pedestals. Similarly, the <b>dash</b> <b>pad</b> [...] "eyebrows" [...] overlook a metal band containing the gauges and vents, {{and the red}} lower section.|$|E
50|$|A raised roof for {{extended}} headroom {{was added to}} the options list in 1968. Starting with the 1970 model year, the engine was now accessed from outside the vehicle, and the front doors were conventionally hinged. To enhance safety a full padded <b>dash</b> <b>pad</b> was introduced, sharing the dashboard panel from the new R - 2.|$|E
5000|$|Codenamed [...] "8VK19 A9W", it {{was based}} on a Commodore Executive but {{upgraded}} to the S pack. In addition to body coloured wheel covers, bumper bars and bonnet garnish the car also featured the HSV 8 Plus grille, SV3800 red and silver pin stripes and Challenger decal pack on driver's side of the bootlid and trailing edges of rear doors below the body mouldings. It was only available in Alpine White and the interior featured a black Calais steering wheel, rear headrests and Challenger badge in <b>dash</b> <b>pad.</b>|$|E
5000|$|... 1956: $10,000 ($, {{adjusted}} for inflation) Lincoln Continental Mark II introduced. Ford goes public with common stock shares. Ford's emphasis on safety with its Lifeguard option package, including seat belts and <b>dash</b> <b>padding,</b> earns the company Motor Trends [...] "Car of the Year" [...] award.|$|R
50|$|An {{electrically}} operated sliding steel sunroof was optional in 1962, the second automobile {{model in the}} world to have this option. The styling offered more interior and cargo room than the original Karmann Ghia. It featured an electric clock, three luggage spaces, built-in fog lights, round tail lights, upper and lower <b>dash</b> <b>pads,</b> door pads, and long padded armrests. It was the fastest production VW model of its day.|$|R
5000|$|... 1978: All models {{now have}} hydragas {{suspension}} instead of previous hydrolastic system, and all models now feature electric windscreen washers. The HL loses its {{three-spoke steering wheel}} and a walnut finish <b>dash</b> replaces its <b>padded</b> <b>dash.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Lancer {{wheelbase}} {{and body}} shell were {{identical to those}} of the Valiant, but interior and exterior trim were fancier on the Lancer. Lancers featured round taillights and a full-width grille, instead of the Valiant's cat's-eye taillights and central grille. For 1961, trim levels were the basic [...] "170" [...] and the premium [...] "770". In 1961, the two-door hardtop was marketed only as the [...] "Lancer 770 2-Door Hardtop". For 1962, the hardtop model was marketed as the [...] "GT 2-Door Hardtop" [...] and carried premium trim. Two-tone paint was available and instead of the front bench seat, there were two bucket seats. Also for the 1962 model, [...] "Lancer GT" [...] medallions were mounted on the doors' interior trim panels below the vent window and {{on the sides of the}} front fenders just aft of the headlamps. [...] "GT" [...] emblems were placed on the hood, the deck lid and on the vinyl <b>dash</b> <b>pad.</b> The headlamp bezels and the grille's horizontal slats were blacked-out. The GT also lacked certain ornamentation found on the 170s and 770s such as the [...] "Lancer" [...] door scripts, the slanted chrome hash marks on the lower quarter panel, and the hook-ended stainless steel door-to-fender spears.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike the {{television}} show era Lees, the movie cars used aftermarket graphic kits. The movie gave them new credibility {{and is no longer}} considered to be an inaccurate choice. Otherwise, except for the white letters on the Goodrich [...] "Radial T/A" [...] tires, the exterior of the movie's [...] "close-up" [...] General Lees varied little from {{the television}} show cars. The paint was [...] "Hemi Orange" [...] (an American Motors Corporation color) rather than Corvette [...] "Flame Red"; the interior headliner was black instead of tan, an actual roll cage was used; a three-spoke Grant wood-trimmed steering wheel replaced the standard wheel, an AM/FM stereo radio with Compact Disc player was installed in the dashboard; and the interiors were a custom color vinyl fabric made to look like the dye/paint used in the later eras of the TV show. One still can differentiate the 1968 Chargers by looking at the <b>dash</b> <b>pad,</b> but now 1970 Chargers were thrown in the mix. The cars somewhat resembled a late 1990s to early 2000s (decade) General Lee clone, but the overall flavor of the General Lee is still obvious. On all of the cars, the back-up lights and side marker lenses were removed, the openings filled in.|$|E
5000|$|Although Allender's {{cars were}} merely {{customized}} Chevys, {{they were all}} professionally hand-built and carefully detailed. Allender used [...] "old stock" [...] parts where it was possible; for example, the [...] "Dagmar" [...] front bumper guards were 1937 Dodge headlight pods. Taillights for the '56 cars were 1955 Dodge units. A Frazer horn button served for a front medallion, and [...] "saddle" [...] pieces {{on the front door}} came from <b>dash</b> <b>padding</b> on the Willys auto. Drive trains for all El Moroccos were strictly stock Chevrolet. Standard was the Chevrolet small-block V8 with four-barrel carburetor, and Powerglide automatic transmission.|$|R
50|$|The Golden Hawks were 203.9 in long. A <b>padded</b> <b>dash</b> was standard.|$|R

Standard tire size was 8.55 x 14inches. A new three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic automatic transmission with torque converter replaced the dismal three speed Roto Hydramatic that Oldsmobile {{had been using}} {{for the last three}} model years. Along with the transmission and redesigned platform, the engine was also new for 1965. It was a [...] Super Rocket V8 that was more powerful and of a more efficient design than the older [...] Rocket V8 previously used, yet it was much lighter in weight. The 98's standard and only engine offering for 1965 was the four-barrel [...] "Ultra High Compression" [...] version of the 425 Super Rocket rated at [...] Ninety-Eights were built only in Lansing.|$|R

The interior featured an electric clock as a standard feature; a <b>padded</b> <b>dash</b> was optional.|$|R
5000|$|The 1953 Henry J Corsair had few styling {{changes and}} {{featured}} the smaller L-head four-cylinder engine. Kaiser's advertising promoted it as [...] "the easiest {{car on the}} road to drive, handle, park, service, run, maintain, and of course the easiest to pay for." [...] A <b>padded</b> <b>dash</b> became standard.|$|R
50|$|Toward {{the end of}} 1974, an {{up-market}} 968A debuted, surviving until 1979. Among its improvements were <b>padded</b> <b>dash,</b> energy-absorbing (collapsing) steering column, and seats {{from the}} VAZ-2101. The export 968E (destined mostly for the Eastern Bloc) had headlights able to meet international standards, a safety glass windscreen, and anti-theft steering lock.|$|R
50|$|Like all cars {{sold in the}} U.S. for 1967, the 4-4-2 came {{standard}} with a {{group of}} occupant protection and accident avoidance features as mandated by Federal law.

50|$|In {{an attempt}} to attract buyers, Chrysler offered the 1959 DeSoto Firedome in 26 solid colors and 190 {{two-tone}} finishes. By {{the end of the}} 1959 model year, Chrysler was struggling to find buyers for its DeSoto automobiles. Despite the wide variety of models available, consumers shunned DeSoto automobiles as rumor circulated that Chrysler would phase out the marque. A <b>padded</b> <b>dash</b> was standard.|$|R
