5|$|Production {{methods for}} the {{elements}} less frequently recognised as metalloids involve natural processing, electrolytic or chemical reduction, or irradiation. Carbon (as graphite) occurs naturally and <b>is</b> <b>extracted</b> by crushing the parent rock and floating the lighter graphite to the surface. Aluminium <b>is</b> <b>extracted</b> by dissolving its oxide Al2O3 in molten cryolite Na3AlF6 {{and then by}} high temperature electrolytic reduction. Selenium is produced by roasting the coinage metal selenides X2Se (X = Cu, Ag, Au) with soda ash to give the selenite: X2Se + O2 + Na2CO3 → Na2SeO3 + 2 X + CO2; the selenide is neutralized by sulfuric acid H2SO4 to give selenous acid H2SeO3; this is reduced by bubbling with SO2 to yield elemental selenium. Polonium and astatine are produced in minute quantities by irradiating bismuth.|$|E

If a primary tooth <b>is</b> <b>extracted</b> before its succeeding permanent tooth's root reaches ⅓ of its total growth, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be delayed. Conversely, if {{the roots of the}} permanent tooth are more than ⅔ complete, the eruption of the permanent tooth will be accelerated.

5|$|CSF can {{be tested}} for the {{diagnosis}} {{of a variety of}} neurological diseases, usually obtained by a procedure called lumbar puncture. Lumbar puncture is carried out under sterile conditions by inserting a needle into the subarachnoid space, usually between the third and fourth lumbar vertebrae.

Albumins and globulins <b>were</b> first <b>extracted</b> with 5. 0 % NaCl and hordeins (barley prolamins) <b>were</b> <b>extracted</b> with 55. 0 % 1 -propanol in the presence, or absence, of 1. 0 % DTT. Glutelins <b>were</b> then <b>extracted</b> with 2. 0 % DS/ 6. () M urea/ 1. 0 % DTT or with 55. 0 % 1 -propanol/ 6. 0 M urea/ 1. 0 % DTT/ 0. 036 M Tris-HCl (pH 8. 4). Under non-reducing conditions, monomeric C hordeins and some B hordeins <b>were</b> <b>extracted</b> from unmalted barley, whereas most if not all B, C and D hordeins <b>were</b> <b>extracted</b> under reducing conditions. During malting, disulfide bonds are reduced and B and D hordeins are broken down by proteolysis. No D hordeins <b>were</b> <b>extracted</b> from malt and nearly the same levels of malt B hordeins <b>were</b> <b>extracted</b> both under non-reducing and reducing conditions. B hordeins present in BSG proteins were only extractable under reducing conditions. Whereas most of the C hordeins <b>were</b> <b>extracted</b> from BSG under non-reducing conditions, more C hordeins <b>were</b> <b>extracted</b> under reducing conditions. Mashing probably induced disulfide bond formation resulting in aggregation. Although earlier literature suggested the formation of an aggregate composed of B and D hordein (and glutelin) during mashing, the present work suggests the formation of an aggregate composed of B hordeins in which C hordeins are entrapped.
