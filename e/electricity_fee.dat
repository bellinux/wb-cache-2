40|$|Abstract: Lead is {{a highly}} toxic heavy metal. The {{investigation}} was conducted to remove Pb(II) from storage battery industry wastewater by using electrodialysis (ED) in laboratory. The storage battery industry wastewater has an initial Pb(II) concentration of 8. 5 mg/L. The performance of ED is determined {{by a set of}} fixed and variable process parameters such as inlet concentration, operating current density, and operating flow rate. Like all the efficient ED operations, the process has to be optimized in terms of overall costs considering cell component designs and properties as well as all operating parameters. Under the conditions of operating current density at 3 A/cm 2, liquid flow rate of 300 L/h and circulation time of 5 ~ 6, the Pb(II) concentration of storage battery industrial outlet wastewater can be reduced to below 0. 01 mg/L and the conductivity could be reduced below 10 µs/cm. The treated water could be reused in the manufacture of storage battery. A mathematical correlationship of Jlim＝ 10. 379 V 0. 5324 C, which described the characteristics of the equipment, was finally obtained. The results showed that Pb(II) wastewater of the storage battery industry could be effective treated by ED and the separation process presented several advantages such as highly selective desalination, high water recovery and the possibility of an intermittent operation. Operation cost of the EDR mini-plant was also estimated in this project. Total operation cost including <b>electricity</b> <b>fee</b> and chemical cost is about $ 0. 102 /m 3 of treated water...|$|E

An experimental platform was established for conducting tests, observing cooling efficiencies, and calculating power saving statuses. Comparing the observed cooling efficiency, a temperature difference of 5. 4  °C was determined before and after the application; this is significant regarding efficiency.

30|$|The {{entire group}} of {{consumers}} {{can be divided}} into three types (i.e., industrial, commercial and household), the responsive potential of which differs a lot, reflected by the variation in the parameters. Factors affecting the parameters of the responsive model include the business type, production procedure, and the proportion of electricity cost in total cost, etc. [30]. For example, in iron manufacturing industry, high electricity quality and reliability are required, and the proportion of shiftable load is limited. Thus the maximum shift rate and limit value are relatively small. In contrast, cement enterprises usually work on three shifts, and the electricity expense makes up approximately 15 % of total expense. In this case, they are more willing to transfer load for the purpose of cutting down <b>electricity</b> <b>fees,</b> and the limit value and the maximum rate are larger. As for commercial and domestic users, a large part of electricity is consumed by air conditioning and lighting equipment, of which the response potential is considerable.

40|$|This diploma thesis, {{explores the}} {{possibility}} of a Cold Ironing installation in Thessaloniki’s port from a Cost-Benefit perspective. At first a feasibility study is conducted {{in order to determine the}} cost of implementing on-shore power supply to the port. An additional investment in a Photovoltaic Park within the port, in the context of moving forward a greener path, as well as for financial profitability, has also been investigated. However, the nature of such an investment is more environmental rather than financial. Therefore, the external benefits for Human health, environment, society and ecosystem have to be examined carefully before reaching a decision. The comparison between actual monetary and beneficial monetary outcomes, is quite a difficult task and the result may vary from a different perspective. Nevertheless, it is more than clear that the environmental benefits for Thessaloniki –a town which has already quite insulted atmosphere- are great. Moreover, in order to connect these advantages with a profitable investment strategy, numerous scenarios and possibilities have been analysed. The problem arises when electricity prices of on-board and on-shore generated sources are compared. Currently on-shore generated power is much more expensive than on-board. Therefore, shipowners are unlikely to use the facilities if there lays a loss. The most important step to make it a vital solution for both port administrators and ship-owners is that of introducing a special tax exception in <b>electricity</b> <b>fee.</b> That way, the cost between on-shore generated and on-board generated could be competitive for ship owners, and it depends on the percentage of reduction the profitability of the port...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} is an analysis, {{assuming the}} framework of Government and Binding Theory, of the syntactic derivation of comparative correlative constructions (hereafter CCs for short) in Mandarin Chinese. It attempts to evaluate the theoretical adequacy of extant treatments of CCs and propose an alternative analysis to the prevailing adjunct approach. CC constructions exist crosslinguistically. An English example is The more chocolate I eat, the happier I feel. In Chinese, a simplex CC sentence consists of two non-coordinated clauses; the lexical word yue, which indicates degree, is obligatory in both clauses, as illustrated in (1) : (1) tianqi yue₁ re, dian-fei yue₂ gao. weather [YUE₁ hot], electricity-fee [YUE₂ high] `The hotter the weather is, the higher the <b>electricity</b> <b>fee</b> is. ' Unlike the English comparative phrase, which {{has been shown to}} undergo A-bar movement in earlier studies, the yue-constituent remains in situ. I argue that yue is generated in [Spec, DegP] and behaves as an indefinite in-situ degree element on a par with an in-situ wh-element (Li 1992; Tsai 1994; Cheng and Rooryck 2000; Cheng 2003 a, 2003 b). The yue-variable in each clause is unselectively bound (Lewis 1975, Heim 1982, Cheng and Huang 1996) by an implicit CORRELATIVITY OPERATOR and does not undergo A-bar movement. In addition to the idiosyncratic in-situ yue-phrase, another property of CCs is the syntactic interdependency between the constitutive clauses. Earlier studies (Dikken 2005, Taylor 2006, 2009, Tsao and Hsiao 2002) treat the preceding clause as an adjunct. However, an adjunct approach cannot account for the property of syntactic interdependency. As an alternative, I assume Rizzi's (1997) work on the Split CP Hypothesis, arguing that Chinese CCs implicate the information structure in the left periphery and that they are a type of Focus construction. A Chinese CC sentence like (1) is projected by a null functional head Foc⁰. The first clause is focused and base-generated in [Spec, FocP] and the second clause is the complement of the null Foc⁰. The [+focus]feature in Foc⁰ licenses the co-occurrence of yue₁ and yue₂. This alternative analysis can capture not only crosslinguistic commonalities but also the language-internal property of topic-prominence in Chinese...|$|E
40|$|Riksbyggen Fastighetsservice is {{a company}} whose {{businesses}} cope with building construction and related services. The local office of Riksbyggen Fastighetsservice in Gävle has been studied in this project. The local office locates in Näringen 20 : 4, which was constructed in 1989.   The aim of this project {{is to make a}} diagnosis of the current situation; find out the most applicable way of optimizing the operation of the facility {{in order to reduce the}} energy consumption, to study costs and possible savings and provide assistance with future energy management.       Firstly, a study of Energy Balance was conducted. The transmission losses was 57761 KWh; mechanical ventilation losses 3855 KWh; hot tap water heat losses 9579 KWh; natural transmission and infiltration 6897 KWh. On the other hand, heat gain from internal heat was 12707 KWh; solar radiation 8521 KWh; and supply heat 56806 KWh.   Secondly, the energy costs have been checked out. 29655 KWh of electricity was consumed in 2008. 5948 KWh was used by 20 fuses electricity and 23707 KWh was for 25 fuses. Lighting, electrical equipment and machine composed the electricity consumption. Lighting consumes 13278 KWh; equipment consumes 6452 KWh; and machine consumes 9925 KWh. Lighting electricity was composed by office lighting and workshop lighting with 4798 KWh and 8480 KWh respectively.   Electricity cost is very complicated and flexible in Sweden according to effect and consumption. The total cost of electricity consists of electricity commerce fee and electricity transmission net. Electricity commerce fee includes annual fixed fee, <b>electricity</b> <b>fee,</b> energy certificate and tax. Electricity transmission fee includes annual fixed transmission fee, grid fee and tax. Tax plays vital important role which results in huge total cost. The local office spent 43356 kr on electricity in 2008. 4798 kr was spent on office lighting, and 8480 kr was spent on workshop lighting.   On the other hand district heating fee is composed by annual fixed fee, effect fee, energy fee and tax. The local office spent 37142 kr on 56. 806 MWh of district heating in 2008. Thus, the local office purchased 86461 KWh of energies and spent 80498 kr in total in 2008.   Thirdly, to assist its energy traces and management, three tables were designed. One table is for annual energy consumption and cost in each month with all information of sub-terms on costs. One table is for annual electricity consumption for each electrical equipment and cost in accordance. Another table is for district heating consumption and cost.     At last, energy saving possibilities was explored. One way is applying improvements or maintenance of the office construction. The result of Energy Balance shows that transmission losses were 57761 KWh which occupies 74 % of the total losses, and it is the biggest bite. As the office was constructed in 1989, if improvements and maintenance can be applied to the insulation of floor, roof and walls, or change the windows, the heat losses can be reduced.   However, the other solution might be much more applicable and financial sound. Just go to Clas Ohlson to buy LED 1 W and 3 W lamps to replace the current bulbs. Spending 3009 kr to buy 51 LED incandescent bulbs of 1 W effect, and 3576 kr on 24 LED fluorescent of 3 W effect, will save 12057 kr every year. The lighting electricity consumption will be reduced from 13278 KWh / year to 264 KWh / year. Instead of spending 16017 kr on lighting, 98 % will be reduced, and only 318 kr will be paid. Moreover, the payback is really nice, only 0. 42 year. Action! The sooner the better! 20 % of energy cost will be saved...|$|E

40|$|When {{people try}} to manage limited {{resources}} together, why do they sometimes fail and sometimes succeed? Since the time of Aristotle, scholars and laymen alike have twisted their minds around the subject. With the frightening prospect of severe future climate change, a growing world population, and steadily increased stress on global resources, the significance of securing "our common future" only grows by the day. In the remote islands of the Sunderban delta of West Bengal, India, 4. 5 million people live and work without access to the national electricity grid. The inhabitants use sources of fuel like kerosene, wood and cow dung. As customers of off-grid solar PV mini-grids, installed {{by the state and}} other implementing agencies, some now have access to electricity. Between 1996 and 2011, 18 solar mini-grids were installed on the islands, supplying each customer with 70 - 200 W daily. The power plants have limited capacity, and tariffs are based on flat rates. Customers are not allowed to consume more electricity than the agreed upon limit, but in most cases, no current meters or circuit breakers have been installed. The high level of compliance throughout the past decade has surprised both scholars and practitioners, who have characterized the supply systems as a "rural electrification story". However, the situation has gradually changed. Customers have stopped paying <b>electricity</b> <b>fees,</b> started consuming more electricity than allowed, and stretched illegal cables over to their neighbors. At the same time, the capacity of the mini-grids has declined. This gives rise to the question: why did the customers comply with the agreements for a decade, and then stop complying, {{while at the same time}} knowing that their actions would negatively affect supply? A multiple case study from three Sunderban Islands was conducted to shed light on this question. Thirty-four interviews were conducted during fieldwork in August 2011, with people involved at all levels of the supply chain - customers, operators, monitors, funders and implementing agencies. By employing data from fieldwork and earlier research on the subject, variations in compliance between contexts and in time are explored. Questions like the ones posed in this thesis are extensively discussed within the field of common resource management. To answer the research question, the thesis starts with common resource literature and aims to take an explorative approach to the subject. Trust is identified as a useful concept to trace the variables affecting the variations in levels of compliance. By employing trust as an analytic concept, the thesis finds that compliance has been influenced by a combination of factors, with different combinations of variables leading to different outcomes between contexts and in time. Levels of compliance have varied with capacity of the technology, the type of institutional set-up, degree of and type of enforcement, customers’ knowledge and expectations of the technology, and expectations of other customers' and institutions' actions. In addition, the situation found in the Sunderban Islands has been shaped by global developments in recent decades, affecting the customers' general hopes and dreams for their lives...|$|R

They are utilized for generation of electricity, transport and for household use. With the exception of charcoal and fire wood, all the others are imported from outside and huge amounts of hard currency is expended on their importation.Like other regions, charcoal and fire woods are the main fuel sources utilized for household, businesses and other institutions that are involved in food services in the region. Charcoal consumption is the highest in the urban centers while fire wood is mainly used in rural areas. Charcoal and firewood fuels have had an utter deforestation in the region.Borama town used to have electricity power station known as Borama Power Station. It was established just before the Socialist Regime came into power in 1969. It was used for lighting public houses and the main streets of the town. The station was expanded in the 1980s by Henley on Thames (UK) a sister city of Borama. Henley on Thames provided two electricity generators of 1500 KVAs each and their spare parts and accessories awaiting installation.After the collapse of the Socialist Regime in 1990, private individuals joined together and took over the power station and had been providing <b>electricity</b> for <b>fee</b> up to 2003.

The many attempts of forming public- private - partnership (PPP) with private companies by Borama Municipality, representing Borama Power Station, ended in vain.

An ever-increasing number of electric and plug-in electric vehicles (EVs and PEVs) will radically change the traditional view of the transportation industry, social environment, and business world. Research on grid integration of EVs and PEVs typically addresses topics at the vehicle-grid boundary such as peak load impacts and optimal charging control. While researchers {{around the world are}} making significant advances in these areas, there is very little work investigating the customer behavior in competitive EV charging and parking services. On one hand, as a transportation tool and electricity carrier, EV can be charged at any charging facility and at any time, which brings spatial and temporal demand uncertainty to the service providers. On the other hand, the retail electricity price and parking fee may have an impact on customer behavior, eventually leading to a change in the expected profits of the service providers. In this thesis, the dynamic interactions between service providers and customers are studied and modeled using game theory. In the above mentioned competition, the players decide their own strategies (i. e., retail <b>electricity</b> price, parking <b>fee,</b> and rebate) while considering a variety of physical constraints such as transformer capacity. The customer segmentation is also taken into consideration. More specifically, the competitive market is studied using a non-cooperative Bertrand game.

The objective {{of this study was}} to analyze the performance of a heat and power generating sludge combustion plant from technical and economical viewpoints and to compare the studied concept to optional sludge treatment technologies. The plant performance was modeled for sewage sludge produced by approximately 200 000 inhabitants. Two plant sizes below 1 000 kWe range were investigated, the smaller plant using sludge as the only fuel and the larger plant with wood chips as the additional fuel. The plants were compared with heat-only plants of similar size. The payback periods for heat-only plants are typically shorter than with the cogenerating plants because the changes in plant investment affect stronger the economy than do the revenues from selling <b>electricity.</b> The gate <b>fee</b> of sludge treatment has the strongest effect on the payback period. The selection of the plant concept (cogeneration, heat only or pure electricity generation) is, however, affected more by the local demand of heat and electricity than pure economy. The selection of the optimal technology for sludge treatment is a complicated task. The studied concept can be the optimal choice, for example, if there is no cement kiln or co-combustion possibility near the source of sludge, if there is no land enhancement demand for the digested sludge, or if the energy surplus from combustion compared to anaerobic digestion is considered more valuable than nutrient recovery possibility from digestion. If the new technology concept is found competitive, it still has to meet the challenge of acceptability from the business, social and cultural points of view...|$|R
