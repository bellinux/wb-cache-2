5|$|An area {{in which}} the island {{operates}} as a single market is electricity. For much of their existence <b>electricity</b> <b>networks</b> in the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland were entirely separate. Both networks were designed and constructed independently post partition. However, as a result of changes over recent years they are now connected with three interlinks and also connected through Great Britain to mainland Europe. The situation in Northern Ireland is complicated by the issue of private companies not supplying Northern Ireland Electricity (NIE) with enough power. In the Republic of Ireland, the ESB has failed to modernise its power stations and the availability of power plants has recently averaged only 66%, one of the worst such rates in Western Europe. EirGrid is building a HVDC transmission line between Ireland and Great Britain with a capacity of 500 MW, about 10% of Ireland's peak demand.|$|E
25|$|Sebastian Ziani de Ferranti, born in Liverpool in 1864, was an {{electrical}} engineer who designed the layout for Deptford Power Station, the first alternating current power station {{in the world in}} 1887, and whose design all others would follow; his later company Ferranti, of Oldham, would later be an industry leader in Britain's defence electronics, on the FTSE 100 Index. Ferranti's design of increasing AC voltage to high tension at the power station, to be stepped-down at a transformer at substations before entering properties, is the system all <b>electricity</b> <b>networks</b> take today; the system reduces wasteful heating of electricity transmission cables.|$|E
25|$|While many {{hydroelectric}} projects supply public <b>electricity</b> <b>networks,</b> {{some are}} created to serve specific industrial enterprises. Dedicated hydroelectric projects are often built {{to provide the}} substantial amounts of electricity needed for aluminium electrolytic plants, for example. The Grand Coulee Dam switched to support Alcoa aluminium in Bellingham, Washington, United States for American World War II airplanes before it was allowed to provide irrigation and power to citizens (in addition to aluminium power) after the war. In Suriname, the Brokopondo Reservoir was constructed to provide electricity for the Alcoa aluminium industry. New Zealand's Manapouri Power Station was constructed to supply electricity to the aluminium smelter at Tiwai Point.|$|E

This system was build for monitoring area that the <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> is interrupted. The long distance monitoring or telemetry was conducted by exploiting two panels monitoring <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> failure which consists of transformer, battery charger, storage battery, power supply, relay, and microcontroller. Battery charger was used for filling up storage battery at voltage storage battery is down, otomatically. Storage battery was used for turn on power supply. The result of monitoring from two panels is read and translated by microcontroller. Data from microcontroller was converted by converter from serial to TCP/IP. Data is then send using access point and that accepted by Wi-Fi with the frequency 2, 4 GHZ. The result is presented in computer by Borland Delphi 7. 0 program. The result of examination showed that monitoring system of <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> failure is succeed realization and could monitore <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> failure...|$|R

30|$|The optimal {{operation}} of the <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> {{plays a significant role}} because the <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> is the main network included in the IES. The optimal operation is concerned with optimizing the generation dispatch of the distributed generators, the real power loss of each transmission line, the voltage stability of each node, and the power quality of each bus. In addition, the operation must satisfy a set of constraints. The corresponding objectives and constraints formulated for the model of the <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> are described in the following sections.|$|R
2500|$|In 1903, the two hamlets (around the Church and Belœil-Station), {{dissatisfied}} with the aqueduct service in the parish municipality of Saint-Mathieu-de-Belœil, requested and were granted permission to become the village of Belœil, whose population reached nearly 700 inhabitants in 1911. By 1914, the village had grown further, sufficiently so to become the ville (city) of Belœil. Over these early years, the city developed its aqueduct and <b>electricity</b> <b>networks.</b> The city remained largely isolated from Montreal, except by train, owing to poorly organized road connections. [...] The opening, in 1940, of the then-Route 9, today Quebec route 116, provided a first direct link to Montreal and, by the 1950s, the population had grown to nearly 6,000 inhabitants, and the two hamlets had grown into a single town. The construction, in 1964, of the Quebec Autoroute 20 freeway linking Montreal to Quebec and passing just north of Beloeil, the population of Beloeil tripled {{over the next three}} decades as it became part of the Montreal suburbs.|$|E

40|$|A Monte Carlo {{model of}} the {{combined}} GB gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> was developed to determine {{the reliability of the}} energy infrastructure. The model integrates the gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> into a single sequential Monte Carlo simulation.

The Monte Carlo model calculates reliability indices such as loss of load probability and expected energy unserved for the combined gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>network.</b> The intention of this tool is to facilitate reliability analysis of integrated energy systems. Applications of this tool are demonstrated through a case study that quantifies the impact on the reliability of the GB gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> given uncertainties such as wind variability, gas supply availability and outages to energy infrastructure assets. Analysis is performed over a typical midwinter week on a hypothesised GB gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> in 2020 that meets European renewable energy targets. The efficacy of doubling GB gas storage capacity on the reliability of the energy system is assessed. The results highlight the value of greater gas storage facilities in enhancing the reliability of the GB energy system given various energy uncertainties...|$|R

30|$|Extensive {{research}} has been conducted on the coordinated planning and operation of the integrated <b>electricity</b> and gas <b>network.</b> A multi-objective optimization for combined gas and <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> expansion planning was presented in [9]. The objectives were to minimize both investment cost and production cost of the combined system while taking into account the N- 1 network security criterion. The coordinated scheduling of <b>electricity</b> and gas <b>network</b> was described as a bi-level programming formulation in [10]. The objective of the upper-level problem is to minimize the operating cost of <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> while the scheduling optimization problem of gas network is embedded within the lower-level problem. In [11], an interval optimization based operating strategy for gas-electricity integrated energy systems was proposed considering demand response and wind uncertainty. In most of the previous research, only the gas-fired generator has been considered as the linkage between the <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> and gas network. Reference [12] proposed the model of an integrated energy system (IES) with <b>electricity</b> <b>network,</b> gas network, and district heating and cooling units (DHCs) embedded, in which both the gas-fired generators and DHCs are regarded as the interconnections of the <b>electricity</b> <b>network</b> and gas network. Then a coordinate scheduling strategy was utilized to optimize conflicting benefits of the two networks. The simulation results verified that the coordinate scheduling strategy can obtain better solutions of the power generation cost and gas supply cost compared with the single objective optimization method.|$|R
