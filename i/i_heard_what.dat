In an interview with News.com.au, Guetta spoke about its leak, saying, [...] "You shouldn't even know about that...I'd rather not speak about it. That was annoying. It wasn't supposed to be out there." [...] Sia recorded a demo of the song, which was then sent to Blige and other artists. Eventually, Guetta decided {{to stay with her}} version.

2500|$|We {{have made}} our {{positions}} well known. Ghanaian societies frown on homosexuality ... if the people's interest {{is that we}} do not legalize homosexuality, I don't see how any responsible leader will decide to go against the wishes of his people. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>what</b> the secretary general said and I wasn't surprised because of where he is coming from, but we only listened to him. We have all made our positions well known. Nobody can say in Ghana we discriminate against homosexuality, there is no witch-hunting on homosexuality ... that is their own problem so we only listen and move on.
