40|$|AbstractIn {{the eastern}} Gulf of Mexico, {{off the coast}} of Florida, <b>grey</b> <b>snapper,</b> Lutjanus griseus was found to be {{infected}} with the myxozoan parasite Sphaerospora motemarini n. sp., with high prevalence (83 %) and intensity of infection occuring in age- 0 fish, and with parasite levels decreasing with age (age- 1 snapper 40 %; age- 2 snapper 0 %). The morphological, molecular and phylogenetic characterisation of the myxozoan showed that it {{is a member of the}} typically marine, polysporoplasmid Sphaerospora spp. which form a subclade within the Sphaerospora sensu stricto clade of myxozoans, which is characterised by large expansion segments in their SSU rDNA sequences. Presporogonic stages of S. motemarini n. sp. were detected in the blood, using PCR. Pseudoplasmodia and spores were found to develop in the renal corpuscles of the host, causing their massive expansion. Macroscopic and histopathological changes were observed in age- 0 fish and show that S. motemarini n. sp. causes severe glomerulonephritis in L. griseus leading to a compromised host condition, which makes it more susceptible to stress (catch-and-release, predators, water quality) and can result in mortalities. These results are discussed in relation to the exploitation of <b>grey</b> <b>snapper</b> populations by commercial and recreational fisheries and with the observed increased mortalities with temperature along the coast of Florida. In the future, we would like to determine prevalence and intensity of infection with S. motemarini n. sp. in juvenile L. griseus in different areas of the Gulf of Mexico in order to be able to estimate the temperature dependence of S. motemarini n. sp. proliferation and to be able to predict its distribution and severity during climatic changes in the Gulf...|$|E
40|$|The {{potential}} effects of pile driving on fish populations and commercial fisheries have received significant attention given {{the prevalence of}} pile driving occurring in coastal habitats throughout the world. Behavioral impacts of sound generated from these activities on fish typically have a greater area of influence than physical injury, and may therefore adversely affect a greater portion of the local population. This study used acoustic telemetry to assess the movement, residency, and survival of 15 sheepshead (Archosargus probatocephalus) and 10 <b>grey</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus griseus) in Port Canaveral, Florida, USA, in response to 35 days of pile driving at a wharf complex. No obvious signs of mortality or injury to tagged fish were evident from the data. Received sound pressure levels from pile strikes on {{the interior of the}} wharf, where reef fish primarily occur, were on average 152 - 157 dB re 1 μPa (peak). No significant decrease in sheepshead daytime residency was observed during pile driving within the central portion of the wharf and area of highest sound exposure, and no major indicators of displacement from the exposure wharf with the onset of pile driving were observed. There was evidence of potential displacement from the exposure wharf that coincided with the start of pile driving observed for 2 out of 4 <b>grey</b> <b>snapper,</b> along with a decrease in daytime residency for a subset of this species with high site fidelity prior to the event. Results indicate that snapper {{may be more likely to}} depart an area of pile driving disturbance more readily than sheepshead, but were less at risk for behavioral impact given the lower site fidelity of this species...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A new {{nematode}} species, Cucullanus pargi sp. n., {{is described}} from the intestine and pyloric caeca of the <b>grey</b> <b>snapper,</b> Lutjanus griseus (Linnaeus), off the southern Quintana Roo coast, Mexico. This species shows similar morphological features as cucullanids occurring in marine and brackish-water fishes; however, it differs {{from all other}} species in the length of spicules, ar-rangement and number of caudal papillae, position of the excretory pore and deirids. Cucullanus pargi is the third species of this genus described from fishes in Mexico and the second one from Mexican marine fishes. The genus Cucullanus Müller, 1777 is represented by an assemblage of species with a rather uniform morphol-ogy and many similarities (Moravec et al. 1993). The identification of species belonging to this genus is based particularly on the length {{and shape of the}} spicules, posi-tion of the excretory pore and deirids, and in the number and arrangement of caudal papillae. Petter (1974) pointed out that members of the genus Cucullanus are parasites of teleosts, amphibians and occasionally occur in turtles. The family Cucullanidae Cobbold, 1864 includes intestina...|$|E

40|$|Many {{ecological}} and recreationally important species of marine fishes use the mangrove ecosystem for foraging, protection, spawning {{and as a}} nursery habitat. This study examined the ontogenetic migration and trophic connectivity of reef fishes in Broward County, Florida to develop {{a better understanding of}} energy flow between the local mangrove and coral reef ecosystems. Four species of reef fishes – <b>grey</b> <b>snapper</b> Lutjanus griseus, bluestriped grunt Haemulon sciurus, yellowfin mojarra Gerres cinereus, and great barracuda Sphyraena barracuda– were collected both from mangrove sites located adjacent to Port Everglades and coral reef sites located nearby offshore of Port Everglades in Broward County. All species were analyzed using 13 C and 15 N ratios from muscle tissues and 18 O and 13 C ratios from otoliths to evaluate ontogenetic migrations, foraging, and occupation within the mangrove and reef sites. Preliminary d 18 O and d 13 C otolith data indicated mangroves to be more enriched than offshore reef habitats. Food sources found in the mangroves are expected to be more enriched in 13 C and 15 N due to more recycling of nutrients. This study will help clarify the relative importance of the various habitats essential for early life-history stages of reef fishes...|$|E
40|$|A <b>grey</b> <b>snapper</b> (Lutjanus griseus), a grouper (Serranidae) and a {{blackjack}} (Caranx lugubris) were {{implicated in}} three different ciguatera poisonings in Guadeloupe, French West Indies. A mouse bioassay indicated toxicity for each specimens: 0. 5 - 1, {{greater than or equal}} to 1 and > 1 M Ug g(- 1), respectively. After purification by gel filtration chromatography, the samples were analysed by high-performance liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The toxin profiles differ from one fish to another. C-CTX- 1 was detected at 0. 24, 0. 90 and 13. 8 ng g(- 1) flesh in the snapper, grouper and jack, respectively. It contributed only to part of the whole toxicity determined by the mouse bioassay. Other toxins identified were C-CTX- 2 (a C-CTX- 1 epimer), three additional isomers of C-CTX- 1 or - 2, and five ciguatoxin congeners (C-CTX- 1127, C-CTX- 1143 and its isomer C-CTX- 1143 a, and C-CTX- 1157 and its isomer C-CTX- 1157 b). Putative hydroxy-polyether-like compounds were also detected in the flesh of the grouper with [M+ + H](+) ions at m/z 851. 51, 857. 50, 875. 51, 875. 49 and 895. 54 Da. Some of these compounds have the same mass range as some known dinoflagellate toxins. In conclusion, this study confirms the usefulness of LC-MS analysis to determine the ciguatoxins levels and the toxin profile in fish flesh hazardous to humans...|$|E
40|$|The {{degree of}} {{selectivity}} exhibited by juvenile lemon sharks towards a prey species {{was determined by}} presenting individual sharks with differing relative abundances of two prey species and recording the prey choice. Determining the selectivity of an organism is essential for understanding the interactions between a predator and its prey. The majority of studies on elasmobranch diet have reported the prey items found in the stomach {{of a number of}} sharks and have formulated predictions on the foraging strategy of the animal. However, the extent to which an elasmobranch specialises on one prey type has never been demonstrated. Similarly it is unclear whether sharks display periodicity when feeding or are asynchronous and consume prey at all times of the day or night. Using the semi natural conditions of pens constructed in a lagoon, individual sharks were exposed to differing relative abundances of two prey species. An electivity index (E*) and a chi squared goodness of fit test were used to elucidate the selectivity of the sharks. Further analysis enabled the sharks functional response curve towards the prey items to be determined and any size selection in prey items identified. Stomach contents of the sharks were analysed to identify the times that feeding took place. Results from the investigation demonstrated that at all abundances of prey items the sharks were highly species selective towards yellowfin mojarra (mean E* 0. 326) whilst displaying almost complete negative selection for <b>grey</b> <b>snapper</b> (mean E* - 0. 939). A type II functional response curve (r 2 = 0. 9121) supported evidence that sharks are specialist predators. No size selection of prey items was observed. Stomach content analysis indicated that sharks are asynchronous feeders; however a more precise method of determining the times of feeding events is necessary for strong conclusions to be made on this matter. The selectivity of sharks arises {{as a result of the}} behavioural and morphological characteristics of the prey species. Mojarras probably provide a higher net energy gain than snappers as they appear easier to perceive and catch. Bimini Biological Field Station, 'Shark Lab', Bimini, Bahama...|$|E
