(<b>strawberry</b> <b>tree)</b> has a circum-Mediterranean distribution, {{being found}} in western, central and {{southern}} Europe, north-eastern Africa (excluding Egypt and Libya) and the Canary Islands and western Asia. Fruits of the <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> are generally used for preparing alcoholic drinks (wines, liqueurs and brandies), jams, jellies and marmalades, and less frequently eaten as fresh fruit, despite their pleasing appearance. An overview of the chemical composition of {{different parts of the}} plant, <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> honey and <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> brandy will be presented.

40|$|The {{amounts of}} four well-recognized markers of the floral origin of <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> honey (i. e., 2, 5 -dihydroxyphenylacetic acid, homogentisic acid; (±) - 2 -cis, 4 -trans-abscisic acid, c,t-ABA; (±) - 2 -trans, 4 -trans-abscisic acid, t,t-ABA, and 2 -(1, 2 -dihydroxypropyl) - 4, 8, 8 -trimethyl- 1 -oxaspiro[2. 5]oct- 4 -en- 6 -one, unedone) were {{measured}} in the nectar of the <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> throughout the flowering periods of two years and at various sampling sites. The concentration of these compounds was also measured in reference to <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> honey samples from the same geographical origin {{in order to establish}} correlations and verify the possibility that one (or more) of them may act as marker(s) of the purity level, i. e., of the amount of nectar by <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> flowers that has been transferred to the relevant honey. The data obtained show that despite the existence of a good correlation level between the markers, none of them at the moment can be proposed as a marker of purity of this honey, due to very complex interactions between contamination by foreign nectars in <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> honey and spatial (geographical origin of the samples) and temporal (year and flowering period) parameters. Among these compounds, homogentisic acid appears to be the most reliable marker of botanical origin of <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> honey due to its higher concentration with respect to those measured for isomers of abscisic acid and unedon...|$|R

40|$|Three Mediterranean shrubs, Phillyrea latifolia L. (phillyrea), Arbutus unedo L. (<b>strawberry</b> <b>tree),</b> and Laurus nobilis L. (laurel), differing {{in their}} {{morphological}} and ecological response to water shortage, were exposed for 90 days to 0 or 110 ppb of ozone (O 3), 5 h each day. This yielded an accumulated exposure over of a threshold of 40 ppb (AOT 40) of 31. 5 ppm h over the 3 months experiment. These species showed differing responses to O 3 : laurel and phillyrea developed foliar chlorotic mottles on the adaxial surface of leaves, whereas <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> leaves showed reddish interveinal stipple-like necrotic lesions. In all cases, however, foliar injury did not exceed 8 % of the sampled leaf area. At {{the end of}} the exposure period, O 3 -induced stomatal limitation caused significant decreases of net photosynthesis in <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> and laurel, but not in phillyrea. The relative water content of the leaves was significantly decreased by O 3, especially in laurel and <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree,</b> suggesting the occurrence of drought stress. Electrical conductivity of leachates from foliar discs increased in response to the treatment, much more strongly in laurel and in <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> than in phillyrea, suggesting an O 3 -dependent alteration of the membrane retention capacity. At {{the end of the}} experimental period, the activity of superoxide dismutase and the content of reduced glutathione, but not that of reduced ascorbate, were significantly increased in the ozonated leaves of <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> and phillyrea, but not in laurel. The evergreen broadleaves studied here maybe relatively tolerant to realistic O 3 levels, {{at least in terms of}} visible injury and gas exchange. Such tolerance might overlap with their level of tolerance to drought stress. High constitutive levels, and/or O 3 -induced increases in antioxidants, might contribute to O 3 tolerance in these Mediterranean evergreen broadleaf species...|$|R

40|$|Mediterranean species, {{widespread}} throughout Sardinia. The main aim was {{to compare}} the past distribution of place names, referring to the <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree,</b> to the current distribution of the species on the island. In addition, we investigated the meaning and the diversity of these local place names in the various communities. The result was a collection of 432 phyto-toponyms. 248 of them were used for an analysis of their distribution in the habitats, indicated on the Map of the Nature System in Sardinia, defined {{on the basis of}} the current vegetation typology. The persistence of the species in the various habitats was either confirmed or negated with in site investigations and interviews. 47. 5 % of municipalities have place names related to the <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree.</b> Of the 248 phyto-toponyms, 127 fall in the habitats where the species currently persists proving a correspondence between their regional distribution and the current distribution of the species. The remaining 121 phyto-toponyms fall in habitats where the <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> is currently absent. Most of them are found in man-made habitats where man has transformed the forest cover which previously included the <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree.</b> This study also contributes to promoting and conserving the linguistic heritage of local communities...|$|R
40|$|Some of {{the major}} {{constituents}} of <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> are flavonoids and phenolic acids {{that are responsible for}} some of the pharmacological activities i. e. adstringent, antihypertensive, antidiarrheal and antibacterial.

Antioxidant activity of <b>strawberry</b> <b>tree</b> leaves varied between 11 % and 28 %.
