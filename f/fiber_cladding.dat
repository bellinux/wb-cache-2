50|$|These {{revolutions}} {{function as}} would a fiber Bragg grating. The density of twists per inch, or periodicity, demonstrably {{results in the}} light being coupled to the <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding,</b> scattered out of the fiber, or reflected back within the fiber. This interaction with light can be harnessed to produce sensors, polarizers/isolators, and filter/lasers, respectively.|$|E
40|$|Piezoelectric fibers with {{internal}} electrodes were fabricated by the co-extrusion process. The initial feedrods, which were com-posed of an outer piezoelectric PZN–PZT layer, a thin con-ducting PZN–PZT/Ag layer inside, and fugitive carbon black at the center, were co-extruded through a reduction die (1 mm) {{to form a}} continuous fiber. After thermal treatment and sinte-ring, the PZN–PZT/Ag layer became the inner electrode, while the carbon black at the center was removed by oxidation to form an empty space. Three different types of fibers were produced: (i) solid fiber filled with an inner electrode, (ii) hollow <b>fiber</b> <b>clad</b> with a uniform inner electrode, and (iii) hollow <b>fiber</b> <b>clad</b> with a partial inner electrode. The piezoelectric properties of the fibers were evaluated {{in terms of their}} longitudinal strain (s 31) or transverse displacement. When the dimensions of the fiber were 840 lm (outer diameter) 420 lm (inner diameter) 40 mm (length), the longitudinal strains of the solid fiber with the inner electrode and hollow <b>fiber</b> <b>clad</b> with the uniform inner electrode were 5. 25 105 and 8. 5 105 m/m, respectively, under an applied voltage of 100 V (0. 48 kV/mm) at a frequency of 100 Hz. For the hollow <b>fiber</b> <b>clad</b> with a partial inner electrode with the same dimensions, the transverse displacement was 80 lm under the same applied electric field. I...|$|R
50|$|A quadruply <b>clad</b> <b>fiber</b> has the {{advantage}} of very low macrobending losses. It also has two zero-dispersion points, and moderately low dispersion over a wider wavelength range than a singly <b>clad</b> <b>fiber</b> or a doubly <b>clad</b> <b>fiber.</b>|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{principle}} and features of laser cladding technology was described, and the fiber laser equipment was introduced. Coat an alloy wear-resistant layer on the failure surface of mine hydraulic prop, motor rotor, shovel drum and other shaft-parts by using <b>fiber</b> laser <b>cladding</b> technology, and take mine hydraulic prop {{as an example}} to introduce {{the steps of the}} <b>fiber</b> laser <b>cladding.</b> The results show that the <b>fiber</b> laser <b>cladding</b> repair technology can significantly improve the quality, hardness, wear resistance, service life of shaft-parts surface...|$|R
50|$|Beside {{mechanical}} destruction, {{another reason}} why one should avoid excessive bending of fiber-optic cables is to minimize microbending and macrobending losses. Microbending causes light attenuation induced by deformation of the fiber while macrobending causes the leakage of light through the <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding</b> and this {{is more likely to}} happen where the fiber is excessively bent.|$|E
40|$|An {{asymmetric}} polarization-maintaining {{single mode}} filter with one side-hole being {{incorporated into the}} <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding</b> has been investigated analytically in this work for potential pressure measurements. The material birefringence of the fiber is calculated using a thermo-elastic displacement potential method through the superposotion of sectional displacement potentials. The results obtained are generic and are thus applicable to any one-hole fiber structures, should the hole diameter or position vary in the <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding,</b> or the fiber hole be empty or filled in with any material. This enables the analysis to be applied more widely {{in a range of}} optical fiber senor applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{so-called}} side-exposure {{method has}} been widely used in the fabrication of fiber Bragg gratings (FBGs). The effects of the <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding</b> on the wavefronts of the UV writing beams and the interference fringes formed inside the fiber have been addressed in this study. The wavefronts of the UV beams have been analyzed {{and it has been}} demonstrated that the existence of the <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding</b> significantly alters the wavefronts of the UV beams in one plane and makes them highly astigmatic. Based on the calculated wavefront radii of the UV beams, a model has been established for prediction of the interference fringe pattern formed in the fiber core area...|$|E
50|$|In optical <b>fibers,</b> <b>cladding</b> is {{one or more}} {{layers of}} {{materials}} of lower refractive index, in intimate contact with a core material of higher refractive index. Cladding causes light to be confined {{to the core of}} the fiber by total internal reflection at the boundary between the two. Light propagation in the cladding is suppressed in typical fiber. Some <b>fibers</b> can support <b>cladding</b> modes in which light propagates in the cladding as well as the core.|$|R

5000|$|<b>Fiber</b> cement <b>cladding</b> is a {{very heavy}} product and {{requires}} two people to carry the uncut sheets. Thin <b>fiber</b> cement <b>cladding</b> is fragile before installation and must be handled carefully; it is prone to chipping and breakage if improperly handled.

40|$|A {{photonic}} crystal fiber (PCF) with circular air {{holes in the}} <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding</b> and elliptical air holes in the fiber core is proposed. According to calculation, both ultrahigh birefringence (larger than 0. 01) and ultralow confinement loss (less than 0. 001 dB/km) can be achieved simultaneously over a large wavelength range for a PCF with only four rings of circular air holes in the <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding.</b> The confinement loss in this PCF can be effectively reduced while the birefringence almost remains the same. The proposed design of the PCF is {{a solution to the}} tradeoff between the birefringence and the confinement loss for the originally reported highly birefringent elliptical-hole PCF. Moreover, an approach to modify the effective index of fiber core is also suggested in this letter...|$|E

The cooling process {{takes place in the}} Yb 3 +:ZBLAN <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding.</b> It is shown that for each value of the pump power and the amplified signal there is a distribution of the concentration of the Tm 3 + {{along the length of the}} fiber amplifier, which provides its athermal operation. The influence of a small deviation in the value of the amplified signal on the temperature of the fiber with the fixed distribution of the Tm 3 +ions in the <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding</b> is investigated.

40|$|Long-period {{fiber grating}} (LPG) sensors {{have been widely}} used as {{refractive}} index sensors due to their high sensitivity to the ambient refractive index change surrounding the <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding</b> of the LPG. Application of the LPG refractive index sensor has been found in chemical sensing and biochemical sensing, however for application of label-free dip and measure biosensors based on receptor immobilized LPG bio-sensor, the conventional fiber optic refractive index sensors are limited in the refractive index sensitivity, resolution, and operational range owing to the low sensitivity of the cladding mode effective index dependence on the ambient refractive index and the broad-spectrum feature of the LPG transmission spectrum. Low-cost, disposable fiber optic biochemical sensors with improved sensitivity, stability and resolution are needed to provide a high-sensitivity platform for immunology and DNA/aptamer biosensor. In this work, a novel fiber optic biosensing platform based on the LPG and the LPG in-fiber Michelson interferometer is designed and fabricated. The sensitivity and operation range enhancement is optimized by modifying the <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding</b> structur...|$|E

40|$|Development of practical, {{high-temperature}} optical claddings {{for improved}} waveguiding in sapphire fibers continued during the reporting period. A set of designed experiments using the Taguchi method was undertaken to efficiently determine the optimal set of processing variables to yield <b>clad</b> <b>fibers</b> with good optical and mechanical properties. Eighteen samples of sapphire fibers were prepared with spinel claddings, {{each with a}} unique set of variables. Statistical analyses of the results were then used to predict the set of factors that would result in a spinel cladding with the optimal geometrical, mechanical, and optical properties. To confirm the predictions of the Taguchi analysis, sapphire <b>fibers</b> were <b>clad</b> with the magnesium aluminate spinel coating using the predicted optimal set of factors. In general, the <b>clad</b> <b>fibers</b> demonstrated high quality, exceeding the best results obtained during the Phase I effort. Tests of the high-temperature stability of the <b>clad</b> <b>fibers</b> were also conducted. The results indicated that the <b>clad</b> <b>fibers</b> were stable at temperatures up to 1300 C {{for the duration of the}} three day test. At the higher temperatures, some changes in the geometry of the fibers were observed. The design, fabrication, and testing of a sapphire sensor for measurement of temperature was undertaken. The specific sensor configuration uses a polished sapphire wafer as the temperature-sensitive element. The wafer is attached to a sapphire <b>fiber</b> (<b>clad</b> or unclad), and interrogated as a Fabry-Perot sensor. Methods for assembling the sensor were investigated. A prototype sensor was fabricated and tested at room temperature and elevated temperatures. Results were difficult to interpret, due to the presence of modal noise which was found to result from the use of a spectrometer that was not designed for use with multimode fibers. A spectrometer optimized for use of multimode fiber has been obtained, and further evaluation of the sapphire temperature sensor is continuing...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We numerically {{compare the}} mode {{birefringence}} and confinement loss with four patterns (case A–D) of index-guiding photonic crystal fibers (PCF) using the finite element method. These PCFs {{are composed of}} a solid silica core surrounded by different sizes of elliptical air holes and a cladding which consist of the same elliptical air holes in <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding</b> with tetragonal lattice. The maximal modal birefringence and lowest confinement loss of our proposed case A structure at the excitation wavelength of λ = 1550 nm can be achieved at a magnitude of 5. 3 × 10 − 2 (which is the highest value to our knowledge) and less than 0. 051 dB/km (an acceptable value less than 0. 1 dB/km) with only four rings of air holes in <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding,</b> respectively. The merit of our designed PCFs is that the birefringence and confinement loss can be easily controlled by turning the pitch (hole to hole spacing) of elliptical air holes in PCF cladding...|$|E
40|$|Theoretical {{analysis}} was conducted with the purpose for further development of spectral-sensitive elements for fiber optic devices including sensors of physical magnitudes. Forecasting performances of such elements is conducted. Analysis has shown that coupling coefficient between propagating modes (incident and reflected) of <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding</b> grating is sufficient for sensitive elements manufacturing because on <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding</b> {{it is possible to}} achieve significant equivalent periodic modification of refraction index not taking into consideration that wave amplitude in the cladding is significantly less than in the core. Such gratings can be created by holographic method using photopolymeric media and lasers working in blue-green area of spectrum. The case of the corrugated or sinusoidal boundary between fiber core and cladding is also possible, and between cladding and external medium under investigation, for example with water, where various substances are dissolved, influencing on refraction and absorption of light waves propagating in the fiber. The results of theoretical researches can be used for developing devices with periodic structures on optical fibers...|$|E

OTDR measurements allow locating and detecting chemicals by measuring the time delay between short light pulses entering the fiber and discrete changes in the backscatter signals that are caused by local extraction of hydrocarbons into the <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding.</b> The light guiding properties of the fiber are affected by interaction of the extracted chemicals with the evanescent wave light field extending into the <b>fiber</b> <b>cladding.</b> Distributed sensing of pure liquid hydrocarbons (HC) and aqueous HC solutions with a commercially available mini-OTDR adapted to sensing fibers of up to one kilometer length could be demonstrated. A pulsed laser diode emitting at the 850 -nm telecommunication wavelength was applied in the mini-OTDR to locate the HCs by analyzing the step drop (light loss) in the backscatter signal, which is induced by refractive index changes in the silicone cladding due to analyte enrichment.
