A known way of improving the strength, ductility and formability of steels is to make use of additional strengthening and deformation mechanisms by introducing supplementary phases.

40|$|<b>High</b> <b>strength</b> <b>multiphase</b> CMnSi <b>steel</b> is {{increasingly}} used in passenger cars. Si and Mn alloying levels are typically {{in the range}} of 1 - 2 % in mass. While Si improves the mechanical properties, it considerably deteriorates the galvanisability of steel. Residual water vapour in the reducing gas atmosphere during the intercritical or austenitic annealing results in the selective oxidation of Si and Mn at the steel surface. Besides Mn and Si, C is oxidized as well at the steel surface, leading to the formation of CO gas and decarburisation of the steel surface. This decarburisation has a major influence on the phase composition in the steel surface region: it shifts the ferrite to austenite transformation to higher annealing temperatures, leading to differences in surface and bulk microstructure. The phase composition influences the solubility and diffusivity of all alloying elements near the surface. The evolution with temperature of the selective oxidation at the steel surface has been studied by interrupted annealing in a protective atmosphere containing residual water vapour. The influence of the annealing temperature on the selective oxidation of Mn and Si is characterized by XPS (X-ray Photo-electron Spectroscopy) analysis...|$|R

40|$|TRansformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) {{is a very}} {{effective}} mechanism to increase the strain hardening capacity of <b>multiphase</b> <b>steels</b> containing a fraction of metastable austenite, leading to both <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> and large uniform elongation. Excellent performances have been reached in the past 20 years, with recent renewed interest {{through the development of}} the 3 rd generation of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> steels often involving a TRIP effect. The microstructure and composition optimization is complex due to the interplay of coupled effects on the transformation kinetics and work hardening such as phase stability, size of retained austenite grains, temperature and loading path. In particular, recent {{studies have shown that the}} TRIP effect can only be quantitatively captured for realistic microstructures if strain gradient plasticity effects are taken into account, although direct experimental validation of this claim is missing. Here, an original computational averaging scheme is developed for predicting the elastoplastic response of TRIP aided <b>multiphase</b> <b>steels</b> based on a strain gradient plasticity model. The microstructure is represented by an aggregate of many elementary unit cells involving each a fraction of retained austenite with a specified stability. The model parameters, involving the transformation kinetics, are identified based on experimental tensile tests performed at different temperatures. The model is further assessed towards original experiments, involving temperature changes during deformation. A classical size independent plasticity model is shown unable to capture the TRIP effect on the mechanical response. Conversely, the strain gradient formulation properly predicts substantial variations of the strain hardening with deformation and temperature, hence of the uniform elongation in good agreement with the experiments. A parametric study is performed to get more insight on the effect of the material length scale as well as to determine optimum transformation kinetics to reach the highest possible strength-ductility balance.

40|$|The {{synchrotron}} X-ray {{radiation is}} a great tool in materials characterization with several advantageous features. The high intensity allows clear interaction signals and high energy of X-ray yields higher sampling volume. The samples do not need extra preparation and the microstructure is therefore not affected.

40|$|Previous {{use of the}} {{diffraction}} technique as a {{means of}} characterizing microstructure in <b>multiphase</b> <b>steels</b> has been generally limited to measurements of retained austenite.

This research looks at using neutron diffraction as a means to characterize martensite in a <b>multiphase</b> <b>steel</b> microstructure, thus providing a more complete characterization tool. Three low carbon steels, comprised of a dual-phase, ferrite-martensite microstructure, were used in this study. Two diffraction methods were investigated; a direct deconvolution of the martensite peaks from the ferrite peak, and an indirect determination of martensite volume fraction from ferrite peak broadening. Lastly, mechanical properties were investigated in order to determine if a correlation exists with ferrite peak broadening. The results indicate that the martensite phase has a prominent strain broadening effect in diffraction. The nature of this strain effect was hypothesized and a model was developed to confirm the findings.

40|$|The {{mechanical}} behaviour of transformation-induced plasticity (TRIP) -assisted <b>multiphase</b> <b>steels</b> is addressed based on three different microstructures {{generated from the}} same steel grade. The mechanisms responsible for the work-hardening capacity and the resulting balance between strength and resistance to plastic localization are investigated at different length scales. The macroscopic mechanical response is determined by simple shear, uniaxial tension, Marciniak and equibiaxial tension supplemented by earlier tensile tests on notched and cracked specimens. It is shown that the transformation rate reaches a maximum for stress states intermediate between uniaxial tension and equibiaxial tension. At an intermediate length scale, the true in situ flow properties of the individual ferrite bainite and retained austenite phases are determined by combining neutron diffraction and digital image correlation. This combined analysis elucidates the partitioning of stress and strain between the different constitutive phases. Based on these results, supplemented by transmission electron microscopy and electron backscattered diffraction observations, a general overview of the hardening behaviour of TRIP-assisted <b>multiphase</b> <b>steels</b> is depicted.

40|$|The {{microstructure}} of <b>multiphase</b> <b>steels</b> {{assisted by}} transformation-induced plasticity consists of grains of retained austenite {{embedded in a}} ferrite-based matrix. Upon mechanical loading, retained austenite may transform into martensite, {{as a result of}} which plastic deformations are induced in the surrounding phases, i. e., the ferrite-based matrix and the untransformed austenite. In the present work, a crystallographically based model is developed to describe the elastoplastic transformation process in the austenitic region. The model is formulated within a large-deformation framework where the transformation kinematics is connected to the crystallographic theory of martensitic transformations. The effective elastic stiffness accounts for anisotropy arising from crystallographic orientations as well as for dilation effects due to the transformation. The transformation model is coupled to a single-crystal plasticity model for a face-centered cubic lattice to quantify the plastic deformations in the untransformed austenite. The driving forces for transformation and plasticity are derived from thermodynamical principles and include lower-length-scale contributions from surface and defect energies associated to, respectively, habit planes and dislocations. In order to demonstrate the essential features of the model, simulations are carried out for austenitic single crystals subjected to basic loading modes.

The thermomechanical coupling is particularly relevant since in TRIP steels the phase transformation that occurs during mechanical loading is accompanied by the release of a considerable amount of energy (latent heat) that, in turn, affects the mechanical response of the material. The internal generation of heat associated with the martensitic phase transformation and the plastic deformation are modeled explicitly in the balance of energy. The momentum and energy equations are solved simultaneously by using a fully-implicit numerical scheme. The simulations are conducted using a micromechanical formulation for single crystals of austenite and ferrite. The characteristics of the model are illustrated by means of simulations for a single crystal of austenite and an aggregate of austenitic and ferritic grains.

In the case of the medium-carbon steel, this effect can be attributed to a much larger TRIP effect taking place during straining.

40|$|For {{ecological}} reasons, {{the current}} main {{challenge of the}} automotive industry {{is to reduce the}} fuel consumption of vehicles and then emissions of greenhouse gas. In this context, steelmakers and automotive manufacturers decided for some years now to join their efforts to promote the development and use of advanced <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> steels such as TRIP steels. A combination of <b>high</b> <b>strength</b> and large elongation is obtained thanks to the TRansformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) effect. However, improvement of the mechanical properties is still possible, especially by the refinement of the matrix. In this work, two main ways were followed in order to reach improved properties. The classical way consisting of the annealing of cold-rolled samples and an innovative way consisting of obtaining the desired microstructure by direct hot rolling of the samples. In the classical way, this refinement can be obtained by acting on the chemical composition (with such alloying elements like Cu and Nb). It was observed that complete recrystallisation of the ferrite matrix is quite impossible in presence of Cu precipitates. In addition, if the ferrite recrystallisation is not completed before reaching the eutectoid temperature, the recrystallisation will be slowed down by a large way. An innovative heat treatment consisting in keeping the copper in solid solution in the high-Cu steel was developed. Therefore, ferrite recrystallises quite easily and very fine ferrite grains (~ 1 µm) were obtained. In the innovative way, the effects of hot-rolling conditions on TRIP-assisted <b>multiphase</b> <b>steels</b> are of major importance for industrial practice and could open new dimensions for the TRIP steels (i. e. thanks to precipitation mechanisms leading to additive strengthening). Impressive mechanical properties (true stress at maximum load of 1500 MPa and true strain at uniform elongation of 0. 22) were obtained with a relatively easy thermomechanical process, the role played by Nb being essential.
