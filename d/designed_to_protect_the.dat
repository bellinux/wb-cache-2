5|$|The Corporation of Doncaster sought {{powers in}} 1727 {{to improve the}} river below Holmstile, as far as Wilsick House in Barnby Dun. The Bill passed through {{parliament}} uneventfully, and again included detailed restrictions on what could {{and could not be}} done, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> landowners. The details were very specific in that they included the permissible heights of dams, the maximum length of cuts, and many other details of the work to be carried out.|$|E
5|$|The pre-273 {{walls were}} narrow and while {{encircling}} the whole city, {{they do not}} seem to have provided real protection against an invasion. No signs of towers or fortified gates exist and it cannot be proven that the walls enclosed the city as many gaps appears to have never been defended. The earlier walls seem to have been <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> city against Bedouins and to provide a costume barrier.|$|E

The Constitution does not require Parliament to show that is necessary or expedient to restrict free speech in the interest of these grounds.|$|E

50|$|Nicknamed the Badger, The ILAV {{is based}} on the Cougar, which can carry ten {{passengers}} (the six wheel version can carry sixteen). The Cougar/ILAV vehicle uses a capsule <b>design</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> passengers and key vehicle components from mines and roadside bombs. The Badger itself costs about US$432,000. Just like other MRAPS, the Badger can be outfitted with a robotic arm for the purpose of investigating possible IEDS and UXOs.|$|R

5|$|The castle's fourth corner forms its {{gatehouse}}. Here {{the classic}} Edwardian gatehouse design {{has been transformed}} into an asymmetrical structure, with one tower much larger than the other. The gatehouse included portcullises, murder-holes and a drawbridge. Beyond the gatehouse lies a large barbican, inspired by a similar design of the period at the Tower of London and possibly built by the same workmen, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> causeway leading to the gatehouse. The barbican today is only half of its original height, and includes its own gate, designed to trap intruders within the inner defences. The gatehouse and barbican are linked by a stone causeway.|$|E
5|$|The {{rectangular}} west {{tower was}} a relatively short defensive structure, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> more vulnerable western slope of the ridge. A similar tower in the south overlooks {{the entrance to the}} castle. At {{the north end of the}} castle is the hall, stretching across the courtyard; in the east corner is an additional building, probably built by the English at the end of the 13th century. Although the hall is relatively large, 50 by 27feet (15 by 8m), these buildings follow a simpler design to those current in England at the time, where a combination of a hall, chamber and a service block in castles was becoming more common.|$|E
5|$|While {{assigned}} to the nuclear delivery role, the Victor was finished in an all-over anti-flash white colour scheme, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> aircraft against the damaging effects of a nuclear detonation. The white colour scheme was intended to reflect heat away from the aircraft; paler variations of RAF's roundels were also applied for this same reason. When the V-bombers were {{assigned to}} the low-level approach profile in the 1960s, the Victors were soon repainted in green/grey tactical camouflage to reduce visibility to ground observation; the same scheme was applied to subsequently converted tanker aircraft.|$|E

5|$|Calshot Castle was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> Solent, a body {{of water}} that led from the English Channel to the naval base at Portsmouth and, through Southampton Water, to the {{important}} port of Southampton. The castle was one of four forts that William Fitzwilliam, the Lord Admiral, and William Paulet decided to build to improve the defences along the Solent; the others were at East and West Cowes, and Hurst. Calshot was constructed on the narrow Calshot Spit, overlooking the deep-water channel running through into Southampton. Temporary earthwork defences and gun batteries were erected as an interim measure, but the castle itself was built quickly and finished by the end of 1540. It probably reused stone and lead from Bealieu and Netley abbeys, which had recently been closed during the Dissolution of the Monasteries.|$|E
5|$|Democracy {{essentially}} means {{rule of the}} people. To build {{a democratic}} society and rule, there must be citizen participation by an informed electorate. The freedom to speak and express is thus crucial {{for the formation of}} public opinion on political questions, and is indispensable to the discovery and spread of political truth. In Singapore, the right to freedom of speech and expression is guaranteed to citizens by Article 14(1)(a) of the Constitution, though it is subject to many qualifications. Parliament may by law impose restrictions on the right as it considers necessary or expedient {{in the interest of the}} security of Singapore, friendly relations with other countries, public order or morality, and restrictions <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> privileges of Parliament or to provide against contempt of court, defamation or incitement to any offence.|$|E
5|$|The Adriatic Sea {{sits on the}} Apulian or Adriatic Microplate, which {{separated}} from the African Plate in the Mesozoic era. The plate's movement contributed {{to the formation of}} the surrounding mountain chains and Apennine tectonic uplift after its collision with the Eurasian plate. In the Late Oligocene, the Apennine Peninsula first formed, separating the Adriatic Basin {{from the rest of the}} Mediterranean. All types of sediment are found in the Adriatic, with the bulk of the material transported by the Po and other rivers on the western coast. The western coast is alluvial or terraced, while the eastern coast is highly indented with pronounced karstification. There are dozens of marine protected areas in the Adriatic, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> sea's karst habitats and biodiversity. The sea is abundant in flora and faunaâ€”more than 7,000 species are identified as native to the Adriatic, many of them endemic, rare and threatened ones.|$|E

5|$|The Great Hall at {{the centre}} of the north range is entered through a porch and screens passage, a feature common in houses of the period, <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> {{occupants}} from draughts. As the screens are now missing, they may have been free-standing like those at Rufford Old Hall. The porch is decorated with elaborate carvings. The Great Hall's roof is supported by arch-braced trusses, which are decorated with carved motifs including dragons. The floor, now flagged, would probably originally have been rush-covered earth, with a central hearth. The gabled bay window overlooking the courtyard was added in 1559. The original service wing {{to the west of the}} Great Hall, behind the screens passage, was rebuilt in 1546, and housed a kitchen, buttery and pantry. A hidden shaft was discovered during a 19th-century investigation of two secret rooms above the kitchen, connecting them to a tunnel leading to the moat, the entrance to which has since been filled in. The west range now houses the gift shop and restaurant.|$|E
5|$|The pilot {{operated}} the controls at the bows of the gondola, {{forward of the}} engine, while the engineer controlled the engine from his position at the stern. A 52-kilowatt (70hp) Panhard et Levassor four-cylinder engine running at 1,000rpm, mounted centrally in the gondola, drove two 2.6-metre (8.5ft) diameter, two-bladed steel propellers that were mounted on cantilever arms, one on each side, rotating at 1,000â€“1,200rpm in opposite directions to prevent torque forces from twisting the airship. The exhaust pipe, below {{the rear of the}} gondola, was covered with metal gauze and pointed downwards to minimise the fire risk. The fuel tank, with a capacity in excess of 280L (61.6gal), was housed below the gondola within a pyramid of steel tubing that was <b>designed</b> <b>to</b> <b>protect</b> <b>the</b> gondola and the propellers during landing.|$|E

The larger Cougar costs about $730,000 each, fully equipped. The Cougars have been very popular with American troops, and with Iraqis who have worked with them. 865 ILAVs were ordered by Iraq and 18 by Yemen.
