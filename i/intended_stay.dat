40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to examine the effect of {{settlement}} intentions on the structural, social, and cultural integration of recently arrived intra-EU migrants in the Netherlands. Hypotheses on differences in integration, both shortly after arrival and over time, are derived from the intergenerational immigrant integration model. Based on two waves from the New Immigrants to the Netherlands Survey, a multilevel growth model was estimated. Most differences were found with regard to the level of integration shortly after arrival. Migrants who intend to leave and those who <b>intend</b> to <b>stay</b> were found to differ most strongly from each other in terms of initial levels of structural, social, and cultural integration. Migrants who <b>intend</b> to <b>stay</b> had more contact with natives, were more proficient in Dutch, and consumed more host country media than migrants who intend to leave. On the other hand, migrants who intend to leave worked more hours per week than migrants who <b>intend</b> to <b>stay.</b> Differences over time were only found with regard to Dutch language proficiency. Migrants who <b>intend</b> to <b>stay</b> increased their proficiency stronger than migrant who intend to leave...|$|R

60|$|During this {{dialogue}} I {{had been thinking}} {{that it was a}} very strange thing for the owners of this place to visit their island in such a fashion. Why should they be in an open boat? And where did they come from? Wherever they might live, it was not at all probable that they would choose to be rowed from that point to this. From the general character and appointments of the house in which we had found a refuge, it was quite plain that its owners were people in good circumstances, who were in the habit of attending to their domestic affairs in a very orderly and proper way. It was to be presumed that it was their custom to come here in a suitable vessel, and to bring with them the stores needed during their <b>intended</b> <b>stay.</b> Now, there could be little or nothing in that boat, and, on the whole, I did not believe it contained the owners of this island.|$|E

Bobby and the elder of the two infants were stowed away safely in the back part of the carriage, where they allowed themselves to be placed without saying a word.
