25|$|The Constitution of Brazil {{provides}} that only willful crimes against life, namely full or attempted murder, abortion, infanticide and suicide instigation, {{be judged by}} juries.

25|$|Much {{like other}} war {{crimes of the}} era, the {{verdicts}} were handed down in verdicts of either <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> guilty. In all cases, except for Meyer-Gerhards, the accused received punishment. In many of the cases, the sentences were reduced from their previous issue.|$|E
25|$|The {{figure of}} Corriveau still inspires novels, songs and plays {{and is the}} subject of {{argument}} (was she <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not?).</b> Oral tradition also perpetuated and has not stopped, and remains alive, as is evidenced by the numerous stories collected in the lands of many regions of Quebec.|$|E

25|$|The {{trial began}} with Nilsen being {{asked by the}} chief {{administrator}} of the court whether he entered a plea of <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> guilty in relation to each charge. In response to each charge, Nilsen entered a plea of not guilty. Upon completion of his pleas, the jury was sworn into the courtroom.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} issues {{as to the}} {{capacity}} of Bonjon for the jury to consider: firstly, whether Bonjon {{had the capacity to}} enter a plea to the jurisdiction; and secondly, whether Bonjon had the capacity to enter a plea to the general issue, that is, a plea of <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> guilty.|$|E
25|$|Twelve jurors decide by a {{qualified}} majority of two-thirds whether {{the defendant is}} <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> A tied vote results in 'not guilty'; a '7 guilty - 5 not guilty' vote is transferred to the 3 professional judges who can, by unanimity, reverse the majority to 'not guilty'. The sentence is delivered by a majority of the 12 jurors and the 3 professional judges. As a result of the Taxquet ruling the juries give nowadays the most important motives that lead them to their verdict. The procedural codification has been altered to meet the demands formulated by the European Court of Human Rights.|$|E

These defendants were tried for alleged crimes of fashion, trend misdemeanors and other style infractions. The judge hears the evidence, consults the jury, and hands down a verdict of <b>guilty</b> (makeover) <b>or</b> <b>not</b> <b>guilty</b> (no makeover).

25|$|The {{proceeding}} in the inquisitorial {{system is}} essentially by writing. Most {{of the witnesses}} would have given evidence in the investigation phase and such evidence will be contained in the dossier under the form of police reports. In the same way, the accused would have already put his or her case at the investigation phase but {{he or she will}} be free to change her or his evidence at trial. Whether the accused pleads <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> a trial will be conducted. Unlike the adversarial system, the conviction and sentence to be served (if any) will be released by the trial jury together {{with the president of the}} trial bench, following their common deliberation.|$|E
25|$|At the Dachau Trials, {{the issue}} of whether the donning of enemy uniforms to {{approach}} the enemy without drawing fire was within the laws of war was established under international humanitarian law at the trial in 1947 of the planner and commander of Operation Greif, Otto Skorzeny. Skorzeny was found not guilty by an American military tribunal of a crime by ordering his men into action in American uniforms. He had passed on to his men the warning of German legal experts, that if they fought in American uniforms, they would be breaking the laws of war, but they probably were not doing so just by wearing American uniforms. During the trial, a number of arguments were advanced to substantiate this position and that the German and U.S. military seem to be in agreement on it. In its judgement, the tribunal noted that the case did not require that the tribunal make findings other than those of <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> guilty, so consequently, no safe conclusion could be drawn from the acquittal of all accused.|$|E
500|$|The Crown Prosecutor for Hampshire & Isle of Wight stated [...] "the {{evidence}} {{would have}} been sufficient to prosecute David Lace, if he were alive, with the offences of the {{rape and murder of}} Teresa DeSimone. But this is in no sense a declaration that he was guilty of the offences. Had Mr Lace lived, our decision would merely have authorised the police to begin the legal process by charging him. Only after trial does a jury decide whether a person is <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> on a higher standard of proof – beyond reasonable doubt." ...|$|E

500|$|Most notably, Weizsäcker {{spoke of}} the danger of forgetting and {{distorting}} the past. [...] "There {{is no such thing as}} the guilt or innocence of an entire nation. Guilt is, like innocence, not collective but personal. There is discovered or concealed individual guilt. There is guilt which people acknowledge or deny. [...] All of us, whether <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> whether young or old, must accept the past. We are all affected by the consequences and liable for it. [...] We Germans must look truth straight in the eye – without embellishment and without distortion. [...] There can be no reconciliation without remembrance." ...|$|E
2500|$|Judge Willis however {{considered}} that Bonjon [...] "is not so totally wanting intellect {{as not to}} say <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> guilty", and thus decided that the case could proceed {{to the question of}} jurisdiction.|$|E
2500|$|The current Czech {{criminal}} {{legislation has}} implications both for decisions about guilt (affecting the decision whether {{to find a}} defendant <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> guilty) and decisions concerning sentencing (affecting {{the extent of the}} punishment imposed).

60|$|At {{that time}} {{some of the}} tribes in the {{neighbourhood}} of Bigbear Gully had committed numerous depredations at the diggings, and had murdered several white men, so that the latter had begun to regard the Red Men as their natural enemies. Indeed {{some of the more}} violent among them had vowed that they would treat them as vermin, and shoot down every native they chanced to meet, whether he belonged to the <b>guilty</b> tribe <b>or</b> <b>not.</b> The Indian who now approached the camp-fire of the white men knew that he had good ground to fear the nature of his reception, and {{there is no doubt that}} it would have been an unpleasant one had it not been for the fact that his appearance was pitiable in the extreme.|$|R
6000|$|Nothing {{more could}} be {{got out of}} him until the cab swept round the corner by the Hotel Saint Louis, where they got out, and he led the party up a side lane already in deep shadow with the growing dusk. Once, when the Duke impatiently asked whether Hirsch was <b>guilty</b> of treason <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> he {{answered}} rather absently: [...] "No; only of ambition--like Caesar." [...] Then he somewhat inconsequently added: [...] "He lives a very lonely life; {{he has had to}} do everything for himself." ...|$|R
500|$|The accused was {{entitled}} to object to {{the composition of the}} panel (e.g. if one of the officers was connected with the case or enjoyed a poor relationship with the accused) and to present his case, defended by an officer (a [...] "Prisoner's Friend") if he chose, although [...] "Prisoners Friends" [...] became more common as the war went on. The officer who convened a court martial could not sit on it, and the most junior officer voted first (to lessen the chance of his deferring to a superior's opinion). However, the courts were explicitly intended to be [...] "speedy" [...] and were sometimes encouraged by higher authority to make an example of certain offences, and in practice the leniency of the court and the ability of the accused to defend himself varied widely. Some pleaded <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> chose <b>not</b> to present a defence or call witnesses, and in most cases the offence was [...] "so blatant that little defence could be put forward".|$|R
2500|$|The Austro-Hungarian Ambassador to Bucharest, Count Ottokar von Czernin, {{remained}} {{skeptical of}} all Romanian disclaimers, and, in his memoirs, alleged that, whether Cătărău was <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> [...] "the Romanian authorities certainly were". In fact, Grigoraș claims, Czernin himself buried the affair: Archduke Franz Ferdinand ordered his diplomat {{not to answer}} in kind to the warmongers. Grigoraș argues that, because of this disengagement, the Entente's hawks changed their tactic and organized the Sarajevo Assassination.|$|E
2500|$|In 1277, the Lord of North Powys died leaving {{two young}} sons. [...] Mortimer was {{appointed}} by King Edward Longshanks to be their guardian. [...] Four years later their bodies washed up in the River Dee, and Mortimer was accused of their murder.

2500|$|After this, Judge Willis put the {{question}} to the jury, who unanimously decided that Bonjon did not have the capacity to enter a plea to the jurisdiction. At Judge Willis' suggestion, and with the agreement of the parties, {{the question}} as to the general plea was put to the jury without recalling the witnesses: the jury decided that Bonjon had capacity to know whether he did or did not kill Yammowing, but not to plead <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> guilty, [...] "as murder is not always considered a crime with the Aborigines".|$|E
50|$|Initially, Governor Winslow {{did have}} a chance, while the {{fighting}} was still contained locally, to resolve the situation peacefully by diplomatic means, but did not take needed action and brought about a major conflagration that actually need not have happened. An example of Winslow's thinking, and about the first time slavery {{was used as a}} weapon against the Indians, was when several hundred Indians had surrendered to authorities in Plymouth and Dartmouth who had assured them of amnesty. But Winslow and his advisors on the Council of War refused to honor such assurance and the council decided, on August 4, that all surrendered Indians should be considered <b>guilty</b> whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> they {{had been part of the}} attack in which they were captured. Within several months, all captured Indians from Plymouth and Dartmouth had been shipped as slaves to the Spanish at Cadiz.|$|R
60|$|But {{that does}} not prevent its being a visitation of God; yea, in most awful and literal earnest, a house-to-house visitation. God uses the powers of nature to do His work: of Him it is written, 'He maketh the winds His angels, and flames of fire His ministers.' And so this minute and {{invisible}} cholera-seed is the minister of God, by which He is visiting from house to house, searching out and punishing certain persons who have been <b>guilty,</b> knowingly <b>or</b> <b>not,</b> of the offence of dirt; of filthy and careless habits of living; and especially, as {{has long been known}} by well-informed men, of drinking poisoned water. Their sickness, their deaths, are God's judgment on that act of theirs, whereby God says to men,--You shall not drink water unfit for even dumb animals; and if you do, you shall die.|$|R
2500|$|When Court TV confronted Grace {{seven months}} later to ask whether she was {{incorrect}} in her assertion that Ricci was <b>guilty,</b> and whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> she felt bad about it in any way, she stated that Ricci was [...] "a known ex-con, a known felon, and brought suspicion on himself, so who could blame anyone for claiming he was the perpetrator?" [...] When Larry King asked her about the matter, she equated criticism of herself with criticism of the police in the case. She said: [...] "I'm not letting you take the police with me on a guilt trip." ...|$|R
2500|$|A jury is a sworn body {{of people}} convened to render an {{impartial}} verdict (a {{finding of fact}} on a question) officially submitted to them by a court, or to set a penalty or judgment. Modern juries tend {{to be found in}} courts to ascertain the guilt, or lack thereof, in a crime. [...] In Anglophone jurisdictions, the verdict may be <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> guilty (not proven; a verdict of acquittal, based on the state's failure to prove guilt rather than any proof of innocence, is also available in Scotland). The old institution of grand juries still exists in some places, particularly the United States, to investigate whether enough evidence of a crime exists to bring someone to trial.|$|E
2500|$|Tuckfield was {{the next}} witness called, and he testified that Bonjon [...] "entertains some ideas of a Supreme Being", but that his ideas were [...] "very {{imperfect}} and indistinct notions, not sufficient for him {{to understand the nature}} and obligations of an oath." [...] Justice Willis explained to Tuckfield the nature of a plea to the jurisdiction, after which Tuckfield added that he did not think Bonjon could enter such a plea, although he was satisfied Bonjon could plead <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> guilty. On cross-examination by Croke, Tuckfield testified that [...] "urder is considered a crime amongst the Aboriginals, but under all circumstances I do not think they would consider it as such, there are some exceptions." ...|$|E
2500|$|Other {{areas where}} two values {{is a good}} choice are the law and mathematics. In {{everyday}} relaxed conversation, nuanced or complex answers such as [...] "maybe" [...] or [...] "only on the weekend" [...] are acceptable. In more focused situations such as a court of law or theorem-based mathematics however it is deemed advantageous to frame questions so as to admit a simple yes-or-no answer—is the defendant <b>guilty</b> <b>or</b> <b>not</b> guilty, is the proposition true or false—and to disallow any other answer. However much of a straitjacket this might prove in practice for the respondent, the principle of the simple yes-no question has become a central feature of both judicial and mathematical logic, making two-valued logic deserving of organization and study in its own right.|$|E

5000|$|Stevens was {{alleged to}} have {{committed}} an offence {{a few months before}} April 17, 1982, when the Charter came into effect. The offence was sexual intercourse by a male person with a female person under the age of fourteen years. The Criminal Code provision defining the offence specified that the accused is <b>guilty</b> [...] "whether <b>or</b> <b>not</b> he believes that she is fourteen years of age or more". Counsel for the accused argued that this part of the offence contravened section 7 of the Charter, by denying a mens rea aspect to an essential element of the offence. In essence, the argument parallels that made successfully in Re BC Motor Vehicle Act (1985).|$|R
