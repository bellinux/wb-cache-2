The next leading use is in polymers and ceramics in high-strength, lightweight structural and refractory materials. Borosilicate glass is desired for its greater strength and thermal shock resistance than ordinary soda lime glass. Boron compounds are used as fertilizers in agriculture and in sodium perborate bleaches. A small amount of boron {{is used as a}} dopant in semiconductors, and reagent intermediates in the synthesis of organic fine chemicals.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} Ph. D. {{research}} was to develop an empirical foundation suitable for designing educational interventions and programmes aiming to improve students’ learning. In order to achieve this, {{a series of studies}} was conducted that supported the development and test of a comprehensive, chained mediation model of academic performance. The proposed chained mediation model comprised of adaptive-positive and maladaptive-negative submodels. The adaptive-positive submodel hypothesised firstly that trait intrinsic motivation and adaptive metacognition would facilitate the use of creative cognition <b>in</b> <b>studying</b> (first-level mediator). Secondly, the model hypothesised that the use of creative cognition <b>in</b> <b>studying</b> would lead to the experience of positive affect <b>in</b> <b>studying,</b> and {{to the development of a}}daptive approaches to studying (second-level mediators). Finally, the submodel hypothesised that positive affect <b>in</b> <b>studying</b> and adaptive approaches to studying would facilitate academic performance. The maladaptive-negative submodel hypothesised firstly that trait extrinsic motivation and maladaptive metacognition would lead to evaluation anxiety (first-level mediator). Secondly, the model hypothesised that evaluation anxiety would lead to the experience of negative affect <b>in</b> <b>studying,</b> and to the development of a maladaptive approach to studying (second-level mediators). Finally, the submodel hypothesised that negative affect <b>in</b> <b>studying</b> and the maladaptive approach to studying would undermine academic performance. A total of five studies were conducted employing 2140 university students. Study 1 tested the effects of approaches to studying and positive and negative affect <b>in</b> <b>studying</b> on students’ academic performance. The results strongly indicated that positive and negative affect <b>in</b> <b>studying</b> explains students’ academic performance better than approaches to studying. Studies 2 and 3 developed and validated a new Use of Creative Cognition Scale (UCCS), which measures students’ tendency to deploy creative thinking strategies <b>in</b> <b>studying.</b> Study 4 tested longitudinal relationship between positive affect <b>in</b> <b>studying</b> and the use of creative cognition. The results supported the reciprocal, longitudinal relationship between the two constructs. Finally, Study 5 proposed and tested the comprehensive, chained mediation model of academic performance.

25|$|Distraction from sadness using {{art therapy}} {{may be a}} better {{alternative}} than venting sadness. Two studies by Drake and Winner (2012) published from the American Psychological Association compared venting (expressing negative feelings) and distraction (expressing something that is not related to negative feelings) in one study. To distract oneself, the participants were told to draw something unrelated to a sad film they had watched. The participants who had vented were told to draw something related to the film. <b>In</b> <b>study</b> 2, the participants were told to think of a sad event and were put into the venting, distraction, and calming position or sitting conditions. The sitting condition allowed the passage of time to be evaluated. <b>In</b> <b>study</b> 1, the distraction method in which the participants drew something unrelated to the sad film significantly improved negative mood compared to the venting condition. <b>In</b> <b>study</b> 2, the distraction method in which the participants drew a house (something unrelated to the sad event), had significantly improved negative mood compared to venting (drawing the sad event) or the sitting condition (sat quietly for 10 minutes). Therefore, art therapy could be beneficial to people suffering from depressive moods through a way of distraction rather than venting.|$|E

40|$|Research on students’ {{learning}} {{identified that}} positive affect {{is a strong}} predictor of better academic performance even when statistically controlling for effects of prior academic performance and approaches to learning (e. g., Rogaten, Moneta & Spada, 2013). A variable that {{has been found to}} strongly link with positive affect <b>in</b> <b>studying</b> is use of creative cognition, which is the habit to deploy one’s own creative ability to an endeavour (Rogaten & Moneta, in press). Based on the broaden-and-build theory (Fredrickson, 1998), the mood-as-input model (Martin et al., 1993), the control-process model (Carver & Scheier, 2001), and self-determination theory (Deci & Ryan, 1985), it was hypothesised that positive affect will be both an antecedent and a consequence of use of creative cognition <b>in</b> <b>studying.</b> 130 university students completed the International Positive and Negative Affect Schedule - Short Form (I-PANAS-SF) and the Use of Creative Cognition Scale (UCCS) with reference to their overall <b>studying</b> experience <b>in</b> the first and second semesters of an academic year. A comparison of alternative structural equation models showed clear support for the reciprocal relationship between positive affect <b>in</b> <b>studying</b> and use of creative cognition <b>in</b> <b>studying.</b> This is the first study that found the longitudinal relationship between use of creative cognition <b>in</b> <b>studying</b> and subsequent positive affect <b>in</b> <b>studying,</b> which opens novel possibilities for interventions.
