5|$|Unlike other <b>data</b> <b>buses</b> (e.g., Ethernet, HDMI), USB {{connections}} are directed, with both {{upstream and downstream}} ports emanating from a single host. This applies to electrical power, with only downstream facing ports providing power; this topology was chosen to easily prevent electrical overloads and damaged equipment. Thus, USB cables have different ends: A and B, with different physical connectors for each. Therefore, in general, each different format requires four different connectors: a plug and receptacle {{for each of the}} A and B ends. USB cables have the plugs, and the corresponding receptacles are on the computers or electronic devices. In common practice, the A end is usually the standard format, and the B side varies over standard, mini, and micro. The mini and micro formats also provide for USB On-The-Go with a hermaphroditic AB receptacle, which accepts either an A or a B plug. On-The-Go allows USB between peers without discarding the directed topology by choosing the host at connection time; it also allows one receptacle to perform double duty in space-constrained applications.|$|E

25|$|The Intel 80286 (also {{marketed as}} the iAPX 286 and often called Intel 286) is a 16-bit {{microprocessor}} that was introduced on 1 February 1982.

The 80286 used approximately 134,000 transistors in its original nMOS (HMOS) incarnation and, just like the contemporary 80186, it could correctly execute most software written for the earlier Intel 8086 and 8088 processors.|$|E

25|$|The Altair bus {{consists}} of the pins of the Intel 8080 run out onto the backplane. No particular level of thought went into the design, which led to such disasters as shorting from various power lines of differing voltages being located next to each other. Another oddity was that the system included two unidirectional 8-bit <b>data</b> <b>buses,</b> but only a single bidirectional 16-bit address bus. A deal on power supplies led {{to the use of}} +8V and +18V, which had to be locally regulated on the cards to TTL (+5V) or RS-232 (+12V) standard voltage levels.|$|E
25|$|The 80286 was {{designed}} for multi-user systems with multitasking applications, including communications (such as automated PBXs) and real-time process control. It had 134,000 transistors and consisted of four independent units: address unit, bus unit, instruction unit and execution unit, organized into a loosely coupled (buffered) pipeline {{just as in the}} 8086. The significantly increased performance over the 8086 was primarily due to the non-multiplexed address and <b>data</b> <b>buses,</b> more address-calculation hardware (most importantly, a dedicated adder) and a faster (more hardware-based) multiplier. It was produced in a 68-pin package, including PLCC (plastic leaded chip carrier), LCC (leadless chip carrier) and PGA (pin grid array) packages.|$|E

25|$|The P5 was {{followed}} by the P54C (80502), also known as Pentium-S; there were versions specified to operate at 75, 90, or 100MHz using a 3.3 volt power supply. This was the first Pentium processor to operate at 3.3 volts, reducing energy consumption. It employed an internal clock multiplier to let the internal circuitry work at a higher frequency than the external address and <b>data</b> <b>buses,</b> as it is more complicated and cumbersome to increase the external frequency, due to physical constraints. It also allowed two-way multiprocessing and had an integrated local APIC as well as new power management features. It contained 3.3 million transistors and measured 163mm2. It was fabricated in a BiCMOS process which has been described as both 0.5µm and 0.6 µm due to differing definitions.|$|E
25|$|Intel Corporation saw {{the massive}} {{potential}} of the invention and introduced the first commercial NOR type flash chip in 1988. NOR-based flash has long erase and write times, but provides full address and <b>data</b> <b>buses,</b> allowing random access to any memory location. This makes it a suitable replacement for older read-only memory (ROM) chips, which are used to store program code that rarely needs to be updated, such as a computer's BIOS or the firmware of set-top boxes. Its endurance may be from as little as 100 erase cycles for an on-chip flash memory, to a more typical 10,000 or 100,000 erase cycles, up to 1,000,000 erase cycles. NOR-based flash was the basis of early flash-based removable media; CompactFlash was originally based on it, though later cards moved to less expensive NANDflash.|$|E
25|$|The {{performance}} {{increase of}} the 80286 over the 8086 (or 8088) could be more than 100% per clock cycle in many programs (i.e. a doubled performance at the same clock speed). This was a large increase, fully comparable to the speed improvements around a decade later when the i486 (1989) or the original Pentium (1993) were introduced. This was {{partly due to the}} non-multiplexed address and <b>data</b> <b>buses,</b> but mainly to the fact that address calculations (such as base+index) were less expensive. They were performed by a dedicated unit in the 80286, while the older 8086 had to do effective address computation using its general ALU, consuming several extra clock cycles in many cases. Also, the 80286 was more efficient in the prefetch of instructions, buffering, execution of jumps, and in complex microcoded numerical operations such as MUL/DIV than its predecessor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} the methods {{employed in the}} Hoating-point area of the System/ 360 Model 91 to exploit the existence of multiple execution units.

The common data bus improves performance by efficiently utilizing the execution units without requiring specially optimized code. Instead, the hardware,. by &quot;looking ahead &quot; about eight instructions, automatically optimizes the program execution on a local basis.
