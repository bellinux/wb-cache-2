They recognize the girl-power undertow between the two of them." ...|$|E

[...] He told Bartley that he realized: [...] "I had to 'clean up' my life.

[...] For his efforts, Laich was hockey analyst Michael Farber's nominee for the 2010 Sports Illustrated Sportsman of the Year. When asked about the incident, Laich responded, [...] "It's not a big deal. It was just a tire.

Clemenson was apprehensive about pursuing one of the lead roles in a television show because of the long time commitments involved.

It {{was one of my}} favorite shows growing up, and as soon as <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> Brisco County was based on the same kind of material and attitude as that show, I called my agent and said, 'I'll do anything I {{have to do to get}} this. Clemenson applied his experiences at Ivy League schools to play the uptight Poole. Praising Clemenson's work on Brisco, Cuse said, [...] "You can't give him anything he's not capable of doing. He adds the voice of intelligence and caution to balance our cast".|$|E
500|$|After the duel {{between the}} two ironclads at Hampton Roads there was concern by some Navy {{officials}} who witnessed the battle that Monitors design might allow for easy boarding by the Confederates. In a letter dated 27 April 1862 Lieutenant Commander O.C. Badger wrote to Lieutenant H. A. Wise, Assistant Inspector of Ordnance, advising the use of [...] "liquid fire", scalding water from the boiler through hoses and pipes, sprayed out via the vents and pilothouse window, to repel enemy boarders. Wise who was aboard and inspected Monitor after the battle responded in a letter of 30 April 1862: [...] "With reference to the Monitor, the moment I jumped on board of her after the fight <b>I</b> <b>saw</b> <b>that</b> a steam tug with twenty men could have taken {{the upper part of}} her in as many seconds... I hear that hot water pipes are arranged so as to scald the assailants when they may dare to set foot on her." [...] The chance to employ such a tactic never arose. There are conflicting accounts as to whether such an anti-personnel provision was installed.|$|E

After that, the ala brought lunch and said to the woman, “Eat, kuma.” “How can I eat after I saw a poker and a broom fighting in the first room?” “Eat, kuma, eat. Those are my maids: they fight about which one should take the broom and sweep.” “How can I eat after I saw human arms and legs {{in the second and third}} rooms?” And the ala told her, “Eat, kuma, eat. That is my food.” “How can I eat, kuma, after I saw the sixth room full of blood?” “Eat, kuma, eat.
