25|$|Maternal passive {{immunity}} {{is a type}} of naturally acquired {{passive immunity}}, and refers to antibody-mediated immunity conveyed to a fetus or infant by its mother. Naturally acquired passive immunity can be provided during pregnancy, and through breastfeeding. In humans, maternal antibodies (MatAb) are passed through the placenta to the fetus by an FcRn receptor on placental cells. This occurs predominately during the third trimester of pregnancy, and thus is often reduced in babies born prematurely. Immunoglobulin G (IgG) is the only antibody isotype that can pass through the <b>human</b> <b>placenta,</b> and is the most common antibody of the five types of antibodies found in the body. IgG antibodies protects against bacterial and viral infections in fetuses. Immunization is often required shortly following birth to prevent diseases in newborns such as tuberculosis, hepatitis B, polio, and pertussis, however, maternal IgG can inhibit the induction of protective vaccine responses throughout the first year of life. This effect is usually overcome by secondary responses to booster immunization.|$|E

40|$|The aryl {{hydrocarbon}} receptor (AhR), a ligand-activated transcription factor, mediates many biological processes, including fetal development. In this study, we examined AhR protein expression in <b>human</b> <b>placentas</b> from normal (N) and severe preeclamptic (sPE) pregnancies, as well as human fetal tissues from the second trimester of pregnancy, using immunohistochemistry and/or Western blot analysis. In the placentas, the AhR immunoreactivity was present primarily in syncytiotrophoblasts. The AhR staining was also seen in endothelium of large blood vessels in villi and endothelium of umbilical cord arteries and veins. No difference in AhR protein levels was found between N and sPE placentas. In fetal tissues, the AhR immunoreactivity was localized in lung, kidney, esophagus, pancreas, liver, testicle, thymus gland, retina, and choroid, mainly in epithelial cells, whereas it was absent in heart, brain, sclera, and thoracic aorta. These {{findings suggest that the}} AhR plays a critical role in syncytiotrophoblasts of <b>human</b> <b>placentas</b> and epithelium of many fetal organs. These data also imply that <b>human</b> <b>placentas</b> and those fetal organs with high AhR expression (e. g., lung, kidney, liver, pancreas, and thymus gland) during fetal development are highly susceptible to environmental toxicants such as dioxin.

This was supported by immunofluorescence studies on cryostat sections of <b>human</b> <b>placentae</b> by using antibodies to placental and spleen ferritin. Specific staining for placental ferritin was demonstrated within placental syncytiotrophoblast, particularly localized towards the microvillus plasma membrane.

40|$|To better {{understand}} the molecular mechanisms involved in pathological development of placenta in preeclampsia, we used LC-MS/MS to construct a large-scale comparative proteome profile of <b>human</b> <b>placentas</b> from normal and preeclamptic pregnancies. A total of 2636 proteins were detected in <b>human</b> <b>placentas,</b> and 171 different proteins were definitively identified between control and preeclamptic placentas. Further bioinformatics analysis indicated that these differentially expressed proteins correlate with several specific cellular processes which occur during pathological changes of preeclamptic placenta. 6 proteins were randomly selected to verify their expression patterns with Western blotting. Of which, 3 proteins' cellular localizations were validated with immunohistochemistry.

40|$|Objective: To study re-association {{pattern of}} human placental eluate {{immunoglobulins}} with acid treated isologous and third party trophoblast derived placental microvesicles. Design: Laboratory based experimentation. Setting: Biological Sciences Department and Discipline for Reproductive Medicine University of Newcastle, Australia and the Department of Biochemistry, University of Nairobi, Kenya. Results: Placental eluate immunoglobulins re-associated with isologous and third party acidified microvesicles in three distinct patterns. I: eluate immunoglobulins re-associated more strongly with isologous and third party acid treated placental microvesicles, II: eluate immunoglobulins re-associated strongly with isologous but weakly with third party acid treated placental microvesicles, III: eluate immunoglobulins {{did not show}} preferential re-association with isologous and third party acid treated placental microvesicles.

40|$|The {{apoptosis}} cascade {{that plays}} {{a central role}} in normal and pathological processes is strictly controlled, in part by newly described members of the inhibitor of apoptosis (IAP) family (HIAP- 1, HIAP- 2, XIAP, NAIP, Survivin, and Livin). Here, we report the expression of IAP mRNAs and proteins in early and late gestation <b>human</b> <b>placentas,</b> term cytotrophoblast cells, and two choriocarcinoma cell lines, JEG- 3 and Jar. Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction identified mRNAs derived from all of the currently known IAP genes in all samples. Analysis by immunoblotting revealed that IAP proteins are present in early and late gestation <b>human</b> <b>placentas</b> and that levels of IAPs are not identical in normal and transformed trophoblast cells. Immunohistochemical experiments performed on paraformaldehyde-fixed tissue sections taken from early and late stages of pregnancy demonstrated that expression patterns differed according to cell lineage and stage of cell differentiation. The results of this study are consistent with the postulate that IAP proteins have critical roles in placental cell survival and suggest that specific apoptosis inhibitors may protect normal and transformed trophoblast cells from cell death...|$|R

40|$|The {{majority}} of women with rheumatoid arthritis (RA) experience disease amelioration during pregnancy for unclear reasons. One possible explanation pursued and described here is whether the placenta produces a protein similar to the immunomodulating protein, ES- 62, excreted by filarial nematodes. This protein {{has also been shown}} to reduce disease activity in animal models of RA. Eleven <b>human</b> <b>placentas</b> were prepared and a polyclonal anti-ES- 62 antiserum was used to identify if any ES- 62 -like molecule exists from human placental tissues. Any bands identified were then excised from the gel and sent for mass spectrometry and protein identification. The anti-serum showed consistent cross reactivity with the heavy chain from immunoglobulin G (IgG) from the eleven <b>human</b> <b>placentas</b> by mass spectrometry. No primary sequence homology between the heavy chain of IgG and ES- 62 was identified. The placenta does not produce an ES- 62 -like molecule. However the binding of the antiserum to the Fc region of IgG suggests that this may be a possible mechanism for rheumatoid factor production in some patients with chronic filarial infections...|$|R
40|$|Monoamine oxidase A (MAOA) and the {{transporters}} for serotonin (5 -HTT) and norepinephrine (NET) {{may play}} {{important roles in}} regulating maternal monoamine neurotransmitters transferred across the placenta to the fetus. We investigated whether promoter polymorphisms in MAOA (uVNTR), 5 -HTT (5 -HTTLPR), and NET (NETpPR AAGG 4) could influence gene expression and protein activity in <b>human</b> <b>placentas.</b> Normal term <b>human</b> <b>placentas</b> (n = 73) were collected, and placental MAOA, 5 -HTT, and NET mRNA levels and protein activity were determined. The mRNA levels or protein activities were compared between different genotype groups. Placentas hemizygous (male fetus) or homozygous (female fetus) for MAOA uVNTR 4 -repeat allele had significantly higher MAOA mRNA levels than those hemizygous or homozygous for the 3 -repeat allele (P = 0. 001). However, {{no significant difference in}} MAOA enzyme activity was found for these two groups of genotypes (P = 0. 161). Placentas with the 5 -HTTLPR short (S) -allele (S/S+S/L) had significantly lower 5 -HTT mRNA levels and serotonin uptake rate than those homozygous for the long (L) -allele (L/L) (mRNA: P < 0. 001; serotonin transporting activity: P < 0. 001). Placentas homozygous for the NET AAGG 4 L 4 allele had significantly higher NET mRNA levels, as well as dopamine and norepinephrine uptake rates, than those with the S 4 /L 4 genotype (mRNA: P < 0. 001; dopamine transporting activity: P = 0. 012; norepinephrine transporting activity: P = 0. 011). These findings suggest that the three promoter polymorphisms of MAOA, 5 -HTT, and NET influence gene expression levels and protein activity of these genes in <b>human</b> <b>placentas,</b> potentially leading to different fetal levels of maternal monoamine neurotransmitters, which may have an impact on fetal neurodevelopment...|$|R
