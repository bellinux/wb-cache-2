To sense existence of licensed user, Energy Detection based spectrum sensing technique is used over different wireless <b>fading</b> <b>channels.</b> Performance metrics like probability of false alarm, probability of detection and signal to noise ratio are evaluated by analyzing receiver operating characteristics. This paper presents a simulation comparison among different wireless <b>fading</b> <b>channels.</b> The results show that probability of detection is improved in all <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> and Nakagami-m <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> gives more improved performance than other <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> by using Energy Detection Spectrum Sensing Technique...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Most space–time {{codes in}} the {{literature}} were proposed based on two ideal channel conditions: either quasi-static or rapid fading. However, these codes may suffer performance degradation due to temporal correlation caused by {{the movement of the}} mobile terminal or imperfect interleaving. In this correspondence, we provide a novel analytical framework for the diversity analysis of space–time modulation in time-correlated fading environment. We show that the space–time signals of square size achieving full diversity in quasi-static <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> also achieve full diversity in time-correlated <b>fading</b> <b>channels,</b> independently of the time correlation matrix. Consequently, various classes of space–time signals designed for quasi-static <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> can also be used for full-diversity transmission over time-correlated <b>fading</b> <b>channels.</b> Moreover, we show that if the time correlation matrix is of full rank, the design criteria for time-correlated <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> are the same as those for rapid <b>fading</b> <b>channels.</b> To illustrate the theoretical results, some simulations were also performed under various temporal fading conditions.

Just as the bandwidth of intentional AM increases with the modulation rate, fading spreads a signal over a frequency range that increases with the fading rate. This is Doppler spreading, the frequency domain counterpart of coherence time. The shorter the coherence time, {{the greater the}} Doppler spread and vice versa.|$|E

50|$|In {{wireless}} communications, fading is {{variation of}} the attenuation of a signal with various variables. These variables include time, geographical position, and radio frequency.

First, we develop a simple and accurate analytic technique to evaluate the performance of turbo codes in quasi-static <b>fading</b> <b>channels.</b> The proposed analytic technique relates the frame error rate of a turbo code to the iterative decoder convergence threshold, {{rather than to the}} turbo code distance spectrum. Subsequently, we compare the performance of various turbo codes in quasi-static <b>fading</b> <b>channels.</b> We show that, in contrast to the situation in the AWGN channel, turbo codes with different interleaver sizes or turbo codes based on RSC codes with different constraint lengths and generator polynomials exhibit identical performance. Moreover, we also compare the performance of turbo codes and convolutional codes in quasi-static <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> under the condition of identical decoding complexity. In particular, we show that turbo codes do not outperform convolutional codes in quasi-static <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> with no antenna diversity; and that turbo codes only outperform convolutional codes in quasi-static <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> with antenna diversity...|$|R

30|$|In this article, we use finite-sate Markov channel (FSMC) models. FSMC {{models have}} widely been {{accepted}} in the literature as an effective approach to characterize the correlation structure of wireless channels. These include the following channels: satellite channels [24], indoor <b>channels</b> [25], Rayleigh <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> [26], Ricean <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> [27], and Nakagami <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> [28]. Considering FSMC models can enable substantial performance improvement over the schemes with memoryless channel models [29, 30].|$|R
50|$|For example, {{the channel}} {{capacity}} for slow-fading channel is C = log2(1 + h2 SNR), where h is the fading coefficient and SNR is {{a signal to}} noise ratio without fading. As C is random, no constant rate is available. There may be a chance that information rate may go below to required threshold level. For slow <b>fading</b> <b>channel,</b> outage probability = P(C < r) = P(log2(1 + h2 SNR) < r), where r is the required threshold information rate.|$|E
50|$|As {{described}} above, a Rayleigh <b>fading</b> <b>channel</b> {{itself can}} be modelled by generating the real and imaginary parts of a complex number according to independent normal Gaussian variables. However, it is sometimes the case that it is simply the amplitude fluctuations that are of interest (such as in the figure shown above). There are two main approaches to this.

40|$|Abstract — This paper {{presents}} the performance analysis and code design for differential space-time trellis code (DSTTC) when no channel state information (CSI) {{is available at}} neither the transmitter nor receiver. Upper bounds on the pairwise error probability of DSTTC over fast fading and quasi-static <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> are derived and new design criteria are proposed based on these bounds. It is shown that the performance of DSTTC {{is determined by the}} minimum weighted square product distance (WSPD) over independent fast <b>fading</b> <b>channels,</b> and by the min-imum cross correlation distance (CCD) over quasi-static <b>fading</b> <b>channels.</b> New DSTTCs are found by a systematic code search.

40|$|Trellis coded {{modulation}} (TCM) is a bandwidth efficient transmission {{scheme that}} can achieve high coding gain by integrating coding and modulation. This paper presents an analytical expression for the error event probability of concatenated space-time block coding with TCM which reveals some dominant factors affecting the system performance over slow <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> when perfect interleavers are used. This leads to establishing the design criteria for constructing optimal trellis codes of such concatenated system over slow flat <b>fading</b> <b>channels.</b> Through simulation, significant performance improvement {{is shown to}} be obtained by concatenating the interleaved streams of these codes with space-time block codes over <b>fading</b> <b>channels.</b> Simulation results also demonstrate that these trellis codes have better error performance than traditional codes designed for single-antenna Gaussian or <b>fading</b> <b>channels.</b> Performance results over quasi-static <b>fading</b> <b>channels</b> without interleaving are also compared in this paper.

50|$|How rapidly {{the channel}} fades will be {{affected}} by how fast the receiver and/or transmitter are moving. Motion causes Doppler shift in the received signal components. The figures show the power variation over 1 second of a constant signal after passing through a single-path Rayleigh <b>fading</b> <b>channel</b> with a maximum Doppler shift of 10 Hz and 100 Hz. These Doppler shifts correspond to velocities of about 6 km/h (4 mph) and 60 km/h (40 mph) respectively at 1800 MHz, one of the operating frequencies for GSM mobile phones. This is the classic shape of Rayleigh fading. Note in particular the 'deep fades' where signal strength can drop by a factor of several thousand, or 30-40 dB.|$|E
50|$|The {{coherence}} {{time of the}} channel is related to a quantity known as the Doppler spread of the channel. When a user (or reflectors in its environment) is moving, the user's velocity causes {{a shift in the}} frequency of the signal transmitted along each signal path. This phenomenon is known as the Doppler shift. Signals traveling along different paths can have different Doppler shifts, corresponding to different rates of change in phase. The difference in Doppler shifts between different signal components contributing to a signal <b>fading</b> <b>channel</b> tap is known as the Doppler spread. Channels with a large Doppler spread have signal components that are each changing independently in phase over time. Since fading depends on whether signal components add constructively or destructively, such channels have a very short {{coherence time}}.|$|E
50|$|In {{a recent}} study, a novel {{collaborative}} multi-user transmission and detection scheme called collaborative CDMA {{has been investigated}} for the uplink that exploits the differences between users' <b>fading</b> <b>channel</b> signatures to increase the user capacity well beyond the spreading length in MAI-limited environment. The authors show {{that it is possible}} to achieve this increase at a low complexity and high bit error rate performance in flat fading channels, which is a major research challenge for overloaded CDMA systems. In this approach, instead of using one sequence per user as in conventional CDMA, the authors group a small number of users to share the same spreading sequence and enable group spreading and despreading operations. The new collaborative multi-user receiver consists of two stages: group multi-user detection (MUD) stage to suppress the MAI between the groups and a low-complexity maximum-likelihood detection stage to recover jointly the co-spread users' data using minimal Euclidean-distance measure and users' channel-gain coefficients.|$|E
