5|$|In 1954, Bethe testified {{on behalf}} of J. Robert Oppenheimer during the Oppenheimer {{security}} hearing. Specifically, Bethe argued that Oppenheimer's stances against developing the hydrogen bomb in the late 1940s had not hindered its actual development, a topic which {{was seen as a}} key motivating factor behind the hearing. Bethe contended that the developments which led to the successful Teller–Ulam design were a matter of serendipity and not a question of manpower or logical development of previously existing ideas. During the hearing, Bethe and his wife also tried <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Edward Teller against testifying. However, Teller did not agree, and his testimony {{played a major role in}} the revocation of Oppenheimer's security clearance. While Bethe and Teller had been on very good terms during the prewar years, the conflict between them during the Manhattan Project, and especially during the Oppenheimer episode, permanently marred their relationship.|$|E
5|$|One {{matter in}} which he {{invested}} much effort was the political situation of the Viceroyalty of Peru. In Peru, power struggles between conquistadors and the viceroy became an open civil war in which the conquistadors led by Gonzalo Pizarro rebelled against the New Laws and defeated and executed the viceroy Blasco Núñez Vela in 1546. The Emperor sent Pedro de la Gasca, a friend of Las Casas, to reinstate the rule of law, and he in turn defeated Pizarro. In order to restabilize the political situation the encomenderos started pushing {{not only for the}} repeal of the New Laws, but for turning the encomiendas into perpetual patrimony of the encomenderos – the worst possible outcome from Las Casas's point of view. The encomenderos offered to buy the rights to the encomiendas from the crown, and Charles V was inclined to accept since his wars had left him in deep economic troubles. Las Casas worked <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the king {{that it would be a}} bad economic decision, that it would return the viceroyalty to the brink of open rebellion, and could result in the crown losing the colony entirely. The Emperor, probably because of the doubts caused by Las Casas's arguments, never took a final decision on the issue of the encomiendas.|$|E

25|$|It is {{difficult}} to assess the prognosis of a patient because it is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> chronic alcoholics to abstain from drinking alcohol completely. It {{has been shown that}} a good prognosis may be given for mild neuropathy if the alcoholic has abstained from drinking for 3–5 years. During {{the early stages of the}} disease the damage appears reversible when people take adequate amounts of vitamins, such as thiamine. If the polyneuropathy is mild, the individual normally experiences a significant improvement and symptoms may be completely eliminated within weeks to months after proper nutrition is established. When those people diagnosed with alcohol polyneuropathy experience a recovery, it is presumed to result from regeneration and collateral sprouting of the damaged axons.|$|E
25|$|On 2 March 1880, on his {{way from}} London to Switzerland, Gordon had visited King Leopold II of Belgium in Brussels and was invited {{to take charge of}} the Congo Free State. Leopold tried very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Gordon to enter his service, not least because Gordon was known to be modest in his salary demands, unlike Leopold's current agent in the Congo, Henry Morton Stanley, who {{received}} a monthly salary of 300,000 Belgian francs. Gordon rejected Leopold's offers, partly because he was still emotionally attached to the Sudan and partly because he disliked the idea of working for Leopold's Congo Association, which was a private company owned by the King. In April, the government of the Cape Colony offered him the position of commandant of the Cape local forces, which Gordon declined. A deeply depressed Gordon wrote in his letter declining the offer that he knew, for reasons that he refused to explain, that he had only ten years left to live, and he wanted to do something great and grand in his last ten years.|$|E

Likewise, Kine asserted that [...] "the badass she has tried so <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> us all she is finally came across."

50|$|Atkinson and Vogel both agreed, however, that {{borrowing}} by {{provincial government}} (as {{opposed to the}} central government) was indeed out of control. The two also believed that provincial politicians were petty and self-interested, and that more co-operation was needed between provinces and the state. It was this shared view of provincial government that enabled Vogel and Atkinson to co-operate, although they never resolved their differences on borrowing by the central government or on dealings with the Māori. Atkinson eventually became part of Vogel's cabinet, but not with portfolios related to negotiations with Māori or to finance. He did continue to express his opinions on these matters, but found it increasingly <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> people of his views.|$|R
500|$|The primary {{characters}} in The Other Hand are Little Bee, a Nigerian refugee, and Sarah, a middle-class Englishwoman. Critics {{have focused on}} the contrast between the two, with Caroline Elkins of The New York Times commenting that Sarah might initially appear [...] "insipid" [...] to readers, and that when juxtaposed with Little Bee, she seems [...] "unsympathetic, even tiresome". Tim Teeman of The Times deemed Sarah [...] "batty, bizarre and inconsistent, and despite the tragedy she has suffered, unsympathetic", while writing that in contrast: [...] "Goodness peppers every atom of [...] being." [...] Other reviewers took an opposite stance. Margot Kaminski of the San Francisco Chronicle found Little Bee's characterisation problematic, writing: [...] "Sometimes she's not convincing, and sometimes she tries too <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince.</b> It's too often apparent that Little Bee is not real. This doesn't do justice to her story, and puts the burden back on the author to show that he's representing her, rather than exploiting her." [...] Ed Lake of The Daily Telegraph felt that [...] "Bee's arch reasonableness and implausibly picturesque speech mean she often comes off as a too-cute cipher", and ultimately found Sarah the more convincing character.|$|E

500|$|The film had broader {{cultural}} repercussions, as well. Similar {{to the way}} {{the pivotal}} scene in 1960's Psycho made showers a new source of anxiety, Jaws led many viewers to fear going into the ocean. Reduced beach attendance in 1975 was attributed to it, as well as an increased number of reported shark sightings. It is still seen as responsible for perpetuating negative stereotypes about sharks and their behavior, and for producing the so-called [...] "Jaws effect", which allegedly inspired [...] "legions of fishermen [...] piled into boats and killed thousands of the ocean predators in shark-fishing tournaments." [...] Benchley stated that he would not have written the original novel had he known what sharks are really like in the wild.

2500|$|English {{historian}} Peter Cain, {{has challenged}} Mantena, {{arguing that the}} imperialists truly believed that British rule would bring to the subjects the benefits of ‘ordered liberty’, thereby Britain could fulfil its moral duty and achieve its own greatness.

2500|$|Welch starred as {{a freedom}} fighter leader in 100 Rifles, a 1969 western {{directed}} by Tom Gries and filmed in Almeria, Spain. It also starred Jim Brown, Burt Reynolds and Fernando Lamas. The movie provoked publicity and controversy {{at the time}} because it included a love scene between Welch and Brown that breached the Hollywood taboo of on-screen miscegenation. The film is remembered for the famous and spectacular [...] "Shower Scene" [...] in which Welch distracts the soldiers on the train by taking a shower at a water tower along the tracks. The director, Gries, tried <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> Welch to do the scene naked, but she refused.

50|$|Another way {{to debate}} against a {{disadvantage}} is an impact turn, {{in which the}} affirmative team reads evidence stating that the disadvantages impact would actually be good or that the status quo creates a worse impact. If the impact to a disad was global nuclear war, an impact turn would say that death is good or that the status quo creates a bigger nuclear war. Often impact turns function at the level above this. The argument is then sometimes called an internal link turn. For example, if the disadvantage argued that the plan hurt free trade, which was key to avoiding war, the affirmative might argue that in fact free trade caused war, environmental destruction, and other negative consequences. This type of turn is often much <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> the judge of (in {{part because of the}} structure of a debate round, in particular, the negative block), but some believe that it makes a round much more interesting.|$|R
2500|$|In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum {{created a}} program which {{appeared}} to pass the Turing test. The program, known as ELIZA, worked by examining a user's typed comments for keywords. If a keyword is found, a rule that transforms the user's comments is applied, and the resulting sentence is returned. If a keyword is not found, ELIZA responds either with a generic riposte or by repeating one of the earlier comments. In addition, Weizenbaum developed ELIZA to replicate the behaviour of a Rogerian psychotherapist, allowing ELIZA to be [...] "free to assume the pose of knowing almost nothing of the real world." [...] With these techniques, Weizenbaum's program was able to fool some people into believing that they were talking to a real person, with some subjects being [...] "very <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> that ELIZA [...] is not human." [...] Thus, ELIZA is claimed {{by some to be}} one of the programs (perhaps the first) able to pass the Turing Test, even though this view is highly contentious (see below).|$|E

40|$|After {{the private}} sector the public sector also tries {{to benefit from the}} {{advantages}} of electronic service delivery, in particular from lower costs and higher accessibility. While more and more services are available electronically, citizens' usage rates lag behind. The e-government research community identified this issue and increasingly analyzes the demand side: Researchers investigated the acceptance of existing electronic services (e. g. implemented taxpaying systems) or means to reach "more resistant" groups of society by electronic services, e. g. citizens without internet access. Besides more resistant users, which are <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>convince</b> of electronic services, there might be more demanding types of services. Such services are, from the perspective of almost all users, less amenable for electronic delivery than other (i. e. not demanding) services. This study employs qualitative research methods in a case study design and identifies three main (service related) determinants that cause citizens to prefer traditional, i. e. physical and personal contact, over impersonal "virtual" contact...|$|R

40|$|Pairs of liars and {{pairs of}} truth tellers were interviewed {{and the amount}} of eye contact they made with the {{interviewer}} and each other was coded.
