500|$|From Autumn to Ashes {{formed on}} Long Island in 2000 with Francis Mark (drums, vocals), Steve Salvio (guitar) and Benjamin Perri (vocals) — Perri {{provided}} screaming vocals, while Mark sung clean vocals. Commenting {{on the name}} of their band, Scott Gross (guitar) said, [...] "you are absolutely {{not going to get the}} right answer on this one because that would pretty much end the band" [...] and that [...] "no one is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> the reason and we are going to keep it that way." [...] The term [...] "Autumn" [...] refers to both the season and a fictional character the band created. Mark and Gross planned to use the character in a book. For the first few months as a touring band, From Autumn to Ashes claimed to have sold half of their equipment, a car, and spent between $3,000 and $4,000 making demos and hand distributing them.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, {{founding}} members Page and Varela met online, where Varela saw the YouTube video of Page with Groban. Page {{suggested that they}} form [...] "a new kind of tenor group" [...] to compete on America's Got Talent (AGT). They found Ryu during an online search, {{and spent the next}} few weeks preparing for their audition in Los Angeles, which came just two days after the three met in person for the first time. Forte's performance of [...] "Pie Jesu" [...] won praise from the judges; Howard Stern said they had the element of surprise because they looked like schlubs, but next time [...] "we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> that you're not schlubs, but you're fantastic singers". Howie Mandel said the trio was like the premise to a joke: a Latino, a Korean and a New Yorker [...] "walk into a bar, and record a giant hit record. You guys are phenomenal." ...|$|E
500|$|She went {{to drive}} the No. 99 Ford Thunderbird, owned by the poorly-funded Colburn Racing team for the 1995 season, and planned to run five races in the Winston Cup Series along with a full season in the Busch Series. Robinson {{attempted}} to enter the Daytona 500, but failed to qualify after finishing 26th in the first Gatorade Twin 125s event. Robinson secured two top-20 finishes in the Busch Series in the team's No. 36 car, but retired from racing after four events {{to start a family}} with her husband Jeff Clark. She declined an offer to test at Daytona International Speedway while {{in the early stages of}} pregnancy. Shortly before the birth of her two children, Robinson started her interior-decorating business from her home, and painted murals for homes and businesses. She said of her decision to have children: [...] "Racing is part of who I am, If I became a different person because I had kids, then the kids were not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> who I was my whole life before them." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The Fight Song" [...] was {{released}} as the album's second single on February 19, 2001 in the UK. A remix {{of the song}} by Joey Jordison of Slipknot appeared as its B-side. Its music video was directed by Manson and W.I.Z. and sparked controversy for its violent depiction of an American football game between jocks and goths, with NME accusing it of being exploitative of the Columbine tragedy. Manson dismissed the claims as hype, and said: [...] "I'm trying to show that sports as well as music {{can be seen as}} violent, so I chose a traditional black vs white, good vs evil theme for the video." [...] Manson appeared on an April 2001 episode of The O'Reilly Factor, where he once again denied that the band's music was responsible for Columbine. Bill O'Reilly argued that [...] "disturbed kids" [...] without direction from responsible parents could misinterpret the message of his music as endorsing the belief that [...] "when I'm dead [...] everybody's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> me." [...] Manson responded: ...|$|E
500|$|According to Gaga, {{playing at}} the Roseland Ballroom was always a dream of hers. She {{explained}} to John Seabrook of The New Yorker that [...] "It's basically the only room in the city I haven't played." [...] As a young girl, she could not afford tickets, but she did manage to win free tickets to a Franz Ferdinand show during her {{senior year of high}} school. Gaga recalled that she fell down during the show and got her nose broken, making her parents forbid her from visiting Roseland. After the singer's career took off with the release of debut album, The Fame (2008), she bypassed {{playing at the}} venue until its closure. Gaga revealed the official poster for the residency on March 18, 2014. The poster features an image of Gaga that was taken by a stranger in 2008 at the Lower East Side of New York City. According to Gaga: [...] "We found him and used that same photo for my Roseland poster." [...] The poster also includes a quote from Gaga taken when the photograph was taken, that reads: [...] "I'm Lady Gaga. A singer/songwriter. You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> me one day." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} to {{the episode}} was largely positive. Television Without Pity ranked [...] "Patient X" [...] the eighth most nightmare-inducing {{episode of the}} show, citing, in particular the abuse of Dmitri. The article noted that [...] "If The X-Files has taught us anything, it’s that if a G-Man asks us if we know anything about anything and we foolishly say yes, our mouths and eyelids will be sewn shut {{and we will be}} brainwashed to kill on demand." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Todd VanDerWerff gave [...] "Patient X" [...] a B+, and wrote that the episode [...] "feels epic, in a way the mythology episodes do at their best". However, VanDerWerff noted that [...] "The problem with breaking the status quo on a TV series is that your audience is always <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> in the back of its head that the status quo isn’t really broken." [...] He reasoned that the audience never fully believed that [...] "Mulder could lose his belief in the all-consuming alien conspiracy" [...] or accept the idea that [...] "Scully could find herself dabbling with belief in [...]" [...] Despite these set-backs, however, he noted that [...] "Patient X" [...] was the episode where the series' mythology [...] "gets moving again, after chasing its own tail throughout much of season four and reaching a sort of climax in the opening episodes of season five." [...] Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson, in their book Wanting to Believe: A Critical Guide to The X-Files, Millennium & The Lone Gunmen, rated the episode four stars out of five. The two described the tone of [...] "Patient X" [...] as [...] "truly visceral", citing the faceless men incinerating people as well as the mutilation of the innocent Dmitri, who was [...] "at {{the wrong place at the}} wrong time". Furthermore, Shearman and Pearson praised the episode for [...] "shift the goalposts" [...] and allowing Mulder and Scully to switch roles as the believer and skeptic. Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it two-and-a-half stars out of four. Vitaris praised the episode's premise and writing. [...] "'Patient X' is a rare episode in that it actually advances The X-Files mythology, with the news of a vaccine to combat the black oil". However, she was critical of the episode's reliance on shock value, noting that the [...] "camera seems to take a perverse delight in death, pain, and mutilation, with the distressing effect of numbing the viewer to the horror." ...|$|E

2500|$|Bambi relates in the biography, Indian Larry: Chopper Shaman, {{stories about}} how she first knew about Larry and the {{experiences}} that occurred before they came {{to be in a}} relationship. [...] Before they officially started to date in 1997, they hung out together at a bar and Larry kept putting quarters in the jukebox, playing romantic songs by Roy Orbison and Patsy Cline. [...] This was when he was still drinking, and Bambi wrote that at one point he started crying, and said to her, “No one else is ever really <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> my soul". And Bambi thought to herself, “I will. I could do that.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The scene {{featuring}} Brian {{jumping off}} a bus {{off a cliff}} was performed by a stuntman and was all done without any computer graphics. The shooting for this particular sequence along with the scene in which Dom and his team are pursuing to rescue Ramsey almost didn't happen due {{to the absence of}} tax break in Colorado. The studio originally wanted to shoot the sequence in Georgia which provides tax breaks for film productions, and then they'd add woods in the background later in post production to which Razatos denied saying, [...] "the audience is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> [...] and aren't going to feel good about it." [...] Shooting finally took place in Colorado.|$|E
2500|$|In November 1988, Judit and her sisters, {{along with}} Ildikó Mádl, {{represented}} Hungary in the Women's {{section of the}} 28th Chess Olympiad in Thessaloniki. The International Chess Federation would not permit the Polgárs to play against men in team competitions. Prior to the tournament, Eduard Gufeld, Soviet GM and team coach for the Soviet women's team, dismissed the Polgárs: [...] "I believe that these girls {{are going to lose}} a good part of their quickly acquired image in the 28th Olympiad...Afterward we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> if the Hungarian sisters are geniuses or just women!" [...] However, Hungary's women's team won the championship, which marked the first time it was not won by the Soviet Union. Judit played board 2 and finished the tournament with the highest score of 12½–½ to win the individual gold medal. She also won the brilliancy prize for her game against Pavlina Angelova.|$|E

2500|$|Freight trains {{operated}} by MMA were allowed (not [...] "permitted", see below) by regulators in Canada (Transport Canada) and the United States (Federal Railroad Administration) to have Single Person Train Operation (SPTO, alternately OPTO) status (1 operator). The [...] "permit" [...] process, which requires public input, was not followed. The Canadian regulator and the MMA {{entered into a}} negotiation process at the culmination of which, sometime before {{the second week of}} July 2012, the government allowed MMA to reduce their manpower to SPTO. An average of 80 tankcars per train was carried on this route under the supervision of one person only. The Maine regulator had already allowed SPTO status before the first week of April 2012. The use of SPTO for MMA freight trains was a cost-cutting move for which the railway company has received much criticism. In May 2010, former MMA engineer Jarod Briggs of Millinocket, Maine explained to the Bangor Daily News that “so much could happen in a 12-hour shift on one of these trains, such as a washed-out track, downed trees or mechanical failure. What if the engineer onboard were to encounter a medical problem? Who is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>know</b> about it? If there is a fire engine or an ambulance needing to get by a train or a crossing when that happens, it could take hours.” Briggs left MMA to work for another railway in 2007; while he described the lone crew member involved in the Lac-Mégantic derailment as [...] "a very good engineer, one of the better on the property", he has long expressed safety concerns about the company's overall train operations because “if you have two people watching you can catch a mistake. It was all about cutting, cutting, cutting.” ...|$|E
