2500|$|In {{contrast}} to Lijphart, several political scientists and policy analysts have condemned consociationalism. One {{of the many}} critiques is that consociationalism locks in ethnic tensions and identities. This assumes a primordial stance that ethnic identities are permanent and not subject to change. Furthermore, this {{does not allow for}} any [...] "others" [...] that might want to partake in the political process. [...] As of 2012 a Jewish Bosnian <b>is</b> <b>suing</b> <b>the</b> Bosnian government from precluding him from running for presidential office since only a Croat, Serb, or Bosniak can run under the consociational government. Determining ethnic identities in advance and implementing a power sharing system {{on the basis of these}} fixed identities is inherently discriminatory against minority groups that might be not be recognized. Moreover, it discriminates against those who do not choose to define their identity on an ethnic or communal basis. In power sharing-systems that are based on pre-determined identities, there is a tendency to rigidly fix shares of representation on a permanent basis which will not reflect changing demographics over time. The categorization of individuals in particular ethnic groups might be controversial anyway and might in fact fuel ethnic tensions.|$|E

2500|$|The New York Attorney General is {{investigating}} whether ExxonMobil's statements to investors {{were consistent with}} the companyâs decades of extensive scientific research. The Martin Act in New York state law gives the state Attorney General broad powers to investigate financial fraud. On November 4, 2015 the New York Attorney General issued a subpoena to ExxonMobil. The New York Attorney General investigation includes possible violations of consumer protection, fraud, and securities law. ExxonMobil denied withholding climate change research.
