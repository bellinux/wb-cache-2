5|$|Clayton {{was born}} in 1831 in Hampshire County, Virginia (present-day West Virginia). He {{received}} his early education at <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> father, Dr. Townsend Clayton, and attended Romney Academy and the Romney Classical Institute. Clayton continued his post-secondary education at the University of Virginia between 1846 and 1848. Following his graduation, he served as principal of Washington Academy in Amelia County, the Charlestown Academy in Charles Town, and the Romney Classical Institute in 1853 and 1866. He began practicing law in Romney in 1859, and relocated to Keyser in 1873 where he established a law practice.|$|E
5|$|He {{abandoned}} {{the study of}} medicine and changed to English, history, and theology. Because he switched his field, however, he lost his scholarship and had to pay tuition fees. He received a government bursary, and his family also donated money– his older brother Augustine gave up money for a trip <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> job as a civil servant so Chinua could continue his studies. From its inception, the university had a strong Arts faculty; it includes many famous writers amongst its alumni. These include Nobel Laureate Wole Soyinka, poet and playwright John Pepper Clark, and poet Christopher Okigbo. Elechi Amadi is also another famous writer who studied at the university in the 1950s, although {{he was in the}} faculty of sciences.|$|E
5|$|He {{originally}} recorded Lagos for his use in-studio, {{but when}} presented {{with the idea of}} sharing the sound for artistic installation, he began to edit the clips for their best representation of Lagos and considered the best method of public dissemination. <b>Home</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> Egyptian art program, Ogboh was inspired to create the Lagos Soundscapes project when the artist was able to identify the sounds of his city during a phone call with a friend. As he transitioned to the field, he turned to online help in discussion forums and email. In his installations, Ogboh prefers audio that requires minimal studio manipulation, and does not significantly alter the sounds. Some audio effects come from the recording environment, both surfaces that echo and distort sound, and the effect of traveling with a recorder. His first sound installation was in the Fayoum academy's bathroom, followed by his first Lagos Soundscapes installation at the Lagos African Artists' Foundation in 2009. Ogboh remembered reception mostly around his work's novelty.|$|E

25|$|As the girls' coffins {{were led}} to their graves, Dr. King ordered that those present remain solemn and forbid any singing, {{shouting}} or demonstrations. These instructions were relayed to the crowd present by a single youth with a bullhorn.

25|$|In 1855, Lewis {{was killed}} by the husband {{of a woman with}} whom he had been having an affair. On July 1, 1856, a court sale of Lewis' {{property}} (including the undivided half-interest {{in the land of the}} Ranch) was held. King had arranged for Maj W.W. Chapman (died 1859) to bid on the Rincón property, which Chapman acquired for $1,575. Chapman had been the quartermaster of Fort Brown in Brownsville, and regulated the steamboat contracts to supply Fort Ringgold, up river in Rio Grande City. Chapman's heirs published the letters <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> wife in a new book named The News From Brownsville.|$|E
25|$|In 1897, Dr. Haddon had {{obtained}} his Sc.D. degree {{in recognition of}} the work he had already done, some of which he had incorporated in his Decorative art of New Guinea, a large monograph published as one of the Cunningham Memoirs in 1894, and on his return <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> second expedition he was elected a Fellow of his College (Junior Fellow in 1901, Senior Fellow in 1904). He was appointed Lecturer in Ethnology in the University of Cambridge in 1900, and Reader in 1909, a post from which he retired in 1926. He was appointed advisory curator to the Horniman Museum in London in 1901. Haddon paid a third visit to New Guinea in 1914, and returned during the First World War.|$|E

25|$|On the Tibetan leader's journey <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> year in China, Khampa and Amdowa clan leaders {{informed}} {{his chief}} of staff of their plans to rebel against the Chinese in retribution for land confiscation and attacks on monasteries. But all was relatively quiet in Lhasa and in April 1956 he received a Chinese delegation to inaugurate the Preparatory Committee for the Autonomous Region of Tibet: a 51-man committee composed mostly of Tibetans. Meanwhile, open rebellion began with the massacre of a Communist garrison in Kham which left an estimated 800 Chinese dead, sparking air strikes that killed more Tibetans. In addition, the CIA met with the Dalai Lama's two brothers Thubten Jigme Norbu and Gyalo Thondup in India and offered to train a pilot group of six Khampas in guerrilla warfare and radio communications in Saipan. They were smuggled out of Tibet and would later be parachuted back in to train others and to report back to the CIA on the insurgency's progress and needs.|$|E
25|$|One summer, Mr. O'Brien {{takes a long}} {{business}} trip. While he is away, {{the boys}} enjoy unfettered access to their mother, and Jack experiences the first twinges of rebelliousness. Goaded by other boys his age, Jack commits acts of vandalism and animal abuse. He later trespasses into a neighbor's house and steals her sheer nightgown. Jack is confused and angered by his feelings of sexuality and guilty trespass. He throws the stolen lingerie into a river to rid himself of it. Mr. O'Brien returns <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> business trip. Shortly thereafter, the plant that he works at closes and he is given the option of relocating {{to work in an}} inferior position within the firm or losing his job. He and his family pack up to move to the new job location. He laments the course his life has taken, questioning whether he has been a good enough person. He asks Jack for forgiveness for his harsh treatment of him.|$|E
25|$|Francisc Rainer was {{a native}} of Rohozna town, near Czernowitz, in Austrian-controlled Bukovina. His parents were Lutheran, but baptized their son Roman Catholic. His father, Gustav Adolf Ignatz Rainer, emigrated to the Romanian Old Kingdom as an {{employee}} of the Strusberg Company that built the Bucharest-Giurgiu railway, the country's first. Remaining there, he obtained a post in the administration of Căile Ferate Române. His mother Maria (or Ana) came from a clerical family, and was a housewife. The boy received his primary education at <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> parents, later attending Saint Sava National College. Among the teachers who were particularly helpful was Sabba Ștefănescu in natural sciences. Rainer read extensively, teaching himself Latin and Ancient Greek, and becoming passionate about the literary works of Goethe and the philosophy of Arthur Schopenhauer. He slowly discarded the latter's influence when he discovered Heraclitus, Ernst Haeckel, and classical materialistic thought. Such works diverted him from his original goal of becoming a Catholic missionary.|$|E

25|$|After {{returning}} <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> first overseas tour, Benaud was prolific {{during the}} 1953–54 Australian season, which was purely domestic with no touring Test team. He contributed significantly with both bat and ball in New South Wales' Sheffield Shield triumph, {{the first of}} nine consecutive titles. In the opening match of the season, he struck 158 and took 5/88 and 1/65 against Queensland. He made another century in the return match, striking 144 not out and taking a total of 2/55. Midway through the season, he played in Morris's XI in a testimonial match for Hassett, who captained the other team. Benaud scored 78 and 68 and took a total of 5/238, his dismissals being Davidson and frontline Test batsmen in a 121-run win. He then finished the summer strongly, and ended the season with 811 runs at 62.38 and 35 wickets at 30.54. Benaud was the only bowler selected for all five Tests of the 1954–55 series when England visited Australia. He secured his place after scoring 125 against Queensland {{at the start of}} the season, although his lead-up form in two matches against England for his state and an Australian XI was not encouraging.|$|E
25|$|After {{returning}} <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> {{boarding school}} for the summer, Percy and his mother, Sally Jackson, travel to their cabin in Montauk. However, the trip is cut short and {{after a series of}} harrowing incidents such as being attacked by a minotaur, Percy finds himself at Camp Half-Blood, a training camp for demigods like him. He discovers that he is a demigod son of Poseidon, the Greek god of the sea, earthquakes and father of all horses, that his best friend Grover is actually a satyr and that the Greek gods are accusing him of having stolen Zeus' master lightning bolt (the most powerful weapon in the world). To clear his name and save the world from another war between the Olympian gods, he sets out to retrieve the lightning bolt from Hades, who they believe is the real thief. Thus Percy Jackson and his companions, Grover Underwood and Annabeth Chase, a daughter of Athena, start on a journey to the underworld, facing numerous mythological monsters on the way. After confronting an innocent Hades, they learn that their friend Luke Castellan, son of Hermes, is the real thief who stole the bolt to allow Kronos, the defeated king of the Titans, a chance to rise again.|$|E
25|$|Nine-year-old Cassie Logan {{is walking}} {{to school with}} her {{siblings}} Stacey (twelve years old), Christopher-John (seven years old), and Little Man whose real name is Clayton Chester Logan (six years old) in rural Mississippi. Cassie talks about the land on which the Logan family lives. It belonged to Harlan Granger, but he sold 2000 acres of it in 1886 to cover his taxes during Reconstruction. Their grandfather bought two hundred acres in 1887, then another two hundred acres in 1918. After several miles of walking, T.J. Avery and his brother appear. The Avery family sharecrop on the Granger plantation. At school, Cassie and Little Man go to their classroom, where Cassie's teacher, Daisy Crocker, gives them their textbooks, worn-out, outdated castoffs from the white school with a chart that says only white kids used these books up until they were in bad condition, indicating their future uses are intended only for black students. Crocker meets with Cassie's mother, Mary, who calmly glues {{a piece of paper}} over the chart containing the racist indicator in all the books. She hands them back to a dumbstruck Crocker. That Saturday their father, David Logan, comes <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>his</b> railroad job in Louisiana, bringing with him L.T. Morrison to assist in planting, farming, protection and other jobs, as Morrison was fired from the railroad for a fight that was the white men's fault. Papa leaves the next day to catch a train.|$|E
