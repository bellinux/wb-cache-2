In the end the judge decides against him. Even so, Agenore cannot get hold of Serafino's money. Yet he learns that Serafino can still marry and then his wife would be his legal guardian and thus allowed to manage his <b>estate</b> <b>at</b> <b>will.</b> Later he tries to force Serafino into marrying Lidia. But again Serafino pretends to be too dumb to comply and once again this ploy is successful. In the end he marries Asmara and reprises his work as a shepherd.|$|E

5000|$|In land law, {{the term}} [...] "estate" [...] is {{a remnant of}} the English feudal system, which created a complex {{hierarchy}} of estates and interests in land. The allodial or fee simple interest is the most complete ownership that one can have of property in the common law system. An estate can be an estate for years, an <b>estate</b> <b>at</b> <b>will,</b> a life estate (extinguishing at {{the death of the}} holder), an estate pur auter vie (a life interest for the life of another person) or a fee tail estate (to the heirs of one's body) or some more limited kind of heir (e.g. to heirs male of one's body).|$|E

2500|$|The {{political}} clout of Fabius began to wane after this incident, as displeasure with his tactics grew in Rome. Hannibal, after escaping from the trap he had got himself into, marched east towards Apulia, ravaging the Roman <b>estates</b> <b>at</b> <b>will.</b> Fabius cautiously followed him still keeping to the Fabian strategy. He would order towns burned, and crops {{destroyed in the}} path of Hannibal. The scorched earth policy was designed to hamper the movement of the Carthaginian army, which, unlike the Roman one, did not have a secure supply chain and had to live off the land. The prudence of this tactic may have hampered the Carthaginians but the Romans were pushed to the limit of their patience because of this. Hannibal marched east through Samnium into Apulia, and selected the town of Geronium as his winter base. The Carthaginian would again dupe part of the army of Fabius in Battle of Geronium. The impatience of the Romans with Fabius would be a factor which would aid Hannibal in devising his [...] "trick".|$|R
