40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to compare the <b>force</b> <b>outputs</b> {{achieved}} during a squat exercise using a rotational inertia device in stable versus unstable conditions with different loads and in concentric and eccentric phases. Thirteen male athletes (mean ± SD: age 23. 7 ± 3. 0 years, height 1. 80 ± 0. 08 m, body mass 77. 4 ± 7. 9 kg) were assessed while squatting, performing one set of three repetitions with four different loads under stable and unstable conditions at maximum concentric effort. Overall, there were no significant differences between the stable and unstable conditions at each of the loads for any of the dependent variables. Mean force showed significant differences between some of the loads in stable and unstable conditions (P < 0. 010) and peak force output differed between all loads for each condition (P < 0. 045). Mean <b>force</b> <b>outputs</b> were greater in the concentric than in the eccentric phase under both conditions and with all loads (P < 0. 001). There were no significant differences in peak force between concentric and eccentric phases at any load in either stable or unstable conditions. In conclusion, squatting with a rotational inertia device allowed the generation of similar <b>force</b> <b>outputs</b> under stable and unstable conditions at each of the four loads. The study also provides empirical evidence of the different <b>force</b> <b>outputs</b> achieved by adjusting load conditions on the rotational inertia device when performing squats, especially in the case of peak force. Concentric <b>force</b> <b>outputs</b> were significantly higher than eccentric outputs, except for peak force under both conditions. These findings support the use of the rotational inertia device to train the squatting exercise under unstable conditions for strength and conditioning trainers.

Ten young men performed sustained grip tests with 2 grip types and 3 target forces for 6 min. Lactate and maximal grip strength were measured before, just after and 4 min and 7 min after each grip test. SMS of the forearm was measured every 30 s during and after each grip test. The relationships of average grip force in every 30 s between SIG and IRG were not good. The lactate values after IRG tests with 75 % and 100 % MVC tended {{to be higher than}} in the other conditions. The tendency for decline differs with grip type, intensity (target forces) and the <b>force</b> <b>outputs</b> among the conditions. The muscle fatigue level in the SIG and IRG tests may differ largely even when using the same target force.

An isometric handgrip task at a constant force (30 % of maximal voluntary contraction) was completed by individuals with DS (n = 29, age 26 yr), and healthy young (n = 26, age 27 yr) and older (n = 33, age 70 yr) individuals.

The development of one component of a biorobotic system, an artificial muscle and tendon, is documented here. The device is based on known static and dynamic properties of biological muscle and tendon which were extracted from the literature and used to mathematically describe the unique force, length, and velocity relationships. As biological tissue exhibits wide variation in performance, ranges are identified which encompass typical behavior for design purposes. The McKibben pneumatic actuator is proposed as the contractile element of the artificial muscle. A model is presented that includes not only the geometric properties of the actuator, but also the material properties of the actuator's inner bladder and frictional effects. Experimental evidence is presented that validates the model and shows the force-length properties to be muscle-like, while the force-velocity properties are not. The addition of a hydraulic damper is proposed to improve the actuator's velocity-dependent properties, complete with computer simulations and experimental evidence validating the design process. Furthermore, an artificial tendon is proposed to serve as connective tissue between the artificial muscle and a skeleton. A series of experimental tests verifies that the design provides suitable tendon-like performance.

With this system, the <b>force</b> <b>output</b> produced by participants can be detected and recorded in real time, while <b>force</b> <b>output</b> was visually displayed as a feedback cue to the participants simultaneously. Furthermore, this force feedback system is MRI compatible, and can be used both in fMRI and ERP experiments. The proposed system has been applied in hand-grip tasks and finger movement experiments, which were designed to explore the relationship between <b>force</b> <b>output</b> and brain activation mode in normal subject and stroke patient. The results demonstrated that various force levels were well detected and visual feedback signals enabled the accomplishment of experiments with both fixed and variable target force levels.

40|$|Objective: Previous Studies have {{revealed}} {{a loss of}} functioning motor units in stroke patients. However, it remained unclear whether the motor units are affected randomly or in some specific pattern. We assessed {{whether there is a}} selective loss of the large (high recruitment threshold) or the small (low recruitment threshold) motor units following a stroke. Methods: Forty-five stroke patients and 40 healthy controls participated in the study. Macro-EMG was recorded from the abductor digiti minimi muscle at two levels of <b>force</b> <b>output</b> (low and high). The median macro motor unit potential (macro-MUP) amplitude on the paretic side was compared with those on the unaffected side and in the controls. Results: In the control group and on the unaffected side, the rnacro-MUPs were significantly larger at the high <b>force</b> <b>output</b> than at the low one. However, on the paretic side the macro-MUPs at the high <b>force</b> <b>output</b> had the same amplitude as those recorded at the low <b>force</b> <b>output.</b> These changes correlated with the severity of the paresis. Conclusions: Following a stroke, there is a selective functional loss of the large, high-threshold motor units. These changes are related to the severity of the symptoms. Significance: Our findings furnish further insight into the pathophysiology of the motor deficit following a stroke. (C) 2008 International Federation of Clinical Neurophysiology.
