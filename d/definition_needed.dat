This revision integrates ISO/IEC 12207:1995 with its two amendments and was coordinated with the parallel revision of ISO/IEC 15288:2002 (System life cycle processes) to align structure, terms, and corresponding organizational and project processes. This standard may be used stand-alone or jointly with ISO/IEC 15288, and supplies a process reference model that supports process capability assessment in accordance with ISO/IEC 15504-2 (Process assessment).

5000|$|Bucher was psychologically {{tortured}} such {{as being}} put through a mock firing squad {{in an effort to}} make him confess. Eventually the Koreans threatened to execute his men in front of him, and Bucher relented and agreed to 'confess to his and the crew's transgression.' Bucher wrote the confession since a 'confession' by <b>definition</b> <b>needed</b> to be written by the confessor himself. They verified the meaning of what he wrote, but failed to catch the pun when he said [...] "We paean the North Korean state. We paean their great leader Kim Il Sung"("We paean" [...] sounds almost identical to [...] "we pee on"). Following an apology, a written admission by the U.S. that Pueblo had been spying, and an assurance that the U.S. would not spy in the future, the North Korean government decided to release the 82 remaining crew members. On 23 December 1968 the crew was taken by buses to the demilitarized zone (DMZ) border with South Korea and ordered to walk south across the [...] "Bridge of No Return". Exactly 11 months after being taken prisoner, Bucher led the long line of crewmen, followed at the end by the Executive Officer, Lieutenant Ed Murphy, the last man across the bridge. The U.S. then verbally retracted the ransom admission, apology, and assurance. Meanwhile, the North Koreans blanked out the paragraph above the signature which read: [...] "and this hereby receipts for 82 crewmen and one dead body" [...] (Fireman Duane Hodges was killed by North Korean gunfire during the taking of the Pueblo).|$|E

40|$|Abstract – A way {{to manage}} the {{information}} needed during the FE simulation model preparation is by means of attributes linked to the adopted models. This paper presents the design and implementation of an attribute management system that supports the representation of all the information and data related to the simulation domain <b>definition,</b> <b>needed</b> to qualify an engineering analysis. The main objective of such a system {{is to be able}} to attach, maintain, reuse and check the attributes during the FE simulation model preparation. Among the applications of such an attribute system there is the ability to maintain all the HLT representations (BCs, material, B-Rep topology) in the same HLT data structure called the evaluated HLT and dedicated to express and describe specific concepts as they can be needed at a given stage of the preparation process...|$|E

40|$|The {{practice}} {{of mechanical engineering}} for product development {{has evolved into a}} complex activity that requires a team of specialists for success. Sandia National Laboratories (SNL) has product engineers, mechanical designers, design engineers, manufacturing engineers, mechanical analysts and experimentalists, qualification engineers, and others that contribute through product realization teams to develop new mechanical hardware. The goal of SNL's Design Group is to change product development by enabling design teams to collaborate within a virtual model-based environment whereby analysis is used to guide design decisions. Computer-aided design (CAD) models using PTC's Pro/ENGINEER software tools are heavily relied upon in the product definition stage of parts and assemblies at SNL. The three-dimensional CAD solid model acts as the design solid model that is filled with all of the detailed design <b>definition</b> <b>needed</b> to manufacture the parts. Analysis {{is an important part of}} the product development process. The CAD design solid model (DSM) is the foundation for the creation of the analysis solid model (ASM). Creating an ASM from the DSM currently is a time-consuming effort; the turnaround time for results of a design needs to be decreased to have an impact on the overall product development. This effort can be decreased immensely through simple Pro/ENGINEER modeling techniques that summarize to the method features are created in a part model. This document contains recommended modeling techniques that increase the efficiency of the creation of the ASM from the DSM...|$|E
40|$|The power supply, fuel consumption, and noxious {{emissions}} {{of a vehicle}} depend on the use that is made of it. Usually [1] only the driving cycle {{is considered to be}} a sufficient way to gauge a vehicle’s usage. It is not, however, enough. Experimental tests have proved that, while similar driving cycles entail similar power demand, fuel consumption and emissions differ. In addition, a driving cycle, usually a synthesis [1 – 7] of several cycles collected experimentally, represents neither a specific link of the road network nor a specific user. Vehicle use must, accordingly, be described by something more comprehensive than the driving cycle, and this might be called the ‘use cycle’, for which a <b>definition</b> <b>needed</b> to be found. For a definition of the use cycle, all possible factors influencing vehicle emissions had to be examined. It was thus necessary to develop a tool both for gathering data that might reveal a different use of the vehicle and for identifying factors that might have an influence on emissions. The easiest, cheapest, and most versatile way to collect real data on the use of a vehicle is to use the vehicle’s own sensors connected to the on-board diagnostic (OBD- 2) port. Readings from a GPS can provide some characteristics related to the vehicle’s position. This paper describes the development of a tool for collecting real-time OBD and GPS information. The acquisition tool was validated by a number of tests on a dynamometer chassis and differences are never higher than 3 per cent (e. g. on speed max 2 km/h). The first result obtained on vehicle usage is that driver behaviour influences throttle position independently of the driving cycle. Even with similar driving cycles, the accelerator pedal position and its variations turned out to be heavily different, suggesting a new definition of driver behaviour linked to the way the driver uses the pedals. Such pedal movement does have an influence on the air–fuel ratio, which remains stable around the stoichiometric value with ‘calm’ use of the accelerator, while it changes continuously, never becoming stoichiometric, with ‘aggressive’ accelerator behaviour. The continuous use of the developed tool on large fleets of vehicles will allow progress along this path and help define use cycles that may then be used by car manufacturers to design vehicles more efficient in their different uses and by the authorities to force more stringent homologation rules...|$|E
