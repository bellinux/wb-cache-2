500|$|Arsenal captain Patrick Vieira {{revealed}} {{his intention to}} stay at the club, despite interest from Chelsea, who had been acquired by Russian billionaire Roman Abramovich in the summer. Manager Arsène Wenger used his press conference to look ahead to the new season and felt his team's chances were as good, if not better than Chelsea's: [...] "I can understand that we look a little bit poor and out of shape but what is important is what happens on the pitch and you will see that we look good. To write us off <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> haven't spent £100million is a bit easy." ...|$|E
500|$|The season {{one episode}} [...] "Death" [...] heavily {{influenced}} the film's screenplay. The plot and theme of both scripts revolves heavily around {{the parents of}} South Park protesting about Terrance and Phillip due to the perceived negative influence it has over their children. Parker said, [...] "After about {{the first year of}} South Park, Paramount already wanted to make a South Park movie, and we sort of thought this episode would make the best model <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> liked the sort of pointing at ourselves kind of thing." [...] During the time, the team was also busy writing the second and third seasons of the series, the former of which Parker and Stone later described as [...] "disastrous". As such, they figured the phenomenon would be over soon, and they decided to write a personal, fully committed musical.|$|E

"Death" [...] {{warns against}} such {{misplaced}} values and condemns {{the practice of}} censorship, as well as demonstrating there can be value in a show often dismissed as juvenile and immature, like South Park or Terrance and Phillip. The episode also takes the position that parents who blame their children's behavior entirely on television are evading true responsibility for problems that likely have roots elsewhere. The plot of [...] "Death" [...] heavily influenced the screenplay Parker and Stone wrote for their 1999 film, [...] The plot and theme of both scripts revolves heavily around the parents of South Park protesting Terrance and Phillip due to the perceived negative influence it has over their children.

500|$|Since I Left You was {{originally}} developed to be a concept album. Chater described its initial theme as a love story, [...] "an international search for love {{from country to}} country. The idea of a guy following a girl {{around the world and}} always being one port behind. And that was <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> had all these records from all over the world, and we'd like to use all that stuff." [...] The concept album idea was abandoned when the group felt they should not make their themes too obvious. The album's sound was in response to dance music at that time, that Chater felt was [...] "about big drums, big production: think of a record like the Chemical Brothers [...] "Block Rockin' Beats", with those amazing drums, and how huge those records sounded". The Avalanches felt their early music could not compare to that sound and desired a recording with less bass that was influenced by 1960s music such as the Beach Boys and Phil Spector.|$|E
500|$|Some {{responded to}} the {{backlash}} {{in a show of}} solidarity with Davuluri. Students at Duke University, and with Yale University's Asian American Cultural Center and the South Asian Society, created videos and ran photo campaigns denouncing the social media attacks, while Miss Kansas Theresa Vail blogged and gave interviews to discredit the comments about both herself and Davuluri. Actor and civil-rights activist George Takei (the original Hikaru Sulu in [...] ) posted a comment on Facebook stating that while he normally doesn't [...] "care about Miss America … the uproar over an Indian-American winning (whom many decried for being 'Arab') has me shaking my head. Please tell me I'm not alone in wondering whether we've learned anything at all." [...] University of Michigan student Munmun Khan also stated that while she doesn't like beauty pageants, she hates [...] "racism and bigotry even more [...] Not only was [...] the first Indian Miss New York, but she is now also the first Indian Miss America. All cause for celebration." [...] Finally, Immediate Past President, Young Democrats of America, Atima Omara, argued that [...] "a sexist, racist, xenophobic attack against one prominent woman of color is an attack against us all, and it shouldn't be tolerated <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> disdain that woman's choices. As an African-American woman with an ethnic name, I know the constant sting that comes from hearing how you are not American enough {{no matter how much you}} accomplish in the name of America." ...|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, Feige {{said that}} [...] "in an ideal world" [...] {{releases}} each year would include one film {{based on an}} existing character and one featuring a new character, saying it's [...] "a nice rhythm" [...] in that format. While not always the case, as evident by the 2013 releases of Iron Man 3 and Thor: The Dark World, he said it is [...] "certainly something to aim for." [...] Feige expanded on this in July 2014, saying, [...] "I don't know that we'll keep to [...] every year", but we're doing that in 2014 and 2015, [...] "so I {{think it would be}} fun to continue that sort of thing." [...] In February 2014, Feige stated that Marvel Studios wants to mimic the [...] "rhythm" [...] that the comic books have developed, by having the characters appear in their own films, and then come together, much like [...] "a big event or crossover series," [...] with Avengers films acting as [...] "big, giant linchpins." [...] After the reveal of multiple release dates for films through 2019 in July 2014, Feige stated, [...] "I think if you look at some of those dates that we've announced, we're going to three in a few of those years. Again, not because there's a number cruncher telling us to go to three, do more than two pictures a year, but because of the very reason just laid out: it is about managing [...] franchises, film to film, and when we have a team ready to go, why tell them to go away for four years <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> don't have a slot? We'd rather find a way to keep that going." [...] After the titles were revealed in October 2014, Feige said, [...] "The studio's firing on all cylinders right now ... which made us comfortable for the first time ... to increase to three films a year [...] instead of just two, without changing our methods." ...|$|E

2500|$|On November 30, 2005, Iraq's Foreign Minister, Hoshiyar Zebari, {{supported}} {{the idea of}} an Assyrian administrative region by saying [...] "They (Assyrians) are free to organize a province or regional government.

60|$|Hume answers this {{question}} in the fifth section, entitled, Why Utility Pleases. He repudiates the deduction of moral approbation from self-love, and utterly denies that we approve of benevolent or <b>just</b> actions <b>because</b> <b>we</b> think of the benefits which {{they are likely to}} confer indirectly on ourselves. The source of the approbation with which we view an act useful to society must be sought elsewhere; and, in fact, {{is to be found in}} that feeling which is called sympathy.|$|R

2500|$|When [...] "D.A.F." [...] {{was first}} released, Australian {{television}} program Recovery ran a competition asking one the song's title stood for. Powderfinger guitarist Darren Middleton recalls that [...] "people wrote in saying something like Dylan something farts" [...] (referring to then host Dylan Lewis), but Middleton {{stated that the}} title was actually the song's chord progression - D,A,F. When asked about the naming of the song, bassist John Collins replied [...] "It's <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> were stupid".|$|E
2500|$|According to Greenwood, {{he began}} playing bass out of necessity, {{teaching}} himself by playing along to New Order, Joy Division and Otis Redding. He said: [...] "We {{were people who}} picked up their respective instruments {{because we wanted to}} play music together, rather than <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> wanted to play that particular instrument. So {{it was more of a}} collective angle, and if you could contribute by having someone else play your instrument, then that was really cool. I don’t think of myself as a bass player anyway. I’m just in a band with other people." [...] Among his musical influences are Booker T and the MGs, Bill Withers and Curtis Mayfield.|$|E
2500|$|In June 2011, {{the group}} {{released}} a manifesto outlining why they performed hacks and website takedowns, reiterating that [...] "we do things <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> find it entertaining" [...] and that watching {{the results can}} be [...] "priceless". They also claimed to be drawing attention to computer security flaws and holes. They contended that many other hackers exploit and steal user information without releasing the names publicly or telling people they may possibly have been hacked. LulzSec said that by releasing lists of hacked usernames or informing the public of vulnerable websites, it gave users the opportunity to change names and passwords elsewhere that might otherwise have been exploited, and businesses would be alarmed and would upgrade their security.|$|E

2500|$|The pro-peace {{attitude}} {{of the people of}} the Soviet Union and People's China is not based on fear of war but on confidence in their theory and way of life.

We know that we can take it. <b>Just</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have been through it and suffered from it, we know how terrible war is. It wastes materials, but worse than that, it squanders human idealism, energy, wealth and life. Still worse, those of us who are trying to build a socialist society are diverted and preoccupied by war. We know from bitter experience that if we are to engage in socialist construction we cannot fight wars. War is a full-time occupation." ...|$|E

Warwickshire captain, Nick Knight, said, [...] "Once they were bowled out for 198 on that pitch {{they were always}} going to struggle. They then put down three catches, which proved to be decisive. We {{had a bit of}} luck so {{we are not going to}} start going around saying that we are going to win the Championship <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have won one match." [...] John Derrick, Glamorgan's coach, said, [...] "Although we batted much better second time around, we made it difficult for ourselves by not scoring enough first innings runs. Warwickshire showed what playing pressure cricket is all about. They bowled with a lot of discipline. They piled up a big score to make sure that we did not get back into the game." ...|$|E
30|$|In Table  2, {{we report}} {{the results of}} the {{estimated}} models with trade openness operationalized as trade volume. In this case, the number of countries is <b>just</b> 80 <b>because</b> <b>we</b> use total factor productivity instead of labor productivity. We did not report the results with the sample of 101 countries when trade openness (operationalized either by trade volume or import penetration ratio) is combined with labor productivity, which are similar to those obtained in Table  1, because the Pesaran (2004) test indicates that both the CCE and AMG estimators do not eliminate the problem of cross-sectional dependence with this sample. In models 1 and 2, trade openness has again a negative and statistically significant effect on the REER.|$|R

2500|$|From 1891 to 1900, Everhard {{served as}} {{president}} of the Ohio Suffrage Association. In 1894, she led the successful effort to secure school suffrage for Ohio women. She also gained for Ohio women the right to vote in municipal elections. She was among the suffrage activists who spoke at a hearing of the House judiciary committee in Washington D. C. in 1896, led by Susan B. Anthony. Everhard's remarks gave her reasons for activism:You probably wonder, even if you have not asked, why we are not at home looking after our families instead of coming to Washington to pester you. It is <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> want to take better care of our homes that we have come. I for one pay enough in taxes every year to buy a farm and yet I have no right to say how they shall be collected or how expended. It is a mistake to say that women do not want the ballot, for in Ohio, where we have been given school suffrage, interest has grown rapidly, and now women who at first did not even want school suffrage have been educated into being full-fledged suffragists." ...|$|E

She grew accustomed to influence from Southern rock bands, which include The Allman Brothers, Eagles, as well as country rock artists such as Emmylou Harris, Elvis Presley, and James Taylor. Yearwood stated that her primary musical influence is Linda Ronstadt, whom Yearwood had often been identified and compared within her albums. Yearwood says, [...] "She had a power and an emotion in her voice that made you believe every word she sang. My favorite song was probably 'Love Has No Pride,' but I listened to everything over and over. I knew the albums so well I knew which song it was from the first note." [...] She had recorded some of Ronstadt's compositions, including [...] "Try Me Again" [...] for her 2000 album, Real Live Woman. Yearwood said that she has never considered herself as a songwriter, but is precise about choosing songs that she can relate to. She stated, [...] "I always select music based on emotion, how it makes me feel, even before I made records. My producer, Garth Fundis, and I have to catch ourselves if we begin to think about recording a song we don't believe in <b>just</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> think it might be a hit."
