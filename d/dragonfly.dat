5|$|As {{support for}} {{multiple}} instruction set architectures complicates symmetric multiprocessing (SMP) support, <b>DragonFly</b> BSD now limits its {{support to the}} x86-64 platform. <b>DragonFly</b> originally ran on the x86 architecture, however as of version 4.0 {{it is no longer}} supported. Since version 1.10, <b>DragonFly</b> supports 1:1 userland threading (one kernel thread per userland thread), which is regarded as a relatively simple solution that is also easy to maintain. Inherited from FreeBSD, <b>DragonFly</b> also supports multi-threading.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{derivative}} of FreeBSD, <b>DragonFly</b> has inherited an easy-to-use integrated build {{system that can}} rebuild the entire base system from source {{with only a few}} commands. The <b>DragonFly</b> developers use the Git version control system to manage changes to the <b>DragonFly</b> source code. Unlike its parent FreeBSD, <b>DragonFly</b> has both stable and unstable releases in a single source tree, due to a smaller developer base.|$|E
5|$|As a {{seasonal}} symbol in Japan, the <b>dragonfly</b> {{is associated with}} autumn.|$|E
50|$|When {{you are at}} Weed Lake {{during the}} summer months, {{you might be able}} to find a few <b>dragonflies.</b> <b>Dragonflies</b> are some times can be blue or green or brown with clear wings. <b>Dragonflies</b> live off {{mosquitoes}} and flies. <b>Dragonflies</b> can be 1.9-13 cm. They are usually found near fresh water. This insect can live up to 3 weeks or 6 month if the weather is dry and it is warm. Its life cycle includes the stages; eggs, nymph and adult. <b>Dragonflies</b> lived 300 million years ago. Grown <b>dragonflies</b> are master fliers.|$|R
50|$|The insect family Aeshnidae, {{sometimes}} called aeshnids, comprises the hawkers (or darners in North America). They {{are the largest}} <b>dragonflies</b> found in North America and Europe and are among the largest <b>dragonflies</b> on the planet. This family represents also the fastest flying <b>dragonflies</b> {{of the order of}} the <b>dragonflies</b> and damselflies (Odonata).|$|R
30|$|The static {{behavior}} of <b>dragonflies,</b> i.e, looking for food {{can be treated}} as exploitation phase and evade from enemies can be treated as exploration phase. The static swarm <b>dragonflies</b> consist of small group of <b>dragonflies</b> which are hunting the preys in small space. The direction and velocity of this <b>dragonflies</b> are small and abrupt changes will {{be there in the}} direction. Dynamic swarm with constant direction and more number of different <b>dragonflies</b> moves to another place over a long distance.|$|R
5|$|<b>DragonFly</b> BSD is a {{free and}} open source Unix-like {{operating}} system created as a fork of FreeBSD 4.8. Matthew Dillon, an Amiga developer in the late 1980s and early 1990s and a FreeBSD developer between 1994 and 2003, began work on <b>DragonFly</b> BSD in June 2003 and announced it on the FreeBSD mailing lists on 16 July 2003.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dragonfly</b> nymphs {{are usually}} a well-camouflaged blend of dull brown, green, and grey.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} run safely on {{multiprocessor}} machines, access to shared resources (like files, data structures) must be serialized so that threads or processes do {{not attempt to}} modify the same resource at the same time. In order to prevent multiple threads from accessing or modifying a shared resource simultaneously, <b>DragonFly</b> employs critical sections, and serializing tokens to prevent concurrent access. While both Linux and FreeBSD 5 employ fine-grained mutex models to achieve higher performance on multiprocessor systems, <b>DragonFly</b> does not. Until recently, <b>DragonFly</b> also employed spls, but these were replaced with critical sections.|$|E
50|$|Dromaeschna is a genus of <b>dragonflies</b> in {{the family}} Telephlebiidae.Species of Dromaeschna are large <b>dragonflies</b> endemic to {{north-eastern}} Australia.|$|R

50|$|Pinheyschna is the {{scientific}} {{name of a}} genus of <b>dragonflies</b> from the family Aeshnidae. These relatively large <b>dragonflies</b> are also known as hawkers.|$|R
5|$|A blue-glazed faience <b>dragonfly</b> amulet {{was found}} by Flinders Petrie at Lahun, from the Late Middle Kingdom of ancient Egypt.|$|E
5|$|Alongside the Unix File System, {{which is}} {{typically}} the default file system on BSDs, <b>DragonFly</b> BSD supports HAMMER file system. It was developed specifically for <b>DragonFly</b> BSD {{to provide a}} feature-rich yet better designed analogue of the increasingly popular ZFS. HAMMER supports configurable file system history, snapshots, checksumming, data deduplication and other features typical for file systems of its kind.|$|E
5|$|Dillon started <b>DragonFly</b> in {{the belief}} that the methods and {{techniques}} being adopted for threading and symmetric multiprocessing in FreeBSD 5 would lead to poor system performance and cause maintenance difficulties. He sought to correct these suspected problems within the FreeBSD project. Due to ongoing conflicts with other FreeBSD developers over the implementation of his ideas, his ability to directly change the FreeBSD codebase was eventually revoked. Despite this, the <b>DragonFly</b> BSD and FreeBSD projects still work together contributing bug fixes, driver updates, and other system improvements to each other.|$|E
50|$|Aeshna is a genus of <b>dragonflies</b> {{from the}} family Aeshnidae. They are also known as hawker <b>dragonflies,</b> or, in North America, as mosaic darners.|$|R
50|$|Pseudocordulia {{is a small}} genus of <b>dragonflies</b> {{belonging}} to the family Pseudocorduliidae.They are medium-sized, bronze-black <b>dragonflies</b> with clear wings, endemic to tropical north-eastern Australia.|$|R
50|$|Austropetalia is a genus of <b>dragonflies</b> in {{the family}} Austropetaliidae, endemic to {{south-eastern}} Australia.Species of Austropetalia are medium-sized to large <b>dragonflies</b> with brown and yellow markings.|$|R
5|$|Like {{the other}} free open source BSDs, <b>DragonFly</b> is {{distributed}} {{under the terms}} of the modern version of the BSD license.|$|E
5|$|Many dragonflies, {{particularly}} males, are territorial. Some {{defend a}} territory against others {{of their own}} species, some against other species of <b>dragonfly</b> and a few against insects in unrelated groups. A particular perch may give a <b>dragonfly</b> a good view over an insect-rich feeding ground, and the blue dasher (Pachydiplax longipennis) jostles other dragonflies to maintain the right to alight there.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{implementation}} of Common Address Redundancy Protocol (commonly {{referred to as}} CARP) was finished in March 2007. As of 2011, CARP support is integrated into <b>DragonFly</b> BSD.|$|E
50|$|Archaeosynthemis is a genus of <b>dragonflies</b> in {{the family}} Synthemistidae, They are found across {{southern}} Australia and Fiji.They are medium-sized <b>dragonflies</b> with black and yellow markings.|$|R
50|$|Micromidia is a genus of <b>dragonflies</b> in {{the family}} Austrocorduliidae.They are small to {{medium-sized}} <b>dragonflies,</b> coloured black or metallic green with pale markings, and endemic to eastern Australia.|$|R
50|$|Male {{homosexuality}} {{has been}} inferred in {{several species of}} <b>dragonflies</b> (the order Odonata). The cloacal pinchers of male damselflies and <b>dragonflies</b> inflict characteristic head damage to females during sex. A survey of 11 species of damsel and <b>dragonflies</b> has revealed such mating damages in 20 to 80% of the males too, indicating a fairly high occurrence of sexual coupling between males.|$|R
5|$|Third-party {{software}} {{is available on}} <b>DragonFly</b> as binary packages via pkgng or from a native ports collection – DPorts.|$|E
5|$|Two-spotted <b>Dragonfly</b> Epitheca bimaculata was {{reported}} from Leicestershire in 2002 – see Parr (2003).|$|E
5|$|Although dragonflies are {{swift and}} agile fliers, some predators are {{fast enough to}} catch them. These include falcons such as the American kestrel, the merlin, and the hobby; nighthawks, swifts, flycatchers and {{swallows}} also take some adults; some species of wasps, too, prey on dragonflies, using them to provision their nests, laying an egg on each captured insect. In the water, various species of ducks and herons eat <b>dragonfly</b> larvae and they are also preyed on by newts, frogs, fish, and water spiders. Amur falcons, which migrate over the Indian Ocean at a period that coincides with the migration of the globe skimmer <b>dragonfly,</b> Pantala flavescens, may actually be feeding on them while on the wing.|$|E
50|$|Williamsonia is a genus {{of small}} <b>dragonflies</b> {{in the family}} Corduliidae. They are {{commonly}} known as boghaunters. Unlike other genera of emerald <b>dragonflies,</b> they have dark eyes and nonmetallic bodies.|$|R
50|$|Choristhemis is a genus {{of small}} <b>dragonflies</b> {{in the family}} Synthemistidae found in eastern Australia.They are small to {{medium-sized}} slender <b>dragonflies</b> with dark colouring and light markings and a relatively weak flight.|$|R
50|$|Austrogomphus is a genus of <b>dragonflies</b> in {{the family}} Gomphidae, endemic to Australia.Species of Austrogomphus are tiny to {{medium-sized}} <b>dragonflies,</b> black in colour with yellowish markings. They {{are commonly known as}} hunters.|$|R
5|$|<b>DragonFly</b> {{switched}} to multiprocessor safe slab allocator, which requires neither mutexes nor blocking operations for memory assignment tasks. It was eventually ported into standard C library in the userland, where it replaced FreeBSD's malloc implementation.|$|E
5|$|Dragonflies are {{affected}} by three major groups of parasites: water mites, gregarine protozoa, and trematode flatworms (flukes). Water mites, Hydracarina, can kill smaller <b>dragonfly</b> larvae, and may also be seen on adults. Gregarines infect the gut and may cause blockage and secondary infection. Trematodes are parasites of vertebrates such as frogs, with complex life cycles often involving a period as a stage called a cercaria in a secondary host, a snail. <b>Dragonfly</b> nymphs may swallow cercariae, or these may tunnel through a nymph's body wall; they then enter the gut and form a cyst or metacercaria, which remains in the nymph {{for the whole of}} its development. If the nymph is eaten by a frog, the amphibian becomes infected by the adult or fluke stage of the trematode.|$|E
5|$|Intended to be {{the logical}} {{continuation}} of the FreeBSD 4.x series, DragonFly's development has diverged significantly from FreeBSD's, including a new Light Weight Kernel Threads (LWKT) implementation, a lightweight ports/messaging system, and feature-rich HAMMER file system. Many concepts planned for <b>DragonFly</b> were inspired by the AmigaOS operating system.|$|E
500|$|Old and {{unreliable}} {{claims are}} made that <b>dragonflies</b> {{such as the}} southern giant darner can fly up to [...] However, the greatest reliable flight speed records are for other types of insects. In general, large <b>dragonflies</b> like the hawkers have a maximum speed of [...] with average cruising speed of about [...] <b>Dragonflies</b> can fly at 100 body-lengths per second, and three lengths per second backwards.|$|R
500|$|In Europe, <b>dragonflies</b> {{have often}} been seen as sinister. Some English vernacular names, such as [...] "horse-stinger", [...] "devil's darning needle", and [...] "ear cutter", link them with evil or injury. Swedish {{folklore}} holds that the devil uses <b>dragonflies</b> to weigh people's souls. The Norwegian name for <b>dragonflies</b> is Øyenstikker ("eye-poker"), and in Portugal, they are sometimes called tira-olhos ("eyes-snatcher"). They are often associated with snakes, as in the Welsh name gwas-y-neidr, [...] "adder's servant". The Southern United States term [...] "snake doctor" [...] refers to a folk belief that <b>dragonflies</b> follow snakes around and stitch them back together if they are injured.|$|R
50|$|Erythemis is a genus of <b>dragonflies</b> in the Libellulidae family, {{commonly}} known as Pondhawks. These medium- to large-sized skimmers are voracious predators of other insects up to their own size, including other <b>dragonflies.</b>|$|R
