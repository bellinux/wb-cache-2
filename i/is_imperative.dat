5|$|It is well {{understood}} that, {{at the moment}} {{it is only a}} minimum, the Society is always free to put in place the number of trains necessary to transport passengers who present themselves, that if it will satisfy this requirement, its proper interest is guaranteed, and, in giving greater public satisfaction, its infrastructure will be wisely used, instead of it travelling empty for part of the day to the detriment of its business. Being given the lower frequency of service on weekdays and Saturdays, except Thursdays (racing), we can perfectly accept the reduction to ten trips to those going from the racecourse to the forest, but, concerning the part of the journey from Trianon to the racecourse, it <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> that the Chief Engineer (Lechelas) keeps the minimum to 30, otherwise there will be a kind of abandonment of the line, because for this small distance, it will not be possible to get reasonable traffic with more frequent departures.|$|E

5|$|Parents {{are assumed}} to have the child's best {{interests}} in mind. Ethically, it <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> that the medical practitioner informs the parents about the benefits and risks of the procedure and obtain informed consent before performing it. Practically, however, many parents {{come to a decision}} about circumcising the child before he is born, and a discussion of the benefits and risks of the procedure with a physician has not been shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the decision. Some parents request to have their newborn or older child circumcised for non-therapeutic reasons, such as the parents' desires to adhere to family tradition, cultural norms or religious beliefs. In considering such a request, the physician may consider (in addition to any potential medical benefits and harms) such non-medical factors in determining the child's best interests and may ethically perform the procedure. Equally, without a clear medical benefit relative to the potential harms, a physician may take the ethical position that non-medical factors do not contribute enough as benefits to outweigh the potential harms and refuse to perform the procedure. Medical organization such as the British Medical Association state that their member physicians are not obliged to perform the procedure in such situations.|$|E
5|$|That night workers put the flukeman into a U.S. Marshal's van unrestrained, but {{it kills}} {{the driver and}} escapes to a local campsite. The flukeman hides in a {{portable}} toilet and is suctioned into a truck's tank {{the next day when}} the toilet is drained. Mulder receives another phone call from the mysterious caller telling him that success on his current work <b>is</b> <b>imperative</b> so that the X-Files be reinstated undeniably. When he questions Scully about it, she denies any involvement. The flukeman is brought back to the processing plant. Scully believes that the flukeworm she found in the body is a larva, attempting to reproduce. One of the men at the processing plant is pulled underwater by the flukeman while investigating a storm drain overflow. Mulder heads in and saves him, apparently killing the flukeman by closing a sewer grate on it, slicing it in half. Scully concludes her investigation, thinking that the creature was brought to the U.S. by a Russian freighter that was hauling salvage material from Chernobyl, and that the creature was created in a 'soup' of radioactive sewage. Elsewhere, the flukeman's remains open its eyes.|$|E

Rousseau is, however, reluctant to engage this discussion in depth.|$|E

This means that one must calculate the constant so that a recalculation of the formula would predict exactly the same refractive error as actually observed.|$|E
