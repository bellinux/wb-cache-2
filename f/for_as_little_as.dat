Cincinnati fans had bought 13,000 tickets, while Virginia Tech fans bought fewer than 5,000 tickets from the school's allotment. Countering Virginia Tech's low direct ticket sales were {{large numbers of}} fans who avoided paying face value for tickets—US$125—by buying them on the secondary market, often <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 99 cents.|$|E

While there was agreement {{on how to handle}} the foreign debt (especially with France), there was not with regards to the national debt held by domestic creditors. During the Revolutionary War, affluent citizens had invested in bonds, and war veterans had been paid with promissory notes and IOUs that plummeted in price during the Confederation. In response, the war veterans sold the securities to speculators <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> fifteen to twenty cents on the dollar.|$|E

Before spring arrived, Wickersham published the first {{newspaper in the}} settlement—the Fairbanks Miner—on a typewriter. It sold seven copies at $5 per copy. But even as the walls of Wickersham's courthouse were going up, dissatisfied miners were leaving the area. Hundreds left on rafts going downriver or steamers going to Dawson City. By June 1903, cabins on city lots were selling <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> $10. Meanwhile, Barnette sold two-thirds of his store to the Alaska Commercial Company and arranged {{for the establishment of}} a post office at his settlement.|$|E
5|$|Octopuses have a {{relatively}} short life expectancy; some species live <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> six months. The giant Pacific octopus, {{one of the two}} largest species of octopus, may live for as much as five years. Octopus lifespan is limited by reproduction: males can live for only a few months after mating, and females die shortly after their eggs hatch. Octopus reproductive organs mature due to the hormonal influence of the optic gland but result in the inactivation of their digestive glands, typically causing the octopus to eventually die from starvation. Experimental removal of both optic glands after spawning was found to result in the cessation of broodiness, the resumption of feeding, increased growth, and greatly extended lifespans.|$|E
5|$|Rolling {{stock on}} the New York City Subway {{produces}} {{high levels of}} noise that exceed guidelines set by the World Health Organization and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. In 2006, Columbia University's Mailman School of Public Health found noise levels averaged 95 decibel (dB) inside subway cars and 94dB on platforms. Daily exposure to noise at such levels <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> 30 minutes can lead to hearing loss. Noise on one in 10 platforms exceeded 100dB. Under WHO and EPA guidelines, noise exposure at that level is limited to 1.5 minutes. A subsequent study by Columbia and the University of Washington found higher average noise levels in the subway (80.4dB) than on commuter trains including Port Authority Trans-Hudson (PATH) (79.4dB), Metro-North (75.1dB) and Long Island Rail Road (LIRR) (74.9dB). Since the decibel scale is a logarithmic scale, sound at 95dB is 10 times more intense than at 85dB, 100 times more intense than at 75dB, and so forth. In the second study, peak subway noise registered at 102.1dB.|$|E

For these reasons, the stealing of food was severely punished and a person could be shot <b>for</b> <b>as</b> <b>little</b> <b>as</b> stealing a loaf of bread. More serious crimes, such as murder and cannibalism, also occurred, and special police squads were set up to combat these crimes, though {{by the end of the}} siege, roughly 1,500 had been arrested for cannibalism.|$|E
