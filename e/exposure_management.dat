Whilst a CVA platform {{is based on an}} exposure measurement platform, the requirements of an active CVA desk differ from those of a Risk Control group and {{it is not uncommon to}} see institutions use different systems for risk <b>exposure</b> <b>management</b> on one hand and CVA pricing and hedging on the other.|$|E
40|$|The {{increased}} {{volatility of}} international markets generates increased financial {{risk to the}} companies. Exchange rate change {{is one of the}} financial risks where the increased volatility is reflected to the greatest extent. Big multinational companies are particularly exposed to exchange rate fluctuation; therefore, special attention should be paid to exchange rate management. There are a lot of ways that exchange rate risk management analysis might be set. In our thesis, transaction exposure is our chosen method of analysis. Business transactions are what profit seeking companies' activity is based upon, and transaction <b>exposure</b> <b>management</b> is an activity that observes the whole life span of business transaction from `birth' to `death'. Thus, we stress, that such a whole period exposure analysis of the company's most fundamental activity would give the clearest picture of the topic. In our thesis, we investigate how theoretical transaction <b>exposure</b> <b>management</b> is executed in practice. We analyse the transaction <b>exposure</b> <b>management</b> of two multinational companies from different industrial clusters as a descriptive example. The results of the companies' transaction <b>exposure</b> <b>management</b> are compared. Our investigation has resulted in a set of interesting observations, together with transaction <b>exposure</b> <b>management</b> suggestions for the companies. Some of the observations give rise to more questions than answers, and it might, therefore, be a good starting point for further research in this field...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{examine the}} impact of {{treatment}} setting and <b>exposure</b> to case <b>management</b> services on {{the quality of life of}} U. S. veterans with chronic and persistent mental illness. DATA SOURCES/STUDY SETTING: Data were collected longitudinally on a panel of 895 clients enrolled in 14 pilot programs in Department of Veterans Affairs long-term psychiatric hospitals by the Serious Mental Illness Treatment Research and Evaluation Center during the period 1991 - 96. STUDY DESIGN: Data were collected using two primary survey instruments (clinician assessment and client assessment) at baseline, every six months for the first two years, and every year thereafter, for a total of four years of follow-up. Case <b>management</b> <b>exposure</b> over time and its impact on the client's quality of life represent the key variables in the study. Additional controls included a variety of sociodemographic, socioeconomic, and psychiatric characteristics. DATA COLLECTION/EXTRACTION METHODS: Hierarchical linear modeling was used to control for potential selection bias, test for the compositional effect of treatment setting, and examine {{the impact of}} case <b>management</b> <b>exposure</b> over time on the individual client's quality of life. PRINCIPAL FINDINGS: Increased <b>exposure</b> to case <b>management</b> results in an improved quality of life across several domains, including both objective and subjective dimensions for health, general, leisure, and social, and the subjective dimension only for housing. CONCLUSIONS: The study findings provide managers, clinicians, and policymakers a fuller understanding of how this mode of service delivery-case management-affects several domains of quality of life for clients with chronic illnesses...|$|R
40|$|Foreign {{currencies}} are {{an integral}} part of doing international business. Their role is often accepted as a necessity, while the significance of the risks associated with uncertain future exchange rates is dismissed. Previous studies have shown that actively managing foreign exchange (FX) exposure can be beneficial. Few studies, however, have comprehensively explored how to manage FX exposure. The purpose of this study is to examine the FX <b>exposure</b> <b>management</b> practices of non-financial companies involved in international business and ultimately to evaluate their practices. This study contributes to existing literature by outlining a framework for FX <b>exposure</b> <b>management.</b> Previous studies have been content to conclude FX management practices to vary significantly across companies, but this study asserts that sufficient similarities do exist for identifying common developmental paths. Identifying them enables evaluation and comparison of FX <b>exposure</b> <b>management</b> practices between companies. For managers the study includes a tool for self-evaluation and benchmarking purposes. The empirical part of the study gives an overview of the prevailing FX <b>exposure</b> <b>management</b> practices in Finnish non-financial companies. For the empirical part an online survey was conducted in between December 2010 and January 2011. 1110 Finnish non-financial companies were asked to participate out of which 86 applicable responses were received. This constituted overall a 7, 7 % response rate. The results of the survey study showed that company size, quantity of FX exposure and the number of foreign currencies used by a company in its operations have positive relationships with the sophistication of prevailing FX <b>exposure</b> <b>management</b> practices. Still the study found that there are significant variations in managing practices of companies with similar FX exposure profiles. Overall performance evaluation was the most neglected component of FX <b>exposure</b> <b>management...</b>|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{secondhand smoke}} (SHS) <b>exposure</b> and <b>management</b> {{in the context}} of smoking {{location}} restrictions, for nonsmokers, former, and current smokers. A purposive sample of 47 low income and non-low-income men and women of varied smoking statuses was recruited to participate in a telephone interview or a focus group. Amidst general approval of increased restrictions there were gendered patterns of SHS <b>exposure</b> and <b>management,</b> and effects of SHS policies that reflect power, control, and social roles that need to be considered as policies are developed, implemented and monitored. The experience of smoking restrictions and the management of SHS is influenced by the social context (relationship with a partner, family member, or stranger), the space of exposure (public or private, worksite), the social location of individuals involved (gender, income), and differential tolerance to SHS. This confluence of factors creates differing unintended and unexpected consequences to the social and physical situations of male and female smokers, nonsmokers, and former smokers. These factors deserve further study, in the interests of informing the development of future interventions and policies restricting SHS...|$|R

40|$|Reliable and {{consistent}} {{estimates of the}} sensitivity of stock returns to the changes in exchange rates (exchange rate exposure of stock returns) is an essential piece of information needed in exchange rate <b>exposure</b> <b>management</b> and government policy implementation towards financial markets in a country. Obtaining reliable estimates may be hindered by the negligence of the stylised facts associated with the exposure process. Existence of asymmetries in both stock returns and volatility of stock returns underlying exchange rate exposure are some of those stylised facts {{that seem to be}} seriously neglected in the current studies of exchange rate exposure. This paper analyses three types of asymmetries using a sample of 50 Japanese firms.

This study concerns the impact of IC on management accounting practices (MAP) and corporate performance. It examines whether, and how, the degree and form of IC influences MAP, specifically performance measurement, budgeting, capital budgeting, and economic <b>exposure</b> <b>management.</b> It explores the greater likelihood of firms investing heavily in IC emphasising non-financial measures and adopting a non-accounting style, focusing more on strategic, and less on financial issues.
