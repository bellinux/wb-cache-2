500|$|The narrator {{tells the}} reader that some thought Lucie had fallen asleep on the stile and dreamed the encounter, but if so, then <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> three clean {{handkerchiefs}} and a laundered pinafore? [...] "Besides," [...] the narrator assures the reader, [...] "I have seen that door {{into the back of}} the hill called Catbells – and besides I am very well acquainted with dear Mrs. Tiggy-winkle!" ...|$|E
60|$|She {{spoke from}} the instinctive wish of delaying shame; {{she spoke with}} a {{resolution}} which sprung from despair, for she spoke what <b>she</b> did not, <b>could</b> not believe herself. It had been the shock of conviction as she read. The truth rushed on her; and <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> spoken at all, <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> even <b>have</b> breathed, was afterwards matter of wonder to herself.|$|R
60|$|The {{note was}} written without pause or hesitation. It had been thought out {{before it was}} begun. It was strange, even to herself, how easily {{it had come to}} her, after having had it so much on her mind for the last month. She {{wondered}} now <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> hesitated so long; <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>have</b> doubted as to what she would say to him.|$|R
6000|$|She took {{a minute}} to answer. [...] "I am going to light these lamps," [...] said Hoopdriver. He bent down to his own, and struck a match on his shoe. She looked at his face in its light, grave and intent. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> ever <b>have</b> thought him common or absurd? ...|$|R
2500|$|Yates claimed that, {{despite his}} urging to check her medical records for prior treatment, Dr. Saeed {{had refused to}} {{continue}} her regimen of the antipsychotic Haldol, the treatment that had worked for her during her first breakdown in 1999."The real question to me is: <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> been so ill and the medical community not diagnose her, not treat her, and obviously not protect our family from her...Rusty testified that he never {{knew that she had}} visions and voices; he said he never knew she had considered killing the children. Neither did Dr. Saeed, even though the delusions could have been found in medical records from 1999 ... he reluctantly prescribed Haldol, the same drug that worked in a drug cocktail for her in 1999. But after a few weeks, he took her off the drug, citing his concerns about side effects ... though her condition seemed to be worsening two days before the drownings, when Rusty drove her to Dr. Saeed's office, he testified, the doctor refused to try Haldol longer or return her to the hospital" [...] He added that his wife was too sick to be discharged from her last stay in the hospital in May 2001. He said he noticed the staff lower their heads as if in shame and embarrassment, turning away without saying a word. The hospital had no other choice due to the ten-day psychiatric hospitalization insurance constraints of their provider, Blue Cross Blue Shield, subcontracted by Magellan Health Services.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yet," [...] {{rejoined the}} Baital impudently, [...] "if Tribikram had not {{preserved}} her bones <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> been restored to life? And if Madhusadan had not learned {{the science of}} restoring the dead to life <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> been revivified? At least, {{so it seems to}} me. But perhaps your royal wisdom may explain." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> {{married my}} father, {{who is not}} a gentleman and never could have {{impressed}} a lady with the notion he was one?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{accused me}} of knowing every thing, & reproached me for not having stopped the marriage. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> I! <b>She</b> <b>had</b> been shewn my letters, and every one else. It is utterly false that she ever opened the desk--the nurse {{had nothing to do}} with the separation-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] I said, [...] "but how {{can that}} be? You are an old man, and the time you talk of must reach back three men's lives. <b>How</b> {{therefore}} <b>could</b> <b>She</b> <b>have</b> ordered the death of anybody {{at the beginning of}} the life of your grandmother, seeing that herself <b>she</b> would not <b>have</b> been born?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>How?</b> What reason <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> {{to believe}} the Ammonite was a shell? It is not the least like cockles, or whelks, or any shell she ever saw.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pardon me, my father," [...] I {{interrupted}} at this point; [...] "but if, as I understand, 'She-who-must-be-obeyed' lives yet farther off, <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> {{known of}} our approach?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... (Now {{some people}} say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile--but then <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety-pin? ...|$|E
6000|$|Then she did {{not love}} him! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> pretended love, and raised him to such a {{pinnacle}} of hope only to cast him down to such utter depths of despair! ...|$|E
60|$|But where <b>could</b> <b>she</b> take refuge, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> go? <b>She</b> <b>had</b> never breathed her {{dread of}} him to any one but Helena. If she went to Helena, and told her what had passed, that very act might bring down the {{irreparable}} mischief that he threatened he had the power, and that <b>she</b> knew he <b>had</b> the will, to do. The more fearful he appeared to her excited memory and imagination, the more alarming her responsibility appeared; seeing that a slight mistake on her part, either in action or delay, might let his malevolence loose on Helena’s brother.|$|R
5000|$|In the present, Klaus enters Dagmar's {{window and}} confronts her, asking her <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> thought him guilty of {{poisoning}} her father, or <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> chosen Magnus over him. <b>She</b> <b>has</b> no answer, but {{he gives her}} a single toy for Jonas. At first, Jonas wants to smash it, but she sits down and encourages him {{to tell a story}} with it, and soon the two of them are playing happily, before Magnus interrupts them. He has a plan to trap [...] "the Santa", using Jonas to write a wish letter.|$|R
5000|$|Dick Hern {{called her}} [...] "a very, very good filly who never reached her {{potential}} because of injury ... nobody knows quite <b>how</b> good <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been." ...|$|R
6000|$|He bowed sadly {{and went}} out. Miss Madeline watched him guiltily {{as he walked}} across the lawn. He looked heart-broken. How dreadful it had been! And Lina had refused twelve men! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> lived through it? ...|$|E
6000|$|Percy [...] . Percy [...] . {{her husband}} [...] . the Scarlet Pimpernel [...] . Oh! <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> been so blind?

60|$|The next morning, Willy Croup, who {{had begun}} to regret that she had ever said {{anything}} about blankets,--but <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> imagined that anybody could be so cut up at what that old Shott woman had said?--brought Mrs. Cliff a letter.|$|E
6000|$|... "So far as {{the psychic}} was concerned, I don't see <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> had any hand in it," [...] said Miller. [...] "But, then, {{it was all in}} the dark." ...|$|R
60|$|Although {{with her}} infallible {{instinct}} Mrs. Small {{had said the}} very thing to make her guest 'more intriguee than ever,' {{it is difficult to}} see <b>how</b> else <b>she</b> <b>could</b> truthfully <b>have</b> spoken.|$|R
60|$|Looking at {{the matter}} in a {{charitable}} light, Nan consented, and went cheerfully on with her work, wondering <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> thought ironing an infliction, and been so ungrateful for the blessings of her lot.|$|R
6000|$|Still Nancy was silent, looking down; and {{he almost}} {{expected}} that she would presently get up and say {{she would go to}} her father's. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> any mercy for faults that must seem so black to her, with her simple, severe notions? ...|$|E
6000|$|He did not now {{quite know}} what to do. He {{certainly}} {{did not wish to}} impoverish the Church by marrying Miss Mackenzie without any fortune. But might it not all be a trick? That she had been rich he knew, and <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> become poor so quickly? ...|$|E
6000|$|REGINALD [out of patience] Whats {{the good}} of beating your wife unless theres a witness to prove it afterwards? You dont suppose a man beats his wife {{for the fun of}} it, do you? <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> got her divorce if I hadnt beaten her? Nice state of things, that! ...|$|E
6000|$|Indignation at the {{injustice}} of Fate in causing her to give her heart to a man and then changing him into another and quite different man fought with a cold terror, which grew as she realized more and more clearly {{the magnitude of the}} mistake <b>she</b> <b>had</b> made. <b>She</b> felt that she must escape. And yet <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> escape? <b>She</b> <b>had</b> definitely pledged herself to this man. ("Ah!" [...] cried Geoffrey gaily, as the pats of butter arrived. [...] "That's more like it!" [...] He began to smear the toast. Maud averted her eyes.) <b>She</b> <b>had</b> told him that she loved him, that he was the whole world to her, that there never would be anyone else. He had come to claim her. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> refuse him just because he was about thirty pounds overweight? ...|$|R
5000|$|Charo, {{who was a}} {{frequent}} television guest-star in the 1970s, presents ideas of <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been introduced into the cast of a popular show from the time period. Each idea includes some reference to her [...] "cuchi cuchi" [...] catchphrase.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I can't say I'm sorry," [...] said Marilla, who {{sometimes}} wondered <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> lived before Anne came to Green Gables, [...] "no, not exactly sorry. If you've finished your lessons, Anne, I {{want you to}} run over and ask Mrs. Barry if she'll lend me Diana's apron pattern." ...|$|R
6000|$|... (Now {{some people}} say that little Lucie had been asleep upon the stile-- but then <b>how</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> found three clean pocket-handkins and a pinny, pinned with a silver safety pin?

6000|$|As {{she walked}} to and fro the raging of her spirit changed its objective: from {{restraint}} to its final causes; and chief amongst them the pride which had been so grievously hurt. How she loathed the day that had passed, and how more than all she hated herself for her part in it; her mad, foolish, idiotic, self-importance which gave her the idea of such an act and urged her {{to the bitter end}} of its carrying out; her mulish obstinacy in persisting when every fibre of her being had revolted at the doing, and when deep in her inmost soul was a deterring sense of its futility. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> stooped to have done such a thing: to ask a man [...] . oh! the shame of it, the shame of it all! <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> been so blind as to think that such a man was worthy!

60|$|Bertha was troubled, {{and found}} herself embarrassed by the mulatto's services. She now {{perceived}} sadness beneath the quiet lines {{of his face and}} hard-won culture in the tones of his voice. The essential tragedy of his defeat grew more poignant to her as she watched him getting the trunks strapped, surrounded by maids and porters. <b>How</b> <b>could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> misread his manner? He was performing his duties, not with quiet gusto, but {{in the spirit of the}} trained nurse.|$|E
60|$|<b>Could</b> <b>she</b> <b>have</b> been at home, <b>she</b> might <b>have</b> been {{of service}} to every {{creature}} in the house. She felt that <b>she</b> must <b>have</b> been of use to all. To all <b>she</b> must <b>have</b> saved some trouble of head or hand; and were it only in supporting the spirits of her aunt Bertram, keeping her from the evil of solitude, or the still greater evil of a restless, officious companion, too apt to be heightening danger {{in order to enhance}} her own importance, her being {{there would have been a}} general good. She loved to fancy <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> read to her aunt, <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> talked to her, and tried at once to make her feel the blessing of what was, and prepare her mind for what might be; and how many walks up and down stairs <b>she</b> might <b>have</b> saved her, and how many messages <b>she</b> might <b>have</b> carried.|$|R
60|$|And {{of course}} <b>she</b> <b>had</b> got her way. Could he resist her in anything? They {{had never spoken}} of it since, {{it was such a}} sad little ring. Sad! It was not in the least little bit sad. Grizel {{wondered}} as she looked at it now <b>how</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> ever <b>have</b> thought it sad.|$|R
60|$|<b>How</b> <b>she</b> <b>could</b> <b>have</b> been so deceived!--He {{protested that}} he had never thought seriously of Harriet--never! She looked back as well as she could; but it was all confusion. <b>She</b> <b>had</b> taken up the idea, she supposed, and made every thing bend to it. His manners, however, must have been unmarked, wavering, dubious, or <b>she</b> <b>could</b> not <b>have</b> been so misled.|$|R
