Justice Anthony Kennedy, Justice Clarence Thomas, Justice Stephen Breyer, Justice Samuel Alito, and Justice Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion (however, Justice Thomas did not join as to Part II-C of the opinion).|$|E
5|$|Under {{administrative}} law, {{judicial review}} <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> {{in which the}} High Court scrutinizes the executive's decisions and orders {{to ensure that they}} conform with the law. If the decisions and orders are not authorized by statute or if they have been made in contravention of administrative law principles, the Court can invalidate them. Similarly, if any exercise of power by an executive body contravenes the Constitution, the Court has a duty to declare it invalid. With regards to the ISA and the powers to detain without trial, the scope of judicial review was subject to a succession of changes between 1988 and 1990. These changes revolved around the issue of whether the discretion of the President and the Home Affairs Minister should be assessed objectively or subjectively. During that period, the scope of judicial review was expanded by common law developments but was subsequently curtailed by legislative and constitutional amendments.|$|E

This practice started in Milan in the 1530s and 1540s by Capuchins such as Giuseppe da Fermo who promoted long periods of adoration. From Northern Italy it was carried to elsewhere in Europe by the Capuchins and Jesuits.|$|E
25|$|Like intuitionism, constructivism {{involves}} the regulative principle that only mathematical entities {{which can be}} explicitly constructed {{in a certain sense}} should be admitted to mathematical discourse. In this view, mathematics <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> of the human intuition, not a game played with meaningless symbols. Instead, it is about entities that we can create directly through mental activity. In addition, some adherents of these schools reject non-constructive proofs, such as a proof by contradiction.|$|E
25|$|A special {{aspect of}} the High Court's {{original}} jurisdiction is its judicial review jurisdiction. This jurisdiction is implied rather than expressly stated in any statute. The Court exercises two types of judicial review: judicial review under the Constitution of Singapore, and judicial review of administrative acts. However, only the first type <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> of the Court's judicial review jurisdiction, as judicial review of administrative acts is regarded as falling within the Court's supervisory jurisdiction (see below).|$|E

25|$|There {{are three}} ways a {{case can be}} heard in the Supreme Court: (1) filing {{directly}} in the Supreme Court; (2) filing in a lower federal court, such as a district court, and appealing {{all the way up to}} the Supreme Court; (3) filing in a state court, appealing all the way up through the state's highest courts, and then appealing to the Supreme Court on an issue of federal law. The first <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> of the Court's original jurisdiction; the second and third are exercises of the Supreme Court's appellate jurisdiction.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, {{because of}} the unlikelihood that Shakespeare would have had {{direct access to the}} Greek text of Plutarch's Parallel Lives and {{probably}} read it through a French translation from a Latin translation, his play constructs Romans with an anachronistic Christian sensibility that might have been influenced by St. Augustine's Confessions among others. As Miles writes, the ancient world would not have been aware of interiority and the contingence of salvation upon conscience until Augustine. For the Christian world, salvation relied on and belonged to the individual, while the Roman world viewed salvation as political. So, Shakespeare's characters in Antony and Cleopatra, particularly Cleopatra in her belief that her own suicide <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> of agency, exhibit a Christian understanding of salvation.|$|E
25|$|Many regiments of the Canadian Army {{have also}} been granted {{the use of the}} prefix royal in the regiment's name, while others bear the name of a member of the Royal Family. The royal prefix—termed a royal designation—is an honour that {{demonstrates}} royal favour for the organisation to whose name the prefix is applied. Its award <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> of the Royal Prerogative and it does not expire unless revoked by the Crown-in-Council or the organisation that received the designation ceases to exist. If the name of the regiment should change after the prefix is granted, the word royal may be retained preceding the new name, such as when the Royal Northwest Mounted Police was renamed in 1920 as the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.|$|E

[...] The court noted that this was not limited to reporters and journalists, but a right of all citizens, subject to reasonable limitations of time, place and manner.

500|$|Time {{ranked the}} album number nine, with the publication's Claire Suddath writing that [...] "It's {{an amalgam of}} beats, chants and raps mixed {{together}} with exacting precision. Big Boi deftly jumps between musical styles [...] and his raps come so fast, he seems to never pause for breath". Pitchfork Media named it the fourth best album of 2010 and stated [...] "he sound of Sir Lucious Left Foot <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> in recognizing traditions and pushing them miles ahead. Big Boi crowns it all with a lyrical acumen so detailed and charismatic—acting as benevolent hustler, knuckle-dusting elder statesman, trickster smartass and street-level philosopher". It was voted the sixth-best album in The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 2010, while 11 songs from the album {{were included in the}} poll's singles list, including [...] "Shutterbugg" [...] (number seven), [...] "Shine Blockas" [...] (number 95), and [...] "Follow Us" [...] (number 316).

500|$|In {{the late}} 1970s Tippett {{produced}} three single-movement instrumental works: the Symphony No. 4 (1977), the String Quartet No. 4 (1978), and the Triple Concerto for violin, viola and cello (1979). [...] The symphony, {{written in the}} manner of the tone poem or symphonic fantasia exemplified by Sibelius, represents what Tippett describes as a birth-to-death cycle, beginning and ending with the sounds of breathing. This effect was initially provided by a wind machine, although other means have been tried, with mixed results—according to Bowen [...] "the sounds emitted can turn out to be redolent of a space-fiction film or a bordello". [...] The Fourth String Quartet, Tippett explains, <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> in [...] "finding a sound" [...] that he first encountered in the incidental music to a television programme on Rembrandt. In the Triple Concerto, which is thematically related to the Fourth Quartet and quotes from it, the three solo instruments [...] perform individually rather than as a formal grouping. The work acknowledges Tippett's past with quotations from The Midsummer Marriage.|$|E
500|$|However, some reviewers {{felt the}} film relied {{too heavily on}} gadgets and special effects, with the plot being neglected. James Berardinelli of Reelviews.net said, [...] "This is a train wreck of an action film – a stupefying attempt by the filmmakers to {{force-feed}} James Bond into the mindless XXX mold and throw 40 years of cinematic history down the toilet in favor of bright flashes and loud bangs." [...] Of the action sequences, he said, [...] "Die Another Day <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>exercise</b> in loud explosions and excruciatingly bad special effects. The CGI work in this movie is {{an order of magnitude}} worse than anything I have seen in a major motion picture. Coupled with lousy production design, Die Another Day looks like it was done on the cheap. Gary Brown of the Houston Community Newspapers also described the weak point of the film as [...] "the seemingly non-stop action sequences and loud explosions that appear to take centre stage while the Bond character is almost relegated to second string." [...] Roger Moore remarked, [...] "I thought it just went too far – and that’s from me, the first Bond in space! Invisible cars and dodgy CGI footage? Please!" ...|$|E
