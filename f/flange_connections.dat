A contact correction approach is proposed to simulate the loading of the bolt connection under the condition of pre-stressing.

Stiffener pull-off tests revealed that the ultimate failure load and absorbed energy capacity of the skin-to-stiffener <b>flange</b> <b>connection</b> to the panels increased rapidly with the volume content of z-pins due to suppression of bond-line cracking.

40|$|Process {{safety is}} a task of {{preventing}} leaks. Leak prevention is critical because pressure vessels and piping assets in chemical plants are fabricated from materials which have limited corrosion resistance. When corrosive compounds are processed in these assets, they may suffer degradation over time due to thinning, cracking, or loss of their material properties. This problem is partially controlled by applying a safety margin known called a corrosion allowance. The corrosion allowance is determined by predicting the asset?s expected corrosion rate and its service life. However, this fixed safety margin does not consider the inherent uncertainty in an individual asset?s degradation rate due to variability in the material?s corrosion resistance, the operating parameters of the process, and the inspection techniques {{used to measure the}} progression of corrosion damage over time. Consequently, deterministic analysis is not capable of precisely estimating an asset?s safe operating life during its design stage. One of the most likely areas for leakage to occur in process equipment is at the <b>flange</b> <b>connections</b> that join assets together. Risk analyses for planning inspections of fixed equipment and piping usually treat flanges as components of their parent asset. This thesis focuses on methods to improve prediction and control of corrosion and leakage at <b>flange</b> <b>connections</b> in particular. Flange connection seal tightness can be monitored through vibration-based Non-Destruction Testing (NDT). The data gathered from this monitoring can be used to update risk models for flange connection leakage. Hierarchical Bayesian Network methods of modeling risk are demonstrated in this thesis to be capable of predicting probability of seal failure based on the mean and variance of failure rates in a population of <b>flange</b> <b>connections.</b> This allows for prediction of the probabilities based on corrosion and leak events in the plant. The results of inspection techniques are used as inputs to this risk model, enabling probabilistic decision-making...|$|E

It is important to investigate the sealing performance of pipe connections under long term severe thermal exposure swings to ensure operational safety. In this study, the effects of cyclic thermal conditions on the sealing performance and mechanical characteristics in larger and smaller nominal diameter of pipe flange connection are examined using FEM calculations. Helium gas leakage is predicted using the contact gasket stress obtained from the FEM results. On other hand, the leakage tests using the smaller nominal diameter of pipe flange connection were conducted to measure the amount of helium gas leakage and to compare with the predicted amount of gas leakage. As the results, the contact gasket stress distributions were changed dramatically under cyclic thermal condition and elevated internal pressure. In the pipe <b>flange</b> <b>connections</b> with smaller nominal diameter, the contact gasket stress was the smallest in the restart condition.

40|$|Connection is an {{important}} element in structural steelwork construction. Eurocode does not provide adequate design information for mechanical properties prediction of top-seat <b>flange</b> cleat <b>connection,</b> especially for thin-walled cold-formed steel structures. Adopting hot-rolled design with neglecting thin-walled behaviour could lead to unsafe or uneconomic design. This research aims to provide accurate mechanical properties prediction for bolted top-seat <b>flange</b> cleat <b>connection</b> in cold-formed steel structures. The scope of work focuses on the effect of various thickness of the flange cleat to the rotational stiffness and strength behaviour of a beam-to-column connection.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper, the gasket stress distributions, hub stress and a {{variation}} in axial bolt force in bolted gasketed pipe <b>flange</b> <b>connections</b> under internal pressure are analyzed using elasto-plastic FEM {{taking into account}} the nonlinearity of gasket behavior. Non-asbestos spiral wound gaskets were employed. The effect of nominal flange diameter is examined on the gasket contact stress distributions, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force (the load factor) is examined. Using the obtained gasket contact stress distribution and the fundamental data of the relationship between gasket compressive stress and gasket leak rate according to JIS B 2490, a method for predicting the leak rate is demonstrated. Experiments to measure the amount of leakage, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force when the joint is under internal pressure were carried out. The numerical results of the leak rate, hub stress and the load factor are in a fairly good agreement with the measured results. Then, a method is demonstrated for determining the bolt preload under given conditions, that is, taking into account assembly efficiency, leak rate and internal pressure In addition, bolt preload is determined using the actual gasket contact stress which can be estimated using the value of the load factor.

A RFCS (research fund for coal and steel) research project called HISTWIN has the aim to improve the competitiveness of the windmill towers made of steel. The towers for high power wind generators often consist of several cylindrical slightly tapered steel segments connected by bolted flanges. This is a traditional and well established solution. One {{part of the project}} is to examine if a friction connection can be used instead of the traditional <b>flange</b> <b>connection,</b> because the friction connection will introduce two mprovements: it is expected to have higher fatigue class, leading to less steel consumption and the tower will be faster to assemble. The proposed friction connection is a lap connection bolted with tension control bolts, TC-bolts. One plate of the connection has normal sized holes while the other plate has long open slots. This solution is expected to reduce the total cost of the tower with at least 10 %. The main objective of this report is to establish structural characteristics of static behavior and the ks factor for this type of connection according to Eurocode and to investigate the performance of TC-bolts in the connection. The ks factor is a factor that reduces the slip resistance for friction connections in EN 1993 - Part 1 - 8 regarding size of holes used in the connection. There are no specific rules for long open slots in EN 1993 - Part 1 - 8 which are used in the proposed connection. Another aim of this report is to evaluate different ways to control the preload. The objective is to evaluate properties of TC-bolts and its competitiveness. The ks factor is evaluated from four groups of specimens. The tested specimens have two types of surfaces and have three different configurations of bolt placement in the specimens. Design of the tower connections are done with the experimentally obtained ks factor for a lap connection and comparison is made with an ordinary <b>flange</b> <b>connection.</b> The results in this report shows that the use of TC-bolts is a very competitive method to control the preload with respect to speed of installation, and that the bolts perform well under various conditions and treatments. The experiments done in this report shows that the proposed connection has a ks factor equal to 0, 75 as the connections are prevented from in-plane rotation, this can be compared with the ks factor for long slotted holes which is equal to 0, 63. Economical calculations show that if a lap connection with long open slots is used instead of an ordinary <b>flange</b> <b>connection,</b> the cost will be reduced by more than 85 % per connection in a wind tower. These calculations are done with respect to price of flanges and bolts provided by HISTWIN partners. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
