Inflorescence architecture also affects crop yield.

In all cases (whatever the treatment) flowers continued to appear within inflorescences during {{extended period of time}} and there was a drastic reduction of grain number relative to number of flowers formed. Examination of cumulative curves of development stages confmned clearly that this happened shortly after flowering whatever the moment of flowers appearance within the inflorescences. The low number of kernels was mainly due to early abortion of flower occurring just after flower opening. The treatments <b>of</b> suppression <b>of</b> <b>inflorescences</b> presented a better seed setting than the control treatment by reducing this early abortion rate, major factor of the general very low seed setting of buckwheat plants. Therefore, {{there was no significant difference}} for the final mean yield of brown kernels per plant between the plants with removal inflorescences and control plants, in spite of a smaller number <b>of</b> <b>inflorescences.</b> The plants submitted to removal <b>of</b> <b>inflorescences</b> compensated by reducing the abortion rate in the remaining inflorescences.

40|$|ABSTRACT Light {{is one of}} {{the factors}} that most affect crop growth and yield. However, the control of light {{intensity}} is difficult, because, under certain environmental conditions, light energy may exceed or limit the capacity of plants to use it. In this sense, the productive behavior of plant species in shaded environments needs to be known. This study aimed to evaluate the effect of different shaded environments with black shade nets [0 (full sun), 35 and 50 %, and overlap 35 + 50 % shading nets] on flowering, yield and quality <b>of</b> <b>inflorescences</b> <b>of</b> Heliconia psittacorum (cv.

40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to determine whether juice quality of 'Valencia' sweet orange [C. sinensis (L.)

During the 1998 - 99 and 1999 - 2000 seasons, fruit size and juice quality [soluble solids concentration (SSC) and titratable acidity (TA) ] of fruit from 'Valencia' sweet orange trees on Carrizo citrange rootstock [Poncirus trifoliata (L.) Raf. x C. sinensis (L.) Osb. ] planted in 1987 at Howey-in-the-Hills, Fla., were measured. A 2 x 2 factorial design (inflorescence type x canopy position) with leafy and leafless inflorescence types, and southwest top and northeast bottom canopy positions was used. The type <b>of</b> <b>inflorescence</b> on which fruit were borne had a minor effect on juice quality, and inflorescence type and juice quality were not directly associated. Rather, juice SSC was associated with the effect <b>of</b> <b>inflorescence</b> type on fruit size, as small fruit tended to have higher SSC than large fruit, regardless of the type <b>of</b> <b>inflorescence</b> on which fruit were borne. The relatively small difference in SSC between fruit borne on leafy and leafless inflorescences (≈ 3 % of mean SSC) was an indirect result of fruit size. Therefore, fruit borne on leafy inflorescences, which tend to be of larger size compared with fruit borne on leafless inflorescences, tended to have marginally lower SSC. Acid content and ratio of SSC:TA were not related to inflorescence type. In addition, the type <b>of</b> <b>inflorescence</b> on which fruit were borne made only a nominal contribution to variability in juice SSC, in contrast to the major contribution of canopy position to within-tree variation in juice SSC. Factors other than inflorescence type are important components of within-tree variation in juice SSC. Articl...|$|R

40|$|Buckwheat is characterised by a low grain yield {{despite an}} {{abundant}} formation of flowers {{through a long}} period of time. To understand the genesis of this low final yield (around 2000 - 2500 kg ha(- 1) in our weather conditions of Belgium), we studied, during 3 years in the field, the evolution of flowering and ripening <b>of</b> <b>inflorescences</b> or spikes located on the main stem of buckwheat plants of cultivar "La Harpe". We applied different treatments of defoliation (partial and complete) and partial removal <b>of</b> <b>inflorescences</b> <b>of</b> the main stem in order to modify the availability of photosynthates and to reduce the competition between kernels. In all cases, whatever the treatment, there was a drastic reduction of the grain number relative to the number of flowers formed, seed set being very low, around 20 - 30 %. Cumulative curves of development stages of flowers and kernels show clearly that complete flower senescence occurring early after full display of the corolla accounted for most of the low grain set, whatever the treatments and the trials. The critical stage of grain is clearly just after flowering and is not influenced by change in sink-source relations due to defoliation or removal <b>of</b> <b>inflorescences</b> parts. In a given <b>inflorescence,</b> the extent <b>of</b> this early senescence increases progressively from the base (near the peduncle) to the top <b>of</b> the <b>inflorescence.</b> A drastic reduction <b>of</b> competition between <b>inflorescences</b> and kernels (through partial removal <b>of</b> <b>inflorescences)</b> has only a negligible effect on final grain yield per plant, indicating a strong compensation by the remaining kernels. Thus, the limitation is associated to a strong sink restriction appearing only in some flowers and probably linked to internal flower structure and fertilization. (c) 2004 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Herbaceous peony (Paeonia lactiflora Pall.) is a {{traditional}} famous flower, but its poor inflorescence stem quality seriously constrains {{the development of the}} cut flower. Mechanical strength is an important characteristic of stems, which not only affects plant lodging, but also {{plays an important role in}} stem bend or break. In this paper, the mechanical strength, morphological indices and microstructure of P. lactiflora development inflorescence stems were measured and observed. The results showed that the mechanical strength <b>of</b> <b>inflorescence</b> stems gradually increased, and that the diameter <b>of</b> <b>inflorescence</b> stem was a direct indicator in estimating mechanical strength. Simultaneously, with the development <b>of</b> <b>inflorescence</b> stem, the number of vascular bundles increased, the vascular bundle was arranged more densely, the sclerenchyma cell wall thickened, and the proportion of vascular bundle and pith also increased. On this basis, cellulose and lignin contents were determined, PlCesA 3 , PlCesA 6 and PlCCoAOMT were isolated and their expression patterns were examined including PlPAL. The results showed that cellulose was not strictly correlated with the mechanical strength <b>of</b> <b>inflorescence</b> stem, and lignin had a significant impact on it. In addition, PlCesA 3 and PlCesA 6 were not key members in cellulose synthesis of P. lactiflora and their functions were also different, but PlPAL and PlCCoAOMT regulated the lignin synthesis of P. lactiflora.

S 184 produced more ripe inflorescences under both grazing managements than under mechanical defoliation. Optimum harvest date was not affected by management or variety, total inflorescence number and maximum ripe inflorescences having reached a peak on 11 September.

The diversity <b>of</b> <b>inflorescences</b> in the economically important family Oleaceae was studied from a comparative developmental point of view for the first time, based on species of seven genera (Chionanthus, Fontanesia, Fraxinus, Jasminum, Ligustrum, Olea, Syringa). • Methods: Series of developmental stages <b>of</b> chemically fixed <b>inflorescences</b> were studied with epi-illumination light microscopy. • Key results: All taxa studied have inflorescences with terminal flowers. The inflorescences are mostly panicles, but in some cases thyrsoids or compound botryoids. Phyllotaxis of the flower-subtending bracts is mostly decussate, rarely tricussate (Fraxinus) or spiral (Jasminum). Accessory flowers or accessory inflorescences, almost unknown in Oleaceae as yet, were found in two genera. In Syringa, common bract-flower primordia are formed by a delay in early bract development compared to flower development. Such a delay is also expressed by the loss of bracts in the distal part <b>of</b> <b>inflorescence</b> branches in Syringa and Chionanthus. • Conclusions: Significant variation in branching pattern and phyllotaxy was observed among the studied species of Oleaceae.
