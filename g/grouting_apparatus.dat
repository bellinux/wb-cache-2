The new box has overcome some limitations of previous pull-out boxes developed by other researchers, the first author, and his co-workers. The box has the following new features: (a) comprehensive transducers are installed, (b) an extension chamber is provided to house an extension {{part of the}} soil nail to keep the nail length inside the box constant throughout the testing, (c) a waterproof front cap is placed to cover and seal the soil nail head so that back water pressure {{can be applied to}} accelerate the saturation of the soil, and (d) a pressure <b>grouting</b> <b>apparatus</b> is constructed to make it possible to investigate the influence of the cement grouting pressure. The pull-out box can be used to study influences of (a) hole drilling process and stress release, (b) degree of saturation of the soil, (c) cement pressure grouting, (d) overburden pressure, etc. Two copies of such a new soil nail pull-out box have been constructed to accelerate the testing program. A series of soil nail pull-out tests has been conducted using the two boxes. This paper presents details of the new pull-out box, from design, boundary effect analysis, and instrumentation to setup. Typical results from soil nail pull-out tests are presented and discussed. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|E
