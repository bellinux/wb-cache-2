It was so long that in the UK, Australia and Israel its {{paperback}} edition was split in <b>half,</b> <b>Part</b> 1 being published as Steel and Snow in June 2001 (with the one-volume cover) and Part 2 as Blood and Gold in August 2001 (with a specially-commissioned new cover). The same division was used in the Polish and Greek editions. In France, {{the decision was made to}} cut the novel into four separate volumes.|$|E

The song was also nominated for an UK Festival Award in the category of Anthem of the Summer.

2500|$|From {{their initial}} gig at CBGB, the Plasmatics quickly {{rose in the}} New York City punk {{underground}} scene of the time. From playing a single weekday night, they moved quickly to playing repeated stands of four nights straight with two sold-out shows each night. They had lines stretching around the block and brought more fans into CBGB during this time than any other band in its history. The group quickly outgrew CBGB, largely {{because there were no}} intermediate rock venues to play in New York City at that time. The band's stage show soon became notorious, with acts such as chainsawing guitars in <b>half</b> <b>part</b> of their performance. Jim Farber of Sounds described the show: [...] "Lead singer/ex-porn star/current weightlifter Wendy Orleans Williams (W.O.W. for short) spends most of the Plasmatics' show fondling her family size breasts, scratching her sweaty snatch and eating the drum kit, among other playful events".|$|E
2500|$|Only about <b>half</b> <b>part</b> of Dacia {{then became}} a Roman province, with a newly built capital at Ulpia Traiana Sarmizegetusa, 40km away {{from the site of}} Old Sarmisegetuza Regia, which was razed to the ground. The name of the Dacians' homeland, Dacia, became the name of a Roman province, and the name Dacians was used to {{designate}} the people in the region. Roman Dacia, also Dacia Traiana or Dacia Felix, was a province of the Roman Empire from 106 to 271 or 275 AD. Its territory consisted of eastern and southeastern Transylvania, and the regions of Banat and Oltenia (located in modern Romania). Dacia was organised from the beginning as an imperial province, and remained so throughout the Roman occupation. It was one of the empire's Latin provinces; official epigraphs attest that the language of administration was Latin. [...] Historian estimates of the population of Roman Dacia range from 650,000 to 1,200,000.|$|E
2500|$|Close to Buckland Rings {{is another}} {{earthwork}} enclosure known as Ampress Camp (or Ampress Hole) (...) [...] It lies 360 metres east of Buckland Rings alongside Lymington River, and about 200 metres north of Lymington New Forest Hospital. Ampress Camp was noted by Thomas Wright in 1744, who {{described it as}} [...] "upon a lower Ground, close by a River (which defends it on one Side), with a Ditch and Vallum half round, {{and a kind of}} Morass on the other." [...] The outer rampart depicted by Wright has long since been flattened, and the ditches have been filled in. Waterworks occupy {{the northern part of the}} site, and commercial buildings have encroached upon the western <b>half.</b> <b>Part</b> of the interior (the southeastern part) is still viewable as a field, and a sunken lane runs a short distance along the line of the southern inner ditch. There have been only limited excavations, but a few scraps of pottery found at the site may date from the Iron Age. If the camp does date from the Iron Age, then it is unusual to have two Iron Age camps so close together. Ampress Camp may perhaps have formed a beachhead for the inhabitants of Buckland Rings, or it may have been occupied during a different period of the Iron Age.|$|E

60|$|And yet, even now, I {{should not}} except so much against it, {{if it were}} not carried on to such an excess, as is too much for a {{middling}} tradesman to bear the expense of. In this, therefore, it is made not a grievance only, but really scandalous to trade; for now, a young beginner has such a tax upon him before he begins, that he must sink perhaps a third part, nay, a <b>half</b> <b>part,</b> of his stock, in painting and gilding, wainscoting and glazing, before he begins to trade, nay, before he can open his shop. As they say of building a watermill, two-thirds of the expense lies under the water; and when the poor tradesman comes to furnish his shop, and lay in his stock of goods, he finds a great hole made in his cash to the workmen, and his show of goods, on which the life of his trade depends, is fain to be lessened to make up his show of boards, and glass to lay them in.|$|E
60|$|But {{this topic}} {{suggests}} a sad afterthought, that here {{we find the}} seat of his own pain. Possibly Swedenborg paid the penalty of introverted faculties. Success, or a fortunate genius, seems to depend on a happy adjustment of heart and brain; on a due proportion, hard to hit, of moral and mental power, which, perhaps, obeys the law of those chemical ratios which make a proportion in volumes necessary to combination, as when gases will combine in certain fixed rates, but not at any rate. It is hard to carry a full cup: and this man, profusely endowed in heart and mind, early fell into dangerous discord with himself. In his Animal Kingdom, he surprises us, by declaring that he loved analysis, and not synthesis; and now, after his fiftieth year, he falls into jealousy of his intellect; and, though aware that truth is not solitary, nor is goodness solitary, but both must ever mix and marry, he makes war on his mind, takes the part of the conscience against it, and, on all occasions, traduces and blasphemes it. The violence is instantly avenged. Beauty is disgraced, love is unlovely, when truth, the <b>half</b> <b>part</b> of heaven, is denied, as much as when a bitterness in men of talent leads to satire, and destroys the judgment. He is wise, but wise in his own despite. There is an air of infinite grief, and the sound of wailing, all over and through this lurid universe. A vampyre sits in the seat of the prophet, and turns with gloomy appetite to the images of pain. Indeed, a bird does not more readily weave its nest, or a mole bore into the ground, than this seer of souls substructs a new hell and pit, each more abominable than the last, round every new crew of offenders. He was let down through a column that seemed of brass, but it was formed of angelic spirits, that he might descend safely amongst the unhappy, and witness the vastation of souls; and heard there, for a long continuance, their lamentations; he saw their tormentors, who increase and strain pangs to infinity; he saw the hell of the jugglers, the hell of the assassins, the hell of the lascivious; the hell of robbers, who kill and boil men; the infernal tun of the deceitful; the excrementitious hells; the hell of the revengeful, whose faces resembled a round, broad-cake, and their arms rotate like a wheel. Except Rabelais and Dean Swift, nobody ever had such science of filth and corruption.|$|E
