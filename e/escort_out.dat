25|$|A dog-fight {{occurred}} {{near the}} Dorset coast, when 87 Squadron attacked the <b>escort</b> <b>out</b> {{of the sun}} and the squadron leader, John Dewar, hit the Bf110 of Staffelkäpitain Oberleutnant Gerhard Kadow; the aircraft crash-landed and Kadow tried to destroy his aircraft but was shot by approaching soldiers. Oberleutnant Hans-Joachim Göring, nephew of Hermann Göring and his gunner Unteroffizier Albert Zimmermann crashed into a cliff top at the Verne Citadel on the Isle of Portland, both being killed. Leutnant Friedrich-Wolfgang Graf von und zu Castell tried to help Göring but was killed, four Bf110s from 9. Staffel being lost with their crews. A Ju87 was destroyed and another force-landed, the light Stuka losses were a result of the Bf110s bearing the brunt of the attacks. One Hurricane was slightly damaged and its pilot unhurt. Hans-Joachim Göring was the first German fighter pilot to die on British soil. The British steamer Kylemount (704 GRT) was damaged off Dartmouth and the steamers Peru (6,961 GRT) and City of Melbourne (6,630 GRT) were damaged in Portland harbour. Eleanor Brooke (1,037 GRT) was damaged off Portland and the Dutch steamer Mies (309 GRT) was damaged south of Portland Bill.|$|E
500|$|In November 1927 Aiello {{organized}} machine-gun ambushes {{across from}} Lombardo's {{home and a}} cigar store frequented by Capone, but those plans were foiled after an anonymous tip led police to raid several addresses and arrest Milwaukee gunman Angelo La Mantio and four other Aiello gunmen. After the police discovered receipts for the apartments in La Mantio's pockets, he confessed that Aiello had hired him to kill Capone and Lombardo, leading the police to arrest Aiello himself and bring him to the South Clark Street police station. Upon learning of the arrest, Capone dispatched nearly two dozen gunmen to stand guard outside the station and await Aiello's release. The men {{made no attempt to}} publicly conceal their purpose there, and reporters and photographers rushed to the scene to observe Aiello's expected murder. Capone gunmen Frank Perry, Sam Marcus and Louis [...] "Little New York" [...] Campagna were arrested as they tried to enter the front of the station and placed in the cell next to Aiello, who Campagna told, [...] "You're dead, friend, dead. You won't get up {{to the end of the}} street still walking". Aiello pleaded for mercy and promised to sell his possessions and leave Chicago with his family if they let him go, but Campagna refused the request. When released, Aiello was given a police <b>escort</b> <b>out</b> of the station to safety. He later failed to make a court appearance after his attorney claimed he suffered a nervous breakdown. Aiello disappeared with some of family members to Trenton, NJ, where he continued his campaign against Capone and Lombardo.|$|E
2500|$|When the Second World War broke out, convoys {{protected}} {{only part}} of Umonas long route between Britain and the Indian Ocean. There were many outbound convoys that gave merchant ships only a few days' <b>escort</b> <b>out</b> of home waters.

2500|$|A convoy {{located on}} 26 February {{did not offer}} a chance of attack, because [...] had first fired on it causing its escorts to chase Balao from the scene. Two days later, Balao sighted smoke on the horizon and {{commenced}} tracking three ships and an escort. Shortly after midnight, Balao went to battle stations and closed for attack. After firing her six bow tubes at the lead ship, the submarine swung her stern toward the wing ships in the formation and fired her stern tubes. Balao heard several explosions at the expected times, as torpedo after torpedo struck home. One of the damaged ships trained a [...] gun on Balao, but a heavy internal explosion silenced the gun before Balao could be hit. The submarine could see nothing except heavy smoke in the target area, but radar watched as two [...] "pips" [...] disappeared from the screen. Balao lured the <b>escort</b> <b>out</b> of the target area in order to double back {{to look for the}} third freighter. Radar and lookouts failed to locate the merchantman, so Balao returned to patrol the shipping lanes after a very successful attack. Postwar study of Japanese shipping records identified her victims as the 2,723-ton freighter Shoho Maru and the 6,803-ton passenger cargoship Akiuro Maru.|$|E
2500|$|Waight {{would not}} score again {{until he was}} {{involved}} in the British offensive at the Battle of Amiens. On 8 August 1918, while piloted by William Frederick James Harvey, Waight shared in the destruction of two Pfalz D.IIIs in a dogfight northeast of Vitry; {{at least one of the}} shared wins was credited to another crew from 22 Squadron, John Everard Gurdon and Charles George Gass. On the evening of 11 August, he sent down a Fokker D.VII out of control southeast of Armentières, France for his fourth win. On the 13th, he destroyed a Rumpler and drove down its Pfalz D.III <b>escort</b> <b>out</b> of control northwest of Cambrai for victories five and six. The next day, a German two-seater fell from his guns, out of control southwest of Lille. Two days later, Waight destroyed a Pfalz D.III southeast of Lille. On 21 August, the victim was another unidentified German two-seater down out of control, this time over Ervillers. The next day, 22 August 1918, the crew of Waight and Harvey scored their last victory together; teamed with other crews from 22 Squadron, they destroyed a Halberstadt reconnaissance two-seater northeast of Bailleul. Waight finished out August 1918 by destroying a Fokker D.VII over Douai while piloted by South African ace Ian Oliver Stead ...|$|E
2500|$|Two British {{officers}} {{believed they}} had determined an opening to carry the war to the German fleet. Commodore Roger Keyes commanded a squadron of long-range submarines that regularly patrolled Heligoland Bight, while Commodore Reginald Tyrwhitt commanded a destroyer patrol, both operating from Harwich. They observed that German destroyers had adopted a regular pattern of patrols where each evening cruisers would <b>escort</b> <b>out</b> destroyers, which would patrol for British ships during the night before being met and escorted home each morning. Their idea was to send in a superior force during darkness to catch the German destroyers as they returned. Three British submarines would surface {{in a position to}} draw the destroyers back out to sea while a larger British force of 31 destroyers accompanied by nine submarines would cut them off from Germany. Other submarines would wait for any larger German ships leaving the Jade estuary to help. Keyes impressed First Lord of the Admiralty Winston Churchill by the daring of his plan, which was adopted but not without changes. An attack at 08:00 on the German daytime patrol was preferred. Keyes and Tyrwhitt requested support for their operation, in particular bringing the Grand Fleet south and the support of the squadron of six light cruisers commanded by Commodore William Goodenough. This was refused by the Chief of Staff—Vice Admiral Doveton Sturdee—who instead agreed to place only lighter forces; [...] "Cruiser Force K" [...] under Rear Admiral Gordon Moore consisting of two battlecruisers [...] and [...] to the north-west and [...] "Cruiser Force C" [...] a squadron of five Cressy-class armoured cruisers, , , , [...] and , [...] west.|$|E

The next day he returns to his room to <b>escort</b> <b>out</b> the sleeping Suzanne only to find money missing from his room. Bertrand blames Suzanne, even though both Suzanne and Guillaume had a chance to take the money, but Sophie thinks it more likely he was robbed earlier by Guillaume.|$|E
