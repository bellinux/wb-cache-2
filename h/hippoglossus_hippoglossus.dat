50|$|The Alligatorfish is preyed {{on by the}} Atlantic halibut (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus)</b> and the Pacific halibut (Hippoglossus stenolepis). Its own diet {{consists}} {{primarily of}} benthic crustaceans and bottom fauna.|$|E
50|$|The {{coat-of-arms}} is {{from modern}} times. They were granted on 15 May 1987. The arms show an Atlantic halibut (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus),</b> a main species of local fish, which symbolizes {{the importance of}} fishing for the local community. In addition to this, the fish {{played a major role}} in local legends, similar to the role of bears in land-based legends.|$|E
50|$|They {{are found}} on the bottoms of oceans around the world, with some species, such as the Atlantic halibut, <b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus,</b> being found down to 2000 m. The smaller species eat sea-floor {{invertebrates}} such as polychaetes and crustaceans, but the larger righteye flounders, such as H. hippoglossus, which grows up to 4.7 m in length, feed on other fishes and cephalopods, as well.|$|E
50|$|The roughhead {{grenadier}} is landed as a by-catch when fishing for Greenland halibut (Reinhardtius hippoglossoides) and Atlantic halibut (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus).</b> In a study off {{the east coast}} of Greenland, more males were taken by trawling and more females by long line. This seemed to be due to the females being in the depth range 1000 to 1500 m while the males predominated at shallower depths.|$|E
50|$|The Atlantic halibut (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus)</b> is a {{flatfish}} of {{the family}} Pleuronectidae. They are demersal fish living on or near sand, gravel or clay bottoms at depths of between 50 and 2000 m. The halibut is among the largest teleost (bony) fish in the world, and is an endangered species due to a slow rate of growth and previous overfishing. Halibut are strong swimmers {{and are able to}} migrate long distances. Halibut size is not age-specific, but rather tends to follow a cycle related to halibut (and therefore food) abundance.|$|E
5000|$|The {{advent of}} {{sequencing}} has permitted scientists to elucidate a huge landscape of new miRNAs, {{to increase our}} knowledge of the biogenesis involved and to discover putative post-transcriptional editing processes in miRNAs ignored until now. These processes mostly generate variations of the current miRNAs that are annotated in miRBase in the 3' and 5' terminus and in minor frequencies, nucleotide substitution along the miRNA length,. The variations are mainly generated by a shift of Drosha and Dicer in the cleavage site, but also by nucleotide additions at the 3'-end, resulting new sequences different from the annotated miRNA. These were named [...] "isomiRs" [...] by Morin et al., 2008. IsomiRs have been well established along different species in metazoa [...] and deeply described {{for the first time in}} human stem cells and human brain samples. Moreover, it has been proven that isomiRs are not caused by RNA degradation during sample preparation for next generation sequencing. Some studies have tried to explain the miRNA diversity by structural bases of precursors but without clear results. The functionality of adenylation or uridynilation at the 3'end (3'addition isomiRs) has been related to alterations in the miRNA-3'-UTR stability. Furthermore, isomiRs have been detected deregulated in D. melanogaster development and differential expressed during <b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus</b> L. early development, suggesting a biologically relevant function.|$|E

40|$|Four larvae of Atlantic halibut (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus)</b> were {{collected}} during a larval survey for Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua) in true inshore and shallow {{locations in the}} Norwegian fjord system Skjerstadfjorden. This observation contributes to the previous 57 larval specimens ever found for Atlantic halibut and is in accordance with earlier findings from aquaculture research on an ontogenetic change in phototaxi during larval development in this species. The catch sites indicate that shallow water in fjord systems may be of importance as nursery areas for early life stages of Atlantic halibut along the Norwegian coast...|$|E
40|$|Aquaculture feeds for {{carnivorous}} finfish {{species have}} been dependent upon the use of fish meal as {{the major source of}} dietary protein; however, the increasing demands upon the finite quantity of this high-quality protein source requires that feeds become increasingly comprised of alternative plant and/or animal protein. Soybean meal has been has been used to partially replace fish meal in the diets of several fish but it is known to cause enteritis in Atlantic salmon, Salmo salar.

40|$|The {{effect of}} ambient {{salinity}} on buoyancy {{and the formation}} of perivitelline fluid in eggs from the Atlantic halibut <b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus</b> have been investigated. The results clearly demonstrate that the water balance of the eggs are independant of the ambient salinity the first days after fertilization. The water loss from eggs fertilized in 17 ppt saline sea water was not less than from eggs fertilized in 34 ppt sea water in spite of a reduced osmotic gradient. Neither was the egg buoyancy altered by fertilization in low saline sea water. For proper fertilization, the eggs from the Atlantic halibut need concentrations of calcium near the concentration found in sea water...|$|E
40|$|Halibut (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus)</b> larvae {{were raised}} from {{hatching}} to beyond metamorphosis in 11. 5 m 3 plastic bags with a temperature stable around 6 °C. Standard length, myotome height, eye diameter and yolk sac length were measured on live or freshly preserved material. Mouth development and functionality, pectoral and pelvic fin development, intestinal {{development and the}} initiation of peristaltic contractions, and eye pigmentation and migration were observed from live material. The gape of the jaws was limited by an oral membrane which appeared coincident with the developing mouth and which persisted in either full or remnant form up to {{around the time of}} first feeding.

40|$|The Atlantic halibut (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus)</b> is {{distributed}} from Labrador to southern New England {{in the northwest}} Atlantic (Bigelow and Schroeder 1953). The Atlantic halibut stock within Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank waters (NAFO Subarea 5) has been exploited since the 1830 s. The Gulf of Maine-Georges Bank Atlantic halibut stock was last assessed in 2001 by the Northern Demersal Working Group (NEFSC 2001). The stock was overfished based on research survey indices and {{is not expected to}} rebuild in the near future. In this report, we update the Atlantic halibut assessment using fishery data for 2001 and available survey data for 2001 - 2002.

Lysozyme and anti-protease activity was detected and showed variable heat sensitivity. Unlike the anti-protease activity, the lysozyme activity of the sera was not sensitive to storage at − 20 ° C. No spontaneous haemolytic activity was observed and the sera had no bactericidal effect on any of the bacterial strains tested. Iron binding capacity of the sera was high. Individual variation was considerable in all the factors tested...|$|E
40|$|Background Flatfish {{metamorphosis}} {{denotes the}} extraordinary transformation of a symmetric pelagic larva into an asymmetric benthic juvenile. Metamorphosis in vertebrates {{is driven by}} thyroid hormones (THs), but how they orchestrate the cellular, morphological and functional modifications associated with maturation to juvenile/adult states in flatfish is an enigma. Since THs act via thyroid receptors that are ligand activated transcription factors, we hypothesized that the maturation of tissues during metamorphosis should be preceded by significant modifications in the transcriptome. Targeting the unique metamorphosis of flatfish and {{taking advantage of the}} large size of Atlantic halibut (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus)</b> larvae, we determined the molecular basis of TH action using RNA sequencing. Results De novo assembly of sequences for larval head, skin and gastrointestinal tract (GI-tract) yielded 90, 676, 65, 530 and 38, 426 contigs, respectively. More than 57...|$|E
30|$|The {{onset of}} the first feeding was {{observed}} at 3 days AH, as similarly reported in other groupers (Ching et al. 2012; Ch’ng and Senoo 2008; Yoseda et al. 2006). Although F 2 hybrid TGGG larvae {{is characterized by a}} small mouth size upon hatching, they were able to attain successful initiation of first feeding when Nannochloropsis sp. were co-introduced with rotifer into the rearing tank. A similar study reported the use of microalgae to compensate for delays in successful initiation of first feeding for small mouth size marine fish larvae, such as sea bream, Sparus aurata (Muller-Feuga et al. 2003), turbot Scophthalmus maximus and halibut, <b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus</b> (Reitan et al. 1997). In addition, additional microalgae in the tanks created the “green water” rearing condition, thus offering a positive effect on the survival rates of F 2 hybrid TGGG at an early stage.|$|E
40|$|Flatfish {{metamorphosis}} involves major {{physiological and}} morphological changes. Due to its importance in aquaculture {{and as a}} model for developmental studies, some gene expression studies have focused on the understanding of this process using quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) technique. Therefore, adequate reference genes for accurate normalization are required. The stability of 12 potential reference genes was examined during larval development in Senegalese sole (Solea senegalensis) and Atlantic halibut (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus)</b> to determine the most suitable genes for qRT-PCR analysis. This work suggests RPS 4, UBQ, and eEF 1 A 1 genes as useful reference genes for accurate normalization in qRT-PCR studies in Senegalese sole and Atlantic halibut larvae. The congruent results between both species in spite of the drastic differences in larval development suggest that selected housekeeping genes (HKGs) could be useful in other flatfish species...|$|E
40|$|Variation {{in growth}} and {{reproduction}} dynamics of fish populations substantially affects production in wild {{as well as}} domesticated fish populations. Identifying the intrinsic and environmental factors which influence the dynamics of these traits is important for stock assessment methodology and management of wild fish populations {{as well as for}} improving production in aquaculture. In this paper the relationship between growth and maturation of cod (Gadus morhua) and Atlantic halibut (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus)</b> is described using data from spawning locations along the Norwegian coast. Both species show an inverse relationship between immature growth and age/size at first spawning. Long term trends may be connected to climatic changes {{as well as to the}} increased exploitation experienced in this century. Short-term variation may be caused by abrupt changes in the conditions for growth, e. g. due to temperature shifts and/or variation in prey abundance...|$|E
40|$|Filamentous black yeasts {{from the}} genus Exophiala are ubiquitous, {{opportunistic}} pathogens causing both superficial and systemic mycoses in warm- and cold-blooded animals. Infections by black yeasts {{have been reported}} relatively frequently {{in a variety of}} captive and farmed freshwater and marine fish. In November 2012, moribund and recently dead farm raised Atlantic halibut (<b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus)</b> were necropsied to determine the cause of death. Histopathology revealed that three of five fish were affected by a combination of an ascending trans-ureter granulomatous mycotic nephritis, necrotizing histiocytic encephalitis, and in one fish the addition of a fibrogranulomatous submucosal branchitis. Microbial cultures of kidney using selective mycotic media revealed pure growth of a black pigmenting septated agent. Application of molecular and phenotypic taxonomy methodologies determined that all three isolates were genetically consistent with Exophiala angulospora. This is the first report of Exophiala angulospora as the causal agent of systemic mycosis in Atlantic halibut...|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} {{of early}} life stages of turbot Scophthalmus maximus and halibut <b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus</b> to Aeromonas salmonicida subsp. salmonicida was studied in challenge experiments. Eggs of both fish species (and the larvae hatching from the eggs) {{were exposed to}} the bacterium. Larvae of both species experienced mortality during the yolk sac stage, apparently {{as a result of the}} challenge. Examination of histological sections revealed degenerative changes in the skeletal muscle of both species of larvae. The bacterium could not be recovered from the larvae by culture, but it was shown to be present in the intestinal lumen of some of the turbot larvae examined using an immunohistochemical technique known to be specific for the bacterium. The results indicate that marine fish larvae exposed to A. salmonicida subsp. salmonicida may become infected and that the bacterium may persist in the larvae. Turbot larvae seemed to be more susceptible than halibut larvae...|$|E
40|$|Surveys {{designed}} to capture Atlantic halibut, <b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus,</b> postlarvae and young immatures {{were carried out}} around Sørøya in North Norway in 1985, 1986 and 1987. Hydrographical conditions and the current features in the area were also investigated. The ichthyoplankton trawls (MOCNESS, Tucker-trawl) filtered more than 200. 000 m 3 of sea water in the March months. Only one single pelagic postlarvae, 11. 9 mm long and in a stase of first feeding, was captured, {{near the center of}} a cyclonic vortex in Sørøysundet. Most probably, the filtering capacity of the equipment used was too low given the low concentrations in which halibut larvae seem to occur. Trawling with a pelagic trawl in May yielded no pelagic postlarvae. The shallow (20 - 60 m) area north of sørøya act as a halibut nursery area where considerable amounts of young, immature fish aged 2 - 4 years are found...|$|E
40|$|Betanodavirus infects both larvae and {{juvenile}} fish {{and can cause}} the disease viral encephalopathy and retinopathy (VER). During an acute outbreak of VER, infected individuals display several clinical signs of infection, i. e. abnormal swimming pattern and loss of appetite. Betanodaviruses can also cause chronic or persistent infection where the infected individuals show no clinical signs of infection. During infection the viral sub-genomic RNA 3 and the RNA 3 -encoded B 2 protein are expressed. Antibodies against the B 2 protein from Atlantic halibut nodavirus were raised and used together with antibodies against the capsid protein to detect {{the presence of these}} 2 viral proteins in infected cells in culture and at different stages of infection in Atlantic halibut <b>Hippoglossus</b> <b>hippoglossus</b> and Atlantic cod Gadus morhua. The B 2 protein was detected in recently infected, but not in chronically infected fish. Results suggest that the detection of B 2 may be used to discriminate a recent and presumably active infection from a chronic and presumably persistent infection...|$|E
