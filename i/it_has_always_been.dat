5|$|Children, ages 11–17, {{volunteer}} to become altar servers {{not only to}} serve the church but also because <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> looked upon as an honor. It {{is a chance for}} children to serve their priest and become closer to Jesus by being on the altar. In addition, it is an opportunity for them to try to make themselves more holy and therefore more worthy of the position.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1927 in Jerusalem by Salomon Angel, Angel Bakeries {{introduced}} to the Israeli market the first sliced bread, plant-based emulsifiers, and new baking technologies. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> family-run, at first by Salomon with his brothers and sons, then by Salomon's grandsons, and today by Salomon's great-grandsons. The company, Salomon A. Angel Ltd., is publicly traded on the Tel Aviv Stock Exchange, with a turnover of $180 million in 2008.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{important}} for the Space Telescope to capture the public's imagination, given the considerable contribution of taxpayers to its construction and operational costs. After the difficult early years when the faulty mirror severely dented Hubble's reputation with the public, the first servicing mission allowed its rehabilitation as the corrected optics produced numerous remarkable images.|$|E

5|$|Obligatory {{psychological}} {{testing for}} gun owners {{is a common}} subject of discussion, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> rejected. Gun advocates {{point out that the}} nature of the tests and the parties responsible for them are not clear. It is also pointed out that it is unlikely that any psychological testing would reveal a potentially dangerous individual, because some famous killers in the past were members of the military or the law enforcement and passed very difficult psychological testing successfully.|$|E
5|$|Railways {{have been}} the primary way of linking {{countries}} in the Eurasian Economic Union since the 19th century. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> the main way of transport in the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union up until today. The union ranks 2nd {{in the world in}} terms of railway trackage (about 7.8% of the world's share). However it is still looking to improve cross-border trade within the union.|$|E
5|$|They {{believe it}} is a Christianity {{that is in the}} New Testament; that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> there, that in the drift of ages it was lost through disuse and neglect, and that this benefactor has found it and given it back to men, turning the night of life into day, its terrors into myths, its lamentations into songs of {{emancipation}} and rejoicing.|$|E
50|$|No {{official}} {{explanation as}} given {{as to how}} this type of Quickening developed, or if <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> possible.|$|R
50|$|Dr France {{claims that}} he was simply the {{guardian}} of Everton's history. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> his desire {{that the people of}} Merseyside have access to his treasures.|$|R
6000|$|She said [...] "Womanly?" [...] with {{a little}} cry. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> such a sweet word to her, and she thought it could never be hers again! ...|$|R
5|$|After impressing {{with the}} {{reserves}} in 2001, Hall {{was drafted by}} Essendon with the 46th selection in the 2002 AFL Rookie Draft, thereby placing him on the Bombers' rookie list. Speaking to The Mercury, Hall described the opportunity as exciting said that <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> his dream {{to play in the}} AFL. In the lead-up to the 2002 season Hall played in all three of Essendon's pre-season matches, of which the Bombers lost every game. Rookie listed players must be promoted to the senior list before they play a senior AFL match, so Hall began the 2002 season playing in the VFL for Essendon's reserves team.|$|E
5|$|Eventually, Felix's {{party is}} able to achieve {{entrance}} into Piers' home, a legendary, secluded Atlantis-like society named Lemuria far out in the ocean. When they convene with Lemuria's ancient king, Hydros, they learn about Alchemy's true nature; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> the sustenance of Weyard's very life force, and its absence over the past ages has caused the world's continents to decrease in size {{and parts of the}} world to collapse into the abyss. Knowing that restoring Alchemy is what must be done to actually save the world, Felix crosses the sea in order to activate Jupiter Lighthouse. But when Isaac's pursuing party enters the lighthouse, they are trapped and ambushed by Karst and Agatio. Felix rescues Isaac, but Karst and Agatio escape with the Mars Star formerly in Isaac's possession.|$|E
5|$|Texas Tech's other mascot, Raider Red, is a {{more recent}} creation. Beginning with the 1971 {{football}} season, the Southwest Conference forbade the inclusion of live animal mascots to away games unless the host school consented. For situations where the host school {{did not want to}} allow the Masked Rider's horse, an alternate mascot was needed. Jim Gaspard, a member of the Saddle Tramps student spirit organization, created the original design for the Raider Red costume, basing it on a character created by cartoonist Dirk West, a Texas Tech alumnus and former Lubbock mayor. Though the Masked Rider's identity is public knowledge, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> tradition that Raider Red's student alter ego is kept secret until the end of his or her tenure. The student serving as Raider Red {{is a member of the}} Saddle Tramps or High Riders.|$|E
50|$|Virtually {{nothing was}} known about Driscoll until quite recently. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> thought that Louis Comfort Tiffany was the chief {{designer}} behind the greatest of the Tiffany leaded lamps.|$|R
6000|$|... "Why {{not let me}} go to New York in your place," [...] {{suggested}} Jerry, quickly. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{the ambition}} of his life to pay a visit to the great metropolis.|$|R
50|$|At {{the end of}} Jin Dynasty and the {{beginning}} of Yuan dynasty, Zhangdian became famous as a trade center. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a city of significance for Yuan, Ming and Qing dynasty.|$|R
25|$|The {{centrality}} of the street, both geographically and culturally, has meant <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a site of mansions, churches and important buildings.|$|E
25|$|Since preservation, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a {{long-term}} {{plan for the}} preserved Embsay and Bolton Abbey Steam Railway to extend into Skipton.|$|E
25|$|The {{contemporary}} Québec Liberal Party is {{a broad-based}} federalist coalition including {{among its members}} some supporters of the federal Liberals, New Democratic Party, and Conservatives. In terms of voter support, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> able {{to rely on the}} great majority of non-francophones in Québec.|$|E
60|$|She {{bowed her}} head gravely. The tone of {{hopelessness}} {{in which he said}} these things grieved her deeply. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a failure between them. Tacitly, she acquiesced in what he felt.|$|R
25|$|The {{basin of}} Eger and the hilly region around <b>it</b> <b>have</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> very {{suitable}} for human settlements, {{and there are}} many archaeological findings from the early ages of history, which support this fact.|$|R
60|$|And then I {{had gone}} by, and the Universe {{was very much}} as <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> except for the wild swirl in it, and the faint sense of {{insecurity}} my episode left in its wake.|$|R
25|$|Orbital Sciences Corporation {{was founded}} in 1982 to provide rocket engines and parts to {{aerospace}} and defense customers public and private. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> headquartered in Northern Virginia, like many other defense contractors. In 1993 it moved into its current complex in Dulles.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{widespread}} adoption of transcontinental air {{travel in the}} second half of the twentieth century, Congress began meeting year-round. Since that time, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> in session on every occasion when the President might otherwise have perceived the need to call Congress into extraordinary session.|$|E
25|$|Like most of cycling's classics, {{the route}} has {{developed}} considerably over the years, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> {{run in the}} provinces of East-Flanders and West-Flanders. In the first 30 years the race was run from Ghent to Ghent, although {{the location of the}} finish in Ghent changed every few years.|$|E
60|$|ON former {{occasions}} {{of doubt}} or difficulty, <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> Oscar's habit {{to follow the}} opinions of others. On this occasion {{he was the first}} to speak, and to assert an opinion of his own.|$|R
5000|$|I {{simply had}} to fulfill my ambitions of {{starting}} my own company. <b>It</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> an obsession of mine … that there be no interference with our work; that we must have authority. David O. Selznick ...|$|R
60|$|Lady Underhill bowed stiffly {{and without}} pleasure. She was not {{fond of the}} Last of the Rookes. She {{supposed}} the Almighty had had some wise purpose in creating Freddie, but <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> inscrutable to her.|$|R
25|$|The {{west side}} of the city has {{historically}} been more culturally diverse. People of many faiths, races, and backgrounds live in the neighborhoods of Rose Park, Westpointe, Poplar Grove, and Glendale. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> considered a classic and diverse area, although recently its affordability has attracted many professionals and the more youthful generation.|$|E
25|$|No, I do not now retire freely—there {{was much}} I {{still wanted to}} do—but {{circumstances}} present me no alternative. I leave active military service because I must. But {{for the rest of}} my life, the Army will be no less a part of me, and of what I am, than what <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been.</b>|$|E
25|$|Like junior cricket <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> a tough {{assignment}} {{to get a}} Ladies Team {{to be associated with}} the club but with winning comes recognition and in the early 80's Ellerslie gained a ready made team from ALHA made up of some very good cricketers including past NZ & Auckland reps.|$|E
6000|$|... "You must {{understand}} me very little, Mrs. Quest" [...] (<b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> Belle before, and she {{winced at the}} changed name), [...] "if you think me capable of such conduct. You {{have nothing to fear}} from me." ...|$|R
50|$|The {{first three}} shows were {{performed}} without a live drummer, but <b>it</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> the band's intention {{to be able}} play with live drums. In the end Max Franken from Malka's band Minimal Compact became the band's drummer.|$|R
6000|$|Something in {{the sound}} of that [...] "No" [...] touched Winton with a vague--a very vague--compunction. To be left by Gyp! Then his heart {{hardened}} again. The fellow was a rotter--he <b>was</b> sure of <b>it,</b> <b>had</b> <b>always</b> <b>been</b> sure.|$|R
