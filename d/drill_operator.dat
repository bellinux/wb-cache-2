5|$|An {{attempt to}} open a sealed chamber using a Borazon drill fails to make progress. However, a few moments after the drill is stopped, a small hole is seen, though the <b>drill</b> <b>operator,</b> Sladden (Duncan Lamont), is certain it was not created by his machine. The hole widens to reveal the corpses of three-legged, insectoid creatures with horned heads. Roney and Judd work to {{preserve}} the bodies before they decay. An examination of the creatures' physiology suggests {{they came from the}} planet Mars. Quatermass and Roney note the similarity between the appearance of the creatures and images of the Devil.|$|E
5|$|Carl Eric Wickman {{was born}} in Sweden in 1887.

In 1914, using his remaining vehicle, a 7-passenger car, he began a bus service with Andy (Bus Andy) Anderson and C.A.A.

40|$|During {{a recent}} National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health field {{evaluation}} of a newly designed filtration and pressurization system for an enclosed cab of a surface drill, {{it was determined that}} the <b>drill</b> <b>operator's</b> respirable-dust exposure was significantly increased during time periods when the cab door was opened to manually guide another section of drill steel into place to achieve additional cutting depth. Although no dust cloud was visible when the door was opened to perform this task, the <b>drill</b> <b>operator's</b> exposure was documented (over a three-day test period) to be nine times higher than when the cab door was closed. Even at this higher respirable-dust concentration, the <b>drill</b> <b>operator's</b> exposure remained well below the permissible exposure limit governed by the federal dust standard; however, an alternative method is being investigated to guide the drill steel in place in order to eliminate this increased exposure. ...|$|R

500|$|Quatermass and the Pit {{continues}} to be generally well regarded among critics. John Baxter notes in Science Fiction in the Cinema that “Baker's unravelling of this crisp thriller is tough and interesting. [...] The film has moments of pure terror, perhaps the most effective that in which the <b>drill</b> <b>operator,</b> driven off the spaceship by the mysterious power within is {{caught up in a}} whirlwind that fills the excavation with a mass of flying papers.” John Brosnan, writing in The Primal Scream, found that, “As a condensed version of the serial, the film is fine but the old black-and-white version, though understandably creaky in places and with inferior effects, still works surprisingly well, having more time to build up a disturbing atmosphere. Bill Warren in Keep Watching the Skies! said, “The ambition of the storyline is contained in a well-constructed mystery that unfolds carefully and clearly”. Nigel Kneale had mixed feelings about the end result: he said, “I was very happy with Andrew Keir, who they eventually chose, and very happy with the film. There are, however, a few things that bother me... The special effects in Hammer films were always diabolical.” ...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} health risks of blast-hole <b>drill</b> <b>operators</b> exposed to whole-body vibration (WBV), based on ISO standard 2631 - 1. Assessment of health risk associated with the blast-hole <b>drill</b> <b>operators</b> based on ISO 2631 - 1 criteria is limited. In the current study, operators’ WBV exposure was measured in accordance with ISO 2631 - 1 using a tri-axial seat pad accelerometer at the operator/seat interface. WBV exposure was evaluated along all three orthogonal axes by frequency-weighted RMS acceleration and vibration dose value. Result of the study shows that mean frequency weighted RMS acceleration along Z-axis is dominant as compared to X and Y axis. In the case of VDV exposure, the mean VDV along Z-axis is also higher as compared to X and Y axis however magnitude of mean vector sum of VDV is lower compared to the Z-axis. The predicted health risk of operators based on daily RMS exposure shows that only 3. 6 % of <b>drill</b> machine <b>operators</b> were found between the recommended upper and lower limit of health caution zone of ISO standard 2631 - 1. However, based on VDV evaluation method, all the <b>drill</b> machine <b>operators</b> were found above the recommended upper limit of health caution zone of ISO standard 2631 - 1. Thus, results observed in this study based on two methods for assessing the health risk of operators’ are quite similar depending upon the method applied...|$|R

2500|$|The {{following}} day, however, confirmations of {{the agreement}} came from Lonmin and unions. Commission for Conciliation, Mediation and Arbitration commissioner Afzul Soobedaar said: [...] "We have reached an agreement that we have worked tirelessly for" [...] and that the negotiations were an arduour process but congratulated all parties for being committed to reach a solution. National Union of Mineworker's negotiator Eric Gcilitshana said that there would now be stability at Lonmin with the return to work; while President of the Association of Mineworkers and Construction Joseph Mathunjwa issued a statement that read: [...] "This {{could have been done}} without losing lives." [...] Lonmin spokesman in South Africa Abbey Kgotle said they were content with the resolution after difficult talks and that the agreement was dedicated to those killed. The final resolution entailed the miner working at the lowest depths earning between R9,611 from the previous R8,164, a winch operator would now earn R9,883 up from R8,931, a rock <b>drill</b> <b>operator</b> would earn R11,078 from R9,063 and a production team leader would earn R13,022 from R11,818.

40|$|Hand Arm Vibration Syndrome (HAVS) is a {{collective}} {{term for the}} symptoms arising from the prolonged use of vibrating hand tools. An investigation into the literature on available screening tools for HAVS was conducted. A screening tool {{is used for the}} quick identification of certain symptoms without a full medical check up, and is for use by mine medical personnel for the determination of workers with HAVS symptoms and those without. Twenty-two non-exposed volunteers were tested with the screening tools and forty-two rock <b>drill</b> <b>operators.</b> Only the rock <b>drill</b> <b>operators</b> had a medical examination and standardised tests for HAVS diagnoses, to determine their HAVS diagnosis and severity. This diagnosis was used as the standard for the evaluation, of existing screening tools and for developed screening tool, sensitivity for the detection of HAVS symptoms. The screening tools chosen were a traditional tuning fork, a similar tuning fork but mounted into a box with a set excitation unit and a two-point discriminator set a 3 mm, 6 mm, and 10 mm apart. The results showed that a screening questionnaire that specifically focuses on the symptoms of HAVS has better sensitivity and specificity to identify cases. A two-point discriminator with variable distance points, where patients have to distinguish between one pin prick and two, was able to identify HAVS cases when the distance was set at 3 mm. However, the sensitivity of the two-point discriminator was lower than the sensitivity of the questionnaire. Dissertation (MSc) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

30|$|Lost {{circulation}} (LOC) is {{a challenge}} for many <b>drilling</b> <b>operators.</b> It significantly increases drilling expenses due {{to the loss of}} massive amounts of drilling fluids and potentially loses expensive downhole equipment or even the entire well section (Howard and Scott 1951; Clapper et al. 2011; Almagro et al. 2014; Alsaba et al. 2014 a; Ghalambor et al. 2014). The problem also consumes some valuable time spent for regaining the circulating system and solving subsequence problems known as the nonproductive time (Salehi and Nygaard 2012; Almagro et al. 2014; Feng et al. 2016). The serious concern is that LOC can lead to a well control issue, which can potentially lead to a life-threatening blowout accident (Horn 1950; Kageson-Loe et al. 2009).|$|R
