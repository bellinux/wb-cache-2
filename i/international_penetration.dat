30|$|Here, {{we examine}} {{a set of}} global cities using images from a popular home rental site, Airbnb ([URL] Airbnb allows members to list their {{personal}} homes {{as an alternative to}} hotels for visitors, and provides interiors images of the spaces for rent in their postings. Airbnb was chosen for its <b>international</b> <b>penetration,</b> corporate validity and temporal online persistence, as well as its ability to represent thoughtfully-photographed global residential interiors, i.e. everyday homes. This site offers over five million listings in 191 countries and 81, 000 locales. The listed rentals are uniquely created and furnished by individuals and families (although exceptions exist). While they can be decorated to entice consumers [9], the interiors also have an added personal dimension of individual decor and style choices. We originally collected over one million listing images and analyzed over 130, 000 images representing about 54, 000 living rooms from 107 global cities in 65 countries over six continents, and in detail in six U.S. cities (Chicago, Houston, Los Angeles, New York, Philadelphia and Washington, D.C.). We specifically chose listings where renters rented a bedroom in a unit or home, i.e. not a hostel-style room or the whole home/unit, in order to capture homes where the owner may live. While it is not guaranteed that the owner also lives on site, this check increases the likelihood that the owner lives in the house and ostensibly decorated the common spaces [10].|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the penetration of Greek publications {{in the international}} literature by scientific category. METHOD: We used the publications database of the Institute for Scientific Information® (ISI), the search engine that is available through its web pages {{as well as a}} re-tabulation of the 120 scientific categories of ISI into 50 broader categories. We counted the publications that appeared during the decade 1994 - 2003 in the 30 journals of each category with the highest impact factor (IF) and, among them, the proportion of the Greek publications. A more valid comparison between scientific categories was attempted using a new index, the index of Greek contribution (IGC), that takes into account the relative number (‰) of Greek publications among the sum of publications of each category in the 30 most prominent journals as well as the journals' IFs. RESULTS: The 20528 Greek publications represent the 4. 73 ‰ of all the 4, 340, 793 publications appearing in the above ISI journals during the decade 1994 - 2003. The distribution of Greek publications by scientific category indicates that more than 55 % of the publications originated from medical specialties. Among them, Oncology and Heart Diseases were the specialties with the highest <b>international</b> <b>penetration.</b> CONCLUSIONS: The presence of Greek scientific publications in the international literature is noticeable, if the population of the country is taken in account, but further improvement is necessary.

40|$|Since {{the early}} sixties {{traditional}} machinery suppliers, almost exclusively located in highly advanced economies, {{have been subject}} to considerable adjustment pressures. Among the most important causes, firstly, was the increasing <b>international</b> <b>penetration</b> of markets among traditional machinery suppliers % secondly, Japan emerged as a vigourous competitor; and thirdly, a number of semiindustrialized countries established mechanical engineering industries of their own which in certain activities even proved capable of successfully competing on the world market. As these events have affected and still affect the international division of labour in the machinery industry, the future role of machinery in highly advanced economies may become somewhat uncertain, particularly as the establishment of machinery industries in developing countries continues. In order to obtain an understanding of implications for the high-income countries, we shall focus on the recent development of machinery in the United States, Sweden, and the Federal Republic of Germany. These countries have been selected for investigation because they belong to the most advanced economies in the world but differ in the size of their domestic market and in their structure of production. Analyzing these countries, {{the purpose of this paper}} is firstly, to specify determinants of location for the machinery industry as a whole, and secondly to identify individual branches of machinery, if any, in which these highest-income countries are tending to lose their competitiveness. In part I a multi-country cross-section analysis is undertaken to determine a normal pattern of development for the machinery industry. For the United States, Sweden, and Germany deviations from this normal pattern are used to diagnosticize country-specific idiosyncracies. Besides this, the normal pattern itself has useful prognostic properties. Part II discusses some determinats of location. Changes in relative factor absorption,. as well as economies of scale and national idiosyncracies are examined for their implications on the high-income countries as advantageous locations for the machinery industry. Part III applies the concept of revealed comparative advantage to 36 sub-industries of machinery. ...|$|E

Findings indicate that the Internet has given firms the capabilities to become instantly or rapidly international. The acceleration of internationalisation changes the once slow ands cumbersome process of advancing the firm’s product into international markets. Further, new virtual network intermediaries or electronic marketplaces reduce the need for the firm to have human and financial infrastructures necessary for internationalisation. However, more traditional relationship networks are still the primary mechanism for internationalisation. Thus, a new theory of internationalisation is not needed bu...|$|R

The Lyman- a actinic flux is calculated with a Monte Carlo approach including multiple resonance scattering of Lyman- a photons within the terrestrial atmosphere and a temperature dependent {{absorption cross section}} of molecular oxygen. The dependence of the actinic flux on the temperature profile is significant for O 2 column densities greater than about 10 24 m - 2. For column densities greater than about 5 · 10 24 m - 2 resonance scattering becomes important at solar zenith angles > 60 °. The O(1 D) quantum yield of the O 2 dissociation by Lyman- a photons is found to decrease from 0. 58 in the lower thermosphere to 0. 48 in the lower mesosphere.

40|$|<b>International</b> audienceIntergranular <b>penetration</b> {{of liquid}} bismuth has been {{analysed}} in two pure metals, Cu at 500 °C and Ni at 700 °C, used either as polycrystals or as oriented bicrystals. At the liquid/solid interface, large grooves have developed in Cu–Bi, while micrometer-thick films {{were observed in}} Ni–Bi. The bismuth concentration measurements obtained by Auger electron spectroscopy indicate a zone of monolayer Bi segregation followed by a diffusion-type profile over a distance {{of the order of}} 100 μm for Cu–Bi and a nanometer-thick film followed by similar diffusion-type profile for Ni–Bi.

40|$|The paper {{sets out}} to {{analyses}} the approach of Southern Italian regions {{in the way they}} are developing different types of tourist products. In an attempt to measure tour operator preferences that impact the offer features, the tour operators’ profiles have been traced, through a cluster analysis, in order to develop the market of new tourist products in Southern Italy. The findings prove that the attitude of foreign tourists in choosing Southern Italian destinations is influenced not only by seaside location and cultural products but also by alternative features, such as natural resources and enogastronomic traditions, which represent the differentiating and value-creating elements of the basic product. Moreover, the accommodation chosen confirms international tour operator loyalty. The cluster definition helps in identifying collective strategies to promote macro destinations, connecting similar places linked by tourist need satisfaction. Future research should consider the different typologies of tour operators and try to compare different areas of Europe with Italy. Practical implications – New forms of tourism require specific and differentiated strategies supported by forms of <b>international</b> market <b>penetration.</b> The marketing thrusts should focus on the place vocation and a local hospitality system, developing and marketing local tourist products.
