40|$|Abstract The {{main purpose}} of this study was to analyse adult female gown made with adapted {{patterns}} and free <b>hand</b> <b>cutting.</b> The specific objectives are to determine whether bodice part of a female gown, skirt part of a female gown and a female gown made with adapted patterns fit better than the ones made with free <b>hand</b> <b>cutting.</b> There were three research questions from which three null hypotheses were formulated. The study utilized an experimental design. A sample of 30 students was drawn from the target population of 550 Home Economics students of Federal College of Education (Technical) Omoku and University of Education, Port Harcourt. A systematic sampling technique was used to select the sample. Instrument used for the study was a 4 -point likert scale questionnaire of strongly agreed, agreed, disagreed and strongly disagreed. Values were assigned as follows: SA- 4, A- 3, D- 2, and SD- 1. The data collected was systematically analysed using mean and t-test. The three hypotheses were tested at 0. 05 level of significance. Findings revealed that a female gown made with adapted patterns fits better on the shoulder, sleeve, bust, waist, and hip than a gown made with free <b>hand</b> <b>cutting.</b> Findings also revealed that the gown made with adapted pattern look more outstanding and dressy than the one made with free <b>hand</b> <b>cutting.</b> Based on these findings, some recommendations were made. It was recommended that: Graduates of Home Economics that specialize in Clothing and Textiles should be encouraged to establish industries where they can make patterns according to contemporary fashion in sizes for sale. There should be an awareness programme organized by Home Economists to dressmakers who uses free <b>hand</b> <b>cutting</b> to make use of adapted patterns in sewing. Seminars/workshops should be organized by Home Economists on pattern making regularly for dressmakers...|$|R

500|$|Until the mid-twentieth century, all peat {{was cut by}} hand. Although {{the effects}} of the {{industry}} on the ecology of the moors were serious, <b>hand</b> <b>cutting</b> mainly affected the surface of the moors. It left behind trenches and ditches, which soon became waterlogged, and were re-colonised {{to become part of the}} diverse habitat. Once the cutting process was mechanised, peat could be cut from a greater depth, and at a faster rate, resulting in less ability for the moors to recover. Mechanical peat cutting was introduced to the moors in the early 1960s, and the process was similar to <b>hand</b> <b>cutting,</b> in that the peat was extracted over a small area but to a considerable depth. More destructive to the ultimate regeneration of the moors was the introduction of peat milling in 1985, where a thin layer of peat was stripped from a wider area. Thus in 1910, around 56 tonnes per acre were extracted from [...] of the moors, whereas in 1985 the yield was 10 tonnes per acre over double that area. As early as the late 1960s, academics and conservation agencies expressed concerns that the moors had been so badly damaged by peat extraction and farming that they were not worth saving.|$|R
40|$|Currently, {{the lowest}} {{productivity}} of workers {{involved in the}} production of the “carasau bread” is in those plants where automation has still not reached optimal levels in certain parts of the process, such as, for example, in the cutting and separating of the puff pastry. In the present work we analyse and compare the performance of three systems of cutting and separating in three different types of plant: by hand (traditional); by hand with a conveyor belt that supplies the workers with the material (traditional with conveyor belt) and completely mechanized (continuous). The experiment showed that the use of an automated system of cutting supplied from a conveyor belt reduced the time of the cutting phase for puff pastry by 87. 1 % with respect to <b>hand</b> <b>cutting</b> supplied by conveyor belt and by 87. 9 % with respect to the traditional system. If we consider the hourly productivity of the workers, we see that use of a conveyor belt increases productivity in a traditional bakery by 42. 3 %, while the use of the continuous system increases productivity by 87. 8 % compared to the traditional system and by 78. 3 % with respect to <b>hand</b> <b>cutting</b> supplied by conveyor belt...|$|R
40|$|The risk of Salmonella {{contamination}} {{along the}} pork production is a worldwide concern. Not only the biological contamination, but also personal perception and individual behavior {{play a role}} for risk assessment along a chain. This study is to identify the prevalence and number of Salmonella in 3 pig slaughterhouses in relation to several risk factors. During January to April 2013, a total of 87 samples (carcasses, workers' <b>hands,</b> <b>cutting</b> board and belly skin material) were collected from 4 visits to each slaughterhouse. A 3 -tube Most Probable Number (MPN) was applied to quantify the number of Salmonella from carcass, workers' <b>hands,</b> <b>cutting</b> board and belly skin samples (35 samples). The result showed that Salmonella prevalence was 36. 9 % (26. 7 - 47. 8 %), mostly found on worker's hands (50 %) and the lowest from cutting board (33. 3 %). The highest number of Salmonella on carcass and cutting boards was less than 0. 075 MPN/cm 2 and 1. 2 MPN/cm 2, respectively. Potential riskfactors were tested however they were not statistical significant. This study underlines the necessity of good hygiene practices and management in slaughterhouses. In terms of food safety, further risk assessment of Salmonella in pork production chains is needed...|$|R

Roughness result shows that the surface is smoother as the cutting speed increases until it reaches the optimum speed. On the other <b>hand</b> <b>cutting</b> speed that is beyond the optimum value results in more vibration, thus generating rough surface. Meanwhile increasing the feed rate shows higher surface roughness. The depth of cut, by increasing the surface, is smoother.

30|$|Shrubs {{have been}} the focus of {{management}} in cases where there are both too few and too many. Whether fire is effective for increasing the cover of shrubs in areas where they are currently lacking will depend, in part, on the presence of seed in the soil. Conversely, the presence of seed in the soil can hamper the long-term effectiveness of some methods of controlling shrub abundance, such as mastication, <b>hand</b> <b>cutting,</b> or herbicides. Managing shrubs by manipulating the size of the seed bank with fire has also been suggested (Biswell et al. 1955, Weatherspoon 1988). Whether using fire is a viable strategy to manage shrub abundance in forests will depend on improved understanding of seed bank size, depth of seed burial, and how both are affected by fire under varying burning conditions.|$|R
