40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to broaden current knowledge of the strength and buckling/collapse of shells, with special reference to steel silo structures on discrete supports, and thus to provide design guidance of practical value for future silo design and construction and to develop new research aspects for further investigation. A linear elastic solution of the cylindrical shell bending equations is presented for local loadings, with special attention to local longitudinal distributed loadings. Algebraic expressions for the displacements and stresses induced by a rectangular patch of longitudinal load on a simply supported cylindrical shell are derived using double Fourier series. The solution of this problem is general, and therefore {{can be applied to}} cylindrical shells under local I loadings in any direction and with different boundary conditions. Linear elastic analyses of discretely supported perfect cylinders under axial compression are presented using the finite element method. The pre-buckling meridional membrane stress distribution above the support centreline is examined in detail, and is followed by investigations of the linear bifurcation behaviour of the cylinders. The effects on the stress distribution and the buckling strength of different loading patterns and different geometric configurations are extensively examined. Geometrically nonlinear elastic buckling analyses are also performed using large deflection theory. Both perfect and imperfect cylinders are studied with various geometric configurations and under different loading conditions. The nonlinear elastic buckling behaviour, the buckling strength and the buckling configuration are thoroughly investigated for discretely supported cylinders Further studies extend the work into the plastic range. Discretely supported cylinders obeying the von Mises yield criterion are analysed. Limit analyses of perfect cylinders are first conducted using small deflection theory. Geometrically nonlinear elastic-plastic collapse analyses of both perfect and imperfect cylinders are performed next. Studies of different loading conditions and parametric studies of varying geometries and material strengths are presented in both types of analysis. The nonlinear elastic-plastic behaviour of discretely supported cylinders is thus explored. A complete silo which consists of a cylindrical shell, a conical roof hopper and a conical <b>discharge</b> <b>hopper</b> is briefly examined, with the aim of exploring the applicability of the established cylinder model in the elastic buckling analysis of silo structures.

40|$|The {{majority}} of {{processes in the}} chemical and allied industries involve the storage and conveyancing of granular material, the physics of which is still not particularly well understood. Whilst some non-invasive techniques have been developed, much experimental work unfortunately interferes with the fields being investigated. For this reason and in conjunction with increasing computing power, {{there has been an}} increase in simulation based studies. Granular dynamics simulations, being based upon inter-particle interaction laws, give the potential to investigate assemblies at the "micro-level" and have been successful in modelling process conditions in a number of granular flow situations. To date, most analyses of these simulations are essentially static in nature involving "time snapshots". However, in a granular dynamics simulation there is a wealth of data available on a time referenced basis which has the potential to allow a quantitative analysis of the dynamics of assembly evolution. This dissertation describes the development and application of a toolkit for postsimulation analysis. However, the utilities within the toolkit would be equally applicable to large experimental data sets should such data sets exist. The application of the toolset focuses largely on the dynamics of heap evolution in both 2 D and 3 D with some supportive 3 D work on <b>hopper</b> <b>discharge.</b> A major part of the work involves the application of time series techniques (including the wavelet transform) in the context of variable coupling during avalanching. Segregation by self-diffusion receives particular attention and a new mechanism is proposed by which segregation by particle size takes place in the boundary layer of a low impact feed heap displaying a clear velocity gradient during discrete avalanching. Periodic lateral surging is shown to enforce mixing for a high impact feed, a phenomenon which appears to switch off below a certain feed impact. Segregation by self-diffusion is also shown to take place with the conical section of a 3 D <b>discharging</b> <b>hopper</b> (in the presence of a velocity gradient) which is in agreement with experimental studies. In the context of the discrete defining events which characterise the evolution of a granular assembly, the discrete wavelet transform is shown to be capable of identifying "time constants" in the absence of real periodicity. A flexible colour coded display capability (for both 2 D and 3 D) is shown to be helpful in investigating the dynamics in conjunction with the time series methods developed...|$|R

The large volume of off-gas discharged from the flash smelter is {{at a very high}} temperature (1350 °C) and contains a significant dust load that subjects the downstream waste-heat boiler to tough and demanding conditions. The boiler cavity is especially prone to dust accretions, fouling, and corrosion caused by accumulation of molten particles and precipitation of sulphuric acid. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) is applied within a qualitative study to model the flow and heat transfer distribution throughout the waste-heat boiler. The commercial CFD package, Fluent 6. 2. 16, was applied to a modified waste-heat boiler (23 m × 11 m × 5. 4 m) within the Outokumpu flash smelting process. This investigation focuses on the geometric modifications to the typical boiler design, which includes elevation of the ceiling, placement of flow-obstructing baffles and radiation plates parallel within the flow path. Also investigated were various boiler operating conditions such as the circulation of process off-gas, air leakage from the dust <b>discharging</b> <b>hoppers</b> and variation in inlet gas composition. The geometric modifications had the desired effect of increasing the volumetric utilization and therefore enhancing heat transfer between the boiler surface and the gas stream and dust segregation. Introducing circulated off-gas at a rate of 20 m/s and at a 45 ° angle {{to the front of the}} waste boiler further enhanced cooling while reducing the high impact of the furnace-uptake gas-stream on the boiler ceiling.

40|$|Bulk {{material}} handling operations involving a falling stream of particles are {{very common in}} industry throughout the world. In the process of bulk material transfer, fugitive dust may be generated and the surrounding air is entrained into the particle stream during free fall conditions. Understanding of how air entrainment by particles in free fall can assist {{in the design of}} effective dust control. However, at the commencement of this project, research in the field of air entrainment in a free falling particle stream was limited due to the shortage of theoretical analysis and experimental data reported in the literature. For this reason, the purpose of this thesis was to undertake detailed experimental work and to formulate a theoretical model to predict the volume of air entrainment by free falling particles as a function of material properties and process parameters. A series of experiments were performed to demonstrate the measurement methodology for air entrainment by free falling particles. To obtain detailed information on the characteristics of air entrainment and falling particle systems, a systematic experimental investigation was undertaken into the dynamics of a stream of particles and the associated entrained air flow. These experiments, were carried out to investigate the effects of material properties and material process parameters, such as mass flow rate of bulk material, particle size distribution, particle density, outlet size of the <b>discharging</b> <b>hopper</b> and particle drop height. A significant finding in the experimental work was that the core of free falling particles contracted immediately after exit from the outlet of a hopper, and thereafter maintained an approximately constant radius for a considerable height. However, the dilation of the bulk material was not homogeneous, and the core of the particle stream appeared to break up into different sizes and shapes of individual clouds. Eventually, these particle clouds tended to dissipate and the falling particles spread out with drop height. A mathematical model to predict the quantity of air entrainment in free falling particles was developed and numerical solutions obtained. Experiments were also conducted to determine the velocity profile of the entrained air flow. In the experimental investigation, the air entrainment constant was found to be varied with different bulk materials. The comparison {{of the results of the}} present study on the air entrainment in the particle plume and previous research indicated that the entrainment capability of the particle plume is less than that of miscible plumes, bubble plumes and droplet-driven spray flows...|$|R

The measured basic mechanical-physical properties of the individual mixtures have shown that starch improves flowability of the mixture (growing value of the ffc parameter), reduces impact of friction forces on the contact stainless material (reduced wall friction), thus reducing energy demands of the process as regards flow of the mixture through the hopper of a pellet press. High-speed camera simulations, which evaluate the immediate speed of particles during <b>discharge</b> of the <b>hopper,</b> have proved that addition of a material with different distribution of {{size and shape of}} the particles (starch) has a favourable effect on the overall flowability of the mixture. When pelletizing a mixture with starch, which has a lower angle of internal friction, the pelletizing pressure in the die is slightly lower and the resulting pellets have a slightly lower density. This feature is compensated by prevailing positive effects of the added starch on the pelletization, where the resulting pellets have higher durability, higher hardness and moisture resistance...|$|R
40|$|Hoppers {{are widely}} applied in process {{industries}} {{mainly because of}} their capacity to enhance the flow conditions for granular materials.

Rolling friction and cohesion nevertheless affected the simulated discharge rate in a similar manner, producing results comparable to those observed experimentally and calculated with the Beverloo equation.

The results are classified into three regimes: (i) granular flows with negligible interstitial fluid effects; (ii) flows affected by the presence of the interstitial fluid; and (iii) a no-flow region in which particles arch across the orifice and do not discharge. Within the fluid-affected region, the flows were visually classified as lubricated and air-coupled flows, oscillatory flows, channeling flows in which the flow preferentially rises along the sidewalls, and fluidized flows in which the upward flow suspends the particles. The discharge rates depends on the Archimedes number, the ratio of the effective hopper diameter to the particle diameter, and hourglass geometry. The hopper-discharge experiments, as well as experiments found in the literature, demonstrate that the presence of the interstitial fluid is important when the nondimensional ratio (N) of the single-particle terminal velocity to the <b>hopper</b> <b>discharge</b> velocity is less than 10. Flow ceased in all experiments in which the particle diameter was greater than 25 % of the effective hopper diameter regardless of the interstitial fluid...|$|R
40|$|The {{packing density}} and flat {{bottomed}} <b>hopper</b> <b>discharge</b> of non-convex polyhedral particles are investigated {{in a systematic}} experimental study. The motivation for this study is two-fold. Firstly, to establish an approach to deliver quality experimental particle packing data for non-convex polyhedral particles {{that can be used}} for characterization and validation purposes of discrete element codes. Secondly, to make the reproducibility of experimental setups as convenient and readily available as possible using affordable and accessible technology. The primary technology for this study is fused deposition modeling used to 3 D print polylactic acid (PLA) particles using readily available 3 D printer technology. A total of 8000 biodegradable particles were printed, 1000 white particles and 1000 black particles for each of the four particle types considered in this study. Reproducibility is one benefit of using fused deposition modeling to print particles, but an extremely important additional benefit is that specific particle properties can be explicitly controlled. As an example in this study the volume fraction of each particle can be controlled i. e. the effective particle density can be adjusted. In this study the particle volumes reduces drastically as the non-convexity is increased, however all printed white particles in this study have the same mass within 2 % of each other...|$|R
