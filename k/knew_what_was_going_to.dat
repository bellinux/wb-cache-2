5|$|From {{the start}} of the production, Atlus staff saw Shin Megami Tensei as a chance to create a game with the company's brand on it. The staff saw it as a remake of the {{previous}} Megami Tensei game; because of this, they <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen in the story, and the development went smoothly. The story went through multiple revisions, and many settings were inspired by the staff's personal lives. The character and demon designs were done by Kazuma Kaneko, who used mythical figures and multiple clothing styles in his designs. Reception and sales for the game have been highly positive, and its success helped launch Atlus as a developer and publisher, along with popularizing the Megami Tensei series.|$|E
25|$|Certainly, {{there are}} a number of stories {{sloshing}} around the news now that have raised discussions of Israel and of the posture of American Jews to an acrid level. The purveyor of anthrax may have been a former government scientist, Jewish, with a record of baiting a colleague of Arab origins, and with the intent to blame the anthrax on Muslim terrorists. Rocketing around the web and spilling into the press are many stories about Israeli spies in America at the time of 9/11. On various accounts, they were trailing Mohamed Atta and his associates, <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen but did nothing about it, or were simply spying on US facilities.|$|E

We're all separated and wandering the streets looking like it's the day after a funeral, with Ben {{in a suit and}} bare feet, and I'm never touching the ground. I'm sitting on a phone booth or lying on a car, to hint that I'm dead, that I'm singing from the dead. It's all about separation. It's almost like the director <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen, but he can't have known. It's just one of those fate things." ...|$|E

500|$|Originally to {{be called}} The Ends of the Earth, each episode would have ended with the planet Earth meeting its demise in a {{different}} way. While writing the first episode, Adams realised that he needed a character who <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen to Earth before the other characters. He made this character an alien and, remembering an idea he supposedly had had while lying drunk in a field in Innsbruck, Austria in 1971, decided that this character would be a [...] "roving reporter" [...] for The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, a pan-galactic encyclopedia and travel guide. Recollections by his friends at the time indicate that Adams first spoke {{of the idea of}} [...] "hitchhiking around the galaxy" [...] while on holiday in Greece in 1973.|$|E
500|$|When the two share another kiss, James told TV Week {{that there}} are [...] "a lot of complications" [...] for them. She said that no one <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen next and that Nicole felt guilty for betraying Belle because she was her friend. James {{explained}} that the pairing with Aden was [...] "a bit more serious and in-depth than Nicole's usual relationships." [...] James opined that Aden was also {{the one of the}} [...] "nicer guys" [...] for Nicole. When the pair embarked on a relationship. James opined that Aden and Nicole were great together and explained, [...] "they started out having a kind of brother-sister relationship, and that developed into something more." [...] Nicole declared her love for Aden early on in their romance, so he did not reciprocate the gesture. Lasance described the moment whilst interviewed by TV Week stating: [...] "They've always had an awesome connection and Nicole gets into a bit of a comfortable state and blurts out that she loves Aden." [...] Aden appreciated her love for him, however cannot say it back until he felt the same way. It is this that made their relationship [...] "awkward", Nicole tried to withdraw her declaration though Aden realises she meant it.|$|E
500|$|Nicole's {{best friend}} during her initial storylines was Aden Jefferies (Todd Lasance). After Brendan Austin (Kain O'Keeffe) caused Roman to go blind, {{he took his}} anger out on Nicole and Aden. Subsequently they became [...] "each other's support network" [...] and Lasance {{said it was not}} long {{afterward}} that they [...] "slipped between the sheets". One of the conditions of Aden's tenancy was to never sleep with Nicole, this made the pair feel guilty that they had deceived Roman. Lasance felt the storyline was controversial as he had a strong fan base for his relationship with Belle Taylor (Jessica Tovey) - which meant he knew it would [...] "cause a stir" [...] and divide the audience. In January2010, Nicole and Aden [...] "get up close and personal" [...] and they decided to spend Aden's remaining time in the Bay together. They shared a kiss and James told TV Week that there are [...] "a lot of complications" [...] for them. She said that no one <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen with Liam Murphy (Axle Whitehead) and that Nicole felt guilty for betraying Belle because she was her friend. James explained that Nicole's pairing with Aden was [...] "a bit more serious and in-depth than her usual relationships." [...] James opined that Aden was the [...] "nicer guy" [...] for Nicole, but Liam may have had [...] "the edge she's after." [...] Nicole and Aden then embarked on a relationship. James thought that Nicole and Aden's relationship was great and said [...] "They started out having a kind of brother-sister relationship, and that developed into something more." [...] Nicole declared her love for Aden, however he did not reciprocate. Lasance described the moment whilst interviewed by TV Week stating: [...] "They've always had an awesome connection and Nicole gets into a bit of a comfortable state and blurts out that she loves Aden." [...] Aden appreciated her love for him, however cannot say it back until he felt the same way. It is this that made their relationship [...] "awkward", Nicole tried to withdraw her declaration and hide her hurt feelings.|$|E

His vision, speed of thought and passing were on a different level; he always <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen before anybody else did. If anyone had a 'football brain', it was him." ...|$|E
2500|$|She {{helped the}} girls change into long white nightgowns. She then softly combed their hair. Misch tried to {{concentrate}} on his work but he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen. Magda then went {{back up to the}} Vorbunker with the children. Shortly thereafter, Werner Naumann came down to the Führerbunker and told Misch that he had seen Hitler's personal physician, Dr Stumpfegger give the children something [...] "sweetened" [...] to drink. About two hours later, Magda came back down to the Führerbunker, alone. She looked very pale, her eyes very red and her face was [...] "frozen". She sat down at a table and began playing patience. Goebbels then came over to her, but did not say a word at that time.|$|E
2500|$|... "No Sanctuary" [...] {{featured}} several homages {{to various}} horror films. The episode's opening scene involved primary characters Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Glenn Rhee, and Bob Stookey {{being brought to}} a slaughterhouse and lined up over a trough with other Terminus captives, who are violently hit {{over the head with}} baseball bats before their throats are slit to drain their blood. Nicotero said during an interview in the aftershow Talking Dead that the scene was inspired by the film Alien (1979), particularly the [...] "chestburster" [...] scene. [...] " [...] Ridley Scott they had blood tubes hooked up and nobody <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen...When they rolled six cameras and Veronica Cartwright gets hit with all the blood, all those reactions were real," [...] stated Nicotero, who also opted to use practical effects in filming and kept {{the true nature of the}} scene hidden from the actors. Another scene involved Rick's group escaping from the slaughterhouse and passing by several crates, one of which read: [...] "Arctic Expedition Horlicks University, Attn: Julia Carpenter". Nicotero, who usually inserts several Easter eggs in the episodes he directs, added this as an homage to the film Creepshow (1982) and its director, George A. Romero, who worked with Nicotero in Day of the Dead (1985).|$|E

2500|$|Ross and Urie {{soon began}} to commit to their laptops the demos they had been {{developing}} and posted three early demos ("Time to Dance," [...] "Nails for Breakfast, Tacks for Snacks" [...] and [...] "Camisado") on PureVolume. On a whim, they sent a link to Fall Out Boy bassist Pete Wentz via a LiveJournal account. Wentz, who was in Los Angeles at the time {{with the rest of}} Fall Out Boy working on the band's major-label debut, From Under the Cork Tree, drove to Las Vegas to meet with the young, unsigned band. Upon hearing [...] "two to three" [...] songs during band practice, Wentz was impressed and immediately wanted the band to sign to his Fueled by Ramen imprint label Decaydance Records, which made the band the first on the new label. Around December 2004, the group signed to the label. As news broke that Wentz had signed Panic! (who had yet to perform a single live show), fans on the Internet began to bash the group. [...] "Almost right away we <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen," [...] Ross explained in a 2006 interview. [...] "We had two songs online and people were already making assumptions on what kind of band we were and {{what we were going to}} sound like." ...|$|E

60|$|In {{the course}} of a week's {{practice}} Mark learned where to look for cheating; he could not indeed follow the fingers of his instructor, for even when he <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be done, the movements were so rapid that his eye could not follow them, and in nine cases out of ten he was unable to say whether the coup had been accomplished or not; but he could see that there was a slight movement of the fingers that could only mean that something was being done.|$|E
60|$|It was {{afternoon}} when all {{was ready for}} this race, and the sage was bright gray in the westering sun. Everybody was resting, waiting. The tense quiet of the riders seemed to settle upon the whole assemblage. Only the thoroughbreds were restless. They quivered and stamped and tossed their small, fine heads. They <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen. They wanted to run. Blacks, bays, and whites were the predominating colors; and the horses and mustangs were alike in those points of race and speed and spirit that proclaimed them thoroughbreds.|$|E

60|$|I had {{not been}} sitting there long before my {{attention}} became attracted {{to a man in}} a punt who, I noticed with some surprise, wore a jacket and cap exactly like mine. He was evidently a novice at punting, and his performance was most interesting. You never <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen when he put the pole in; he evidently did not know himself. Sometimes he shot up stream and sometimes he shot down stream, and at other times he simply spun round and came up {{the other side of the}} pole. And with every result he seemed equally surprised and annoyed.|$|E
60|$|Harding {{urged the}} horses, {{and as the}} wheels ran out on firm ground the pace grew faster, and a distant bluff began {{to rise from the}} waste. When they were a mile or two from the woods there was a rumble of thunder and the light grew dim. The dark sky seemed {{descending}} to meet the earth, the bluff grew indistinct, but the burned grass still retained its ghostly whiteness. Then the temperature suddenly fell, and when a puff of cold wind touched his face Harding used the whip. He <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] she cried, {{sitting down}} in a {{paroxysm}} of grief, but unable to weep. [...] "It is too late; and it is all your fault. What business had you to go away?

Oh, yes, poor girl! she need not trouble about that. I declare there is nothing viler, meaner, cowardlier, selfisher on earth than a man. Oh, if we had only done what we always said we would do--kept free from you!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Be so good as {{to let me}} <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>is</b> <b>going</b> on in the house," [...] he said to her, in a tone which, {{under the}} circumstances, he himself deemed genial.|$|R
