50|$|Since the 1970s, DC motors have {{declined}} in popularity; high end audiophile turntable designs use the synchronous motor, which are smoother running and lower noise.

Other methods at achieving stability include using optical sensors on the platter which feed back to the electronics; or use of <b>fly</b> <b>wheel</b> assemblies. Some manufacturers use mass to deal with the problem. Heavy platters, which have higher inertia, are thus less susceptible to minute speed variations. However, mass stores energy that may be difficult to control. Heavier platter also increases wear on the bearing.|$|E

The Holtzapffels developed ornamental turning lathes from the continuous revolution lathe combined with metal-working innovations like the automatic slide rest. These lathes worked from geared patterns to cut designs in hardwoods such as ebony. They were favored as a hobby by European princes, meriting a mention by Tolstoy in War and Peace (1869).|$|E

5000|$|Despite {{a series}} of {{financial}} scandals associated with the parent Chillagoe operation and the temporary closure of its smelters, Mungana continued to develop. The Lady Jane Mine was regarded as [...] "promising" [...] and in 1909 new plant was installed including a Babcock boiler. The Mungana Mining Co. installed a pumping plant at Girofla in 1911 {{that was one of}} the largest in Queensland at the time and required considerable supporting infrastructure. It consisted of a beam pump with a 39-foot sweep, a tandem compound engine with an 18 foot long crank shaft and a 9-ton weight <b>fly</b> <b>wheel</b> 18 foot in diameter. Like many of its contemporaries, Mungana had a reputation as a wild frontier township. The large number of men, physical isolation and tough living conditions resulted in frequent fights and drunkenness. In October 1901 a domestic servant named Hannah Treacy was murdered by a drunken miner, Richard Henderson, who soon after committed suicide. The offender is believed to occupy one of at least three graves rumoured to exist at the end of Main Street. A formal cemetery was established approximately two kilometres from the township in the early twentieth century, consisting of both marked and unmarked graves. The oldest known burial is dated 1904. The town racetrack was also located in this area and one of the cemetery fence posts was the fourth furlong marker.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new method {{to design and}} to determine the inertial moment of the <b>fly</b> <b>wheel,</b> according to the allowed maximum and minimum angular velocity. The advantage of this method is: {{in the same time}} of the dynamic analysis of the the mechanics we can fulfill the design of the <b>fly</b> <b>wheel.</b> With this method, the inertial moment of <b>fly</b> <b>wheel</b> is determined precisely. In the traditional method, first we have to determine the inertial moment of <b>fly</b> <b>wheel,</b> then, make static-dynamic analysis of the mechanism and find out the react force of the connect pair. For example, after work, one first goes home and then has to go shopping. But if we choose not to go home directly, while on the way home in passing do some shopping then go home. Even though it is not the shortest way, but in total we can shave time and rod. It is the same occasion with our design method too. Even though the process of calculation is more complicated than the formal method, but we can determine the reaction on the connect pair at the same time. So that in total decreased the amount of design work. 1 Introductions Flywheel {{is an important part of}} shaper machine tool.

40|$|International audienceThe capture {{dynamics}} of rotationally polarized homonuclear diatoms in lowenergy collisions with ions is studied theoretically. The interaction potential includes charge-quadrupole and charge-induced dipole terms. The former, {{taken in the}} perturbed rotor approximation, exhibits an R− 3 anisotropic dependence and causes an only gradual locking of the intrinsic angular momentum of the diatom to the collision axis. As a result, the capture occurs in a regime of incomplete locking, and the passage over centrifugal barriers is accompanied by considerable gyroscopic effects. The j-specific capture cross sections for rotationally-aligned diatoms show a marked dependence on the polarization state which is not described by the conventional adiabatic channel model. The latter, however, provides a fair approximation for the cross sections of unpolarized diatoms. These features are due to a considerable angle of rotation of the collision axis before the barrier is reached and to a small angle of rotation during the passage across the barrier. The numerically determined, scaled, capture cross sections are represented by an approximate analytical expression that interpolates between two limiting cases, very small (adiabatic channel model) and very large (<b>fly</b> <b>wheel</b> model) gyroscopic effects of the rotating diatom...|$|E
