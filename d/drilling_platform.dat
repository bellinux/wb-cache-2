25|$|In November 2011, Shell Oil Company {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} with Arctia Offshore and chartered the Finnish multipurpose icebreakers Fennica and Nordica to serve as primary ice management vessels in the Chukchi Sea during the summer seasons of 2012–2014. The primary purpose of Nordica was to protect the <b>drilling</b> <b>platform</b> Kulluk by steering large ice floes so that they don't endanger the drilling operation. The decision to charter the Finnish icebreakers to support Arctic offshore drilling was widely criticized due potential environmental damage in case of oil spill. On 16 March 2012, some 52 Greenpeace activists from five different countries boarded Fennica and Nordica at Arctech Helsinki Shipyard to protest Shell's drilling operations in Alaska. The protests continued on May Day when the 52 activists from 15 different countries tried again to prevent Nordica from leaving Helsinki. On 3 May, while Nordica was passing the Swedish island of Öland in the Baltic Sea, six Greenpeace activists boarded the icebreaker, forcing the vessel to stop at Karlskrona where the protesters were arrested by the Swedish police and coast guard. Finally, in the following night 14 activists forced Nordica to carry out evasive manoeuvres in the sea region between Denmark and Germany by stopping boats {{in the middle of}} the shipping lane in front of the icebreaker and even swimming in the sea.|$|E

2500|$|In the 1930s, as {{the pearl}} trade declined, {{interest}} {{grew in the}} oil possibilities of the region. On 5 January 1936, Petroleum Development (Trucial Coast) Ltd (PDTC), an associate company of the Iraq Petroleum Company, entered into a concession agreement with the ruler, Sheikh Shakhbut bin Sultan al Nahyan, to explore for oil. This {{was followed by a}} seventy-five-year concession signed in January 1939. However, owing to the desert terrain, inland exploration was fraught with difficulties. In 1953, D'Arcy Exploration Company, the exploration arm of BP, obtained an offshore concession which was then transferred to a company created to operate the concession: Abu Dhabi Marine Areas (ADMA) was a joint venture between BP and Compagnie Française des Pétroles (later Total).

50|$|As a result, {{all vessels}} {{engaged in the}} {{coastwise}} trade have been required to be coastwise-qualified (i.e., U.S.-built, owned and documented). Under the Passenger Vessel Services Act of 1886 (46 U.S.C. § 55103), non-coastwise-qualified vessels cannot transport passengers directly between U.S. ports. Generally, a passenger is any person carried on a vessel who is not directly and substantially connected with the operation of such vessel, her navigation, ownership, or business. The precise definition {{of what constitutes a}} U.S. port ("coastwise point") includes artificial islands and similar structures, as well as to mobile oil <b>drilling</b> rigs, <b>drilling</b> <b>platforms,</b> and other devices attached to the seabed of the Outer Continental Shelf for the purpose of resource exploration operations, and the anchored warehouse vessels that supply <b>drilling</b> <b>platforms.</b>|$|R
