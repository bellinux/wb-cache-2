5|$|Tute {{games are}} played until an {{established}} number of game points <b>is</b> <b>reached.</b> Each {{time one of}} the competitors wins a round, one point {{is added to the}} total score of the player or pair. New rounds are played until a player or pair reaches the game points goal (three and six point games are the most common). When the number <b>is</b> <b>reached</b> the player or pair wins.|$|E
5|$|All health {{policies}} {{sold in the}} United States {{must provide}} an annual maximum out of pocket (MOOP) payment cap for an individual's or family's medical expenses (excluding premiums). After the MOOP payment cap <b>is</b> <b>reached,</b> all remaining costs must be paid by the insurer.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{consisting}} {{mostly of}} hydrogen and helium, most of Saturn's mass {{is not in}} the gas phase, because hydrogen becomes a non-ideal liquid when the density is above 0.01g/cm3, which <b>is</b> <b>reached</b> at a radius containing 99.9% of Saturn's mass. The temperature, pressure, and density inside Saturn all rise steadily toward the core, which causes hydrogen to be a metal in the deeper layers.|$|E
50|$|Simon Tatham and Gareth Taylor {{have shown}} that the fifth row can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> via an {{infinite}} series of moves http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/solarmy/; this result is also in a paper by Pieter Blue and Stephen Hartke http://www.math.unl.edu/~shartke2/. If diagonal jumps are allowed, the 8th row can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> but not the 9th row. It has also been shown that, in the n-dimensional version of the game, the highest row that can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> <b>is</b> 3n-2. Conway's weighting argument demonstrates that the row 3n-1 cannot <b>be</b> <b>reached.</b> It <b>is</b> considerably harder to show that row 3n-2 can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> (see the paper by Eriksson and Lindstrom).|$|R
50|$|It {{can also}} <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> {{toll-free}} at 800-272-3900. The 24-hour helpline can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> {{at any of}} these numbers.|$|R

5|$|Lanthanum reacts exothermically with {{hydrogen}} {{to produce}} the dihydride LaH2, a black, pyrophoric, brittle, conducting compound with the calcium fluoride structure. This is a non-stoichiometric compound, and further absorption of hydrogen is possible, with a concomitant loss of electrical conductivity, until the more salt-like LaH3 <b>is</b> <b>reached.</b> Like LaI2 and LaI, LaH2 is probably an electride compound.|$|E
5|$|The A303 is {{of a lower}} {{standard}} west of Ilminster and is {{no longer}} considered part of the strategic road network. It passes through the Blackdown Hills as a narrow road following the contours of the land. The end of the A303 <b>is</b> <b>reached</b> where it joins the A30, which enters as a side road and continues as the main route forward for Honiton and Exeter.|$|E
5|$|The Gatehouse <b>is</b> <b>reached</b> {{across a}} wooden bridge, {{incorporating}} a drawbridge. Burges intended {{the bridge to}} copy those of medieval castles, which he believed were designed to be easily set on fire {{in the event of}} attack. The Gatehouse was fitted with a wooden defensive bretache and, above the entrance, Burges sited a portcullis and a glazed statue of the Madonna and Child sculpted by Ceccardo Fucigna.|$|E

5|$|A {{fusible plug}} is a {{threaded}} metal cylinder usually of bronze, brass or gunmetal, with a tapered hole drilled completely through its length. This hole is sealed {{with a metal}} {{of low melting point}} that flows away if a pre-determined, high temperature <b>is</b> <b>reached.</b> The initial use of the fusible plug was as a safety precaution against low water levels in steam engine boilers, but later applications extended its use to other closed vessels, such as air conditioning systems and tanks for transporting corrosive or liquefied petroleum gasses.|$|E
5|$|Above the Arctic Circle, {{an extreme}} case <b>is</b> <b>reached</b> {{where there is}} no {{daylight}} at all for part of the year, up to six months at the North Pole itself, a polar night. In the Southern Hemisphere, the situation is exactly reversed, with the South Pole oriented opposite the direction of the North Pole. Six months later, this pole will experience a midnight sun, a day of 24 hours, again reversing with the South Pole.|$|E
5|$|After {{passing the}} site of Ty Dwr the railway bends around 'Amen' corner and soon after the Village Incline <b>is</b> <b>reached.</b> From here the line runs into the gorge, high above the river on a narrow ledge, ending {{at the foot of}} the first incline leading to the Bryn Eglwys quarry. The {{original}} line fanned out into a set of three sidings, used to marshal trains of loaded slate wagons coming down from the quarry and empty wagons waiting to ascend. Nant Gwernol station, the eastern terminus of the line, was built on {{the site of}} the sidings.|$|E
5000|$|All {{together}} the Les Cheneaux Islands {{are made up}} of 36 islands. However, only two can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> by car the rest can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> by boat. Hessel can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> by car but taking a boat is another option. The Mackinac Ferry provides transportation from Mackinaw City to Hessel and back.|$|R

5|$|Although hieroglyphic text may be {{laid out}} in varying manners, {{generally}} text is arranged into double columns of glyph blocks. The reading order of text starts at the top left (block A1), continues to the second block in the double-column (B1), then drops down a row and starts again from the left half of the double column (A2), and thus continues in zig-zag fashion. Once the bottom <b>is</b> <b>reached,</b> the inscription continues from the top left of the next double column. Where an inscription ends in a single (unpaired) column, this final column is usually read straight downwards.|$|E
5|$|Another {{option is}} to {{classify}} selection by the life cycle stage at which it acts. Some biologists recognise just two types: viability (or survival) selection, which acts to increase an organism's probability of survival, and fecundity (or fertility or reproductive) selection, which acts to increase the rate of reproduction, given survival. Others split the life cycle into further components of selection. Thus viability and survival selection may be defined separately and respectively as acting to improve the probability of survival before and after reproductive age <b>is</b> <b>reached,</b> while fecundity selection may be split into additional sub-components including sexual selection, gametic selection, acting on gamete survival, and compatibility selection, acting on zygote formation.|$|E
5|$|As the {{landscape}} rises, trees become {{smaller and more}} sparse, with stands broken by areas of exposed granite. These include lodgepole pine, whitebark pine, and mountain hemlock that, at highest elevations, give way to vast expanses of granite as treeline <b>is</b> <b>reached.</b> The climate in these habitats is harsh and the growing season is short, but species such as pika, yellow-bellied marmot, white-tailed jackrabbit, Clark's nutcracker, and black rosy finch are adapted to these conditions. Also, the treeless alpine habitats are the areas favored by Sierra Nevada bighorn sheep. This species, however, is now found in the Yosemite area only around Tioga Pass, where a small, reintroduced population exists.|$|E

5|$|Aside {{from the}} usual {{tactical}} aspects of racing, Wipeout 2097 (unlike its predecessor) offered the chance to eliminate other drivers from the competition by destroying their craft with weapons. Each craft has a shield energy quota, and when this quota reaches zero—either from damage sustained from weapon attacks, or impact from other craft or {{the edges of the}} circuit—the craft blows up. The craft also blows up if the time limit <b>is</b> <b>reached,</b> though this only applies to human players. The biggest weapon introduced in 2097 was the Quake Disruptor, which has been a series hallmark ever since. This weapon causes a quake to thrust a destructive wave down the track that dunks the crafts it smash into.|$|E
5|$|Capsize is {{the word}} used to {{describe}} a bike falling over without oscillation. During capsize, an uncontrolled front wheel usually steers {{in the direction of}} lean, but never enough to stop the increasing lean, until a very high lean angle <b>is</b> <b>reached,</b> at which point the steering may turn in the opposite direction. A capsize can happen very slowly if the bike is moving forward rapidly. Because the capsize instability is so slow, on the order of seconds, it is easy for the rider to control, and is actually used by the rider to initiate the lean necessary for a turn.|$|E
5|$|Catholic {{doctrine}} {{has developed}} over the centuries, reflecting direct teachings of early Christians, formal definitions of heretical and orthodox beliefs by ecumenical councils and in papal bulls, and theological debate by scholars. The Church believes that it is continually guided by the Holy Spirit as it discerns new theological issues and is protected infallibly from falling into doctrinal error when a firm decision on an issue <b>is</b> <b>reached.</b>|$|E
50|$|Puerto La Cruz {{has several}} ports from which many destinations, attractions and {{shopping}} facilities can <b>be</b> <b>reached.</b> Margarita Island can <b>be</b> <b>reached</b> through the transport service {{operated by the}} companies Conferry and Gran Cacique Express (which resumed its activities in December 2006).

5|$|Cave 2 {{is above}} {{and to the}} east of Cave1 and faces north. It was created in late 6th or early 7th century. It is smaller than Cave 1, {{somewhat}} similar in terms of its floor plan, but it is dedicated primarily to Vishnu. Cave2 <b>is</b> <b>reached</b> by climbing 64 steps from the first cave. The cave entrance is a verandah divided by four square pillars with ends as half pillars, all carved out of the monolithic stone face. The pillars have decorative carvings with frieze of ganas (mythical dwarfs) with various facial expressions. On {{the two sides of the}} entrance are standing dvarapalas (guardians) holding flowers, not weapons. Like Cave1, Cave 2 art reflects Hindu theology and arts.|$|E
5|$|Compared to Final Fantasy XI, where party-based {{gameplay}} is forefront at all times, the gameplay in XIV is adjusted so {{that players}} {{can go for}} longer periods without joining a party. There is no auto-attack option, with each action needing a manual input while an enemy is targeted. Each action uses up a stamina bar. Through defeating monsters, crafting items, and completing quests, players accumulate EXP which, when a certain threshold <b>is</b> <b>reached,</b> automatically increments the player's level. The player's level affects attributes such as HP (health/hit points), MP (magic/mana points), {{and the number of}} abilities available to them.|$|E
5|$|Diving {{cylinders}} {{are filled}} by attaching a high-pressure gas {{supply to the}} cylinder valve, opening the valve and allowing gas to flow into the cylinder until the desired pressure <b>is</b> <b>reached,</b> then closing the valves, venting the connection and disconnecting it. This process involves a risk of the cylinder or the filling equipment failing under pressure, {{both of which are}} hazardous to the operator, so procedures to control these risks are generally followed.|$|E
