Power to identify causal variants in these groups beyond a statistical significance threshold is challenging due to {{small sample size}} and/or lack of family information. There {{is a need to}} develop novel methods to identify NS-associated variants. One way to determine putative functional relevance of a gene is to measure its strength of negative selection, as variants in genes under strong negative selection {{are more likely to be}} deleterious. We created a gene-level, integrated metric of negative selection (GIMS) score for 20, 079 genes by combining multiple comparative genomics and population genetics measures. To understand the utility of GIMS for NS gene discovery, we examined this score in a diverse set of NS-relevant gene sets. These included genes known to cause monogenic forms of NS in humans as well as genes expressed in the cells of the glomerulus and, particularly, the podocyte. We found strong negative selection in the following NS-relevant gene sets: (1) autosomal-dominant Mendelian focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) <b>genes</b> (<b>p</b> = 0. 03 compared to reference), (2) glomerular expressed <b>genes</b> (<b>p</b> = 4 × 10 - 23), and (3) predicted podocyte <b>genes</b> (<b>p</b> = 3 × 10 - 9).

40|$|The class I {{molecules}} of the murine {{major histocompatibility complex}} (MHC), the H- 2 complex, are of utmost importance in the recognition of self vs. nonself, and in the regulation of the immune response. In recent years, {{a great deal of}} interest has centered {{on the role of the}} MHC in nonimmune phenomena. Among these traits are those associated with reproduction and development. We have shown that a <b>gene,</b> <b>Ped</b> (preimplantation embryo development) is associated with the H- 2 complex. <b>Ped</b> <b>gene</b> expression is apparent at the first cleavage division and affects the rate of subsequent cleavages. Therefore, the <b>Ped</b> <b>gene</b> product, whose nature is unknown, must be expressed at this time. It is possible that the <b>Ped</b> <b>gene</b> product is a class I molecule of the H- 2 complex, and that the control of the rate of development is one of the many pleiotrophic effects of these cell surface molecules. The first goal of this dissertation was the development of a highly sensitive assay to detect class I antigens on the embryo cell surface. Using this assay, we have followed the expression of several MHC antigens during early embryo development. The de novo synthesis of MHC molecules by the embryos was proven by stripping the proteins off the cell surface with enzymes and measuring the reappearance of the antigens. One of the class I MHC antigens was purified and used in blocking studies to further confirm the presence of class I antigens on the embryonic cell surface;The second goal of this dissertation was to map the <b>Ped</b> <b>gene</b> within the mouse MHC.

The viral DNA is found in the nucleus soon after infection of the cell. The partially double-stranded DNA is rendered fully double-stranded by completion of the (+) sense strand and removal of a protein molecule from the (−) sense strand and a short sequence of RNA from the (+) sense strand. Non-coding bases are removed from the ends of the (−) sense strand and the ends are rejoined. There are four known genes encoded by the genome, called C, X, P, and S.

40|$|UV radiation-induced {{mutation}} of the <b>p</b> 53 <b>gene</b> {{is suggested}} as a causative event in skin cancer, including melanoma. We have analyzed here p 53 mutations in melanoma cell lines and studied its stabilization, DNA-binding activity, and target gene activation by UVC. p 53 was mutated {{in three of}} seven melanoma cell lines. However, high levels of p 53 were detected in all cell lines, including melanoma cells with wild-type p 53, {{with the exception of}} one line with a truncated form. Upon UV induction, p 53 accumulated in lines with wild-type p 53, and <b>p</b> 53 target <b>genes</b> <b>p</b> 21 Cip 1 /Waf 1, GADD 45, and mdm 2 were induced, but the induction of p 21 Cip 1 /Waf 1 was significantly delayed as compared with the increase in p 53 DNA-binding activity. However, despite <b>p</b> 53 target <b>gene</b> induction, <b>p</b> 53 DNA-binding activity was absent in one melanoma line with wild-type p 53, and <b>p</b> 53 target <b>genes</b> were induced also in cells with mutant p 53. In response to UV, DNA replication ceased in all cell lines, and apoptosis ensued in four lines independently of p 53 but correlated with high induction of GADD 45. The results suggest that in melanoma, several p 53 regulatory steps are dislodged; its basal expression is high, its activation in response to UV damage is diminished, and the regulation of its target <b>genes</b> <b>p</b> 21 Cip 1 /Waf 1 and GADD 45 are dissociated from p 53 regulation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background While the {{function}} of the phosphoprotein (<b>P)</b> <b>gene</b> of the rabies virus (RABV) has been well studied in laboratory adapted RABVs, the genetic diversity and evolution characteristics of the <b>P</b> <b>gene</b> of street RABVs remain unclear. The objective {{of the present study was}} to investigate the mutation and evolution of <b>P</b> <b>genes</b> in Chinese street RABVs. Results The <b>P</b> <b>gene</b> of 77 RABVs from brain samples of dogs and wild animals collected in eight Chinese provinces through 2003 to 2008 were sequenced. The open reading frame (ORF) of the <b>P</b> <b>genes</b> was 894 nucleotides (nt) in length, with 85 - 99 % (80 - 89 %) amino acid (nucleotide) identity compared with the laboratory RABVs and vaccine strains. Phylogenetic analysis based on the <b>P</b> <b>gene</b> revealed that Chinese RABVs strains could be divided into two distinct clades, and several RABV variants were found to co circulating in the same province. Two conserved (CD 1, 2) and two variable (VD 1, 2) domains were identified by comparing the deduced primary sequences of the encoded P proteins. Two sequence motifs, one believed to confer binding to the cytoplasmic dynein light chain LC 8 and a lysine-rich sequence were conserved throughout the Chinese RABVs. In contrast, the isolates exhibited lower conservation of one phosphate acceptor and one internal translation initiation site identified in the P protein of the rabies challenge virus standard (CVS) strain. Bayesian coalescent analysis showed that the <b>P</b> <b>gene</b> in Chinese RABVs have a substitution rate (3. 305 x 10 - 4 substitutions per site per year) and evolution history (592 years ago) similar to values for the glycoprotein (G) and nucleoprotein (N) reported previously. Conclusion Several substitutions were found in the <b>P</b> <b>gene</b> of Chinese RABVs strains compared to the laboratory adapted and vaccine strains, whether these variations could affect the biological characteristics of Chinese RABVs need to be further investigated. The substitution rate and evolution history of <b>P</b> <b>gene</b> is similar to G and N gene, combine the topology of phylogenetic tree based on the <b>P</b> <b>gene</b> is similar to the G and N gene trees, indicate that the P, G and N genes are equally valid for examining the phylogenetics of RABVs. </p...|$|R
