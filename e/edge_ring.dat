The {{conformation}} of a flat 2D planar hexagon has considerable angle strain because its bonds are not 109.5 degrees; the torsional strain would also be considerable because all of the bonds would be eclipsed bonds. Therefore, to reduce torsional strain, cyclohexane adopts a three-dimensional structure known as the chair conformation. There are also two other intermediate conformers; half chair, which is the most unstable conformer, and twist boat, which is more stable than the boat conformer. This was first proposed as early as 1890 by Hermann Sachse, but only gained widespread acceptance much later. The new conformation puts the carbons at an angle of 109.5°. Half of the hydrogens are in the plane of the ring (equatorial) while the other half are perpendicular to the plane (axial). This conformation allows for the most stable structure of cyclohexane. Another conformation of cyclohexane exists, known as boat conformation, but it interconverts to the slightly more stable chair formation. If cyclohexane is mono-substituted with a large substituent, then the substituent will most likely be found attached in an equatorial position, as this is the slightly more stable conformation.|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe generalize proper {{coloring}} of gain graphs {{to totally}} frustrated states, where each vertex takes a {{value in a}} set of ‘qualities’ or ‘spins’ that is permuted by the gain group. In standard coloring the group acts trivially or regularly on each orbit (an example is the Potts model), but in the generalization the action is unrestricted. We show that the number of totally frustrated states satisfies a deletion–contraction law. It is not matroidal except in standard coloring, but it does have a formula in terms of fundamental groups of edge subsets. One can generalize chromatic polynomials by constructing spin sets out of repeated orbits. The dichromatic and Whitney-number polynomials of standard coloring generalize to evaluations of an abstract partition function that lives in the <b>edge</b> <b>ring</b> of the gain graph...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to investigate the dynamic behaviour of cable networks, in terms of their natural frequencies and the corresponding vibration modes. A multi-degree-of-freedom cable net model is assumed, having circular plan view and the shape of a hyperbolic paraboloid surface. The cable supports are considered either rigid or flexible, thus accounting for the deformability, of the <b>edge</b> <b>ring.</b> On the basis of numerical analyses, empirical formulae are proposed for the estimation of the linear natural frequencies, taking into account the mechanical and geometrical characteristics of the cable net and the ring, expressed in the form of appropriate non-dimensional parameters. The sequence of the symmetric and antisymmetric modes of the network and the occurrence of modal transition can be predicted in relation to one of these parameters, in analogy to single cables. The differences between a network with rigid cable supports and one with boundary ring, concerning the eigenmodes and the corresponding eigenfrequencies are identified. (C) 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

My first concern was with the choice of material available to the builder. Since most domes built today are constructed of either concrete, steel or wood, I need to determine which material would prove to be the most attractive. In order that all support columns are spaced the correct distance apart, I needed to verify the components that are used in computing this distance.

Ringing artifacts were already observed by Vija et al. in their early study of Flash 3 D [34]. The artifact intensities appeared to be system- and phantom-dependent. For the two General Electric cameras, uniformity artifacts were also present, and they could have obscured some other artifacts. It is very {{interesting to note that}} the uniformity artifacts were not observed when the images were reconstructed with FBP or 2 D OSEM (without resolution compensation). This indicates that the use of reconstruction algorithms with resolution recovery implies a revision of the acquisition parameters, and particularly the total number of acquired counts, of the procedures used to generate the uniformity correction matrix. As an example, Vija et al. [34] mentioned the use of very-high-count (up to 0.8 billion) floods for uniformity correction of data reconstructed with Flash 3 D. With Symbia T 6, a few SPECT acquisitions of the uniform phantoms were conducted with an elliptical orbit in addition to the circular orbit, and the <b>edge</b> <b>ring</b> artifact was elliptically shaped (Figure 5).
