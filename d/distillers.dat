5|$|The {{resistance}} came to {{a climax}} in 1794. In May of that year, federal district attorney William Rawle issued subpoenas for more than 60 <b>distillers</b> in Pennsylvania who had not paid the excise tax. Under the law then in effect, <b>distillers</b> who received these writs would be obligated to travel to Philadelphia to appear in federal court. For farmers on the western frontier, such a journey was expensive, time-consuming, and beyond their means. At the urging of William Findley, Congress modified this law on June 5, 1794, allowing excise trials {{to be held in}} local state courts. But by that time, U.S. marshal David Lenox had already been sent to serve the writs summoning delinquent <b>distillers</b> to Philadelphia. Attorney General William Bradford later maintained that the writs were meant to compel compliance with the law, and that the government did not actually intend to hold trials in Philadelphia.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Western Pennsylvania counties, protesters used {{violence}} and intimidation to prevent federal officials from collecting the tax. Resistance {{came to a}} climax in July 1794, when a U.S. marshal arrived in western Pennsylvania to serve writs to <b>distillers</b> who had not paid the excise. The alarm was raised, and more than 500 armed men attacked the fortified home of tax inspector General John Neville. Washington responded by sending peace commissioners to western Pennsylvania {{to negotiate with the}} rebels, {{while at the same time}} calling on governors to send a militia force to enforce the tax. Washington himself rode at the head of an army to suppress the insurgency, with 13,000 militiamen provided by the governors of Virginia, Maryland, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania. The rebels all went home before the arrival of the army, and there was no confrontation. About 20 men were arrested, but all were later acquitted or pardoned. Most <b>distillers</b> in nearby Kentucky were found to be all but impossible to tax—in the next six years, over 175 <b>distillers</b> from Kentucky were convicted of violating the tax law. Numerous examples of resistance are recorded in court documents and newspaper accounts.|$|E

40|$|<b>Distiller’s</b> grains are {{the primary}} {{coproduct}} derived from fuel ethanol production. As the fuel ethanol industry expands into the High Plains, <b>distiller’s</b> grains are becoming increasingly available as an alternative feed for livestock. Optimizing the use of <b>distiller’s</b> grains in flaked grain rations is important to maintaining a competitive advantage among feedlot producers in this region. Because <b>distiller’s</b> grains are relatively high in fiber, {{it is conceivable that}} the level of roughages in feedlot diets could be reduced when <b>distiller’s</b> grains are fed to cattle. Roughages normally have low energy density; therefore, the cost per unit of energy from roughages usually is relatively high compared with cereal grains or grain co-products. If the use of <b>distiller’s</b> grains would allow roughage levels to be decreased in finishing diets without deleterious consequences for health or performance, this generally would be viewed as a positive attribute. Our objective was to evaluate performance of feedlot cattle fed diets with and without <b>distiller’s</b> grains, and assess the effect of reducing the level of added roughage in diets containing <b>distiller’s</b> grains...|$|R

5|$|Opposition {{initially}} {{came from}} Pennsylvania's House of Representatives protesting the tax. William Maclay had noted {{that not even}} the Pennsylvanian legislators {{had been able to}} enforce excise taxes in the western regions of the state. Hamilton was aware of the potential difficulties and proposed inspectors the ability to search buildings that <b>distillers</b> were designated to store their spirits, and would be able to search suspected illegal storage facilities to confiscate contraband with a warrant. Although the inspectors were not allowed to search houses and warehouses, they were to visit twice a day and file weekly reports in extensive detail. Hamilton cautioned against expedited judicial means, and favored a jury trial with potential offenders. As soon as 1791 locals began to shun or threaten inspectors, as they felt the inspection methods were intrusive. Inspectors were also tarred and feathered, blindfolded, and whipped. Hamilton had attempted to appease the opposition with lowered tax rates, but it did not suffice.|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Animal Sciences and IndustryJames S. DrouillardA {{series of}} five trials were {{conducted}} to evaluate grain processing, <b>distiller's</b> grains inclusion in finishing diets, interactions between <b>distiller's</b> grains and dry-rolled corn (DRC) or steam-flaked corn (SFC), efficacy of removing roughage {{in the presence of}} <b>distiller's</b> grains and the digestibility of <b>distiller's</b> grains in steam-flaked and dry-rolled corn diets. The first trial was designed to determine the optimum flake density of SFC in beef finishing diets. Diets consisted of corn flaked to densities of 360, 411, or 462 g/L. Observed improvements in mill production would support increasing flake density; however numerical decreases in animal performance offset economic benefits of increased productivity. The second trial was conducted to evaluate optimum levels of sorghum wet <b>distiller's</b> grains in finishing diets. Crossbred yearling steers were fed diets containing DRC or SFC and levels of <b>distiller's</b> grains were 0, 10, 20, or 30 % of diet dry matter. <b>Distiller's</b> grains can effectively replaced a portion of the corn in finishing diets, but their nutritional value was greater in DRC diets than in SFC diets. In trial 3, crossbred heifers were fed diets containing SFC with 0 % DDG and 15 % corn silage (CS), 25 % DDG and 15 % CS, or 25 % DDG and 5 % CS. In trial 4, crossbreed heifers were fed diets similar containing DRC or SFC with 0 % DDG and 15 % CS, 25 % DDG and 15 % CS, or 25 % DDG and 5 % CS. Results indicate that roughage levels can be reduced in feedlot diets containing DDG with no adverse effects on performance or carcass quality. The fifth trial was a metabolism study conducted to evaluate the digestibility of DDG in beef cattle. Treatments consisted of DRC with 0 % DDG, DRC with 25 % DDG, SFC with 0 % DDG, and SFC with 25 % DDG. There were no significant grain processing by <b>distiller's</b> grain interactions observed in main effects. In conclusion optimum flake density was 360 g/L, feeding <b>distiller's</b> grains has a greater value in DRC diets vs. SFC diets, roughage level and type are important in formulating finishing diets, roughage can be reduced when feeding <b>distiller's</b> grains, and ruminal ammonia, and pH are decreased and ruminal lactate is increased when feeding DDG and SFC...|$|R

40|$|<b>Distiller’s</b> grains {{have been}} used {{extensively}} in the U. S. Corn Belt, where producers commonly feed dry-rolled or highmoisture corn. Fuel ethanol production is expanding into the High Plains, where most feedlots flake grain. Compared with dry- rolled corn, steam-flaked corn usually increases or has no change in average daily gain, yields lower dry matter intake and results in 12 to 16 % improvement in efficiency. Previous research at Kansas State University and elsewhere suggests {{that the value of}} <b>distiller’s</b> grains is different in flaked grain diets than in dry-rolled diets. We think this might be due to lower rumen pH when flaked grains are fed, perhaps reducing digestibility of the diet, especially the fibrous components. Because <b>distiller’s</b> grains contain considerable amounts of fiber, {{it might be possible to}} add less roughage to finishing diets that contain <b>distiller’s</b> grains, and doing so, improve efficiency...|$|R
5|$|Other {{aspects of}} the excise law also caused concern. The law {{required}} all stills to be registered, and those cited for failure to pay the tax had to appear in distant Federal, rather than local courts. The only Federal courthouse was in Philadelphia, some 300 {{miles away from the}} small frontier settlement of Pittsburgh. From the beginning, the Federal government had little success in collecting the whiskey tax along the frontier. Many small western <b>distillers</b> simply refused to pay the tax. Federal revenue officers and local residents who assisted them bore the brunt of the protester's ire. Tax rebels harassed several whiskey tax collectors and threatened or beat those who offered them office space or housing. As a result, many western counties never had a resident Federal tax official.|$|E
5|$|Randall {{worked with}} Republicans {{to shift the}} source of federal funds from taxes to tariffs. He {{believed}} the taxation of alcohol spread the burdens of taxation unfairly, especially as concerned his constituents, who included several <b>distillers.</b> He also believed the income tax, first enacted during the Civil War, was being administered unfairly, with large refunds often accruing to powerful business interests. On this point, Randall was successful, and the House accepted an amendment that required all cases for refunds over $500 to be tried before a federal district court. He also worked toward the elimination of taxation on tea, coffee, cigars, and matches, all of which Randall believed fell disproportionately on the poor. Relief from taxation made these items cheaper for the average American, while increasing reliance on tariffs helped the industrial owners and workers in Randall's district, as it made foreign products more expensive.|$|E
5|$|Grant {{replaced}} Richardson as Treasury Secretary with Benjamin H. Bristow, a {{man known}} for his honesty, who {{began a series of}} reforms in the department. Since the Civil War, whiskey <b>distillers</b> and corrupt treasury agents falsified figures on the amount of liquor produced, while certifying bogus returns, denying the treasury of revenue. Discovering that millions of gallons of whiskey escaped taxation, and having Grant's endorsement to act ("Let no guilty man escape"), Bristow in May 1875 struck at the Whiskey Ring. He ordered federal marshals to seize 32 installations and arrest 350 men; Bristow obtained 176 indictments that led to 110 convictions, and giving $3,150,000 to the Treasury. Bristow's investigation implicated Babcock and Missouri treasury agent John McDonald as part of the Whiskey Ring. When informed on separate occasions, Grant became defensive concerning Babcock, but concerning McDonald, the ringleader, Grant believed he had been betrayed. In 1876, a jury acquitted Babcock at a trial influenced by Grant's deposition in Babcock's favor. After the trial, Grant dismissed Babcock from the White House. Grant freed some Ring members after a few months in prison, including McDonald, released after serving 17 months in jail.|$|E

5|$|Illicit distilleries were commonplace {{throughout}} the Speyside area from medieval times but were largely made redundant {{with the passing}} of the Excise Act in 1823. It was under this legislation that legal distilleries could be formed, subject to holding a license. Alexander Gordon, 4th Duke of Gordon, was allegedly instrumental in the passing of this legislation. Although there is no historical record of his involvement in the issue, his tenant, George Smith, who was operating an illicit distillery at the time, became the first person in Glenlivet to apply for and receive a license to legally produce spirit. This would prove to be an unpopular decision; every other distiller was operating illegally at the time and hoping the new Excise Act would be repealed, something which would not happen if some <b>distillers</b> accepted the new law. Threats were made against George Smith, so George Gordon provided Smith with two pistols to be used to ensure both his own safety and that of the distillery. In 1824, The Glenlivet distillery was established at Upper Drumin by George and his youngest son John Gordon Smith.|$|E

In this study, <b>distiller's</b> grain price discovery dynamics are evaluated to develop an understanding of spatial price relationships. The knowledge of price relationships reveals that users of <b>distiller's</b> grain should shop around when procuring the feedstuff. Additionally, because animal performance may be altered with increased inclusion of <b>distiller's</b> grains, regional competitive advantages could shift fed cattle production to geographic regions characterized by high of ethanol production plants.
