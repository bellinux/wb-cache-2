5|$|In March 1945, the WSA {{offered a}} payment of $565,910 to American-Hawaiian for Pennsylvanian {{as part of}} a $7.2 million {{settlement}} for eleven requisitioned American-Hawaiian ships that had <b>either</b> <b>been</b> sunk, scuttled, or were to be retained by the government.|$|E
5|$|As {{in other}} pet species, {{a variety of}} colors, coat types, and other {{features}} that do {{not appear in the}} wild have <b>either</b> <b>been</b> developed, or have appeared spontaneously. Any individual rat may be defined one or more ways by its color, coat, marking, and non-standard body type. This allows for very specific classifications such as a ruby-eyed cinnamon Berkshire rex Dumbo.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} mammals, {{domestic}} sheep reproduction occurs sexually. Their reproductive strategy {{is very similar}} to other domestic herd animals. A flock of sheep is generally mated by a single ram, which has <b>either</b> <b>been</b> chosen by a farmer or has established dominance through physical contest with other rams (in feral populations). Most sheep have a breeding season (tupping) in the autumn, though some are able to breed year-round.|$|E

5000|$|There is no {{standard}} orthography. Broadly speaking, Shelta can <b>either</b> <b>be</b> written {{following an}} Irish-type orthography or an English-type orthography. For example, {{the word for}} [...] "married" [...] can <b>either</b> <b>be</b> spelled lósped or lohsped, a [...] "woman" [...] can <b>either</b> <b>be</b> spelled byohr or beoir.|$|R

5|$|In March 1945, the WSA {{offered a}} payment of $565,910 to American-Hawaiian for Kentuckian {{as part of}} a $7.2 million {{settlement}} for eleven requisitioned American-Hawaiian ships that had <b>either</b> <b>been</b> sunk, scuttled (like Kentuckian), or were to be retained by the government.|$|E
5|$|Plans {{to further}} extend the freeway have <b>either</b> <b>been</b> {{canceled}} or placed back under study. Upgrades {{on the north}} end through Kalkaska ceased {{to be considered in}} 2000. South of Three Rivers, MDOT is studying possible upgrades to US131. One option for these upgrades is a full freeway, an option that was initially rejected. The preferred alternative in 2008 was a two-lane bypass of Constantine that opened in October 2013.|$|E
5|$|Several notable {{companies}} have <b>either</b> <b>been</b> founded or had their headquarters in Princes Street. Notable among these were The Drapery and General Importing Company of New Zealand, later simply known as The D.I.C., Hallenstein's, and H.E. Shacklock. The first New Zealand headquarters of Briscoes were also located on Princes Street.|$|E
50|$|Alternative classifications are {{provided}} for some groups, {{in which a}} number of families can <b>either</b> <b>be</b> regarded as separate or can be merged into a single larger family.

5|$|The final attack {{had cost}} the 12th Parachute Battalion 126 killed, and left its three rifle {{companies}} with only thirty-five men between them. The 12th Devonshire company had another thirty-six killed. Amongst the casualties, was every officer or warrant officer, who had <b>either</b> <b>been</b> killed or wounded. The German defenders from the 3rd Battalion 858th Grenadier Regiment, had numbered 564 men before the British assault, {{by the time}} the village had been captured there were only 146 of them left.|$|E
5|$|The first stone {{churches in}} Norway were Romanesque, built under the {{influence}} of Anglo-Saxon missionaries, particularly bishop Nicholas Breakspear. Later churches were influenced by Continental architecture. Examples include the churches at Ringsaker, Kviteseid, and elsewhere. Many of these churches have <b>either</b> <b>been</b> lost or rebuilt in the Gothic style, but numerous examples still exist, notably the Trondenes Churchat Trondenesin Troms.|$|E
5|$|Although Gibraltar's {{civilian}} inhabitants {{had started}} to return as early as April 1944, the last evacuees did not arrive back home until as late as February 1951. The immediate problem after VJ Day {{was a lack of}} shipping, as all available vessels were needed to bring troops home, but the longer-term problem was a lack of civilian housing. The garrison was relocated to {{the southern end of the}} peninsula to free up space and military accommodation was temporarily reused to house the returning civilians. A programme to build housing projects was implemented, though progress was slow due to shortages of building materials. By 1969, over 2,500 flats had <b>either</b> <b>been</b> built or were under construction.|$|E

5|$|Another {{proposed}} mission {{would have}} seen a Gemini spacecraft rendezvous with a Pegasus satellite in low Earth orbit. The spacecraft would have <b>either</b> <b>been</b> launched directly into an orbit to rendezvous with the Pegasus, or into a lower orbit, subsequently docking with an Agena, and using that to raise its orbit. The Gemini would have flown around the Pegasus, {{and then one of}} the crew would have performed an EVA to recover a piece of one of the spacecraft's micrometeoroid detection panels. This mission would have been used to prove that rendezvous could be accomplished with any spacecraft, to collect data on the satellite's exposure to micrometeoroids — supporting data that the satellite had returned itself, and to demonstrate technology for military flights to inspect hostile satellites.|$|E
5|$|Because all of Germany's {{powerful}} dreadnoughts had <b>either</b> <b>been</b> scuttled in Scapa Flow or ceded to the Allies as war prizes, the Braunschweig-class battleships were recommissioned {{into the}} newly reorganized Reichsmarine. In {{the years following}} World War I, Braunschweig, Elsass, and Hessen were to be rebuilt as coastal defense ships, although this plan was abandoned. Braunschweig served in the Reichsmarine from 1921 to 1926, at which point she was withdrawn from active duty. On 31 May 1931, she was stricken and converted into a hulk at Wilhelmshaven, and eventually scrapped. Elsass saw active duty in the fleet from 1924 until 25 February 1930, at which point she was removed from active service. On 31 March 1931, she was stricken, hulked in Wilhelmshaven. On 31 October 1935, Elsass was sold to Norddeutscher-Lloyd in Bremerhaven, and scrapped in 1936.|$|E
5|$|By 1879, about 2,000 {{people were}} living in Silver Reef. The town had a mile-long Main Street with many businesses, among them a Wells Fargo office, the Rice Building, and the Cosmopolitan Restaurant. Although {{adjacent}} to many settlements with a majority of Mormon residents, the town never had a meeting house for Latter-day Saints, only a Catholic church. In 1879, a fire destroyed several businesses, but the residents rebuilt them. Mines were gradually closed, most of them by 1884, as the worldwide price of silver dropped. By 1901, most of the buildings in town had <b>either</b> <b>been</b> demolished or moved to Leeds.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{significantly}} underestimating {{the size}} of the position they faced, the Australians had succeeded in the pushing D445 VC Battalion and 3/33 NVA Regiment out of a valuable base area intended for long-term use. Regardless, there were few other tangible results to show for the casualties they had incurred as, although numerous blood trails and body parts scattered around the battlefield indicated that communist casualties had been heavy, the majority of their dead had <b>either</b> <b>been</b> removed from the battlefield or were entombed in the bunkers that had been crushed by the Australian tanks. The battle had cost the Australians three killed and six wounded, while only five Viet Cong bodies were recovered.|$|E
5|$|Donkey Kong is a {{video game}} series created by game {{designer}} Shigeru Miyamoto. It is published by Nintendo, with entries in the series developed by Nintendo, Rare, Namco, Retro Studios, and Paon. The series debuted in 1981 with the arcade game Donkey Kong, which was a sales success that brought Nintendo into the North American market. Most Donkey Kong games have <b>either</b> <b>been</b> arcade games or released for Nintendo consoles and handhelds dating from the Nintendo Entertainment System to {{the current generation of}} video game consoles. However, some of the original arcade games were ported into versions on third-party home consoles and developed by several companies. Donkey Kong is among the best-selling video game franchises, with more than 48 million games sold worldwide.|$|E
5|$|Jacobson's case {{attracted}} {{some national}} media attention. Civil liberties advocates supported him, worried {{over what they}} saw as dangerous growth in government police powers during the Reagan and Bush administrations, when law enforcement were alleged to have cracked down on drugs as well as pornography distribution {{at the behest of the}} Religious Right. Operation Looking Glass, the USPS claimed, had netted 147 convictions, but only 35 where evidence was found that the offenders had <b>either</b> <b>been</b> involved in producing child pornography or molested children. Critics claimed that the government was exaggerating the child-porn problem at best and contributing to it at worst, possibly by introducing some consumers to material they might never have developed a taste for otherwise.|$|E

5|$|Leguat {{mentioned}} that pigeons only bred on islets off Rodrigues, due to predation from rats on the mainland. This {{may be the}} reason why Tafforet only observed the Rodrigues starling on an islet. By Tafforet's visit in 1726, the bird must have <b>either</b> <b>been</b> absent or very rare on mainland Rodrigues. Rats could have arrived in 1601, when a Dutch fleet surveyed Rodrigues. The islets {{would have been the}} last refuge for the bird, until the rats colonised them, too. The Rodrigues starling was extinct by the time French scientist Alexandre Guy Pingré visited Rodrigues during the French 1761 Transit of Venus expedition.|$|E
5|$|Of the 26players {{eligible}} for the Baseball Hall of Fame who have struck out four batters in an inning, four have been elected and two were elected on the first ballot.
