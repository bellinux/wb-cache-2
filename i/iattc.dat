Working with Bernie Schaefer and Gerald Howard, Shimada conducted the tuna fishery research for which he is best known during his time with the <b>IATTC</b> and achieved national and international recognition when he began to publish his research on tuna spawning, distribution, and feeding patterns. He received his doctorate from the University of Washington School of Fisheries in 1956, and rose rapidly within the <b>IATTC,</b> serving as the IATTC′s Senior Scientist from 1956 to 1958. Both at POFI and at <b>IATTC,</b> Shimada worked frequently with Townsend Cromwell, a physical oceanographer interested in ocean currents, on research into the distribution of tuna in the Pacific Ocean. Their cooperative work, following the principles of fisheries oceanography Sette, Shimada, Cromwell, and other members of Sette′s team had pioneered at POFI, combined Cromwell's insights into the forces such as temperature gradients that drive currents with Shimada′s findings regarding the availability of forage for the tunas, leading to useful research results for both men.|$|E

The Achotines Laboratory was established as part of the IATTC’s Tuna-Billfish Program.

As tunas are pelagic (open-ocean) fish they are difficult to study in their natural habitat. Little is known from studies of live tunas of their reproductive activities or early life history (egg, larval, and early-juvenile stages), and for that reason the <b>IATTC</b> established a research laboratory to focus on these aspects of tuna biology. The Achotines Laboratory provides a unique setting for studying the reproductive behavior and early life stages of tropical tunas.

This paper reviews the most recent rates of seabird bycatch reported for industrial longline fisheries within the <b>IATTC</b> area. There are significant gaps in the available seabird bycatch data, notably from CPCs such as Japan, Ecuador and Peru. However, the levels of observer coverage, and hence bycatch information, in other CPCs remains largely inadequate when faced with the task of estimating incidental seabirds bycatch. Currently, observer coverage within <b>IATTC</b> industrial longline fisheries is very low (typically < 1 % of effort, with the exception of Hawaii pelagic longline fisheries). Combined with the non-random distribution of observer effort throughout the area, this leads to severe restrictions in the ability to make estimates of overall seabird bycatch. An improvement in the level and spread of observer coverage would greatly enhance the ability of <b>IATTC</b> to estimate seabird mortality in its fisheries, and to reduce effectively seabird bycatch.

40|$|The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (<b>IATTC)</b> {{staff has}} been {{sampling}} the size distributions of tunas {{in the eastern}} Pacific Ocean (EPO) since 1954, and the species composition of the catches since 2000.

These sample data are collected based on a stratified sampling design. I propose an update of the stratification of the EPO into more homogenous areas {{in order to reduce the}} variance in the estimates of the total annual catches and incorporate the geographical shifts resulting from the expansion of the floating-object fishery during the 1990 s. The sampling model used by the <b>IATTC</b> is a stratified two-stage (cluster) random sampling design with first stage units varying (unequal) in size. The strata are month, area, and set type. Wells, the first cluster stage, are selected to be sampled only if all of the fish were caught in the same month, same area, and same set type. Fish, the second cluster stage, are sampled for lengths, and independently, for species composition of the catch. The EPO is divided into 13 sampling areas, which were defined in 1968, based on the catch distributions of yellowfin and skipjack tunas. This area stratification does not reflect the multi-species, multi-set-type fishery of today. In order to define more homogenous areas, I used agglomerative cluster analysis to look for groupings of the size data and the catch and effort data for 2000 – 2006. I plotted the results from both datasets against the <b>IATTC</b> Sampling Areas, and then created new areas. I also used the results of the cluster analysis to update the substitution scheme for strata with catch, but no sample. I then calculated the total annual catch (and variance) by species by stratifying the data into new Proposed Sampling Areas and compared the results to those reported by the <b>IATTC.</b> Results showed that re-stratifying the areas produced smaller variances of the catch estimates for some species in some years, but the results were not significant...|$|E

40|$|The east pacific tuna fishery {{has been}} a highly {{controversial}} industry due {{to a variety of}} biological, economic and political factors. Tuna are a highly migratory species and are known to move across areas of the ocean that are claimed by different nations. The high economic value of the tuna fishery has enhanced the dispute over the positioning of many of these national boundaries. During the middle of the twentieth century international fishery organizations were created in an attempt to resolve many of the issues. The Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (<b>IATTC)</b> was created to make management recommendations to maintain the stocks of yellowfin tuna at a maximum sustainable yield using scientific information. This paper analyzes the effectiveness of an international organization in managing the tuna fishery and compares the Commission with the more recent development of a decentralized policy structure and national jurisdiction over tuna. The <b>IATTC</b> was largely unsuccessful in achieving its goal due to the structure of the organization and its lack of supranational authority. Recent events and UNCLOS III have given coastal states the authority to effectively manage and enforce the tuna fisheries of the east Pacific. the <b>IATTC</b> is still an effective and useful organization for the collection and analysis of fishery data.

It was the first international tuna organization, and only the third international fisheries organization, whose staff has had the responsibility for performing scientific research, the others being the International Pacific Halibut Commission, established in 1923, and the International Pacific Salmon Fisheries Commission, established in 1937. The current members of the <b>IATTC</b> are Costa Rica, Ecuador, EI Salvador, France, Guatemala, Japan, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, the United States, Vanuatu, and Venezuela. The first Director ofthe <b>IATTC</b> was Dr. Milner B. Schaefer, who was in that position from 1950 to 1963. He was followed by Dr. John L.

40|$|The {{objectives}} of the workshop were to continue to develop a stock assessment model for silky sharks in the eastern Pacific Ocean (EPO), identify collaborators and data sources, and collate data. The meeting was attended by scientists {{from many of the}} IATTC’s member countries and other interested parties (Appendix I). On the first day, the <b>IATTC</b> staff gave several presentations describing the stock assessment model, available data, and modeling and data assumptions (Appendix II). The remainder of the meeting focused on identifying useful data sources which could potentially be available from collaborators. The available catch data for silky sharks are incomplete, and assumptions have to be made to reconstruct the total catch. The available data differs among nations and fleets within nations, and so different assumptions have to be made. The assessment model commences in 1993, when catches of sharks began to be recorded in the <b>IATTC</b> purse-seine data base; however, species identification was an issue {{in the early years of}} shark catch reporting. Effort data for the purse-seine fleet prior to 1993 are available, and could be used to reconstruct catch prior to 1993. At a minimum, catch needs to be reconstructed back to 1993 for all fleets.

40|$|Thesis [...] University of WashingtonThe eastern Pacific {{tropical}} tuna fishery has {{developed in the}} last seven decades from its antecedents in a small pole-and-line fishery for albacore tuna in near-shore California waters to a large technologically-advanced multi-national tuna purse seine fishery in the eastern Pacific Ocean from Mexico to Peru and offshore to 2000 miles. Concerns raised by the rapid development of the tuna fishery resulted in the formation in 1949 of the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission (<b>IATTC)</b> to study scientifically the tuna and associated bait fisheries in the area, and to make any needed management recommendations to the Commission's member governments. An ad hoc Inter-Governmental Meeting (IGM) was initiated in 1961 as an informal adjunct to the <b>IATTC,</b> to deal with international regulation of the tuna fishery. The fishery for yellowfin tunas was first regulated in 1966. This limitation of the catch, the increasing number of nations in the fishery, the growing capacity of these fleets to harvest the yellowfin quota, the economic and national needs of the Latin-American Pacific coastal states and the developing trend to control by the coastal states of fishery resources to 200 miles offshore led to increasingly difficult annual resolution of the allocation of the yellowfin quota among the participants in the fishery. More and more aware that neither the <b>IATTC</b> Convention developed in 1949 nor the IGM mechanism devised in 1961 could deal satisfactorily with the new problems of the 1970 's, Mexico and Costa Rica in late 1977 convened a Conference of Plenipotentiaries to develop a new management regime for the eastern Pacific tuna fishery. During subsequent meetings and at a second Conference of Plenipotentiaries in early 1979, important understandings toward a new management regime were reached, but the fundamental problem of the allocation of the resource among the participants eluded resolution throughout the negotiations. If an international management regime is not agreed upon for the 1980 tuna fishing season, unregulated fishing with concomitant eventual damage to the yellowfin resource will very probably occur. Interim ad hoc management arrangements which might develop {{as a result of the}} breakdown of regulation would have negative economic, social and biological consequences. An understanding by the participants of these consequences may force the development of an interim 3 to 5 year tuna management agreement which, while not completely satisfactory to any, will provide a period of relative stability during which new arrangements can be evolved...|$|E
40|$|Unlike {{merchant}} ships, cars, {{and even}} cellphones, industrial fishing vessels {{are not required}} to have unique, permanent identifying numbers. Fishing vessels do have names, call signs, and other identifiers, but those can be changed by the owner quickly and easily. Further, such identifiers are not systematically included in relevant communications. This makes it easy for owners to hide their vessels' true identities if they want to—for example, if the vessels are being used in illicit activities. Illegal activity on the high seas is rampant. Due to gaps in international fisheries policies, operators can evade accountability in numerous ways, allowing them to ignore catch quotas; fish without licenses; use destructive gear; and otherwise flout rules intended to make fishing fair, sustainable, and environmentally sound. In addition, illegal fishing is linked to other serious crimes in the eastern Pacific Ocean, including drug trafficking and human smuggling, as documented by the U. N. Office on Drugs and Crime. The lack of transparency for identifying fishing vessels helps criminal fishermen conceal their crimes. Thus The Pew Charitable Trusts is calling on the Inter-American Tropical Tuna Commission, or <b>IATTC,</b> to take decisive steps to combat illegal, unreported, and unregulated, or IUU, fishing. This can be done by requiring International Maritime Organization, or IMO, numbers for all vessels at least 24 meters in length that fish in waters managed by the commission. From research presented in this brief, Pew finds numerous errors and inconsistencies in data used to identify vessels authorized to fish in <b>IATTC</b> waters.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 The central {{question}} {{of this case}} study asks if circle hook use in Ecuador is motivated {{by a desire to}} catch more sharks. Circle hooks are a conservation technology that limits the by-catch of sea turtles. In 2004, the World Wildlife Fund, the Inter American Tropical Tuna Commission, (<b>IATTC)</b> and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration spearheaded a hook exchange project in the Ecuadorian pelagic longline fishery. Widely used j-hooks were voluntarily exchanged for circle hooks. Volunteers also accepted observers on board. During observation circle hooks were found to increase the capture of sharks. Trade in shark fins is highly lucrative. The promotion of a hook that can capture more sharks may lead to an unintended consequence - increases in the targeting and capturing of sharks. Ecuadorian law allows only the incidental capture of sharks. Qualitative analysis of semi-structured interviews with hook promoters, <b>IATTC</b> biologist, and Ecuadorian fishery leaders, indicate that hooks may be related to an increase in the landings of shark, especially to supply the market for fins. Survey work was conducted in 6 sites along the Ecuadorian coastline. A majority of boat owners, captains, and deckhands (71 %) self-nominated sharks as a target catch. Those familiar with circle hooks indicated that the use of the hooks was not relegated to only the conservation of turtles - captains (41 %) and owners (37 %) preferred circle hooks for their ability to capture shark.
