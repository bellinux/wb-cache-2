25|$|Thiourea {{is used as}} an {{auxiliary}} agent in <b>diazo</b> <b>paper,</b> light-sensitive photocopy paper and almost all other types of copy paper.|$|E
50|$|The diazo copies are of {{different}} sizes {{and for this reason}} the <b>diazo</b> <b>paper</b> is obtainable in standard sizes that vary from 30 cm to 60 cm wide, after de process the copied paper can be cut to the desired size.|$|E
50|$|In {{a variety}} of {{combinations}} and strengths, these two chemicals are mixed together in water and coated onto paper. The resulting coating is then dried yielding the specially treated paper commercially sold as <b>Diazo</b> <b>paper.</b> This solution can also be applied to polyester film or to vellum.|$|E
5000|$|In the [...] <b>diazo</b> copier, the <b>paper</b> is {{immersed}} in a developer solution made from ammonia (or ammonia vapor) converting {{the parts of the}} paper not exposed to the light source to a characteristic dark blue colour [...]|$|R
5000|$|A {{transparent}} film with the pattern to be printed {{is placed on}} a <b>diazo</b> compound coated <b>paper.</b> This sandwich is exposed to ultraviolet light. After a 15 sec to 5 min exposure, ammonia vapours are used to develop the film image onto the paper.|$|R
5000|$|However, {{compound}} [...] "Ozalid Process" [...] appears {{never to}} have been registered as a trademark, {{and the use of}} OZALID specifically for the Ozalid process using <b>diazo</b> compound <b>paper</b> is not currently registered as a trademark at least in the United States. OZALID as a mark for [...] "machines for diazo type prints" [...] was first registered in the United States in 1938 and is now expired. [...] Similarly, another registration for the use of OZALID for Light-Sensitive Diazotype Papers, Cloths, Films, etc., Machines for Photoprinting Thereon, Machines for Developing the Photoprints Thus Produced and Parts of Such Machines was first registered in the United States in 1942, and also has expired.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{document is}} laid {{on top of}} the chemically-coated side of a sheet of <b>diazo</b> <b>paper,</b> which is retrieved from a light-protected flat file, and the two sheets are fed into the diazo duplicator, being pulled into the machine by rotating rubber friction wheels. There are two chambers inside the machine. The first is the exposure area, where the sandwich of the two sheets (the master and the <b>diazo</b> <b>paper)</b> pass in front of an ultraviolet lamp. Ultraviolet light penetrates the original and neutralizes the light sensitive diazonium salt wherever there was no image on the master. These areas become the white areas on the copy. Once this process is complete, the undeveloped image at the locations where the UV light could not penetrate can often be seen as very light yellow or white marks/lines on the diazo sheet. This completes the exposure phase.|$|E
50|$|If {{the lines}} are too light, it is also {{possible}} to run the blue-line through the developing chamber once more, which often increases the contrast of the lines relative to the base media. Repeated lack of contrast and light prints is also a tip-off that the operator needs to adjust the speed or amount of ammonia. Sometimes both the master and the diazo print are inadvertently fed through the developing chamber together. If this occurs, one simply peels the master from the <b>diazo</b> <b>paper</b> and runs the diazo sheet through the developer once more to more fully develop the lines.|$|E
5000|$|In {{the process}} of {{whiteprint}} copying , [...] (essentially a diazotype process), a dynamic contact copier is used (similar to the manual action of exposing both sheets strongly bonded directly to the sunlight.). The exposition is made progressively as the twin rollers pull the two papers together (original and copy) against a source of ultraviolet light, typically a powerful black light lamp [...] The original plan (on a transparent support) and the <b>diazo</b> <b>paper</b> are introduced, in perfect contact, within the pinch rollers of the contact copier. The sensitized paper, has a photosensitive coating -an impregnation of diazo - covering {{the surface of the}} paper. Once exposed, the copied paper is immersed in a developer solution made from ammonia (or ammonia vapor) converting the parts of the paper not exposed to the light source to a characteristic dark violet colour (blue-line).|$|E
50|$|Next, the {{original}} is peeled from the <b>diazo</b> <b>paper</b> as the sandwich of master and diazo exits the machine, and the diazo sheet alone is {{fed into the}} developing chamber. Here, fumes of ammonium hydroxide create an extremely alkaline environment. Under these conditions, the azodyes (couplers) react with the remaining diazonium salt and undergo a chemical reaction that results in the unexposed lines changing color from invisible (or yellow) to a visible dark color. The range of colors for these lines is usually blue or black, but sepia (a brownish hue) is also quite popular. When making multiple copies of an original {{no more than four}} or five copies can typically be made at a time, due to the build-up of ammonia fumes, even with ventilation fans in the duplication room. A slight delay of perhaps five minutes is often required for the fumes to subside enough to permit making additional copies if no ventilation exists. Many blueprint shops ran ventilation ducts from the machines to outside. Smaller and mid-size blueprint machines were often outfitted with ammonia neutralizer absorbers which absorbed some of the ammonia for a period of time.|$|E
40|$|We {{compared}} five {{methods for}} measuring light availability {{in the tropical}} forest understorey: the LAI- 2000 PCA, an empirical LAI-metre, a densiometre, photosensitive <b>diazo</b> <b>paper</b> metres, and hemispherical photographs. Measurements were made along three 250 m transects and adjacent to 95 seedlings on four logged or virgin plots of a French Guianese forest. Correlation analysis showed that more mobile and less expensive methods, such as the LAI metre and <b>diazo</b> <b>paper</b> metres, can provide similar information to more cumbersome or expensive equipment such as the LAI- 2000 metre or hemispherical photographs. All instruments except the densiometre detected differences among seedlings from different post-logging microsites. Few significant correlations were found between light measures {{and the number of}} trees or their basal area within 10 m, which may reflect an increase in the density of smaller stems and lianas during post-logging succession...|$|E
