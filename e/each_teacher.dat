40|$|As {{teachers}} {{attempt to}} navigate an increasingly technological educational environment, {{they find themselves}} faced with numerous barriers. This study looked at three teacher leaders who navigated, {{with varying degrees of}} success, various contexts of and barriers to technology based reform. The {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate <b>each</b> <b>teacher’s</b> classroom technology usage and to examine how personal, cultural and contextual factors affected <b>each</b> <b>teacher’s</b> ability and willingness to use technology in support of their mathematics instruction. This study used a multiple case study design and relied on multiple qualitative data sources. Findings indicated that, while context and teacher characteristics influenced the change process, teacher thinking, in the form of a student-oriented focus, played the largest role in enabling teachers to adopt technology-based changes. Implications from this study emphasize the need to motivate teachers to reconstruct their knowledge and beliefs about the role of technology in mathematics education...|$|R
25|$|After the Żeligowski's Mutiny in October 1920, Vilnius {{region was}} {{incorporated}} into the Republic of Central Lithuania, a puppet state of the Second Polish Republic. Almost immediately Lithuanian organizations, including Rytas, faced increased scrutiny and restrictions. The Lithuanian gymnasium for girls was closed in August 1921 and the boys' gymnasium (renamed to Vytautas the Great Gymnasium) was forcibly removed from its premises in October 1921. In 1923, the regional education commission began demanding that each school independently obtained a permit which was valid for only a year (multi-year permits were introduced in 1927). The commission had to approve <b>each</b> <b>teacher,</b> and it refused to approve {{if they were not}} Polish citizens or did not have certificates of morality (świadectwo moralności), i.e. a proof of correct political leanings. For example, in 1926, of 106 proposed teachers only 56 were approved. In July 1924, Minister Stanisław Grabski sponsored a law which regulated schools of ethnic minorities. Other requirements and limitations applied to teachers' education, textbooks, classroom hygiene, etc. These requirements particularly affected Ukrainian and Belarusian schools. Attitudes towards Lithuanian schools were more lenient, perhaps in hopes of normalizing the tensions between Poland and Lithuania.|$|E
500|$|... {{consider}} {{a model of}} classroom scheduling [...] in which a set of n teachers must be scheduled to teach each of m cohorts of students. The number of hours per week that teacher i spends with cohort j is described by entry Rij of a matrix R given as input to the problem, and <b>each</b> <b>teacher</b> also has a set of hours during {{which he or she}} is available to be scheduled. As they show, the problem is NP-complete, even when <b>each</b> <b>teacher</b> has at most three available hours, but it can be solved as an instance of 2-satisfiability when <b>each</b> <b>teacher</b> only has two available hours. (Teachers with only a single available hour may easily be eliminated from the problem.) In this problem, each variable vij corresponds to an hour that teacher i must spend with cohort j, the assignment to the variable specifies whether that hour is the first or the second of the teacher's available hours, and there is a 2-satisfiability clause preventing any conflict of either of two types: two cohorts assigned to a teacher {{at the same time as}} each other, or one cohort assigned to two teachers at the same time.|$|E
2500|$|As {{education}} is a provincial concern, sex education varies across Canada. Ontario has a provincial curriculum created in 1998.

[...] Mandatory sex education {{was removed from the}} Quebec provincial curriculum in 2005.

40|$|The problems. The {{experimental}} {{problems were}} {{to demonstrate the}} effectiveness of an audio cueing procedure in manipulating teacher praise and to assess any subsequent changes in students' violations of classroom rules in a day care center. Procedure. Three <b>teachers,</b> one in <b>each</b> of three daily free play periods, and nine children were observed using an interval recording technique. The cues were short duration audio-tape recorded tones presented automatically. Teachers were instructed to praise a child's good behavior at least after every cue. Findings. <b>Each</b> <b>teacher's</b> percentage of 20 second intervals in which praise was recorded was increased over her respective baseline. Following low cueing rates, <b>each</b> <b>teacher's</b> praise increased when high cueing rates were presented and decreased when low rates were reintroduced. Spearman's rho correlations of praise levels and median rule violations yielded r = -. 116, r = -. 002, and r = -. 073 in the three periods. Conclusions. The cueing procedure was an efficient and effective tool in manipulating the teachers' levels of praise. Praise and rule violations were not systematically related possibly because (as informal observation indicated) other forms of teacher attention followed both appropriate and inappropriate student behaviors. Recommendations. Future studies should assess the effect of teacher praise on the student behaviors which are praised...|$|R

2500|$|Value-added {{modeling}} (also {{known as}} value-added analysis and value-added assessment) {{is a method}} of teacher evaluation that measures the teacher's contribution {{in a given year}} by comparing the current test scores of their students to the scores of those same students in previous school years, {{as well as to the}} scores of other students in the same grade. In this manner, value-added modeling seeks to isolate the contribution, or value added, that <b>each</b> <b>teacher</b> provides in a given year, which can be compared to the performance measures of other teachers. VAMs are considered to be fairer than simply comparing student achievement scores or gain scores without considering potentially confounding context variables like past performance or income. [...] It is also possible to use this approach to estimate the value added by the school principal or the school as a whole.|$|E

60|$|The ground which I {{have been}} laying out, is common, all over our country; in {{particular}} places, there will be, even much more, that is common.

If a Roman Catholic community establish a school, and appoint a Roman Catholic teacher, he may properly, in his intercourse with his scholars, allude, with commendation, to the opinions and practices of that church. If a college is established by the Methodist denomination, the teacher of that institution may, of course, explain and enforce there, the views of that society. <b>Each</b> <b>teacher</b> is confined only to those views which are common to the founders and supporters of the particular institution, to which he is attached.|$|E

Afterwards he will give him less and less assistance, till he can keep the record properly himself. The record of each day will be read on the succeeding, at the hour for business. He will have a committee of one or two {{to take care of the}} fire, and another to see that the room is constantly in good order. He will have distributors for each division of seats, to distribute books, and compositions, and pens, and to collect votes. And thus, in a short time, his school will become regularly organized, as a society, or legislative assembly.
