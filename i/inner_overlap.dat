The calyx consists of eight to ten, free, concave, and spirally arranged sepals which gradually increase in size from outer to <b>inner,</b> <b>overlap</b> in the bud, and do not fall after flowering. These sepals are approximately oval in shape, leathery in consistency and are covered in simple one-celled straight or slightly curved hairs of 0.2-0.6 mm. Sepals and petals both contain crystals of various shapes and mucilaginous cells. The five (or sometimes six) free petals are oval, {{much larger than the}} sepals, also overlap in the bud, but fall off after flowering, with a range in form that includes inverted egg-shaped. The petals are thick, cream to yellow in color, sometimes with a purple blush, and with an irregular pattern of brown or red veins. The ten free filaments are the same color as the petals, thick, gradually tapering upwards, 4-5¼ cm long, ½ cm broad, and carry facing the style an anther that is connected at midlength with the filament. The dark brownish anthers open with slits to the sides to release the cream-colored pollen. Pollen is triangular with very short slits at each of the corners and lacks further adornment. The outer margin of the disc is a very distinct narrow circular ridge-shaped nectar gland with ten side-ridges radiating out. The four to seven carpels are fused and carry a single, long, straight style which is topped by a lobed stigma. The style is not shed after flowering.|$|E
40|$|Composite {{primary and}} {{secondary}} aircraft structures {{have the potential to}} achieve the same strength and stiffness as conventional metallic structures, but at substantially lower weight. To accomplish this in an efficient and effective manner the joints used to attach these composite structures will be critical. This work investigated the strain distribution in adhesively bonded and hybrid bolted/bonded composite single-strap butt joints using a 2 D digital image correlation (DIC) technique and geometrically nonlinear finite element modelling. A high magnification optical setup was used to measure the strains in the through thickness direction, allowing strain measurements in the region of the adhesive and along the bondline in the joint overlap section. This provided a detailed measure of strain flow through the adhesive and into the doubler and adherend under a maximum tensile load of 5338 N (1200 lbf). In all cases a crack developed at the <b>inner</b> <b>overlap</b> section in the hybrid joints and, using DIC techniques, the size of the crack as well as crack tip strains could be determined from the deformed images. The information obtained from the DIC measurements proved valuable in helping to improve the fidelity of the finite element model. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|E
40|$|The {{deformation}} of adhesively bonded composite butt joints in tension was investigated experimentally, theoretically, and numerically. Two single-strap butt joints were tested, {{the only difference}} between them being the thickness of the doubler. The case 1 joint was fabricated using identical laminated composite panels for both the adherends and the doubler, while the case 2 joint had a 50 % thicker doubler. Expressions for the effective Young's modulus and bending stiffness for the composite butt joint were derived under both plane strain and plane stress conditions. Joint deformation in the out-of-plane direction and longitudinal elongation could then be theoretically analyzed. A theoretical model for the joint elongation was developed, and an approach was proposed to deal with the strain discontinuity at the overlap end of the joint using the derived theoretical method. Three-dimensional finite element models were created for the analysis of the unit-width joints under a plane strain condition. Good agreement in the predicted joint deformation (deflection, elongation, and strain) was achieved between the three methods. The results suggested that joint bending under both plane strain and plane stress condition should be studied so that the actual strain range in high bend areas (overlap edge regions) can be determined. Expressions for the four basic parameters in the coupled adhesive stress differential equations were also developed and two strategies were presented to explore the complete closed-form adhesive stress solutions in a general composite butt joint configuration. Finite element results showed that peak adhesive stresses were located at the <b>inner</b> <b>overlap</b> edge, and suggested that appropriate reinforcement should be made in this region to ensure a sufficient safety margin.

The mean velocities and the velocity dispersions of the BHB samples (|Z|< 3 kpc) are characteristic of the halo, while those of the Century Survey A-type stars are characteristic of the thick disk.

These anticonvulsants are neutral, {{in contrast to the}} mostly positively charged local anesthetics, but their open/inactivated-state blocking affinities are similar. Using a model of the open pore of the Na+ channel that we developed by homology with the crystal structures of potassium channels, we have docked these three anticonvulsants with residues identified by mutagenesis as important for their binding energy. The three drugs show a common pharmacophore, including an aromatic ring that has an aromatic-aromatic interaction with Tyr- 1771 of NaV 1. 2 and a polar amide or imide that interacts with the aromatic ring of Phe- 1764 by a low-energy amino-aromatic hydrogen bond. The second aromatic ring is nearly at a right angle to the pharmacophore and fills the pore lumen, probably interacting with the other S 6 segments and physically occluding the inner pore to block Na+ permeation. Hydrophobic interactions with this second aromatic ring may contribute an important component to binding for anticonvulsants, which compensates energetically for the absence of positive charge in their structures. Voltage dependence of block, their important therapeutic property, results from their interaction with Phe- 1764, which connects them to the voltage sensors. Their use dependence is modest and this results from being neutral, with a fast drug off-rate after repolarization, allowing a normal action potential rate {{in the presence of the}} drugs...|$|R

By analyzing the overlap between successively smaller core areas among individuals {{in a population}} of the long-lived Australian skink, the sleepy lizard (Tiliqua rugosa), we objectively determined exclusive areas within animal ranges. Using 4 -year radio tracking data, we found that ranges consisted of relatively large sally zones (mean 66 – 80 % total range), around home ranges with multinucleate cores strongly associated with key refuge sites. Total range and home range area varied significantly among years, being smaller in a drought year. Total ranges overlapped extensively between and within sexes, but for both sexes, intrasexual <b>overlap</b> of <b>inner</b> range cores rapidly approached zero, suggesting intrasexual territoriality. Intersexual <b>inner</b> core <b>overlap</b> reflected this species socially monogamous mating system. But, male overlap of female ranges and inner cores was consistently higher than female-male overlap. Refuges and/or mates may be defended resources within these core areas, although aggressive behavioral interactions were rarely observed. In the extensively overlapping sally zones, males shared space with females other than their principal partner. In productive years, with larger home ranges and more extensive overlap, some lizards associated with extra partners, suggesting that males opportunistically use sally zones for polygyny.

Further afield, about one new "short-peroid" comet is discovered each year.

40|$|International audienceMacrocyclic lactones (ML) are {{important}} anthelmintics used in {{animals and humans}} against parasite nematodes, but their therapeutic success is compromised by the spread of ML resistance. Some ABC transporters, such as p-glycoproteins (Pgps), are selected and overexpressed in ML-resistant nematodes, supporting a role for some drug efflux proteins in ML resistance. However, the role of such proteins in ML transport remains to be clarified at the molecular level. Recently, Caenorhabditis elegans Pgp- 1 (Cel-Pgp- 1) has been crystallized, and its drug-modulated ATPase function characterized in vitro revealed Cel-Pgp- 1 as a multidrug transporter. Using this crystal structure, we have developed an in silico drug docking model in order to study the binding of ML and other anthelmintic drugs to Cel-Pgp- 1. All tested ML bound with high affinity in a unique site, within the inner chamber of the protein, supporting that ML may be transported by Cel-Pgp- 1. Interestingly, interacting residues delineate a ML specific fingerprint involving H-bonds, including T 1028. In particular, benzofurane and spiroketal moieties bound to specific sub-sites. When compared with the aglycone ML, such as moxidectin and ivermectin aglycone, avermectin anthelmintics have significant higher affinity for Cel-Pgp- 1, likely due to the sugar substituent(s) that bind to a specific area involving H-bonds at Y 771. Triclabendazole, closantel and emodepside bound with good affinities to different sub-sites in the <b>inner</b> chamber, partially <b>overlapping</b> with the ML binding site, suggesting that they could compete for Cel-Pgp- 1 -mediated ML transport.

30|$|Sufficient {{data are}} {{missing in the}} {{literature}} whether additional osteosynthesis is beneficial or not. Perisano et al. suggested additional osteosynthesis after intralesional excision for all lesions that were larger than 5  cm. Osteosynthesis was also suggested for all lesions of the distal femur irrespective of their size due to higher risk of fractures at this location [12]. Our results confirm the high risk of early fracture at the distal femur but also show distinct advantages if additional osteosynthesis was avoided. Patients were more satisfied and had less pain and better function as well as less complication if osteosynthesis was not used. At the long term, sufficient stability was restored as cortical bone could overgrow the cement filling at the bone window at the entry site. To facilitate this, we recommend a bone cement technique which only fills the <b>inner</b> lesion without <b>overlapping</b> the cortical wall of the femur. In the present series, the risk for fracture was only evident early after surgery as all fractures occurred within 3  months, which may suggest a more cautious postoperative regime without sport activities for up to 3 or even 6  months. To minimize soft tissue trauma in case of osteosynthesis and as the implants were recommended not to be removed later on, we rather used short plates based {{on the concept of}} a compound bone cement osteosynthesis with integration of the screws in the bone cement, where sufficient stability is expected without longer fixation above the lesion. The use of longer plates, however, would have presumably reduced the fracture rate in the osteosynthesis group. To obtain objective data, we encourage further biomechanical cadaver studies on this topic, to validate the stability after intralesional bone cement filling without osteosynthesis and with compound osteosynthesis using different sized locking compression plates. Furthermore, the results from the present study support the initiation of multicenter studies on this issue, to reduce bias and increase statistical power by obtaining larger series, which may define further criteria for decision making.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The semicircular canals, a {{subdivision}} of the vestibular {{system of the}} vertebrate inner ear, function as sensors of angular acceleration. Little is currently known, however, regarding the underlying molecular mechanisms that govern {{the development of this}} intricate structure. Zebrafish represent a particularly tractable model system for the study of inner ear development. This is because the ear can be easily visualized during early embryogenesis, and both forward and reverse genetic techniques are available that {{can be applied to the}} discovery of novel genes that contribute to proper ear development. We have previously shown that in zebrafish, the calcium sensing molecule neuronal calcium sensor- 1 (NCS- 1) is required for semicircular canal formation. The function of NCS- 1 in regulating semicircular canal formation has not yet been elucidated. Results We initiated a multistep functional proteomic strategy to identify neuronal calcium sensor- 1 (NCS- 1) binding partners (NBPs) that contribute to inner ear development in zebrafish. By performing a Y 2 H screen in combination with literature and database searches, we identified 10 human NBPs. BLAST searches of the zebrafish EST and genomic databases allowed us to clone zebrafish orthologs of each of the human NBPs. By investigating the expression profiles of zebrafish NBP mRNAs, we identified seven that were expressed in the developing <b>inner</b> ear and <b>overlapped</b> with the ncs- 1 a expression profile. GST pulldown experiments confirmed that selected NBPs interacted with NCS- 1, while morpholino-mediated knockdown experiments demonstrated an essential role for arf 1, pi 4 kβ, dan, and pink 1 in semicircular canal formation. Conclusion Based on their functional profiles, the hypothesis is presented that Ncs- 1 a/Pi 4 kβ/Arf 1 form a signaling pathway that regulates secretion of molecular components, including Dan and Bmp 4, that are required for development of the vestibular apparatus. A second set of NBPs, consisting of Pink 1, Hint 2, and Slc 25 a 25, are destined for localization in mitochondria. Our findings reveal a novel signalling pathway involved in development of the semicircular canal system, and suggest a previously unrecognized role for NCS- 1 in mitochondrial function via its association with several mitochondrial proteins. </p...|$|R
40|$|Our early {{twenty-first century}} civilization is being {{squeezed}} between advancing deserts and rising seas. Measured by the land area that can support human habitation, {{the earth is}} shrinking. Mounting population densities, once generated solely {{by the addition of}} over 70 million people per year, are now also fueled by the relentless advance of deserts and the rise in sea level. The newly established trends of expanding deserts and rising seas are both of human origin. The former is primarily the result of overstocking grasslands and overplowing land. Rising seas result from temperature increases set in motion by carbon released from the burning of fossil fuels. The heavy losses of territory to advancing deserts in China and Nigeria, the most populous countries in Asia and Africa respectively, illustrate the trends for scores of other countries. China is not only losing productive land to deserts, but it is doing so at an accelerating rate. From 1950 to 1975 China lost an average of 600 square miles of land (1, 560 square kilometers) to desert each year. By 2000, nearly 1, 400 square miles were going to desert annually. A U. S. Embassy report entitled "Desert Mergers and Acquisitions" describes satellite images that show two deserts in north-central China expanding and merging to form a single, larger desert <b>overlapping</b> <b>Inner</b> Mongolia and Gansu provinces. To the west in Xinjiang Province, two even larger deserts [...] the Taklimakan and Kumtag [...] are also heading for a merger. Further east, the Gobi Desert has marched to within 150 miles (241 kilometers) of Beijing, alarming China's leaders. Chinese scientists report that over the last half-century, some 24, 000 villages in northern and western China were abandoned or partly depopulated as they were overrun by drifting sand. All the countries in central Asia [...] Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan [...] are losing land to desertification. Kazakhstan, site of the vast Soviet Virgin Lands Project, has abandoned nearly half of its cropland since 1980. In Afghanistan, a country with a Canadian-sized population of 31 million, the Registan Desert is migrating westward, encroaching on agricultural areas. A U. N. Environment Programme (UNEP) team reports that "up to 100 villages have been submerged by windblown dust and sand.
