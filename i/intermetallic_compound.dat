Eutectic alloys also solidify at a single temperature, all components precipitating simultaneously in so-called coupled growth. Non-eutectic compositions on cooling start to first precipitate the non-eutectic phase; dendrites when it is a metal, large crystals when it is an <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound.</b> Such a mixture of solid particles in a molten eutectic {{is referred to as}} a mushy state.

2500|$|In the {{resonating}} {{valence bond}} theory, {{the factors that}} determine the choice of one from among alternative crystal structures of a metal or <b>intermetallic</b> <b>compound</b> revolve around the energy of resonance of bonds among interatomic positions. It is clear that some modes of resonance would make larger contributions (be more mechanically stable than others), and that in particular a simple ratio of number of bonds to number of positions would be exceptional. The resulting principle is that a special stability {{is associated with the}} simplest ratios or [...] "bond numbers": , , , , , etc. The choice of structure and the value of the axial ratio (which determines the relative bond lengths) are thus a result of the effort of an atom to use its valency in the formation of stable bonds with simple fractional bond numbers.|$|E
