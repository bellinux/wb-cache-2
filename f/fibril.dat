5|$|An {{alternative}} model {{assumes that}} PrPSc exists only as fibrils, and that <b>fibril</b> ends bind PrPC and convert it into PrPSc. If this were all, then {{the quantity of}} prions would increase linearly, forming ever longer fibrils. But exponential growth of both PrPSc and of the quantity of infectious particles is observed during prion disease. This {{can be explained by}} taking into account <b>fibril</b> breakage. A mathematical solution for the exponential growth rate resulting from the combination of <b>fibril</b> growth and <b>fibril</b> breakage has been found. The exponential growth rate depends largely on the square root of the PrPC concentration. The incubation period is determined by the exponential growth rate, and in vivo data on prion diseases in transgenic mice match this prediction. The same square root dependence is also seen in vitro in experiments with a variety of different amyloid proteins.|$|E

25|$|A {{number of}} studies have {{indicated}} keratoconic corneas show signs of increased activity by proteases, a class of enzymes that break some of the collagen cross-linkages in the stroma, with a simultaneous reduced expression of protease inhibitors.

Whatever the pathogenetical process, the damage caused by activity within the cornea likely results in a reduction in its thickness and biomechanical strength. At an ultrastructural level the weakening of the corneal tissue is associated with a disruption of the regular arrangement of the collagen layers and collagen <b>fibril</b> orientation.

Type I collagen <b>fibrils</b> assembled into thin films provide excellent viewing of cells interacting with individual <b>fibrils.</b> Cells can be observed to extensively manipulate the <b>fibrils,</b> and this behavior seems to result in an incompletely spread stellate morphology and a nonproliferative phenotype that is typical of these cells in collagen gels.
