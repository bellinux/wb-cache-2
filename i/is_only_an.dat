5|$|Accommodation is {{provided}} for all undergraduates, {{and for some}} graduates, though some accommodation is off-site. Members are generally expected to dine in hall, where there are two sittings every evening, one informal and one formal, except on Saturdays, where there <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> informal sitting. The Bar, situated underneath the Hall, serves food from mid-morning and drinks in the evening. There is both a Junior Common Room (JCR), between Second and Third quad, and a Middle Common Room (MCR), on the Island Site.|$|E
5|$|Notably, {{both the}} highest and lowest judges' scores are omitted to cancel out any discrepancy, giving a maximum of 60 style points. A perfect jump on a K200 hill would {{therefore}} garner a minimum of 180 points (120 distance points + 60 style points) or more, depending on bonus points. However, such a scenario <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> example and not representative of the highly variable nature of the sport. Gaining one or more scores of 20 is very rare, and five is extremely rare. Generally, a good to excellent jump {{can be expected to}} receive judges' scores of 18 to 19.5. While a lower score for style puts an athlete at the risk of being less competitive, this may be mitigated or even nullified if they have attained substantial bonus points for distance.|$|E
5|$|There is an inherent, {{systemic}} {{problem with}} any metric based on comparing {{with one or}} a few reference translations: in real life, sentences can be translated in many different ways, sometimes with no overlap. Therefore, the approach of comparing by how much any given translation result by a computer differs from just a few human translations is flawed. HyTER is another automated MT metric that compares to very many translations in a reference grammar defined by human translators; the drawback is then that the human effort involved in correctly defining the combinatorially many ways to render the meaning of the translation in practice means HyTER also <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> approximation.|$|E

25|$|The Whittle {{likelihood}} {{in general}} <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> approximation, {{it is only}} exact if the spectrum is constant, i.e., in the trivial case of white noise.|$|E
25|$|A simple {{harmonic}} oscillator 'vibration' <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> oversimplified dynamic {{representation of}} the longitudinal vibrations of the DNA intertwined helices which {{were found to be}} anharmonic rather than harmonic as often assumed in quantum dynamic simulations of DNA.|$|E
6000|$|Why, {{bless the}} poor man, no! This <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> mommet they've made of [...] him, that's got neither chine nor chitlings. His innerds <b>be</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> [...] lock of straw from Bridle's barton.|$|R
50|$|Filmmaking <b>was</b> not <b>only</b> art for him. In {{his opinion}} it <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> {{means to the}} end of serving people: It <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> means of expressing his anger at the sorrows and sufferings of his people.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I <b>am</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> poor girl,' {{returned}} Sissy. 'I {{was separated}} from my father - he <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> stroller - and taken pity on by Mr. Gradgrind. I {{have lived in the}} house ever since.' ...|$|R
25|$|This {{model for}} {{differentiating}} among {{these aspects of}} BDSM is increasingly used in literature today. Nevertheless, it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> attempt at phenomenological differentiation. Individual tastes and preferences {{in the area of}} sexuality may overlap among these areas, which are discussed separately here.|$|E
25|$|Shboul {{notes that}} al-Mas‘udi rewrote Muruj adh-dhahab. The extant version <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> earlier draft from 947, not the revised 956 edition. Lunde and Stone note that al-Mas‘udi in his Tanbih {{states that the}} revised edition of Muruj adh-dhahab {{contained}} 365 chapters.|$|E
25|$|The {{resulting}} wave {{appears to}} have a preferred time direction, because it respects causality. However, this <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> illusion. Indeed, it is always possible to reverse the time direction by simply exchanging the labels emitter and absorber. Thus, the apparently preferred time direction results from the arbitrary labelling.|$|E
60|$|She {{felt that}} they were lying. She <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> woman against five men. She <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> petty {{domestic}} tyrant; she might have been a larger one. But she had all the courage of that possibility.|$|R
6000|$|... "She <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> girl," [...] Christian Young {{said with}} slow solemnity. The {{discovery}} {{seemed to have}} been made {{on the spur of the}} moment. [...] "She <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> girl," [...] he repeated with greater solemnity.|$|R
6000|$|... "It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> vague {{feeling on}} my part," [...] Martin temporized. [...] "I {{have no reason}} for it. It <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> feeling, and most likely it is wrong. You {{certainly}} should know him better than I." ...|$|R
25|$|Some nouns take no {{ligature}} morpheme; these mostly denote {{parts of}} the body (e.g. bila 'mouth', napa 'tooth', kakma 'nose') or kinship (e.g. lakra 'opposite-sex sibling'), although there <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> imperfect correlation between membership of this morphological class and semantic inalienability (see also relationals below).|$|E
25|$|The {{argument}} for the kippa has two sides. The Vilna Gaon said one can make a berakhah without a kippah, since wearing a kippah <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> midos chassidus ("exemplary attribute"). Recently, {{there has been an}} effort to suppress earlier sources that practiced this leniency, including erasing lenient responsa from newly published books.|$|E
25|$|Ordinarily {{seigniorage}} <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> {{interest-free loan}} (for instance of gold) to the issuer {{of the coin}} or paper money. When the currency is worn out, the issuer buys it back at face value, thereby balancing exactly the revenue received when it was put into circulation, without any additional amount for the interest value of what the issuer received.|$|E
60|$|For a {{fleeting}} moment a shadow darkened his boyish face, {{to be replaced}} by the glow of tenderness. He <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> boy, as she <b>was</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> girl--two young things on the threshold of life, house-renting and buying carpets together.|$|R

25|$|Link {{numbering}} <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> {{issue in}} multi-link interfaces. The first link (the primary link), is assigned a link number of 1, subsequent links are assigned increasing link numbers; so the second (secondary) link in a dual-link system is link 2. The link number {{of a given}} interface is indicated by a VPID packet located in the vertical ancillary data space.|$|E
25|$|So far, H <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> {{abstract}} Hermitian operator. However {{using the}} correspondence principle {{it is possible}} to show that, in the classical limit, the expectation value of H is indeed the classical energy. The correspondence principle does not completely fix the form of the quantum Hamiltonian due to the uncertainty principle and therefore the precise form of the quantum Hamiltonian must be fixed empirically.|$|E
25|$|Craig {{believes}} that recent discoveries about {{the expansion of}} the universe and relativity theory support his view that thermodynamic properties of the universe show it is not eternal. Craig says that postulating a multiverse of worlds in varying thermodynamic states encounters the problem of Boltzmann brains—that it becomes highly probable for any observer that the universe <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> illusion of his own brain, a solipsistic conclusion Craig says no rational person would embrace.|$|E
50|$|The road {{parallels}} U.S. Route 41 (Skokie Highway), which <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> {{few miles}} to the west, and Illinois Route 137 (Amstutz Expressway), which <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>a</b> few {{miles to the}} east. It is the major north - south road between those two expressways.|$|R

25|$|A child's weight may be {{influenced}} when he/she <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> infant. Researchers also did a cohort study on 19,397 babies, from their birth until age seven and discovered that fat babies at four months were 1.38 {{times more likely to}} be overweight at seven years old compared to normal weight babies. Fat babies at the age of one were 1.17 {{times more likely to be}} overweight at age seven compared to normal weight babies.|$|E
25|$|A residue may form on newly erupted {{teeth of}} both dentitions that may leave the teeth extrinsically stained. This green-gray residue, Nasmyth membrane, {{consists}} of the fused tissue of the reduced enamel epithelium and oral epithelium, {{as well as the}} dental cuticle placed by the ameloblasts on the newly formed outer enamel surface. Nasmyth membrane then easily picks up stain from food debris and is hard to remove except by selective polishing. The child’s supervising adults may need reassurance that it <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> extrinsic stain on a child’s newly erupted teeth.|$|E
25|$|Since theorists of {{literature}} often draw {{on a very}} heterogeneous tradition of Continental philosophy and the philosophy of language, any classification of their approaches <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>an</b> approximation. There are many types of literary theory, which take different approaches to texts. Even among those listed below, many scholars combine methods {{from more than one}} of these approaches (for instance, the deconstructive approach of Paul de Man drew on a long tradition of close reading pioneered by the New Critics, and de Man was trained in the European hermeneutic tradition).|$|E
