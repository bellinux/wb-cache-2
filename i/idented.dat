50|$|The ibisbill is 38 - 41 cm {{long and}} is quite unmistakable in appearance. The adult is grey {{with a white}} belly, a crimson, long down-curved bill {{similar to that of}} the {{unrelated}} ibis, and a black face and black breast band. The sexes are similar, but young birds lack the black on the face and breast, and the bill is duller. The bill is 6.8 - 8.2 cm long and is slightly longer in females. The legs are greyish purple in the breeding adults and dull sepia in juveniles or greenish in younger or non-breeding adults. The legs of deceased ibisbills change color to a crimson similar to the bill shade shortly after death. The tarsi is short and reticultated. The ibisbill has three toes, lacking the hind toe. The outer and middle toes are connected by a small, <b>idented</b> web, while the middle and inner toes possess no webbing. The Ibisbill typically weighs 270 - 320 g and females weigh slightly more than males. In spite of its spectacular appearance it is inconspicuous in its stony environment. The call is a ringing Klew-klew similar to that of a greenshank. In flight, its outstretched neck and rounded wings give an ibis-like appearance.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{objectives}} of the project titled "Development of durable repairs for civil aircraft structures" is to identify structural adhesives for aircraft repairs. In this connection, a literature survey is conducted to identify alternates for room Temperature curable liquid epoxy adhesives like Araldite 403 A/B & Araldite 501 A/B and to replace High Temperature (HT) curable film adhesives like Redux 312 / 5 and Redux 319 A. Selection criteria for a particular adhesive for aircraft repair depends upon various factors like service temperature, viscosity, lap shear strength, pot life, shelf life of the adhesive,etc. This report highlights how structural adhesives are selected for aircraft repair at room temperature and that for repairs at elevated temperatures. The adhesives like Redux 81 0, Redux 870 A/B, Magnabond 6380 are chosen for RT cure, FA 4 94, Epibond l 590 AiB are opted for 120 Deg.

Surfing and surf tourism run parallel: they are focused upon location-specific destinations where {{natural resources and}} phenomena occur conducive to the sport; and travelling {{for the sake of}} surfing new places is as old as the sport itself. This research serves to improve the overall understanding of surf tourism in Thailand and to offer recommendations for sustainability and quality of experience. As an investigation, three ideas within the broad environment of Thailand have been rationalized: to survey and assess the coastal resource {{in order to determine the}} plausibility and practicability of surf tourism in Thailand (including the discovery and documentation of surf breaks); to interpret the surf tourist characteristics of Phuket, Thailand, through unstructured and semi-structured personal interviews; and to answer the question: "What future for surf tourism in Thailand? " This research has <b>idented</b> and assessed five of Thailand's provincial areas most suited for surf tourism, and has identified that contrary to popular belief there are a large number of areas suitablefor surfing and surf tourism, including those for advanced, intermediate, and beginner surfers. In all, 80 surfing areas were surveyed. A refined Thailand-specific definition for surf tourism is suggested, reflecting the natural environment and the characteristics of the current surf tourists. The paper concludes by identiffing the future prospects, challenges, and related issues for sustainable surf tourism in Thailand...|$|E

40|$|The {{uniqueness}} {{theory of}} meromorphic functions studies the uniqueness conditions which can, to some extent, uniquely determine a meromorphic function. There are {{close relationship between}} uniqueness and sharing values. Early in 1926, R. Nevanlinna proved the four values theorem and five values theorems according to his value distribution theory of meromorphic functions. Since then, about for forty years, there appeared no any interesting results on value sharing of meromorphic functions or entire functions till 197 Os, Gross, Yang, Ozawa, etc. started the research on this field. They and their follows have been published many papers in uniqueness theory and value sharing by combining the classical function theory and the value distribution theory of meromorphic functions. Moreover, the concept of sharing values has been extended to that of sharing sets by Gross and Yang in 1970 s. They also introduced the concept of unique range set of entire functions or meromorphic functions, <b>idented</b> by URSE (URSM). The smallest cardinalities of a URSE or URSM becomes an interesting research problem and several related results were obtained by H. X. Yi, E. Mues, and Li-Yang. The present thesis will present several generalizations of four values theorem and five values theorem by combining sharing values, sharing sets and sharing pairs. For instance, we prove that if two nonconstant meromorphic functions f and g share four values and another finite set IM, then f and g share all values CM, thus g is a Mobius transformation of f. On the unique range set of meromorphic or entire functions, we will prove that the smallest cardinality of unique range sets is great {{than or equal to}} five. As a related topics, we have defined a new concept of uniqueness polynomial of meromorphic or entire functions and obtain a necessary and sufficient condition for a polynomial of degree 4 to be a uniqueness polynomial. Some questions deal with an entire function and its linear differential polynomial share two values IM also have been studied. Particularly, we present an affirmative answer to Frank's conjecture. We also prove that if an entire function f share two finite values CM jointly with its derivative f', then f ≡ f'...|$|E

Upon taking up office, Alan realised that a review needed {{to be carried out}} of the TWO. The research carried out a start of the review found that viewers saw the TWO as [...] "dull" [...] and [...] "Old Fashioned", with it having a highbrow effect. To rectify this, Lambie Nairn was hired to create a new identity. The 1986 <b>ident</b> was replaced by the start of the highly successful series of <b>idents</b> involving a sans serif '2'. The <b>idents</b> themselves were very simple, such as Paint or Water and this changed people's perception of the channel, despite the fact that only the <b>idents</b> had changed. These new 2's had corporate branding on BBC2 for the first time, allowing cross channel continuity to be easily done. It also brought a unified feel to the channel. These new <b>idents</b> also changed the style of <b>idents.</b> Previously the <b>ident</b> was a single scene that would introduce all types of programmes.
