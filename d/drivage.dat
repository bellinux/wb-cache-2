40|$|The {{execution}} of gas drainage techniques to degas the high methane content seams, {{and to allow}} their safe working, {{is influenced by the}} low permeability of the coal seams. The extraction techniques of coal degasification employed are; mining the underlying thin seam before extracting the main thicker target seam; pre-drainage of the target seam, from surface in conjunction with in-seam drainage, both using vacuum extraction and; taking a top lift of the very thick seams. A significant proportion of the liberated gas is also extracted from the goaf area. Several special techniques are employed in managing the goaf gas, including gas extraction from surface boreholes, bleeder <b>drivages</b> and gas drainage from roadways constructed above the extraction seam.

40|$|In {{recent years}} the <b>drivage</b> advance rates {{achieved}} within the UK coal industry have increased. In the 1980 's average <b>drivage</b> rates were 35 m per week compared to the 100 / 150 m per week possible today. These extended rates of advance have resulted {{in an increase in}} the potential methane, dust and heat generation within the vicinity of the <b>drivage</b> face. In order to effectively disperse this additional pollutant load a controlled increase in air quantity is required. Although advance rates have changed, current auxiliary ventilation practice has not. UK mining law requires that the fresh air must be delivered to within 5 m of the face. This has lead to the wide spread adoption of the use of overlap auxiliary systems within mechanised drivages, since a pure forcing system set at this distance from the face would lead to excessive airborne dust. UK mining law does not at present consider on-board mounted exhaust scrubber fans to constitute an effective overlap fan within mechanised drivages. Consequently an additional overlap exhaust fan is required to be installed within such drivages. In an attempt to determine whether working conditions could be safely and economically improved within mechanised rapid development drivages utilising an on-board mounted exhaust fan, a series of preliminary full scale gallery trials were conducted. A summary of the principal findings of these trials is presented together with an outline of a series of representative CFD simulations. This thesis examines the accuracy of CFD simulations for auxiliary ventilated headings. This is achieved by utilising Laser Doppler Anenometry (LDA) in a scale model representative of an underground heading and a detailed underground measurement programme conducted in production headings. These measured airflow values are then compared with representative CFD simulations and conclusion...|$|E

The underground mines are operated at shallow to moderate depths. Asia's largest and oldest underground manganese mine is being operated by MOIL at Balaghat, Madhya Pradesh. Horizontal cut and fill mining with passive timber square set support has been replaced with advanced technique of pre-mining support by Cable bolting for reinforcement underground structures. The change in technology has enabled to transform the manual post filling of rock to hydraulic sand stowing operation in all the underground mines of the MOIL. With the available underground stopes, the panel working has been started with phased mechanization. The Side discharge loaders (SDL) has been introduced for mechanical handling of ROM in the stope and Load, haul and dump (LHD) machines for <b>drivage</b> development. These rapid mining operations have imposed the need for change in level interval for higher productivity.

40|$|Large {{areas of}} ground are {{permanently}} supported on coal pillars, both in extensive old workings and current <b>drivages</b> in active mining operations. Continued growth of civil infrastructure is resulting in more surface development above old bord and pillar mines {{and an increased}} need for mine development beneath existing surface structures and features. The result is a greater likelihood of conflict between miners, developers and regulatory bodies. However, over the last 40 years {{there has also been}} significant improvement in the general level of understanding of pillar behaviour and stability, both in Australia and overseas. This paper examines some of the issues to be considered when undermining surface structures or undertaking surface development above old workings. The Factor of Safety (FoS) methodology widely employed for the assessment of pillar stability is reviewed, including the key geometrical, geological and statistical concepts associated with the probability of pillar failure; local and international experiences are examined and significant parameters isolated. Common concerns are addressed in the context of actual practical experience, utilising a risk management approach. Recent advances in methods for the assessment of pillar stability are put forward, along with criteria for arriving at rational design outcomes...|$|R
40|$|Drilling and {{blasting}} {{continues to}} be the predominant rock excavation technique in driving horizontal openings and tunnels for underground construction purpose. Faster <b>drivages,</b> attempted these days for reducing the long gestation periods of projects, have often resulted in large overbreak. This is due to the unacceptable levels of ground vibration to which the rock is subjected. Factors contributing to this include longer pulls; burn cuts, higher explosive per hole and per delay etc. Blast-induced rock damage (BIRD) assessment based on far-field peak particle velocity (PPV) measurement, when extrapolated near the face, has often resulted in suggesting higher PPV threshold levels. Apart from this the geological and structural features play a dominant role in masking the intensity of blast waves. Therefore, near-filed monitoring using accelerometers has been attempted in one of the metal mines to study the blast damage in faces excavated by burn cut. Present seismographs available have limited range (2540 mm/s) and are not suitable for near-field monitoring. This paper reports the investigations carried out for measuring acceleration, PPV and overbreak in a development heading for arriving at a suitable method of predicting blast-induced rock damage. The analysis of both acceleration and PPV measured against overbreak has revealed that rock damage is found to depend more on acceleration than PPV...|$|R
40|$|Roof {{conditions}} in coal mines {{of the southern}} Sydney Basin, Australia, are typically poor due {{to the effect of}} a relatively high horizontal in situ stress field (horizontal to vertical stress ratio (ơ 1 ơ 3) is approximately 2 / 1). The Permian Bulli Coal seam is mined from a portion of the basin which has undergone relatively little tectonic deformation apart from faulting and regional warping. The ơ 1 orientation acting on mine roadways is determined using the mining induced shear fractures and is comparable to results from in situ overcore measurements. The angle between ơ 1 and the mine roadway (0 sr) together with the ơ 1 magnitude and the ơ 1 /ơ 2 ratio defines the range of roof conditions to be expected in a mine roadway. A twelve point scale of stress induced roof failure has been developed to rank the severity of stress acting across the mine roadway. For a given stress field the roof conditions expected over the range of Osr is defined by a Roof Failure curve. A number of Roof Failure Curves are able to define roof conditions for a varying stress field. The distribution of Roof Failure Curves represents the relative changes in stress field intensity across the mapped area. Mapping techniques are able to show the variability of both relative stress field intensity and lateral stress field orientation. Successful management of the in situ stress effects in mine development <b>drivages</b> and around longwall blocks is crucial to the economic viability of coal mines in the southern Sydney Basin. To further understand the origin of the in situ stress field a technique was developed to measure strain anisotropy in the coal maceral vitrinite. Vitrinite mean maximum reflectance (Ŕo max), using oil immersion, was measured from oriented sections normal to bedding and results indicate that the vitrinite in medium volatile bituminous coals has biaxial optical properties.

40|$|Despite {{more than}} half a century of {{experience}} with roof bolting, no design method has received wide acceptance. To begin to improve this situation, National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) conducted a statistical study of roof bolt performance at a number of mines throughout the U. S. Case histories were collected from 37 mines with a variety of roof bolt types and patterns in a wide range of geologic environments.

The guidelines are based on the depth of cover (which correlates with stress) and the roof quality (measured by the Coal Mine Roof Rating (CMRR), and the intersection span.

In order to investigate the variables that contribute to roof falls, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) compiled a national database of roof performance from 37 coal mines.

40|$|Great {{consumption}} of coal {{has transformed the}} underground coal mining industry with new features. The first is the increasing depth of cover of coal mining operations due to shallow resources being exhausted. Some operations overseas have been operated at an overburden of more than 1300 meters. The second feature is the intensified production concentration associated with the greatly improved advancing rate of longwall faces； a single face output has reached more than 10 million tonnes per annum. Deep operations are exposed to a high ground stress regime, high gas content, and coal and gas outburst risk. These issues cause changes in mine design, including {{but not limited to}} high demand for stone roadways， which are more stable than coal ones under high ground stress conditions. Stone gate roads are needed to accommodate cross measure drilling to protect coal gate <b>drivage</b> from the risk of high gas emissions and outburst hazards. Increasing longwall face advancing rate shortens the lifespan of panels. Further, it necessitates short longwall development time to achieve smooth panel succession. Improved coal gate development and stone gate development are essential to fulfil this requirement. A Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM) is a kind of tunnel construction machinery which integrates the functions of excavation, ground support, mucking, lining， and surveying. It can achieve much higher heading rates than conventional drill and blast and roadheader methods, consequently, it has been proposed to be employed in underground coal mines to accommodate the requirement of high development rate...|$|E

The combined use of roof bolt and continuous miner systems has improved the face advance rate within rapid development drivages. In order to maintain adequate dust and gas control {{it is essential that}} the auxiliary ventilation and monitoring systems are correctly installed and maintained. The causes of many potential environmental hazards experienced within auxiliary ventilated rapid development drivages, are often attributed to a failure by the workforce and supervisory officials to maintain the correct installation, maintenance and operational standards of the ventilation and mining systems. The potential ventilation hazards encountered may include: the failure to deliver the required fresh air quantity and velocity to rapidly dilute and disperse methane gas liberated {{in the vicinity of the}} cutting face, or the failure to maintain sufficient exhaust air quantity in the vicinity of the cut to adequately capture dust produced on cutting and loading of the extracted mineral. Results of recent research studies have demonstrated that validated Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation models can adequately replicate examples of good and bad ventilation. CFD models may be constructed and solved to examine the relative ventilation benefits produced by alternative mining and auxiliary ventilation configurations. These models enable the practitioner to predict and visualise the velocity, pressure and contaminant fields within an auxiliary ventilated <b>drivage.</b> This research project has developed a prototype educational aid, which animates and visualises these airflow and pollutant dispersion patterns within a Virtual Reality (VR) model. By introducing a pollutant such as methane into the CFD models, the VR simulation highlights regions of potential methane concentration build-up to the trainee. The application also allows the user to select/investigate the environmental consequences of enacting a number of remedial actions...|$|E
40|$|Coal Operations Australia Limited Operates the Chain Valley, Wallarah and Moonee Collieries {{which are}} located in the Newcastle Coal Fields of New South Wales in the Catherine Hill Bay area {{approximately}} 100 km north of Sydney. Operations are in the Great Northern seam, which until recent years were all conducted under an immediate roof of a strong conglomerate. Large areas of the current reserves at all operations are in areas of a “claystone” immediate roof. All three mines have attempted at various stages of their history to find an economic mining method under these claystone roof conditions, with varying degrees of success at each operation. Moonee currently operates a longwall under claystone roof while Chain Valley and Wallarah are place-changing operations which have operated under claystone with some success. The nature of the “claystone” roof horizons in the three mines is often seen as different at each operation but in practice all of the claystones exhibit similar properties – low strength layers particularly at the coal-claystone interface. Strata control in conditions where the immediate roof above the coal seam is claystone appears to be most sensitive to coal beam thickness left as roof coal, roof bolting pattern and anchorage strength, <b>drivage</b> standards, horizontal stress direction, frequency and type of structures present, exposure time before bolting and possibly depth of cover. Coal beam thickness should be maximised wherever possible to achieve an optimum support density. Place-change mining using deep cuts up to 15 m has been successfully carried out under claystone and can be a productive mining method in this environment. There may be potential at Moonee Colliery to introduce place-changing as a method of remnant area mining or even as a gateroad development method. The most critical roof support issues in achieving high productivity under a claystone roof are the setting and maintenance of very high support installation standards {{and the development of a}} robust support management plan responsive to changes in strata conditions. This paper sets out to describe and discuss the various attempts to achieve economic success at each of the operations in a claystone roof environment...|$|E
