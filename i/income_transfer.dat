This program has been successful, and in 2004, roughly only 15% of corn imports are white corn –the one used for human consumption and the type that is mostly grown in Mexico– as opposed to 85% of yellow and crashed corn –the one use for feeding livestock, and which is barely produced in Mexico.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{investigated}} the relationship between social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> and the <b>income</b> security of the working poor. The specific {{aim of this study}} is to analyze the poverty reduction effect of social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> among the working poor from 1998 to 2005, during the pre NBLSA period (from 1998 to 2001) and the post NBLSA period (from 2002 to 2005). Particularly, this study compared the effect sizes of social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> and private <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> on poverty reduction. While the main target population of this study was the working poor, this study also examined poverty reduction of the non-working poor as well. ^ To achieve the study aim, this study used the Korean Labor and Income Panel Study (KLIPS), a nine-year panel dataset that includes 5, 000 households with 13, 300 individual cases. This study consists of cross-sectional macro-level analysis and longitudinal micro-level analysis. First, by employing a macro-level approach, this study examined the overall poverty reduction effectiveness of the current social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> among the working poor. Second, by employing a micro-level approach, this study also examined the impact of social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> and poverty reduction dynamics of individual households. ^ The results of the macro-level analysis supported most of the hypotheses. First of all, both social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> and private <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> have reduced the poverty rate and the aggregate poverty gap among the working poor as well as among the non-working poor over the nine-year period. The micro-level analysis identified elements affecting the poverty gap and the propensity to escape from poverty of individual households. ^ The empirical evidence indicates that the NBLSA has significantly improved the poverty reduction effect of social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> especially for the working poor. As such, it seems that the NBLSA has succeeded in accomplishing its intended goal, which was to expand the coverage of social welfare to the working poor. Another implication of the present study involves the family type and the effect of <b>income</b> <b>transfers.</b> As shown in micro-level analysis, while social <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> more effectively reduce the poverty gap among no children families, they are relatively less effective among two-parent with children families. ...|$|R

Contrary to previous studies, we find that more generous counties tend to do a better job of reducing poverty and that counties with more poor tend to be less generous, creating incentive for the poor to participate in the labor force.

40|$|Even in {{the current}} {{economic}} situation, in developed countries, rhetoric about cutting “poverty ” is misleadingly outmoded—because it implicitly suggests that government <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> can be the vehicle for achieving substantial reductions in poverty. Almost all Americans already live far above subsistence poverty: most because of their earnings, and the rest because of government transfer programs. This decline in material poverty is obscured by weaknesses in how the official U. S. poverty measure counts income. What is now called poverty is really “income inequality. ” Reducing income inequality is also a vitally important social goal, but it cannot be accomplished through <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> alone. The authors argue that, although <b>income</b> <b>transfers</b> {{have a role to}} play in lessening the impact of material deprivation, real progress in raising incomes will require building the human capital of the economically disadvantaged.
