METHODS: Dexamethasone/cyclodextrin (dexamethasone/CD) solid complex systems were prepared and characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR), differential scanning calorimetry (DSC), X-ray diffractometry (XRD), and by in vitro drug dissolution testing. Sample <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>suspensions</b> were prepared applying solubilizer/suspender consisting of γCD/HPγCD mixtures, poloxamer 407 (P 407) and polyvinylpyrrolidone. The <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>suspension</b> was characterized by its physicochemical properties. RESULTS: The solid characterization techniques applied suggested that solid complexes were being formed. The results indicated that dexamethasone formed non-inclusion or micelle-like aggregates with HPγCD and the γCD/HPγCD mixture. The dissolution and dexamethasone release from the solid dexamethasone/γCD/HPγCD complexes was much faster than from the solid dexamethasone/γCD and dexamethasone/HPγCD complexes. The diameter of the solid particles in the dexamethasone <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>suspension</b> formulations were in all cases less than 10 μm with a mean diameter from 2. 5 to 5. 8 μm. The particle size decreased with increasing amount of P 407. Permeation studies through semipermeable membrane and porcine sclera showed that increasing the amount HPγCD could enhance drug transport through the membrane barriers and this was related to enhanced drug solubility. The permeation rates were, however, decreased compared to formulation containing γCD alone due to larger hydrodynamic diameter of dexamethasone/γCD/HPγCD complex aggregates. All formulations were both chemically stable for at least 8 months at 25 °C and 40 °C. CONCLUSIONS: Combination of γCD and HPγCD, i. e., formation of dexamethasone/γCD/HPγCD complexes, resulted in synergistic effect. That is the mixture had greater solubilizing effect than the individual CD, resulted in enhanced dissolution and drug delivery through membranes. Furthermore, {{it is possible to}} control the drug release rate by adjusting the γCD:HPγCD ratio in the solid dexamethasone/γCD/HPγCD complexes...|$|R
40|$|Except for skin, {{the eye is}} {{the most}} easily {{accessible}} site for topical administration of a medication. Traditional topical ophthalmic formulations (<b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> and ointments) have poor bioavailability because of rapid pre-corneal elimination, conjunctival absorption, solution drainage by gravity, induced lacrimation and normal tear turnover. This leads to frequent installations of concentrated medication to achieve a therapeutic effect. The typical “pulse-entry” type drug release observed with ocular aqueous solutions (<b>eye</b> <b>drops),</b> <b>suspensions</b> and ointments can be replaced by more controlled, sustained, and continuous drug delivery, using a controlled-release ocular drug delivery system. Ocular inserts are solid or semisolid sterile preparations, of appropriate size and shape, designed to be inserted behind the eyelid or held on the eye and to deliver drugs for topical or systemic effect. These are polymeric systems into which the drug is incorporated as a solution or dispersion. They are better tolerated as to drainage and tear flow compared with other ophthalmic formulation and produce reliable drug release in the conjunctival cul-de-sac...|$|R
40|$|More {{and more}} people {{worldwide}} are affected by severe eye diseases eventually leading to visual impairment or blindness.

Therefore, research focuses on the development of new materials (e. g., for vitreous substitution) and more advanced drug delivery systems. Hydrogels are an extremely versatile class of materials with many potential applications in ophthalmology. They found widespread application as soft contact lenses, foldable intraocular lenses, in situ gelling formulations for ophthalmic drug delivery and ocular adhesives for wound repair; their use as vitreous substitutes and intravitreal drug delivery systems is currently under investigation.

Dexamethasone was formulated as somewhat water-soluble dexamethasone/gamma-cyclodextrin (gammaCD) microparticles in a low-viscosity aqueous <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> <b>suspension.</b> The mean (+/-standard deviation) diameter of the particles was 20. 4 +/- 10. 3 microm, with no particles larger than 60 microm. The aqueous suspension formulation was tested in rabbits and compared with an aqueous dexamethasone <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solution containing randomly methylated beta-cyclodextrin (RMbetaCD). The dexamethasone concentration was identical in both formulations (15 mg mL(- 1)). The drug was administered to the left eye but determined in both eyes. The amount reaching different eye tissues via the topical route was determined by subtracting the amount found in the right eye from the amount found in the left eye. Two hours after single application of the dexamethasone/gammaCD <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> to rabbits the mean (+/-s. d.) concentration in vitreous was 29 +/- 16 ng g(- 1), 86 % of which reached vitreous via the topical route and in retina the concentration was 57 +/- 22 ng g(- 1) (49 % via topical route). For the RMbetaCD the values were 22. 6 +/- 9 and 66 +/- 49 ng g(- 1) (73 and 14 % via topical route), respectively.

Topically applied carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (CAIs) in <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solutions are commonly used to treat glaucoma. However, local eye irritation and multiple daily administrations may hamper their clinical usefulness. Aqueous <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> formulations that improve their topical bioavailability and reduce their eye irritation can improve their clinical efficacy. Earlier studies showed that dorzolamide and closely related CAIs are more effectively delivered into the eye from acidic <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solutions than from comparable neutral solutions. Consequently, dorzolamide was marketed as an aqueous pH 5. 6 <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solution (Trusopt(®), Merck). Later, it was shown that increasing the pH of the <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> from pH 5. 6 to physiologic pH significantly reduced their local irritation. Earlier attempts to use cyclodextrins (CDs) as ocular penetration enhancers in dorzolamide <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> solutions failed since; although the CDs were able to enhance the aqueous solubility of dorzolamide, increasing the pH from 5. 6 to physiologic pH reduced {{the ability of the}} drug to permeate into the eye. Later, it was discovered that formulating the drug as aqueous dorzolamide/γCD <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> microparticle <b>suspension</b> resulted in significant bioavailability enhancement. The solid dorzolamide/γCD microparticles are mucoadhesive and release dorzolamide into the aqueous tear fluid for extended time period. Consequently, sustained high dorzolamide concentrations in aqueous humour and various eye tissues were observed after single administration of the aqueous dorzolamide/γCD <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> microsuspension. The microsuspension has a potential of being developed into a once-a-day <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> product.

Because clarithromycin ophthalmic formulations are not registered in Europe, we manufactured several extemporaneous ophthalmic formulations. DESIGN AND METHODS Six clarithromycin ophthalmic formulations were prepared aseptically: three clear <b>eye</b> <b>drops,</b> two ophthalmic <b>suspensions</b> and one ophthalmic ointment. In vitro efficacy was tested by inoculating agar plates with Moraxella catarrhalis and determining growth inhibition. Bonferroni adjusted one-way ANOVA was used to statistically compare growth inhibition of the ophthalmic solutions. Formulations were tested for pH, presence of particles, and osmolarity. RESULTS All six ophthalmic formulations resulted in significant growth inhibition of M. catarrhalis (P < 0. 001). Clear <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> based on clarithromycin powder for solution for injection performed best in terms of growth inhibition, followed by two <b>suspension</b> <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> and preserved <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> based on oral tablets (P < 0. 001). The preserved <b>eye</b> <b>drop</b> was the only ophthalmic formulation that met the ideal pharmaceutical criteria (pH 6. 9, osmolarity 0. 319 osmol/L). The patient’s ocular infection successfully resolved after intensive treatment with no significant residual ocular damage at two months. CONCLUSION Clear clarithromycin <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> based on oral tablets {{seem to be the}} most suitable ocular clarithromycin formulation: they showed excellent growth inhibition and met product specifications that are favourable for the prevention of ocular irritation. We therefore advocate the use of this extemporaneously prepared solution in absence of registered clarithromycin ophthalmic formulations or powder for solution for injection...|$|R

There was only culture medium in the upper chamber of the control group. The proliferation of rabbit's corneal epithelium was observed with CCK- 8 automated colorimetry and the expression of PCNA was detected by immunocytochemistry. We used the scratch wound assay to detect the migration of corneal epithelial cell(CEC).

40|$|Generally, {{we like to}} see ageing as {{a process}} that is {{happening}} to people older than ourselves. However the process of ageing impacts {{on a wide range of}} functions within the human body. Whilst many of the outcomes of ageing can now be delayed or reduced, age-related changes in cellular, molecular and physiological functionality of tissues and organs can also influence how drugs enter, distribute and are eliminated from the body. Therefore, the changing profile of barriers to drug delivery should be considered if we are to develop more age-appropriate medicines. Changes in the drug dissolution and absorption in older patients may require the formulation of oral delivery systems that offer enhanced retention at absorption sites to improve drug delivery. Alternatively, liquid and fast-melt dosage systems may address the need of patients who have difficulties in swallowing medication. Ageing-induced changes in the lung can also result in slower drug absorption, which is further compounded by disease factors, common in an ageing population, that reduce lung capacity. In terms of barriers to drug delivery to the eye, the main consideration is the tear film, which like other barriers to drug delivery, changes with normal ageing and can impact on the bioavailability of drugs delivery using <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> and <b>suspensions.</b> In contrast, whilst the skin as a barrier changes with age, no significant difference in absorption of drugs from transdermal drug delivery is observed in different age groups. However, due to the age-related pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic changes, dose adaptation should still be considered for drug delivery across the skin. Overall it is clear that the increasing age demographic of most populations, presents new (or should that be older) barriers to effective drug delivery. © 2012 Elsevier B. V.

The incidence and severity of superficial punctate keratitis (SPK), patient gender and age, type of glaucoma, and type of <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> were recorded. SPK was graded according to the AD (A, area; D, density) classification. The severity score (SS) was calculated from A &times; D. Results: SPK was observed in 382 (51. 0 %) of 749 eyes that had received any type of antiglaucoma <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> While 254 <b>eyes</b> (33. 9 %) were classified as A 1 D 1 (SS 1), 34 eyes (4. 6 %) had severe SPK with SS 4 or more. The number of <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> and the total dosing frequency per day were significantly greater in SPK-positive eyes than in eyes without SPK. The number of <b>eye</b> <b>drops</b> was proportional to the frequency and severity of SPK. Among eyes that were treated with three or more <b>eye</b> <b>drops,</b> SPK was more severe and more frequent in older patients (&ge; 71 years). In addition, a considerable difference was detected {{for each type of}} glaucoma. Conclusion: Drug-induced keratoepitheliopathy is often observed in eyes that have received recent antiglaucoma <b>eye</b> <b>drops.</b> The number of <b>eye</b> <b>drops,</b> the total dose frequency per day, patient age, and type of glaucoma may affect this condition. We have to consider not only the effects on intraocular pressure but also the incidence and severity of drug-induced keratoepitheliopathy as a frequent side effect of glaucoma medications.
