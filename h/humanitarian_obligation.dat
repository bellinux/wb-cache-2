Ambivalence or even hostility toward certain kinds of immigrants is not unusual in Australian history, as evident in the anti-Asian immigration policies of the former One Nation Party.

In our day, prevention of the proliferation of nuclear weapons {{has been one of the}} issues of international law. The present study is of crucial significance due to its endeavor to clarify the general principles of Humanitarian Law in a relationship to the threat of nuclear weapons' up to now, a special norm; significantly limiting or completely prohibiting the use of nuclear weapons, has not been accepted in international law. However, customary international humanitarian law regarding the use of nuclear weapons holds great value because of its purpose in eliminating nuclear weapons as a means of war through ascertaining their non-use and also appeasing the importance of nuclear ascendancy. In this respect, the NPT regime and its relationship with international humanitarian law will be discussed. Firstly, the NPT background, formation, main objectives and principles will be analyzed. In order to evaluate the relationship between the NPT and humanitarian law, the <b>humanitarian</b> <b>obligations</b> in general, <b>humanitarian</b> <b>obligations</b> in the context of the NPT and fulfillmen t of these obligations under the NPT should be studied.

40|$|Despite {{impressive}} worldwide {{improvements in}} oral health, inequalities in oral health status among and within countries remain a daunting public health challenge. Oral health inequalities arise from a complex web of health determinants, including social, behavioral, economic, genetic, environmental, and health system factors. Eliminating these inequalities cannot {{be accomplished in}} isolation of oral health from overall health, or without recognizing that oral health is influenced at multiple individual, family, community, and health systems levels.

Despite the global economic recession, there are trends that portend well for support of global health efforts: increased globalization of research and development, growing investment from private philanthropy, an absolute growth of spending in research and innovation, and an enhanced interest in global health among young people. More systematic and far-reaching efforts will be required to address oral health inequalities through the engagement of oral health funders and sponsors of research, with partners from multiple public and private sectors.

40|$|In {{the last}} decades {{trafficking}} in human being {{has become one of}} the most lucrative criminal enterprises all over the world, with strong links to other illegal activities, such as money laundering, drug trafficking, document forgery, and smuggling. The US Justice Department estimated that annually some 700, 000 women and children are bought, sold, transported and held in slavery-like conditions for sexual and labour exploitation. IOM estimates that around 120, 000 women and children are being trafficked into the European Union each year, primarily through the Balkans, and 10, 000 women, mostly from Moldova, Romania and Ukraine, are working only in the sex trade industry in Bosnia-Herzegovina. However, trafficking is not only a criminal act against human rights and dignity, but an ever increasing public health issue as it is stated in the Budapest Declaration adopted by the participants of the ministerial level Regional Conference on Public Health & Trafficking in Human Beings in Central, Eastern and Southeast Europe, held on 19 - 21 March 2003, in Budapest.

40|$|The basic {{tenets of}} the {{international}} refugee protection regime, {{set out in the}} UN 2 ̆ 7 s 1951 Convention and the 1967 Protocol, grant individuals the right to seek asylum, but do not provide for laws obliging signatory states to grant asylum. This inherent paradox allows signatory states ongoing manoeuvre to prevent would-be asylum seekers from accessing protection in their territories. To this end, countries of the global north have designed and implemented a range of measures aimed at deterring onshore asylum seekers - privileging border control over refugee protection. This paper examines the effectiveness of deterrence measures taken by Australia. It argues that deterrence measures and attendant political rhetoric are not only contrary to international <b>humanitarian</b> <b>obligations,</b> but obscure empirically grounded understandings of forced migration as a complex social phenomenon, and as such are problematic in terms of meeting their publicly stated objectives of stopping on-shore asylum seeking in the long term...|$|R

From this analysis stems the argument is that while the governments of the wealthy Western states are often amongst the loudest trumpeters of humanitarian principles, they fail to live up to their <b>humanitarian</b> <b>obligations.</b> For, rather than committing to humanitarian action on the basis of need, they are only willing to commit to humanitarian action in cases that serve in their own national interests; cases of human suffering from which they do not stand to benefit remain caught in the margins of the international humanitarian regime...|$|R
40|$|This report {{looks at}} the {{experiences}} of refugee communities in Tasmania against the Department of Immigration’s criteria for successful settlement for new entrants, which has as a broad goal the full economic and social participation of new entrants. Many aspects of life in Tasmania suit refugee communities and promote good settlement outcomes – this includes a mixture of community support, and state and commonwealth funded services. In 2000 Anglicare examined the settlement experiences of refugee communities in Tasmania. That report found major service gaps after the initial period of settlement and that the steady outflow of new entrants to the mainland was due to employment and community development needs. Seven years later the service system has changed dramatically {{as a consequence of}} both redesign and competitive tendering, with those services offered past an initial six months of support now focussed on those refugees deemed to be ‘most in need’. The social environment has also changed. There have been an increased number of refugee arrivals and a shift to source countries in the Middle East and Africa. These refugees are more visibly different than some previous refugee groups. At the same time, at a political level, public discourse about refugees has been dominated by muddy definitional debates about ‘legal’ and ‘illegal’ refugees with an increased public resentment towards those deemed to be ‘illegal’. And these shifts in immigration policy have coincided with a time of great social stress for low income Australians. At a community level it has been a time of rising costs of living, with low income Tasmanians in desperate competition for public housing and affordable private rental properties. While the Tasmanian economy has prospered, long-term unemployment rates have remained high with pathways out of unemployment limited for people with literacy and numeracy issues. Further, Job Network providers in this state appear to still be struggling {{to meet the needs of}} humanitarian entrants. Refugees continue to point to settlement service gaps beyond the period of eligibility for intensive settlement services. These are keenly felt as they struggle with their over-riding concerns about unemployment, their inability to get stable housing and their experiences of racial tension in the Tasmanian community. In particular, refugees are falling through gaps between settlement service and housing service providers, and their housing problems are undermining settlement outcomes for them by failing to provide security of tenure or housing that is accessible to the services they must use. In some cases this has resulted in them ending up in Government-funded crisis housing, financial stress, and struggling with the social isolation caused by frequent moves and the disconnection of community networks. It appears that the current system will only provide the security of public housing to refugees when they are reduced to homelessness rather than as part of Australia’s <b>humanitarian</b> <b>obligation</b> to settlement. Perhaps consciousness of Tasmania’s history of warmly welcoming refugees has made Tasmanian authorities minimise the disturbing swell of racism in the community, particularly when part of a context of general anti-social behaviour by white youth. However, interviews with members of the refugee community make it clear that this behaviour exacerbates post-traumatic stress for its victims and can and does escalate to acts of violence directed at new entrants. Anglicare proposes a range of recommendations to address the substantial problems outlined above. Some of these draw on existing initiatives, others on models found to be successful in other jurisdictions. All of them draw on the considerable pool of expertise and stories of success that exist among the refugee communities, settlement services and community service providers...|$|E
30|$|The above discussions {{aimed to}} outline a {{prevalent}} and persistent challenge faced during non-international armed conflicts. The humanitarian crises being suffered {{by so many}} may be mitigated to some extent through the imposition of (temporary) human rights obligations on NSAGs. As well as remedying to a degree the inequality of obligations and human rights protection, human rights norms {{could be used to}} compliment and build upon <b>humanitarian</b> <b>obligations</b> of all parties to non-international armed conflicts. Current initiatives that have been taken to try to alleviate the human cost of armed conflicts, including action plans, the ‘list of shame’ and deeds of commitment, have had some success in governing the behaviour of NSAGs. Nonetheless, large lacunas exist. This is particularly with regard to the ability of the initiatives to tackle human rights protection. For this reason, a possible additional and complementary measure that could be taken is to include some subsistence rights obligations in short-term ceasefire agreements. This envisages giving human rights a larger role in the governance of NSAGs. Whilst not constituting a perfect solution, the agreements could prove to be a way of ameliorating situations of humanitarian crisis without requiring an unreasonable burden on the international community.|$|R
40|$|This {{article is}} {{concerned}} with the way Maritime Asylum Seekers (MAS) were constructed as a problem and negatively framed during the 2010 Australian Federal Election. It draws upon a comparative study of the representations of MAS in the 2001 and the 2010 election campaigns, through an analysis of election-seeking officials’ rhetoric and use of symbols, and the portrayal of the issue in select newspapers. It asserts that the construction of MAS as a problem has commonly been addressed within a broad ‘securitization’ framework or through explanation of MAS as ‘the other’, but that neither of those frameworks adequately explains that the issue involves pertinent <b>humanitarian</b> <b>obligations.</b> It introduces the concept of the ‘reverse humanitarian’ framework, and suggests that actors have used this framework to demonize and dehumanize MAS within the very framework that is supposed to provide protection. It suggests that the ‘reverse humanitarian’ framework better explains how the election-seeking officials in 2010 constructed MAS as ‘undeserving’ refugees, and also how select mainstream media challenged these constructions. Ultimately what the study shows is that rather than offer leadership on the issue, the election-seeking officials relied on the political opportunities of negatively constructing MAS. Such a finding emphasizes the need for leadership on issues of humanitarian concern...|$|R
40|$|This thesis employs {{discourse}} analysis {{to examine the}} human rights contradictions contained in the Common European Asylum System (CEAS). It follows {{the development of the}} CEAS since its inception in 1999. However, the principal emphasis of the thesis falls on the scope for realising a rights-based asylum regime in the post-Lisbon context. The research takes the form of policy analysis, and is grounded in a human rights framework of inquiry. This human rights perspective is used to examine the normative and legal inconsistencies inherent to the EU’s securitised approach to asylum, and to put forward suggestions for an approach to asylum in the EU, which engenders a rights-based approach to protection. The analysis of contemporary EU asylum policy and practice demonstrates the extent to which securitisation is present in EU asylum policymaking. It shows that, until the security paradigm in this policy area is supplanted, the realisation of a rights-based asylum system in the EU will not be possible. It also addresses the further challenges to the realisation of the EU as a ‘single asylum space,’ which stem from the limitations in the current instruments of the acquis, most notably the absence of burden-sharing mechanisms to ensure that the EU’s <b>humanitarian</b> <b>obligations</b> are shared equally amongst Member States. The recent ratification of the Treaty of Lisbon holds significant potential {{for the development of a}} rights-based asylum regime in the EU.

40|$|This essay {{examines}} the measures adopted {{under the auspices}} of the European Union (EU) to respond to the phenomenon of unauthorized migrations, in the form of both the establishment of naval operations and the decisions adopted following relevant meetings of the European Council and of the Council of the European Union. The analysis shows that, while in an earlier phase of the process towards the Europeanization of migration policies the naval operations in the Mediterranean sea found their roots in a unilateral operation characterized by a fundamentally humanitarian purposes (the Italian Mare Nostrum operation), they have later evolved in a EU mission (Triton) mostly aimed at controlling the EU’s boundaries at sea, with the recently lunched EuNavfor Med operation representing a stiffening of this defensive approach. The article argues that the focus has shifted towards the protection of the European borders, with a progressively reduced space for the protection of refugees pursuant to <b>humanitarian</b> <b>obligations.</b> Some critical considerations are also proposed with regard to the effectiveness and efficiency of the measures adopted by the Members of the EU to date, which, in the author's view, the European countries approved with difficulty and discordantly, in clear contrast with the principle of solidarity, which is at the foundation of the Treaty of Lisbon. The essay concludes by arguing that this piecemeal and incomplete response to a phenomenon as complex as migration, focussed as it is on curing its symptoms instead of its root causes, cannot represent a valid remedy. The author further suggests that, rather than opting for the use of force at sea or in the territory of the States in distress from where the migration originates, Europe should urgently set itself to lead the process towards peace, liberty and human dignity, including by means of a robust relocation programme as well as immediate support in the countries of emigration...|$|R
40|$|In {{exploring}} how to decisively address global poverty {{the question}} of what should be the content of nations’ global justice duties has been debatable. Nationalism has usually been regarded as incompatible with cosmopolitanism. It is against extending principles of social justice to the entire globe as cosmopolitanism demands {{on the grounds that the}} global context lacks the special attachments that generate national solidarity which is regarded as what ensures distributive justice realizable. For nationalism there cannot be motivation for global distributive justice since this solidarity is only national. As such the nationalist perspective holds that only <b>humanitarian</b> <b>obligations</b> constitute global justice duties. Nationalists also restrict global justice duties to humanitarian assistance due to the fact that nations have a moral obligation to respect another nation’s political culture’s values manifested in the type of national policies they pursue. For nationalists fulfilling the moral requirement of mutual respect of nations’ political cultures would entail letting nations face the consequences of their preferred choices which in some cases lead to poverty. Only when a humanitarian crisis looms do other nations have moral obligations of helping out. Cosmopolitanism agrees with the idea of respecting nations’ right to self-determination and letting nations face consequences of their choices. However it demands the precondition that the background context in which the self-determination is exercised should be just and fair. This demands that before nations respect poor nations’ political cultures the global cooperation which interferes with the exercise of self-determination should be rid of its interference tendencies that negatively restrict nations’ choices. It further demands that nations’ political cultures that are harmful to individuals by subjecting them to poverty ought to be reformed. What cosmopolitanism demands is that there should be a new understanding of nationalism with respect to the individual as the ultimate unit of moral concern. It also regards the lack of solidarity on the globe context as a resolvable challenge that would be faced in the implementation of global justice in the non-ideal real life. It does not in any way invalidate the moral worth of cosmopolitan principles of justice...|$|R
40|$|The {{collapse}} of Nazi Germany {{was accompanied by}} a humanitarian disaster of staggering proportions. The newly-founded United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration (UNRRA) and its successor the International Refugee Organization (IRO) identified repairing the damage that the war had inflicted on Allied displaced populations as one of its foremost <b>humanitarian</b> <b>obligations.</b> These UN agencies cast themselves as pre-eminent agents of ‘rehabilitation’, facilitating a fast transition from war to peace through scientific methods of refugee management conducted along Rooseveltian lines. Departing from earlier relief efforts, their ambition was to provide more than a mere ‘soup kitchen’ charity, their aim being to ‘rehabilitate’ Displaced Persons (DPs). Their methods were, however, vigorously contested in the field by military and occupation authorities, by members of established voluntary societies, and by UNRRA/IRO’s own continental recruits. This thesis explores these confrontations through the lens of French DP administration. Although these UN agencies proclaimed a new era of internationalism, solutions to DP problems were often defined in nationalist terms. DPs were organised by ethnicity and strong ties attached relief workers to their own national groups. For French planners and humanitarian workers, the DP question was much more than a humanitarian problem, and was bound up with issues of domestic reconstruction, culture and identity as much as the provision of medical aid and relief. This thesis demonstrates that distinctive diplomatic constraints, economic requirements and cultural differences influenced the thought and practices of refugee humanitarianism, shaping alternate ways of arranging interim provision and ‘rehabilitating’ DPs in the French zone of occupation. Despite the fact that Allied responses to the DP problem mirrored divergent wartime experiences and differing national visions for the post-war future, this thesis argues that the history of UNRRA and the IRO in the French zone cannot be solely understood as a story of inter-Allied confrontation and clashes of political culture. Numerous transfers of expertise and the circulation of ideas and people between the zones belie such a view. New-Deal influenced methods penetrated the French zone and local UNRRA/IRO staff progressively embraced the organizations’ declared mission of ‘self-help’, albeit on terms that reflected their particular interpretation of DPs’ best interests. The real impact of UNRRA and the IRO lies in this grey area of subtle processes of imitation and re-interpretation. Art and Humanities Research Counci...|$|R
40|$|The {{debate about}} the {{regional}} settlement of refugees takes place within {{a number of important}} and at times conflicting policy arenas: <b>humanitarian</b> goals and <b>obligations,</b> population strategy and economic development of regional areas. In a paper for the Australian Social Policy Conference 2005, Janet Taylor discusses a recent Brotherhood of St Laurence study to explore the settlement experiences of two recent refugee groups (Iraqi and Sudanese) in selected areas of regional Victoria. Both the federal and the state governments have been developing policies to encourage refugees to settle in regional areas to assist the newcomers gain employment and to help build regional economies. While this sounds like a win-win scenario, the reality is more complex, writes Janet Taylor. The {{debate about the}} regional settlement of refugees takes place within a number of important and at times conflicting policy arenas: <b>humanitarian</b> goals and <b>obligations,</b> population strategy and economic development of regional areas. Matters of concern include the nature of the refugee experience; the special needs of refugees as distinct from migrants; the availability of employment and support services; and the capacity of regional communities to build ties with newcomers of different backgrounds. In the context of these policy issues, the Brotherhood of St Laurence has undertaken a recent study to explore the settlement experiences of two recent refugee groups (Iraqi and Sudanese) in selected areas of regional Victoria (Shepparton, Colac and Warrnambool) and to examine factors that promote settlement in such areas. This paper for the Australian Social Policy Conference 2005 outlines changes in policy over recent years, presents the findings of the Brotherhood 2 ̆ 7 s study and considers implications for future policy...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} state foreign responses to violations of {{international humanitarian law}} in African civil wars. Its central concern is with {{the extent to which}} international <b>humanitarian</b> law <b>obligations</b> shape state foreign policy decisions, as opposed to calculations of narrow national interests. I first set out the legal <b>obligations</b> that international <b>humanitarian</b> law places on states in the event of civil wars in other states. In other words, what legal theory expects of states as parties to international humanitarian law agreements. I then develop a theoretical framework of state foreign policy decision-making as a two-level game, where domestic and international pressures shape foreign policy decisions. I analyze how the interaction between various actors at both levels (domestic and international) influences state foreign policy. ^ Through process tracing, I examine actual state foreign policy responses to five cases of African civil wars between 1990 and 2006 : Somalia, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Democratic Republic of Congo and Darfur, Sudan. I argue that state calculations of narrow national interests explain better why states responded the way they did, and that international legal obligation was of marginal relevance. I conclude the study with the implications of these findings to the future management of African civil wars, and to the broader understanding of state foreign policy responses to human rights violations abroad. ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} scope and limits of Article 4 (h) of the AU Act in order to {{generate}} new thinking on, and contribute a fresh legal approach to, {{the implementation of the}} AU’s right to intervene under Article 4 (h). While Article 4 (h) intervention can be construed as enforcement by consent, {{it is not clear whether}} the UN Charter provides for enforcement action by consent to be outside the purview of Article 53 (1) of the UN Charter. Thus, Article 4 (h) intervention without authorisation of the UN Security Council faces legal challenges in view of Article 103 of the UN Charter and Article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which stipulates that a treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a jus cogens norm. However, Article 4 (h) can be interpreted as a general a priori invitation in the form of a treaty-based intervention to prevent or halt mass atrocity crimes, which are of legitimate concern to the international community, and give rise to prosecution under the principle of universal jurisdiction. Nevertheless, measures to ensure the observance of the law in prospect, rather than intervention and penalisation of violations after the fact are worthwhile in preventing violations given the financial and institutional incapacity of the AU. Hence the need for ‘persuasive prevention’ to deter potential perpetrators and ensure compliance of human rights and <b>humanitarian</b> law <b>obligations...</b>|$|R
40|$|Starting with {{peaceful}} {{protests of}} people demanding democratic reforms and fundamental rights from {{the regime in}} Damascus, the Syria crisis developed into a full-fledged civil war causing largescale death, injury, and displacement. During {{the first year of}} the crisis, violence in Syria was marked by the brutal crackdown of regime forces on protesters. Confronted with a high degree of violence from state forces, opposition groups gradually organized politically and militarily. This article focuses on international legal obligations of armed opposition groups in the course of this crisis. Such obligations are clearly contained in international humanitarian law, and arguably also in international human rights law. In order to determine the applicable law, the classification of the situation as either an armed conflict or one of internal tensions and disturbances is fundamental but controversial. This article examines at what stage of the crisis international human rights <b>obligations</b> and international <b>humanitarian</b> law <b>obligations</b> of non-state armed groups became pertinent, and provides reasons why this is the case. It shall be argued that even before the Syria crisis turned into a non-international armed conflict, opposition groups were bound by fundamental rules of international human rights law. In addition to these rules, all parties to the armed conflict became bound by international humanitarian law once the situation reached a sufficient degree of violence, and the non-state groups a sufficient degree of organization. By examining the Syria crisis, this article shall show what these abstract criteria mean in practice...|$|R
