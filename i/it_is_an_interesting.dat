25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> {{butterfly}} {{in that it}} has {{a number}} of modes of flight. In the cool of the morning, the flight is slow considering that it is an edible and unprotected swallowtail. As the day progresses, it flies fast, straight and low. In the hotter part of the day, it may be found settling on damp patches where it will remain motionless, except for an occasional flutter of wings, if not disturbed.|$|E
25|$|This largely {{morphological}} {{program of}} comparative anatomy {{remained at the}} core of most biological education for a hundred years until the advent of cell and molecular biology and interest in evolutionary ecology forced a fundamental rethink. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> fact that the methods of the field naturalists who led the way in developing the theory of evolution (Darwin, Wallace, Fritz Müller, Henry Bates) were scarcely represented at all in Huxley's program. Ecological investigation of life in its environment was virtually non-existent, and theory, evolutionary or otherwise, was at a discount. Michael Ruse finds no mention of evolution or Darwinism in any of the exams set by Huxley, and confirms the lecture content based on two complete sets of lecture notes.|$|E

500|$|A {{heritage}} {{review of}} the bridges of County Offaly in 2005 described Banagher Bridge as of national heritage significance, of high architectural merit and demonstrative of mid-19th century construction work by a government body. It states [...] "This is the only six-arch masonry span in the county. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> contrast with the 1750s bridge at Shannonbridge. Although both are approximately the same length, Banagher Bridge achieves the crossing with fewer spans (six as opposed to 16). It also has the longest masonry arch spans of all the county's bridges, averaging 17.88m".|$|E
500|$|The {{relationship}} between Johnson and Chinn shows the contradictions within slavery at the time. For one, {{not only does}} it indicate that even then that [...] "kin could also be property," [...] but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> case because Johnson was open about his relationship with Chinn, calling her [...] "my bride" [...] on at least one occasion, with both of them acting like a married couple, and oral tradition recalling that other slaves at Great Crossings worked on their wedding. As part of their relationship, Chinn gained more responsibilities. As she spent much of her time in the [...] "plantation's big house," [...] a two-story brick home, she managed Johnson's estate for at least half of each year, with her purview later expanding to all of his property, even acting as [...] "Richard's representative" [...] and allowing her to handle money. This gave, as historical scholar Christina Snyder argues, some independence, since Johnson told his white employees that Chinn's authority must be respected, and her role allowing her children's lives to be different from [...] "others of African descent at Great Crossings," [...] giving them levels of privileged access within the plantation. This was further {{complicated by the fact that}} Chinn was still enslaved but supervised the work of slaves, with the Chinn family never sold or mortgaged off, but she did not have the power to [...] "challenge the institution of slavery or overturn the government that supported it," [...] she only had the power to gain some personal autonomy, with Johnson never legally emancipating her. This may have been because, as Snyder says, liberating her from human bondage would erode [...] "ties that bound her to him" [...] and keeping her enslaved supported his idea of being a [...] "benevolent patriarch." ...|$|E
500|$|Stakes was {{met with}} mostly {{positive}} reviews, although a few commentators felt that the miniseries did not meet expectations. Charlie Jane Anders of io9 applauded the miniseries, noting that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> meditation {{on the concept of}} change, as well as the on philosophical idea that everything is cyclical. In regards to the art and direction of the miniseries, Anders wrote: [...] "There is so much insane gorgeous imagery in this , including a ton of really fantastic dream sequences. This show is really pushing its limits in terms of pure visual artistry." [...] Anders noted that, while some fans of the show have been suffering from [...] "Adventure Time fatigue"—largely {{based on the belief that}} the show has not moved forward since Finn met his father—Stakes [...] "really feels like a rejoinder to the people who complain the show isn’t moving fast enough with its plots". Writing for Vox, Todd VanDerWerff wrote highly of the miniseries, arguing that it was an excellent example of the coming-of-age story that [...] "shows off the kids series' emotional maturity". He did note that the miniseries is [...] "less a cohesive whole than a bunch of short stories that feel as if they accidentally add up to something bigger", and that the need for every installment to exist as a self-contained unit made Stakes [...] "a little clunky". With that being said, he felt that it ended up being [...] "suitably epic" [...] and [...] "rich with metaphor". Ultimately, VanDerWerff felt that the moral message of the miniseries was: [...] "Change is good. Growth is good. Supporting others' growth is good. And accepting others when they need to change is the best thing you can do." ...|$|E

500|$|Carla Gugino {{revealed}} in August 2009 {{that she had}} begun taking singing lessons for her part in the film. One month later, Jamie Chung announced {{in an interview with}} E! Entertainment that recording for the soundtrack had begun. When Emily Browning auditioned for her role as Babydoll, Snyder asked her to sing because of the musical element in the film. He told her to record herself while singing, and the actress did a version of [...] "Killing Me Softly with His Song". Browning later said, [...] "I was terrified, of course. But he liked it. I have no idea why, but he thought me capable of carrying a tune on the screen." [...] The crew liked the result and offered her to sing more songs. At first it was just a cover of [...] "Where Is My Mind?" [...] by Pixies, which ended up becoming a duet with Yoav, but the producers extended to three songs. One, a version by [...] "Sweet Dreams (Are Made of This)" [...] by Eurythmics, is used to open the movie, and Bates noted that [...] " [...] first line of dialogue is actually 27 minutes into the film so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> way to introduce her character." [...] The other came up when during a discussion on her favorite music with Snyder, Browning said that The Smiths was her favorite band. Several weeks later, Snyder informed her that he had acquired the rights to The Smiths' song [...] "Asleep", and asked her if she would like to perform the lead vocals. At first, she hesitated, saying that [...] "The offer was flattering, but there was so much pressure". However, she recorded the song and according to Snyder, The Smiths' frontman Morrissey was happy with the result. Regarding Browning's performance, de Vries considered that [...] "having Emily sing—essentially commenting in song on her character’s situation in the film — provided an interesting texture, real resonance and depth, and tied the music to the visuals in a way that might otherwise not have been so clearly defined", and Snyder found the actress' [...] "emotional delivery" [...] to [...] "make the songs even more poignant". To work with Browning between takes, de Vries used a portable recording rig on a room with a piano - [...] "a very distressed, out-of-tune, almost-unusable instrument (...) which turned out to have real charm in it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Indeed, the {{historical}} developments surrounding {{the formation of}} Ekiti towns and villages {{were based on the}} fact that most settlements had witnessed different stages of dispersal in human settlement, break-apart, dislocation or relocation of towns, migration and the arrival of new settlers shortly before, during and after the Yoruba wars of the 19th century. [...] However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> fact that these towns and communities live close-by without capacity to dominate or obliterate each other and they tend to preserve their autonomy as distinct groups with separate traditional institution while professing same kinship (homogeneity) and sub-ethnic identity.|$|E
2500|$|The {{pairing of}} Marie with {{the figure of}} Force gives power {{to the image of}} the queen, while Marie's actual pose is more passive, showing very {{effectively}} her graceful acknowledgement of her son's authority henceforth. [...] <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> painting to examine {{within the context of the}} tense relationship between the young king and his mother. [...] Marie had clung to power past the end of her regency, until Louis seized power in 1617 and exiled her to Blois. [...] Rubens obviously would have known this and so chose to ignore the tension surrounding Marie's relationship with her son, instead emphasizing her poise in the transfer of power.|$|E

2500|$|Early royal {{inscriptions}} {{from the}} third millennium BCE mention [...] "the reeds of Enki". Reeds were an important local building material, used for baskets and containers, and collected outside the city walls, where the dead or sick were often carried. This links Enki to the Kur or underworld of Sumerian mythology. In another even older tradition, Nammu, the goddess of the primeval creative matter and the mother-goddess portrayed as having [...] "given birth to the great gods," [...] {{was the mother of}} Enki, and as the watery creative force, was said to preexist Ea-Enki. Benito states [...] "With Enki <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> change of gender symbolism, the fertilising agent is also water, Sumerian [...] "a" [...] or [...] "Ab" [...] which also means [...] "semen". In one evocative passage in a Sumerian hymn, Enki stands at the empty riverbeds and fills them with his 'water'". This may be a reference to Enki's hieros gamos or sacred marriage with Ki/Ninhursag (the Earth) (see below).|$|E
2500|$|The New Zealand Herald {{gave the}} album {{four out of}} four stars upon the album 2009 release, noting that Q-Tip [...] "came up with {{something}} timeless then – and nine years on it sounds fresh, inventive and cosmic", and adding that the album has a [...] "unique coolness to it and it still sounds {{ahead of its time}} in 2009". However, Robert Christgau named it [...] "dud of the month" [...] in his consumer guide for MSN Music, in which he wrote that most of the tracks are musically incomplete and, [...] "in the narrow sense of rhythm tracks, the beats have some ass to them, but as music they revert to fusion kitsch whenever the artiste sees an opening". Pitchfork critic David Drake commented that [...] "Kamaal the Abstract is not a great record by any means. But <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>an</b> <b>interesting</b> one, a unique effort by an artist struggling to mesh [...] ", viewing that [...] "each track is a loose framework of unfulfilled promise". William Grant of Drowned in Sound viewed that it [...] "seems a bit aimless at times", but ultimately praised its diverse sound and gave it an eight out of 10 rating. Dave Heaton of PopMatters commented that the album is [...] "mainly about feeling. There’s no storytelling meat to the songs, less wit, not much of Q-Tip’s creative approach to language. It’s mostly about riding the groove, and that Q-Tip does well".|$|E
