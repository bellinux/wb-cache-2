5|$|Scotland's {{populations of}} Alpine Woodsia and Oblong Woodsia {{are on the}} edge of their natural ranges. The UK {{distribution}} of the former <b>is</b> <b>confined</b> to Angus, Perthshire, Argyll and north Wales, and of the latter to Angus, the Moffat Hills, north Wales and two locations in England. The plants were first identified as separate species by John Bolton in 1785 and came under severe threat from Victorian fern collectors in the mid 19th century. Cystopteris dickieana, first discovered in a sea cave in Kincardineshire, is a rare fern in a UK context whose distribution <b>is</b> <b>confined</b> to Scotland, although recent research suggests that it may be a variant of C. fragilis rather than a species in its own right.|$|E

Here, as a higher dimensional generalization of these, we show that Yang-Mills instantons can <b>be</b> <b>confined</b> by monopole-strings in d= 4 + 1. We achieve this by putting the system into the Higgs phase in which the configuration can be constructed inside a non-Abelian vortex sheet. Comment: 15 pages, 2 figures, v 2 : published versio...|$|R

5|$|Observations of Io by {{spacecraft}} and Earth-based {{astronomers have}} led to the identification of differences in the types of eruptions seen on the satellite. The three main types identified include intra-patera, flow-dominated, and explosion-dominated eruptions. They differ in terms of duration, energy released, brightness temperature (determined from infrared imaging), type of lava flow, and whether it <b>is</b> <b>confined</b> within volcanic pits.|$|E

5|$|Asiatic cheetah (A. j. venaticus) (Griffith, 1821): Also {{called the}} Iranian or Indian cheetah. Formerly {{occurred}} across the Middle East, Central Asia and the Indian subcontinent. According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN), it <b>is</b> <b>confined</b> to Iran, {{and is thus}} the only surviving cheetah subspecies indigenous to Asia. It has been classified as Critically Endangered. A 2004 study estimated the total population at 50 to 60. Later, a 2007 study gave the total population in Iran as 60 to 100; the majority of individuals {{were likely to be}} juveniles. The population has declined sharply since the mid-1970s. As of 2012, only two captive individuals are known.|$|E
5|$|Bogbean and Water Lobelia {{are common}} plants of moorland pools and lochans. The Least (Nuphar pumila), Yellow and White Water-lilies are also widespread. Pipewort has {{generated}} some botanical controversy regarding its discovery, classification and distribution.
