40|$|Twenty-five {{strains of}} <b>enterotoxigenic</b> (tox+) <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> {{isolated}} in India, Bangladesh, and the U. S. A. {{were shown to}} produce vascular permeability factor (PF) activity as well as diarrheagenic activity. Sixteen strains of non-enterotoxigenic E. coli {{were found to be}} PF negative. The PF response elicited by tox+E. coli isolated in the U. S. A. from cases of infantile diarrhea was qualitatively different and more difficult to demonstrate. However, this problem was surmounted by assaying 25 -fold concentrates of the crude enterotoxin of these strains. PF activity of various strains of tox+E. coli was neutralized by anti-PF antiserum prepared against the enterotoxin of strain H- 10407. This anti-PF antiserum also neutralized PF activity of Vibrio cholerae enterotoxin (choleragen). Antiserum containing antibody specific for purified choleragen neutralized E. coli PF activity. These and other results indicate that the PF activity of E. coli {{is a function of the}} diarrheagenic enterotoxin as is known to be the case with choleragen. We conclude that the PF assay can be employed for the identification of tox+E. coli and for the detection of antitoxic antibody...|$|R

50|$|The {{most common}} causative agent {{isolated}} in countries surveyed has been <b>enterotoxigenic</b> <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> (ETEC). Enteroaggregative E. coli is increasingly recognized. Shigella spp. and Salmonella spp. are other common bacterial pathogens.

The bacteria <b>enterotoxigenic</b> <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> (ETEC) are typically the most common except in Southeast Asia, where Campylobacter is more prominent.

40|$|The {{finding that}} <b>enterotoxigenic</b> (ET) <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli</b> strains from many {{geographic}} areas {{belong to a}} limited number of serogroups led investigators to hope that polyvalent antisera could be used to screen for ET E. coli in areas of the world where more complicated tests of toxigenicity are not available. We compared the serotypes of 207 ET E. coli strains obtained from patients attending the Dhaka Hospital of the International Centre for Diarrhoeal Disease Research, Bangladesh, in 1980 with results obtained from similar surveys conducted in 1976 and 1978. During that time the distribution of serogroups changed significantly so that only 46 % of our strains had O serogroups included in the polyvalent antisera capable of detecting 66 % of ET E. coli strains in 1978. O 167, a serogroup which was not included previously, was the third most common serogroup in our study. These findings suggest that polyvalent antisera used to screen for ET E. coli need to be reassessed over time as well as in different geographic areas and may not be as useful for field diagnosis as was originally hoped...|$|R

The medium components did not support production of heat-labile enterotoxin (LT) but were similar for ST synthesis by ENT+ strains producting only ST and those which produced ST in addition to LT. The amino acids in Casamino Acids found to be necessary for growth and enterotoxin synthesis were proline, serine, aspartic acid, and alanine. Maximal growth and toxin levels were obtained after 8 h of incubation. Improved growth, but not an increase in synthesis of ST, was observed {{in the presence of}} Mg 2 +, Mn 2 + and Fe 3 + compared with Mg 2 + alone. A chelator, tricine, was necessary for maximal cell densities,, probably to solubilize trace ions and make them more available to the bacteria.

Results showed that E. coli responds to the estuarine diurnal solar cycle by entering the viable but nonculturable state upon exposure to sunlight.

The effect of sunlight on the pathogenicity of E. coli H 10407 was studied, using both the rabbit intestinal loop assay and ganglioside-enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (GM 1 -ELISA), a sensitive procedure for testing for production of enterotoxin. Results of the GM 1 -ELISA demonstrated that strains of E. coli, after exposure to sunlight and entering the viable but nonculturable state, as well as culturable E. coli, retained pathogenicity, i. e., produced enterotoxin.

40|$|Sources of viscous soluble fibre, such as barley and oats, {{have often}} been {{included}} in the weaning diet of the pig to accelerate development of the large intestine. Inclusion of a non-fermentable, viscous compound, sodium carboxymethylcellulose (CMC), in a low-fibre weaning diet was tested to assess the influence of digesta viscosity on the gut in the absence of increased fermentation. Two CMC sources, of low and high viscosity, were added to cooked rice-based diet at 40 g/kg total diet. A third control rice diet did not contain any CMC. Diets were fed for 13 d following weaning at 3 weeks of age. Addition of CMC to the diet significantly increased the intestinal viscosity of digesta within the small (P< 0. 001) and large (P< 0. 05) intestine. No simple association was found between increases in intestinal viscosity and effects on intestinal morphology and whole-body growth. The average empty-body-weight gain and the small intestinal villus height increased with low-viscosity CMC, but decreased with the high-viscosity CMC group. The full large intestinal weight increased in all pigs fed CMC. Dietary CMC (both low- and high-viscosity) increased the percentage moisture of digesta and faeces, and was associated with increased faecal shedding of <b>enterotoxigenic</b> haemolytic <b>Escherichia</b> <b>coli.</b> Feed ingredients in weaning diets that excessively increase the viscosity of the intestinal digesta may be detrimental to pig health and production...|$|R
