5|$|Another {{distinctive}} feature of Aravan's iconography <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> demonic canine teeth. Although the central Koovagam icon does not feature such demonic teeth, {{they are a}} regular feature of most Draupadi cult images, where Aravan's demonic features are emphasized.|$|E
30|$|All {{kinds of}} {{persistent}} carotid-basilar anastomosis {{were present in}} our series. <b>The</b> most common <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> fetal pCom (23  %). From the other studied anatomic variants, <b>the</b> most common <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a hypoplastic A 1 segment. In all cases CTA was an excellent diagnostic tool, providing not only high-resolution angiographic images, but also details of the surrounding structures.|$|R

5|$|A {{more mundane}} example <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> astrological symbols found on some shoes and sandals from the Roman Empire. The use of shoes and sandals is well known, but Carol van Driel-Murray has {{proposed}} that astrological symbols etched onto sandals gave the footwear spiritual or medicinal meanings. This is supported through citation of other known uses of astrological symbols and their connection to medical practice {{and with the}} historical records of the time.|$|E
5|$|Cerebral venous sinus {{thrombosis}} (CVST) <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> acute thrombosis (a blood clot) in the dural venous sinuses, which drain {{blood from}} the brain. Symptoms may include headache, abnormal vision, any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness of the face and limbs {{on one side of}} the body, and seizures. The diagnosis is usually by computed tomography (CT/CAT scan) or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) employing radiocontrast to demonstrate obstruction of the venous sinuses by thrombus.|$|E
50|$|The main {{distinguishing}} characteristics from H. lanatus <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> rhizomes, and <b>the</b> bearded nodes or 'hairy knees' on the culm.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> creek's {{watershed}} <b>is</b> acidic. One {{contributing factor}} to this may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> acidic bogs. It is a freestone stream.|$|R
30|$|However, {{the surface}} layer of <b>the</b> SEM images <b>were</b> still {{observed}} bright and luminous, that indicate may <b>be</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> mineral species.|$|R
5|$|It {{may be that}} Óengus was {{involved}} in wars in Ireland, perhaps fighting with Áed Allán, or against him as an ally of Cathal mac Finguine. The evidence for such involvement is limited. There <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Óengus's son Bridei at Tory Island, on the north-west coast of Donegal in 733, close to the lands of Áed Allán's enemy Flaithbertach mac Loingsig. Less certainly, the Fragmentary Annals of Ireland report {{the presence of a}} Pictish fleet from Fortriu fighting for Flaithbertach in 733 rather than against him.|$|E
5|$|Most {{men have}} a normal sperm count, but a high {{proportion}} of sperm are abnormal; they are less motile and do not survive as well. The reason for these abnormalities is not known, but research points to dysfunction of the seminal vesicles and prostate, which concentrate substances that are toxic to sperm. Cytokines, immune proteins which promote an inflammatory response, are present at higher concentrations in semen of men with SCI, as is platelet-activating factor acetylhydrolase; both are harmful to sperm. Another immune-related response to SCI <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a higher number of white blood cells in the semen.|$|E
5|$|Phoenix and the {{surrounding}} areas are also home {{to a wide variety}} of native invertebrates including the Arizona bark scorpion, giant desert hairy scorpion, Arizona blond tarantula, Sonoran Desert centipede, tarantula hawk wasp, camel spider, and tailless whip scorpion. Of great concern <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Africanized bees which can be extremely dangerous—even lethal—when provoked.|$|E
50|$|There {{has also}} <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Bollywood personalities like Mahima Choudhary, Riteish Deshmukh {{and a host}} of Marathi film and TV personalities.|$|R
30|$|Typical {{clinical}} features of primary effusion lymphoma <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> pleural effusion {{and the absence}} of lymphadenopathy, and liver or spleen enlargement [34].|$|R

5|$|Plants have {{elaborate}} and effective defence mechanisms against viruses. One {{of the most}} effective <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> so-called resistance (R) genes. Each R gene confers resistance to a particular virus by triggering localised areas of cell death around the infected cell, which can often be seen with the unaided eye as large spots. This stops the infection from spreading. RNA interference is also an effective defence in plants. When they are infected, plants often produce natural disinfectants that kill viruses, such as salicylic acid, nitric oxide, and reactive oxygen molecules.|$|E
5|$|Ryholt dates Sheshi's reign to the mid 18th century BC. His main {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> seals of Sheshi and of two {{kings of}} the mid 13th Dynasty Sekhemrekhutawy Khabaw and Djedkheperew in the Egyptian fort of Uronarti in Nubia. The fort of Uronarti was abandoned {{at some point in}} the 13th Dynasty, an event which Ryholt dates to the reign of Djedkheperew given the lack of seals attributable to subsequent kings. Ryholt thus proposes that Sheshi reigned from c. 1745 BC until 1705 BC and was a contemporary of Khabaw and Djedkheperew.|$|E
5|$|Surrounded by hills, Lam Tin {{does not}} have {{direct access to the}} Victoria Harbour. However, {{merchant}} ships and ferries dock at Kwun Tong Pier and Lei Yue Mun Pier, which are both within 15 minutes' walk from Lam Tin, and provide surface transport for Lam Tin residents. Another reason for Lam Tin's absence of an outlet to the Harbour <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> an Eastern Harbour Crossing entrance inside the district, whose buses and MTR overtook ferries for cross-harbour transport.|$|E
40|$|Cytochrome P(450) {{oxidoreductase}} (POR) deficiency is {{a recently}} discovered new variant of congenital adrenal hyperplasia.

40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: Lhermitte's sign, a {{classical}} neurological sign, {{is a rare}} manifestation of vitamin B 12 deficiency. <b>The</b> aim here <b>was</b> to report on a case of an elderly patient with vitamin B 12 deficiency whose first clinical manifestation <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Lhermitte's sign. CASE REPORT: We describe an elderly patient with vitamin B 12 deficiency who presented cognitive dysfunction, peripheral polyneuropathy and sensory ataxia, and whose first clinical manifestation <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Lhermitte's sign. This sign <b>is</b> one of <b>the</b> rarest manifestations of vitamin B 12 deficiency...|$|R
50|$|Another reason has <b>been</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> {{a growing}} Number of Sufi Orders and Groups. Amongst these <b>is</b> <b>the</b> Murabitun, {{a group that}} has a strong {{following}} in Spain.|$|R
5|$|The {{commercial}} energy supplier for {{electricity and gas}} is at the consumer's choice. Southern Electric runs the local electricity distribution network, while SGN runs the gas distribution network. A notable part of the local energy infrastructure <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a 2 megawatt (peak) Enercon wind turbine at Green Park Business Park, wired to the local sub-grid. It {{has the potential to}} produce 3.5million units of electricity a year, enough to power over a thousand homes.|$|E
5|$|The ulnar styloid process (a {{projection}} on the ulna, one of {{the bones}} of the forearm, where it meets the wrist) is not as hooked as in other lorisids, according to Schwartz, which Groves suggests may indicate that the wrist is more mobile. Another alleged diagnostic feature <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> an entepicondylar foramen (an opening near the distal, or far, end of the bone) on the humerus (upper arm bone); however, Sarmiento found this feature in 4 out of 11 specimens, and on one side of a fifth, and Stump noted that the foramen occurred in specimens from across the potto's range.|$|E
5|$|The {{whole of}} Scotland was {{subjected}} to glaciation during the Pleistocene epoch. A sign of this on Lismore <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> rock-cut platforms close to the seashore that indicate the changing sea-levels; {{in some areas of}} the northern coast they also betray the presence of ice by the striation marks on the rocks.|$|E
50|$|Other {{distinguishing}} features that differentiate Mallomonas cells from Synura cells <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> bristles and V-shaped ridges on their scales. Pore-collar complexes on stomatocysts are species differentiating features.|$|R
2500|$|The {{concluding}} tenth chapter, [...] "Hindu Unity and the Non-Hindu Other", {{discusses the}} timing of the unification of Hindu philosophical schools, suggesting that <b>the</b> stimulus <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Islam.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} {{criterion for}} inclusion in this genus <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> small schizonts giving rise to 8 or less merozoites. <b>The</b> criteria <b>were</b> subsequently revised by Telford in 1988.|$|R
5|$|A {{prerequisite}} for natural selection {{to result in}} adaptive evolution, novel traits and speciation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> heritable genetic variation that results in fitness differences. Genetic variation {{is the result of}} mutations, genetic recombinations and alterations in the karyotype (the number, shape, size and internal arrangement of the chromosomes). Any of these changes might have an effect that is highly advantageous or highly disadvantageous, but large effects are rare. In the past, most changes in the genetic material were considered neutral or close to neutral because they occurred in noncoding DNA or resulted in a synonymous substitution. However, many mutations in non-coding DNA have deleterious effects. Although both mutation rates and average fitness effects of mutations are dependent on the organism, a majority of mutations in humans are slightly deleterious.|$|E
5|$|Another factor {{pointing}} to Deva Victrix as a provincial capital <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a port. From Deva, Ireland (Hibernia) was also accessible, a land which Agricola {{had plans to}} conquer; he even launched an expedition to Ireland, though where from is unclear. Also, the Flavian dynasty was expansionist, and Deva was closer to what would then have been the front, making administration quicker and easier. Furthermore, historian Vittorio Di Martino believes that Agricola could have chosen Deva Victrix as a possible future capital of Roman Britain because it was practically placed at {{the centre of the}} British isles, being located geographically at nearly the same distance from the westernmost shores of Ireland, the easternmost lands of Britannia and the Channel.|$|E
5|$|At Horseshoe Bend, Shirehampton {{the wooded}} cliff and a narrow salt marsh are {{supported}} by rocks of Devonian sandstone and Carboniferous limestone, overlain by with Triassic Dolomitic conglomerate. The site's principal interest {{and the reason for}} its designation as an SSSI <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> a population of the True Service-tree (Sorbus domestica) growing on the cliffs. This tree is nationally rare in Britain, and this site hosts the largest known population in England. Other notable species of Sorbus here are the whitebeams Sorbus eminens and Sorbus anglica, both of which are also nationally rare in Britain. The nationally scarce Large-leaved Lime (Tilia platyphyllos) also occurs, and herbs include Field garlic (Allium oleraceum) and Pale St. John's-wort (Hypericum montanum). The saltmarsh vegetation, which lies {{at the base of the}} cliff, is predominantly made up of Sea Aster (Aster tripolium) and English Scurvygrass (Cochlearia anglica). There are however two nationally scarce vascular plant species here as well– Slender Hare's-ear (Bupleurum tenuissimum) and Long-stalked Orache (Atriplex longipes).|$|E
50|$|The main {{features}} that distinguish a myeloblast from a lymphoblast upon microscopic examination <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> more prominent nucleoli, the nuclear chromatin being less condensed, and cytoplasmic granules are present.|$|R
5000|$|Additional notable {{features}} <b>of</b> <b>the</b> site <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{large heath}} butterfly (Coenonympha tullia), the upland bird population, and stands of bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) with chickweed wintergreen (Trientalis europaea).|$|R
25|$|One of Haury's passions {{that lasted}} {{throughout}} his career <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>presence</b> <b>of</b> Paleoindians in <b>the</b> Southwest. He conducted several excavations at Paleoindian sites and subsequently wrote several papers on the subject.|$|R
