25|$|<b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> wine (or Friuli wine) is wine made in {{the northeastern}} Italian region of <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia.</b> Once part of the Venetian Republic and with {{sections}} {{under the influence of}} the Austro-Hungarian Empire for some time, the wines of the region have noticeable Slavic and Germanic influences. There are 11 Denominazione di origine controllata (DOC) and 3 Denominazione di Origine Controllata e Garantita (DOCG) in the <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> area. The region has 3 Indicazione Geografica Tipica (IGT) designations Alto Livenza, delle Venezie and Venezia Giulia. Nearly 62% of the wine produced in the region falls under a DOC designation. The area is known predominantly for its white wines which are considered some of the best examples of Italian wine in that style. Along with the Veneto and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, the <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> forms the Tre Venezie wine region which ranks with Tuscany and Piedmont as Italy's world class wine regions.|$|E

25|$|Malvasia {{wines are}} {{produced}} in Italy (including <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia,</b> Lombardia, Apulia, Sicily, Lipari, Emilia-Romagna, and Sardinia), Slovenia, Croatia (including Istria), Corsica, the Iberian Peninsula, the Canary Islands, {{the island of}} Madeira, California, Arizona, New Mexico, Australia and Brazil. These grapes are used to produce white (and more rarely red) table wines, dessert wines, and fortified wines of the same name, or are sometimes used {{as part of a}} blend of grapes, such as in Vin Santo.|$|E
25|$|The bulk {{of today}} Italy was {{inhabited}} by Italic tribes who occupied the modern regions of Lazio, Umbria, Marche, Abruzzo, Molise, Campania, Basilicata, Calabria, Apulia and Sicily. Sicily, {{in addition to}} having an Italic population in the Sicels, also was inhabited by the Sicani and the Elymians, of uncertain origin. The Veneti, most often regarded as an Italic tribe, chiefly inhabited the Veneto, but extended as far east as <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> and Istria, and had colonies as far south as Lazio.|$|E
25|$|Similarly Sancerre is {{compared}} to Sauvignon blancs produced around the globe. According to Master of wine Mary Ewing-Mulligan, Sancerre tends to be less herbaceous and grassy than Sauvignon blancs from New Zealand and the Alto-Adige and <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> region of Italy. Compared to Sauvignon blanc grown in Bordeaux, which are often blended with Semillon, Sancerre can be both more concentrated with more racy acidity. When contrasted with New World examples from California, Washington, Chile and South Africa, Sancerre tends to exhibit more assertive mineral flavours.|$|E
25|$|The best {{vineyards}} in the <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> {{are located}} on the south facing slopes of the Alps foothills {{in the southern part}} of the region where they can benefit from the most direct sunlight to go along with the night-time cool breezes from the Adriatic. The vineyard yields of the Friuli are among the lowest in Italy averaging 3.5 tons an acre. This is a result of the Friuli quest for high quality over quantity in their wines and also a reason why these wines tend to be more costly than other Italian whites.|$|E
25|$|After the 1976 {{reform the}} IV Alpine Army Corps was {{responsible}} {{to defend the}} Italian border along the main chain of the alps from the Swiss-Austrian-Italian border tripoint {{in the west to}} the Italian-Yugoslavian border in the east. In case of war with Yugoslavia the IV Alpine Army Corps would remain static in its position guarding the left flank of the Italian V Corps, which would meet the enemy forces in the plains of <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia.</b> The only brigade which would have seen combat in such a case would have been the Julia.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{phylloxera}} epidemic, winemaking in the Friuli {{region was}} very muted {{and did not}} begin to garner much attention till the 1970s. The international popularity of Pinot grigio in the 1980s and 1990s help to change the dynamic of <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> winemaking. Prior to this time vineyard owners sold their grapes in bulk to co-ops and négociant-like wineries that would blend the grapes together. With the success of Mario Schiopetto in bottling and marketing the product of his own vineyard, other vineyard owners followed suit and began opening up small wineries of their own.|$|E
25|$|The {{winemaking}} {{history of}} the <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> has been strongly influenced by the {{history of the}} Friuli and Venezia Giulia regions that were important stops along the Mediterranean spice route from the Byzantine Empire to the trading center of Venice. During the Middle Ages, travelers passing through this area brought grapevines from Macedonia and Anatolia. Under the Habsburg reign, the French grape varieties were introduced. Prior to the phylloxera epidemic over 350 grape varieties were grown in the region. During the 19th century, the region served as a major Mediterranean port for the Austro-Hungarian Empire which bought a Teutonic influence to the area.|$|E
25|$|Beginnings of naturism in Slovenia {{started in}} the year 1852, when a 29 year old Swiss {{physician}} Arnold Rikli visited Bled for the first time. In the following years he started to promote healthy way of living, because he considered water, air and light {{to be the source}} for his healing therapy. He continued to build spa centers which included light therapy and hydrotherapy treatment. His first visitors were most likely pilgrims from Slovenia and <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> region who visited the church on Bled island. When the word has spreaded across Europe, other visitors started visiting Bled known for Rikli's healing therapy. A method used in the healing therapy process included sunbathing and visitors were often seen walking nude in public. Rikli continued to promote his healing tourism for the next 52 years, when he lived in Bled.|$|E
25|$|The Isonzo and Carso wine {{regions are}} located in the far southeastern part of <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> {{bordering}} Slovenia. The Isonzo region is located on a plain of alluvial deposits directly south of Collio along the Isonzo river. The best vineyards {{are located in}} the northeast, close to Cormons. The wine regions predominately have a maritime climate with more rainfall than other Friuli regions. The region is known for its sparkling Pinot bianco as well as dry white wines made from Chardonnay, Malvasia Istriana and Sauvignon blanc. Other Isonzo DOC designated wines include dry, off dry and sparkling wines made from Gewürztraminer, Cabernet franc, Cabernet Sauvignon, Franconia, Moscato Giallo, Moscato Rosa, Pinot grigio, Pinot nero, Refosco, Riesling, Schioppettino, Friulano, Verduzzo and Welschriesling. The Vendemmia Tardiva is a late harvest wine made from a varietal style or blend of Chardonnay, Pinot biano, Friulano and Verduzzo.|$|E
25|$|The <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> {{region is}} bordered by the Alps {{to the north}} {{separating}} it from Austria. Slovenia borders the region on {{the east and the}} Italian region of Veneto forms the western border and part of the southern border with the Adriatic Sea. The northern half is very mountainous and gives way to flatter terrain and plains {{on the way to the}} sea. The climate is distinguished with very warm days and chilly nights that help maintain a balance in the grape between acidity and sugar levels and allows the grapes a long, slow growing season. In summertime the mean temperature is around 73°F (22.8°C) with rainfall averaging 60inches (1,530mm). Harvest normally takes place in September. The soils of the region vary from the calcium rich marl and flysch sandstone in the more hilly regions to clay, sand and gravel in the valley. The names of Friuli vineyards and wine estates often include the word ronco (plural ronchi), which is the Friulian word for a terraced hillside.|$|E
25|$|Though many varietal {{forms of}} Chardonnay are produced, {{and the numbers}} are increasing, {{for most of its}} history in Italian {{winemaking}} Chardonnay was a blending grape. Besides Pinot bianco, Chardonnay can be found in blends with Albana, Catarratto, Cortese, Erbaluce, Favorita, Garganega, Grecanico, Incrocio Manzoni, Nuragus, Procanico, Ribolla Gialla, Verdeca, Vermentino and Viognier. It even blended into a dry White Zinfandel-style Nebbiolo wine that is made from the white juice of the red Nebbiolo grape prior to being dyed with skin contact. Most Chardonnay plantings are located in the northern wine regions, though plantings can be found throughout Italy as far south as Sicily and Apulia. In Piedmont and Tuscany, the grape is being planted in sites that are less favorable to Dolcetto and Sangiovese respectively. In Lombardy, the grape is often used for spumante and in the Veneto it is often blended with Garganega to give more weight and structure to the wine. Chardonnay is also found in the Valle d'Aosta DOC and <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> wine region.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{settlers}} were from northern Italy, {{particularly from the}} <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> region. Part of the population included Slovenians who were escaping from persecution in Fascist Italy, as well as Poles and Czechoslovaks who were admitted after Italy introduced a new policy that restricted their immigration to Italy from Poland and Czechoslovakia, respectively. The inhabitants initially paid a 10% deposit of {{the total value of}} the land they received, which was delivered fenced and ploughed. The extensions included a house with a porch, bathroom and well. The houses built on the 10 and 15 hectare extensions came with four bedrooms, while the ones built on the 5 hectare lots had two. The development plan of the Colonization Company encouraged crop diversification and promoted the cultivation of alfalfa, vineyards, pear trees, and apple trees. In 1925, {{the settlers}} worked every Sunday for a month to build a 1.5km (.93mi) path; they later built a church and a graveyard at the end of it. The next year, the train station of Villa Regina was inaugurated.|$|E
25|$|Most of the {{vineyards}} of the <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> {{are located in}} the southern half of the region, including the large wine regions of Collio Goriziano, Colli Orientali del Friuli, Isonzo and Carso. The Lison-Pramaggiore region is shared with the Veneto. Smaller regions such as the Annia, Aquileia, Grave and Latisana {{are located in the}} central and western part of the region around the city of Pordenone. These smaller regions are located on alluvial plains with soils composed of gravel and sand. The wines made here are lighter and less elegant than the Friuli wines made in the major southern wine regions. Unlike other Friuli regions which require 100%, a varietal wine in the Graves and Aquileia zones only need 85% of the grape variety with the Latisana and Annia zones requiring 90%. More red wine is produced in these zones than {{in the rest of the}} Friuli with Merlot, Cabernet franc and Cabernet Sauvignon being the leading varietals. With wine production still, frizzante and spumante styles are produced from Chardonnay, Pinot bianco, Pinot grigio, Friulano and Verduzzo.|$|E
25|$|Over 30 {{different}} grapes {{varieties are}} {{grown in the}} <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> including international varieties such as Chardonnay, Cabernet Sauvignon and Merlot {{as well as local}} varieties like Refosco dal peduncolo rosso, Schioppettino, Friulano, Ribolla gialla and Verduzzo. Of the local varieties, Friulano is the most well known and important variety, producing crisp, floral wines that develop notes of nuts and fennel as it ages. The grape was widely known as Tocai Friulano but in 2006 the European Union banned names that have some similarity or association with the Hungarian wine Tokaji. Now Tocai Friulano is called Friulano. The very acidic Ribolla gialla grape was primarily used as a blending component until winemakers started to apply the techniques used with Chardonnay (such as malolactic fermentation) to produce softer, more buttery wines that still retain the crisp, lemon edge of the grape. Wines made from Verduzzo have peach and nutty flavors in their youth but develop more honeyed flavors as the wine ages. The high acidity of the grape works well in sweet production and in regions like Ramandolo it is often dried to make a passito wine. The Picolit grape also does well in sweet wines where it can produce elegant, floral wines that have a dry finish. In contrast to the thin, sometimes bland Pinot grigio produced {{in other parts of the}} Tre-Venezie, well made examples of Friuli Pinot grigio are known for their fuller body and delicate peach, almond and green apple flavors. Sauvignon blancs are made in a style reminiscent of Sancerre with smoke, herbs and elements of honey and hazelnut. Some of the most expensive Friuli wines are made from the Picolit grape which is prone to grape diseases and mutations which cause the vine to lose its flowers and grape clusters. In most years, less than half of a vineyard Picolit crop will survive and be able to make wine. The light, honeyed dessert wine that it can produce is often in high demand because of restricted supply.|$|E

500|$|In the Piedmontese {{valleys and}} some Ligurian {{communities}} of northwestern Italy, the music preserves the strong influence of ancient Occitania. The lyrics of the Occitanic troubadours {{are some of}} the oldest preserved samples of vernacular song, and modern bands like Gai Saber and Lou Dalfin preserve and contemporize Occitan music. The Occitanian culture retains characteristics of the ancient Celtic influence, through the use of six- or seven-hole flutes (fifre) or the bagpipes (piva). The music of <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia,</b> in northeastern Italy, shares much more in common with Austria and Slovenia including variants of the waltz and the polka. Much of northern Italy shares with areas of Europe further to the north an interest in ballad singing (called canto epico lirico in Italian) and choral singing. Even balladsusually thought of as a vehicle for a solo voicemay be sung in choirs. In the province of Trento [...] "folk choirs" [...] are {{the most common form of}} music making.|$|E
500|$|In Piedmont, {{the grape}} was {{sometimes}} {{used as an}} [...] "illegal" [...] blending partner with Nebbiolo for DOC classified Barolo {{with the intention of}} adding color and more fruit flavors. In the DOCs of Langhe and Monferrato, Cabernet is a permitted blending grape with Nebbiolo as well as Barbera. Wines that are composed of all three grape varieties are often subjected to considerable oak treatment to add a sense of sweet spiciness to compensate for the high tannins of Cabernet Sauvignon and Nebbiolo as well as the high acidity of Barbera. There are varietal styles of Cabernet Sauvignon produce in Piedmont with qualities varying depending on the location. In other regions of northern Italy, such as Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna and <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia,</b> the grape is often blended with Merlot to produce Bordeaux style blends. In the Veneto region, Cabernet Sauvignon is sometimes blended with the main grapes of Valpolicella-Corvina, Molinara and Rondinella. In southern Italy, the grape is mostly used as a blending component with local varieties-such as Carignan in Sardinia, Nero d'Avola in Sicily, Aglianico in Campania and Gaglioppo in Calabria.|$|E
500|$|A similar {{situation}} occurred in Italy when, in 1990, the Ca' del Bosco Winery acquired {{what they thought}} was Cabernet Franc vines from a French nursery. The growers noticed that the grapes were different from the traditional Cabernet Franc both in color and taste. They also noticed that the vines ripened earlier than Cabernet Franc would have. Other Italian wine regions also started to doubt the origin of these vines and it was finally established to be Carménère. Although, in Italy, the variety is grown mainly in the northeast part of the country from Brescia to Friuli, it has only recently been entered into Italy's national catalog of vine varieties and thus [...] "no district has yet requested the authorization to use it". Therefore, the wine [...] "cannot be cultivated with its original name or specific vintage and the name cannot be used to identify the wine on the label with an IGT, DOC or a DOCG status assignment." [...] Ca' del Bosco Winery names the wine it produces Carmenero. In 2007 the grape was authorised to be used in Italian DOC wines from Veneto (Arcole, Bagnoli di Sopra, Cori Benedettine del Padovano, Garda, Merlara, Monti Lessini, Riviera del Brenta and Vicenza), <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> (Collio, or Collio Goriziano) and Sardinia (Alghero). Since a ministerial decree of 2009, producers of Piave DOC wines in 50 communes of the Province of Treviso, and 12 in the Province of Venice have been permitted where appropriate to specify the variety Carmenère on the wine label.|$|E
500|$|The Adriatic Sea is a semi-enclosed sea, bordered in the {{southwest}} by the Apennine or Italian Peninsula, in the northwest by the Italian regions of Veneto and <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia,</b> and in the northeast by Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Albania—the Balkan peninsula. In the southeast, the Adriatic Sea connects to the Ionian Sea at the [...] wide Strait of Otranto. The International Hydrographic Organization (IHO) defines {{the boundary between the}} Adriatic and the Ionian seas as a line running from the Butrinto River's mouth (latitude 39°44'N) in Albania to the Karagol Cape in Corfu, through this island to the Kephali Cape (these two capes are in latitude 39°45'N), and on to the Santa Maria di Leuca Cape (latitude 39°48'N).

The drainage basin's mean elevation is [...] above sea level, with a mean slope of 12.1°. Major rivers discharging into the Adriatic include the Po, Soča, Krka, Neretva, Drin, Bojana, and Vjosë. In the late 19th century, Austria-Hungary established a geodetic network with an elevation benchmark using the average Adriatic Sea level at the Sartorio pier in Trieste, Italy. The benchmark was subsequently retained by Austria, adopted by Yugoslavia, and retained by the states that emerged after its dissolution. In 2016, Slovenia adopted a new elevation benchmark referring to the upgraded tide gauge station in the coastal town of Koper.|$|E
2500|$|Wine expert Oz Clarke {{notes that}} one of the reasons why Mondeuse noire was often {{associated}} with the <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> wine grape Refosco dal Peduncolo Rosso was likely due to [...] "Italianate intensity" [...] of the wines produced from the grape with their bitter cherry notes and dark plum fruit.|$|E
2500|$|Italian {{nationalism}} {{has also}} faced opposition from within Italy. Regionalism and municipal identities have challenged a unified Italian identity, {{such as those}} in <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia,</b> Naples, Sardinia, Sicily and Veneto. Such regional identities evoked strong opposition after the Piedmontese-led unification of Italy to plans for [...] "Piedmontization" [...] of Italy. Italian identity has long been strained by a larger regional North-South divide that developed partly from the economic differences of a highly industrialized North and a highly agricultural South.|$|E
2500|$|In Italy this wine {{is grown}} in the <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> region in Collio DOC and Isonzo DOC. The name comes from the Istria {{peninsula}} spanning over Croatia, Slovenia and Italy (see also Croatian and Slovene varieties). The vine {{was introduced to the}} area by Venetian merchants who brought cuttings from Greece. Malvasia Istriana is also found in the Colli Piacentini region of Emilia where it is used to make sparkling wine known locally as champagnino or [...] "little Champagne".|$|E
2500|$|Today, Italian rosés {{are most}} often made by the short {{maceration}} method though some regions do have a tradition of blending red and white wine grapes {{together to make a}} lightly colored wine. According to wine expert Oz Clarke, northeast Italy (which includes the Veneto wine, <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> and Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol (wine), tends to make [...] "delicate rosés" [...] while warmer southern Italy (which includes Calabria, Apulia and Sicily) makes fuller bodied and [...] "fairly gutsy dry rosés".|$|E
2500|$|Further {{west in the}} Italian {{regions of}} Lombardy, Emilia-Romagna, and Piedmont, it is called [...] "barbaforte (strong beard)" [...] and is a {{traditional}} accompaniment to bollito misto; while in north-eastern regions like Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol, Veneto and <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia,</b> it is still called [...] "kren" [...] or [...] "cren". In the southern region of Basilicata it is known as [...] "rafano" [...] and used for {{the preparation of the}} so-called [...] "rafanata", a main course made of horseradish, eggs, cheese and sausage.|$|E
2500|$|Up {{until the}} 1980s, when the wines of the <b>Friuli-Venezia</b> <b>Giulia</b> began to receive notice, the white wines of the Gavi region were {{touted as the}} best {{expression}} of dry Italian wine.
