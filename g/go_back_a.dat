Darwin took in the sights of the city then made an expedition into the interior, returning to the ship on 24 April. By then Robert McCormick had left the ship, with permission from the admiral in command, and returned to England. Assistant Surgeon Benjamin Bynoe was made acting surgeon in his place. McCormick felt [...] "very much disappointed in my expectations of carrying out my natural history pursuits, every obstacle having been placed {{in the way of}} my getting on shore and making collections" [...] while the gentleman Darwin received all the invitations from dignitaries onshore and was given facilities to pack his collections. On 26 April Darwin moved into a house he had rented at Botafogo, and stayed there with three others when the Beagle left on 10 May to recheck observations at Bahia. FitzRoy had found a discrepancy of [...] in the meridian distance of longitude between his measurements and those of Albin Roussin, and decided to <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> <b>A</b> seaman, a ship's boy and a young midshipman had caught a fever after visiting the Macacu River, and died. When the ship returned to Rio on 3 June, FitzRoy confirmed that his measurements of Bahia and of the Abrolhos reefs were correct, and sent these corrections to Roussin. They sailed from Rio on 5 July.|$|E

In November, the band received the [...] "Innovator Award" [...] at the 2010 Classic Rock Roll of Honour; the award was presented to Killing Joke by Jimmy Page of Led Zeppelin, who stated, [...] "I <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>a</b> long way with Jaz Coleman and the band. I used {{to go and see}} the band, and it was a band that really impressed me because Geordie's guitar sound was just really, really strong. And they were really tribal, the band, and it was really intense. It was just really good to hear something like that during the 80s, which sort of caved in a bit with haircuts and synthesizers". The band were also honoured by [...] Metal Hammer at their annual awards, receiving the Album of the Year award for Absolute Dissent.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the episode}} of The Daily Show that night, Stewart jokingly responded with {{an apology for}} taking Cramer's {{comments}} out of context. [...] "OK, I was wrong. So Jim Cramer, I apologize," [...] Stewart said. [...] He then promptly showcased video of Cramer suggesting the safety of Bear Stearns stock during the Lightning Round on Mad Money, eleven days prior {{to the collapse of}} Bear Stearns. Stewart then stated, [...] "He's not saying literally 'I'm asking you to buy Bear Stearns'; for that you have to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>a</b> full seven weeks before the stock completely collapsed." [...] Stewart then showed additional video footage of Cramer on January 24, 2008 telling TheStreet.com TV viewers to specifically [...] "buy Bear Stearns" [...] stock seven weeks before it collapsed. [...] A clip showed Cramer's stating that he liked the stock at prices above $60, and later on February 5, 2008, Cramer changed Bear Stearns' rating to a Sell on TheStreet.com.|$|E

2500|$|Later on, ElBaradei {{arrived in}} Tahrir Square to join {{thousands}} of other protesters against the Mubarak regime and spoke directly to the people, stating that they [...] "have taken back [...] rights" [...] and that they cannot <b>go</b> <b>back.</b> <b>A</b> number of Egyptian political movements have called on ElBaradei to form a transitional government.

2500|$|Zsa Zsa {{arrives in}} the show's setting of Albert Square, jumping the {{barriers}} at the tube station. She sees Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty) selling T-shirts and makes up a story about her boyfriend dying {{in a car crash}} in order to distract Whitney so she can shoplift.

2500|$|Songs to Remember {{received}} a favourable reception from the UK music press on its release. Melody Maker stated that [...] "Green's determination to stamp his brandmark into the nation's consciousness is {{reflected by the}} album's pompous title... Yet {{the funny thing is}} those dubious proclamations just aren't needed because the arrogance embodied in the title is emphatically based on vinyl reality... Some people may find Green's sugary vocals and Adam Kidron's lush production just a little too refined; listening to Scritti can be a bit like having honey tipped down your ears, but that seems like a perfect design for mainstream invasion. If justice prevailed Songs to Remember would be number one across the globe... You'd have to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>a</b> long way to find a better pop record than this – back to the Sixties probably." [...] NME noted that six of the album's nine tracks had already appeared in some form on the singles, and wryly described Songs to Remember as [...] "Scritti Politti's greatest hits... It's by no means a disturbing record to listen to, which is why it could appeal to the timid, but Green's lyrical preoccupations – language, definitions, the way one's preconceptions determine and control perception – would intrigue the curious... Songs to Remember is witty, ingenious, likeable and probably in the public interest." [...] Smash Hits felt that [...] "the two years it took to make may have blunted its impact somewhat" [...] but [...] "there's more than enough in Songs to Remember to establish Scritti Politti as the acceptable face of intellectual pop." ...|$|E
