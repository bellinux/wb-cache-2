During the trial, the prosecuting attorney and a gun expert staged a mock struggle with a blank <b>filled</b> <b>gun,</b> in which the gun accidentally discharged.|$|R

50|$|After the {{dissolution}} of coast artillery in the United Kingdom in 1956 the battery was disarmed and disposed of by the War Office. Many parts of the battery were demolished and <b>gun</b> positions <b>filled</b> in. Some <b>gun</b> emplacements still remain.|$|R
5|$|Wyatt {{said that}} he saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury in Spangenberger's gun and {{hardware}} store on 4th Street <b>filling</b> their <b>gun</b> belts with cartridges. Ike testified afterward that Tom was not there {{and that he had}} tried to buy a new revolver but the owner saw Ike's bandaged head and refused to sell him one. Ike apparently had not heard Virgil tell him that his confiscated weapons were at the Grand Hotel around the corner from Spangenberger's shop.|$|R
60|$|Again the Tank {{is like a}} slug. The slug, {{as every}} {{biological}} student knows, is unexpectedly complicated inside. The Tank is as crowded with inward parts as a battleship. It is <b>filled</b> with engines, <b>guns</b> and ammunition, and in the interstices men.|$|R
50|$|Red is {{appointed}} town marshal {{and attempts}} {{to get to the}} bottom of a scheme. Little Beaver is kidnapped by Jackson, but by pretending to be shot with a <b>gun</b> <b>filled</b> with blanks, Red is able to surprise the killers and thieves and restore order to Bitter Springs.|$|R
50|$|Using the {{information}} extracted from Stepan, Sergei and Simon drive to Koron's apartment, but find that Baklazhan {{is the only}} person there. Koron had left earlier to try to find Stepan, while Bala stepped out to buy some cigarettes. Sergei and Simon overpower and tie up Baklazhan.

5000|$|Unable to {{understand}} why the Indians keep staging raids against these same wagons, Laish and scout Crowshaw distract them with cases of liquor. They also anger Tillotson, a trader, by using his large wagon as bait. Christella is impressed by Laish's bravery, then accidentally learns of his true identity. Crowshaw ends up shooting Tillotson, whose wagons are <b>filled</b> with <b>guns</b> and ammunition that the Indians have been after all along.

50|$|Ascher also finds, to everyone's surprise, that Margaret was Carlotta's birth mother, that Carlotta had {{tracked down}} Margaret and become Harrison's lover. It {{is not clear}} whether her birth father was Harrison or Reynolds. Carlotta had hoped to work her way into the Brent's lives, angry at her English {{upbringing}} by a sexually abusive adoptive father rather than by the wealthy Brents. When Margaret finds out that Carlotta was her daughter and that she will be arrested as an accessory to the murders of Mrs. Johaneston and McAuley, she tries to commit suicide, but Ascher has <b>filled</b> her <b>gun</b> with blanks.|$|R
50|$|Various {{witnesses}} offered conflicting {{testimony about}} whether Tom was armed. When the gunfight ended, a gun {{was not found}} near Tom McLaury or on his body. Wyatt Earp later insisted that someone had removed Tom's weapon and that the Cowboys lied during the O.K. Corral hearing. At the time, The Tombstone Epitaph was loyal to the business owners and the Earps, while the Tombstone Nugget favored rural interests and the Cowboys. Wyatt testified afterward that he saw Billy Clanton and Frank McLaury in Spangenberger's gun and hardware store on 4th Street <b>filling</b> their <b>gun</b> belts with cartridges.|$|R

50|$|As {{this process}} continued, the missile found itself {{being used for}} {{more and more of the}} roles {{formerly}} <b>filled</b> by <b>guns.</b> First to go were the large weapons, replaced by equally large missile systems of much higher performance. Smaller missiles soon followed, eventually becoming small enough to be mounted on armoured cars and tank chassis. These started replacing, or at least supplanting, similar gun-based SPAAG systems in the 1960s, and by the 1990s had replaced almost all such systems in modern armies. Man-portable missiles, MANPADs as they are known today, were introduced in the 1960s and have supplanted or even replaced even the smallest guns in most advanced armies.|$|R
5000|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Halsey with Sing J Lee, marking the singer's directorial debut. It was shot in Mexico City. Inspired by Baz Luhrmann's 1996 film Romeo + Juliet, the video is <b>filled</b> with <b>gun</b> violence. Halsey talked about the video's plot in a statement, saying: [...] "It is one part in the centre of a long narrative that {{tells the story of}} two people in love despite the forces trying to keep them apart. On its own, the song is about two impatient young lovers, but {{in the context of the}} Hopeless Fountain Kingdom universe, the stakes are much higher for these two star-crossed lovers".|$|R
50|$|The FK36(r) and Pak 36(r) {{both had}} a split-trail carriage, with a {{transverse}} leaf spring axle suspension, and steel wheels, with foam rubber <b>filled</b> tires. The <b>guns</b> were equipped with a semi-automatic vertical breech block; the recoil mechanism consisted of a hydraulic recoil buffer and a hydropneumatic recuperator. There was no limber; therefore the gun could not be towed by a horse team.|$|R
60|$|Then {{for a time}} {{everybody}} was busy with a gun. For three minutes lives were cheap at the Experimental Farm, and the banging of <b>guns</b> <b>filled</b> the air. Redwood, careless of Bensington in his excitement, rushed in pursuit, and was knocked headlong by a mass of brick fragments, mortar, plaster, and rotten lath splinters that came flying out at him as a bullet whacked through the wall.|$|R
50|$|Filling {{factories}} had a {{large number}} of buildings. Buildings were needed on the various Groups for filling of munitions. Explosives magazines were required by each Group to store the incoming explosive materials and to store the outgoing <b>filled</b> shells or <b>gun</b> cartridges, usually packed in ammunition boxes. Storage buildings were also needed on each Group to store the incoming empty shells and the empty ammunition boxes.|$|R
50|$|On {{board the}} U.S.S. Galena {{in the attack}} on Fort Darling at Drewry’s Bluff, James River, on May 15, 1862.

6000|$|... "Send out messengers," [...] I said, [...] "to Marais--he is at Botha's farm--and {{to all the}} neighbours. Send, {{for your}} lives; gather up the {{friendly}} Kaffirs and ride like hell for Maraisfontein. Don't talk to me, father; don't talk! Go and do what I tell you. Stay! Give me two <b>guns,</b> <b>fill</b> the saddle-bags with powder tins and loopers, and tie them to my mare. Oh! be quick, be quick!" ...|$|R
50|$|With {{the play}} {{effectively}} finished Edwards and Castle {{returned to the}} stage each night for an encore that often lasted {{for over an hour}} of jokes and routines, often 'attacking' the front stalls and private boxes with toy machine <b>guns</b> <b>filled</b> with table tennis balls. The audience in the expensive private boxes were usually the recipients of most of the more outrageous ribbing and leg-pulling during the show.|$|R
5000|$|The varmint <b>gun</b> <b>fills</b> {{a design}} {{gap between the}} more {{powerful}} big-game rifles and the less powerful rimfire firearms[...]22 Long Rifle (the most popular rimfire caliber) is somewhat underpowered for small predators, but is perfectly adequate to dealing with typical vermin; the term [...] "varmint" [...] covers larger animals which usually harass farms from the outside (as opposed to infestation by vermin), and the varmint gun assists in the control of them.|$|R
60|$|Their {{difficulties}} now began. The rivulets were deep, {{the ground}} treacherous; fascines {{had to be}} laid down, and the rivulets <b>filled</b> up, before <b>guns</b> could get over; and even when across they could but feebly answer the French artillery, which from the higher ground commanded their whole line; thus the allies lost 2000 men before Eugene got the army he commanded across the marshes. Then at half past twelve he sent word to Marlborough that he was ready.|$|R

The video was later projected over the ketchup splattered wall with only the artist visible accompanied by audio of the boys voices. It was described by Walter Robinson of Artnet as being “like Lord of the Flies, but without the protective distance of fiction. “ ...|$|R
50|$|The monster {{emerges from}} the water and is {{immediately}} shelled by the surrounding forces, but the assault doesn't stop Varan. Kenji drives a truck <b>filled</b> with Special <b>Gun</b> Powder to the runway of Haneda airport. The monster advances on the vehicle, and Kenji escapes to a safe distance. With Varan now directly ever the loaded truck, its detonation trigger is activated, causing the monster to be knocked flat. The military celebrates, prematurely, as Varan rises seemingly unfazed and begins another assault.|$|R

2500|$|The Airacuda {{was plagued}} with {{problems}} from the start. The lofty performance estimates were unobtainable as, despite its sleek looks, the Airacuda was heavy and was slower than most bombers. In {{the event of}} interception by enemy fighters, the Airacuda was not maneuverable enough to dogfight, while the meager [...] bombload was of little use in the intended fighter-bomber role.

30|$|A {{total of}} six {{inoculation}} sets were made, and are detailed in Table  1. To prepare for inoculation, logs were cut with a chainsaw to expose an area of sapwood approximately 5  cm wide {{down the length of}} the log. For inoculation, a sterilized 100  mL compressed air spray gun (Badger Mini Spray Gun, Badger Air-Brush Co., USA) was used to spray the semi-solid media onto the logs outside a laminar flow hood. Prior to <b>filling</b> the <b>gun,</b> the media was agitated by hand with a sterilized spatula for 35  s, during which time approximately 2  mL of distilled water was mixed into each jar. Exposed areas of the logs were sprayed until heavily coated with media. The entire contents of four jars were used to inoculate each set of six logs, with equal portions of liquid media on each log.|$|R

60|$|On a dark November morning, when a blustering wind {{drove the}} rain against the windows, Thomas Foster sat {{stripping}} the lock of a favorite {{gun in the}} room he called his study, at Hazlehurst, in Shropshire. The shelves on the handsome paneled walls contained a few works on agriculture, horse-breeding, and British natural history, but two racks were <b>filled</b> with <b>guns</b> and fishing-rods and the table at which Foster was seated had a vise clamped to its edge. He had once had a commodious gun-room, but had given it up, under pressure from his wife, as Hazlehurst was small and she had numerous guests, but the study was his private retreat. A hacksaw, a few files, a wire brush, {{and a bottle of}} Rangoon oil were spread out in front of him, the latter standing, for the sake of cleanliness, {{on the cover of the}} Field.|$|R
