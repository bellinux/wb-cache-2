5|$|But the {{identification}} of the poem as Stoic is not unanimous. In 1887, against the common opinion of scholars at the time, Gustave Lanson contested the idea that the poem is Stoic. More recently, in 2005, Alexander MacGregor argued that while contemporary scholars, such as Goold and Volk, read Manilius as a Stoic, the Astronomica actually breaks with or contradicts Stoic tradition in a number of places. Namely, Manilius exalts Plato, Socrates, and Pythagoras; proposes a Platonic proof for the existence of God, denies the ekpyrosis (that is, a belief in the periodic destruction of the cosmos by an immense conflagration every <b>Great</b> <b>Year,</b> followed by a cosmic recreation), never discusses the six Stoic paradoxes as discussed by Cicero, and ignores the importance of controlling the soul. Manilius also focuses on a number of decidedly Pythagorean tenets: the Pythagorean order of the planets, the importance of geometry and numbers, and the significance of tetraktys (that is, triangular figures made up of ten points arranged in four rows). Finally, in key places, the poet makes use of non-Stoics like Eudoxus of Cnidus and Cicero. Given these factors, MacGregor concludes that Manilius should be classified as an idealistic Pythagorean or a Platonist rather than a Stoic.|$|E

25|$|A symphonic {{band that}} would have a <b>great</b> <b>year</b> in 1976 was ALAS. Their music was even more {{intellectual}} and unorthodox.

After Williams backed Courage in a successful 1968 Formula Two season, he purchased a Brabham Formula One car for Courage in 1969. This allegedly angered Jack Brabham, as the car had been sold to Williams {{with the expectation that}} it would be used in the Tasman Series and then converted to Formula 5000.

25|$|The {{addition}} of Jason Kidd infused the Mavericks with {{new life in}} 1994–95. Kidd averaged 11.7 points, 5.4 rebounds and 7.7 assists in his rookie season, and {{led the league in}} triple-doubles. Roy Tarpley was allowed to return to the league after three years and helped with 12.6 points and 8.2 rebounds per game. The tandem of Jim Jackson and Jamal Mashburn combined as the league's highest-scoring pair of teammates. On separate occasions, Mashburn and Jackson scored 50 points in a game that season. Mashburn contributed 24.1 points per game, fifth in the NBA; Jackson averaged 25.7 points, but suffered a severe ankle sprain in February which caused him to miss the remainder of the regular season. Second-year forward Popeye Jones had a <b>great</b> <b>year</b> as well, as he averaged 10.6 rebounds and led the NBA in offensive rebounds.|$|E

Later that month they split a pair and the Reds kept the lead. That would be how it would end. The Astros finished with their best record to that point at 89–73 and 1½ games behind the NL winner Reds.|$|E

25|$|Lithe is a Midsummer {{holiday in}} the Shire. It is {{mentioned}} in The Fellowship of the Ring. Lithe falls between Forelithe, the sixth {{month of the}} year, and Afterlithe, the seventh month. In most years there are three Lithedays: 1 Lithe, Midyear's Day, and 2 Lithe. In Leap-years there is a fourth Litheday called Overlithe between Midyear's Day and 2 Lithe. Midyear's Day and Overlithe are not assigned any weekday, while 1 Lithe always falls on a Friday and 2 Lithe is a Saturday. Lithe and the Midwinter holiday called Yule are the two major holidays in the Shire. Lithe {{is a time of}} great feasting and merriment. During Lithe, the Free Fair is held on the White Downs, where Hobbits gather to celebrate and to buy and sell goods. Every seven years at the Free Fair during Lithe, an election is held for the office of Mayor of the Shire. In the years that Overlithe occur, it is a day of special celebration. Overlithe falls during the <b>Great</b> <b>Year</b> of Plenty in 3020 after the War of the Ring, and it is the merriest holiday {{in the history of the}} Shire.|$|E
25|$|After a {{few months}} of being together, happy and in love, Robin has a {{pregnancy}} scare. Although the test is negative, she realizes she wants different things from life than Patrick. She wants more from him (children), while he is happy just the way they are. They eventually break up. Robin wants to be a mother and decides to be a single mom. She and her friend, Dr. Kelly Lee (Minae Noji), put a list of possible sperm donors together. Robin picks people in Port Charles, because she feels that they have redeeming qualities she will like to pass on to her child, and does not like the idea of her child's father being a stranger. On November 30, 2007, Patrick tells Robin that he still loves and misses her. He just wants them to be together again and asks her to table the discussion of children for a year, and while she has stated that she has never been happier than when she was with him, she knows nothing would be different in a year - she would still want kids and he would not, to which he sadly replies that she is probably right, {{but it would have been}} a <b>great</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
25|$|Greece had to {{wait for}} the EuroBasket 2001 in order to make its {{comeback}} to the international scene. The team obviously {{was in the middle of}} a transition period, during which young stars Theo Papaloukas, Antonis Fotsis, and Lazaros Papadopoulos were unable to build a highly competitive team right away. Alvertis, coming off a <b>great</b> <b>year</b> with Panathinaikos, and Giorgos Sigalas, had to show to the young generation the road to success. The first game against Italy, the reigning champion, proved that Alvertis was ready to fulfill his role. A buzzer-beating three pointer gave Greece a very impressive 83–82 win. The team, however, had not reached the level of a medal contender yet. The 105–82 loss against Russia in the next game confirmed that. Consequently, in order to reach the quarter finals, Greece's game against rising power Germany appeared to be a difficult task. After leading the game by 22, the Greek team actually collapsed against superstar Dirk Nowitzki and his teammates, giving Germany an 80–75 win. Alvertis averaged 16 points in the tournament, but Greece ended up in ninth place. It was his last opportunity to reach success with the national team as its leader, especially since Greece had not qualified for the 2002 FIBA World Championship. The transition period for the young generation was soon going to be over.|$|E

500|$|In the Solar System, {{the planets}} and the Sun lie roughly {{within the same}} flat plane, known as {{the plane of the}} ecliptic. From our {{perspective}} on Earth, the ecliptic is the path taken by the Sun across the sky {{over the course of the}} year. The twelve constellations that line the ecliptic are known as the zodiacal constellations and, annually, the Sun passes through all of them in turn. Additionally, over time, the Sun's annual cycle appears to recede very slowly backward by one degree every 72 years, or by one constellation approximately every 2,160 years. This backward movement, called [...] "precession", is due to a slight wobble in the Earth's axis as it spins, and can be compared to the way a spinning top wobbles as it slows down. Over the course of 25,800 years, a period often called a <b>Great</b> <b>Year,</b> the Sun's path completes a full, 360-degree backward rotation through the zodiac. In Western astrological traditions, precession is measured from the March equinox, one of the two annual points at which the Sun is exactly halfway between its lowest and highest points in the sky. At the end of the 20th century and beginning of the 21st, the Sun's March equinox position was in the constellation Pisces moving back into Aquarius. This signaled the end of one astrological age (the Age of Pisces) and the beginning of another (the Age of Aquarius).|$|E

500|$|In {{spin-off}} series Torchwood (2006–2011), {{the audience}} learns that Rose's act of resurrecting Jack cursed him with {{being unable to}} die. Her absence and the Doctor's pained estrangement from her proves a point of contention for the Doctor's series 3 companion Martha (Freema Agyeman); when Martha protects the Doctor, living as a human without his memories, it is still Rose that he dreams of. When the Doctor is reunited with Donna Noble (Catherine Tate) in the show's fourth series (2008), Rose mysteriously begins {{to appear in the}} Doctor's life—first seen only by Donna, and later in silent video messages which the Doctor fails to notice. When a [...] "Time Beetle" [...] creates an alternate universe in which Donna never meets the Doctor and the Doctor dies, Rose travels from her parallel world to this world, working alongside the organisation UNIT to send Donna back in time, and make Donna's younger self turn left at a junction and not right. Rose tells Donna to say two words to The Doctor; 'Bad Wolf'. The Doctor concludes this is a sign that the Universe, and reality itself is under threat. Later, in the midst of Davros' (Julian Bleach) plot to obliterate existence, Rose unites with the Doctor and his companions Donna, Martha, Jack and Sarah Jane to make a stand against him and his army of Daleks. In the midst of the battle, a part-human Doctor is created and destroys the Daleks. The Doctor returns Rose to the parallel universe along with Jackie, and his part-human counterpart. Rose challenges the Doctor to say the words he did not say to her during their previous farewell. The Doctor does not answer, but his part-human counterpart whispers in her ear and Rose kisses him. The Doctor retreats, leaving Rose behind with his part-human counterpart. In the closing scenes of The End of Time (2010), just prior to his regeneration, the Doctor travels to Rose's housing estate in the first minutes of 2005. He speaks to her from the shadows, asking her what year it is. She tells him it is January 1, 2005. The Doctor promises her that she will have a really <b>great</b> <b>year.</b>|$|E
