25|$|The {{most popular}} {{theory of the}} subgenre's christening is Possessed's 1984 demo, Death Metal; the song from the eponymous demo would also be {{featured}} on the band's 1985 debut album, Seven Churches. Possessed vocalist/bassist Jeff Becerra said he coined the term in early 1983 for a high school <b>English</b> <b>class</b> assignment. Another possible origin was a magazine called Death Metal, started by Thomas Fischer and Martin Ain of Hellhammer and Celtic Frost. The name was later given to the 1984 compilation Death Metal released by Noise Records. The term might also have originated from other recordings, such as the demo released by Death in 1984, called Death by Metal.|$|E

25|$|Gentlemen v Players was a {{first-class}} cricket match generally held in England twice {{or more a}} year {{for well over a}} century. It was held between teams consisting of amateurs (the Gentlemen) and professionals (the Players). The difference between the two was defined by the <b>English</b> <b>class</b> structure of the time, with the Players deemed to be working-class wage-earners and the Gentlemen members of the middle and upper classes, usually products of the English public school system. Whereas the Players were paid wages by their county clubs or fees by match organisers, the Gentlemen nominally claimed expenses. The whole subject of expenses was controversial and it was held that some leading amateurs were paid more for playing cricket than any professional.|$|E
