50|$|Each anti-convulsant agent has {{a unique}} side-effect profile. Valproic acid can {{frequently}} cause sedation or gastrointestinal upset, which can be minimized by giving the related drug divalproex, which is available in an <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablet.</b> These side effects tend to disappear over time. According to studies conducted in Finland in patients with epilepsy, valproate may increase testosterone levels in teenage girls and produce polycystic ovary syndrome in women who began taking the medication before age 20. Increased testosterone can lead to polycystic ovary syndrome with irregular or absent menses, obesity, and abnormal growth of hair. Therefore, young female patients taking valproate should be monitored carefully by a physician. Excessive levels of valproate can lead to impaired liver function, and liver enzymes and serum valproate level, with a target of 50-125 µg/L, should be monitored periodically.|$|E

In an effort to treat this complication after transurethral prostatic resection, achymotripsin <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablet,</b> a pancreatic proteolytic enzyme, was administered to twenty patients {{and the result was}} compared to that of twenty-one control patients. The administration of the a-chymotripsin <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablet</b> was, as a rule, started two weeks after the transurethral prostatic resection with a dosage of 2 tablets 3 times a day (1 tablet contains 100 Ch.

The duratio n of postoperative urinary tract infection in the a-chymotripsin treated group was 8. 5 weeks on the average (varied from 5 to 15 weeks) which was 3. 1 weeks shorter than that of the control group (11. 6 weeks on the average, varied from 6 to 19 weeks). No unpleasant side effect occurred in this series, except for one patient who complained of a mild degree of loss of appetite during the treatment with a-chymotripsin <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablet,</b> which disappeared soon after the completion of the treatment.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to investigate the influence of food on the bioavailability of omeprazole (20 mg) given as an <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablet</b> under repeated dose conditions. This open randomized crossover study consisted of three seven-day treatment periods, each separated by a drug-free period. During each treatment period an <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablet</b> of omeprazole was taken once daily either under fasting conditions, or immediately before or after a standardized breakfast. On the last day of each treatment period, blood samples for the determination of plasma omeprazole concentrations were collected at baseline and at predetermined intervals over the 24 h period following drug administration. Fifty-seven male and female subjects, aged 18 to 52 years, completed the study according to the protocol. No statistically significant differences were found when comparing either the before breakfast or after breakfast treatment regimens with the fasting regimen for the estimated mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve (AUC). The maximum plasma concentration was not found to differ significantly among any of the treatment regimens. However, the lower limit of the CI for the comparison of fasting/before breakfast was not contained within the limits of bioequivalence. The time to reach maximum plasma concentration was significantly different when fasting and after breakfast regimens were compared. Thus, under repeated dose conditions, food has no influence on the bioavailability (expressed as AUC) of omeprazole given as the <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablet</b> formulation...|$|E

40|$|This study {{compared}} the 24 h intragastric pH profile and bioavailability at repeated dosing {{conditions of the}} omeprazole 20 mg <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablet</b> versus the 20 mg capsule. Forty duodenal ulcer patients in asymptomatic remission completed this randomized open two-way crossover study. Omeprazole 20 mg tablets or capsules were administered for seven days in each period. A 24 h pH recording was performed {{before the start of}} treatment and on day 7 of each treatment period. Plasma concentrations of omeprazole were determined 24 h after the dose. The treatment periods were separated by two to four weeks. The difference in percentage of time with pH of at least 3 was less than 16 % in favour of the tablet (not significant). The estimated mean area under the plasma concentration-time curve as well as the maximum plasma concentration (Cmax) for omeprazole were 18 % and 41 % higher, respectively, for the tablet versus the capsule, with the latter percentage being statistically significant. The time to reach Cmax (tmax) with the tablet was, on average, about 0. 5 h longer than to reach the tmax of the capsule.

40|$|In {{the initial}} {{treatment}} of acute myocardial infarction, {{it is important}} to administer oral low-dose acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) within 10 min of arrival at the hospital.

Although current guidelines recommended that patients should chew their initial dose of ASA, there is little evidence as to whether this is efficacious. Therefore, we aimed to make a direct comparison of the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of ASA after ingestion of intact and chewed nonenteric-coated buffered ASA tablet (NBA) and enteric-coated ASA tablet (ECA) in a quadruple crossover study in healthy volunteers. Chewing ECA accelerated tmax of ASA absorption, which became equivalent to that after ingestion of intact or chewed NBA. A significant decrease in serum thromboxane B 2 was observed 20 min after ingestion of chewed ECA, or intact or chewed NBA, and inhibition of platelet aggregation was also observed within 20 min.

METHODS: Sixty subjects who gave informed consent {{were randomly assigned to}} study group A, study group B or the control group. On the day prior to CTC, subjects in study group A were given 20 mL 40 % wt/vol barium sulfate suspension before 3 mealtimes, 60 mL 60 % diatrizoate meglumine diluted in 250 mL water after supper, and 10 mg bisacodyl <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablets</b> 1 h before oral administration of 2 L PEG- 4000 electrolyte solution. Subjects in study group B were treated identically to those in study group A, with the exception of bisacodyl which was given 1 h after oral PEG- 4000. Subjects in the control group were managed using the same strategy as the subjects in study group A, but without administration of bisacodyl. Residual stool and fluid scores, the attenuation value of residual fluid, and discomfort during bowel preparation in the three groups were analyzed statistically. RESULTS: The mean scores for residual stool and fluid in study group A were lower than those in study group B, but the differences were not statistically significant. Subjects in study group A showed greater stool and fluid cleansing ability than the subjects in study group B. The mean scores for residual stool and fluid in study groups A and B were lower than those in the control group, and were significantly different.

40|$|Controlled and {{localized}} {{release of}} drugs in the intestine {{can be achieved by}} enteric coating. The design of <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablets</b> has so far remained empirical, {{in part because of the}} lack of a quantitative description of the drug release kinetics. In this paper, a mathematical model is presented that describes the dissolution of the polymer coating and release kinetics of weakly acidic drugs from <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablets</b> in buffered media. This model can also be used to predict the time of onset of core disintegration. The model assumes that the release rate is limited by diffusion, and furthermore, all the reactions are considered as reversible and instantaneous. Dissolution and reaction are assumed to take place in the polymer layer and a hypothetical stagnant liquid film adjacent to the polymer layer (the classical film theory approach). The dissolution of the enteric coating is found to depend on the intrinsic solubilities and p K a 's of the drug and polymer and the medium properties. The release rate of the drug is found to depend on the intrinsic solubilities and p K a 's of drug and polymer, the medium properties, i. e., pH and buffer capacity, and a mass transfer coefficient. Explicit relationships between the release rates and all these factors are derived. Successful prediction of experimental data indicates that the model provides an adequate description of release from enteric coated tablets. Limitations of the model and its potential application to the design of appropriate in vitro testing conditions and to the formulation of enteric coated tablets are also discussed...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Psoriasis is {{a chronic}} {{inflammatory}} skin disease {{that can be}} successfully treated {{with a mixture of}} fumaric acid esters (FAE) formulated as enteric-coated tablets for oral use. These tablets consist of dimethylfumarate (DMF) and salts of monoethylfumarate (MEF) and its main bioactive metabolite is monomethylfumarate (MMF). Little is known about the pharmacokinetics of these FAE. The aim {{of the present study was}} to investigate the hydrolysis of DMF to MMF and the stability of MMF, DMF and MEF at in vitro conditions representing different body compartments. Results DMF is hydrolyzed to MMF in an alkaline environment (pH 8), but not in an acidic environment (pH 1). In these conditions MMF and MEF remained intact during the period of analysis (6 h). Interestingly, DMF was hardly hydrolyzed to MMF in a buffer of pH 7. 4, but was rapidly hydrolyzed in human serum having the same pH. Moreover, in whole blood the half-life of DMF was dramatically reduced as compared to serum. The concentrations of MMF and MEF in serum and whole blood decreased with increasing time. These data indicate that the majority of the FAE in the circulation are metabolized by one or more types of blood cells. Additional experiments with purified blood cell fractions resuspended in phosphate buffered saline (pH 7. 4) revealed that at concentrations present in whole blood monocytes/lymphocytes, but not granulocytes and erythrocytes, effectively hydrolyzed DMF to MMF. Furthermore, in agreement with the data obtained with the pure components of the tablet, the <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablet</b> remained intact at pH 1, but rapidly dissolved at pH 8. Conclusion Together, these in vitro data indicate that hydrolysis of DMF to MMF rapidly occurs at pH 8, resembling that within the small intestines, but not at pH 1 resembling the pH in the stomach. At both pHs MMF and MEF remained intact. These data explain the observation that after oral FAE intake MMF and MEF, but not DMF, can be readily detected in the circulation of human healthy volunteers and psoriasis patients. </p...|$|E

Two phase IV trials have been conducted in the People's Republic of China, the first one enrolling 1292 adolescents and adults aged 15 - 70 years and the second one conducted with 899 children aged 4 - 14 years who were infected with one or multiple species of soil-transmitted helminths. Oral tribendimidine (single 400 mg <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablet</b> given to adolescents/adults and 200 mg to children) showed high cure rates against Ascaris lumbricoides (90. 1 - 95. 0 %) and moderate-to-high cure rates against hookworm (82. 0 - 88. 4 %). Another trial done in school-aged children using a rigorous diagnostic approach found a cure rate against hookworm of 76. 5 %. A single oral dose of tribendimidine showed only low cure rates against Trichuris trichiura (23. 9 - 36. 8 %) confirming previous results. Tribendimidine administered to children infected with Enterobius vermicularis (two doses of 200 mg each on consecutive days) resulted in a high cure rate (97. 1 %). Importantly, a series of randomised, exploratory trials revealed that tribendimidine shows interesting activity against the liver flukes Opisthorchis viverrini and Clonorchis sinensis, the tapeworm Taenia spp. and the threadworm Strongyloides stercoralis with respective cure rates of 70. 0 %, 40. 0 %, 53. 3 % and 36. 4 %. Pharmacokinetic studies in healthy Chinese volunteers indicated that after oral administration of tribendimidine, no parent drug was detected in plasma, but its primary metabolite, p-(1 -dimethylamino ethylimino) aniline (aminoamidine, deacylated amidantel) (dADT), was found in plasma. dADT is then further metabolised to acetylated dADT (AdADT). dADT exhibits activity against several species of hookworm and C. sinensis in experimental studies, similar that of tribendimidine. First studies elucidating the mechanism of action suggested that tribendimidine is an L-type nicotinic acetylcholine receptor agonist. Additional experimental studies revealed that the anti-parasite spectrum of tribendimidine is very broad. Indeed, to date, activity has been documented against 20 different nematode, trematode and cestode species. Taken together, tribendimidine warrants further scientific inquiry, including more comprehensive toxicity appraisals, mechanism of action studies and clinical investigation as it holds promise as a broad spectrum anthelminthics...|$|E
40|$|The {{electrochemical}} {{behavior of}} omeprazole on a glassy carbon electrode was investigated by cyclic voltammetry and differential pulse voltammetry. It {{was found that}} omeprazole would give a sensitive oxidation peak at + 0. 74 V in the HAc-NaAc buffer solution (pH 5. 10) under the Differential Pulse Voltammetric (DPV) mode. The peak current was linear with the concentration of omeprazole {{in the range of}} 1. 0 ~ 20 mg L - 1. Based on which, a DPV method for determination of omeprazole with the detection limit of 0. 19 mg L - 1 has been developed. The proposed method has been used for determination of omeprazole concentration in omeprazole <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablets,</b> the recovery was found to be in the range of 99. 3 ~ 102 %. The mechanism for this electrochemical reaction at the glassy carbon electrode was also discussed in this study...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Two {{brothers}} (case 1 {{and case}} 2) with erythema nodosum {{were diagnosed with}} thromboangiitis obliterans (TAO). The patients were treated with compounds including Danshen Dripping Pills, Fufang Danshen Diwan and Salvia tetramethylpyrazine. The patients were also treated with fibro-blast growth factor to promote epidermal growth and Bayaspirin <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablets</b> to reduce platelet aggregation. The poly-saccharide nucleic acid fraction of Bacillus Calmette-Guérin and compound glycyrrhizin tablets were taken to improve immune function. Following treatment, case 2 had reduced pain levels in the left foot. The ulcer on the first toe of the left foot had decreased in size, with a reduction in pus secretions and inflammation. Case 1 demonstrated a reduction in pus secretion from the ulcer. However, {{the area of the}} ulcer had increased, spreading to the fifth toe with gangrene. A tendon had become exposed on the right foot, which was broken and induced severe pain...|$|R
40|$|The {{bioavailability}} of iron in five {{ferrous sulfate}} preparations was studied in 10 healthy male volunteers. The preparations were an oral solution, {{two types of}} film-coated tablets and two types of <b>enteric-coated</b> <b>tablets.</b> Blood samples were drawn hourly from 8 am to 6 pm {{on the day before}} each study day to assess baseline serum iron concentrations and on the study day. Spectrophotometry was used to measure the serum iron concentrations. The area under the curve (AUC), the maximum concentration and the time to achieve the maximum concentration were compared by analysis of variance. The enteric-coated preparations resulted in AUCs less than 30 % of the AUC for the oral solution. The two film-coated products produced AUCs essentially equivalent to that of the oral solution. We conclude that the bioavailability of iron in the enteric-coated preparations was low, relative to that of the film-coated products and the oral solution, and that these products should not be considered interchangeable...|$|R
