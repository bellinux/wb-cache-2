Dent, Sr. and others put together in 1968, opposition to the Voting Rights Act {{would have been a}} central part of keeping the South. Now you don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> All that you need to do to keep the South is for Reagan to run in place on the issues that he's campaigned on since 1964, and that's fiscal conservatism, balancing the budget, cut taxes, you know, the whole cluster.|$|E
500|$|In 1972, Lester {{returned}} to the interscholastic ranks {{as a head coach}} at Paint Branch High School in Burtonsville, Maryland, which awarded him a ten-year contract. It was Paint Branch's third year of varsity football, and their first two campaigns had ended with 3–7 records. About the move, Lester said, [...] "I spent too long treating college players nice and making sure they were happy... I don't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> now. I can coach here. If they want to quit, fine."In 1975, he led Paint Branch to the Class B state championship.|$|E
500|$|Unlike in a {{traditional}} film soundtrack, Moore often wrote music [...] "not necessarily to always match the images on the screen, but to sometimes play against it." [...] Moore explained that {{a traditional}} soundtrack needs to convey {{the mood of the}} scene and advance the film's storyline, but that he did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> with Graveyard Mountain Home [...] "because the director's not around". [...] "I thought, well {{what would it be like}} if I did a totally different kind of mood than this scene is trying to convey? When you put that music with that scene what happens there? Sometimes it's kind of interesting what happens," [...] Moore explained.|$|E

500|$|When {{asked about}} Barris's claim {{of being a}} CIA assassin, Clooney commented, [...] "I don't know how much I {{believed}} it. I didn't want to officially ask him, because I didn't want him to say, 'I made it up.' I wanted {{to tell the story}} and I thought how interesting, if it was all made up, why someone as wealthy and as successful as Chuck Barris would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I thought that was an interesting person to explore, and that's {{what we wanted to do}} with the film." [...] (Barris had already admitted he had made the story up in a 1984 interview promoting the book; he wrote the story in large part because he had been exiled from television over the controversy surrounding one of his shows, 3's a Crowd. In the same interview, Barris noted that he had applied for work with the CIA in the early 1960s but never actually entered the agency; Confessions of a Dangerous Mind was the product of Barris imagining how he could have done both at the same time.) Clooney acknowledged that his upbringing with father Nick Clooney had a great bearing on his choice of depicting the 1960/70s game shows. [...] "My father had a game show when I was growing up called The Money Maze. I know what those sets look like. I showed the guy how to do cue cards. I grew up on them," [...] the director reflected, [...] "and knew what it looked like and smelled like. And I know something about some of the trappings of fame, so I thought I had a unique take on it." ...|$|E

You don't choose your family, but you choose what church you want to attend... hate speech [...] unacceptable in any setting... I just think you have to speak out against that. You certainly <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> if not explicitly, then implicitly by getting up and moving." ...|$|E
5000|$|DeBartolo affirms this, saying: [...] "I {{tried to}} run the 49ers like a family rather than a business. I viewed the players and myself really, basically, as a partnership. Our goal was to win the Super Bowl every year, and we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> together." ...|$|R

2500|$|Also in 1947, Hayworth was {{featured}} in a Life cover story by Winthrop Sargeant that resulted in her being nicknamed [...] "The Love Goddess". The term was adopted and used later {{as the title of}} a biopic and of a biography about her. In a 1980s interview, Hayworth said, [...] "Everybody else does nude scenes, but I don't. I never made nude movies. I didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I danced. I was provocative, I guess, in some things. But I was not completely exposed." ...|$|E
2500|$|Upon its release, All for You {{was banned}} in Singapore after the Publications Appeal Committee decided the album's lyrics, in {{particular}} [...] "Would You Mind," [...] were [...] "not acceptable to our society." [...] The country's law officials had previously banned Jackson's prior album, The Velvet Rope, due to three songs containing lyrics about homosexuality. Several retail chains, including Wherehouse Music affixed their own [...] "explicit content" [...] labels to the album. RIAA president Hilary Rosen stated, [...] "We don't think retailers should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> That's the label's responsibility, and EMI [...] has assumed that responsibility."

One of my road crew said {{we found this}} guy that {{used to work in}} the circus and he does a lot of things for TV and special effects and he's made {{something}} that might interest you, it's a piano that spins round, and I immediately responded, oh that sounds interesting. I happened to be within the New York area and I was driven over to Long Island to a guy called Bob McCarthy, and there in the background he had this piano situated. So he called his wife down from upstairs and said, darling could you demonstrate this for Keith? I looked on, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. His wife comes down and sits on the seat and up she goes in the air and proceeds to spin around. I thought, well that's great! Then Bob asked me, {{do you want to have}} a go at it?... Yea, okay. You need to understand, below the keyboard there's an inverted-tee, like a bar. You wrap your legs around the down pipe and put your heels under the inverted-tee. Then you go up in the air and try and do your best to play. It was a little difficult to play at first because of the centrifugal force, so it wasn't easy. I think we actually used it for the first time at Madison Square Garden, it was a Christmas concert. People in the audience were so astounded they couldn't quite believe what they were seeing. Later on that coming year the California Jam came up and I said we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> there. Bob drove the whole contraption down to the California Jam and there was very little space to set it up. There were loads of bands up on that stage, all having to do their set and then getting their equipment off. Now, with the moog, the Hammonds, Carl's gongs and everything, it was hard enough to just get that off stage. We had the spinning piano and everything that went along with it and we tried to find a place to situate it. It ended up going just at the end of the stage, so when the piano went up it was literally over the heads of the audience. After that every TV show I did came the question... Keith, how do you spin around on that piano? I'd say what about my music? When I had the honor of meeting the great jazz pianist Dave Brubeck just before he died, he said, Keith you've got to tell me how do you spin around on that piano? Dave Brubeck was 90 years old then and I said, 'Dave, don't try it!'" ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{changes to}} User Account Control on Windows 7 were {{criticized for being}} {{potentially}} insecure, as an exploit was discovered allowing untrusted software to be launched with elevated privileges by exploiting a trusted component.
