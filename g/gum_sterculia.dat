5000|$|Gum karaya or <b>gum</b> <b>sterculia,</b> {{also known}} as Indian gum tragacanth, is a {{vegetable}} gum produced as an exudate by trees of the genus Sterculia. Chemically, gum karaya is an acid polysaccharide composed of the sugars galactose, rhamnose and galacturonic acid. It {{is used as a}} thickener and emulsifier in foods, as a laxative, and as a denture adhesive. It is also used to adulterate [...] Gum tragacanth due to their similar physical characteristics. As a food additive it has E number E416.|$|E
40|$|Natural exudate <b>gum</b> (<b>sterculia</b> gum) {{has been}} {{successfully}} used as gelling agent in culture media with an aim to reduce the production cost of tissue culture raised plants. Shoot tips were cultured on agar and sterculia gum gelled media to study the difference in shoot and root regeneration response. Initially, shoot tips were cultured on agar gelled Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium supplemented with different concentrations of 6 -Benzyl amino purine (BAP), Kinetin (KN) and Naphthalene acetic acid (NAA). Maximum percentage of cultures showing shoot regeneration (63. 19 %) was observed on agar gelled MS medium containing BAP 1. 5, KN 0. 5 and NAA 0. 5 mg L - 1. Sterculia gum and agar were then evaluated at different concentrations and combinations. The media gelled with sterculia gum was equally transparent as that of liquid medium. The shoot regeneration response on media gelled with 25 and 30 g L - 1 sterculia gum were 49. 99 and 61. 11 % respectively. Regenerated shoots were rooted on agar gelled MS medium supplemented with different concentrations of Indole- 3 -Acetic Acid (IAA), NAA and Indole - 3 -butyric acid (IBA, 0. 5 - 2. 5 mg L - 1). Maximum rooting response (56. 94 %) was observed with IBA 2. 0 mg L - 1. Same medium when evaluated for rooting response using sterculia gum (30 g L - 1) as gelling agent, 56. 24 % cultures showed root regeneration. The difference in regeneration response obtained with agar (8 g L - 1) and sterculia gum (30 g L - 1) was statistically insignificant. This study indicates that sterculia gum {{can be used as}} alternative gelling agent in place of agar for the development of cost effective micropropagation protocol...|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we take {{advantage}} of the polyelectrolyte character of some Brazilian native gums to fabricate electrically conductive, nanostructured films. The <b>gums</b> <b>Sterculia</b> urens, (caraia), Sterculia striata (chicha) or Anadenanthera macrocarpa Benth were assembled in conjunction with poly(o-methoxyaniline) (POMA) in the form of layered nanostructured films using the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique. All the LbL films displayed a well-defined electroactivity, as confirmed via cyclic voltammetry. In comparison to POMA LbL films fabricated with conventional polyelectrolytes (viz. poly(vinyl sulfonic acid) -PVS), the presence of the gums in the LbL films increased remarkably the electrochemical stability of the films...|$|R

40|$|Com o objetivo de preservar as propriedades e otimizar o encapsulamento do Ãleo essencial de Lippia sidoides (OELS), foi preparado nanopartÃculas de quitosana e goma carregadas com OELS via spray-drying, usando gomas nativas da regiÃo do Nordeste brasileiro. As gomas foram extraÃdas dos exsudatos das Ãrvores da Anacardium Occidentale (goma do cajueiro), Sterculia striata (goma do chichÃ) e Anadenanthera macrocarpa (goma do angico). As nanopartÃculas foram caracterizadas por espectroscopia na regiÃo do infravermelho (FTIR) e na regiÃo do UV/VIS, tamanho de partÃculas e potencial zeta, anÃlise tÃrmica (TGA/DSC), e cromatografia gasosa (GC-MS). O espectro do FTIR mostrou as principais bandas da quitosana e das gomas, em 1550 e em 1647 cm- 1. Observou-se diferentes propriedades nas nanopartÃculas em funÃÃo do tipo de matriz utilizada. As partÃculas produzidas apresentaram tamanho de 17 a 800 nm, onde a matriz de goma do cajueiro produziu as partÃculas maiores, e a matriz de goma do chichÃ as partÃculas menores. O potencial zeta variou de - 40 mV a + 30 mV, onde houve maior variaÃÃo quando utilizou-se a matriz com goma do chichÃ. A anÃlise tÃrmica evidenciou os eventos de perda de massa para as amostras, onde atÃ 200 ÂC as amostras perdem no mÃximo 20 % da sua massa inicial. O encapsulamento do OELS variou entre 6 e 16 %, onde as matrizes com goma do cajueiro e do chichÃ apresentaram os maiores valores. As amostras com goma do cajueiro apresentaram boa estabilidade de encapsulamento apÃs 12 meses, onde o teor de Ãleo encapsulado nÃo se alterou. A anÃlise por cromatografia gasosa mostrou que o Ãleo encapsulado nÃo apresentou em sua composiÃÃo diferenÃa significativa Ã do Ãleo inicial, encapsulando os principais componentes. A liberaÃÃo do OELS pelas matrizes foi relativamente lenta, onde entre 60 e 100 % do Ãleo foi liberado em 48 horas. O estudo cinÃtico da liberaÃÃo do OELS indicou que a liberaÃÃo segue o modelo de Higuchi, com a liberaÃÃo pelas amostras variando entre fenÃmenos fickianos e nÃo-fickianos. Aiming to {{preserve}} the properties and optimize the encapsulation of the Lippia sidoides essential oil (LSEO), this work reports on the preparation of chitosan-gum nanoparticles loaded with LSEO by spray-drying, using gums extracted from native trees of northeast of Brazil. The gums used were extracted from exudates of Anacardium Occidentale tree (Cashew <b>gum),</b> <b>Sterculia</b> striata trees (ChichÃ gum) and Anadenanthera macrocarpa trees (Angico gum). Samples were characterized by FTIR and UV/VIS spectroscopy, particle size and zeta potential, thermal analysis (TGA/DSC) and gas chromatography (GC-MS). The FTIR spectrum showed the main bands of chitosan and gums, in 1550 and 1647 cm- 1. Particle sizes ranged from 17 nm to 800 nm, where the angico gum matrix presented the smallest sizes and cashew gum matrix the larger sizes. The zeta potential varied from - 40 mV + 30 mV, where chichÃ gum matrix presented the biggest variation. Thermal analysis showed the events of mass loss for the samples, where up to 200 Â C there are a maximum of 20 % mass lost compared to the initial mass. The encapsulation of LSEO ranged between 6 and 16 %, where the cashew gum and chichÃ gum matrixes presented the highest values. Cashew gum samples showed good encapsulation stability after 12 months, where the encapsulated oil content has not changed. The encapsulated oil did not present significant difference in its composition to the initial oil, encapsulating the key components. The release of LSEO from the matrixes was relatively slow, where between 60 and 100 % of the oil was released in 48 hours. The kinetic study of LSEO release indicated that the release followed the Higuchi model, with the release by the samples varying between fickians and non-fickians phenomena...|$|E
30|$|Green {{chemistry}} {{is a set}} of principles or practices that encourage the design of products and processes that reduce or eliminate the use and generation of hazardous substances [56 – 58]. Current green nanotechnology practices often involve the use of natural sources, non-hazardous solvents, biodegradable and biocompatible materials and energy-efficient processes in the preparation of NPs [59]. As an example, biopolymers, such as cellulose, chitosan, dextran or tree gums, are often used as reducing and stabilising agents for metal NP synthesis [12, 60 – 62]. Gum karaya (GK) used in this study is a natural tree <b>gum</b> from <b>Sterculia</b> consisting of approximately 13 – 26 % galactose and 15 – 30 % rhamnose, 30 – 43 % galacturonic acid, 37 % uronic acid residues and about 8 % acetyl groups [63]. Toxicological studies proved GK as non-toxic, allowing its use even as a food additive [62 – 65].|$|R
40|$|The {{search for}} natural, {{biocompatible}} and degradable materials amenable {{to be used}} in biomedical/analytical applications has attracted attention, either from the environmental or medical point of view. Examples are the polysaccharides extracted from natural gums, which have found applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries as stabilizers or thickening agent. In a previous paper, however, it was shown that a Brazilian natural <b>gum,</b> chicha (<b>Sterculia</b> striata), is suitable for application as building block for nanostructured film fabrication in conjunction with phthalocyanines. The films displayed electroactivity and could be used in sensing. In the present paper, we introduce the use of two different natural gums, viz., angico (Anadenanthera colubrina) and caraia (Sterculia urens), as active biomaterials to be used to modification layers, in the form of nanostructured thin films, including the study of dopamine detection. The multilayer films were assembled in conjunction with nickel tetrasulfonated phthalocyanines (NiTsPC) and displayed good chemical and electrochemical stability, allowing their use as transducer elements in sensors for detection of specific neurotransmitters. It is suggested here that nanoscale manipulation of new biodegradable natural polymers opens up a variety of new opportunities for the use of these materials in advanced biomedical and analytical devices.

40|$|The {{nutritional}} and anti-nutritive {{composition of}} Karaya <b>gum</b> tree (<b>Sterculia</b> setigera) seed collected from Federal College of Wildlife Management estate, New Bussa, Nigeria was evaluated from October to December, 2013 {{with the aim}} of providing data that will guide the effective utilization and inclusion of this under exploited tropical plant seed in fish feed formulation. The seeds were washed, dried, grounded and analyzed for the proximate composition, vitamin and mineral contents as well as the anti-nutritive factors using standard procedures. The result showed that the mean values for the proximate composition were: moisture 5. 20 %, ash 3. 95 %, fat 26. 03 %, fiber 6. 15 %, protein 13. 39 % and carbohydrate 45. 27 %. The plant also contained vitamins and relatively adequate essential mineral elements of nutritional importance of macro elements such as calcium, potassium, sodium, magnesium and micro elements of iron, manganese, zinc and copper. Some anti-nutritional factor such as; alkaloids, phytate, cardiac glycosides, flavonoids, steroids and trace of oxalate were also found in the plant, but their composition will pose no serious nutritional problem if well processed before its inclusion in fish diet and could therefore be a cheap source of raw materials for the fortification applications in various fish feed formulations...|$|R
30|$|A {{number of}} methods were {{opted for the}} removal of metal ions from aqueous {{solutions}} (Alothman and Apblett 2009, 2010). These include ion exchange (Petruzzelli et al. 1999), solvent extraction (Gupta et al. 2003) reverse osmosis, electrodialysis (Hasar 2003), precipitation (Remoudaki et al. 2003), flocculation (Zhao et al. 2005), sorption (Sharma et al. 1991), activated carbon adsorption and membrane separation processes (Yan and Viraraghavan 2001). However, these techniques have one major drawback that they involve high capital and operational cost. Among these, biosorption {{has proved to be a}} potential alternative to these techniques due to its high efficiency, ease of operation, simplicity of design, and comparable low cost (Chowdhury and Saha 2010; Saha et al. 2010). Though commercial activated charcoal has proved its worth as an efficient adsorbent, its higher cost limits its wider application (Babel and Kurniawan 2003). Thus, different forms of inexpensive, easily available and effective biosorbents such as waste acorn of cashew nut shell (Kumar et al. 2012), sugar cane dust (Mondal et al. 2011), lotus stalks (Huang et al. 2010), pine cone activated carbon (Momčilović et al. 2011), Tamarindus indica (Chowdhury and Saha 2011), <b>gum</b> karaya (<b>Sterculia</b> urens) (Vinod et al. 2011), fluted pumpkin seed shell (Okoye et al. 2010), Melocanna baccifera (Lalhruaitluanga et al. 2011) have been widely used as potential adsorbents for heavy metals.|$|R
40|$|The overall {{objective}} of the present research was to develop productivity equations of gum karaya (tartar <b>gum)</b> from <b>Sterculia</b> spp. as related to measurable growth parameters (height, diameter and crown height). The total area {{for this study was}} 75 hectare representing three locations each covering 25 hectare (500 m x 500 m). In each site, 50 sample plots were randomly chosen using random tables and GPS. The closest three trees to the centre of the each sample plot were selected for tapping by using an axe. The targeted trees for tapping were 116 trees from ALmazlagan area, 141 and 135 trees from bottom and top of Gabal Alahmar, respectively. Diameter at breast height (dbh), tree height (h) and crown height (ch) were measured for each tree and 8 gum collections were carried out for the sample trees starting from October 2006 to May 2007. Gum from each tree was collected, weighed and recorded for each selected sample tree. The data were analyzed using excel (spread sheet), SAS and JMP programs. Linear regression was used between measurable parameters with monthly gum picking and total gum production. The results for the three locations showed that there were significant differences between measurable parameters and monthly gum picking and crown height. In site Π; {{there was a significant difference}} in monthly gum picking and total gum production between diameter at breast height and average tree height. A total of 84 equations were developed for the three locations. The most important equations were relationships between height and diameter at breast height, crown height and diameter at breast height and crown height and height. The most important equations relating gum production and measurable parameters were relationships between total vi production and diameter at breast height, total production and crown height and total production and height The study showed that the maximum gum production is on the mountain top followed by the mountain bottom with the least production in the plateau. The hottest months of the year (March, April and May) yielded the best gum quality and quantit...|$|R
