5|$|Banksia cuneata is {{most easily}} {{distinguished}} from the other two species in B.subg. Isostylis by its brighter <b>flowers</b> <b>and</b> duller leaves. It further differs from B.ilicifolia in its smaller habit; its smooth bark; its smaller leaves, <b>flowers</b> <b>and</b> fruit; and in its sequence of flower colour changes. The leaves, <b>flowers</b> <b>and</b> fruit of B.oligantha are smaller still, and its foliage is not as prickly as that of B.cuneata.|$|E

The result was the Silly Symphony <b>Flowers</b> <b>and</b> Trees, the first film commercially released in full Technicolor. <b>Flowers</b> <b>and</b> Trees was a major success, and all Silly Symphonies were subsequently produced in Technicolor.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{statistical}} relationship between climatic variables and aspects of cotton production (G. barbadense), {{and the effects}} of climatic factors prevailing prior to flowering or subsequent to boll setting on <b>flower</b> <b>and</b> boll production and retention in cotton. Also, the study covers the predicted effects of climatic factors during convenient intervals (in days) on cotton <b>flower</b> <b>and</b> boll production compared with daily observation. Further, cotton <b>flower</b> <b>and</b> boll production as affected by climatic factors and soil moisture status has been considered. Evaporation, sunshine duration, relative humidity, surface soil temperature at 1800 h, and maximum air temperature are the important climatic factors that significantly affect <b>flower</b> <b>and</b> boll production. The least important variables were found to be surface soil temperature at 0600 h and minimum temperature. The five-day interval was found to be more adequately and sensibly related to yield parameters. Evaporation, minimum humidity and sunshine duration were the most effective climatic factors during preceding and succeeding periods on boll production and retention. There was a negative correlation between <b>flower</b> <b>and</b> boll production and either evaporation or sunshine duration, while that correlation with minimum relative humidity was positive. The soil moisture status showed low and in significant correlation with <b>flower</b> <b>and</b> boll production. Higher minimum relative humidity, short period of sunshine duration, and low temperatures enhanced <b>flower</b> <b>and</b> boll formation...|$|R

5|$|Each of the game's worlds feature eight main levels, with a boss {{appearing}} {{at the end}} of every fourth and eighth level. Hidden throughout each of these levels are five <b>Flowers</b> <b>and</b> twenty Red Coins, the latter of which are hidden behind specific coins in each level. Collecting Flowers adds flowers to the gate {{at the end of}} each level (not including boss levels). If the player manages to land on an open flower after jumping through the end gate, they can play a bonus game during which they can earn extra lives or bonus items that can be activated from the pause menu, such as additional stars or maginifying glasses that reveal the location of hidden Red Coins. At the end of each level, players receive a score based on how many <b>Flowers</b> <b>and</b> Red Coins they found, as well as how many stars they have remaining, with a maximum score of 100 awarded for finding all <b>Flowers</b> <b>and</b> Red Coins and ending the level with 30 stars.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the reproductive phenorhythms of tree species in a tropical seasonal lowland forest in Southeastern Brazil. Every two weeks, five individuals of 41 species were observed for {{the occurrence of}} <b>flowering</b> <b>and</b> fruiting, from May 1982 to December 1992. All phenophases showed high seasonality, when considering the whole set of species, but the amplitude of the cycles was much more variable between years; only 13 species had regular <b>flowering.</b> Infra-annual <b>flowering</b> <b>and</b> fruiting were found in 11 and four species, respectively, while only one species <b>flowered</b> <b>and</b> fruited continually. Supra-annual cycles were observed in four (<b>flowering)</b> <b>and</b> seven (fruiting) species. An increase was observed in number of species <b>and</b> individuals <b>flowering</b> <b>and</b> fruiting from 1990 to 1992, following mainly an elevation in the absolute minimum air temperature. These data suggest a relationship between reproductive phenology and major climatic phenomena like El Niño events and solar activity cycles. © International Society for Tropical Ecology...|$|R
