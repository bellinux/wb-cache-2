5|$|Across the Western Caribbean, {{the storm}} {{produced}} heavy rainfall, causing some minor damage. In Florida, a moderate storm tide caused coastal damage and flooding, while Alberto's outer rainbands produced several tornadoes. The storm was indirectly responsible for two drownings {{off the coast}} of Tampa Bay. In North Carolina, heavy rainfall caused locally severe flooding, and one child drowned in a flooded storm drain near Raleigh. The remnants of Alberto produced strong winds and left four people missing <b>in</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Canada. Overall, damage was minor along Alberto's path.|$|E
5|$|Although Dean {{remained}} {{away from}} the United States coastline, it produced storm tides of 1.7ft (0.51m) to North Carolina. <b>In</b> <b>Atlantic</b> Canada, hurricane-force winds were reported in Nova Scotia and Sable Island. Newfoundland reported winds of only 50mph (80km/h). Moderate rainfall was reported on Newfoundland, with most areas of the island experiencing at least 1in (25.4mm) of precipitation. Rainfall on Newfoundland peaked at 2.7in (68.58mm) on the south coast of the island, near the location of Dean's landfall. A majority of rainfall was reported {{on the west side}} of Dean, but minimal precipitation had been recorded to the east of the storm.

Ophelia prompted the Canadian Hurricane Centre's first ever tropical storm warnings which were canceled when Ophelia became extratropical.|$|E

5|$|Danny {{had only}} minor effects on land. However, it {{triggered}} high surf and rip currents from Florida through the Mid-Atlantic states, {{leading to the}} death of a 12-year-old boy in North Carolina.

At one point, some weather forecasts predicted Danny to rapidly strengthen, and hit Nantucket as a Category 1 Hurricane, although this never occurred.
