500|$|The {{idea for}} Augusta National {{originated}} with Bobby Jones, {{who wanted to}} build a golf course after his retirement from the game. He sought advice from Clifford Roberts, who later became the chairman of the club. They came across a piece of land in Augusta, Georgia, of which Jones said: [...] "Perfect! [...] And to think this ground has been lying here all these years waiting <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> along and lay a golf course upon it." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{laughing}} gas {{has been in}} desperately short supply at Holby of late. [...] What they really need is <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> along and prove that heart transplants can be fun. It's a job for comedy cardiac specialist Percy Durant (guest star Ade Edmondson), who we last saw working out in Ghana with consultant Ric. You could easily imagine Percy driving around in a van with a big, red, plastic heart on top of it, or cracking open someone's chest and pulling out a bunch of flowers. And {{when it comes to}} Lisa (Luisa Bradshaw-White), he magically comes up with the answer to all her problems.|$|E
500|$|Yusef is {{introduced}} {{as part of}} a storyline involving the Masood family. Tamwar dates Afia and when Yusef {{is introduced}} to Tamwar's parents Masood and Zainab, Masood [...] "explodes" [...] with anger at the sight of him, recognising him as a man from their past. Ganatra explained that although Yusef allegedly tried to save Zainab from the fire, all Masood saw was Zainab locked in a burning kitchen: [...] "we are only playing it from each person's point of view. Yusef is playing it {{from his point of view}} that he did try and save her. Masood is saying, 'All I know is that I went back to get her and she had been locked in this kitchen and it was on fire'." [...] Patel said the storyline is a shocking one with a clever twist. In March2011, Bhatti said he was staying with EastEnders until around June 2011, and would [...] "see from there". He made his first appearance on 23November2010. Ganatra spoke at the British Soap Awards 2011 to Digital Spy and praised the impact of Yusef saying,"He's very much an arch-villain - he's a great character who's there to put jeopardy into the Masoods' relationship. Zainab and Masood have been married for 28 years and they're mad about each other - <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and destroy that slightly, it's exciting. It's exciting for us to play." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Someday" [...] {{is a song}} by Filipino singer Nina {{from her}} 2006 self-titled fourth album. It was {{released}} as the album's second commercial single in November 2006 by Warner Music Philippines. The song was written and composed by Nyoy Volante, who was her boyfriend at that time, and it was produced by Warner personnel Neil Gregorio. The song tells {{a story of a}} girl who was left by her loved, but still hopes <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> better <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> It was entirely recorded using an acoustic piano by Bobby Velasco.|$|R
50|$|During {{her first}} year of {{gardening}} and for many after, Ruth employed conventional techniques and practices in her garden with mixed results. She had <b>to</b> wait <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and plow the fields before she could start. This gentleman was frequently late or delays would occur due to mechanical failures. Wasted time lessened the already short growing season and tried her patience. Furthermore, the manual labor involved in planting a traditional garden became more than she could handle by herself. In the Spring of 1944, Stout decided that she wasn't {{going to wait for}} the plowman, nor was she going to plow on her own. Instead she planted the seeds and covered them, waiting to see what would happen, and discovered surprising success.|$|R
500|$|Though {{the film}} is presumed lost, a {{synopsis}} of the film was published in The Moving Picture World on June 18, 1910. It states: [...] "Hans is a little Dutch boy, {{the son of a}} poor fisherman. He, like all children of Holland, is early impressed {{with the fact that the}} safety of the whole community depends on the strength of the dike. He is sent upon an errand to his aunt late one evening. Walking along the foot of the dike, he discovers a tiny hole, through which the water is pouring. Realizing that if left to flow through even this small aperture, the water would soon break down the dike and flood the village, he sticks his tiny finger in the hole, and waits <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to his assistance. Night comes on. His family decided he has stayed with his aunt, and do not worry about him. In the morning he is found almost unconscious from fatigue and exposure, by his little sister who has been searching for him. She runs back and notifies the villagers, who come to his assistance, repair the dike, and carry the little hero back to the village in triumph. He is received by the burgomaster and praised by the minister. By his night's heroism he has made himself a place in history, and will always be known as 'the little hero of Holland.'" ...|$|E

Lavigne appeared in the June/July cover story for Inked magazine, where she discussed and showed off her tattoos, including an [...] "Abbey Dawn" [...] on her left forearm and an [...] "XXV" [...] and star on her right. Although she confirmed the [...] "fuck" [...] tattoo verbally in the article (calling it her [...] "favorite word") she had it applied after the magazine's photo shoot. She added that she eventually {{wanted to get a}} [...] "big-ass heart with a flag through it with a name... I'm going to wait a few years and make sure I still want it then. I have to wait <b>for</b> that special <b>someone</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back into my life." [...] In July 2010, Lavigne had her boyfriend's name, [...] "Brody", tattooed beneath her right breast. The couple announced that they broke up in January 2012.|$|R
5000|$|Chief Yoom-Tee-Bee died in 1910 but, as {{a result}} of his and McWhorter’s efforts, the Jones bill died in Congress in 1914. Later that year, McWhorter {{received}} a letter of thanks from Yoom-Tee-Bee’s successor, Stwire G. Watters, who wrote, [...] "We prayed <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> like you <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> us." [...] McWhorter was adopted as an honorary member by the Yakama tribe, being given the name Hemene Ka-Wan, or Old Wolf. He continued as an active force in the Yakima Indian reservation for the rest of his life, attending council meetings, and acting as a mediator between the Yakama and the Bureau of Indian Affairs. In 1916 he published [...] "The Continued Crime Against the Yakamas", another pamphlet about their treatment by the government. McWhorter’s advocacy for Indian rights against the oppression of the US government was a lifelong mission. It contributed to his passion for recording Indian history as narrated from Indian perspectives.|$|R
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Phoenix FM, backstage at the Brentwood Music Festival in July 2015, Harley also spoke of the song's development: [...] "Well it's a song, a good song. It started life written by Jim Cregan and Robert Hart, and they {{gave it to me}} five years ago. And I sat on it, it's been sitting on my computer for five years, and I hear it now and again and think I really like this song. Then I said to Jim and Robert, look, you know, it needs extra, it needs a middle eight, the new section, and are you in for giving me a free hand. Because it's like, well, they've had a song for five/six years that hasn't done anything, so its not earning them anything. So they're quite happy <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> like me <b>to</b> <b>come</b> along and say I'm gonna make some alterations for a bit of the publishing, obviously it's business. But I mean they just said get on with it, so I made some changes and I've made a record of it. And we're really pleased with it. We're going to play it today in the set." ...|$|R

40|$|Under {{both the}} prior and current laws, a {{creditor}} seeking {{to satisfy a}} judgment out of property of the judgment debtor obtains a writ of execution from the {{clerk of the court}} that issued the judgment and then delivers the writ to a sheriff in one of Florida 2 ̆ 7 s sixty-seven counties. The writ commands the sheriff to levy on property of the debtor until the amount stated in the writ is satisfied. Under the prior law, delivery of the writ to the sheriff not only initiated the execution process, but under the seminal case of Love v. Williams, it also created an inchoate lien on all personal property subject to execution in that county. The sheriff was required to keep a record of the delivery of such writs in an execution docket. If the judgment debt was not satisfied out of the proceeds of the initial levy, or if there were no levy, the sheriff would keep the writ and the inchoate lien would continue, attaching to any new personal property the debtor might bring into the county. The effect of the inchoate lien was that if anyone were to cause the sheriff to levy on personalty of the debtor, the inchoate lien would ripen into a true lien which would date from the original moment of delivery to the sheriff. Having levied, the sheriff would sell under the writ first delivered. The proceeds of the execution sale were then distributed in the order in which the existing writs had been delivered to the sheriff. As I have discussed elsewhere, there were two significant problems with this process. The foremost criticism was that the inchoate lien operated as a secret lien. Most people buying or lending against property did not know of or bother to check the sheriff 2 ̆ 7 s docket to see if the property might be subject to an inchoate execution lien. If so, and if the sheriff were later to levy on the property, they would lose it. This result flies squarely {{in the face of the}} fundamental policy in debtor-creditor law of protecting good faith transferees from unfair surprise. The second major criticism of the process was that it had the occasional effect of insulating debtors from the collection efforts of diligent creditors. Imagine a would-be diligent judgment creditor who found nonexempt property of the debtor and took steps to levy on it, only to check the docket and discover a number of prior inchoate lienors passively waiting <b>for</b> <b>someone</b> else <b>to</b> <b>come</b> along and levy on the property of the debtor. If the buildup of prior writs was substantial enough, the judgment creditor 2 ̆ 7 s only reasonable response would be to give up. The debtor then would continue to enjoy assets that could have been applied to payment of the debt, insulated from the efforts of the diligent judgment creditor by the buildup of prior inchoate liens. The new lien law has a number of salutary features, but the primary motivation to enact it was the desire to eliminate these problems. My purpose here is to describe and provide examples as to how the new law is intended to work, how it intersects with other law, how portions of the law came into being, what problems concerned us, and how we sought to remedy those concerns. I also point out areas in which the statute is flawed or inadequate and suggest how, consistent with the goals of the statute, those problems might be approached...|$|R
