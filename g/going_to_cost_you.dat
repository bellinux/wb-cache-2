[...] "What I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do may <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> a good deal of money, and my {{appointment}} to the Shasta is, of course, in your hands. I am going straight from here to Merril's house." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Devine, dryly, [...] "I {{guess you}} could. In this country they call any trail easy {{that you can}} crawl up {{on your hands and}} knees. Still, that little grading's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> about two {{thousand}} dollars a mile." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Stirling, [...] "it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> just {{whatever}} I {{like to call}} it. I can swing {{every dollar}} that stock stands {{for up to two}} or three. Will you do me the favor to glance at that certificate?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Well, then, what I'm {{going to}} say is in your interest, and you've got to believe that I have some {{authority}} for saying it. I can't tell you just how much, for I don't know as I know myself exactly. But I {{think you can get}} back if you work it right. Of course, you can't get back for nothing. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> something. It's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> all you've brought with you,"--Pinney watched Northwick's impassive face for the next change that should pass upon it; he caught it, and added--"and more. But I happen to know that the balance will be forthcoming when it's needed. I can't say how I know it, for I don't exactly know how I know it. But I do know it; and you know that it's for you to take the first step. You must say how much money you brought with you, and where it is, and how it can be got at. I should think," [...] said Pinney, with a drop in his earnestness, and as if the notion had just occurred to him, [...] "you would want to see that place of yours again." ...|$|E
60|$|In German streets {{you must}} not shoot with a crossbow. The German law- maker does not content himself with the misdeeds of the average man--the crime one feels one wants to do, but must not: he worries himself imagining all the things a {{wandering}} maniac might do. In Germany {{there is no law}} against a man standing on his head {{in the middle of the}} road; the idea has not occurred to them. One of these days a German statesman, visiting a circus and seeing acrobats, will reflect upon this omission. Then he will straightway set to work and frame a clause forbidding people from standing on their heads in the middle of the road, and fixing a fine. This is the charm of German law: misdemeanour in Germany has its fixed price. You are not kept awake all night, as in England, wondering whether you will get off with a caution, be fined forty shillings, or, catching the magistrate in an unhappy moment for yourself, get seven days. You know exactly what your fun is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you.</b> You can spread out your money on the table, open your Police Guide, and plan out your holiday to a fifty pfennig piece. For a really cheap evening, I would recommend walking on the wrong side of the pavement after being cautioned not to do so. I calculate that by choosing your district and keeping to the quiet side streets you could walk for a whole evening on the wrong side of the pavement at a cost of little over three marks.|$|E

5000|$|Miss Info, a {{co-host of}} the now defunct radio show, made known her {{disagreement}} with the song being aired on the radio. Miss Jones accused her of feeling superior probably because she was Asian, and Todd Lynn, another co-host of then-radio show said afterward {{that he thought he}} was going to start shooting Asians. Within about a week many listeners, politicians and civil rights groups held a protest rally outside Hot 97. New York City Councilman John Liu and Charles Barron talked to media and press reporters about this fiasco and demanded that disciplinary action be taken against Hot 97. Councilwoman Letitia James noted [...] "If you're going to profit from hate, it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> and it's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> dearly." [...] The week following this protest rally, rap pioneer Afrika Bambaataa and other listeners held another protest rally, targeting Hot 97's misappropration of the hip hop culture and demanded a format change. Simultaneously, Sprint and McDonald's as well as New York Newsday pulled their advertising from the station, resulting in the station's financial losses.|$|E

The Attorney General then withdraws his waiver, whispering “that laugh is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>cost</b> <b>you</b> your neck” to Powers and promptly badgers and confuses June so that she blurts out an identification of Powers as the killer.|$|E
