5|$|Agârbiceanu {{spent his}} last {{decade and a}} half under a {{communist}} regime that outlawed his church, an act in which he refused to cooperate. Much of his work, with its transparent Christian moralizing, proved incompatible with the new ideology, and was banned by communist censors; however, the regime found him useful for <b>its</b> <b>image,</b> and bestowed honors upon him. Agârbiceanu's full contribution has been made available since the 1990s, but he endures as a largely forgotten author, {{with the possible exception of}} his Apuseni-based novella, Fefeleaga.|$|E
5|$|Alfonsín {{stayed on}} as {{president}} of the UCR, leaving after the party's defeat in the 1991 legislative elections. Suffering damage to <b>its</b> <b>image</b> because of the hyperinflation of 1989, the UCR lost in several districts. Alfonsín became president of the party again in 1993. He supported the creation of a special budget for the province of Buenos Aires, led by governor Eduardo Duhalde. The radical legislator Leopoldo Moreau supported the new budget even more vehemently than the Peronists. Both parties had an informal alliance in the province. Alfonsín also supported the amendment to the constitution of Buenos Aires that allowed Duhalde to run for re-election.|$|E

5|$|Despite <b>its</b> <b>image</b> as a {{port and}} {{industrial}} city, Haifa is the cultural hub of northern Israel. During the 1950s, mayor Abba Hushi made a special effort to encourage authors and poets {{to move to}} the city, and founded the Haifa Theatre, a repertory theater, the first municipal theater founded in the country. The principal Arabic theater servicing the northern Arab population is the al-Midan Theater. Other theaters in the city include the Krieger Centre for the Performing Arts and the Rappaport Art and Culture Center. The Congress Center hosts exhibitions, concerts and special events.|$|E

By contesting the election in all nineteen constituencies, the party won the right to state-sponsored television and radio time but still had no more than 300 registered members. In the 1990 local elections the Centre Democrats won eleven seats, then, in the 1991 provincial elections, three seats in the provincial parliament.|$|E

5|$|It {{should be}} born {{in mind that the}} {{characteristics}} of the filter predicted by the image method are only accurate if the section is terminated with <b>its</b> <b>image</b> impedance. This is usually not true of the sections at either end which are usually terminated with a fixed resistance. The further the section is {{from the end of the}} filter, the more accurate the prediction will become since the effects of the terminating impedances are masked by the intervening sections. It is usual to provide half half-sections at the ends of the filter with m = 0.6 as this value gives the flattest Zi in the passband and hence the best match in to a resistive termination.|$|E

5|$|Many early {{reports of}} the riots, {{starting}} with one from Reuters, used a picture purporting to show the previous day's riots. The photo, showing large number of People's Armed Police squares, was one taken of the 2009 Shishou riot and originally published on 26 June by Southern Metropolis Weekly. The same picture was mistakenly used by other agencies; {{it was on the}} website of The Daily Telegraph, but was removed a day later. In an interview with Al Jazeera on 7 July, WUC leader Rebiya Kadeer used the same Shishou photograph to defend the Uyghurs in Ürümqi. A World Uyghur Congress representative later apologised, explaining that the photo was chosen out of hundreds for <b>its</b> <b>image</b> quality.|$|E

Sinclair had previously made its name as a mail-order retailer – the ZX81 was initially available only through mail-order – but the only truly effective way to reach the mass market was via high street stores. Fortunately for Sinclair, an opportunity to do just that was provided by W.H. Smith, a venerable book- and magazine-seller and stationery chain. The company had stagnated in the 1970s and was looking for ways to revitalise <b>its</b> <b>image</b> and expand its product range.|$|E

5|$|The {{book was}} welcomed by many critics and reviewers, who found its {{arguments}} convincing and its synthesis {{of a large}} volume of historical evidence compelling.

5|$|While the ACLU {{rushed to}} defend <b>its</b> <b>image</b> against {{allegations}} {{of being a}} communist front, it also worked to protect witnesses who were being harassed by the HUAC.

The ACLU defended many persons who were prosecuted under the Smith Act, including labor leader Harry Bridges.|$|E
5|$|After {{a couple}} of months pondering his future career plans, he {{received}} a telephone call from the Stockport County chairman, Victor Bernard, who offered him the position of general manager. Stockport was a struggling lower league club with a small budget, and Trautmann's appointment was an attempt to improve <b>its</b> <b>image.</b> Many people in the local area supported one of the two Manchester clubs, so to stimulate interest Trautmann and Bernard decided to move matches to Friday evenings, when neither Manchester club would be playing. This improved revenue, but the team continued to struggle. Trautmann resigned in 1966 following a disagreement with Bernard. From 1967 to 1968, he was the manager of the German team Preußen Münster, taking them to a 13th-place finish in the Regionalliga West, following which he had a short spell at Opel Rüsselsheim.|$|E
