25|$|Nitroglycerin, {{also known}} as <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> (GTN), is a {{medication}} used for heart failure, high blood pressure, and to treat and prevent chest pain from not enough {{blood flow to the}} heart (angina) or due to cocaine. This includes chest pain from a heart attack. It is taken by mouth, under the tongue, applied to the skin, or by injection into a vein.|$|E
25|$|The {{scope of}} {{practice}} of a German paramedic is not specifically {{defined by a}} decent law. Thus the allowed standard procedures largely depend on the local medical director and the employer. However, in life-threatening situations, a Rettungsassistent or Notfallsanitäter always has to perform autonomously first diagnosis/monitoring and all necessary ALS treatments until an emergency physician arrives. This includes airway management (clearing airway and oropharyngeal, subglottic and endotracheal intubation), intravenous cannulation and application of crystalloid solutions, basic medication (adrenaline, glucose, inhaled ß2 agonists/bronchodilators, rectal benzodiazepine, <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate,</b> analgetics) and resuscitation with an automated external defibrillator.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{arriving}} {{to the emergency}} department with a myocardial infarction (heart attack) {{are likely to be}} triaged to the resuscitation area. They will receive oxygen and monitoring and have an early ECG; aspirin will be given if not contraindicated or not already administered by the ambulance team; morphine or diamorphine will be given for pain; sub lingual (under the tongue) or buccal (between cheek and upper gum) <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> (nitroglycerin) (GTN or NTG) will be given, unless contraindicated by the presence of other drugs, such as drugs that treat erectile dysfunction.|$|E
2500|$|GTN {{is useful}} in {{decreasing}} angina attacks, perhaps more so than reversing angina once started, by supplementing blood concentrations of NO, also called endothelium-derived relaxing factor, before the structure of NO as the responsible agent was known. This {{led to the development}} of transdermal patches of <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate,</b> providing 24-hour release. However, the [...] effectiveness of <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> is limited by development of tolerance/tachyphylaxis within 2–3 weeks of sustained use. Continuous administration and absorption (such as provided by daily pills and especially skin patches) accelerate onset of tolerance and limit the usefulness of the agent. Thus, <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> works best when used only in short-term, pulse dosing. <b>Glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> is useful for acute myocardial infarction (heart attack) and pulmonary edema, again working best if used quickly, within a few minutes of symptom onset, as a pulse dose. It may also be given as a sublingual or buccal dose in the form of a tablet placed under the tongue or a spray into the mouth for the treatment of an angina attack.|$|E
2500|$|If the ECG {{does not}} show typical changes, the term [...] "non-ST segment {{elevation}} ACS" [...] is applied.

The accepted management of unstable angina and acute coronary syndrome is therefore empirical treatment with aspirin, a second platelet inhibitor such as clopidogrel, prasugrel or ticagrelor, and heparin (usually a low-molecular weight heparin), with intravenous <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> and opioids if the pain persists.

50|$|William Murrell (1853-1912) was an English physician, {{clinical}} pharmacologist, and toxicologist. Murrell is {{best known}} for being {{one of the first to}} recognize the clinical benefits of <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> (also known as nitroglycerin) for the management of patients with angina pectoris.|$|E
50|$|Like {{nitroglycerin}} (<b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate)</b> {{and other}} nitrates, PETN {{is also used}} medically as a vasodilator {{in the treatment of}} heart conditions. These drugs work by releasing the signaling gas nitric oxide in the body. The heart medicine Lentonitrat is nearly pure PETN.|$|E
50|$|Anginal pain is {{not usually}} sharp or {{stabbing}} or influenced by respiration. Antacids and simple analgesics do not usually relieve the pain. If chest discomfort (of whatever site) is precipitated by exertion, relieved by rest, and relieved by <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate,</b> the likelihood of angina is increased.|$|E
50|$|Nitrovasodilators are {{contraindicated}} under {{circumstances where}} lowering of blood pressure can be dangerous. This includes, with some variation {{between the individual}} substances, severe hypotension (low blood pressure), shock including cardiogenic shock, and anaemia. Whether a specific drug is useful or harmful under heart failure and myocardial infarction depends on its speed of action: Fast acting substances such as <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> and nitroprusside can be helpful for controlling blood pressure and consequently the amount of blood the heart has to pump, if the application is monitored continuously. Slow acting substances would hold the danger of ischaemia due to an uncontrollably low blood pressure and are therefore contraindicated. Depending on the circumstances, even fast acting substances can be contraindicated - for example, <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> in patients with obstructive heart failure.|$|E
50|$|The nitrates {{are used}} for the {{treatment}} and prevention of angina and acute myocardial infarction, while molsidomine acts too slowly to be useful {{for the treatment of}} acute angina. For quick action in the treatment of angina, <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> is used in form of a sublingual spray (nitro spray) or as soft capsules to be crunched.|$|E
5000|$|Since {{people who}} have taken tadalafil within the past 48 hours cannot take organic nitrates to relieve angina (such as <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> spray), these {{patients}} should seek immediate medical attention if they experience anginal chest pain. [...] In {{the event of a}} medical emergency, paramedics and medical personnel should be notified of any recent doses of tadalafil.|$|E
50|$|Acute {{cardiogenic}} {{pulmonary edema}} often responds rapidly to medical treatment. Positioning upright may relieve symptoms. Loop diuretics such as furosemide or bumetanide are administered, often together with morphine or diamorphine to reduce respiratory distress. Both diuretics and morphine may have vasodilator effects, but specific vasodilators {{may be used}} (particularly intravenous <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> or ISDN) provided the blood pressure is adequate.|$|E
50|$|Nitroglycerin, {{also known}} as <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> (GTN) is a {{medication}} used for heart failure, high blood pressure, and to treat and prevent chest pain from not enough {{blood flow to the}} heart or due to cocaine.

50|$|ACPs are {{competent}} in many emergency medical skills, including airway management (oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal airway, oropharyngeal suctioning, laryngoscopy and Magill's forceps, laryngeal mask airway, intermittent positive pressure ventilation), cardiac management (cardiac monitoring - basic ECG interpretation and 12-lead ECG, manual defibrillation), drug/fluid administration (intramuscular injection, intravenous cannulation, fluid replacement), {{and the administration}} of basic and advanced drugs (aspirin, glucose, <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate,</b> adrenaline, morphine etc.).|$|E
5000|$|Nitric oxide (NO) {{also appears}} {{to play a role}} in tendon healing and {{inhibition}} of its synthesis impairs tendon healing. [...] The use of a nitric oxide delivery system (<b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> patches) applied over the area of maximal tenderness was tested in three clinical trials for the treatment of tendinopathies and was found to significantly reduce pain and increase range of motion and strength.|$|E
50|$|Lateral {{internal}} sphincterotomy is {{the preferred}} method of surgery for persons with chronic anal fissures, and is generally used when medical therapy has failed. It {{is associated with a}} lower rate of side effects than older techniques such as posterior internal sphincterotomy and anoplasty, and has also been shown to be superior to topical <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> (GTN 0.2% ointment) in long term healing of fissures, with no difference in fecal continence.|$|E
50|$|Certified {{personnel}} {{traveling by}} commercial aircraft {{may be able}} to assist an MI patient by using the on-board first aid kit, which may contain some cardiac drugs (such as <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> spray, aspirin, or opioid painkillers), an AED, and oxygen. Pilots may divert the flight to land at a nearby airport. Cardiac monitors are being introduced by some airlines, and they can be used by both on-board and ground-based physicians.|$|E
50|$|EGDN {{was used}} in {{manufacturing}} explosives to lower the freezing point of nitroglycerin, {{in order to produce}} dynamite for use in colder weather. Due to its volatility it was used as a detection taggant in some plastic explosives, e.g. Semtex, to allow more reliable explosive detection, until 1995 when it was replaced by dimethyldinitrobutane. It is considerably more stable than <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> owing to the lack of secondary hydroxyl groups in the precursor polyol.|$|E
50|$|Nitrates mainly {{differ in}} speed and {{duration}} of their action. <b>Glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> acts fast and short (10 to 30 minutes), while most other nitrates have a slower onset of action, but are effective {{for up to six}} hours. Molsidomine, as has been mentioned, not only acts slowly but also differs from the nitrates in exhibiting no tolerance. Nitroprusside, given intravenously, acts immediately, and after stopping the infusion blood pressure returns to its previous level within ten minutes.|$|E
5000|$|Excisional hemorrhoidectomy is a {{surgical}} excision of the hemorrhoid used primarily only in severe cases. It {{is associated with}} significant postoperative pain and usually requires 2-4 weeks for recovery. However, the long-term benefit is greater in those with grade 3 hemorrhoids as compared to rubber band ligation. It is the recommended treatment in those with a thrombosed external hemorrhoid if carried out within 24-72 hours. <b>Glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> ointment after the procedure helps both with pain and healing.|$|E
50|$|Glycerol is used {{to produce}} nitroglycerin, which is an {{essential}} ingredient of various explosives such as dynamite, gelignite, and propellants like cordite. Reliance on soap-making to supply co-product glycerol {{made it difficult to}} increase production to meet wartime demand. Hence, synthetic glycerol processes were national defense priorities {{in the days leading up}} to World War II. Nitroglycerin, also known as <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> (GTN) is commonly used to relieve angina pectoris, taken in the form of sub-lingual tablets, or as an aerosol spray.|$|E
5000|$|Sublabial administration, {{literally}} [...] "under the lip", from Latin, {{refers to}} the pharmacological route of administration by which the active substance is placed between the lip and the gingiva (gum). Sublabial administration {{should not be confused}} with sublingual administration, which is under the tongue. The frenulum of the tongue may be irritated when in contact with corrosive materials but can be avoided with this route. It is usually used for medications such as <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate,</b> for example, in angina pectoris.|$|E

50|$|Research has {{revealed}} that nitric oxide (NO) and calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) do have roles in the pathogenesis of a migraine without aura attack. Several {{studies have shown that}} migraines without aura develop in most subjects after the infusion of <b>glyceryl</b> <b>trinitrate</b> (GTN, well known as nitroglycerin), which is known to transport NO to tissues, but only in patients who are migraine sufferers. As well, inhibition of the nitric oxide synthase enzymes (NOS) by L-nitromonomethylarginine (L-NMMA) successfully reduced pain severity (in contrast with a placebo) in spontaneous attacks of migraine without aura.|$|E
50|$|Patients {{arriving}} {{to the emergency}} department with a myocardial infarction (heart attack) {{are likely to be}} triaged to the resuscitation area.
