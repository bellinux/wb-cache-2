The pilgrimage sites, {{important}} for both Christians and Jews have shifted place during history. The site of Al-Maghtas (baptism, or immersion in Arabic) on the East side of the River in Jordan has been deemed the earliest place of worship. This site was found following UNESCO-sponsored excavations. Al-Maghtas was visited by Pope John Paul II in March 2000, and he said: [...] "In my mind I see Jesus coming to {{the waters of the}} river Jordan not <b>far</b> <b>from</b> <b>here</b> to be baptized by John the Baptist". The Muslim conquest {{put an end to the}} Byzantine buildings on the east bank of the Jordan River, the later reverence took place just across the river in the West Bank at Qasr el Yahud.|$|E
