5|$|Aquatic {{invertebrates}} {{have been}} recognized as an <b>integral</b> <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the river otter's diet.

Invertebrates discovered within scats or digestive tracts could most likely be a secondary food item, first being consumed by the fish that are subsequently preyed upon by the otters.|$|E
