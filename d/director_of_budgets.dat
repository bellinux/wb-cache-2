40|$|The road to Dr. Schoen’s {{achievements}} is described. She {{was always}} willing to try new activities and to accept new challenges. Her parents provided many educational opportunities. She married after her third year of college and lived many places in the U. S. while her husband was in the Army. As a teacher in many schools, she had to learn new subject matter and to teach students of different cultures. At the age of 39, she was encouraged to pursue the Ph. D. degree in the College of Education. Dr. Schoen describes the challenges of leaving the Department of Speech to become Assistant Director to the School of Allied Medical Professions. She {{was a member of}} the pioneer group that established many allied health programs. During the student unrest of the Vietnam War, the ineffectiveness of the administration is described. She worked with women, assisting them in diffusing their anger. Later, she was chair of a University Committee to assess the status of women at OSU. As Associate Provost, she assisted colleges and departments in establishing written guidelines for promotion, tenure, grades and so forth. 	As a member of the American Council on Education, she helped develop a list of women who should be considered for higher level administrative positions in universities. Dr. Enarson was a supporter of the project and named Dr. Schoen as Vice President for Educational Services in 1978. As she was planning to retire in 1983, she was asked to assist the School of Nursing to become the College of Nursing. She was the first non-nurse to become Dean. The administrative styles of Presidents Fawcett, Enarson and Jennings are summarized. 	She hopes the Kathryn T. Schoen Endowment Fund will open more doors for deserving women.
