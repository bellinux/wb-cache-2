5|$|Environmental concerns. In {{addition}} to concerns about {{air and water}} pollution, Norwegian architectural design has also emphasized integration with the natural landscape. More recently, architects have also worked with <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> make {{the most out of}} scarce resources, e.g., energy, water, etc.|$|E
5|$|Hoover trained its <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> produce C5s {{and tested}} its {{manufacturing}} processes by assembling, dismantling and re-assembling 100 C5s. Full production began in November 1984 and by early January 1985 over 2,500 C5s had been manufactured. Each production line could produce 50 vehicles an hour, and Hoover {{were capable of}} producing up to 8,000 C5s per week.|$|E
5|$|In {{analysing}} {{systems such}} as urban and national parks, dams, farms and gardens, theme parks, open-pit mines, water catchments, one {{way to look at}} the relationship between sustainability and resiliency is to view the former with a long-term vision and resiliency as the capacity of human <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> respond to immediate environmental events.|$|E

25|$|While most {{crops are}} <b>engineered</b> <b>to</b> resist insects or {{tolerate}} herbicides some crops {{have been developed}} for other traits. Flowers have been <b>engineered</b> <b>to</b> display colours that they cannot do so naturally (in particular the blue color in roses). A few crops, like the genetically modified papaya, are <b>engineered</b> <b>to</b> resist viruses. Other modifications alter the plants composition, with the aim of making it more nutritious, longer lasting or more industrially useful. Recently crops <b>engineered</b> <b>to</b> tolerate drought have been commercialised.|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{discovery}} and management {{is the use}} of known data to come to some new conclusion[1]. Our group is writing a system which will allow an <b>engineer</b> <b>to</b> diagnose errors and problems in a telecommunications system using knowledge management and discovery techniques. The system will allow the <b>engineer</b> <b>to</b> give feedback on it's diagnoses, and allow the <b>engineer</b> <b>to</b> refine the diagnostic flowchart to make it more accurate in it's future predictions...|$|R
5|$|Service roads allowed <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> {{separate}} local access {{from the}} highway and avoid space-consuming interchanges in many places. As such, interchanges were only opened at Bronte Road (then Highway25), Kerr Street, Royal Windsor Drive (then Highway122), Erin Mills Parkway, Mississauga Road, Hurontario Street (then Highway10), Cawthra Road, Dixie Road, and Highway27.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{contracts}} for SIM Lite were awarded in 1998, totaling US$200million. Work on the SIM project required scientists and <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> move through eight specific new technology milestones, and by November 2006, all eight had been completed.|$|E

5|$|Apple {{approached}} Sony in late 1989 {{because it}} did not have enough <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> handle the number of new products that were planned for delivery in 1991. Using a basic blueprint from Apple, including a list of chips and other components, and the Portable's architecture, the 100 was miniaturized and manufactured by Sony in San Diego, California, and Japan. Sony engineers had little experience building personal computers but nonetheless completed Apple's smallest and lightest machine in under 13months, cancelling other projects and giving the PowerBook100 top priority. Sony president Norio Ohga gave project manager Kihey Yamamoto permission to recruit engineers from any Sony division.|$|E
5|$|Experimental {{pop music}} {{developed}} concurrently with experimental jazz {{as a new}} kind of avant-garde, with many younger musicians embracing the practice of making studio recordings along the fringes of popular music. In the early 1960s, it was common for producers, songwriters, and <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> freely experiment with musical form, orchestration, unnatural reverb, and other sound effects, and by the late 1960s, highly experimental pop music, or sounds that expanded the idea of the typical popular song, was positively received by young audiences. Throughout the ensuing decades, some purveyors of the style shared a literary-experimental tradition that balanced experimentation with populist cohesion.|$|E
5|$|In October 2008, the brigade's leaders {{attended}} a conference at Joint Base Balad. Hosted by the 3rd Sustainment Command (Expeditionary), {{the conference was}} attended by the 1st, 7th, 16th, 55th, and 371st Sustainment Brigades, {{as well as the}} 76th Infantry Brigade Combat Team. They discussed streamlining and coordinating sustainment throughout the region. Among the brigade's operations was a water project in the Ninewa province. The brigade operated with US Air Force and Iraqi Army <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> repair infrastructure that brought water from the Tigris River to the entire province, including the base. The brigade has also undertaken several other support duties for units operating throughout northern Iraq.|$|E

5|$|In {{two weeks}} of {{fighting}} {{in and around the}} fortress, the North Koreans were able to gradually push back the UN forces from Ka-san and Hills 755 and 314 to the south, but the UN forces held out strongly and the North Koreans were not able to quickly consolidate their gains. The UN forces defended the ground tenaciously, even assigning a battalion of <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> fight on the front lines, eventually preventing the North Koreans from advancing long enough for a UN counterattack at Inchon which drove the North Koreans from the area.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period that the MTO {{undertook}} an engineering review of the entire route in search of cost inefficiencies. Highways 416 and 407 were constructed during a recession in the mid-1990s. Highway407 became a tolled highway {{and for a time}} it was mentioned in legislative debates that Highway416 would also be tolled, but ultimately this never happened. Instead, a hiatus in construction allowed <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> evaluate inefficiencies in bridge and cross-section designs, as well as sensitive clay soils near Ottawa. This initiative led to a cost savings of over C$7 million and several of the unique design features located {{along the length of the}} freeway.|$|E
5|$|JAL Flight Academy (JFA) was {{established}} by Japan Airlines (JAL) in August 1989, as a flight training school subsidiary based at Omura Airport, Nagasaki. It provided conversion training for its flight <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> become pilots. In April 1991, a new division of JFA was created to operate scheduled services to succeed the troubled Nishi Seto Airlink services, a commuter airline serving cities in western Japan. Since {{the introduction of the}} 19-seats Jetstream 31s (JS31) in September 1991, the aircraft progressively replaced the Embraer EMB 110 Bandeirante inherited from Nishi Seto.|$|E

5|$|North American shipped {{spacecraft}} CM-012 to Kennedy Space Center on August 26, 1966 under a conditional Certificate of Flight Worthiness: 113 significant incomplete planned engineering changes had to {{be completed}} at KSC. But that was not all; an additional 623 engineering change orders were made and completed after delivery. Grissom became so frustrated with {{the inability of the}} training simulator <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> keep up with the spacecraft changes, that he took a lemon from a tree by his house and hung it on the simulator.|$|E
5|$|On 17 December, Div Cav {{guarded the}} {{northern}} {{flank of the}} brigade in its advance on Nofilia; B and C Squadrons engaged the German rearguard, knocking out one Panzer III and losing two carriers. The brigade failed to capture Nofilia; although it cut the road, the Germans escaped during the night. The regiment was scheduled to camp at Nofilia for a week, with C Squadron dispatched to guard the airfield at Sultan with a detachment of <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> clear mines. The minefield was cleared by 23 December, when A Squadron replaced C Squadron. In late December, 18 new carriers arrived and the regiment prepared for another advance.|$|E
5|$|Pat Nixon had an {{interest}} in adding artifacts to the Executive Mansion, and built on Jacqueline Kennedy's more publicized efforts. She added more than 600 paintings and furnishings to the White House and its collections, the largest number of acquisitions by any administration. She created the Map Room and renovated the China room, and refurbished nine others. She worked with <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> develop an exterior lighting system for the entire White House, literally making it glow a soft white. She ordered the flag flown, day and night, even when the president was not there.|$|E

5|$|Structural {{coloration}} {{could be}} exploited industrially and commercially, and research {{that could lead}} to such applications is under way. A direct parallel would be to create active or adaptive military camouflage fabrics that vary their colours and patterns to match their environments, just as chameleons and cephalopods do. The ability to vary reflectivity to different wavelengths of light could also lead to efficient optical switches that could function like transistors, enabling <b>engineers</b> <b>to</b> make fast optical computers and routers.|$|E
