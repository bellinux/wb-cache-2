25|$|In {{the iron}} lung {{by means of}} a pump, the air is {{withdrawn}} mechanically to produce a vacuum inside the tank, thus creating negative pressure. This negative pressure leads to expansion of the chest, which causes a decrease in intrapulmonary pressure, and increases flow of ambient air into the lungs. As the vacuum is released, the pressure inside the tank equalizes to that of the ambient pressure, and the <b>elastic</b> <b>coil</b> of the chest and lungs leads to passive exhalation. However, when the vacuum is created, the abdomen also expands along with the lung, cutting off venous flow back to the heart, leading to pooling of venous blood in the lower extremities. There are large portholes for nurse or home assistant access. The patients can talk and eat normally, and can see the world through a well-placed series of mirrors. Some could remain in these iron lungs for years at a time quite successfully.|$|E

40|$|This {{article is}} devoted to the {{stabilization}} of the segway model in the form of mechanical model. Model consists of a wheel with two-link inverted pendulum which is attached to the mechanism by a hinge. Connections between the links are tied by <b>elastic</b> <b>coiling</b> spring. The mechanism is driven by electromotor which rotates the wheels of the segway. Segway can be moved or rolled over the surface {{with the help of the}} same driver. The control parameters are the voltage of bounded source and the elastic coefficient of the coiling spring. Stabilization of region of attraction of the pendulum vertical position is controlled by manipulating the voltage and the elastic coefficient of the coiling spring. The aim of the research is to investigate effect of flexible body of the monocycle model to the region of attraction of pendulum vertical position. The considered work has researched and analyzed the planar motion of an inverted flexible pendulum mounted on a pair of wheel. The maximal area of attraction of upright position was obtained...|$|R
40|$|The {{nature of}} {{physical}} processes can depend substantially on the dimensionality of a system. One such example are buckling instabilities, which {{arise from the}} competition between axial compression and bending in <b>elastic</b> filaments. Thus, <b>coiling</b> of a jet of viscous fluid falling on a substrate (honey poured on a toast) maha 1,griffiths behaves quite differently from the coiling of viscous sheets (volcanous lava sliding on a crust) johnson,ramberg.

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Space closure {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{challenging}} processes in Orthodontics and requires a solid comprehension of biomechanics in order to avoid undesirable side effects. Understanding the biomechanical basis of space closure better enables clinicians to determine anchorage and treatment options. In spite of the variety of appliance designs, space closure can be performed by means of friction or frictionless mechanics, and each technique has its advantages and disadvantages. Friction mechanics or sliding mechanics is attractive because of its simplicity; the space site is closed by means of <b>elastics</b> or <b>coil</b> springs to provide force, and the brackets slide on the orthodontic archwire. On the other hand, frictionless mechanics uses loop bends to generate force to close the space site, allowing differential moments in the active and reactive units, leading to a less or more anchorage control, depending on the situation. Objective: This article will discuss various theoretical aspects and methods of space closure based on biomechanical concepts...|$|R
40|$|The {{morphology}} of {{an elastic}} strip subject to vertical compressive stress on a frictional rigid substrate is investigated {{by a combination}} of theory and experiment. We find a rich variety of morphologies, which -when the bending elasticity dominates over the effect of gravity- are classified into three distinct types of states: pinned, partially slipped, and completely slipped, depending on the magnitude of the vertical strain and coefficient of static friction. We develop a theory of elastica under mixed clamped-hinged boundary conditions combined with the Coulomb-Amontons friction law, and find excellent quantitative agreement with simulations and controlled physical experiments. We also discuss the effect of gravity in order to bridge the difference in qualitative behaviors of stiff strips and flexible strings, or ropes. Our study thus complements recent work on <b>elastic</b> rope <b>coiling,</b> and takes a significant step towards establishing a unified understanding of how a thin elastic object interacts vertically with a solid surface.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{experimental}} {{investigation of the}} coiling of a filament of a yield stress fluid falling on a solid surface. We use two kinds of yield stress fluids, shaving foam and hair gel, and show that the coiling of the foam {{is similar to the}} <b>coiling</b> of an <b>elastic</b> rope. Two regimes of <b>coiling</b> (<b>elastic</b> and gravitational) are observed for the foam. Hair gel coiling, on the other hand, is more like the coiling of a liquid system; here we observe viscous and gravitational regimes. No inertial regime is observed for either system because of instabilities occurring at high flow rates or the breakup of the filament from large heights...|$|R
40|$|The tropoelastin monomer {{undergoes}} {{stages of}} association by coacervation, deposition onto microfibrils, and cross-linking to form elastic fibers. Tropoelastin {{consists of an}} <b>elastic</b> N-terminal <b>coil</b> region and a cell-interactive C-terminal foot region linked together by a highly exposed bridge region. The bridge region is conveniently positioned to modulate elastic fiber assembly through association by coacervation and its proximity to dominant cross-linking domains. Tropoelastin constructs that either modify or remove the entire bridge and downstream regions were assessed for elastogenesis. These constructs focused on a single alanine substitution (R 515 A) and a truncation (M 155 n) at the highly conserved arginine 515 site that borders the bridge. Each form displayed less efficient coacervation, impaired hydrogel formation, and decreased dermal fibroblast attachment compared to wild-type tropoelastin. The R 515 A mutant protein additionally showed reduced elastic fiber formation upon addition to human retinal pigmented epithelium cells and dermal fibroblasts. The small-angle X-ray scattering nanostructure of the R 515 A mutant protein revealed greater conformational flexibility around the bridge and C-terminal regions. This increased flexibility of the R 515 A mutant suggests that the tropoelastin R 515 residue stabilizes {{the structure of the}} bridge region, which is critical for elastic fiber assembly...|$|R
40|$|A {{finite element}} program is {{presented}} to simulate the process of packing and <b>coiling</b> <b>elastic</b> wires in two- and three-dimensional confining cavities. The wire is represented by third order beam elements and embedded into a corotational formulation to capture the geometric nonlinearity resulting from large rotations and deformations. The hyperbolic equations of motion are integrated in time using two different integration methods from the Newmark family: an implicit iterative Newton-Raphson line search solver, and an explicit predictor-corrector scheme, both with adaptive time stepping. These two approaches reveal fundamentally different suitability for the problem of strongly self-interacting bodies found in densely packed cavities. Generalizing the spherical confinement symmetry investigated in recent studies, the packing of a wire in hard ellipsoidal cavities is simulated in the frictionless elastic limit. Evidence is given that packings in oblate spheroids and scalene ellipsoids are energetically preferred to spheres. Comment: 17 pages, 7 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
40|$|An {{individual}} carbon nanocoil was {{clamped between}} two AFM cantilevers and loaded in tension {{to a maximum}} relative elongation of 42 %. The deformation of the nanocoil agrees well with an analytical model of the spring constant that accounts for the geometric nonlinearity. The nanocoil behaves like an elastic spring with a spring constant K of 0. 12 N/m in the low strain region. No plastic deformation was detected. High-resolution microscopy images and the electron energy loss spectrum (EELS) indicate that the nanocoils are amorphous with a sp 2 /sp 3 bonded-carbon ratio of 4 : 1. Carbon micro- and nanocoils have been synthesized and studied. 1 - 6 Because of their unique 3 D structure, they have potential applications as mechanical components such as resonating elements and nanosprings or as a novel reinforce-ment in high-strain composites. Other potential applications are as nanosolenoids and electromagnetic wave absorbers.

40|$|Background. Elastomeric {{chains and}} NiTi coil springs {{are two major}} {{traction}} aids in orthodontic tooth movements. Force degradation occurs over time in both groups, with higher percentages in elastic chains. The effects of environmental factors and some mouth rinses on this force decay have been previously studied. No study has been performed to evaluate the effect of current popular mouth rinses such as Orthokin, Sensikin and Persica on this force degradation. Methods. Forty pieces of elastic chains consisting of 5 loops (Ortho Technology, USA) and 40 NiTi closed coil springs (3 M Unitek, Germany) were divided into 4 groups: control (artificial saliva), Orthokin mouthwash, Sensikin mouthwash and Persica mouthwash. All the groups were kept in an incubator at 37 °C for 3 weeks. In the test groups, the samples were immersed in mouthwash twice a day. Force degradationwas measured at 5 time intervals: baseline, 1 hour, 24 hours, 1 week and 3 weeks, using a digital force gauge. Repeated-measures ANOVA and one-way ANOVA were used for statistical analysis. Results. Force decay occurred over time in both <b>elastic</b> chain and <b>coil</b> spring groups. In elastic chain group, after 3 weeks, Orthokin mouth rinse had significantly lower force degradation compared to other groups (P 0. 05). Conclusion. Based {{the results of this}} study, these three mouthwashes did not increase the force degradation of orthodontic traction aids under study...|$|R
40|$|A large {{adaptive}} {{deformable mirror}} with high actuator density is presented. The DM {{consists of a}} thin continuous membrane which acts as the correcting element. A grid of low voltage electro-magnetical push-pull actuators, - located in an actuator plate -, impose out-of-plane displacements in the mirror’s membrane. To provide a stable and stiff reference plane for the actuators, a mechanically stable and thermally decoupled honeycomb support structure is added. The design is suited for mirrors up to several hundred mm with an actuator pitch of a few mm. One of the key elements in the design is the actuator grid. Each actuator consists of a closed magnetic circuit in which a strong permanent magnet (PM) attracts a ferromagnetic core. Movement of this core is provided by a low stiffness <b>elastic</b> guiding. A <b>coil</b> surrounds the PM. Both the coil and the PM {{are connected to the}} fixed world. By applying a current through the coil, the magnetic force acting on the core can be influenced. This force variation will lead to translation of the ferromagnetic core. This movement is transferred to the reflective mirror surface in a piston-free manner. The design allows for a long total stroke and a large inter actuator stroke. The actuators are produced in arrays which make the design modular and easily extendable. The first actuators and an actuator grid are produced and tested in a dedicated test set-up. This paper describes how relevant actuator properties, such as stiffness and efficiency, can be influenced by the design. The power dissipation in the actuator grid is optimized to a few milliwatts per actuator, thereby avoiding active cooling...|$|R
