5|$|Augustus' public revenue reforms had a {{great impact}} on the {{subsequent}} success of the Empire. Augustus brought a far greater portion of the Empire's expanded land base under consistent, <b>direct</b> <b>taxation</b> from Rome, instead of exacting varying, intermittent, and somewhat arbitrary tributes from each local province as Augustus' predecessors had done. This reform greatly increased Rome's net revenue from its territorial acquisitions, stabilized its flow, and regularized the financial relationship between Rome and the provinces, rather than provoking fresh resentments with each new arbitrary exaction of tribute.|$|E

Although Ireland was overwhelmingly Roman Catholic, the Protestant Church remained the established church and was funded by <b>direct</b> <b>taxation,</b> which was greatly resented by the Catholic majority. An initial attempt by Disraeli to negotiate with Archbishop Manning {{the establishment of a}} Roman Catholic university in Dublin foundered in March when Gladstone moved resolutions to disestablish the Irish Church altogether. The proposal united the Liberals under Gladstone's leadership, while causing divisions among the Conservatives.|$|E

Many Anti-Federalists, in contrast, now opposed it, realizing that the Bill's adoption would greatly lessen the chances of a second constitutional convention, which they desired.

He appointed himself as Treasurer, {{and in this}} capacity he implemented new land and income taxes, {{similar to that of}} the taxes introduced under Grey, though more radical. Several other notable pieces of legislation were passed by Ballance in this period, such as the Land Act 1892 and the Land for Settlements Act 1892. Despite initial outcry, the tax was seen as equitable by the people, who eventually found themselves better off as a result of such a great decrease in <b>direct</b> <b>taxations.</b>|$|R

The agreement called for the implementation of Palestinian self-rule in portions of the West Bank and Gaza Strip over a five-year period, along with an immediate halt to and gradual removal of Israeli settlements in those areas. The accords called for a Palestinian police force to be formed from local recruits and Palestinians abroad, to patrol areas of self-rule. Authority over the various fields of rule, including education and culture, social welfare, <b>direct</b> <b>taxation</b> and tourism, would be transferred to the Palestinian interim government. Both parties agreed also on forming a committee that would establish cooperation and coordination dealing with specific economic sectors, including utilities, industry, trade and communication.|$|E

The removal of the customs wall allowed its former route to be turned into yet another road running through Potsdamer Platz, thus increasing still further the amount of traffic passing through.

The struggles in the Republic between the Unitaires and the Federalists caused anti-French unrest to break out in the Leventina — the most northerly part of the canton — in 1799, which led to secessionist moves, with many in the area wanting to join with nearby Uri, then within the Helvetic canton of Waldstätten.|$|E

Edmund Barton and other well-known protectionists lost their seats, Labor was reduced from 30 to 18, and Reid formed his first cabinet. One of his earliest measures was a new lands bill which provided for the division of pastoral leases into two halves, one of which was to be open to the free selector, while the pastoral lessee got some security of tenure for the other half. Classification of crown lands according to their value was provided for, and the free selector, or his transferee, had to reside on the property.|$|E
25|$|In 1913, five {{additional}} wage boards {{were set}} up that covered hollow ware making, shirt making, sugar confectionery and food preserving, tin box making, and linen and cotton embroidery, along with {{a portion of the}} laundry industry. These extensions led to an additional 140,000 being covered by minimum wage legislation. The Public Health (Prevention and Treatment of Disease) Act 1913 empowered local authorities to formulate tuberculosis schemes, while a Trade Union passed that same year clarified the legal position of trade unions while also restoring their political power, together with the financial position of the Labour Party. In 1914, Local Authorities received grants from the government to provide maternal and child welfare services. while the Criminal Justice Administration Act passed that same year compelled magistrates to allow for sufficient time to be made for paying fines. As noted by the historian C. P. Hill, this legislation was both merciful and economical, as it helped to reduce the prison population. The budget of 1914 brought greater progressivity into the taxation system by increasing levels of <b>direct</b> <b>taxation</b> on the wealthy while also investing more money in social services. The educational grant was increased, with money allocated towards the training of specialist teachers, schools for the deformed, grants for open-air schools for victims of tuberculosis, and further state provision for school-meal services. In addition, new provisions for maternity centres, sanitoria, and ancillary health services under the 1911 insurance bill were introduced, together with £4million in loans for local authority house-building.|$|E

40|$|The {{impact of}} fiscal {{activity}} on human capital formation {{has often been}} analyzed {{with regard to the}} expenditure side of the budget, i. e. the subsidization of (higher) education. Recent contributions have increasingly focused on the effect of taxation on human capital accumulation. Less attention is given to the simultaneous effect of both subsidization and taxation on human capital accumulation. Since subsidies to higher education may offset the distortionary effects of taxation, the paper aims to analyze the amount of subsidization which is necessary to counteract the discouraging effect of various kinds of taxation (i. e., proportional, <b>direct,</b> indirect <b>taxation</b> and a combination of both <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>taxation)</b> on human capital, measured as the graduation rates. Furthermore, the effect of externalities from higher education on the optimal amount shall be analyzed as well as the role of <b>taxation</b> if <b>direct</b> costs of higher education are completely born by the state.

500|$|A large {{fiscal deficit}} had arisen in the reigns of Elizabeth I and James I.

His most loyal friends were the Calvinists at Utrecht and Friesland, provinces in constant opposition to Holland and Zeeland. Those rich provinces engaged in a lucrative trade with Spain which was very helpful to either side's war effort. On Elizabeth's orders Leicester enforced a ban on this trade with the enemy, thus alienating the wealthy Dutch merchants. He also effected a fiscal reform. In order to centralise finances and to replace the highly corrupt tax farming with <b>direct</b> <b>taxation,</b> a new Council of Finances was established which was not under supervision of the Council of State. The Dutch members of the Council of State were outraged at these bold steps. English peace talks with Spain behind Leicester's back, which had started within days after he had left England, undermined his position further.|$|E
500|$|Royal {{revenue streams}} still proved {{insufficient}} {{and from the}} middle of the 13th century there was a shift away from the earlier land-based tax system towards one based on a mixture of indirect and <b>direct</b> <b>taxation.</b> At the same time, HenryIII had introduced the practice of consulting with leading nobles on tax issues, leading to the system whereby the Parliament of England agreed on new taxes when required. In 1275, the [...] "Great and Ancient Custom" [...] began to tax woollen products and hides, with the Great Charter of 1303 imposing additional levies on foreign merchants in England, with the poundage tax introduced in 1347. In 1340, the discredited tallage tax system was finally abolished by EdwardIII. Assessing the total impact of changes to royal revenues between 1086 and 1290 is difficult. At best, EdwardI was struggling in 1300 to match in real terms the revenues that HenryII had enjoyed in 1100, and considering the growth in the size of the English economy, the king's share of the national income had dropped considerably.|$|E

40|$|Through this study, {{we try to}} {{evaluate}} the effects that the <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>taxation</b> and the subsidies provided by the Government have on income inequality. We use Gini coefficient {{as a measure of}} inequality and use annual data for Indian economy for years 1982 - 2015 and employ an ARDL-based bounds test approach for testing co-integration. We ascertain the stationarity properties for all the series, separately using the ADF test, the DF-GLS test and the KPSS test. We estimate the long-run and short-run coefficients and find that a long-run negative relationship exists between Gini coefficient and subsidy-related expenditure. The long-run coefficients of <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>taxation</b> terms are positive but are significant only at 10 %. The short-run coefficients obtained from ECM show that a negative relationship exists between expenditure on subsidies and Gini coefficient. In short run, direct tax seems to have an insignificant positive coefficient while indirect tax seems to have a significant unbalancing effect. We employ the Granger causality tests to confirm direction of causality and find that there runs a unidirectional causality from direct tax, indirect tax and subsidy to Gini coefficient, while any causality from Gini to any series is largely insignificant. The results imply that the government should use the calculated hybrid of tools like <b>direct</b> and indirect <b>taxation</b> and subsidies to have an equalizing impact on the economy. Moreover, the significant causal relationship from subsidies to Gini opens up an opportunity for the government to improve the income distribution using targeted subsidies, for example the Aadhaar-linked Direct Transfer Benefits etc...|$|R
