40|$|How many <b>directorships</b> are too many? Globally, {{normative}} advice emphasises {{the importance}} of {{limiting the number of}} <b>directorships</b> any individual should hold due to the workloads they entail. However, there is little empirical evidence to support this view. Rather, there is a strong tradition of supporting multiple <b>directorships</b> as a mechanism for the firm to co-opt external resources. To explore the issue of director workloads and multiple <b>directorships,</b> we first consider the issues related to multiple <b>directorships</b> and outline the conclusions of extant international and Australian studies into multiple <b>directorships.</b> We then detail our objectives in undertaking this research and our approach to data collection.

The main source of data have been the announcements that are to be published by corporations regularly in a journal called Business and Court Gazette (bcg).

40|$|The {{link between}} CEO quality and outside <b>directorships</b> is first investigated.

40|$|This paper {{extends the}} {{literature}} on multiple <b>directorships,</b> busy directors and firm performance by providing evidence from an emerging economy, India, where the incidence of multiple <b>directorships</b> is high. Using a sample of 500 large firms and a measure of "busyness" that is more general in its applicability, we find multiple <b>directorships</b> by independent directors to correlate positively with firm value. Independent directors with multiple positions are also found to attend more board meetings {{and are more likely}} to be present in a company's annual general meeting. These findings are largely in contrast to the existing evidence from the US studies and lend support to the "quality hypothesis" that busy outside directors are likely to be better directors, and the "resource dependency hypothesis" that multiple directors may be better networked thereby helping the company to establish more linkages with its external environment. Multiple <b>directorships</b> by inside directors are, however, negatively related to firm performance. Our results suggest that the institutional specificities of emerging economies like India could work in favor of sustaining high levels of multiple <b>directorships</b> for independent directors without necessarily impairing the quality of corporate governance.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{includes two}} related chapters that investigate {{the value of}} multiple <b>directorships.</b> In the first chapter, I focus on potential tradeoffs between {{the costs and benefits}} of multiple <b>directorships</b> held by outside directors and attempt to determine how firm characteristics affect such tradeoffs. It is widely believed that outside directors of a firm play important functions of monitoring and advising. As a result, the basic hypothesis of the first essay is that multiple <b>directorships</b> by outside directors can have different implications for firms that have different levels of monitoring and advising needs. Consistent with this hypothesis, the evidence suggests that firm performance is positively associated with multiple <b>directorships</b> for firms with high growth opportunities and low agency conflicts. Such firms would benefit more from better advising while not suffering much from less monitoring. Likewise, firm performance is negatively associated with multiple <b>directorships</b> for firms with low growth opportunities and high agency conflicts. In the second essay, I examine how multiple <b>directorships</b> held by outside directors affect shareholder wealth during acquisitions. The evidence indicates that not all busy outside directors have the same effect and some types of busy outside directors may benefit the firms...|$|R
