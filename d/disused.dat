5|$|In 2015, {{a scheme}} was {{proposed}} by the design firm Gensler to convert <b>disused</b> London Underground tunnels into subterranean rail trails, enabling the <b>disused</b> branches of the Piccadilly line and Jubilee line {{to be used as}} cycle paths. The scheme, which would involve re-opening Aldwych station as an access point for cyclists, has not been officially approved.|$|E
5|$|Around {{the island}} there are failed or {{abandoned}} ventures, the relics {{of which are}} still there; a piggery, chicken farm, <b>disused</b> stockyards, market garden and a joinery works.|$|E
5|$|As {{part of the}} {{clean-up}} it {{was proposed}} to line the two <b>disused</b> graving docks with an impervious synthetic membrane and fill them with the contaminated soil.|$|E

5|$|As {{the castle}} was <b>disused</b> from the mid-15th century it fell into dilapidation, and {{antiquarian}} depictions from the 18th century show Gleaston {{in a state}} of ruin. Though it is not open to the public, it {{has been the subject of}} historical and archaeological investigation in the 20th and 21st centuries.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the <b>disused</b> eastern {{trackbed}} {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had acquired a bad reputation due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs on the station premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the <b>disused</b> trackbed by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks dug out during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a general improvement of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy.|$|E
5|$|Cromer High {{station was}} {{situated}} {{a short distance}} away from the Cromer Tunnel, Norfolk's only standard gauge railway tunnel, connecting the Sheringham and Mundesley lines. Although <b>disused</b> since services ceased in 1953, the tunnel remains intact.|$|E
5|$|Down Street, {{also known}} as Down Street (Mayfair), is a <b>disused</b> station on the London Underground, located in Mayfair, west London. It was opened in 1907 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway. It was latterly served by the Piccadilly line and was {{situated}} between Dover Street (now named Green Park) and Hyde Park Corner stations.|$|E
5|$|During World War II, the <b>disused</b> tunnels between Borough and King William Street {{stations}} were converted {{for use as}} an air-raid shelter, with entrances to the shelter at King William Street and at six sites south of the Thames (of nine planned). In the 1960s the <b>disused</b> tunnels were used to assist the ventilation of London Bridge station and all the entrances bar that at 9 London Bridge Street were infilled with concrete. It is now only possible to access the tunnels from Three Castles House or a passage from the Jubilee line at London Bridge. Most of the C's six original station buildings were rebuilt or modified during the improvements to {{the line in the}} 1920s or during more recent modernisations. Only the building at Kennington retains its original exterior and the dome over the lift shaft, a feature of all the original stations.|$|E
5|$|During these {{formative}} years, Chippendale and his freshman-year college roommate Matt Brinkman {{began to}} set up Fort Thunder, a <b>disused</b> warehouse space in the Olneyville district of Providence.

5|$|Located at the {{junction}} of two earlier tube railway schemes, the station was opened in 1906 by the Great Northern, Piccadilly and Brompton Railway (GNP). The station entrances and below ground circulation were largely reconstructed for the introduction of escalators {{and the opening of}} Central line platforms in 1933, making the station the only interchange between the lines. Before 1994, Holborn was the northern terminus of the short and little-frequented Piccadilly line branch to Aldwych and two platforms originally used for this service are <b>disused.</b> One of the <b>disused</b> platforms has been used for location filming when a London Underground station platform is needed.|$|E
5|$|Midsomer Norton {{traditionally}} hosted {{other industries}} {{and became a}} major manufacturing centre for printing and packaging. Some 2,000 people (27% of total employment) work in this industry locally. Following the decline of mining, these companies expanded on local trading estates and in Welton. The sites of the <b>disused</b> collieries in the area have subsequently been developed for light industry.|$|E
5|$|Moonrise {{takes place}} in several {{locations}} inspired by similar locales in the United Kingdom. With {{the exception of a}} <b>disused</b> mine, the forest in which the cats live is based largely on the New Forest. In addition, parts of the story take place by the ocean and in a fictitious mountain range.|$|E
5|$|One of the {{constant}} difficulties of London orchestras {{was the lack of}} good rehearsal space and facilities. In 1973, acting jointly with the LSO, the LPO acquired and began restoring a <b>disused</b> church in Southwark, converting it into the Henry Wood Hall, a convenient and acoustically excellent rehearsal space and recording studio, opened in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Proposals {{had existed}} since the 1980s to re-open the <b>disused</b> railway line which passes through Didsbury {{as part of}} the Manchester Metrolink light rail system. Under these proposals, Didsbury Station was to re-open under the name of Didsbury Central or Didsbury Village.|$|E
5|$|Tarka Trail. Between Ilfracombe and Bideford, {{the path}} mostly follows a coastal {{section of the}} Tarka Trail. For part of this route, the paths follow the course of <b>disused</b> railway lines: the Ilfracombe Branch Line, between Braunton and Barnstaple, and the Bideford Branch Line, between Barnstaple and Bideford.|$|E
5|$|The 3rd person {{singular}} and plural nominative forms, ngonggega and bogo, {{are labeled}} 'rare' {{because they are}} gradually becoming <b>disused.</b> Speakers prefer to use non-personal pronouns such as gayh- 'that' or gayh-gorden 'those'. Moreover, since the person and number of the subject is contained in the prefix of the verb, nominative free pronouns are often dropped.|$|E
5|$|The Finnieston Crane or Stobcross Crane is a <b>disused</b> giant {{cantilever}} crane (Hammerhead crane) in {{the centre of}} Glasgow, Scotland. It {{is no longer in}} working order, but is retained {{as a symbol of the}} city's engineering heritage. The crane was used for loading cargo, in particular steam locomotives, onto ships to be exported around the world.|$|E
5|$|The <b>disused</b> station building's bricked-up {{windows and}} doors feature artwork of animals created by {{students}} at Redland Green School, and promote links with nearby Bristol Zoo.

5|$|The lack of good {{rehearsal}} {{facilities to}} which Bernstein had objected was {{addressed in the}} 1970s when, jointly with the LPO, the LSO acquired and restored a <b>disused</b> church in Southwark, converting it into the Henry Wood Hall, a convenient and acoustically excellent rehearsal space and recording studio, opened in 1975.|$|E
5|$|Waddesdon Manor was {{complete}} in 1889, 13 years after construction began. The Winchendon Branch {{closed and the}} track was removed. The gasworks remained operational, although supplied by road, until its closure during the coal shortage of 1916. It was demolished shortly afterwards. The track of the <b>disused</b> siding remained until at least 1916.|$|E
5|$|A <b>disused</b> quarry at East Kirkton in the Bathgate Hills is the {{location}} where the Carboniferous fossil of Westlothiana lizziae (aka 'Lizzie') {{was found in}} 1984. This lizard {{is one of the}} earliest known ancestors of the reptiles. The specimen was purchased in part by public subscription and is now on display in the National Museum of Scotland. The site was originally discovered in the early 19th century and has also provided fossil eurypterids, sharks and a variety of primitive acanthodian fish.|$|E
5|$|Chatteris {{is a key}} {{turning point}} on the A141 road (known as the Isle of Ely way) and the {{starting}} point of the A142 road to Ely and Suffolk (known as Ireton's Way). The town also has important links to Cambridge and the A14 via the B1050 to Bar Hill. The town centre traffic was bypassed in 1986, with the <b>disused</b> route of the former St Ives extension of the Great Eastern Railway being used to build the A141 to March and Guyhirn.|$|E
5|$|Constructed in {{the side}} of a <b>disused</b> chalk quarry, the most {{prominent}} feature of the complex is an immense concrete dome, to which its modern name refers. It was built above a network of tunnels housing storage areas, launch facilities and crew quarters. The facility was designed to store a large stockpile of V-2s, warheads and fuel and was intended to launch V-2s on an industrial scale. Dozens of missiles a day were to be fuelled, prepared and launched in rapid sequence against London and southern England.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{proximity}} of the city centre, the Žirmūnai bank of the River Neris is covered with a strip of dense deciduous forest that begins at the Žirmūnai Bridge and continues upstream (northeasterly). The forested strip is largely uninterrupted, with gaps near bridges. At the approximate centrepoint of the Žirmūnai shoreline, the forest surrounds a backwater, which had been used to park <b>disused</b> passenger ferries. The forest's northernmost section is part of a botanical nature reserve within Verkiai Regional Park.|$|E
5|$|<b>Disused</b> {{parts of}} the station and the running tunnels were used during both world wars to shelter artworks from London's public {{galleries}} and museums from bombing. The station has long been popular as a filming location and has appeared as itself and as other London Underground stations {{in a number of}} films. In recognition of its historical significance, the station is a Grade II listed building.|$|E
5|$|During the interregnum {{following}} the English Civil War, the Old Blockhouse {{was occupied by}} the Royalists and it was attacked by the Parliamentary forces of Sir Robert Blake in 1651. Blake's naval guns out-ranged those of the fort, and, after fierce fighting, the blockhouse was taken. A battery of guns was maintained at the blockhouse until at least the 1750s, {{but by the end}} of the 18th century the fortification was <b>disused</b> and in ruins.|$|E
5|$|Five days of filming {{were spent}} at the London Underground tunnels. Filming took place on actual tube tunnels, albeit <b>disused</b> ones. As the crew were {{scouting}} the <b>disused</b> Aldwych tunnels, they found the ex-Northern line 1972 stock train stabled in the tunnel for maintenance, training, and filming purposes. When Sam Miller called Cross about the development, the writer included it as a last minute addition to the script, and the sequence was shot the next day. As a way to scare the audience, Cross included a homeless woman living in the train. The filming crew present disliked filming the Underground sequences because while filmed during the summer, it became hot locations to work in. The crew were prohibited from bringing food or drink into the tunnels, as it would attract rats. Furthermore, break times had to be longer than usual because {{it would take a}} while for a crew member to leave the tunnels, have a break and then return. The FSB base was filmed in the London Docklands, near the ExCeL London.|$|E
5|$|In 2010, {{two of the}} <b>disused</b> {{platforms}} {{hosted a}} theatrical performance of The Railway Children by E. Nesbit. The audience was seated {{either side of the}} actual railway track. The show included the use of a steam locomotive coupled to one of the original carriages from the 1970s film (propelled by a diesel locomotive). The performance moved to London after two acclaimed summer runs at the National Railway Museum in York.|$|E
