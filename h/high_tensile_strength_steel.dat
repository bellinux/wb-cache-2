[...] However, with poor material quality and manufacturing techniques along with improper knowledge of design, operation and maintenance {{there was a large}} number of damaging and often fatal explosions associated with these boilers and pressure vessels, with a death occurring on a nearly daily basis in the United States. [...] Local providences and states in the US began enacting rules for constructing these vessels after some particularly devastating vessel failures occurred killing dozens of people at a time, which made it difficult for manufacturers {{to keep up with the}} varied rules from one location to another and the first pressure vessel code was developed starting in 1911 and released in 1914, starting the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (BPVC).

[...] The need for high pressure and temperature vessels for petroleum refineries and chemical plants gave rise to vessels joined with welding instead of rivets (which were unsuitable for the pressures and temperatures required) and in 1920s and 1930s the BPVC included welding as an acceptable means of construction, and welding is the main means of joining metal vessels today.|$|E

The beams incorporating reinforced mortar forms were grouped according to the mesh type, number of steel mesh layers, type of core material, and shear connection method. For all the beams incorporating precast reinforced mortar forms, the core of material was reinforced with two <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> <b>steel</b> bars of 12  mm diameter in the tension side only.

40|$|Nature is {{a master}} of preparative {{chemistry}} and there is currently considerable interest in copying Nature in the design and synthesis of advanced materials – biomimetic supramolecular chemistry. In the article three examples of such procedures are given. The first example relates to ordered mesoporous materials, which are of interest for catalysis. The approach taken to synthesize the porous materials resembles the way some marine organisms, e. g. diatoms, build porous structures. The second example concerns the spider thread. The thin threads that the spiders produce are exceptional. Calculated per weight they have <b>higher</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> than <b>steel.</b> The threads are proteinaceous materials and the secret behind their strength lies in the way the protein molecules assemble so that they all contribute in taking up the load. Synthetic fibers are made based on the same concept. The third example relates to the blue mussel adhesive. The blue mussel’s ability to stick to all kinds of surfaces – stone, iron, wood, plastics, etc. – is remarkable and it is particularly impressive that it does so in water {{in spite of the fact}} that the glue is water-based. Mimicking this would be a way to glue – or paint – a surface under wet conditions, possibly under water. Also the blue mussel adhesive is a proteinaceous material and it is believed that the key elements are catechol structures.

For the beam to act compositely, internal longitudinal actions must be transferred from the steel to the concrete through shear stud connectors. Once the stud-concrete interface starts to fracture or crush, the load carrying capacity of the beam is compromised. Shear connector capacity has been determined experimentally; however these tests do not generate a detailed understanding of the force transfer mechanisms between stud and concrete. This paper aims to characterise the behaviour of the composite beam when it fails by fracture of the concrete {{along the line of}} the studs, known as splitting failure. Experiments have been conducted on 5 steel-concrete composite beams, with shear stud connections, to investigate in detail the splitting behaviour at the stud-concrete interface. All beams were internal primary beams designed to fail by splitting. Testing was carried out on a specially developed push off rig (A.

Crack initiation and propagation in both the vertical and longitudinal direction were measured, as well as local and global strains. Results show very small changes in rib width as load is increased, giving indication of when micro and macro cracking occurred. It was shown in the cyclic test that concrete splitting and crack growth propagations occurs at very low applied loads. From these measurements it can be concluded that the zone of transverse deformation around the stud is very localized.

40|$|Abstract: CFDSCT columns are {{structural}} members that {{are filled with}} concrete and supported by circular steel tubes on the interior and exterior. These steel tubes serve as formwork and hence these members are economical and quicker to construct when compared to conventional concrete reinforced columns. They are also efficient because they {{take advantage of the}} high compressive strength of the concrete and <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> of <b>steel.</b> Despite the fact that much research is ongoing internationally in the field of CFDSCTs, no experimental tests have been conducted on intermediate and slender CFDSCTs. Current research has been focused on short CFDSCT columns and varying amounts of confinement have been found in these tests. Design codes also do not cover CFDSCTs. In order to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the behaviour of CFSDSCTs, experimental tests were conducted on 32 concrete-filled double-skin circular tube (CFDSCT) columns. The CFDSCT columns were loaded in axial compression till failure. The parameters that were varied were the lengths and diameters of the outer steel tubes, and the strength of the outer steel tubes. The lengths ranged from 1 and 2. 5 m, in half a metre increments. The CFDSCTs of one metre lengths, failed by yielding of the steel tubes. All the other CFDSCTs failed by overall buckling due to their large slenderness. Using the same philosophy as SANS 10162 - 1 and EC 4, new formulas were developed to predict the results of the strengths of the CFDSCTs. The new formulas are in a similar format to SANS 10162 - 1 and EC 4, and are 5 % and 6 % more conservative than the tests results, respectively. The ratio of the predicted results over the test results versus the slenderness was plotted and shows that the results were predicted fairly well. M. Ing. (Civil Engineering...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{quenched}} and tempered microstructures on the diffusion coefficient and solubility of hydrogen in <b>high</b> <b>tensile</b> <b>strength</b> bolt <b>steel</b> have been investigated {{by means of the}} electrochemical permeation technique. The results obtained are as follows : (1) The diffusion coefficient was minimum when the steel had the as-quenched martensitic structure or the low temperature tempered martensite, and it increased with increasing tempering temperature. The mixed structure of ferrite and lamellar pearlite obtained by furnace cooling from a temperature above Ac_ 3 gave a higher diffusion coefficient than the tempered spheroidal pearlite. On the other hand, the solubility of hydrogen showed a behavior opposite to the diffusion coefficient. (2) The low diffusion coefficient and high solubility are attributed predominantly to hydrogen trapping at the lattice imperfections, such as dislocations and faults etc., which were introduced by martensitic transformation during quenching. (3) With regard to the effect of cathodic current density, i. e., the hydrogen concentration directly below the surface on hydrogen diffusion in tempered steel, the diffusion coefficient hardly depended upon the hydrogen concentration but the solubility of hydrogen increased up to a certain value with increasing cathodic current density. On the other hand, the hydrogen permeation current efficiency decreased with increasing cathodic current density. (4) The activation energies for hydrogen diffusion in the tempered martensite, tempered fine and/or spheroidal pearlites in the temperature range of 6 to 61 ℃, were almost constant (about 8. 1 kcal/mol) but the pre-exponential factor increased with tempering temperature. The heats of solution of hydrogen in the tempered martensite and tempered pearlites were almost the same (about - 10. 3 kcal/mol), indicating the exothermic reaction.
