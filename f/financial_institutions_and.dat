5|$|As {{chair of}} Bloomington Conservation Project, Horch and the Master Institute of United Arts led {{an effort to}} improve {{deteriorated}} housing by converting single-family brownstone buildings into rent-subsidized apartments. Efforts like those of this project ameliorated conditions to some extent, but the Bloomingdale area {{did not return to}} prosperity until the late 1980s and early 1990s, when the city as a whole experienced an economic rebound. As high-paying white-collar employment in <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> other service industries replaced long-departed blue-collar jobs in the industrial sector, real estate speculators found that they could profit from new condos and co-ops either by replacing old buildings or by renovating them.|$|E

In 1999, Ryan supported the Gramm–Leach–Bliley Act, which repealed some financial regulation of banks from the Glass–Steagall Act of 1933. During the economic recovery from the Great Recession of the late 2000s, Ryan supported the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), which authorized the Treasury to purchase toxic assets from banks and other <b>financial</b> <b>institutions,</b> <b>and</b> the auto industry bailout; Ryan opposed the Credit CARD Act of 2009, which expanded consumer protections regarding credit card plans, and the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act, which strengthened financial regulation.|$|E

As an Allied victory was won in Europe, a 1945 international conference held in San Francisco produced the United Nations Charter, which became active after the war.

5|$|On 29 September 2008, it was {{announced}} that Glitnir would be nationalised. However, subsequent efforts to restore faith in the banking system failed. On 6 October, the Icelandic legislature instituted an emergency law which enabled the Financial Supervisory Authority (FME) to take control over <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> made domestic deposits in the banks priority claims. In the following days, new banks were founded to take over the domestic operations of Kaupthing, Landsbanki and Glitnir. The old banks were put into receivership and liquidation, resulting in losses for their shareholders and foreign creditors. Outside Iceland, {{more than half a million}} depositors lost access to their accounts in foreign branches of Icelandic banks. This led to the 2008–2013 Icesave dispute, that ended with a ESA ruling that Iceland was not obliged to repay Dutch and British depositors minimum deposit guarantees.|$|E
5|$|Warren was {{an early}} {{advocate}} {{for the creation of}} a new Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB). The bureau was established by the Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act signed into law by President Obama in July 2010. In September 2010, President Obama named Warren Assistant to the President and Special Advisor to the Secretary of the Treasury on the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to set up the new agency. While liberal groups and consumer advocacy groups pushed for Obama to formally nominate Warren as the agency's director, Warren was strongly opposed by <b>financial</b> <b>institutions</b> <b>and</b> by Republican members of Congress who believed Warren would be an overly zealous regulator. Reportedly convinced that Warren could not win Senate confirmation as the bureau's first director, Obama turned to former Ohio Attorney General Richard Cordray and in January 2012, over the objections of Republican senators, appointed Cordray to the post in a recess appointment.|$|E

50|$|An early {{withdrawal}} risk {{affects a}} rollover risk through decrease of cash flows {{that will be}} repaid in the future. The early withdrawal and rollover risks depend on a term to maturity of deposits. The more maturity, the more early withdrawal risk, and the lower rollover risk, and vice versa. The main financial determinants of the early withdrawal and rollover risks are interest rates of the <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> its competitors, term to maturity and age of deposit, credit rating of the <b>financial</b> <b>institution,</b> <b>and</b> amount of deposit insurance.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relation}} between the quality of <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> asset bubbles. In this paper, we will show that bubbles can improve the macro performance even if the quality of financial in- stitution is very poor and the financial market does not work well. In this sense, the high quality of <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> <b>and</b> bubbles are substitutes. We will explore, however, that they are not perfect substi- tutes. Bubbles may burst. If bubbles burst, the economic performance must go down if the quality of <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> is low. Hence, we will show that not relaying on bubbles, but improving the quality of <b>financial</b> <b>institution</b> is important for long run macro performance. ...|$|R
