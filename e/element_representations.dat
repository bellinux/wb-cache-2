For example, unlike most other models, SOP takes time into account. The rise and decay of element activation enables the model to explain time-dependent effects such as the fact that conditioning is strongest when the CS comes just before the US, and that when the CS comes after the US (“backward conditioning”) the result is often an inhibitory CS. Many other more subtle phenomena are explained as well. [...] A number of other powerful models have appeared in recent years which incorporate <b>element</b> <b>representations.</b> These often include the assumption that associations involve a network of connections between “nodes” that represent stimuli, responses, and perhaps one or more “hidden” layers of intermediate interconnections. Such models make contact with a current explosion of research on neural networks, artificial intelligence and machine learning.|$|E
50|$|An {{alternative}} to using bounding box-based rigid body physics systems {{is to use}} a finite element-based system. In such a system, a 3-dimensional, volumetric tessellation is created of the 3D object. The tessellation results in a number of finite elements which represent aspects of the object's physical properties such as toughness, plasticity, and volume preservation. Once constructed, the finite elements are used by a solver to model the stress within the 3D object. The stress can be used to drive fracture, deformation and other physical effects {{with a high degree of}} realism and uniqueness. As the number of modeled elements is increased, the engine's ability to model physical behavior increases. The visual representation of the 3D object is altered by the finite element system through the use of a deformation shader run on the CPU or GPU. Finite Element-based systems had been impractical for use in games due to the performance overhead and the lack of tools to create finite <b>element</b> <b>representations</b> out of 3D art objects. With higher performance processors and tools to rapidly create the volumetric tessellations, real-time finite element systems began to be used in games, beginning with Star Wars: The Force Unleashed that used Digital Molecular Matter for the deformation and destruction effects of wood, steel, flesh and plants using an algorithm developed by Dr. James O'Brien as a part of his PhD thesis.|$|E

The new flux-based representations introduced offer an improved physical interpretation of the problem along with computationally convenient and attractive features. The space and time discretization emanate from a conservation form of the governing equation for thermal problems, and in conjunction with the flux-based <b>element</b> <b>representations</b> give rise to a physically improved and locally conservative numerical formulations. The present representations seek to involve improved locally conservative properties, improved physical representations and computational features; these are based on a 2 D, bilinear FV element and can be extended for other cases.

40|$|Icons {{continue}} to gain popularity in human computer interfaces. Icon design and evaluation guidelines however, {{continue to}} develop in order to know, prior to testing, the elements that make an icon appropriate. Most previous studies related to icons have investigated the design aspects. Nevertheless, the results of those studies cannot be used in new designs of icons as they have concentrated on the artistic aspects rather than the function the icon represents. The objective {{of this study is}} to investigate the relationship between an icon and the function it represents and the relative importance of the function's elements for the icon to be considered appropriate. The goal is to identify and prioritize the elemental representations in the icon. The key factor in this study is the division of functions into functional elements that represent action, object, and utility elements. An experiment was conducted with 50 Hong Kong Chinese participants. The participants rated the icons in terms of appropriateness, overall meaning of the function, and <b>element</b> <b>representations</b> on a 7 -point scale. The ANOVA and pair-wise comparison's results showed that the <b>element</b> <b>representations</b> explain the variations of meaning and appropriateness of a computer icon. Correlation analysis supported by factor analysis results indicate that the importance ranking among the elements differ and they can be used as an indicator of overall meaning and appropriateness...|$|E
40|$|Sudoku puzzles are now {{popular among}} people in many {{countries}} across the world with simple constraints that no repeated digits in each row, each column, or each block. In this paper, we demonstrate that the Sudoku configuration provides us a new alternative way of matrix element representation by using block-grid pair besides the conventional row-column pair. Moreover, we discover six more matrix <b>element</b> <b>representations</b> by using row-digit pair, digit-row pair, column-digit pair, digit-column pair, block-digit pair, and digit-block pair associated with a Sudoku matrix. These parametric Sudoku associated matrix <b>element</b> <b>representations</b> not only allow us to denote matrix elements in secret ways, but also provide us new parametric two-dimensional bijective mappings. We study these two-dimensional bijections in the problem of image scrambling and propose a simple but effective Sudoku Associated Image Scrambler only using Sudoku associated two dimensional bijections for image scrambling without bandwidth expansion. Our simulation results over a wide collection of image types and contents demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Scrambler performance analysis with comparisons to peer algorithms under various investigation methods, including human visual inspections, gray degree of scrambling, autocorrelation coefficient of adjacent pixels, and key space and key sensitivities, suggest that the proposed method outperforms or at least reaches state-of-the-art. Similar scrambling ideas are also applicable to other digital data forms such as audio and video. Comment: 30 pages, 13 figure...|$|E
