40|$|We {{have devised}} a {{technique}} of two-stage tracheal reconstruction using S-shaped skin flaps and an aural conchal cartilage graft. During the first operation, S-shaped skin flaps were elevated before resection of the trachea. A tracheocutaneous fistula was created at the tracheal defect using S-shaped skin flaps while placing the conchal cartilage graft underneath. During the second operation, a skin incision was made around the fistula {{to elevate the}} <b>hinge</b> <b>flaps,</b> including the cartilage. The edges of the <b>hinge</b> <b>flaps</b> were sutured to form the tracheal lumen, and {{the area of the}} skin defect was then closed with double-rotation skin flaps...|$|R
25|$|Prolific {{inventor}} Joseph Bramah {{began his}} professional career installing water closets (toilets) that {{were based on}} Alexander Cumming's patented design of 1775.

In collaboration with a Mr Allen, he improved the design by replacing the usual slide valve with a <b>hinged</b> <b>flap</b> that sealed the bottom of the bowl.|$|E
25|$|Similarly, {{a simple}} steel tube {{structure}} in {{the nose of the}} fuselage was used to support the engine; detachable panels across the cowling provided access to most of the engine's areas for inspection or adjustment purposes. Installed underneath the fuselage, the liquid-cooled radiator has a rectangular opening to its aft; this is covered by a <b>hinged</b> <b>flap</b> via which the pilot was able to actively vary the cooling level. An atypical feature for the era was the use of tungum pipes throughout the cooling system.|$|E
2500|$|Camm's {{priority}} {{was to provide}} the pilot with good all-round visibility. To this end, the cockpit was mounted reasonably high in the fuselage, creating a distinctive [...] "hump-backed" [...] silhouette. Pilot access to the cockpit was aided by a retractable [...] "stirrup" [...] mounted below {{the trailing edge of}} the port wing. This was linked to a spring-loaded <b>hinged</b> <b>flap</b> which covered a handhold on the fuselage, just behind the cockpit. When the flap was shut, the footstep retracted into the fuselage. In addition, both wing roots were coated with strips of non-slip material.|$|E
40|$|Case summary An {{approximately}} 3 -year-old, male domestic longhair cat {{was presented}} to a mobile veterinary unit for routine neuter. Preoperative physical examination revealed an approximately 5 cm × 2 cm scab on the craniolateral portion of the left antebrachium. The cat was anesthetized for the neuter using an injectable anesthesia protocol. After castration, the wound area on the antebrachium was clipped, copiously lavaged and the wound edges were surgically debrided. Injectable antibiotics and analgesic management were instituted. The wound was conservatively managed using sugar bandaging and antibiotic dressings until the progression of healing plateaued. Procedures for closing the defect were explored, and {{it was decided that}} a single-pedicle <b>hinge</b> <b>flap</b> would be ideal. The procedure was performed on the mobile veterinary unit and managed postoperatively with pain control and biweekly bandage changes. After 3 weeks, the single-pedicle <b>hinge</b> <b>flap</b> was released to create a skin graft, which successfully filled the defect. Relevance and novel information Single-pedicle <b>hinge</b> <b>flaps</b> performed in feline patients have been minimally reported. This case report serves to provide detailed information on the surgical procedure and aftercare required for a successful outcome. Furthermore, this procedure was performed by a shelter medicine team in a mobile veterinary unit with no specialty equipment or instruments.

30|$|Several {{procedures}} to close tracheocutaneous fistulae have been previously reported [1 – 7]. However, no standard, easily performed procedure {{has been established}} worldwide. One advantage of the procedure described herein is that postoperative tracheal stenosis secondary to granulation {{is not likely to}} occur because the tracheal lumen is covered by inversed skin epithelium. The bilateral <b>hinge</b> <b>flaps</b> closing the tracheal defect can be lifted from not only the left and right sides but also from the upper and lower sides depending on the form of the defect. Moreover, the superfluous skin of each <b>hinge</b> <b>flap</b> can be trimmed to create appropriately sized flaps. Another advantage is that recurrence of the tracheocutaneous fistula after wound dehiscence is not likely to occur because the suture line of the skin cannot overlap with that of the subcutaneous tissue. Most patients can undergo this procedure with local anesthesia. This technique for closing tracheocutaneous fistulae after tracheostomy using two skin flaps is thus considered to be beneficial.|$|R
2500|$|The {{front end}} of the Range Rover was revamped in 1986. This brought a more pedestrian-friendly plastic grille with {{horizontal}} slats, and optional front valance with two fog lights. The seat base was lowered and door handles were redesigned, making it more difficult for rear passengers but greatly improving the comfort for taller people in the front. The dashboard switchgear was updated again, now featuring steering column stalks from the Austin Montego, and other miscellaneous items from the Austin Rover car range. [...] Other changes included the windows, tailgate and bonnet, but none of those affected the general design. Bonnet and door hinges gradually evolved out of sight and the fuel filler cap was hidden behind a <b>hinged</b> <b>flap.</b> [...] The last major change to the interior took place in 1994, when the Range Rover was re-designated [...] "Classic" [...] upon the arrival of the replacement P38A version. The car gained a 'soft feel' safety dashboard (derived from that used in the facelifted Series 1 Discovery) with new switches (this time lifted from the Rover 800) and instruments. [...] These end of the line models are popularly called [...] "soft dash" [...] models by the motor trade and by enthusiasts to distinguish them from other members of the Range Rover Classic series.|$|E
60|$|The early mornings {{were still}} {{sufficiently}} cool to render a fire acceptable {{in the large}} room wherein they breakfasted; and, by Mrs Crick's orders, who held {{that he was too}} genteel to mess at their table, it was Angel Clare's custom to sit in the yawning chimney-corner during the meal, his cup-and-saucer and plate being placed on a <b>hinged</b> <b>flap</b> at his elbow. The light from the long, wide, mullioned window opposite shone in upon his nook, and, assisted by a secondary light of cold blue quality which shone down the chimney, enabled him to read there easily whenever disposed to do so. Between Clare and the window was the table at which his companions sat, their munching profiles rising sharp against the panes; while to the side was the milk-house door, through which were visible the rectangular leads in rows, full to the brim with the morning's milk.

40|$|The Savonius rotor {{can develop}} a {{relatively}} high torque at low rotational speeds and is cheap to build, but it harnesses {{only a small fraction}} of the wind energy incident upon it. One initially attractive proposal for augmenting its harnessing effectiveness, was to fit an array of <b>hinged</b> <b>flaps</b> in place of the curved parts of the turbine's blades. The flaps open automatically as a result of wind pressure when they advance into the wind (and hence experience less flow-resistance), but close (again automatically) when retreating from the wind, i. e. during the power-harnessing part of the cycle. It had been found previously that this arrangement, as required, significantly enhances the static torque imposed by the wind on the rotor. So, in this study, dynamic-torque and power-harnessing tests were carried out for a Savonius rotor as well as for rotors modified with 8 or subsequently 16 <b>hinged</b> <b>flaps.</b> The modified rotors displayed slightly increased torques at low rotational speeds, but the traditional Savonius rotor developed a peak power-coefficient of 18 % compared with only 5 % for the slatted turbines. ...|$|R

50|$|Emulating these control methods, in 1884-1885 he {{incorporated}} <b>hinged</b> <b>flaps</b> {{into the}} trailing {{edge of a}} second glider.

In essence these flaps were very early ailerons. The second glider had a flat plate airfoil, considerable dihedral for stability and an operable elevator for pitch control. Montgomery devised an inclined rail system so the piloted glider could roll from the top of a hill and attain enough speed for flight.|$|R

40|$|AbstractGlaucoma is {{a leading}} cause of {{blindness}} worldwide and results from damage to the optic nerve. Currently, intraocular pressure is the only treatable risk factor. Changes in aqueous outflow regulate pressure; regulation becomes abnormal in glaucoma. From inside the eye aqueous flows out through the trabecular meshwork into a venous sinus called Schlemm’s canal, next into collector channels and finally returns to the episcleral vessels of the venous system. The location of aqueous outflow regulation is unknown. Ex vivo and in vivo studies implicate both pressure-dependent trabecular tissue motion and tissues distal to Schlemm’s canal in regulation of aqueous outflow. Technologies have not previously been available to study these issues. New ex vivo imaging in human eyes identifies <b>hinged</b> <b>flaps</b> or leaflets at collector channel entrances using a high-resolution spectral domain optical coherence tomography (SD-OCT) platform. The <b>hinged</b> <b>flaps</b> open and close in synchrony with pressure-dependent trabecular meshwork motion. The SD-OCT platform images from the trabecular meshwork surface while experimentally changing transtrabecular pressure gradients. New in vivo imaging in human eyes uses a motion sensitive technology, phase-sensitive OCT to quantitate real-time pulse-dependent trabecular tissue motion as well as absence of such motion when aqueous access to the outflow system is blocked. The recent studies suggest that aqueous outflow regulation results from synchronous pressure-dependent motion involving a network of interconnected tissues including those distal to Schlemm’s canal. The new imaging technologies may shed light on glaucoma mechanisms and provide guidance in the management of medical, laser and surgical decisions in glaucoma...|$|R

PRESENTATION OF CASEAn 11 -year-old boy underwent {{surgery to repair}} a tracheocutaneous fistula, using skin and muscle flaps. A vertical incision was made around the fistula and 3 skin flaps were prepared: 2 <b>hinge</b> <b>flaps,</b> and 1 to cover the skin defect (advanced <b>flap).</b> The 2 <b>hinged</b> turnover <b>flaps</b> were invaginated by multiple layered sutures, and a strap muscle flap was placed over the resulting tracheal closure. An advanced skin flap was used to cover {{the area of the}} previous defect. The patient was extubated immediately after surgery. He was discharged on the sixth postoperative day without tracheal leakage or subcutaneous emphysema. The patient is currently doing well, with no respiratory symptoms and no recurrence at the postoperative 5 months.
