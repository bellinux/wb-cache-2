40|$|Cardiomyocyte N-methyl-d-aspartate receptor- 1 (NMDA-R 1) {{activation}} induces mitochondrial dysfunction. Matrix metalloproteinase protease (MMP) induction is {{a negative}} regulator of mitochondrial function. Elevated levels of homocysteine [hyperhomocysteinemia (HHCY) ] activate latent MMPs and causes myocardial contractile abnormalities. HHCY is associated with mitochondrial dysfunction. We tested the hypothesis that HHCY activates myocyte mitochondrial MMP (mtMMP), induces mitochondrial permeability transition (MPT), and causes contractile dysfunction by agonizing NMDA-R 1. The C 57 BL/ 6 J mice were administered homocystinemia (1. 8 g/l) in drinking water to induce HHCY. NMDA-R 1 expression was detected by Western blot and confocal microscopy. Localization of MMP- 9 in the mitochondria was determined using confocal microscopy. Ultrastructural analysis of the isolated myocyte was determined by electron microscopy. Mitochondrial permeability was measured by a decrease in light absorbance at 540 nm using the spectrophotometer. The effect of MK- 801 (NMDA-R 1 inhibitor), GM- 6001 (MMP inhibitor), and cyclosporine A (MPT inhibitor) on myocyte contractility and calcium transients was evaluated using the IonOptix video <b>edge</b> <b>track</b> detection system and fura 2 -AM. Our results demonstrate that HHCY activated the mtMMP- 9 and caused MPT by agonizing NMDA-R 1. A significant decrease in percent cell shortening, maximal rate of contraction (−dL/dt), and maximal rate of relaxation (+dL/dt) was observed in HHCY. The decay of calcium transient amplitude was faster in the wild type compared with HHCY. Furthermore, the HHCY-induced decrease in percent cell shortening, −dL/dt, and +dL/dt was attenuated in the mice treated with MK- 801, GM- 6001, and cyclosporin A. We conclude that HHCY activates mtMMP- 9 and induces MPT, leading to myocyte mechanical dysfunction by agonizing NMDA-R 1...|$|E

In tactile object recognition, it is necessary to determine the location and orientation of object edges and surfaces. A controller is proposed that utilizes a tactile sensor in the feedback loop of a manipulator to <b>track</b> along <b>edges.</b> In the control system, the data from the tactile sensor is first processed to find edges. The parameters of these edges are then used to generate a control signal to a hybrid controller. Theory is presented for tactile edge detection and an <b>edge</b> <b>tracking</b> controller.

Consideration is given first to pure synchronization using a periodic pulsed intensity, then extended to the case where position modulation is present and auxiliary bit decisioning is needed to aid the tracking operation.

40|$|The wavelet {{transform}} provides a multiresolution representation of images. Edges, which are visually important, produce large coefficients across several scales in the {{wavelet transform}} domain. By tracking and predicting these edge coefficients across scales in the wavelet transform domain, we can greatly improve the compressed image quality with little degradation in compression ratio. This paper proposes a novel model-based <b>edge</b> <b>tracking</b> and prediction in wavelet domain. It separates textures from edges and codes them differently. Edges are coded via an <b>edge</b> <b>tracking</b> and prediction, while textures are coded with either ordinary wavelet based image coding techniques or a "wavelet-like" filter bank {{which is similar}} to the tuning channels in human vision system. The coding noise is then coded with a noise modelling. Visual masking models are also used to ensure the compressed image has little or almost no perceptual distortion. 1.

40|$|Local {{arterial}} stiffness can {{be assessed}} with high accuracy and precision by measuring arterial distension {{on the basis of}} phase tracking of radiofrequency ultrasound signals acquired at a high frame rate. However, in clinical practice, B-mode ultrasound registrations are made at a low frame rate (20 - 50 Hz). We compared the accuracy and intra-subject precision of <b>edge</b> <b>tracking</b> and phase tracking distension in symptomatic carotid artery patients. B-mode ultrasound recordings (40 mm, 37 fps) and radiofrequency recordings (31 lines covering 29 mm, 300 fps) were acquired from the left common carotid artery of 30 patients (aged 45 - 88 y) with recent cerebrovascular events. To extract the distension, semi-automatic echo <b>edge</b> and phase <b>tracking</b> algorithms were applied to B-mode and radiofrequency recordings, respectively. Both methods exhibited a similar intra-subject precision for distension (standard deviation = 44 mum and 47 mum, p = 0. 66) and mean distension (difference: - 6 +/- 69 mum, p = 0. 67). Intra-subject distension inhomogeneity tends to be larger for <b>edge</b> <b>tracking</b> (difference: 15 +/- 35 mum, p = 0. 04). Standard B-mode scanners are suitable for measuring local artery characteristics in symptomatic carotid artery patients with good precision and accuracy...|$|R

Perturbations that are {{not strong enough to}} become fully turbulent nor weak enough to relaminarize tend towards a hyperbolic coherent structure in state space, termed the edge state, which seems to be unique up to obvious continuous shift symmetries. The results reported here show that in cases where a fixed point has only one unstable direction, as for the lower branch solution in in plane Couette flow, the iterated <b>edge</b> <b>tracking</b> algorithm converges to this state. They also show that choice of initial state is not critical, and that essentially arbitrary initial conditions can be used to find the edge state. Comment: 4 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} markerless {{tracking}} approach for augmented reality in poorly textured environments. The approach enables a robust and accurate camera pose estimation merely on {{basis of a}} coarse edge model. The edge model of the object to be tracked is enhanced and refined during the <b>tracking</b> process. New <b>edges</b> {{are added to the}} edge model and already existing ones are refined. A collection of reference poses with a set of corresponding edges, called keyposes, enables a selection of good <b>edges</b> to <b>track</b> depending on the current view and makes the tracking process robust and accurate. Keyposes are also used to reinitialize automatically after tracking failures, e. g. the object to be tracked is occluded. Therefore, the proposed method overcomes the limitations of traditionally used <b>edge</b> based <b>tracking</b> approaches in terms of reinitialization and edge model creation. Evaluation on synthetic and real image sequences demonstrates the significant improvement of the proposed method over a standard <b>edge</b> based <b>tracking...</b>|$|R
