40|$|Graduation date: 1969 Acidity {{distribution}} {{within any}} given soil profile {{is dependent on}} mineralogical make-up of the parent material as well as environmental conditions prevalent during the weathering history of the soil. An experiment was designed to study the distribution pattern of <b>exchange</b> <b>acidity,</b> exchangeable aluminum, exchangeable manganese and pH of six acid soils of Western Oregon. 1 N KCl extracts of four depths of each soil were obtained and the levels of the parameters mentioned above were measured. It was found that various soil series had different acidity distribution patterns within their profiles. Also, a highly significant linear correlation was observed between <b>exchange</b> <b>acidity</b> and exchangeable aluminum of each soil. Liming acid soils raises pH of the soil extract and improves its fertility status. The rise in pH is due to neutralization of acid groups or acid-producing species present in various forms and on various sites in the soil system. One group of these acid producing species is the exchangeable form of various hydrolyzable cations, especially Al⁺³, H₃O⁺, Mn⁺², also perhaps Fe⁺³, and others. These cations are extracted with solutions of 1 N neutral salts such as KC 1 and are neutralized by hydroxyls of the applied lime. A second experiment was designed to study the effect of liming, using an incubation procedure, on <b>exchange</b> <b>acidity,</b> exchangeable aluminum, exchangeable manganese and pH of these soils. It was observed that additions of increments of Ca(OH) ₂ to soil resulted in progressive increase in pH of the soil extract {{and the relationship between}} pH and amounts of lime applied was curvilinear with the titration curves approximating linear patterns. As lime rates increase, there was a drop in both Al⁺³ and <b>exchange</b> <b>acidity</b> content of the soil extract as well as the amount of Mn⁺² extracted. For all these three parameters the initial drop was much sharper than the subsequent reductions occurring due to further additions of lime. Point of zero acidity or zero exchangeable aluminum did not necessarily coincide with pH of neutrality. Applications of lime to acid soils improves their crop raising ability, especially with regard to legumes. A third experiment was set up to study the response pattern of alfalfa (Medicago sativa L. var. Du Puits) to lime and phosphorous applications and the effect of such applications on aluminum, manganese, phosphorous, and calcium concentrations of plant tops. Significant yield responses were obtained in some cases but not in others. Phosphorous concentration of the tops was not significantly affected, but aluminum, manganese, and calcium concentrations were affected to varying degrees...|$|E

The optimum point is on a pH value of about 6, <b>exchange</b> <b>acidity</b> y 1 1, and exchangeable calcium 10 m. e. / 100 gm. As the pH value and calcium content of the soil surpass the optimum point, The plant grows less actively, but its normal growth can be seen till on the alkaline soil such as pH 8. 06, <b>exchange</b> <b>acidity</b> y 1 trace, exchangeable calcium 23 m. e. / 100 gm. (Table 1) The percentage of calcium contained in the plant becomes higher with increasing rate of liming. Thus content of calcium in the airial part of the plant ranges from 0. 3 ％ at pH 4. 6, <b>exchange</b> <b>acidity</b> y 1 37 exchangeable calcium 1 m. e. / 100 gm. to 0. 6 ％ at pH 8. 06, <b>exchange</b> <b>acidity</b> y 1 trace, exchangeable Ca 23 m. e. / 100 gm. and as a whole, it settles at the point of an average 0. 5 ％ (Table 4) On the other hand the amount of phosphorus in the plant is less affected by the addition of CaCO 3 than in the case of calcium and nitrogen, and the percentage of phosphorus in the plant is very low when compared with that of calcium which is given in table 4. The average value of the former is 0. 02 ％. The content of crude protein is increased by the application of the fertilizer, and also by the addition of lime, proportional to the increasing amount of the latter. But liming the soil of pH above 8. 01, causes decrease in the crude protein content of the plant. From the results obtained through these studies it is considered that this plant does not need much Ca and P elements, so that it could flourish on reclaimed land lacking in Ca and P elements. The Crab-grass seems to have a very remarkable degree of adaptability to the Ca content in the soil, so that it could widly distribute over the strong acid soil and lime-stone regions. These studies will give a suggestion {{on the use of the}} Crab-grass as forage plants. メヒシバの生態分布の機構及び其の飼料価値を追究する目的で, 無肥料又は施肥状態に於ける石灰加用のメヒシバ体成分に及ぼす影響につき研究した. メヒシバは適量の肥料分があると, 強酸性で置換石灰の極めて少い土壌（pH 4. 5 ～ 6. 5 置換酸度y 1 37, 置換石灰 1. 7 m. e. / 100 gm. ）に於てもよく繁茂する. そして生育の最適点は pH 6, 置換酸度 y 1 1, 置換石灰 10 m. e. / 100 gm. である. それ以上 pH 値が上昇すると幾分生長が落ちるが, pH 8. 06, 置換酸度 y 1 trace, 置換石灰 23 m. e. / 100 gm. に於ても正常に繁茂する. メヒシバ地上部のカルシウム含量は CaCO 3 の添加量の増加と共に上昇する. 即ちカルシウム含量は pH 約 4. 6, 置換酸度 y 1 37, 置換石灰 1. 7 m. e. / 100 mg. で約 0. 3 %, pH 8. 06, 置換酸度 y 1 trace, 置換石灰 23 m. e. / 100 mg. で 0. 6 ％, 平均約 0. 5 ％である（Table 4 ）. 一方燐の含量は石灰作用の影響が少く, その含量もカルシウムに比して極めて少くて平均約 0. 02 ％にすぎない. 粗蛋白質の含量は適量の施肥及び石灰の加用によつて増加する. しかし pH 8. 01 以上に石灰を加えると粗蛋白質の量は却つて減少する. 以上の結果によつて見るに, メヒシバは石灰及び燐の要求度が少く, 土壌の酸度に対する抵抗力が強いことがメヒシバをして強酸性で, しかも燐成分に乏しい開墾地に跋扈させる所以である. 又土壌中の石灰含量に対する適応力が大きい事が本種が強酸性土壌から石灰岩地帯にかけて広く分布する一つの原因である. 尚本研究による結果は, メヒシバを飼料として利用する際にも役立つであろう...|$|E

40|$|Background: In {{precision}} agriculture, rapid, non-destructive, cost-effective {{and convenient}} soil analysis techniques {{are needed for}} soil management, crop quality control using fertilizer, manure and compost, and variable-rate input for soil variability in a field. Visible and near-infrared spectroscopy is an effective measurement method for estimating multiple soil properties at once. Methods: The experimental site is a commercial paddy field in lbaraki Prefectural Government, Japan. The experiment was conducted on 5 fields (6. 4 ha) after harvesting for development of multiple local calibration models (MLCM). To develop MLCM, soil samples were collected a total of 100 soil samples from the corresponding scanning positions of Vis-NIR data using Tractor-mounted soil analysing system (SAS). Partial least-squares regression coupled with leave-one-out cross-validation method were used to establish the relationship between Vis-NIR underground soil reflectance spectra captured by SAS and MLCM were obtained through soil analysis. To develop MLCM, the Unscrambler V 9. 8 software was used. We show coefficient of determination (R 2) and residual prediction deviation (RPD). Results: We obtained MLCM based on Vis-NIR underground soil reflectance spectra collected using SAS. The investigated soil properties were moisture content, soil organic matter, pH, electrical conductivity, cation exchange capacity, total carbon, ammonium nitrogen, hot water exchangeable nitrogen, nitrate nitrogen, total nitrogen, exchangeable potassium, exchangeable calcium, exchangeable magnesium, hot water soluble soil boron, soluble copper, exchangeable manganese, soluble zinc, available phosphate, C/N ratio, MgO/K 20 ratio, CaO/MgO ratio, lime saturation degree, base saturation degree, phosphate absorption coefficient, <b>exchange</b> <b>acidity,</b> free iron oxide, sodium oxide, available silicate, bulk density, sand, silt and clay.

30|$|Zeolites {{employed}} in manufacture of the FCC catalysts are synthetic versions of naturally occurring zeolites called faujasites.

Zeolites possess particular characteristics of crystalline structure and acidity which {{are responsible for}} their capability to catalyze chemical reactions. The pore system of Y {{is characterized by a}} set of four tetrahedrally oriented 12 -membered ring opening leading to a larger central cavity, i.e., supercage. The pore opening is 0.74  nm in diameter, while the supercage is 1.2  nm in diameter. Due to the large number of cationic sites in high surface area zeolite resulting from Si and Al atoms and possibly also due to electric field gradients set up by the cationic sites in the nanopores and cages of zeolites, a large number of acid sites with special concentration and strength are formed. Nevertheless, zeolite acid concentration and strength vary over a wide range, mainly as a function of Si/Al ratio. Generally, the acid site concentration is simply proportional to the inverse of the Si/Al ratio; in contrast, acid site strength varies inversely with Si/Al ratio. However, to modify the stability and acidity and satisfy the requirements of FCC conditions, zeolite Y is typically modified by ion <b>exchange</b> generating <b>acidity,</b> or hydrothermal treatment producing the so-called ultrastable Y (USY), or exchanging with multivalent cations such as rare-earth ions (La 3 + and Ce 3 +) for improving acid strength.|$|R

Oxygen isotope compositions may characterize formation conditions but subsequent isotope exchange {{may have occurred}} between the sulfate and hydroxide of jarosite and water. The rate of oxygen isotope exchange depends on the acidity and temperature of the brine, {{but it has not}} been investigated in detail. We performed laboratory experiments to determine the rate of oxygen isotope <b>exchange</b> under varying <b>acidities</b> and temperatures to learn more about this process. Barium sulfate samples were precipitated weekly from acidic sodium sulfate brines. The oxygen isotope composition of the precipitated sulfate was obtained using a Finnigan MAT 253 Isotope Ratio Mass-Spectrometer. The results show that water was trapped in barium sulfate during precipitation. Trapped water may exchange with sulfate when exposed to high temperatures, thus changing the isotope composition of sulfate and the observed fractionation factor of oxygen isotope exchange between sulfate and water. The results of our research will contribute to the understanding of oxygen isotope exchange rates between water and sulfate under acidic conditions and provide experimental knowledge for the dehydration of barium sulfate samples...|$|R
40|$|Huge {{amount of}} papers {{describe}} plant response to drought, however information on reaction of plant roots {{cation exchange capacity}} and surface acidity on draught conditions is up to date lacking. These parameters are important for amount and ratio of cations uptake by plants. Since other stresses induce changes in roots cation <b>exchange</b> capacity and <b>acidity,</b> we hypothesized that draught does this also. In this paper we checked this hypothesis. Surface charge properties of roots of drought tolerant and draught resistant barley varieties taken from pot (soil draught at water potential pF= 3. 5) and hydroponic (osmotic stress induced by mannitol) experiments were determined using back-titration method. The stresses were applied at tillering stage. Soil draught and osmotic stress caused even fivefold decrease in cation exchange capacity and up to tenfold increase in acidity of roots of all barley varieties. Surface charge properties of nonstressed roots did not differentiate draught resistant and draught tolerant varieties, however the intensity of roots reaction on the stresses seemed to be higher for draught sensitive plants. This newly presented mechanism of plant reaction on drought indicates that nutrients uptake by plants can be severely limited and relative uptake of polyvalent cations (aluminum or heavy metals) may increase causing additional toxicity. This may serve as additional explanation of plant growth and yield limitation in dry environments...|$|R

This study provides quantitative {{data on the}} quality of some rehabilitated and un-rehabilitated mined soils within the AngloGold-Ashanti gold concession in parts of the semi-deciduous forest zone of Ghana. Soil properties determined included texture, bulk density and aggregate stability, pH, organic carbon, available phosphorus, total nitrogen, cation exchange capacity, exchangeable bases, <b>exchange</b> <b>acidity,</b> Fe, Mn, Ni, Cu, Zn, Cd, and Pb. Aggregate stability as a physical quality indicator revealed that aggregates of the rehabilitated mined soil had become more stable and similar to the control unmined soil due to litter and carbon additions from planted trees. The nutrient levels were very low {{because of the presence of}} low activity clays inherent in the native soil. Organic carbon content in the rehabilitated soil had increased above that of the unrehabilitated soil. Variability in soil properties, especially organic carbon and aggregate stability, was minimal in the unmined and rehabilitated soils implying that soils at the two sites were most robust and resistant to crushing and rupture. Quality index of the unmined control soil was 36. 5 % indicating that the quality of the soil was 63. 5 % relative to the optimum quality because of inherent poor soil properties. The mined rehabilitated and unrehabilitated soil had index values of 32. 5 % and 24. 4 %, respectively. The marginal difference of 4 % in soil quality between the control and rehabilitated soil shows that it is possible to maintain the health of soils with inherent physical and biochemical deficiencies if reclamation regulations are adhered to. In this way, the socio-economic dilemma of exploiting natural resources for the benefit of societies is ameliorated while maintaining an ecosystem balance...|$|E
40|$|Changes in the {{physical}} and chemical properties of the surface layers of soil of a slash-and-burn swidden (garden) in a tropical and ever-humid climate region in northwest Malaita Island, Solomon Islands, were investigated. Soil samples were obtained from the same site nearly spanning the entire swidden cycle and from an almost adjacent long fallow forest. The fallow period in the swidden cycle was slightly more than ten years. The soil there was found to be acidic. The changes in physical properties suggest that slight soil compaction of the surface layers occurred during the fallow, and that the soil became softer, and more permeable with increasing fallow length. The changes in the content of organic carbon seem to parallel this change. Both organic carbon and total nitrogen in the topsoil had the lowest value {{in the middle of the}} fallow period. The surface layers accumulated much organic matter during the long fallow period. The levels of available phosphorus, exchangeable calcium, magnesium, potassium, and sodium, base saturation percentage and pH of the topsoil were lowest during the fallow period. On the other hand, effective cation exchange capacity was high in the middle of the fallow period owing to a high value of <b>exchange</b> <b>acidity.</b> Exchangeable calcium was noticeably abundant in both the topsoil and the 15 20 cm soil layer in the long fallow forest. After burning the plant debris, no rise of pH value measured in de-ionized water was recognized. From the preceding results, it can be concluded that some properties of the topsoil in fallows far less than ten years after garden abandonment are less favorable for swiddening even when the beneficial effects of heating and adding ash are taken into account. Furthermore, the present investigation suggests that the ecological characteristics of swiddening in an ever-humid region are substantially different from those in a region with humid and distinctly dry seasons...|$|E

Sediment samples from ﬂoodplains containing coastal lowland acid sulfate soils (CLASS) in eastern Australia were subjected to increasing seawater concentration to examine the probable effects of sea level rise on acidity and metal desorption. Ten soils were mixed with synthetic seawater concentrations varying from 0 % to 100 % at a solid:solution ratio of 1 : 10 for 4 h. There was a slight decrease in pH (≈ 0. 5 units) with increasing seawater concentration following treatment, yet, calculated acidity increased signiﬁcantly. In most soil treatments, Al was the dominant component of the calculated acidity pool. Al dominated the exchange complex in the CLASS and, correspondingly, was the major metal ion desorbed. In general, concentrations of soluble and exchangeable Al, Fe 2 +, Ni, Mn and Zn in all soil extracts increased with increasing salinity. Increasing trace metal concentrations with increasing seawater concentration is attributed to the combined effects of <b>exchange</b> processes and <b>acidity.</b> The increasing ionic strength of the seawater treatments displaces trace metals and protons adsorbed on sediments, causing an initial decrease in pH. Hydrolysis of desorbed acidic metal cations can further contribute to acidity and increase mobilisation of trace metals.

40|$|Of central {{importance}} in chemistry and biology, enolate chemistry {{is an attractive}} topic to elaborate on possible contributions of anion–π interactions to catalysis. To demonstrate {{the existence of such}} contributions, experimental evidence for the stabilization of not only anions but also anionic intermediates and transition states on π-acidic aromatic surfaces is decisive. To tackle this challenge for enolate chemistry with maximal precision and minimal uncertainty, malonate dilactones are covalently positioned on the π-acidic surface of naphthalenediimides (NDIs). Their presence is directly visible in the upfield shifts of the α-protons in the 1 H NMR spectra. The reactivity of these protons on π-acidic surfaces is measured by hydrogen–deuterium (H–D) exchange for 11 different examples, excluding controls. The velocity of H–D exchange increases with π acidity (NDI core substituents: SO 2 R>SOR>H>OR>OR/NR 2 >SR>NR 2). The H–D exchange kinetics vary with the structure of the enolate (malonates>methylmalonates, dilactones>dithiolactones). Moreover, they depend on the distance to the π surface (bridge length: 11 – 13 atoms). Most importantly, H–D exchange depends strongly on the chirality of the π surface (chiral sulfoxides as core substituents; the crystal structure of the enantiopure (R,R,P) -macrocycle is reported). For maximal π acidity, transition-state stabilizations up to − 18. 8  kJ[*]mol− 1 are obtained for H–D <b>exchange.</b> The Brønsted <b>acidity</b> of the enols increases strongly with π acidity of the aromatic surface, the lowest measured pKa= 10. 9 calculates to a ΔpKa=− 5. 5. Corresponding to the deprotonation of arginine residues in neutral water, considered as “impossible” in biology, the found enolate–π interactions are very important. The strong dependence of enolate stabilization on the unprecedented seven-component π-acidity gradient over almost 1  eV demonstrates quantitatively that such important anion–π activities can be expected only from strong enough π acids...|$|R

The research was conducted in a continuous cropped arable experimental plots located at the University of Uyo Teaching and Research Farm (UUTRF), Use-Offot, Uyo, Nigeria for four growing seasons, between March, 2010 to October, 2011. Core and bulk samples from the burned and adjacent unburned plots (control) were collected for physico-chemical analysis using standard procedures. These induced temperatures were highly variable on the soil surface. Temperature differences significantly (P < 0. 05) affected sand, total nitrogen, organic carbon and pH contents of the soils positively (r = 0. 518, 0. 478, 0. 582, 0. 595 respectively), whereas a reduction in the soil temperature increased the concentrations of clay, 1 mm, 0. 05 mm and 0. 25 mm stable soil aggregates in the soil (r = - 0. 619, - 0. 578, - 0. 780, - 0. 526 respectively) after burning. <b>Exchange</b> <b>acidity</b> increased to 5. 12 cmolkg- 1 at 400 C from 0. 80 cmolkg- 1 at initial temperature of 250 C at the surface soil.

40|$|The pH {{study of}} artificially {{prepared}} soils having {{at the same}} time exchangeable Na and H in the soil colloidal complex, showed that these soil samples have an acid to slight alkaline reaction (pH = 4. 8 - 8. 3), unlike native soils (without exchangeable H), that have a high alkaline re-action (pH = 8. 5 - 10. 0). For these base unsaturated soils the following relation is valid: Ph =- 0. 0005 VNa 2 + 0. 0931 VNa+ 4. 4581. This equation shows that pH values in the acid-neutral domain are maintained even for very high percentage of exchangeable Na. The multiple rela-tion between pH on one part and V and VNa on the other is the following: pH = 0. 026 V + 0. 033 VNa + 4. 20; an increase of VNa with 10 % corresponds to an increase with 0. 33 pH units and an increase of V with 10 % (or decrease of VH with 10 %) corresponds to an increase of 0. 26 pH units. The pKs calculated from the last equation is about 5. 50. In the case of saturated soils having different degree of exchangeable sodium, the relation for pH-VNa is: pH = 0. 031 VNa + 8. 58; one can see that an increase of VNa with 10 % results in a pH increase with 0. 31 units, very close to that of base unsaturated soil. The soils polluted with brines can have a more acid reaction than the reaction of the soil samples presented in the paper, due to the pres-ence of NaCl (<b>exchange</b> <b>acidity</b> in unsaturated soils or especially saline effect in saturated soils).

For TDB derivatization in H 2 O reaction media, almost pure BiD 3 and SbD 3 were always obtained for Bi(III) and Sb(III). Nearly pure AsD 3 could be obtained only under some reaction conditions. In general, for As(III), the isotopic composition of the arsines depends strongly on reaction conditions and included all possible AsHnD 32 ̆ 212 n from almost pure AsD 3 to almost pure AsH 3. For Ge(IV) and Sn(IV), the isotopic composition of generated GeHnD 42 ̆ 212 n and SnHnD 42 ̆ 212 n depends on reaction conditions, but pure GeD 4 and SnD 4 could never be obtained.

D 2 ̆ 013 H exchange in TDB during acid hydrolysis appears to occur to a limited extent.

40|$|Irregular pagination: missing p. 210 New Zealand's {{agricultural}} production systems are {{based largely on}} legume-based pastures which require a high soil phosphorus (P) status to achieve optimum production. Although application of P fertilisers undoubtedly leads to increased {{agricultural production}} and a direct economic benefit to New Zealand, concerns are growing about possible harmful side effects of long-term application of high rates of P fertilisers. These side effects can arise through contaminants contained in the fertilisers and through the direct or indirect effects of the P fertilisers on soil acidity. The general objective {{of the present study}} was to investigate the effect of long-term application of P fertilisers on soil acidity and aluminium (Al) phytotoxicity. Particular emphasis was placed on the possible role of fluoride (F), contained in the fertilisers as a contaminant, on the chemistry and phytotoxicity of soil Al. A field study was carried out to investigate the effects of long-term annual applications of six types of P fertilisers on soil acidity under legume-based pastures. The results from this study indicated that in a marginally acidic soil (pH(H 2 O) 5. 4 - 5. 8), irrespective of the rate or form of P fertiliser used, the soil became increasingly acidic over a period of seven years. However, the rate of acidification varied with the type of P fertiliser used. By year 8, the application of North Carolina phosphate rock (NCPR) gave higher pH, exchangeable Ca and Ca saturation but significantly lowered exchangeable and soluble Al than the control plots. In contrast, diammonium phosphate (DAP) application gave significantly lower soil pH, exchangeable Ca and Ca saturation and increased soluble Al and <b>exchange</b> <b>acidity.</b> In comparison to the control plots, single superphosphate (SSP) in general had similar soil pH and exchangeable Al but increased exchangeable Ca and Ca saturation at higher rates of application. The results suggested that continuous use of certain reactive phosphate rocks such as NCPR can significantly slow down the rate of acidification of pastoral soils. Using the same field trial, changes in soil solution composition and Al speciation were investigated. Application of DAP and high rates of SSP increased total Al concentrations in the soil solution even though SSP had no effect on soil pH. The increased Al concentration in the SSP treatments could be due to high concentrations of F (added as a contaminant in the fertilisers) complexing Al, and hence bringing more Al into the soil solution. Application of NCPR decreased total Al concentrations, presumably by increasing pH. Application of DAP increased the predicted concentrations of toxic Al species- Al 3 +, Al(OH) 2 +, Al(OH) 2 1 +. In contrast application of SSP decreased the toxic Al concentration, despite higher solution Al concentration compared with control treatment. The concentration of toxic Al species in NCPR-treated soil was also lower than in the control treatment. A short-term bioassay was carried out using barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) to study the effects of long-term (20 years) inputs of Ca, F, and sulphate (SO 4) from P fertilisers and changes in soil pH on Al phytotoxicity. Results of this glasshouse experiment showed that the relationships between soil Al indices and barley root growth were different for soils with different P fertiliser history. The inability of total monomeric Al, and 0. 02 M CaCl 2 -extractable Al to explain the variation in root growth in the combined data for fertilised and unfertilised soils indicated that the relative proportions of the phytotoxic Al were different for fertilised and unfertilised soils. These differences were due to the higher proportions of the less-toxic Al-F complexes in the fertilised soil and also due to the high concentrations of Ca in the soil solution. The ability of the activity ratio of Al 3 +/Ca 2 + to predict Al toxicity most consistently across soils with different P fertiliser histories indicated that soil solution Ca should be taken into account together with toxic Al species in the assessment of Al phytotoxicity. A short-term bioassay was carried out to develop a chemical test to predict the potential toxicity of Al for early root growth in widely different soil types. The results from this study showed that, in soils with similar physical properties, mineralogy and low organic matter content, short time pyrocatecol violet (PCV) -Al determination in soil solution can be used as a simple and reliable method to predict Al toxicity. However, the direct use of short-time colorimetric procedures to predict critical Al toxicity levels for different soil types could be limited by the variations in organic Al and other factors such as ionic strength, cation and anion types and concentrations. Among the Al toxicity indices studied, as observed in the trial with similar parent materials, the activity ratio of Al 3 +/Ca 2 + is again the best predictor of Al toxicity but now in widely different soil types. The interactive effects of soil acidity and F were also studied using the short-term bioassay method. Increasing rates of F additions to soil significantly increased the soil solution concentrations of Al and F irrespective of the initial soil pH. However, the rate of increase was much higher at low pH than at high pH. There was a significant interaction between soil acidity and F on root growth of barley. High rates of F addition severely reduced root growth and the effect was more pronounced in the strongly acidic soil. Speciation calculations predicted that increasing rates of F additions increased Al-F complexes in the soil solution. Results also indicated that Al-F complexes are not toxic at lower concentrations but they are toxic at high concentrations and the relative toxicity depended on the type of Al-F complexes present. Results from this study suggest that it is unlikely that in a marginally acidic soil (pH (H 2 O) 5. 4 - 5. 8) long-term F inputs via P fertilisers will have any detrimental effects on plant growth. Rather it will reduce the free Al concentration while keeping the Al-F species concentration below the toxic threshold level in the soil solution, thereby reducing the occurrence of Al phototoxicity...|$|E
