5|$|After {{returning}} from Italy, No. 3 Commando {{became part of}} the 1st Special Service Brigade, commanded by Brigadier The Lord Lovat. It marked the end of the unit's independence, as from then {{they were part of a}} larger organisation, and the role of the Commandos <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> from small scale raiding and precision operations, to more large scale operations in which they were mainly used as highly trained infantry assault units.|$|E
5|$|As the Watergate saga unfolded, the ACLU {{became the}} first {{national}} organization to call for Nixon's impeachment. This, following the resolution opposing the Vietnam war, was a second major decision that caused critics of the ACLU, particularly conservatives, {{to claim that the}} ACLU <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> into a liberal political organization.|$|E
5|$|During evolution, darts {{appear to}} have been lost secondarily, i.e., after they <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> and been functional. Vestigial darts (ones that exist only in a {{rudimentary}} condition) occur in the family Sagdidae, and in many Helicoidea, the surrounding organs have also degenerated (become non-functional). The sarcobelum is a fleshy or cuticle-coated papilla which {{is considered to be a}} degenerated, previously dart-bearing, organ.|$|E
50|$|In some dialects vowels {{interrupted}} by stop <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> into individual phonemes themselves, {{for example in}} Todos Santos dialect/oʔ/ represented by o' <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> into /ɵʏˀ/ and /oʔo/ represented by o'o <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> into /ɵ'ʉ/.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} animals <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> aerial locomotion, either by powered flight or by gliding. Flying and gliding animals (volant animals) <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> {{separately}} many times, without any single ancestor. Flight <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> at least four times, in the insects, pterosaurs, birds, and bats. Gliding <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> on many more occasions. Usually the development is to aid canopy animals in getting from tree to tree, although there are other possibilities. Gliding, in particular, <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> among rainforest animals, especially in the rainforests in Asia (most especially Borneo) where the trees are tall and widely spaced. Several species of aquatic animals, and a few amphibians <b>have</b> also <b>evolved</b> to acquire this gliding flight ability, typically {{as a means of}} evading predators.|$|R

5|$|In the 19th century, {{particularly}} {{after the publication}} of On the Origin of Species in 1859, the idea that life <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> was an active source of academic debate centred on the philosophical, social and religious implications of evolution. Today, the modern evolutionary synthesis is accepted by a vast majority of scientists. However, evolution remains a contentious concept for some theists.|$|E
5|$|Land warfare {{changed from}} the static front lines of World WarI to {{increased}} mobility and combined arms. The tank, which had been used predominantly for infantry support in the First World War, <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> into the primary weapon. In the late 1930s, tank design was considerably more advanced {{than it had been}} during World War I, and advances continued throughout the war with increases in speed, armour and firepower.|$|E
5|$|Many Aboriginal civilizations {{established}} {{characteristics and}} hallmarks that included permanent urban settlements or cities, agriculture, civic and monumental architecture, and complex societal hierarchies. These cultures <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> and {{changed by the}} time of the first permanent European arrivals (c. late 15th–early 16th centuries), and have been brought forward through archaeological investigations.|$|E

25|$|Korean cuisine <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> through {{centuries of}} social and {{political}} change. Originating from ancient agricultural and nomadic traditions in the Korean peninsula and southern Manchuria, Korean cuisine <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> through a complex interaction of the natural environment and different cultural trends.|$|R
5|$|Once safely {{established}} on Madagascar, with its limited mammalian population, the lemurs were {{protected from the}} increasing competition from evolving arboreal mammalian groups. Monkeys <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> by the Oligocene, and their intelligence, aggression, and deceptiveness may have given them the advantage in exploiting the environment over the diurnal adapiform primates in Africa and Asia, ultimately driving them to extinction and leaving only the nocturnal lorisoids.|$|E
5|$|Rajasaurus {{is known}} {{only from the}} Indian Peninsula. At {{the time it was}} alive, the Indian landmass had {{recently}} separated from the rest of Gondwana and was moving north. While Rajasaurus <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> along its own direction, it was still similar to other abelisaurids such as Majungasaurus from Madagascar and Carnotaurus from South America; these animals descended from a common lineage.|$|E
5|$|Recent {{analyses}} {{suggest that}} vampire bats arose from insectivores, which discount the frugivore, carnivore, and nectarivore hypotheses of origin. Within 4 million years of diverging from other Phyllostomids, vampire bats <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> all necessary adaptations for blood-feeding, {{making it one}} of the fastest examples of natural selection among mammals.|$|E
50|$|The current {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of the first living organisms is that these were some form of prokaryotes, which may <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> out of protocells. In general, the eukaryotes are thought to <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> later in the history of life.|$|R
5000|$|Given {{the ancient}} origin of most {{vertebrate}} organs, researchers have looked for model systems, where organs <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> more recently, and ideally <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> multiple times independently. An outstanding model {{for this kind}} of research is the placenta, which <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> more than 100 times independently in vertebrates, <b>has</b> <b>evolved</b> relatively recently in some lineages, and exists in intermediate forms in extant taxa. Studies on the evolution of the placenta have identified a variety of genetic and physiological processes that contribute to the origin and evolution of organs, these include the re-purposing of existing animal tissues, the acquiring of new functional properties to these tissues, and the novel interaction of distinct tissue types.|$|R
50|$|Cretolamna is {{believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> into the genus Otodus sometime in the Paleocene. Otodus {{is believed}} to <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> later into the Carcharocles genus. Others believe that Cretolamna evolved into the Paleocene shark Palaeocarcharodon, which some think evolved into Carcharodon carcharias.|$|R
5|$|Silverchair's {{alternative}} rock sound <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> {{throughout their}} career, differing styles on specific albums steadily growing more ambitious over the years, from grunge on their debut to more recent work displaying orchestral and art rock influences. The songwriting and singing of Johns <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> steadily while the band had developed an increased element of complexity. In 2003, following {{the release of}} Diorama, the band announced a , during which time members recorded with side projects The Dissociatives, The Mess Hall, and Tambalane. Silverchair were reunited at the 2005 Wave Aid concerts. In 2007, they released their fifth album, Young Modern, and played the Across the Great Divide tour with contemporaries Powderfinger. In May 2011, Silverchair announced an indefinite hiatus, having sold 8 million albums worldwide.|$|E
5|$|The {{idea that}} venom {{had a single}} {{evolutionary}} origin has been called into question by a 2015 study, which found that venom proteins had homologs in many other tissues in the Burmese python. The study therefore suggested that venom <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> independently {{in a number of}} snake lineages.|$|E
5|$|Ticks {{are small}} arachnids, {{part of the}} order Parasitiformes. Along with mites, they {{constitute}} the subclass Acari. Ticks are ectoparasites (external parasites), living by feeding on the blood of mammals, birds, and sometimes reptiles and amphibians. Ticks <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> by the Cretaceous period, {{the most common form}} of fossilisation being immersed in amber. Ticks are widely distributed around the world, especially in warm, humid climates.|$|E
50|$|The family Polydnaviridae may <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> {{from the}} Ascoviridae. Molecular {{evidence}} suggests that the Phycodnaviridae may <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> from the family Iridoviridae. These four families (Ascoviridae, Iridoviridae, Phycodnaviridae and Polydnaviridae) may form a clade but more work is needed to confirm this.|$|R

5|$|Under American protection, Iraqi Kurdistan <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> into a {{successful}} semi-autonomous region. US pressure helped {{lead to a}} peace deal in 1999 between the major Iraqi Kurdish factions, the Patriotic Union of Kurdistan and the Kurdistan Democratic Party of Iraq. While both parties officially swore off independence, the Turkish government remained sufficiently concerned, and continued to keep troops in northern Iraq.|$|E
5|$|As a {{candidate}} for the Illinois state senate in 1996, Obama had said that he favored legalizing same-sex marriage. By the time of his Senate run in 2004, he said that he supported civil unions and domestic partnerships for same-sex partners, but he opposed same-sex marriages for strategic reasons. On May 9, 2012, shortly after the official launch of his campaign for re-election as president, Obama said his views <b>had</b> <b>evolved,</b> and he publicly affirmed his personal support for the legalization of same-sex marriage, becoming the first sitting U.S. president to do so.|$|E
5|$|As a result, the {{memorial}} stone became {{the memorial}} itself. The monument was later {{moved by the}} authorities {{to make way for}} the gentrification of the Fullerton Building, and was relocated to the National Archives of Singapore, where it stands almost forgotten today. The authorities hope that when Singapore's community of values <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> to the point that a common language of art could be used to complete the task of building such a monument again.|$|E
500|$|Cellular origin theory : Some viruses may <b>have</b> <b>evolved</b> from bits of DNA or RNA that [...] "escaped" [...] {{from the}} genes of a larger organism.

5|$|Birds are now {{recognized}} {{as being the}} sole surviving lineage of theropod dinosaurs. In traditional taxonomy, birds were considered a separate class that <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> from dinosaurs, a distinct superorder. However, a majority of contemporary paleontologists concerned with dinosaurs reject the traditional style of classification in favor of phylogenetic taxonomy; this approach requires that, for a group to be natural, all descendants {{of members of the}} group must be included in the group as well. Birds are thus considered to be dinosaurs and dinosaurs are, therefore, not extinct. Birds are classified as belonging to the subgroup Maniraptora, which are coelurosaurs, which are theropods, which are saurischians, which are dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{most of the}} {{differences}} between politicians in occupied Poland and those in exile had been positively settled. By 1943, the PKP <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> into the Home Political Representation (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna, KRP), which served as the basis of the Council of National Unity (Rada Jedności Narodowej, RJN), created on 9 January 1944. The Council, headed by Kazimierz Pużak, was seen as the Underground State's parliament. Meanwhile, the military arm of the Underground State expanded dramatically, and the ZWZ was transformed into Armia Krajowa (AK, or the Home Army) in 1942. ZWZ-AK commanders included Stefan Rowecki, Tadeusz Komorowski and Leopold Okulicki.|$|E
5|$|By the 19th century, Victorian {{scholars}} such as William Stubbs, James Ramsay, and William Hunt {{sought to}} understand how the English political system <b>had</b> <b>evolved</b> under Henry. They explored the emergence of Parliamentary institutions during his reign, and sympathized with the concerns of the chroniclers over the role of the Poitevins in England. This focus carried on into early 20th-century research into Henry, such as Kate Norgate's 1913 volume, which continued to make heavy use of the chronicler accounts and focused primarily on constitutional issues, with a distinctive nationalistic bias.|$|E
