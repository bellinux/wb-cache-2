60|$|Lor. Take your rebel back again, father mine: The beaten {{party are}} rebels to the conquerors. I {{have been at}} <b>hard-head</b> with your butting citizens; I have routed your herd; I have {{dispersed}} them; {{and now they are}} retreated quietly, from their extraordinary vocation of fighting in the streets, to their ordinary vocation of cozening in their shops.|$|E
60|$|It {{was very}} like a revelation {{to them when}} the hospitable Captain {{explained}} that there were several grades of each variety of sheep-wool, white-reef, dark-reef, abaco, velvet, grass, boat, <b>hard-head,</b> yellow and glove sponges, all worth from five to ten cents per pound by the quantity; and, also, that when first taken from the water a sponge is useless for mechanical or domestic purposes.|$|E
60|$|The descent was a malevoie, over slabs and boulders, loose {{stones and}} clayey ground, {{slippery}} as ice after rain. The moleques descended like chamois within twenty minutes: Selim and I, with booted feet, took double the time, but on return we ascended it in forty-five minutes. Viewed from below, the base rests upon cliffs of gneiss, with debris and quartz in masses, bands and pebbles, pure and impure, white and rusty. Upon it rises a stratum of ferruginous clay, with large <b>hard-heads</b> of granite, gneiss, and schist, blocks of conglomerate, and nodules of ironstone. Higher {{still is the}} bank of yellow clay, capped with shallow humus. The waving profile is backed by steep hills, with rocky sides and long ridges of ground, {{the site of the}} palm- hidden Banzas.|$|R
5000|$|Roger Greenspun, {{the film}} critic for The New York Times, gave the film a mixed review, and wrote, [...] "The picture {{initially}} portends sensationalism, with the racial scales reversed and the well-behaved white youngsters harassed and tormented {{by the black}} students. What steadies {{the whole thing is}} the excellent performance of Calvin Lockhart, as a sane, realistic Negro teacher who more or less holds together the teeming school and the picture itself...But the picture's urgent plea for racial sanity in the classroom is almost methodically blunted by the use of standard-seeming types. The few faculty whites are oafs or <b>hard-heads.</b> There is the pretty Negro teacher, nicely played by Janet MacLachlan, who supports and comforts Lockhart. As the fieriest black student and the spunkiest white newcomer, James A. Watson Jr. and Jeff Bridges do well in characterizations that rate more exploration." ...|$|R
60|$|October 16.--A {{letter from}} Walter with better news. He {{has been at}} <b>hard-heads</b> with the rogues and come off with advantage; in short, practised with success the art of drawing two souls out of one weaver.[470] All seems quiet now, and I suppose the Major will get his leave as {{proposed}}. Two ladies--[one] Byron's Mary Chaworth--have been frightened to death while the mob tore the dying creatures from their beds and proposed to throw them into the flames, drank the wine, destroyed the furniture, and committed other excesses of a jacquerie.[471] They have been put down, however, by a strong force of yeomanry and regulars. Walter says the soldiers fired over the people's heads, whereas if they had levelled low, the bullets must have told more among the multitude. I cannot approve of this, for in such cases severity is ultimate mercy.[472] However, if {{they have made a}} sufficient impression to be striking--why, enough is as good as a feast.|$|R
6000|$|The sea at {{this hour}} is smooth as oil, except where ruffled by fish-shoals, and shows {{comparatively}} free, today at least, from the long Atlantic roll which lashes the flat coast east of Apollonia. Its selvage is fretted by green points, golden sands, and a red cove not unlike the crater-port of Clarence, Fernando Po. The surface is broken by two islets, apparently the terminal knobs of many reefs which project westward from the land. To the north rises Asiniba ('Son of Asini'), a pyramid of rock below and tree-growth above. Fronting the landing-place is Bobowus√∫a, [Footnote: The Hyd. Chart calls them Suaba and Bobowassi; {{it might be a}} trifle more curious in the matter of significant words.] or Fetish Island, a double feature which we shall presently inspect. The foreshore is barred and dotted perpendicularly by black reefs and scattered diabolitos, or detached <b>hard-heads,</b> which break the surges. At spring-tides, when rise and fall reach at least ten feet, and fourteen in the equinoctial ebb and flow, it appears a gridiron of grim black stone. [Footnote: Not as the Hyd. Chart says--'rise and fall at springs six or seven feet.'] ...|$|R
6000|$|The Portuguese, from whose {{relation}} we {{have the}} knowledge of what is above written, and who {{was present at the}} dispute, as he himself informs us, in his book of Travels, gives us no account of the answers which were made by Xavier. [...] "I have neither knowledge nor presumption enough," [...] says he, [...] "to relate those subtile and solid reasons, with which he confuted the mad imaginations of the Bonza." [...] We only have learnt from this Portuguese, that Fucarandono was put to silence upon the point in question, and that, a little to save his reputation, he changed the subject, but to no purpose, for even there too he was confounded; for, forgetting those decencies which even nature prescribes to men, and common custom has taught us in civil conversation, he advanced infamous propositions, which cannot be related without offending modesty; and these he maintained with a strange impudence, against the reasons of the Father, though the king and the noble auditory thought the Christian arguments convincing. But the Bonza still flying out into passion, and continuing to rail and bawl aloud, as if he were rather in a bear-garden than at a solemn disputation, one of the lords there present said, smiling, to him, [...] "If your business be fighting, why did not you go to the kingdom of Amanguchi, when they were in civil wars? there you might have found some one or other with whom you might have gone to <b>hard-heads.</b> What make you here, where all things are at quiet? But, if you came hither to dispute, why do you not carry on your argument with mildness and good manners, according to the copy which is set you by the European Bonza?" ...|$|R
60|$|Now, Susan, for a sober {{picture of}} our village. It {{was a small}} {{collection}} of dwellings {{that seemed to have}} been cast up by the sea with the rock-weed and marine plants that it vomits after a storm, or to have come ashore among the pipe-staves and other lumber which had been washed from the deck of an Eastern schooner. There was just space for the narrow and sandy street between the beach in front and a precipitous hill that lifted its rocky forehead in the rear among a waste of juniper-bushes and the wild growth of a broken pasture. The village was picturesque in the variety of its edifices, though all were rude. Here stood a little old hovel, built, perhaps, of driftwood, there a row of boat-houses, and beyond them a two-story dwelling of dark and weatherbeaten aspect, the whole intermixed with one or two snug cottages painted white, a sufficiency of pig-styes and a shoemaker's shop. Two grocery stores stood opposite each other in the centre of the village. These were the places of resort at their idle hours of a hardy throng of fishermen in red baize shirts, oilcloth trousers and boots of brown leather covering the whole leg--true seven-league boots, but fitter to wade the ocean than walk the earth. The wearers seemed amphibious, as if they did but creep out of salt water to sun themselves; nor would it have been wonderful to see their lower limbs covered with clusters of little shellfish such as cling to rocks and old ship-timber over which the tide ebbs and flows. When their fleet of boats was weather-bound, the butchers raised their price, and the spit was busier than the frying-pan; for this was a place of fish, and known as such to all the country round about. The very air was fishy, being perfumed with dead sculpins, <b>hard-heads</b> and dogfish strewn plentifully on the beach.--You see, children, the village is but little changed since your mother and I were young.|$|R
