40|$|Abstract. Why do {{more educated}} workers {{experience}} lower unemployment rates and lower employment volatility? A {{closer look at}} the data reveals that these workers have similar <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rates,</b> but much lower and less volatile separation rates than their less educated colleagues. We argue that on-the-job training, being complementary to formal education, is the reason for this pattern. Using a search and matching model with endogenous separations, we show that investments in match-specific human capital reduce the outside option of workers, implying less incentives to separate and thus longer job spells. The model generates unemployment dynamics that are consistent with the observed patterns for unemployment, separation and <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rates</b> across education groups...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we aim to}} {{shed light}} on the {{relative}} contribution of the separation and job finding rates to French unemployment at business cycle frequencies by using administrative data on registered unemployment and labor force surveys.

Our results show the dominant role of the <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rate</b> in accounting for French unemployment fluctuations. The contribution of the <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rate</b> amounts to about two-thirds of the unemployment dynamics. With the two data sets, we find that both rates contributed to unemployment fluctuations during the nineties, while the <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rate</b> has been more significant in the last decade.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} the behaviour of Australian {{labour market}} transition rates. Since the early 1980 s the <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rate</b> has been significantly more volatile and pro-cyclical than the job loss rate and is strongly pro-cyclical. The economic downturns {{in the early}} 1980 s and early 1990 s were associated with an up to 10 percentage point decline in the average <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rate.</b> In comparison, the recent economic downturn {{was associated with a}} less significant decline in the <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rate.</b> During these periods the job loss rate has shown less significant volatility. The findings of this paper suggest job search activities of workers are potentially more relevant in explaining the volatility of labour market variables such as the unemployment rate and whether emerging skills shortages can be addressed. Moreover, policies that assist job search and skills development of workers are important, as is the search intensity of workers. ...|$|E
40|$|We use a novel {{approach}} to studying the heterogeneity in the <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rates</b> of the nonemployed by classifying the nonemployed by labor force status (LFS) histories, instead of using only one-month LFS. <b>Job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rates</b> differ substantially across LFS histories: they are 25 - 30 % among those currently out {{of the labor force}} (OLF) with recent employment, 10 % among those currently OLF who have been unemployed but not employed in the previous two months, and 2 % among those who have been OLF in all three previous months.

There are considerable differences instead for what concerns job market flows, with fiscal consolidation in high-EPL countries having a much less strong impact on job destruction but also leading to a more pronounced reduction in <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rates</b> and, therefore, to a higher share of long-term unemployment. Such results apply to EPL for regular contracts, while countries with low EPL for temporary contracts simply exhibit a higher unemployment response to consolidation associated to increased job separation flows, with no significant difference for what concerns <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rates</b> and long-term unemployment.|$|R

After validating the model both internally and externally, we conclude that the scheme is effective in raising the <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rate</b> with minor wage losses.

In addition, we allow for arbitrary parameter heterogeneity across workers, so dynamic selection also affects the average <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rate</b> at different durations. We show that our model has testable implications if we observe at least two completed non-employment spells for each worker. Moreover, we can identify the distribution of a subset of our model’s parameters using data on the duration of repeated non-employment spells and use the estimated parameters to understand the determinants of duration dependence. We use a large panel of social security data for Austrian workers to test and estimate the model. Our model is not rejected by the data.

Difference-in-difference exercises for a regulation change in 1990 indicate that higher firing costs lowered turnover rates of small firms.

My approach traces not only responses of transition rates and vacancies but also those of gross job losses and hires and thereby the stock of unemployment in one unified framework. I find that when a negative shock occurs, (i) both the job loss rate and gross job losses rise quickly and remain persistently high, (ii) the <b>job</b> <b>finding</b> <b>rate</b> and vacancies drop in a hump-shaped manner, and (iii) gross hires respond little initially, but eventually rise.
