50|$|A {{suppressor}} {{screen is}} used to identify suppressor mutations which alleviate or revert the phenotype of the original mutation, in a process defined as synthetic viability. Suppressor mutations {{can be described as}} second mutations at a site on the chromosome distinct from the mutation under study, which suppress the phenotype of the original mutation. If the mutation is in the same gene as the original mutation it is known as intragenic suppression, whereas a mutation located in a different gene is known as extragenic suppression or <b>intergenic</b> <b>suppression.</b> Suppressor mutations are extremely useful to define the functions of biochemical pathways within a cell and the relationships between different biochemical pathways.|$|E
5000|$|Intergenic (also {{known as}} extragenic) {{suppression}} relieves {{the effects of}} a mutation in one gene by a mutation somewhere else within the genome. The second mutation is not on the same gene as the original mutation. [...] <b>Intergenic</b> <b>suppression</b> is useful for identifying and studying interactions between molecules, such as proteins. For example, a mutation which disrupts the complementary interaction between protein molecules may be compensated for by a second mutation elsewhere in the genome that restores or provides a suitable alternative interaction between those molecules. Several proteins of biochemical, signal transduction, and gene expression pathways have been identified using this approach. Examples of such pathways include receptor-ligand interactions as well as the interaction of components involved in DNA replication, transcription, and translation.|$|E
40|$|Tn 4001, a 4. 5 -kilobase {{composite}} transposon with IS 256 ends that confers resistance to gentamicin (Gmr), tobramycin, and kanamycin in Staphylococcus aureus, can transpose to diverse chromosomal sites in S. aureus. Chromosomal insertions of Tn 4001 were isolated either after UV irradiation of transducing lysates carrying pII 147 ::Tn 4001 or by selection for thermoresistant Gmr isolates with strains containing thermosensitive derivatives of plasmids pI 258 and pII 147 carrying Tn 4001. Frequent {{integration of the}} entire delivery plasmid occurred under these selective conditions in recombination-proficient hosts. When selection for thermoresistant Gmr isolates was done with these plasmids in recombination-deficient hosts, 99 % {{or more of the}} Gmr isolates resulted from transposition of Tn 4001 in the absence of plasmid integration. Efficient isolation of Tn 4001 insertions near markers of interest and the isolation of insertional auxotrophs were achieved. Reversion frequencies of insertional auxotrophs were between 10 (- 6) and 10 (- 7) (higher than those observed with Tn 551 and Tn 917). About 50 % of the prototrophic revertants were Gms, and these are attributed to precise excision of Tn 4001. The Gmr prototrophic revertants were due to <b>intergenic</b> <b>suppression...</b>|$|E
40|$|Galactose-activated {{transcription}} of the Saccharomyces cerevisiae GAL genes {{occurs when}} Gal 3 binds the Gal 4 inhibitor, Gal 80. Noninteracting variants of Gal 3 or Gal 80 render the GAL genes noninducible. To identify the binding determinants for Gal 3 's interaction with Gal 80 we carried out GAL 3 –GAL 80 <b>intergenic</b> <b>suppression</b> analyses and selected for new GAL 3 mutations that impair the Gal 3 –Gal 80 interaction. We {{show that a}} GAL 3 C-D 368 V mutation can suppress the noninducibility due to a GAL 80 S- 1 -G 323 R mutation, and a GAL 80 -M 350 C mutation can suppress the noninducibility due to a gal 3 -D 111 C mutation. A reverse two-hybrid selection for GAL 3 mutations that impair the Gal 3 –Gal 80 interaction yielded 12 single-amino-acid substitutions at residues that are predicted to be surface exposed on Gal 3. The majority of the affected Gal 3 residues localized to a composite surface that includes D 111 and a sequence motif containing D 368, which has been implicated in interaction with Gal 80. The striking colocalization of intergenic suppressor residues and Gal 80 nonbinder residues identifies a Gal 3 surface that likely interacts with Gal 80...|$|E
40|$|The MS {{ring of the}} flagellar {{basal body}} of Salmonella is an {{integral}} membrane structure consisting of about 26 subunits of a 61 -kDa protein, FliF. Out of many nonflagellate fliF mutants tested, three gave rise to intergenic suppressors in flagellar region II. The pseudorevertants swarmed, though poorly; this partial recovery of motile function was shown {{to be due to}} partial recovery of export function and flagellar assembly. The three parental mutants were all found to carry the same mutation, a six-base deletion corresponding to loss of Ala- 174 and Ser- 175 in the predicted periplasmic domain of the FliF protein. The 19 intergenic suppressors identified all lay in flhA, and they consisted of 10 independent examples at the nucleotide level or 9 at the amino acid level. Since two of the nine corresponded to different substitutions at the same amino acid position, only eight positions in the FlhA protein have given rise to suppressors. Thus, FliF-FlhA <b>intergenic</b> <b>suppression</b> is a fairly rare event. FlhA is a component of the flagellar protein export apparatus, with an integral membrane domain encompassing the N-terminal half of the sequence and a cytoplasmic C-terminal domain. All of the suppressing mutations lay within the integral membrane domain. These mutations, when placed in a wild-type fliF background, had no mutant phenotype. In the fliF mutant background, mutant FlhA was dominant, yielding a pseudorevertant phenotype. Wild-type FlhA did not exert significant negative dominance in the pseudorevertant background, indicating that it does not compete effectively with mutant FlhA for interaction with mutant FliF. Mutant FliF was partially dominant over wild-type FliF in both the wild-type and second-site FlhA backgrounds. Membrane fractionation experiments indicated that the fliF mutation, though preventing export, was mild enough to permit assembly of the MS ring itself, and also assembly of the cytoplasmic C ring onto the MS ring. The data from this study provide genetic support for a model in which at least the FlhA component of the export apparatus physically interacts with the MS ring within which it is housed...|$|E
