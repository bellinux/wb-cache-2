5|$|Most {{colleges are}} led by a Master, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Master is female. However, there are some exceptions, listed below. Girton College {{has always had a}} Mistress, even though male {{candidates}} have been able to run for the office since 1976.|$|E
5|$|On {{the other}} hand, blue collar foreign workers have {{sometimes}} {{been unable to}} collect salaries due <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> Saudi Labor Office has ruled in their favor, since employers can stall payment until the worker' work permits have expired.|$|E
5|$|Sleep-and-charge USB ports {{can be used}} {{to charge}} {{electronic}} devices <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> computer is switched off. Normally, when a computer is powered off the USB ports are powered down, preventing phones and other devices from charging. Sleep-and-charge USB ports remain powered <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> computer is off. On laptops, charging devices from the USB port when it is not being powered from AC drains the laptop battery faster; most laptops have a facility to stop charging if their own battery charge level gets too low. This feature has also been implemented on some laptop docking stations allowing device charging even when no laptop is present.|$|E

5|$|This martin moults early, {{with adults}} having {{completely}} replaced their feathers by late August. Juveniles moult somewhat later, and their old primary feathers are retained <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> body has mainly adult plumage.|$|E

5|$|Adderall {{has been}} {{banned in the}} National Football League (NFL), Major League Baseball (MLB), National Basketball Association (NBA), and the National Collegiate Athletics Association (NCAA).

5|$|All IQ {{tests show}} {{variation}} in scores <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> same person takes the same test {{over and over}} again. IQ scores also differ for a test-taker taking tests {{from more than one}} publisher at the same age. The various test publishers do not use uniform names or definitions for IQ score classifications. All these issues must be kept in mind when interpreting an individual's IQ scores, because they all can result in different IQ classifications for the same person at different times.|$|E
5|$|Although {{bicycles}} and motorcycles can {{appear to be}} simple mechanisms with only four major moving parts (frame, fork, and two wheels), these parts are arranged {{in a way that}} makes them complicated to analyze. While it is an observable fact that bikes can be ridden <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> gyroscopic effects of their wheels are canceled out, the hypothesis that the gyroscopic effects of the wheels are what keep a bike upright is common in print and online.|$|E

5|$|Book of the Dead papyri {{were often}} {{the work of}} several {{different}} scribes and artists whose work was literally pasted together. It is usually possible to identify the style {{of more than one}} scribe used on a given manuscript, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> manuscript is a shorter one. The text and illustrations were produced by different scribes; {{there are a number of}} Books where the text was completed but the illustrations were left empty.|$|E
5|$|Brock had a {{successful}} pre-war military career and a quick rise through the ranks, which many commented on at the time. Some credited luck and others skill in his rapid promotions, and Brock had substantial portions of both {{on his way to}} prominence. Lacking special political connections, Brock's ability to gain promotions <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> nation was at peace attests to his skills in recruiting men and organizing finances, and ambition.|$|E
5|$|In 1666, Newton {{observed}} that the spectrum of colours exiting a prism {{in the position of}} minimum deviation is oblong, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> light ray entering the prism is circular, which is to say, the prism refracts different colours by different angles. This led him to conclude that colour is a property intrinsic to lightâ€”a point which had been debated in prior years.|$|E

5|$|Like all blackwater {{streams in}} Florida, {{the color of}} most of the St. Johns is black, owing to the tannins in leaf litter and {{decaying}} aquatic plants. Spring fed streams, on the other hand, are remarkably clear and visibility is very high, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> river bottom is dozens of feet below.|$|E
5|$|Many of Christie's stories first {{appeared}} in journals, newspapers and magazines.

5|$|Most {{extraterrestrial}} helium {{is found}} in a plasma state, with properties quite {{different from those of}} atomic helium. In a plasma, helium's electrons are not bound to its nucleus, resulting in very high electrical conductivity, <b>even</b> <b>when</b> <b>the</b> gas is only partially ionized. The charged particles are highly influenced by magnetic and electric fields. For example, in the solar wind together with ionized hydrogen, the particles interact with the Earth's magnetosphere, giving rise to Birkeland currents and the aurora.|$|E
