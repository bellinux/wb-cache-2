50|$|In {{a common}} design, {{incoming}} lines have a disconnect switch and a circuit breaker. In some cases, the lines {{will not have}} both, with either a switch or a circuit breaker being all that is considered necessary. A disconnect switch is used to provide isolation, since it cannot interrupt load current. A circuit breaker {{is used as a}} protection device to interrupt fault currents automatically, and may be used to switch loads on and off, or to cut off a line when power is flowing in the 'wrong' direction. When a large fault current flows through the circuit breaker, this is detected through the use of current transformers. The magnitude of the current transformer outputs may be used to trip the circuit breaker resulting in a disconnection of the load supplied by the circuit break from the <b>feeding</b> <b>point.</b> This seeks to isolate the fault point {{from the rest of the}} system, and allow the rest of the system to continue operating with minimal impact.

When mature, the insect remains stationary, attaches {{itself to the}} plant by waxy secretions, and produces a white egg sac in grooves, by extrusion, in the body which encases hundreds of red eggs. The egg sac will grow to be {{two to three times}} as long as the body. Newly hatched nymphs are the primary dispersal stage, with dispersion known to occur by wind and by crawling. Early stage nymphs feed from the midrib veins of leaves and small twigs, and do the bulk of the damage.

Unlike many other scale insects, they retain legs and a limited mobility in all life stages. Older nymphs migrate to larger twigs and eventually as adults to branches and the trunk. Their life cycle is highly temperature dependent, as the length of time in each stage of life is longer in cold temperatures than high temperatures.|$|E

40|$|A novel {{technique}} and a nonthermal soldering method {{to improve the}} performance of AgHT- 8 transparent polymer antennas are proposed in this letter.

40|$|The main {{objective}} of many conservation programs {{is to increase}} population size by improving a species' survival and reproduction. However, density dependence of demographic parameters may confound this approach. In this study we used a 25 -year data set on Bearded Vultures (Gypaetus barbatus) in Spain to evaluate the consequences of population growth on reproductive performance. Unlike its coefficient of variation (CV), mean annual productivity decreased with increasing population size. After controlling for territorial heterogeneity, productivity also was negatively related to {{the distance to the}} nearest conspecific breeding pair and to supplementary <b>feeding</b> <b>points</b> where floaters congregate. These results suggest that vulture populations are regulated as posited by the site-dependency hypothesis: as the population increases, average productivity decreases because progressively poorer territories are used. The combined effects of the shrinkage of territories and the presence of floaters around supplementary <b>feeding</b> <b>points</b> seem to be the main causes of productivity decline and are therefore the main determinants of territory quality.
