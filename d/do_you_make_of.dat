500|$|Zappa in New York {{featured}} {{a song about}} sex criminal Michael H. Kenyon, [...] "The Illinois Enema Bandit", which featured Don Pardo providing the opening narrative in the song. Like many songs on the album, it contained numerous sexual references, leading to many critics objecting and being offended by the content. Zappa dismissed the criticism by noting {{that he was a}} journalist reporting on life as he saw it. Predating his later fight against censorship, he remarked: [...] "What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> a society that is so primitive that it clings to the belief that certain words in its language are so powerful that they could corrupt you the moment you hear them?" [...] The remaining albums released by Warner Bros. Records without Zappa's consent were Studio Tan in 1978 and Sleep Dirt and Orchestral Favorites in 1979, which contained complex suites of instrumentally-based tunes recorded between 1973 and 1976, and whose release was overlooked {{in the midst of the}} legal problems.|$|E
2500|$|Since the semi-autobiographical The 400 Blows (1959), it {{has been}} noted that Truffaut often portrayed {{personal}} experiences and emotions throughout his films. Via such expressionistic use of the medium, he proclaimed himself as a film auteur, within a theory of film as art which he personally advocated as a director and a critic. As a result, Truffaut's films often appeared to focus on certain themes and stylisations, such as the vitality of youth and childhood, particularly embodied by the character of Antoine Doinel, who is a recurring presence across {{a number of his}} films. The Green Room however was made towards the end of Truffaut's career, and thematically the film contrasts to his earlier works. The Green Room appears to reminisce on childhood, whilst focusing more on the final stages of life, as Truffaut expresses his views of death and remembrance of the dead. This theme for a film had [...] "preoccupied him for several years and had been accentuated by the deaths of numerous friends and colleagues", such as those who previously worked alongside him on Shoot the Piano Player. Nonetheless, the alternative theme of the film again reflects Truffaut's sense of personal expressionism throughout his career. When asked [...] "what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>make</b> <b>of</b> the contradiction between the cult of death and the love of the life?" [...] Truffaut replied [...] "it's the theme of the film." [...] Gillain wrote that that the film [...] "points to cinema as a celebration of memory." [...] Yet, also thematic throughout The Green Room is a familiar [...] "estrangement from human contact and romantic obsession", which has been prominent in [...] "most of the films that Truffaut has made over a period of twenty years." ...|$|E

You utterly {{worthless}} old devil!' she cried, and the dog cringed and abased himself in servility that one could scarcely bear to look upon. I made to go.|$|R
