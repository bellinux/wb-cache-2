30|$|Results for the {{distribution}} of the categories of reaction products for the various alkanes (Table  2) indicate that, n-nonane and n-octane produced 100 % hydrocracking products at all temperatures studied while n-heptane and n-hexane produced hydroisomerisation products with a high selectivity (Table  2 and 3). A broad range of C 1 to C 6 products was found for n-nonane while n-octane produced C 1 to C 5 species. The presence of isobutanes, isopentanes and <b>isohexanes</b> among the reaction products suggests that the iso-nonanes and iso-octanes may have been produced initially but that these primary products underwent facile hydrocracking to give lighter alkanes. The test results using 2 -methyl heptane (Fig.  5) suggests that branched hydrocarbons are more reactive than n-alkanes. This is consistent with the findings that the activation energy required for n-octane was 110.38 compared to 100.11  kJ mol− 1 for 2 -methylheptane (Table  3). This indicates that isoalkanes are, at least for the longer alkanes, more active than the n-alkanes themselves and undergo rapid conversion, thereby severely limiting the selectivity to isomers that can be obtained at high conversions. Groten and Wojciechowski (1993) and De Lucas et al. (2005) have shown that n-nonane and n-octane are prone to hydrocracking (≥ 90 %) over metal supported zeolites at temperatures greater than 350  °C. At GHSV of 639 and 852  h− 1. Here, n-octane produced traces (~ 3 %) of 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane, the hydrocracking of which normally produces propane, butanes and pentanes. The higher space velocity reduced the extent of hydrocracking and shifted the reaction toward hydroisomerisation indicating again that hydrocracking resulted from conversion of primary isomerisation products. Reduced contact times and higher hydrogen partial pressure diminish the extent to which carbonaceous deposits are generated from oligomerisation and/or dehydrocyclisation reactions (Lungstein et al. 1999; Komatsu 2010). Hydroisomerisation of n-hexane and n-heptane produced 2, 2 -dimethylbutane and 2, 2 -dimethylpentane as the major respective reaction products with traces of monobranched isomers (Table  3). Selectivity to <b>isohexanes</b> was greater than selectivity to iso-heptanes at all the temperatures. n-Heptane produced methane, propane and butanes while n-hexane produced methane, propane and pentanes as the only hydrocracking species. Work by Hunter and East (2002) would suggest that the bond strengths of the central C–C for the C 6 to C 10 n-alkanes do not differ significantly and thus cannot be used to explain difference in behavior of the series. On the other hand, Brönsted acid mediated fission reactions involving the central C–C bonds become more favorable as chain length increases. This does not account, however, for the relative ease of activation of the shorter, compared with longer alkanes or the relative selectivities observed. It is clear that in order to account for both, isomerisation has to be favored, irrespective of chain length for all n-alkanes but with the shorter alkanes being more readily activated (Table  3), whereas the isomers formed are more stable for those derived from short chain alkanes and consequently undergo secondary reactions at a lesser rate. Work is ongoing to establish the contributions to the overall mechanism played by the residual sulfate on the zirconia and whether this carbided MoO 3 /SO 42 −–ZrO 2 system does operate as a truly bifunctional catalyst.|$|R

The method worked out consists of an initial separation of the binder from the PAH mixture in pure <b>isohexane.</b> Then the thin layer plate was developed back upside-down in a mixture of <b>isohexane</b> and acetone (ratio 80 / 20 by volume). The spots were then caused to fluoresce with UV light at 366 nm. In a total processing time of less than 15 minutes for both the separation of the sample and the thin-layer chromatography development process, concentrations of down to 25 mg PAH can be detected in bituminous broken-up road material. Quantification is carried out exclusively via a standard tar. Since the signals given at the lowest concentration range are difficult to detect, a process variant is recommended here, this however requiring approximately twice as much time. (orig.)

Our best atomization energies at 0 K (in kcal/mol) are: 1220. 04 n-butane, 1497. 01 n-pentane, 1774. 15 n-hexane, 2051. 17 n-heptane, 2328. 30 n-octane, 1221. 73 isobutane, 1498. 27 isopentane, 1501. 01 neopentane, 1775. 22 <b>isohexane,</b> 1774. 61 3 -methylpentane, 1775. 67 diisopropyl, 1777. 27 neohexane, 2052. 43 isoheptane, 2054. 41 neoheptane, 2330. 67 isooctane, and 2330. 81 hexamethylethane. Our best estimates for Δ H^∘_f, 298 K are: - 30. 00 n-butane, - 34. 84 n-pentane, - 39. 84 n-hexane, - 44. 74 n-heptane, - 49. 71 n-octane, - 32. 01 isobutane, - 36. 49 isopentane, - 39. 69 neopentane, - 41. 42 <b>isohexane,</b> - 40. 72 3 -methylpentane, - 42. 08 diisopropyl, - 43. 77 neohexane, - 46. 43 isoheptane, - 48. 84 neoheptane, - 53. 29 isooctane, and - 53. 68 hexamethylethane. These are in excellent agreement (typically better than 1 kJ/mol) with the experimental heats of formation at 298 K obtained from the CCCBDB and/or NIST Chemistry WebBook databases. However, at 0 K a large discrepancy between theory and experiment (1. 1 kcal/mol) is observed for only neopentane. This deviation is mainly due to the erroneous heat content function for neopentane used in calculating the 0 K CCCBDB value. The thermochemistry of these systems, especially of the larger alkanes, is an extremely difficult test for density functional methods. A posteriori corrections for dispersion are essential.

The effects of calcination temperature on the structure properties of the catalyst and its catalytic performance for aqueous phase hydrogenation of sorbitol were studied. The results showed that C(5) similar to C(6) alkanes were effectively obtained by the hydrogenation of the C-O bond in sorbitol and the following isomerization due to the synergism of the metal center and acid support. Moreover, the catalyst calcined at 500 degrees C exhibited a maximum value of 62. 0 % for sorbitol conversion and 76. 4 % of selectivity for pentane and hexane in comparison with other catalyst samples, wherein the <b>isohexane</b> selectivity was about 45. 4 %.

Smaller grains of NiO can be formed from the decomposition of nickel nitrate on the surface of HZSM- 5, which can provide with the appropriate amounts of acid and the interaction between the nickel species and acid support for easier hydrogen reduction with the Ni reducibility of 100 %. All these factors are closely related to the highest catalytic performance of Ni/HZSM- 5 catalyst for aqueous phase hydrogenation of sorbitol...|$|E

The instrumental parameters of the PFE (pressure, temperature, extraction time and number of solvent cycles) were studied {{in order to obtain}} maximum extraction yields. Neither pressure nor extraction time or temperature seemed to have any significant effect on the extraction yield, therefore one extraction cycle was enough to exhaustively extract all the PAHs from CRM 524. Once the instrumental conditions were established, the extraction yields obtained with eight different solvents or solvent mixtures [acetone, dichloromethane, acetonitrile, acetone–dichloromethane (1 + 1 v/v), acetone–isohexane (1 + 1 v/v), <b>isohexane,</b> methanol and toluene] from the CRM 524 were compared and showed that the best recoveries were obtained with acetone–isohexane (1 + 1 v/v). Finally, the effect of sand, silt, clay and the organic matter content of soil was investigated with respect to recovery of PAHs by PFE with different solvents or solvent mixtures for aged soil samples. In this case, eight soils with different sand, silt, clay and organic matter contents were slurry spiked with PAHs and aged for 19 days. Three aliquots of each slurry spiked soil were extracted with the previously mentioned solvents and the results were studied by means of principal component analysis (PCA) of the whole data set (soil composition, solubility parameter of the solvent and recoveries of all PAHs) and partial least squares (PLS).

The seven different fuels studied were n-hexane, 1 -hexene, 1 -hexyne, 2, 2 dimethyl butane, 2 methyl pentane (<b>isohexane),</b> cyclohexane and cyclohexene. The tests were performed in a constant volume, optically accessed spherical bomb, {{with the use of}} the schlieren technique and a high-speed camera. The deflagrations were initiated at elevated pressure and temperature of 0. 5 MPa and 360 K, where burning velocity data is relatively sparse, under laminar and turbulent conditions with rms turbulent velocities of 2 and 6 m/s and for equivalence ratios of 0. 78 – 1. 67. The primary objective of this work was to compare the turbulent burn rates of the different fuel–air mixtures; the laminar burning velocities were used to interpret the turbulent data. The ranking of the laminar burning velocity was overall found to be 1 -hexyne > cyclohexene > 1 -hexene > cyclohexane > n-hexane > 2 -methyl pentane > 2, 2 dimethyl butane for the range of equivalence ratios tested. The ranking was found to be the same for the turbulent burn rate measurements, particularly so for the slowest and fastest fuels. As the rms turbulent velocity increased the relative differences between the fuels were found to generally increase for lean mixtures, remain similar around stoichiometric equivalence ratio and decrease for rich mixtures. This behaviour was linked to the sensitivity of turbulent flames to stretch and thermo-diffusive stability...|$|E

The two-color laser-induced fluorescence (2 cLIF) {{is used for}} measuring the droplet temperature. The liquid fuel is seeded by pyrromethene 597 -C 8, which is a temperature-sensitive fluorescent dye. Calibration tests are performed for different types of fuels including ethanol and several alkanes {{and some of their}} mixtures. Morphology-dependent resonances (MDRs) are identified as a possible adverse effect for temperature measurements. Due to MDRs, lasing of pyrromethene 597 -C 8 may occur within fluorescent droplets and affect drastically the fluorescence signal upon which temperature measurement relies. The determination of the droplet size and velocity is achieved by means of quantitative shadow imaging. A double cavity PIV laser is focused on a piece of PMMA doped with a fluorescent dye to produce the background illumination of the droplets. A PIV camera is used to capture the drop motion between the pulses of the laser cavities. A large range of initial distance parameters (the ratio between the inter-droplet distance and the droplet diameter) is explored for different liquid fuels (ethanol, <b>isohexane,</b> n-heptane, n-decane, n-dodecane) and their mixtures. To put forward the effects of the interactions between the droplets, size and temperature measurements are compared to the isolated droplet whose evolution can be predicted with the use of classical models. Comparisons reveal that the inter-droplet spacing and also the fuel volatility {{play an important role in}} the reduction of the heat and mass transfers for these interacting droplets.

In this study, a regenerative ORC system is established {{to recover the}} waste flue gas of 160 °C. Focusing on thermodynamic and economic performance while simultaneously considering the limitations of volume flow ratio (VFR) {{and the effect of}} superheat, working fluid selection and parameter optimization have been investigated. The optimization of the evaporation temperature is carried out by analyzing the variation of net power output and specific investment cost (SIC). Then, the net power output, specific net power output, total exergy destruction rate, VFR, total capital cost, and levelized electricity cost (LEC) are selected as criteria, and a fuzzy multi-criteria evaluation method is adopted to select a more suitable working fluid and determine the optimal degree of superheat. In addition, the preheating coefficient, latent heat coefficient, superheating coefficient, and internal heat coefficient were proposed to explore the effect of working fluid critical temperature on thermal efficiency. Research studies demonstrate that there is an optimal evaporation temperature, maximizing net power output and minimizing the SIC. <b>Isohexane</b> and butane have greater specific net power output due to greater latent heat. A suitable degree of superheat is not only conducive to improving the working capacity of working fluids, but also reduces the VFR, total capital cost, SIC, and LEC for different working fluids. Thus, the system’s thermodynamic and economic performance—as well as the operational stability—are improved. Among the six working fluids, butane exhibits the best comprehensive performance, and its optimal evaporation temperature and degree of superheat are 100 °C and 5 °C, respectively...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePredictive {{models of}} heating and {{evaporation}} of fuel droplets {{in the dense}} region of sprays are essential to optimize the design of combustion chambers in internal combustion engines. This topic is addressed here, based on an experimental study using lines of equally-spaced droplets evaporating in a high temperature chamber (540 °C). The experimental setup allows controlling several key parameters including the droplet size, velocity and the inter-droplet distance. The volume-averaged temperature of the dro-plets is measured using two-color laser-induced fluorescence, while the droplet size and velocity are deduced from a double-pulse shadowgraphy method. The combination of these measurement techniques allows evaluating the heating and evaporation rates of single-component droplets made of ethanol, n-dodecane, n-decane and <b>isohexane.</b> Nusselt and Sherwood numbers are estimated from the experiments and compared with the existing correlation concerning the isolated droplet, which allows quantifying the effects of droplet interactions on the heat and mass transfers. The droplet spacing {{appears to have a}} strong influence on the size and temperature evolutions. However, it also seems necessary to consider the development of a boundary layer around the chain of droplets. As the thickness of the boundary layer increases with the distance from the injector, forced convection has a more and more limited influence on the heat and mass transport. Inside the boundary layer, the transfers are mainly governed by diffusion and convection by the Stefan flow. In a first approach, these effects are partially incorporated in a reduced parameter using the concept of volume of influence. Then, a more detailed study based on numerical simulation is carried out. The Navier–Stokes equations and the vapor transport equation are solved for various periodical arrangements of droplets. A parametric study of the influence of the main characteristic numbers involved allows to infer a correlation for Nusselt and Sherwood numbers which is finally validated against the measurements...|$|E

Organic Rankine cycle is a promising option for modular scale power plants with low temperature heat sources. The decision of selection between steam Rankine and organic Rankine cycles is influenced by solar collector field characteristics and cost, steam Rankine cycle efficiency, and power block cost. In this paper, based {{on the condition of}} equality of the levelized cost of energy, a methodology for selecting working fluid through a novel graphical representation, called working fluid selection diagram, is proposed. The proposed methodology also includes selection between parabolic trough and linear Fresnel collector based plant, for a given working fluid of the Rankine cycle. Most of the methods, proposed in literature, require multiple simulations for selecting various design parameters and optimum configuration of the plant. The proposed working fluid and solar collector field selection diagrams can be used for quick suggestion about optimal configuration of a {{concentrated solar power}} plant, without any detailed simulations.

Effects of different parameters on selection of optimal configuration of a concentrating solar power plant are also studied. The analytical procedures developed for selecting solar collector field and working fluid of the power generating cycle are important during conceptual design of a concentrated solar power plant. These methodologies can be applied at the initial design stage to compare the alternative configurations and to reduce the search space related to various design parameters. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Along with temperature and pressure measurements, the two-dimensional thickness profile of the menisci formed {{at the corners of}} the quartz cuvette was determined using the Light Microscopy Module (LMM). Even with the large, millimeter dimensions of the CVB, interfacial forces dominate in these exceedingly small Bond Number systems. The experiments were carried out at various power inputs. Although conceptually simple, the transport processes were found to be very complex with many different regions. At the heated end of the CVB, due to a high temperature gradient, we observed Marangoni flow at some power inputs. This region from the heated end to the central drop region is defined as a Marangoni dominated region. We present a simple analysis based on interfacial phenomena using only measurements from the ISS experiments that lead to a predictive equation for the thickness of the film near the heated end of the CVB. The average pressure gradient for flow in the film is assumed due to the measured capillary pressure at the two ends of the liquid film and that the pressure stress gradient due to cohesion self adjusts to a constant value over a distance L. The boundary conditions are the no slip condition at the wall interface and an interfacial shear stress at the liquid- vapor interface due to the Marangoni stress, which is due to the high temperature gradient. Although the heated end is extremely complex, since it includes three- dimensional variations in radiation, conduction, evaporation, condensation, fluid flow and interfacial forces, we find that using the above simplifying assumptions, a simple successful model can be developed...|$|E
