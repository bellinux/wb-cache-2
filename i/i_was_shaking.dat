500|$|In the 1996 musical, Evita, Madonna {{played the}} title role of Eva Perón. For a long time, Madonna had desired to play Perón and wrote to {{director}} Alan Parker to explain why she would be perfect for the part. She said later, [...] "This is the role I was born to play. I put everything of me into this because {{it was much more}} than a role in a movie. It was exhilarating and intimidating at the same time. And I am prouder of Evita than anything else I have done." [...] After securing the role, she had vocal training and learned about the history of Argentina and Perón. During shooting she became ill several times due to the intense emotional effort required. However, as she told Oprah Winfrey, she was also pregnant during the filming: [...] "I was winded after every take. I had to lie on the couch every ten minutes so I could recover from dizzy spells, I was worried that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> the baby around too much and that would injure it in some way." [...] Madonna wrote in her personal diary at the time: [...] "Ironically, this feeling of vulnerability and weakness is helping me in the movie. I'm sure Evita felt this way every day of her life once she discovered she was ill." ...|$|E
2500|$|... "The {{doctors said}} it was all due to the {{pressure}} of the show and the diet I was eating. Hours later I was getting a boardroom grilling from Sir Alan after the wedding task. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> with nerves convinced I was about to throw up all over Sir Alan and his sidekicks, Nick and Margaret." ...|$|E
60|$|Up {{on the top}} of {{the stairs}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> with excitement. I heard Lord Cheisford speak, and his voice was hoarse.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shaken! Yes, in {{one sense}} <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> <b>shaken.</b> <b>I</b> don't know quite what you mean. <b>I</b> shall never <b>be</b> <b>shaken</b> in the other way." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "--In as good stead to-morrow as to-day. But {{it may not}} <b>be</b> so. <b>I</b> own to you, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>shaken,</b> Mr. Lorry, by Doctor Manette's {{not having}} {{had the power to}} prevent this arrest." ...|$|R
60|$|I endured it stoutly, but {{inwardly}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken,</b> as <b>I</b> {{wrote to}} Philip, giving him full {{details of what}} had been said and what answers I had returned, what bitter draughts <b>I</b> had <b>been</b> forced to swallow.|$|R
6000|$|When {{we reached}} the White House and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> hands with the President, he started to say something, but I {{interrupted}} him and said: ...|$|E
60|$|MRS. JONES. But {{of course}} when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> out my husband's coat the cigarette-box fell out {{and all the}} {{cigarettes}} were scattered on the bed.|$|E
6000|$|... "Never," [...] I answered, {{notwithstanding}} my pity of {{the brave}} girl, and then while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> lest he should go in to visit Nanny, I heard the echo of the Auld Licht bell.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{shall have}} a {{fortnight}} {{to pick up}} on board the steamer,' Captain Hampton said. 'I have just had a bout of illness, but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>shaking</b> it off, and it will be at least three weeks before <b>I</b> <b>am</b> at Omaha.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, mind how you put it, Bucket," [...] {{cried the}} old man anxiously with his hand at his ear. [...] "Speak up; none of your {{brimstone}} tricks. Pick me up; I want to hear better. Oh, Lord, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>shaken</b> to bits!" ...|$|R
60|$|There is a {{grain of}} superstition in the most level-headed man. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not {{particularly}} level-headed, and I {{have more than a}} grain in me. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken.</b> Ever since <b>I</b> had asked Cynthia to marry me, {{it seemed as if the}} ghost of Audrey had come back into my life.|$|R
6000|$|... "'It is a surrender,' I said. And I {{remember}} <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> {{her wrists}} I held apart in my hands. 'But it's more than talk. Your {{father told me}} to go on in God's name.' ...|$|E
60|$|I crept {{close to}} {{him and told him}} in a breathless undertone, and I knew that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> the while. He listened gravely, and when I had {{finished}} laid a firm hand on my head.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not if {{you leave}} me! You must come with me," [...] I said, still {{dreading}} that he would leave me in church, send a fly, and fall a victim at the [...] "Boar;" [...] and, indeed, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> so, {{that he would not}} withdraw his arm, and said, soothingly, [...] "I'm coming." ...|$|E
60|$|In listening, I sobbed convulsively; for I could repress what I endured no longer; <b>I</b> <b>was</b> {{obliged to}} yield, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> {{from head to}} foot with acute distress. When I did speak, it was only to express an impetuous wish that <b>I</b> had never <b>been</b> born, or never come to Thornfield.|$|R
6000|$|... "Your mother {{saw that}} I meant what I said; it isn't {{everybody}} that does me the honour to perceive that. She saw that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> {{from head to}} foot. I could only say three words--I couldn't have spoken more! What a power--what a power, Miss Tarrant!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Now, Alda,' said Wilmet earnestly, 'you {{must not}} talk without knowing. Till I went there, I never {{understood}} how much goodness and principle {{there could be}} without my stiffness and particularity. I know <b>I</b> have often <b>been</b> very unnecessarily disagreeable and disapproving, and <b>I</b> hope <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>shaken</b> out of it in time.' ...|$|R
60|$|Her {{voice was}} cold and measured; her manner strangely formal and hard. It {{seemed to me that}} she was {{absolutely}} resolved not to be drawn into any argument or explanation. As for me, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> with agitation, and I turned my face aside, so ashamed was I that she should see my want of control.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I did," [...] he answered. [...] "I put a penny in {{the slot}} here," [...] he continued, feeling {{apparently}} the need of unburdening himself: [...] "wanted a box of matches. I couldn't get anything put, and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> the machine, and swearing at it, as one does, when there came along a man, about your size, and--you're SURE it wasn't you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'To this I {{replied that}} I was {{very fond of}} {{statuary}} and architecture, or something silly of that sort, at which she frowned, {{and there was a}} pause. By this time my nerves were on such a stretch that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> like a leaf. I knew that something awful was going to happen, but she held me under a kind of spell, and I could not help myself.|$|E
6000|$|Inwardly, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken.</b> Not--in {{orthodox}} {{language from}} any [...] "conviction of sin." [...] Yet {{it was my}} first intimation that my part in the legislation referred to was known to any save a select few. I blamed Krebs, and a hot anger arose within me against him. After all, what could they prove? ...|$|R
6000|$|... "My experience," [...] he said, [...] "has {{included}} many melancholy duties, and has tried my composure in terrible scenes; but I have never yet {{found myself in}} the presence of an unrepentant criminal, sentenced to death--and that criminal a woman and a mother. I own, sir, that <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>shaken</b> by the prospect before me." ...|$|R
60|$|There came {{a climax}} {{when she tried}} to jump out of a window, and he had to save her by some perfunctary, unmeant wooing. Even <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaken</b> by the depths of the {{absorbing}} affection she showed. Home, friends, traditions, creeds went up like thistle-down in the scale against her love. It was really discomposing.|$|R
60|$|Next moment <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> {{hands with}} Frank and Jim, Jones's ranchmen. At a glance I liked them both. Frank {{was short and}} wiry, and had a big, ferocious mustache, the effect of which was {{softened}} by his kindly brown eyes. Jim was tall, a little heavier; he had a careless, tidy look; his eyes were searching, and though he appeared a young man, his hair was white.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You can't {{imagine what}} a funny feeling hanging gives you,' murmured the Shifty Lad, who looked rather purple {{in the face}} and spoke in an odd voice. 'I don't think you have every tried it, or you wouldn't have let me go up first. Why, it is the pleasantest thing I have ever done. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> my legs from sheer delight, and if you had been there you would have shaken your legs too.' ...|$|E
60|$|It was {{not quite}} half-past one when the {{messenger}} departed. Before half-past three he returned, and brought the doctor with him. Mr. Dawson's kindness, and the delicacy with which he treated his prompt assistance quite {{as a matter of}} course, almost overpowered me. The bail required was offered, and accepted immediately. Before four o'clock, on that afternoon, <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> hands warmly with the good old doctor--a free man again--in the streets of Knowlesbury.|$|E
60|$|There {{went through}} me so great a heave of {{surprise}} that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> all <b>shook</b> with it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{exploring}} the cliff above when I happened to slip {{and fall into}} the bushes {{just in front of}} the door. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shook</b> up but not hurt, and when I got up I saw the door and wondered what it meant. Then I looked inside and after that went back to camp to tell you fellows about it." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{following}} morning, after a prayer, Gandhi {{raised a}} lump of salty mud and declared, [...] "With this, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>shaking</b> {{the foundations of the}} British Empire." [...] He then boiled it in seawater, producing illegal salt. He implored his thousands of followers to likewise begin making salt along the seashore, [...] "wherever it is convenient" [...] and to instruct villagers in making illegal, but necessary, salt.|$|R
60|$|The {{thing that}} struck me first {{was that he was}} an elderly man; yet, after a minute's thought, I {{perceived}} that it was otherwise, and in five minutes, the eyes looking at me, I saw that the grey hair was an accident of the most trivial. He was quite young. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> his hand. I was smoking his cigar, and I was hearing him talk--this man I had learned to love and admire fourteen thousand miles away.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{started on}} an Injin trot after you, {{just as you}} turned off the trail, but you'd got so far ahead while <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> myself clear of Uncle Ben that I had to jist lope the whole way through the woods to catch up." [...] She stopped, and looking up into his troubled face caught his cheeks between her hands, and {{bringing}} his knit brows down {{to the level of}} her humid blue eyes said, [...] "You haven't kissed me yet. What's the matter?" ...|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>shaking</b> {{hands with}} his companion, a nobleman with whom I {{had had the}} honour to serve in America. [...] "I came," [...] I said, [...] "to {{convince}} myself of a fact, about which you were mistaken yesterday; and I find the proof in your lordship's own house. Your lordship was pleased to take your lordship's Bible oath, {{that there was no}} agreement between your father and his mother, relative to some property which I hold. When Mr. Sampson was your lordship's secretary, he perfectly remembered having seen a copy of such an assignment, and here it is." ...|$|E
60|$|It is {{certainly}} {{to be reckoned}} not so very far below London, which, with Mr. Henry James, Mr. Harry Harland, and Mr. Bret Harte, seems to me an American literary centre worthy to be named with contemporary Boston. Which is our chief literary centre, however, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> not, after all, ready to say. When I remember Mr. G. W. Cable, at Northampton, Massachusetts, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>shaken</b> in all my preoccupations; when I think of Mark Twain, {{it seems to me}} that our greatest literary centre is just now at Riverdale- on-the-Hudson.|$|R
60|$|I shall {{keep this}} note until to-morrow to correct my {{conviction}} if I {{can see the}} least reason for correcting it; but I feel very confident indeed that <b>I</b> cannot <b>be</b> <b>shaken</b> in it.|$|R
6000|$|... "And so, if <b>I</b> <b>were</b> to <b>shake</b> my head at {{you when}} you were doing any thing wrong, and you wore to {{continue}} doing it, that would be disobedience." ...|$|R
