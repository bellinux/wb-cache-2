500|$|I pop {{the video}} in, and wow... Tears welling, silence, goose-bumps... Wow. [...] I just lost my girlfriend, because that song isn't mine anymore... It really {{made me think}} about how {{powerful}} music is as a medium and art form. I wrote some words and music <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> {{as a way of}} staying sane, about a bleak and desperate place I was in, totally isolated and alone. [...] that winds up reinterpreted by a music legend from a radically different era/genre and still retains sincerity and meaning— different, but every bit as pure.|$|E
500|$|Chesnutt shopped {{the album}} around to record companies, but they mistook {{it for a}} demo and {{rejected}} it. They encouraged him to reproduce it smoothly, rearrange the drums, and rerecord his vocals. He {{said in an interview}} for Vibe at the time, [...] "I refuse to re-record it-that defeats the purpose. What about the experience I had <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bedroom?</b> To go back to the studio, I'd be chasing something. If you're listening to it and you love it, then it's already done what it's supposed to do." [...] In September 2002, Chesnutt made the album available through his website, and released it on September 24 on his own label Ready, Set, Go! ...|$|E
500|$|Jolie had {{a serious}} boyfriend for two years {{from the age of}} 14. Her mother allowed them to live {{together}} in her home, of which Jolie later said, [...] "I was either going to be reckless on the streets with my boyfriend or {{he was going to be}} with me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> with my mom in the next room. She made the choice, and because of it, I continued to go to school every morning and explored my first relationship in a safe way." [...] She has compared the relationship to a marriage in its emotional intensity, and said that the breakup compelled her to dedicate herself to her acting career at the age of 16.|$|E

500|$|The group's primary musical {{influences}} {{came from}} bands such as Buzzcocks, The Jam, Madness and The Kinks. Supergrass took this contemporary music and mixed it with pop punk's characteristic fast, three-chord, guitar-based, catchy tunes {{to produce a}} sound uniquely their own; [...] "we were just {{the three of us}} <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> or someone's house, just making... we played really hard and just made loads of noise. Most of our early songs were just three chord grooves and stuff that was fun to play. So that's why the first album sounded so 'punky', I think... it's just 'cause we were all used to playing in this small room and it being really loud, so we just made the album sound like that." [...] Songs for Beginners by Graham Nash was another possible influence on I Should Coco. Gaz Coombes told The Guardian in 2003, [...] "We used to listen to it a lot when we lived in Cowley Road in Oxford in 1994, just when the band were getting big." ...|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, Eminent Hipsters, Fagen {{notes that}} the cover figure [...] "wasn't {{supposed}} to be a stand-in for any particular jazz DJ," [...] but noted a few personalities from the period that factored into the creation: Ed Beach, Dan Morgenstern, Martin Williams, R.D. Harlan, [...] "Symphony Sid" [...] Torin, and what Fagen regarded as his [...] "main man", WEVD's Mort Fega. [...] "He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you'd had." [...] At the time of the album's release, he remembered that jazz music offered him an escape from the adults in his life: [...] "When I saw E.T.,' I realized that the E.T. <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> was my Thelonious Monk records. Everything that he represented was totally unworldly in a way, although at the same time jazz to me seemed more real than the environment in which I was living." [...] The Wall Street Journal Robert J. Toth writes, [...] "The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we see Mr. Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window in a row of tract homes — or maybe the artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration." [...] Robert Palmer, of The New York Times, continued in this line of thinking: [...] "Inside, there's a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He's playing it softly, so his parents won't wake up, and he can barely make out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bergman cited {{his desire}} to one day perform in Graceland as another {{influence}} on the project, musing that if the band became popular enough he {{would one day be}} able to perform there. Bergman commented [...] "I used to sit <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> and think, 'Damn, if we could just play Graceland, I would die a happy guy'". Before the album was released, it was promoted by the release of a music video for the single [...] "They Live".|$|E

2500|$|English {{versions}} of Jacques Brel songs {{have been recorded}} by {{a wide variety of}} artists. Rod McKuen {{was one of the first}} American artists to discover and translate Brel's songs. Canadian Terry Jacks' version of [...] "Seasons in the Sun" [...] (based on Brel's [...] "Le Moribond") became a global pop hit in 1974, topping the charts internationally. [...] "Seasons in the Sun" [...] has seen its own renditions recorded by artists ranging from the Beach Boys to Nirvana. McKuen and Brel formed a close friendship. McKuen later wrote, [...] "When news of Jacques' death came, I stayed locked <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> and drank for a week." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2005, on 60 Minutes, he told Mike Wallace {{that his}} life could have turned out differently. [...] "I'd got {{accepted}} to a seminary in Wisconsin, and I was gonna become a priest, {{but at the last}} second I thought, 'I'll just go to public school.' I had just gotten a new amplifier <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bedroom,</b> and I didn't think I was allowed to take it with me." [...] Instead, he got accepted into the famed Cass Technical High School as a business major, and played the drums and trombone in the band. At 15, he began a three-year upholstery apprenticeship with a family friend, Brian Muldoon. He credits Muldoon with exposing him to punk music as they worked together in the shop. Muldoon goaded his young apprentice into forming a band: [...] "He played drums", Gillis thought. [...] "Well I guess I'll play guitar then." [...] The two recorded an album, Makers of High Grade Suites, as the Upholsterers.|$|E
2500|$|Ballinger {{was briefly}} {{unsure of what}} to do with her newfound {{internet}} success, but in April 2009, Jim Caruso invited her to perform as the character at Cast Party, a weekly show at his Birdland jazz club in New York City. She recalls, [...] "I went from making a minute-and-a-half video <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> to doing an hour-and-a-half live show". Members of the Broadway theatre community quickly embraced the Miranda videos and were eager to be a part of Miranda's live comedy acts. Frankie Grande, who was then in the cast of Mamma Mia!, invited Ballinger to join the cast as Miranda at the Minskoff Theatre in the 2009 Broadway Cares Easter Bonnet competition charity benefit. Later, Broadway celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda performed in videos with Miranda. Ballinger was also invited to perform in London. At the Leicester Square Theatre in 2010, Miranda taught [...] "voice lessons" [...] to, and performed with, such West End theatre stars as Leanne Jones, Scarlett Strallen, Daniel Boys, Julie Atherton, Ian ‘H’ Watkins, Anna-Jane Casey, Jon Lee and Noel Sullivan, and the London casts of Naked Boys Singing, Wicked and Les Misérables. Since the summer of 2009, Miranda Sings has also been featured in radio, television and internet interviews where the interviewers explore the personality traits of, and play along with, the character.|$|E

50|$|Babe Rainbow is {{the only}} House of Love studio album to feature Simon Walker (ex-Dave Howard Singers {{as well as being}} Chris Groothuizen and Pete Evans’ bandmate <b>in</b> <b>My</b> White <b>Bedroom).</b> Walker had {{replaced}} Terry Bickers as lead guitarist in December 1989 and would himself leave the band in mid-1992 (to be replaced by Simon Mawby of The Woodentops).

60|$|It was Christmas Eve, and I had to {{stir the}} pudding for next day, with a copper-stick, from seven to eight by the Dutch clock.

6000|$|I {{was awakened}} next {{day by the}} sun {{streaming}} <b>in</b> at <b>my</b> <b>bedroom</b> window. It was a glorious morning. I sprang {{out of bed and}} looked at my watch.

60|$|This {{was not an}} easy {{matter to}} compass in a poor house like ours, where we had nothing {{valuable}} to put under lock and key. After running over various hiding-places <b>in</b> <b>my</b> mind, I thought of my tea-caddy, a present from Mrs. Knifton, which I always kept out of harm's way <b>in</b> <b>my</b> own <b>bedroom.</b> Most unluckily--as it afterward turned out--instead of taking the pocketbook to the tea-caddy, I went into my room first to take the tea-caddy to the pocketbook. I only acted in this roundabout way from sheer thoughtlessness, and severely enough I was punished for it, as you will acknowledge yourself when you have read a page or two more of my story.|$|R

5000|$|In {{a seminar}} on revisiting {{psychiatric}} disorders which centred around Chandramukhi and Anniyan, psychiatrist Asokan noted {{that there were many}} logical faults in both films.

Anyone watching films could come to a conclusion that ghosts have uniform--white saree and a pale face. My family saw the Malayalam film Manichitrathazu.

60|$|As I stood <b>in</b> <b>my</b> lonely <b>bedroom</b> at the hotel, {{trying to}} tie my white tie myself, {{it struck me}} for the first time that there must be whole squads of chappies in the world who had to get along without a man to look after them. I'd always thought of Jeeves as a kind of natural phenomenon; but, by Jove! of course, when you come to think of it, there must be quite a lot of fellows who have to press their own clothes {{themselves}} and haven't got anybody to bring them tea in the morning, and so on. It was rather a solemn thought, don't you know. I mean to say, ever since then I've been able to appreciate the frightful privations the poor have to stick.|$|R
40|$|International audienceTwo {{years ago}} I lived for 11 {{months in the}} 17 th floor of a {{high-rise}} building <b>in</b> Shanghai. <b>My</b> <b>bedroom</b> had a small bow window, a privileged observatory; wherefrom everyday I looked at the city. From there, there wasn't architecture anymore, there wasn't social life; {{there was just a}} big pattern. On the contrary when I was walking on the street, Shanghai appeared to me a crowded city full of signs, people, messages and objects: a tremendous chaos. Looking from my window every thing was appearing differently: it was calm and diffuse. My glance was wondering in front of that view that every morning was changing. Every morning the city was more or less suspended, it was wrapped in a thinner or thicker layer of haze. This opacity made the city lighter, impalpable, almost fragile <b>in</b> front of <b>my</b> eyes. This aesthetic quality won me; I was every day inside a fairy-tale. I connected my visual experience with the "Air" of Shanghai. Here it started "Shanghai, Air and other stories"...|$|R
