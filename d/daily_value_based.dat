Although several academic efforts to make publically available wind energy resource data in Venezuela, {{there is a lack of}} information in terms of local wind resource putting in risk development in areas where potential is good enough for commercial exploitation. The objective of this paper is to presents a very comprehensive wind resource assessment at Los Taques, Venezuela based on on-site observation anemometry. This is unique paper because it is the first ever wind energy assessment in Los Taques using hourly data recorded during three years in an on-site ground weather station contrary to studies <b>based</b> on <b>daily</b> <b>values</b> <b>based</b> on radar or satellite data.

The USA joins these three in not publishing a Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA), due to lack of consensus evidence. They have, however, published Adequate Intake (AI) values. The US Institute of Medicine (IOM) notes that these figures are based on just one study and that there was little data and the choline made by the body (assuming a dietary intake of zero) may be enough for some groups.

Additionally advancements in electronics and shortage of water have {{led to the development of}} “smart” or adaptive irrigation controllers that adjust the water application depth to plant needs, and thus increase water savings. The two most common types are soil moisture based and evapotranspiration based systems. In the first type, one or more sensors monitor the evolution of the soil water content, and trigger irrigation when a pre-defined soil moisture deficit is achieved, or a certain water tension is reached in the soil. The climate based systems usually measure one or more weather parameters and based on these establish the The objective of this work is to compare the performance of these two smart irrigation technologies for producing lettuce in greenhouses in southern Iberia. In the soil moisture methodology, Echo 5 sensors made by Decagon devices were used to monitor soil moisture content. The irrigation was set to start at three different soil moisture content, corresponding to a depletion of 10, 20 and 30 % of soil moisture content at 10 cm depth. For the evapotranspiration based method, the Hargreaves Samani reduced-set evapotranspiration estimates were used to control irrigation. A purpose built microcontroller was developed that calculates <b>daily</b> ETo <b>values</b> <b>based</b> on maximum and minimum temperature, and then makes daily water applications to compensate the exact amount of water lost to the Atmosphere. For this research specific The results indicate that the Eto based methodology is easier to use, and can provide excellent water use efficiency as long as it is previously calibrated.

40|$|The pseudo-total {{and oral}} bioaccessible {{concentration}} of six potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in urban street dust was investigated. Typical pseudo-total concentrations across the sampling sites ranged from 4. 4 to 8. 6 mg kg− 1 for As, 0. 2 – 3. 6 mg kg− 1 for Cd, 25 – 217 mg kg− 1 for Cu, 14 – 46 mg kg− 1 for Ni, 70 – 4261 mg kg− 1 for Pb, and, 111 – 652 mg kg− 1 for Zn. This data compared favourably with other urban street dust samples collected and analysed {{in a variety}} of cities globally; the exception was the high level of Pb determined in a specific sample in this study. The oral bioaccessibility of PTEs in street dust is also assessed using in vitro gastrointestinal extraction (Unified Bioaccessibility Method, UBM). Based on a worst case scenario the oral bioaccessibility data estimated that Cd and Zn had the highest % bioaccessible fractions (median > 45 %) while the other PTEs i. e. As, Cu, Ni and Pb had lower % bioaccessible fractions (median < 35 %). The pseudo-total and bioaccessible concentrations of PTEs in the samples has been compared to estimated tolerable <b>daily</b> intake <b>values</b> <b>based</b> on unintentional soil/dust consumption.

With respect to As and Pb, only the latter exceeds the TDIoral if we model ingestion rate based on atmospheric ‘dustiness’ rather than the US EPA (2008) unintentional soil/dust consumption rate of 100 mg d− 1.
