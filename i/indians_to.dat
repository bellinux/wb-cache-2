5|$|The Indian agent Lorimier {{traveled}} west to Oswegatchie, where {{a company}} of the 8th Regiment of Foot {{under the command of}} George Forster had occupied Fort de La Présentation.

5|$|The {{fact that}} Indians allied to the British {{witnessed}} the debacle first hand complicated future relations with them.

5|$|According to Guha, Nehru and his Congress colleagues {{called on}} <b>Indians</b> <b>to</b> honour Gandhi's memory {{and even more}} his ideals. Nehru used the {{assassination}} to consolidate {{the authority of the}} new Indian state. Gandhi's death helped marshal support for the new government and legitimise the Congress Party's control, leveraged by the massive outpouring of Hindu expressions of grief for a man who had inspired them for decades. The government suppressed the RSS, the Muslim National Guards, and the Khaksars, with some 200,000 arrests.|$|E
5|$|Although the Belloni {{decision}} {{established the}} rights of the <b>Indians</b> <b>to</b> exercise their treaty fishing rights, the states of Oregon and Washington continued to arrest Indians for violations of state law and regulations that infringed on those rights. In September 1970, the United States Attorney filed an action in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington alleging that the state of Washington had infringed on the treaty rights of the Hoh, Makah, Muckleshoot, Nisqually, Puyallup, Quileute, and Skokomish tribes. Later, the Lummi, Quinault, Sauk-Suiattle, Squaxin Island, Stillaguamish, Upper Skagit, and Yakima tribes intervened in the case. Defendants were the state of Washington, the Washington Department of Fisheries, the Washington Game Commission, and the Washington Reef Net Owners Association.|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we present our {{work on a}} case study between Statistical Machien Transaltion (SMT) and Rule-Based Machine Translation (RBMT) systems on English-Indian langugae and <b>Indian</b> <b>to</b> <b>Indian</b> langugae perspective. Main {{objective}} of our study {{is to make a}} five way performance compariosn; such as, a) SMT and RBMT b) SMT on English-Indian langugae c) RBMT on English-Indian langugae d) SMT on <b>Indian</b> <b>to</b> <b>Indian</b> langugae perspective e) RBMT on <b>Indian</b> <b>to</b> <b>Indian</b> langugae perspective. Through a detailed analysis we describe the Rule Based and the Statistical Machine Translation system developments and its evaluations. Through a detailed error analysis, we point out the relative strengths and weaknesses of both systems. The observations based on our study are: a) SMT systems outperforms RBMT b) In the case of SMT, English <b>to</b> <b>Indian</b> language MT systmes performs better than <b>Indian</b> <b>to</b> English langugae MT systems c) In the case of RBMT, English <b>to</b> <b>Indian</b> langugae MT systems perofrms better than <b>Indian</b> <b>to</b> Englsih Language MT systems d) SMT systems performs better for <b>Indian</b> <b>to</b> <b>Indian</b> language MT systems compared to RBMT. Effectively, we shall see that even {{with a small amount of}} training corpus a statistical machine translation system has many advantages for high quality domain specific machine translation over that of a rule-based counterpart.

5|$|Another {{focus of}} the Canadian {{government}} {{was to make the}} Aboriginal groups of Canada sedentary, as they thought that this would make them easier to assimilate. In the 19th century, the government began to support the creation of model farming villages, which were meant to encourage non-sedentary Aboriginal groups to settle in an area and begin to cultivate agriculture. When most of these model farming villages failed, the government turned instead to the creation of Indian reserves with the Indian Act of 1876. With the creation of these reserves came many restricting laws, such as further bans on all intoxicants, restrictions on eligibility to vote in band elections, decreased hunting and fishing areas, and inability for status <b>Indians</b> <b>to</b> visit other groups on their reservations.|$|E
5|$|At the Detroit council, DePeyster {{encouraged}} the <b>Indians</b> <b>to</b> unite and {{to send a}} force to oppose Clark's expedition. In May 1781, Indian leaders and Indian Department officials began to gather warriors at the Wyandot town of Upper Sandusky for this purpose. In mid-August, Brant and George Girty, Simon's brother, headed south to the Ohio River with about 90 Iroquois, Shawnee, and Wyandot warriors, {{as well as a}} few white men, while McKee and Simon Girty continued to collect reinforcements.|$|E

He pitched the first game against Rube Marquard, and allowed one run and five hits in a 3–1 Cleveland victory. Four days later, he pitched game four, again allowing one run and five hits in a 5–1 win. In game seven, the final one of the series, Coveleski threw a complete game shutout with five hits against fellow spitballer Burleigh Grimes; the 3–0 victory gave the Indians the first World Series championship in franchise history. Coveleski had an ERA of 0.67, which remains a World Series record.|$|E

That year, he also helped prepare the Chicago Bears for the 1940 NFL Championship Game, in which they routed Washington, 73–0.

Shaughnessy also coached college basketball at Tulane University. He played college football at the University of Minnesota.|$|E
5|$|In 1641, Harvard University sent three preachers to England {{to raise}} money for missionary {{activities}} among the <b>Indians.</b> <b>To</b> support the fund-raising, the University produced one of the earliest fund-raising brochures, New England's First Fruits. An early version of the press release was used when King's College (now Columbia University), sent out an announcement of its 1758 graduation ceremonies and several newspapers printed the information. Princeton was the first university to make it a routine practice of supplying newspapers with information about activities at the college.|$|E
5|$|In 1790, Whinecheoh {{died at the}} age of eighty, and Succohanes died in 1792 at the age of ninety. After their deaths, Alder wandered from {{village to}} village, and began courting an Indian woman from Upper Sandusky named Barshaw. In the fall of 1793, during the peak of the Northwest Indian War, he joined Shawnee chief Blue Jacket to defend against Anthony Wayne's attacks in the Ohio Country, and also took part in the attack on Fort Recovery on June 30, 1794. Alder was asked for advice on the 1795 Treaty of Greenville on land reservations, and urged by the <b>Indians</b> <b>to</b> attend its signing.

5|$|In 1906, the Transvaal {{government}} promulgated a new Act compelling {{registration of}} the colony's Indian and Chinese populations. At a mass protest meeting held in Johannesburg on 11 September that year, Gandhi adopted his still evolving methodology of Satyagraha (devotion to the truth), or nonviolent protest, {{for the first}} time. The idea of nonviolence was ultimately bolstered when Gandhi {{was inspired by a}} letter written to Tarak Nath Das by the Russian pacifist Leo Tolstoy on 14 December 1908, which introduced Gandhi to the ancient Indian moral literature of the Tirukkural. He urged <b>Indians</b> <b>to</b> defy the new law and to suffer the punishments for doing so. Gandhi's ideas of protests, persuasion skills and public relations had emerged. He took these back to India in 1915.|$|E
5|$|McGinnity {{played for}} and managed the Indians through 1912. The Indians {{finished}} second in the EL in 1909 and 1910. McGinnity sold his interests in the <b>Indians</b> <b>to</b> Ebbets and Ed McKeever and purchased the Tacoma Tigers of the Class-B Northwestern League for $8,500 ($ in current dollar terms), spending another $50,000 ($ in current dollar terms) on the franchise in renovating the stadium. He served as player-manager the Tigers {{at the start of the}} 1913 season, but stepped down as manager, hiring Russ Hall to serve as manager in June. McGinnity sold stock in the team in 1915 in order to afford operating expenses. He also briefly played for the Venice Tigers of the Class-A Pacific Coast League in 1914.|$|E

5|$|The {{massacre}} and Gandhi's non-violent {{response to}} it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was getting away with murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked <b>Indians</b> <b>to</b> boycott. The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi {{to the belief that}} Indians will never get a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to Swaraj or self rule and political independence for India. In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress. He reorganised the Congress. With Congress now behind him, and Muslim support triggered by his backing the Khilafat movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, Gandhi had the political support and the attention of the British Raj.|$|E
