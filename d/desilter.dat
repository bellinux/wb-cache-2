50|$|Desanders and desilters {{are solid}} control {{equipment}} {{with a set}} of hydrocyclones that separate sand and silt from the drilling fluids in drilling rigs. Desanders are installed on top of the mud tank following the shale shaker and the degasser, but before the <b>desilter.</b> Desander removes the abrasive solids from the drilling fluids which cannot be removed by shakers. Normally the solids diameter for desander to be separated would be 45~74μm, and 15~44μm for <b>desilter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Solids {{control is}} a {{technique}} used in a drilling rig to separate the solids in the drilling fluids that are crushed by the drill bits and carried out of the well surface. Normally, a solid control system contains five stages: the mud tank, shale shaker, vacuum degasser, desander, <b>desilter,</b> and centrifuge. The shale shaker is used to separate big solids with diameter above 75μm, the desander addresses solids from 45-74μm, and the <b>desilter</b> segregates solids between 15-44μm. Sometimes the desander and <b>desilter</b> are combined as one high efficiency mud cleaner. When air enters the drilling fluids, a vacuum degasser is used to separate the air. When there is no air in the mud, the degasser works as a big agitator. All these stages are mounted {{on the top of}} the mud tank. After separating the solids, the clean mud can be pumped into the borehole again.|$|E
50|$|Nowadays, mud cleaner used in {{oilfield}} {{means the}} equipment processing drilling mud. It {{is combined with}} desander cone and <b>desilter</b> cone as well as bottom shaker. It is called 2nd and 3rd phase solids control equipment.|$|E
50|$|A mud cleaner is a {{combination}} of desanders and/or <b>desilters</b> to remove drilled solids from mud.|$|R
30|$|Particle size {{distribution}} is extensively used by geologists in geomorphological studies to evaluate sedimentation and alluvial processes and by civil engineers to evaluate materials used for foundations, road fill, and other construction purposes. In {{the oil and}} gas industry, analysis of particle {{size distribution}} is used to determine filtration loss properties, and the amount of solids retained in the DF after the fluid is pumped into the system. A DF containing particles of sizes ranging up to the requisite maximum should be able to effectively bridge the formation and form a filter cake (in the case of a water-based drilling fluid). Above 10 Darcys or in fractures, larger particles are required, and most likely the amounts needed to minimize spurt losses increase with the size of the openings. In general, with the increasing concentration of bridging particles, bridging occurs faster, and spurt loss declines (Barrett et al. 2005; Growcock and Harvey 2005). Filtrate invasion into the formation can substantially reduce the permeability of the near wellbore region either by particle plugging, clay swelling, or water blocking. Permeability of the filter cake is dependent on the particle size distribution as an increase in the particle size decreases the permeability {{due to the fact that}} colloidal particles get packed very tightly. For non-reservoir applications, enough particles of the required size range are usually present in most DFs after cutting just a few feet of rock. These particles impact the choice of various drilling equipment (i.e., shale shakers, desanders, <b>desilters,</b> etc.) at the surface and thus can be effectively designed by having a prior knowledge of the particle sizing in the drilling fluid (Wajheeuddin and Hossain 2014).|$|R
50|$|The {{weighted}} mud {{flows to}} the inlet head {{section of the}} desander and/or <b>desilter</b> entering the hydrocyclones for separation of particles. Mud leaving the underflow is further screened with fine mesh to separate larger particles allowing only barite size particles {{to pass through the}} screen returning and recovering then the clean mud.|$|E
50|$|The {{number of}} the mud tanks that are needed on the {{drilling}} rig depends on {{the depth of the}} well, and also the mud demands of drilling. Normally the shale shaker and vacuum degasser and desander are mounted together on the same mud tank as the first tank at the oilfield, while <b>desilter</b> and centrifuge on the second tank. Also, the drilling rig has other different tanks such as a reserve tank, emergency tank, etc.|$|E
50|$|A mud cleaner is a {{combination}} of desanders and/or desilters mounted over a shaker with a fine mesh screen. A mud is fed to the inlet of the hydrocyclone (desander and/or <b>desilter)</b> to separate particles and the underflow passes to the fine screen mesh where in particles larger than barite are discarded and thrown away. In most drilling operations, a mud cleaner is installed in its mud systems. It is usually located in a mud tank in the same location as with the desilters.|$|E
50|$|Drilling fluids {{flow into}} the shale shaker {{directly}} after it returns {{to the surface of}} the well, and the solids that are removed by the screen would be discharged out of the tank, and the drilling fluids with smaller solids would flow through the screen into mud tank for further purification. A centrifugal pump sucks the shaker-treated fluids up to the <b>desilter</b> or mud cleaner for further purification. And vertical slurry pump is used to pump the drilling fluids up to the centrifuge, and a mud pump would pump the drilling fluids from mud tank into the borehole after it is treated by centrifuge and the circulation system continues.|$|E
5000|$|Desanders have no moving parts. The {{larger the}} {{internal}} {{diameter of the}} desander is, the greater the amount of drilling fluids {{it is able to}} process and the larger the size of the solids removed. A desander with a (10 in cone) is able to remove 50% of solids within the 40-50 μm (micrometre) range at a flow rate of , whilea <b>desilter</b> (4 in Cone) is able to remove 50% of solids within the 15-20 μm range at a flow rate of [...] Micro-fine separators are able to remove 50% of solids within the 10-15 μm range at a flow rate of [...] A desander is typically positioned next-to-last in the arrangement of solids control equipment, with a desander centrifuge as the subsequent processing unit. Desanders are preceded by gas busters, gumbo removal equipment (if utilized), shale shaker, mud cleaner (if utilized) and a vacuum degasser. Desanders are widely used in oilfield drilling.Practice has proved that hydrocyclone desanders are economic and effective equipment.|$|E
5000|$|In {{conventional}} drilling fluids, barite is used {{to increase}} the density. Although other additives such as halite (salt) or calcium carbonate can also be used. Mud weight can be decreased by dilution or solids control equipment such as an industrial centrifuge, <b>desilter,</b> desander and shale shaker [...] Mud weight use to control the trapped fluids or gas in the formations by adding a hydro static pressure on them [...] increasing the mud weight = increasing the hydro static pressure. If the hydro static pressure increased over the formations pressure {{that will make a}} fracture in the formation leading to loss the mud to the formation, so adding loss circulation material like gel-flake or wood chips that can refill the gap and stop the mud loss. If the mud loss continues, then the hydro static pressure will decrease and flammable fluids and gas trapped under pressure will start leaking to the surface. This can lead to a potential blowout.|$|E
