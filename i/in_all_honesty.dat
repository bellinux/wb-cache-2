The bad side of that {{is that a lot of}} people will just say 'dubstep equals Skrillex'. But <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>honesty</b> it genuinely doesn't bother me. I like the music he makes." [...] Other North American artists that were initially associated with the brostep sound were Canadian producers Datsik and Excision. Their production style has been described by Mixmag as [...] "a viciously harsh, yet brilliantly produced sound that appealed more to Marilyn Manson and Nine Inch Nails fans than it did to lovers of UK garage". The brostep sound also attracted the attention of metal bands. [...] Nu metal band Korn's 2011 album The Path of Totality features several collaborations with electronic music producers, including Skrillex and Excision. [...] The term metalstep has been used for a fusion of brostep and metal.|$|E
500|$|The song is {{composed}} {{in the key}} of F minor, with Carey's vocal range spanning from the low-note of B3 to the high-note of A5. Aside from Dupri's verses, Carey's longtime background singer Trey Lorenz makes a notable impression on the song, and earned credits for providing background vocals. Lyrically, the song is written in a female perspective, where they ask the man for their number at a club. In an interview with MTV News, Carey jokingly addressed the lyrics, claiming Dupri [...] "really {{wanted it to be}} coming from the girl, like 'can I get your number' to the guy. But <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>honesty</b> that would never be me!" [...] Aside from her signature vocals, Carey adopts a breathy rap for parts of the song, which read [...] "I got a pimp penthouse / With a sick hot tub / We can watch a flat screen / While the bubbles filling up." [...] According to Jozen Cummings from PopMatters, the lyrics and Carey's vocal switch make the song [...] "fun and comedic".|$|E

He maintained the standard the following season; Dover's best player against rivals Rushden & Diamonds, he was eventually stretchered off with a damaged Achilles tendon after three opponents were booked for fouling him. Sidelined for a month due to injuries sustained in that match, Wormull returned to play 20 minutes as a substitute before joining Rushden for a fee of £50,000 later that same week. BBC Sport's 2000–01 Football Conference preview said that Dover would miss him, a view later echoed by then assistant manager Clive Walker, who described the 1999–2000 season as [...] "a year when we had players like Simon Wormull, Joe Dunne and Dave Clarke in the team. <b>In</b> <b>all</b> <b>honesty,</b> we weren't far away from having a side good enough to win the division.

On March 2, 2011, Martin, Luke, McKee and Billboard filed a lawsuit in which they accused the brothers of making defamatory and libelous statements about them.

It was {{actually}} double reverbed; the gated reverb was only on the snares and the toms, {{and the rest of}} the kit as a whole had another plate reverb, which came off the Lexicon 960, for smoothing it out. Swivel said that it actually took him five minutes. According to him, the sound obtained was [...] "a little unorthodox" [...] and therefore, he tried to refine it. Beyoncé thought that it was better the way Swivel did it originally. Swivel commented, [...] "... and <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>honesty,</b> whatever works first is usually going to work best. You end up finding something you like about it, and that's where the emotional attachment to a sound comes into play." [...] Swivel often replaces or augments sounds with samples, trying to realise the producer's vision. Similarly in [...] "I Care", he added a couple of kicks underneath the original kick and pitched them down an octave, so that [...] " [...] could not hear them but could feel them on big speakers." [...] Swivel further said that it started with [...] "a dark, almost warehouse‑sounding" [...] kick, and he then added a little thump to it.|$|E

[...] The Telegraph commented on how Tonight: Franz Ferdinand is a melody-packed re-affirmation of everything that has made the band so popular hitherto, but with a highly contemporary-sounding, keyboard-driven edge. The Trades stated that [...] "this [...] is an evolutionary step for the band rather than a revolutionary one. Smart and danceable, Tonight: Franz Ferdinand proves that Franz Ferdinand are the masters of dance-rock."

Faridul Anwar Farinordin of the New Straits Times said, [...] "rest assured, fans will surely grab this one" [...] and selected [...] "Oops!...

Christy Lemire of the Associated Press stated that it was premature for Spears to release a greatest hits album compilation after only five years, but highlighted [...] "I'm a Slave 4 U", [...] "Toxic" [...] and [...] "Everytime".
