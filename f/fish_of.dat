40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} carried out {{to examine the effects}} of certain factors on {{preference}} and consumption pattern for some forms <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> in Oyo state, Nigeria. The data collected showed that households can be grouped, into low, middle and high income groups and the analysis revealed that majority of the households in the study area fell within the low income group and this group spent a higher percentage of their income on fish. The study revealed that household size, educational status of household head, taste <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> availability <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> ease <b>of</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> income <b>of</b> household head had significant effects on the preference and consumption pattern <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> in the study area. The result revealed that majority of the households (about 50 %) preferred frozen form <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> and this was followed by fresh water fish while a few made smoked fish their choice. It was found out that factors which were significant to frozen <b>fish</b> include availability <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> household size, ease <b>of</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> freshness <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> while those significant to fresh water include educational status, level of household head, taste <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> cleanliness <b>of</b> <b>fish</b> and factors significant to smoked <b>fish</b> include availability <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> ease <b>of</b> preparation <b>of</b> <b>fish,</b> household size and freshness <b>of</b> <b>fish...</b>|$|R

5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a depth of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded {{at a depth of}} 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other <b>fish</b> <b>of</b> the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis). Some members of this family have been recorded from depths of more than 6000meters.|$|E
5|$|Anchoring near Darwin Bay, Beebe {{made his}} first attempt at {{studying}} sea animals in their native environment by descending into the ocean in a diving helmet. Beebe continued to perform helmet dives throughout his Galápagos expedition, documenting several previously unknown sea animals. In addition to his helmet dives, Beebe applied the same method of research that he had pioneered in the tropics to a small area of ocean, sailing in circles around it for ten days {{with the intention of}} documenting all actions and interactions of marine life within that area. This study yielded a collection of 3,776 <b>fish</b> <b>of</b> 136 species, many of them also new to science.|$|E

Herring is often served at the kiddush that follows synagogue services on Shabbat, especially in Ashkenazi communities. In the Russian immigrant community it may be served as a light meal with boiled potatoes, sour cream, dark breads and schnapps or vodka.|$|E

5|$|Many {{fish are}} covered with highly {{reflective}} scales, giving the appearance of silvered mirror glass. Reflection through silvering is widespread or dominant in <b>fish</b> <b>of</b> the open sea, especially those {{that live in the}} top 100 metres. Where transparency cannot be achieved, it can be imitated effectively by silvering to make an animal's body highly reflective. At medium depths at sea, light comes from above, so a mirror oriented vertically makes animals such as fish invisible from the side. Most fish in the upper ocean such as sardine and herring are camouflaged by silvering.|$|E

Until the early 20th century, Māori also referred to the North Island as Aotearoa, (commonly translated as 'long white cloud'); in modern Māori usage this has become the name for the whole country.|$|E

5|$|Pettigrew State Park is home {{to several}} species of birds of prey. Ospreys build their nests in {{the tops of the}} tallest trees in the park and feed on the {{abundant}} <b>fish</b> <b>of</b> Lake Phelps. The population of bald eagles is increasing and they are occasionally seen over the park. At least three species of owl, the great horned owl, barred owl and eastern screech owl, make their home in the forests of the park, as do red tailed and red shouldered hawks. American kestrel and northern harriers also find suitable habitats at Pettigrew State Park.|$|E
5|$|Rivers {{and streams}} in the Colorado basin were once home to 49 species of native <b>fish,</b> <b>of</b> which 42 were endemic. Engineering {{projects}} and river regulation {{have led to}} the extinction of four species and severe declines in the populations of 40 species. Bonytail chub, razorback sucker, Colorado pikeminnow, and humpback chub are among those considered the most at risk; all are unique to the Colorado River system and well adapted to the river's natural silty conditions and flow variations. Clear, cold water released by dams has significantly changed characteristics of habitat for these and other Colorado River basin fishes. A further 40 species that occur in the river today, notably the brown trout, were introduced during the 19th and 20thcenturies, mainly for sport fishing.|$|E
5|$|S. ciliata is a benthic {{carnivore}} {{that feeds}} predominantly on polychaetes and various crustaceans. Like {{other species of}} Sillago, the diet of the species {{is related to the}} size and age of the individual, with three distinct size classes identified in a study conducted in Botany Bay, NSW. The smallest <b>fish</b> <b>of</b> 0–10cm take large amount of amphipods and few polychaetes, while fish between 11 and 20cm consume mostly neried polychaetes and few amphipods. The largest fish over 21cm take large amounts of bivalve molluscs and shrimps of the genus Callianassa.|$|E

5|$|S. ciliata is most {{commonly}} called the 'sand whiting' {{in reference to}} its preference for sandy substrates compared to {{some members of the}} genus which prefer muddy, silty, or grassy substrates. Other common names include the 'blue-nose whiting' in reference to the colour of the nose in <b>fish</b> <b>of</b> larger sizes, and 'summer whiting', a name often applied to S. analis as well. This name is applied to these species as they move from deeper offshore waters into shallow beach and estuarine waters in summer, where they become a target for recreational fishers.|$|E

5|$|The Canadian Rockies {{ecoregion}} supports 70 mammals, 16 reptiles and amphibians, 168 birds, and 41 fish species. There is a {{high concentration}} of raptors in the area, bald eagles are a common sight near Lake Coeur d'Alene in December and January when kokanee spawn. The most common fish present in area lakes is the Washington-native rainbow trout, which is the official <b>fish</b> <b>of</b> Washington state. Big game common in eastern Washington include black and grizzly bears, caribou, Rocky Mountain elk, bighorn sheep, and cougar. Whitetail deer, mule deer, and moose are also found in abundance. The gray wolf population has been making a recovery in the Inland Northwest. As of June 2016, there are 16 wolf packs in eastern Washington. In August 2016, photo evidence confirmed a solitary wolf in Mount Spokane State Park.|$|E
