5|$|Having {{captured}} Jerusalem and the Church of the Holy Sepulchre, the crusading vow had hence been fulfilled. However, {{there were}} many who <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home</b> before reaching Jerusalem, and many who had never left Europe at all. When {{the success of the}} crusade became known, these people were mocked and scorned by their families and threatened with excommunication by the Pope. Many crusaders who had remained with the crusade all the way to Jerusalem also went home; according to Fulcher of Chartres, {{there were only a few}} hundred knights left in the newfound kingdom in 1100. Godfrey himself only ruled for one year, dying in July 1100. He was succeeded by his brother, Baldwin of Edessa, the first person to take the title King of Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|As public anger {{continued}} to snowball, citizens started public demonstrations. On many nights, the rallies turned into confrontations with the violent police. When candles had burned out and children <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home</b> with their parents, many protesters were often attacked by riot-control policemen.|$|E
25|$|In {{a botched}} {{electrocution}} at Sing Sing in 1903, Fred Van Wormer was electrocuted and pronounced dead, but, upon {{arrival in the}} autopsy room, he was seen to be breathing once again.

25|$|Hawley's {{forces were}} largely intact and {{advanced}} on Stirling again once Cumberland arrived in Edinburgh on 30 January. Many Highlanders <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home</b> for the winter, leaving the Jacobites understrength and on 1 February, they abandoned the siege and retreated to Inverness. Cumberland's army entered Aberdeen on 27 February {{and both sides}} halted operations until the weather improved.|$|E
25|$|After {{a period}} in reserve, the {{division}} rejoined the offensive, forcing {{its way through the}} Forest of Mormal and across the River Sambre by plank bridges (4–5 November). The division continued the pursuit until it was relieved on 10 November, and the following day the Armistice with Germany came into force. Demobilisation began in December, and by March 1919 the division and its elements had been reduced to cadre and <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
25|$|The Kanya Ashram housed 130 {{girls on}} the day of the Janmashtami festival and many of the girls were eyewitnesses to the killing, as {{reported}} by Indian Express. A group of thirty to forty armed men surrounded the Ashram. Four of the assailants carried AK-47s and many others had locally made revolvers. Two of the four government provided security guards <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home</b> to eat, the assailants tied and gagged the two remaining guards.|$|E

25|$|Meeting at {{the reserve}} at 08:00 on Wednesday, the sailors learned of Fraser's remarks. Although not all were {{happy with the}} details of the new pay rates, it was agreed that their first demand had been met. By 08:10, the mutineers began to march to the gates of Philomel, where, upon being stopped by the Master-At-Arms, they asked to present their demands in {{relation}} to lower-deck committees and the foregoing of punishment for the mutiny to Commander Phipps. Although willing to listen to the sailors, the only response Phipps could give was that they should return to duty, accept punishment for their actions, and bring their concerns to official channels. While still at the gates, Doctor Martyn Finlay, the local member of parliament, addressed the mutineers and informed them that the government would consider their requests, with the prime minister to respond in two hours. Fraser arrived at the reserve at noon to personally address the sailors, but most <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home</b> by this point, with plans to reassemble the next morning. Those remaining listened as Fraser told them that queries regarding the pay package would have been better handled through official channels, and that the sailors should return to work and accept any punishment offered, but did not take his advice.|$|E
500|$|The {{decontamination}} failure ended {{plans to}} outfit {{some of the}} target ships for the 1947 Charlie shot and to sail the rest home in triumph. The immediate public relations problem was to avoid any perception that the entire target fleet had been destroyed. [...] On August 6, in anticipation of this development, Blandy had told his staff that ships sunk or destroyed more than 30 days after the Baker shot [...] "will not be considered as sunk by the bomb." [...] By then, public interest in Operation Crossroads was waning, and the reporters <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home.</b> [...] The failure of decontamination did not make news until the final reports came out a year later.|$|E

[...] "Tombstone Blues" [...] and [...] "It Takes a Lot to Laugh" [...] {{were included in the}} final album, but [...] "Positively 4th Street" [...] was issued as a single-only release. At the close of the July 29 session, Dylan attempted to record [...] "Desolation Row", accompanied by Al Kooper on electric guitar and Harvey Brooks on bass.

500|$|The {{scientific}} {{staff of}} six accompanying Endurance comprised the two surgeons, Alexander Macklin and James McIlroy; a geologist, James Wordie; a biologist, Robert Clark; a physicist Reginald James; and Leonard Hussey, a meteorologist [...] who would eventually edit Shackleton’s expedition account South. The visual record [...] {{of the expedition}} was the responsibility of its photographer Frank Hurley and its artist George Marston. The final composition of the Ross Sea party was hurried. [...] Some who left Britain for Australia to join Aurora resigned before it departed for the Ross Sea, and {{a full complement of}} crew was in doubt until the last minute. Within the party only Mackintosh and Joyce had any previous Antarctic experience; Mackintosh had lost an eye as the result of an accident during the Nimrod expedition and <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home</b> early.|$|E
500|$|Dee Dee {{claimed to}} have left the {{sessions}} without recording anything. [...] "We {{had been working for}} at least fourteen or fifteen hours a day for thirteen days straight and we still hadn't recorded one note of music," [...] he wrote in his autobiography. After supposedly hearing that Johnny had returned to New York, Dee Dee wrote that he and Marky Ramone booked a flight and returned home as well. [...] "To this day, I still have no idea how they made the album End of the Century, or who actually played bass on it." [...] Dee Dee's account contradicts much of the band's collective account from the 1982 Trouser Press interview, where the band stated that the only track that Johnny, Dee Dee and Marky did not play on was the cover of [...] "Baby, I Love You"; as the band, save for Joey, <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home</b> after cutting basic tracks {{for the rest of the}} album.|$|E
500|$|New Directions wins at Regionals, {{and hours}} later the {{ceremony}} {{is about to}} begin at City Hall, with their parents still hoping to prevent it from occurring. Rachel is waiting for Quinn, who <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home</b> to get her bridesmaid dress, to arrive. Quinn's car is hit by a truck as the episode ends. The wedding is called off, though the engagement remains on. In the episode [...] "Choke", Rachel auditions for NYADA in front of formidable judge Carmen Tibideaux (Whoopi Goldberg) but forgets the words to a song she has known since she was a child, and the audition abruptly ends. In [...] "Prom-asaurus" [...] Rachel is still upset about her choke and organises an [...] "anti-prom" [...] with Kurt, Blaine, Becky and Puck. She later realizes she is missing one of the best nights of her life and attends the prom with Finn and is voted Prom Queen by secret ballot (altered by Quinn), in a similar situation to Kurt the previous year. Rachel doesn't give up on her dream and sends Carmen Tibideaux fourteen messages and pesters her to give Rachel another chance at the audition, even driving to one of Tibideaux's tryouts with Tina. Her persistence (and Tina's help) persuade Ms. Tibideaux to come and see Rachel perform with New Directions at Nationals in Chicago (unbeknownst to Rachel). In [...] "Nationals" [...] Rachel performs Celine Dion's [...] "It's All Coming Back To Me Now" [...] and gets a standing ovation from the observing Carmen Tibideaux. New Directions return to McKinley as National Show Choir Champions and Rachel presents Mr. Schuester with the Teacher of the Year award. After Rachel graduates from McKinley, she finds out that she was accepted into NYADA. However, both Finn and Kurt were rejected from their colleges. At first, she decides to defer her acceptance so that she can help them both. However, Finn takes Rachel to the train station and sacrifices their relationship for Rachel's dreams. She gets off at Grand Central and walks down the streets of New York.|$|E

Clarkson had been offered soup and a cold meat platter, instead of the steak he wanted, because the hotel chef <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Although {{he never}} {{admitted}} it, he apparently planned a late arrival at New York {{so that he}} could refill his tanks and leave for Ireland after airport officials <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home</b> from work. Mechanical problems extended his unapproved inbound flight to nine days, which delayed him beyond the Atlantic [...] "safe weather window", and he returned to California. As a result of this trip, he named his plane Sunshine, however, federal officials notified Californian airfield officials that Sunshine was not airworthy and it was grounded for six months.|$|E
2500|$|Brown has a {{long-term}} friendship with his aide Jacques Barzaghi, {{whom he met}} in the early 1970s and put on his payroll. Author Roger Rapaport wrote in his 1982 Brown biography California Dreaming: The Political Odyssey of Pat & Jerry Brown, [...] "This combination clerk, chauffeur, fashion consultant, decorator, and trusted friend had no discernible powers. Yet, late at night, after everyone <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home</b> to their families and TV consoles, it was Jacques who lingered in the Secretary (of state's) office." [...] Barzaghi and his sixth spouse Aisha lived with Brown in the warehouse in Jack London Square; Barzaghi was brought into Oakland city government upon Brown's election as mayor, where Barzaghi first acted as the mayor's armed bodyguard. Barzaghi left Brown's staff in July 2004, six days after police had responded to his residence over a complaint of domestic violence.|$|E

2500|$|The crusaders {{remained}} in Egypt until August 1221. But Fitzwalter <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home</b> sick, probably at some earlier period. He {{spent the rest}} of his life peaceably in England, thoroughly reconciled to the government of Henry III. He must have by this time become well advanced in years. On 11 February 1225 Fitzwalter was one of the witnesses of Henry III's third confirmation of the great charter. In June 1230 he was one of those assigned to hold the assize of arms in Essex and Hertfordshire. According to Matthew Paris, he died on 9 December 1235, and was buried before the high altar at Priory Church in Little Dunmow. Administration of his goods and chattels was granted to his executors on 16 December 1235. He was described by Paris as a [...] "noble baron, illustrious by his birth, and renowned for his martial deeds".|$|E
2500|$|In 1939, {{war broke}} out in Europe and on 3 September 1939, war was {{declared}} between England and Germany. Defence Regulation 18b was issued, ordering the internment of anyone suspected of sympathizing with the Nazis. The Home Office then ruled that anyone born in Germany was classified as an enemy alien and all German males over age 16 were interned. In addition to the pupils who were interned, some of the pupils who <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home</b> that summer to visit their families in Nazi areas never returned and were not heard from again. With two hours' notice to pack their things, the school lost five men and 10 of the older boys, then, the cook and female students aged 16, before {{it was determined that}} [...] "good Germans" [...] who had fled the Nazis could be released, provided they remain in one place {{until the end of the}} war. This benefited the school greatly. Maths was taught by an astronomer, the music teacher had been an assistant to Ludwig Karl Koch, the stoker, formerly a senior producer at Berlin's Deutsches Theater, directed school plays.|$|E
2500|$|It took eight {{working days}} to shoot an episode, and days were {{regularly}} 14–20 hours long. Lauren Graham said: [...] "We filmed alongside The West Wing, and Aaron Sorkin shows {{are known for}} having the worst hours ever, they go on and on, but we were always there even after they <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>home,</b> because you couldn't change a word of the script." [...] The cast were required to be word-perfect in all the scenes, while also reciting large amounts of dialogue at speed. Matt Czuchry, who had a main role for the final three seasons, commented [...] "The pace of the dialogue was what made that show incredibly unique, and also incredibly difficult as an actor. To {{be able to maintain}} that speed, tone, and at the same time, try to make layered choices was a great experience to have early in my career. It really challenged me." [...] The combination of the difficult dialogue and long takes meant each scene had to be shot many times; Graham said in 2015: [...] "never before or since have I done as many takes of anything". Alexis Bledel recalled that one scene required 38 takes. Graham added, [...] "that show – as fun and breezy and light as it is – is technically really challenging".|$|E
