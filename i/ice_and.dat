5|$|Martin's inspirations {{included}} the Wars of the Roses and the French historical novels The Accursed Kings by Maurice Druon. A Song of <b>Ice</b> <b>and</b> Fire received praise for its diverse portrayal {{of women and}} religion, {{as well as its}} realism. An assortment of disparate and subjective points of view confronts the reader, and the success or survival of point of view characters is never assured. Within the often morally ambiguous world of A Song of <b>Ice</b> <b>and</b> Fire, questions concerning loyalty, pride, human sexuality, piety, and the morality of violence frequently arise.|$|E

The pair decided that they should produce two further books: <b>Ice</b> <b>and</b> Ices {{and a collection of}} David's early journalism. Like her book on bread, the scope for <b>Ice</b> <b>and</b> Ices grew the more David researched the subject. The compilation of existing essays and press articles took less time, and in 1984 An Omelette and a Glass of Wine was published, edited by Norman who became David's literary executor and edited further David works after the author's death.|$|E

Unlike the existing atmospheric icing sensors commercially available in market, which uses the axial loading for measuring <b>icing</b> load <b>and</b> <b>icing</b> rate, this new sensory system measures <b>icing</b> load <b>and</b> <b>icing</b> rate using the torque loading physics.

40|$|The {{topic of}} this thesis is Aircraft <b>Icing</b> <b>and</b> Aircraft <b>Icing</b> <b>and</b> Thermo-Mechanical Expulsion De-icing Technology. The main {{objectives}} are to investigate aircraft <b>icing</b> meteorology <b>and</b> effects on aircraft, <b>ice</b> protection systems <b>and</b> thermo-mechanical expulsion de-icing technology. Initially, the research project focuses on aircraft icing meteorology, <b>ice</b> accumulation <b>and</b> <b>icing</b> effects on flight safety. A {{basic understanding of}} aircraft icing is explained, including <b>icing</b> conditions <b>and</b> parameters, <b>ice</b> detection, <b>ice</b> accretion shapes, <b>and</b> <b>icing</b> effects in terms of different airframe surfaces. Ice protection systems are employed to prevent the <b>icing</b> hazards <b>and</b> ensure flight safety. The conventional <b>and</b> novel <b>ice</b> protection technologies are investigated and their characteristics are explained. Thermo-mechanical expulsion de-icing technology is selected as the research topic because of its typical characteristics of lower power required and high de-icing efficiency. Methods are explored to assess power consumption of thermo-mechanical expulsion de-icing system. In addition, a thermo-mechanical expulsion de-icing system architecture is explored for a civil aircraft and system power consumption is calculated. In order to explain the system design characteristics, conventional electro-thermal de-icing system architecture is designed to show the contrasts in terms of power consumption, de-icing efficiency, cost and mass. This novel ice protection system has better results in power consumption and de-icing performance, allowing long time flight in icing conditions. It can compensate the disadvantages of heavier mass and higher cost {{because there is no}} need to escape from <b>icing</b> encounters immediately <b>and</b> fuel penalties are reduced sequentially...|$|R
