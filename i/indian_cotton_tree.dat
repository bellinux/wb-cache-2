(= Dendrophthoe sp.), <b>Indian</b> silk <b>cotton</b> <b>tree</b> and <b>Indian</b> coral tree for nectar. They are often seen in {{plantations}} in forest areas.

50|$|Four main {{types of}} {{vegetation}} exist in this park. These are alluvial inundated grasslands, alluvial savanna woodlands, tropical moist mixed deciduous forests, and tropical semi-evergreen forests. Based on Landsat data for 1986, percent coverage by vegetation is: tall grasses 41%, short grasses 11%, open jungle 29%, swamps 4%, rivers and water bodies 8%, and sand 6%.There {{is a difference}} in altitude between the eastern and western areas of the park, with the western side being at a lower altitude. The western reaches of the park are dominated by grasslands. Tall elephant grass is found on higher ground, while short grasses cover the lower grounds surrounding the beels or flood-created ponds. Annual flooding, grazing by herbivores, and controlled burning maintain and fertilize the grasslands and reeds. Common tall grasses are sugarcanes, spear grass, elephant grass, and the common reed. Numerous forbs are present along with the grasses. Amidst the grasses, providing cover and shade are scattered trees—dominant species including kumbhi, <b>Indian</b> gooseberry, the <b>cotton</b> <b>tree</b> (in savanna woodlands), and elephant apple (in inundated grasslands).|$|R
