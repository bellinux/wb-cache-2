40|$|Previous studies {{identified}} a distinct region of interstital deletion at c 8 p 12 locus in colorectal cancer.

We investigated NRG 1, one of the genes in this region in colorectal tumourigenesis. To determine the expression profile of NRG 1, multiple approaches were utilised. Results from these studies identified deletion (loss of one allele) of NRG 1 in <b>early</b> colorectal <b>tumours.</b> Increased expression of NRG 1 protein was identified in advanced <b>tumours</b> compared to <b>early</b> colorectal <b>tumours</b> and adenomas.

40|$|Endostatin, a carboxy-terminal {{fragment}} of collagen XVIII, potently inhibits angiogenesis and tumour growth, presumably through induction of apoptosis in endothelial cells and/or inhibition of their migration.

The effects of rh-E treatment on hepatic tumour load and on <b>early</b> <b>tumour</b> cell seeding were evaluated. Recombinant human endostatin was most effective in reducing intrahepatic tumour growth when administered prior to tumour cell inoculation. Analysis of <b>early</b> <b>tumour</b> cell seeding by using [125 I]iododeoxyuridine-labelled C 26 cells or by in vivo microscopy showed that rh-E reduced tumour cell seeding in the liver sinusoids. Recombinant human endostatin did not inhibit tumour growth when administered later than 4 days after tumour injection. Pretreatment of human umbilical vein endothelial cells with rh-E in vitro reduced C 26 tumour cell adhesion under flow conditions two-fold as assessed by video microscopy and multiphoton laser scanning microscopy. Our results show that rh-E, in addition to antiangiogenic effects, reduces tumour cell adhesion in the liver sinusoids during the very early phases of metastasis formation. These data point towards a previously unknown mode of action of endostatin, that is, its ability to interfere with tumour cell seeding.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{immunohistochemical}} {{features of}} fetal haemoglobin cells and their distribution patterns in solid tumours, such as colorectal cancer and blastomas, suggest that fetal haemopoiesis may {{take place in}} these tumour tissues. These locally highly concentrated fetal haemoglobin (HbF) cells may promote tumour growth by providing a more efficient oxygen supply. METHODS AND RESULTS: Biomarkers of HbF were checked in transitional cell carcinoma (TCC) of the urinary bladder, assessing this as a new parameter for disease management. Fetal haemoglobin was immunohistochemically examined in tumours from 60 patients with TCC of the bladder. Fetal haemoglobin erythrocytes and erythroblasts were mainly clonally distributed in proliferating blood vessels and not mixed with normal haemoglobin erythrocytes. The proportion of such HbF blood vessels could reach {{more than half of}} the total number of vessels. There were often many HbF erythroblasts distributed in one-cell or two-cell capillaries and present as 5 – 15 % of cells in multi-cell vessels. This suggests a local proliferation of HbF-cell progenitors. Fetal haemoglobin cells were prominently marking lower grades of tumours, as 76 % (n 21) of the patients with G 1 pTa were HbFþ, whereas only 6. 7 % (n 30) of the patients with G 3 pT 1 -pT 2 a were HbFþ. CONCLUSION: Our results suggest that HbF, besides being a potential new marker for <b>early</b> <b>tumour</b> detection, might be an essential factor of <b>early</b> <b>tumour</b> development, as in fetal life. Inhibiting HbF upregulation may provide a therapeutic target for the inhibition of tumour growth...|$|E
40|$|Primary {{treatment}} of rectal cancer {{was the focus}} of the second St. Gallen European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) Gastrointestinal Cancer Conference. In the context of the conference, a multidisciplinary international expert panel discussed and voted on controversial issues which could not be easily answered using published evidence. Main topics included optimal pretherapeutic imaging, indication and type of neoadjuvant treatment, and the treatment strategies in advanced tumours. Here we report the key recommendations and summarise the related evidence. The treatment strategy for localised rectal cancer varies from local excision in <b>early</b> <b>tumours</b> to neoadjuvant radiochemotherapy (RCT) in combination with extended surgery in locally advanced disease. Optimal pretherapeutic staging is a key to any treatment decision. The panel recommended magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or MRI + endoscopic ultrasonography (EUS) as mandatory staging modalities, except for early T 1 cancers with an option for local excision, where EUS in addition to MRI was considered to be most important because of its superior near-field resolution. Primary surgery with total mesorectal excision was recommended by most panellists for some <b>early</b> <b>tumours</b> with limited risk of recurrence (i. e. cT 1 - 2 or cT 3 a N 0 with clear mesorectal fascia on MRI and clearly above the levator muscles), whereas all other stages were considered for multimodal treatment. The consensus panel recommended long-course RCT over short-course radiotherapy for most clinical situations where neoadjuvant treatment is indicated, with the exception of T 3 a/b N 0 tumours where short-course radiotherapy or even no neoadjuvant therapy were regarded to be an option. In patients with potentially resectable tumours and synchronous liver metastases, most panel members did not see an indication to start with classical fluoropyrimidine-based RCT but rather favoured preoperative short-course radiotherapy with systemic combination chemotherapy or alternatively a liver-first resection approach in resectable metastases, which both allow optimal systemic therapy for the metastatic disease. In general, proper patient selection and discussion in an experienced multidisciplinary team was considered as crucial component of care...|$|R
40|$|To compare local {{resection}} of <b>early</b> rectal <b>tumours</b> by transanal endoscopic microsurgery (TEM) and {{the conventional}} posterior trans-sphincteric approach (Mason's operation). Methods: The study group comprised 31 consecutive patients with <b>early</b> rectal <b>tumours</b> (18 villous adenomas, 13 adenocarcinomas) who underwent TEM in Kwong Wah Hospital, Hong Kong. The control {{group consisted of}} 51 patients with <b>early</b> rectal <b>tumours</b> (27 villous adenomas, 24 adenocarcinomas) who underwent Mason's operation in Peking Union Medical College Hospital, Beijing. Outcome measures included morbidity and mortality, operation time, recurrence rate and postoperative pathological staging. Results: Age, sex and pathological staging were similar in the two groups. The tumour size, operation time and blood loss were similar. The median distance from the anal verge was significantly higher in the TEM group (TEM/Mason = 8. 0 / 6. 4 cm, p = 0. 042). The postoperative resumption of food intake (TEM/Mason = 1 / 5 days, p = 0. 002) and the median hospital stay (TEM/Mason = 4 / 10 days, p = 0. 005) were significantly shorter in the TEM group. Analgesic intake was significantly less in the TEM group (TEM/Mason = 0 / 100 mg, p = 0. 0003). There was no operation-related mortality and the resection margins were clear in both groups. Two patients (3. 9 %) in the Mason's group developed postoperative wound infection, and two patients (3. 9 %) developed faecal fistulae. There was one secondary haemorrhage in the TEM group that required injection sclerotherapy. On median follow-up of 23 months, there was no tumour recurrence in the TEM group, whereas two patients (3. 9 %) in the Mason's group experienced recurrence during a median follow-up of 30 months.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the relationship between}} transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) -secreting T-regulatory (Tr) cells and anti-B 16 melanoma immunity, and studied the association of early cytokines expressed at tumour sites with the generation of Tr cells. A large number of CD 4 + Tr cells producing interleukin (IL) - 4, IL- 10 and TGF-β accumulated with functionally depressed CD 8 + cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) at tumour sites on day 20 after subcutaneous (s. c.) inoculation of B 16 tumour cells. Tr cells consisted of two populations, which were termed T helper 3 (Th 3) and Tr 1 cells. B 16 -infiltrating Tr cells strongly inhibited the generation of B 16 -specific T helper 1 (Th 1) cells in a TGF-β-dependent manner and were assumed to suppress effective generation of CTLs. In addition, B 16 cells markedly progressed in mice transferred adoptively by the cultured B 16 -infiltrating Tr cells compared with untreated mice. The capacity of these Tr cells to produce TGF-β was hampered by neutralizing anti-IL- 10 and partly anti-IL- 4 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) injected intralesionally during the early development of B 16 tumours, and this treatment markedly attenuated B 16 growth. Furthermore, a lesional injection of recombinant mouse IL- 10 at an <b>early</b> <b>tumour</b> site resulted in the vigorous progression of B 16 tumours.

40|$|Bone {{morphogenetic}} proteins (BMPs) {{are members}} of the transforming growth factor beta (TGFβ) super-family of signalling molecules. BMPs play crucial roles in developing and adult tissues during processes including proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). However, little is known regarding the role of BMPs in adult lungs during health and disease. In the present study, the role of BMP signalling in lung cancer and lung regeneration processes was examined. Early lung cancer tumours were isolated by laser capture microdissection from Kras G 12 D mouse lungs and microarray analysis was carried out on RNA from the purified populations of cells. Microarray and qPCR analyses revealed differential BMP pathway expression during <b>early</b> <b>tumour</b> formation. BMPR expression was decreased compared to normal lung epithelial cells while BMP 4, BMP 5, Smad 4 and Id- 1 expression were increased. We hypothesized BMPR-IB plays an anti-proliferative role during <b>early</b> <b>tumour</b> progression. To characterise the function of BMPR-IB in lung cells, the gene was cloned from mouse lung cDNA and an over-expression vector was generated. Viral and nonviral delivery methods were assessed for their ability to efficiently transfect normal and tumour-derived lung cells. Lipofectamine- 2000 was the most efficient non-viral method of gene delivery. This mode of transfection was utilised to transfect BMPR-IB gene into the human BEAS- 2 B cell line, which is devoid of endogenous BMPR-IB expression. The effects of BMPR-IB expression on proliferation, BMP signalling, and differentiation were assessed. BMPR-IB expression caused a reduction in viable cell number, an increase in non-viable cell number and an increase in cell death by apoptosis. Given the loss of expression of BMPR-IB at the early stages of cancer, these data suggest that BMPR-IB may have anti-proliferative properties during this stage in cancer. The role of BMP signalling in lung regeneration processes was also examined in the 1 -NN acute lung damage. BMP signalling was up-regulated during the inflammatory stage of lung damage.
