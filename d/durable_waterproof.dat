5000|$|The Boss of the Plains was a {{lightweight}} all-weather hat designed in 1865 by John B. Stetson for {{the demands of}} the American West. It was intended to be <b>durable,</b> <b>waterproof</b> and elegant. This design and the term [...] "Stetson" [...] eventually became all-but-interchangeable with what later became known as the cowboy hat.|$|E
50|$|Qirus were {{decorated}} by first cutting a shallow {{pattern on the}} surface of the cup, then filling the pattern with a <b>durable,</b> <b>waterproof</b> mixture of plant resin and pigment such as cinnabar. The finely incised lines would meet at intersection points that collaborated to create shapes such as triangles, squares, and diamonds. The shapes are organized in two to four horizontal registers.|$|E
40|$|The special {{dynamics}} {{defining the}} field of installations both {{from the point of}} view of technologies and new materials used to implement them, requires a permanent research concerning the components of tubing.

40|$|Below-grade {{structures}} such as parking lots, underground subway tunnels, and basements {{are growing}} in scale and reaching deeper below-ground levels. In this type of environment, they become subject to higher water pressure. The concrete material of the structures is exposed to wet conditions {{for longer periods of}} time, which makes the proper adhesion of waterproofing membranes difficult. Joint movements from increased structural settlement, thermal expansion/shrinkage, and physical loads from external sources (e. g., vehicles) make securing <b>durable</b> <b>waterproofing</b> challenging. While ASTM Guides, Korean Codes, and BS Practice Codes on below-grade waterproofing stress the importance of manufacturer specification for quality control, ensuring high quality waterproofing for the ever-changing scale of construction remains a challenge. This study proposes a new evaluation method and criteria which allow for the selection of waterproofing membranes based on specific performance attributes and workmanship. It subjects six different waterproofing membrane systems (installed on dry and wet surface conditioned mortar slab specimens with an artificial joint to different cyclic movement widths) to 300 cycles in water to demonstrate that inadequate material properties and workmanship are key causes for leakages...|$|R
5000|$|Concerned {{about the}} quality of {{bituminous}} materials used in built-up tar and asphalt roofs, Northern Chemical Company began marketing and installing single-ply rubber (EPDM) roof systems. The newly developed EPDM polymer was both <b>durable</b> and <b>waterproof.</b> It was a cost-effective solution to the increasing costs associated with built-up roofing. In the late 1970s and early 1980s, EPDM was {{one of the fastest growing}} roofing products and accounted for almost 40% of new and replacement roofs on commercial and industrial properties.|$|R

5000|$|Asian lacquerware, {{which may}} be called [...] "true lacquer", are objects coated with the treated, dyed and dried sap of Toxicodendron vernicifluum or related trees, applied in several coats to a base that is usually wood. This dries to a very hard and smooth surface layer which is <b>durable,</b> <b>waterproof,</b> and {{attractive}} to feel and look at. Asian lacquer is sometimes painted with pictures, inlaid with shell and other materials, or carved, as well as dusted with gold and given other further decorative treatments.|$|E
40|$|To achieve {{successful}} and <b>durable</b> bituminous <b>waterproof</b> membranes the designer {{must consider the}} properties and behaviour of both bitumen and reinforcement, the nature and behaviour of the surface {{to which it is}} applied, and the conditions of exposure or properties of the environment in which it must serve. The composite membrane has certain desirable properties, but is subject to several mechanisms of deterioration that can be allowed for or guarded against by design. The protection or shading of a membrane from solar radiation (CBD 65) has great value in extending its life, as does provision for drainage and the avoidance of trapped moisture. In some cases the occurrence of membrane failure can be prevented by a planned program of periodic maintenance. The manner of installation and quality of workmanship, however, are of fundamental importance to the performance of bituminous membranes.

5000|$|The {{history of}} Beacon Falls {{is tied to}} the series of {{manufacturing}} concerns that operated in the town's impressive brick factory buildings on North Main Street, adjacent to the Naugatuck River. The last and most successful of those concerns was the Beacon Falls Rubber Shoe Company (1898-1921). During the late 19th and early 20th centuries rubber manufacturing thrived in the Lower Naugatuck Valley. This followed the invention and 1844 patent, by Connecticut native Charles Goodyear, of a chemical process called Vulcanization to convert natural rubber into a <b>durable,</b> flexible, <b>waterproof</b> material. In the 1850s the American Hard Rubber Company built a brick factory in Beacon Falls, utilizing water power from the nearby Naugatuck River. The company made buttons, whip sockets, and powder flasks. After that company was acquired and moved to Long Island, the empty brick building was bought by the Home Woolen Company, which in the 1860s expanded and manufactured woolen shawls, popular at the time with men, women and Civil War soldiers. The Home Woolen Company thrived for 20-plus years until it became insolvent in 1887.|$|R
5000|$|Pelican {{flashlights}} (known as Pelican Lights) use Xenon, Halogen, and LED lamps. Many are safety approved {{with features}} such as valves, anti-shock systems, and battery polarity guards. The safety approvals include ETL (Edison Testing Labs), UL (Underwriters Laboratories), FM (Factory Mutual), CE-EX (ATEX Europe), CSA (Canadian Standards Association), MSHA (Mine Safety and Health Administration) [...] and the AUS (Australian Board of Approvals). These flashlights are popular with divers due to their common waterproof feature. They are also highly regarded by Merchant Mariners who need a flashlight to be <b>durable,</b> <b>waterproof</b> and rated for hazardous environments due to their work environment. The company also manufactures a line of LED tactical flashlights geared toward the law enforcement community.|$|E
50|$|New {{technology}} has enabled laser-cutting of wooden or acrylic jigsaw puzzles. The advantage of cutting with a laser {{is that the}} puzzle can be custom cut into any size, any shape, with any size (or any number) of pieces. Many museums have laser cut acrylic puzzles made {{of some of their}} more important pieces of art so that children visiting the museum can see the original piece and then assemble a jigsaw puzzle of the image that is also in the same shape as the piece of art. Acrylic is used because the pieces are very <b>durable,</b> <b>waterproof,</b> and can withstand continued use without the image fading, or the pieces wearing out, or becoming frayed. Also, because the print and cut patterns are computer based, lost pieces can be manufactured without remaking the entire puzzle.|$|E
5000|$|Domke {{initially}} {{opened a}} gas station on his land, as it abutted U.S. 23, and added some tourist cabins. However, his main goal {{was to create a}} natural history park. Domke stated that, [...] "our country has very elaborate and expensive zoos of our present animal life, but of prehistoric life, although much has been found, only a little has been placed before the general public." [...] So starting in 1935 Domke had his land drained, cleared, and trails constructed in preparation for the park. He also began experimenting with various formulas to construct his <b>durable</b> <b>waterproof</b> dinosaurs, {{with the help of the}} Huron Portland Cement Company. From 1935 to 1976 Domke constructed 24 exhibits at his Prehistorical Gardens. This roadside attraction also included a gift shop that sold snacks and souvenirs.|$|E
5000|$|In 1935, while {{pushing his}} concept of the $700 arplane, Vidal had seen the Atwood Duply Airmobile (civil {{registration}} number NC-15318), an experimental aircraft invented by Harry Atwood and test flown by Clarence Chamberlin. It was constructed with a seamless one-piece fuselage using [...] "Duply," [...] a steam-cooked laminate made from birch veneer strips impregnated with cellulose acetate. [...] After leaving the BAC, Vidal experimented from 1937 to 1940 with wood-resin composites using a thermosetting polymer process similar to Duramold {{under the banner of}} the Vidal Research Corporation. The experiments with the <b>durable</b> <b>waterproof</b> plywood material, said to have a greater tensile strength than a comparable thickness of aluminum, evolved initially into a small business producing only trays and dinghies. Vidal patented the process as [...] "Vidal Weldwood", variously described as [...] "cooked wood" [...] or [...] "molded plywood." ...|$|E
