(At the time, Grand Coulee Dam was the world’s largest dam.) One day, a crane operator failed to see him, swung a quarter-ton bucket of wet concrete into his side, and knocked him off the dam. He managed to reach around in midair, grabbed the bottom rim of the bucket, swung out with it, and when it came back in dropped into the middle of a patch of fresh concrete.|$|E
25|$|I've always {{believed}} that you play to highlight the song, not to highlight the player. The song is all that matters. There are two ways {{you can choose to}} go. You can try to be someone like Eddie Van Halen, who is a great guitarist, a virtuoso. Yet he doesn't make good records because what he plays is totally lost {{in the context of this}} band's music. Then there are guitar players like Chet Atkins, who weren't out there trying to show themselves off as guitarists per se, but were using the guitar as a tool to make good records. I remember loving Chet's work when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> but it was only later, when I really listened to his guitar parts, that I realized how much they were a part of the song's fabric, and how much you'd be going 'Oh, that song just isn't working' if they weren't there.|$|E

[...] "When we were making Toy Story", Docter said, [...] "everybody came up to me and said 'Hey, I totally believed that my toys came to life when I left the room.'

500|$|The band's {{debut album}} {{warranted}} a Parental Advisory label {{because of the}} album's lyrics. Many of Korn's first works are based on early experiences. The song [...] "Daddy" [...] was described by lead singer Jonathan Davis: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> I was being abused by somebody else and I went to my parents and told them about it, and they thought I was lying and joking around. They never did shit about it. They didn't believe it was happening to their son.... I don't really {{like to talk about}} that song. This is as much as I've ever talked about it..." [...] "Kill You" [...] was written about Davis's experiences as a child with his step mother.

500|$|Moffat {{joked that}} [...] "since <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> I've been {{thinking}} of Doctor Who monsters, just now when I do, it costs the art department [...] a lot of money". To create the rigid structure of the angels' dresses, prosthetics supervisors Rob Mayor soaked fabric in fibreglass resin, which was then painted over. Although they are never shown moving on screen, all of the Weeping Angels were played by actresses Aga Blonska and Elen Thomas wearing makeup and prosthetics. The actresses wore two distinct masks: one that was more docile looking, and one with fangs bared. Blonska later noted that [...] "I'm partly painted, partly glued into the costume, but it's quite comfortable." [...] Although the actresses were slightly [...] "wobbly" [...] when they stood still, the producers used digital effects to, in essence, freeze the angels on film. Moffat was {{very pleased with the}} results, and called them [...] "fantastic". Mulligan later called the effects [...] "so good" [...] and [...] "really creepy".|$|E
500|$|... "Hair" [...] {{was written}} and {{produced}} by Gaga and RedOne, {{and the name}} of the song was revealed through an interview with Vogue magazine in February 2011. On The Graham Norton Show, Gaga explained the origin of the song, which involves the analogy of her hair with freedom, and how that is the only part of her body she can change without anyone judging her. According to a press listening in February, [...] "Hair" [...] draws inspiration from Pat Benatar's '80s classic [...] "We Belong", while thematically focusing on empowering lyrics similar to those of [...] "Born This Way". Gaga elaborated on the song's inspiration further with a video posted on her Twitter account: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid,</b> I used to always come down the stairs of my parents' house, and they would say, 'Go back upstairs and brush your hair, change your clothes, you can't go out wearing that', and I felt like it was stifling my identity...

Bana was cast in October 2001, signing for an additional two sequels. Ang Lee felt obliged to cast Bana upon seeing Chopper, and first approached the actor in July 2001. The role was heavily pursued by other actors. Bana was also in heavy contention for Ghost Rider, but lost out to Nicolas Cage. Bana explained, [...] "I was obsessed with the TV show.

[...] It was widely reported Billy Crudup turned down the role. Johnny Depp and Steve Buscemi were reported to be under consideration for the lead.

500|$|A year {{prior to}} {{recording}} the album, jazz producer Tommy LiPuma and an unnamed keyboardist tried out some ideas {{for five days}} with Paul McCartney at McCartney's home studio in East Sussex. Featuring just vocals and piano, the trio [...] "put about 15-20 songs on tape", to see what tracks would work. Around this time, an unknown McCartney original was recorded, {{with the help of}} engineer Geoff Emerick. The songs that McCartney would work on were voted upon democratically: McCartney comments, [...] "I pulled up some [...] from my memories, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>a</b> <b>kid</b> and we had family sing-songs, which was the original inspiration for the whole idea, I said to Tom, 'Let's look at these ones.

To this question Mars said [...] "It definitely sounds awesome. Right? Isn't that what matters? It's an awesome song! I don't know how to tell you that more". In another interview, this time for Rolling Stone, he explained that the track is about [...] "good old animalistic sex".

According to Smith, while her invented world was not perfect, it contains fewer problems than Earth has endured, such as disease and overpopulation. She wrote, [...] "basically, the indigenous life forms, appalled by these things that came through and started multiplying and spreading out, carrying their diseases and wars, tried to fix things for the humans...
