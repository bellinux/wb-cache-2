5|$|Among {{the bands}} that {{regularly}} played the university, including Cream, Jimi Hendrix, and Pink Floyd, they were particularly impressed by The Crazy World of Arthur Brown, and recruited an organist, Nick Pearne, {{to match the}} format of Arthur Brown's band. Along with two female dancers, the initial line-up was Hammill on guitar and vocals, Smith on drums, wind instruments and vocals, and Pearne on organ (though he did not initially have an instrument). According to Smith, the band initially played as a two-piece, with Smith occasionally using a typewriter as a percussion instrument; their first gig as a three-piece was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> union, which lasted five minutes before the group's amplifiers blew up.|$|E
5|$|By {{her junior}} year, Rodham became a {{supporter}} of the antiwar presidential nomination campaign of Democrat Eugene McCarthy. In early 1968, she was elected president of the Wellesley College Government Association and served through early 1969. Following the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., Rodham organized a two-day student strike and worked with Wellesley's black students to recruit more black students and faculty. In her student government role, she played a role in keeping Wellesley from being embroiled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> disruptions common to other colleges. A number of her fellow students thought she might some day become the first female President of the United States.|$|E

5|$|Similarly {{to other}} Brazilian universities, Unicamp offers no {{large-scale}} in-campus housing, and most students live either near the campus or in Campinas. A student tradition in Brazil, {{inherited from the}} Portuguese universities, is the república, a fraternity-style private housing where multiple students rent large houses or apartments and live together. Dues to the suburban campus and {{the large number of}} students coming from other cities, repúblicas play a key role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> life, serving as centers for social life, parties and also study and work areas. While some repúlicas have existed for decades, sometimes moving from one house to another, most are formed by students in the same or similar classes, and last for a few years.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{was to determine the}} relationship of resilience and perceived stress with life satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> of success and failure. The research sample consisted of 120 who were selected from among <b>the</b> <b>students</b> of success and failure through the random sampling method. To collect the data, Resilience Scale, Perceived Stress Scale and Life Satisfaction Scale were used. The results showed that resilience and perceived positive stress are positively related to life satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> of success and failure (P< 0. 01). Also, perceived negative stress is negatively related to life satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> of success and failure (P< 0. 01). The result of multiple regression showed that psychological resilience and perceived stress explained 31 and 49 percent of variance of life satisfaction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>students</b> of success and failure, respectively. The results that increase of resilience, and decrease of stress become more satisfied leads to more satisfaction causes they feel better and developed resources for living well...|$|R

5|$|The Darkside, which derives {{its name}} {{from a lack of}} street lights when {{students}} first began to move to the area, is bounded by Stewart Street to the south, Brown Street to the west, Woodland Cemetery to the east and Wyoming Street to the north.

This is not due to any university policy, but rather the preference of seniors, who select houses first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> housing lottery due to their larger number of credit hours.|$|E
5|$|The Department Theatre {{presents}} {{a season of}} four professionally designed, produced and directed productions each year that serve as a laboratory for students to put their learning into practice.

In addition to Main Stage productions students write, direct and perform productions <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Student</b> Theatre Lab Studio, the annual New Plays Festival, and the summer Alternative Theatre Festival. The summer Alternative Theatre Festival includes a development project of a new work by an established playwright, a faculty directed piece, one student directed piece, and may include Alumni showcase and reunion productions.|$|E

The protests, accompanied by a U.S.-imposed crackdown on those considered communists, led to violent clashes between protesters and police in February 1948, in which Castro was badly beaten. At this point his public speeches took on a distinctively leftist slant, condemning the social and economic inequalities of Cuba, something in contrast to his former public criticisms, which had centered on condemning corruption and U.S. imperialism.|$|E

5|$|Greek life at UVA began a {{few decades}} after the school's {{establishment}} in 1819. Before this time social life at the university was fixed around debating societies; the now-defunct Patrick Henry Society, for instance, initially had a membership nearly equal {{to the size of}} the student body. In the 1850s the first fraternities began to appear and assumed a significant role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> body's social landscape. In the following decades, the university became the birthplace of two national fraternities and saw many more fraternity chapters chartered. The twentieth century saw the system expand even more to include professional fraternities, social sororities, local fraternities, and black fraternities and sororities. Moving into the 2000s, several new social Greek organizations were founded, and multicultural organizations began to rise to prominence.|$|E

She slips and falls onto some glass bottles which break and cut her stomach. Loretta is horrified {{when she is}} left scarred by the glass. Her boss sacks her, because her scars have {{rendered}} her unattractive, and Loretta is given a job in Tan & Tumble by Ash Roy (Junade Khan). Loretta develops a crush on Ravi Roy which makes his brother Ash jealous. After Loretta catches Ravi being violent towards his sister Leila (Lena Kaur) she distances herself from him and Ash starts flirting with her. Ash kisses Loretta and Ravi sees it and lashes out at. This leads an angry Ravi to fight in an illegal boxing match. After Ravi taunts Ash he punches Ravi, who was diagnosed with an aneurysm, and Ravi falls into a coma. Loretta explains to Kris Fisher (Gerard McCarthy) and Anita Roy (Saira Choudhry) that Ash tried to kiss her, which Kris believes and Ash tries to deny.|$|E
5|$|Norio Tsukudani based Himegoto on {{an earlier}} four-panel manga she drew for fun during her time as a student. At that time, the main {{characters}} {{that make up the}} student council were instead members of the drama club. However, Tsukudani decided to change this when developing Himegoto to be serialized in Ichijinsha's Waai! magazine, and she decided {{it would be easier to}} manage a cross-dressing character if he was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>student</b> council. Before creating Himegoto, Tsukudani read various works of fiction that featured cross-dressing boys, but many of them featured the boys being paired with other boys. When she proposed the idea of Himegoto, she wanted to pair a cross-dressing boy with girls, which Tsukudani herself wanted to read. In this way, she thought that a variety of different people would enjoy it.|$|E
