40|$|Pavement {{grooving}} {{has been}} used on highways as means to reduce <b>hydroplaning</b> and wet-weather accident occurrences. The need for pavement grooving arises because a plane pavement surface with little macrotexture generally has low <b>hydroplaning</b> speed and low frictional resistance {{at the onset of}} <b>hydroplaning.</b> This paper describes the use of a three-dimensional finite-volume <b>hydroplaning</b> simulation model to determine the <b>hydroplaning</b> speed associated with a particular groove design. Pavements of transverse and longitudinal orientations are studied and groove widths between 1 and 10 mm, groove depths between 1 and 10 mm and groove center-to-center spacing between 5 mm and 25 mm are considered. It is found that <b>hydroplaning</b> speed increases with increasing groove width and depths and decreasing center-to-center spacing. The concept of <b>hydroplaning</b> risk is introduced as a mean to evaluate the risk associated with a particular groove design. This allows pavement engineers or designers {{to be aware of the}} safety margin against <b>hydroplaning.</b> The risk of <b>hydroplaning</b> can be defined as the probability of <b>hydroplaning</b> occurrence for the design vehicle type traveling at the design speed on the section of road concerned under the given pavement conditions (i. e. pavement grooving design) and environmental conditions (such as water film thickness on the pavement surface). This paper next discusses the effect of pavement groove deterioration on <b>hydroplaning</b> risk. Using pavement groove deterioration obtained from experiments, it is found that the as the pavement grooves deteriorate, the <b>hydroplaning</b> speed offered by the pavement decreases and the risk of <b>hydroplaning</b> increases...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Aircraft tire is an {{important}} subassembly of aircraft, which is related to its safety tightly, especially for civil aircraft. Moreover, <b>hydroplaning</b> of aircraft tires is often a contributing factor in take-off and landing overrun and veeroff accidents. Therefore the study on them is imperative. For studying the <b>hydroplaning</b> of aircraft tire, a 2 D finite element model of aircraft tire is developed by using TYABAS software, and then a 3 D patterned tire model is presented. The <b>hydroplaning</b> of aircraft tire is analyzed by generally coupling an Eulerian finite volume method and an explicit Lagrangian finite element method. The <b>hydroplaning</b> speeds are investigated, which is a key factor of <b>hydroplaning.</b> Results indicated that the <b>hydroplaning</b> speed increases with the increment of inflation pressure; the <b>hydroplaning</b> speed decreases with the increment of the footprint aspect ratio...|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydroplaning,</b> as well known, greatly affects safety {{since it}} leads {{to the loss of}} contact between the tyre and the road, {{preventing}} the vehicle from responding to control inputs such as steering, braking and acceleration. Sensorised tyres developed in recent years have proved to be able to detect <b>hydroplaning</b> risks in terms of proximity to the so-called <b>hydroplaning</b> speed. The availability of such devices can push towards the development of control systems that are able to preserve vehicle stability and directionality also close to <b>hydroplaning</b> onset. This paper presents results relevant to the identification of <b>hydroplaning</b> proximity through smart tyres and describes an experimental campaign focused on the identification of the lateral response of tyres while approaching the <b>hydroplaning</b> speed...|$|R

Venizelos, impressed by the potential of air warfare, suggested that Greece should take advance of this new weapon. The following months a French military mission took up the development of Greek aviation by creating a fleet of four Maurice Farman MF.7 airplanes.

40|$|Recent {{research}} on pneumatic tire <b>hydroplaning</b> has been collected and summarized {{with the aim}} of describing what is presently known about the phenomena of tire <b>hydroplaning.</b> A physical description of tire <b>hydroplaning</b> is given along with formulae for estimating the ground speed at which it occurs. Eight manifestations of tire <b>hydroplaning</b> which have been experimentally observed are presented and discussed. These manifestations are: detachment of tire footprint, hydrodynamic ground pressure, spin-down of wheel, suppression of tire bow wave, scouring action of escaping fluid in tire-ground footprint region, peaking of fluid displacement drag, loss in braking traction, and loss of tire directional stability. The vehicle, pavement, tire, and fluid parameters of importance to tire <b>hydroplaning</b> are listed and described. Finally, the hazards of tire <b>hydroplaning</b> to ground and air-vehicle-ground performance are listed, and procedures are given to minimize these effects...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Hydroplaning,</b> {{also known}} as aquaplaning, is the {{condition}} where a layer of water builds up between the tire and road surface. <b>Hydroplaning</b> occurs when the tread pattern cannot channel away enough water at an adequate rate to ensure a semi-dry footprint area. <b>Hydroplaning</b> is more prevalent with wider tires and at higher speeds. When <b>hydroplaning</b> occurs, the tire effectively [...] "floats" [...] above the road surface on a cushion of water - and loses traction, braking and steering, creating a very unsafe driving condition. When <b>hydroplaning</b> occurs, there is considerably less responsiveness of the steering wheel. The correction of this unsafe condition is to gradually reduce speed, by merely lifting off the accelerator/gas pedal.|$|R
40|$|<b>Hydroplaning</b> {{characteristics}} {{is one of}} the key {{functions for}} safety driving on wet road. Since <b>hydroplaning</b> is a complex phenomenon involving coupling between tire deformation and surrounding fluids, implementation of three-dimensional numerical methods have been slow and needs to wait until late nineties. The numerical analysis procedure to predict the onset of <b>hydroplaning</b> of a tire is proposed here, considering the vehicle velocity dependency. MSC. Dytran is used to solve coupled problems between tire deformations and surrounding fluid. A reference flame fixed on a moving car is used to simulate transient phenomena effectively. Complex geometry of tread pattern and rotational effect of a tire, which are important functions of <b>hydroplaning</b> simulation, and also dependency on vehicle velocity are included in the proposed procedure. To verify the feasibility of the procedure, predicted <b>hydroplaning</b> velocities for four different simplified tread patterns are compared with experiments measured at proving ground. A comparison supports the effectiveness of the numerical simulation of <b>hydroplaning.</b> Lastly, numerical examples for the newly developed tires are also presented...|$|R

40|$|<b>Hydroplaning</b> {{represents}} a threat for riding safety since {{a wedge of}} water generated at the tire-road interface can lift tires from the ground thus preventing the development of tangential contact forces. Under this condition directionality and stability of the vehicle can be seriously compromised. The paper aims at characterizing the tire lateral response while approaching the <b>hydroplaning</b> speed: several experimental tests were carried out on a special test track covered with a 8 -mm high water layer using a vehicle equipped with a dynamometric hub on the front left wheel. A series of swept sine steer maneuvers were performed increasing the vehicle speed {{in order to reach}} a full <b>hydroplaning</b> condition. Variations of tire cornering stiffness and relaxation length were investigated while the vehicle approaches the <b>hydroplaning</b> speed. Experimental tests stated that a residual capability of generating lateral forces is still present also close to the full <b>hydroplaning</b> condition...|$|R

The three-dimensional SST k ω − coupled with the Volume of Fluid (VOF) model was applied to numerically simulate the air-water two phase flow with free surface in tire <b>hydroplaning.</b> Based on the model of <b>hydroplaning,</b> the design of tire pattern rib and lateral grooves on tire <b>hydroplaning</b> were analyzed. Analysis shows that tire has a high pressure induced by water impact in the front of footprint; water flow is inclined to tire sidewall.

40|$|A cost {{effective}} design preference for widening roadway sections is to expand lanes {{to the outside}} with a continuous cross slope, rather than expand and slope lanes to the inside. This preference increases the water film thickness along the cross slope and raises concern regarding <b>hydroplaning</b> potential. FDOT and University of South Florida developed the software, HP, a <b>hydroplaning</b> assessment tool, to better predict <b>hydroplaning</b> potential using roadway parameters such as pavement type, pavement temperature, lane width, lane slope and longitudinal slope. The program has two components (1) a methodology to predict water film thickness (WFT) on the pavement being analyzed; and (2) a methodology to predict potential <b>hydroplaning</b> speed given the WFT determined. <b>Hydroplaning</b> potential is compared to the predicted driver’s speed, which is a factor of the design speed combined with the predicted driver’s speed reduction due to the visual impairment caused by a rainfall event. Predicted driver speed reductions were obtained using a driving simulator to measure driver’s response during simulated rain events. The results were calibrated to real-life driving data collected on Florida’s interstate system around the state. Analyzing the <b>hydroplaning</b> potential allows designers to better quantify the risk associated with wide section roadways having a continuous cross slope and decide when it would is beneficial to break the slope to decrease risk. Identification of recently approved, wider Florida typical sections with design speed restrictions will be discussed and complemented by an HP demonstration and sample problem discussion...|$|R
