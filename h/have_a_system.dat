5|$|Broaching {{is often}} {{impossible}} without the specific broaching or keyway machines unless you <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> {{that can be}} used in conjunction with a modern machining centre or driven tooling lathe; these extra bits of equipment open up the possibility of producing keyways, splines and torx through one-hit machining.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the state, federal {{agencies}} which allow alcohol sales do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of liquor licenses or alcoholic beverage control boards, but instead simply {{award contracts to}} business per federal procurement laws. New Jersey does not consider municipal ordinances to be criminal offenses, and so open container laws cannot be enforced in federal enclaves under the Assimilative Crimes Act. Public consumption of alcohol is allowed on federal lands, except when in an automobile, or when the park superintendent has prohibited open containers in an area. For example, it is legal to consume alcoholic beverages {{on the beach at}} Sandy Hook.|$|E
5|$|While {{the layout}} of {{internal}} genital ducts and openings of the female genitalia depends upon the taxonomic group that insect belongs to, the internal female reproductive system of all lepidopterans consists of paired ovaries and accessory glands which produce the yolks and shells of the eggs. Female insects <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of receptacles and ducts in which sperm is received, transported and stored. The oviducts of the female join {{together to form a}} common duct (called the 'oviductus communis') which leads to the vagina.|$|E

5|$|Previously {{the police}} used a {{decentralized}} {{information technology system}} developed during the mid-1990s. As late as 2012 servers were still being run with Windows NT 4.0 from 1996 and log-on times were typically twenty minutes. The new IT-system D#2 was introduced in 2011 and will have been taken into use by all divisions by 2012. D#2 will be operated by ErgoGroup and will have two redundant server centers. Personnel {{have access to the}} system via thin clients. The police <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> to raise a national alarm to close border crossings and call in reserve personnel. The one time it was activated the message was not received by any of the intended recipients. Since 2009 it has been possible to report criminal damage and theft of wallets, bicycles and mobile telephones without a known perpetrator(s) online.|$|E
25|$|Early Egyptian artists did <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> for {{maintaining}} dimensions within artwork. They used a grid system {{that allowed them}} to create a smaller version of the artwork, and then scale up the design based upon proportional representation in a larger grid.|$|E
25|$|Turkish {{does not}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of {{grammatical}} gender {{and does not}} have any gender-specific pronouns. The Turkish singular third-person pronoun o (he/she/it) is completely gender-neutral and can be used to refer to masculine, feminine, and neuter nouns. The plural third-person pronoun onlar (they) is used the same way.|$|E

25|$|From 2007 onwards, {{homophobic}} chanting at football grounds was explicitly outlawed by the FA. Tottenham Hotspur <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> {{in place}} to allow fans to report any anti-gay chanting and Manchester City are the first Premiership club to have been recognised by pressure group Stonewall as a gay-friendly employer.|$|E
25|$|Off-board {{chargers}} can be {{as large}} as needed and mounted at fixed locations, like the garage or dedicated charging stations. Built with dedicated wiring, these chargers can handle much more power and charge the batteries more quickly. However, as the output of these chargers is DC, each battery system requires the output to be changed for that car. Modern charging stations <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> for identifying the voltage of the battery pack and adjusting accordingly.|$|E

25|$|Chronoception {{refers to}} how {{the passage of time}} is {{perceived}} and experienced. Although the sense of time is not associated with a specific sensory system, the work of psychologists and neuroscientists indicates that human brains do <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> governing the perception of time, composed of a highly distributed system involving the cerebral cortex, cerebellum and basal ganglia. One particular component, the suprachiasmatic nucleus, is responsible for the circadian (or daily) rhythm, while other cell clusters appear to be capable of shorter-range (ultradian) timekeeping.|$|E
25|$|Heavy land {{requires}} draining {{to reduce}} its water content to a level satisfactory for efficient plant growth. Heavy soils usually <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of permanent drains using either perforated plastic or clay pipes which discharge into a ditch. Mole ploughs are used to form small tunnels (mole drains) in the soil {{at a depth of}} up to 950mm (30in) at an angle to the pipe drains. Water from the mole drains seeps into the pipes and runs along them into a ditch.|$|E
25|$|Many {{animals that}} live on {{or in the}} sea consume flotsam by mistake, as it often looks similar to their natural prey. Plastic debris, when bulky or tangled, is {{difficult}} to pass, and may become permanently lodged in the digestive tracts of these animals. Especially when evolutionary adaptions {{make it impossible for}} the likes of turtles to reject plastic bags, which resemble jellyfish when immersed in water, as they <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> in their throat to stop slippery foods from otherwise escaping. Thereby blocking the passage of food and causing death through starvation or infection.|$|E

25|$|From 1999 to January 1, 2009, Saddle Brook had a public-access cable TV {{station with}} news bulletins (channel 77 on Cablevision and {{channels}} 38 and 39 on Verizon FiOS). This station, called SBC-TV, was created after Hurricane Floyd hit Saddle Brook in September 1999 so the town would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> for emergency alerts. The station {{was shut down}} in 2009 because of budget constraints. The station resumed operations in 2011 with an all-volunteer staff, airing Township Council meetings and providing information of Township services, events and activities via a scrolling message board.|$|E
25|$|The Tanana Athabaskans <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of matrilineal kinship. The Athabaskans loosely {{recognized}} {{membership in}} a larger bilateral group called regional band (or dialect group), but the more important social unit was the local band (or family group or family/hunting units). In the winter, the regional band might split up into smaller units, called local bands, each one made up of perhaps four nuclear families. The regional band might meet again at a predetermined place and time in mid-winter for a gathering ceremony called a potlatch, and then split up again for beaver and muskrat trapping.|$|E
25|$|Verb stems are inflected {{through a}} number of {{different}} processes: the initial consonant of the verb root changes according to a morphophonemic pattern of consonant mutations to mark present vs. non-present, and active vs. passive. Verbal roots may take a formative syllable or not depending on syntactic and prosodic factors. A nasal prefix may be added to the root to express reciprocality or middle voice. Some dialects, notably the eastern ones, <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of verb classes that take different series of prefixes. These conjugational categories have been lost in the Western dialects, although they existed in the Western areas in the colonial period as can be seen from Cárceres's grammar.|$|E

25|$|The owners closely {{watch the}} cricket's {{behavior}} {{for signs of}} discomfort, and adjust the diet to bring the fighters into shape. The crickets are mated with females before the fight, as the Chinese believe that, unlike other beings, male crickets become more aggressive after having sex. In Laufer's time the fighters were sorted in three weight classes; present-day Shanghai aficionados <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of nine classes from 0.51 to 0.74grams. Both sides in a fight should {{belong to the same}} class, thus before the fight the crickets are weighed on high-precision scales (huang). The units of cricket weight, zun and dian, are not used anywhere else.|$|E
25|$|Discussions {{are already}} {{underway}} for future expansions, {{in order for}} the metro network to also serve major transport hubs of the city, notably the Macedonia InterCity Bus Terminal (KTEL) and Macedonia International Airport. For the expansion towards the airport, the Attiko Metro company is considering the construction of an overground network or a monorail. The expansion to Kalamaria, a southeast borough of Thessaloniki, has already become part of the initial construction phase, while future expansions are considered and planned for Efkarpia to the north and Evosmos to the west. The strategic plan for the construction of the Thessaloniki Metro envisions that the city will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of 3 lines by 2018 or 2020 at the latest.|$|E
25|$|At {{the end of}} each season, {{clubs in}} the Bundesliga must apply to the German Football Federation (DFB) for a licence to {{participate}} again the following year; only when the DFB, who have access to all transfer documents and accounts, are satisfied that there is no threat of insolvency do they give approval. The DFB <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>system</b> of fines and points deductions for clubs who flout rules and those who go into the red can only buy a player after selling one for at least the same amount. In addition, no individual is allowed to own more than 49 percent of any Bundesliga club, the only exceptions being VfL Wolfsburg, Bayer Leverkusen and current Regionalliga Nordost member FC Carl Zeiss Jena should they ever be promoted to the Bundesliga as they were each founded as factory teams.|$|E
