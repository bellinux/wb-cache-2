Homer is encouraged until he notices his poster of Edison shows him sitting in the same type of chair. Bart points out that the chair is not featured on a list of Edison's inventions, meaning <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> anyone of this invention.|$|E

In February 2016, an undercover reporter filmed Van der Sloot confessing to Natalee Holloway's murder. The film shows Van der Sloot, in Dutch, laughing over how <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> the truth about the whole event and that he did in fact kill Natalee.

5|$|At {{his trial}} in Clearwater, Florida, Chandler {{said that he}} met the Rogers women and gave them directions, but he never saw them again except in {{newspaper}} coverage and on billboards. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> the authorities {{that he had seen}} the women again. He acknowledged that he was on Tampa Bay that nightthe police had evidence of three ship-to-shore telephone calls made from his boat to his home during the time frame of the murdersbut Chandler maintained that he was fishing alone. He claimed that he had returned home late because his engine would not start, which he attributed to a gas line leak. He said that he had called the Coast Guard and the Florida Marine Patrol, and had flagged down a patrol boat, but both were too busy to help. He said that he subsequently fixed the line with duct tape and returned safely to shore. However, there were no records of distress calls from Chandler to either the Coast Guard or the Marine Patrol that night, nor were there any Coast Guard boats on the bay the following morning that could have helped him. According to a boat mechanic, who testified for the prosecution, Chandler's explanation of repairing the boat's alleged gas leak was not tenable because the fuel lines in his boata Baylinerwere directed upward. A leak would have sprayed fuel into the air rather than into the boat, and the corrosive gasoline would have eaten away the adhesive properties of the duct tape Chandler maintained he had used to repair the purported leak. Under interrogation from Pinellas County prosecutor, Douglas Crow, Chandler then said he could not remember.|$|E

25|$|On July 18, 1855, Johnson passed word {{to a black}} porter in Bloodgood's Hotel, where Wheeler {{had locked}} her in with her children, {{that she wanted to}} escape her master's custody. He got word to William Still, {{chairman}} of the Vigilance Committee of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, who helped fugitive slaves. Later that day, as the full Wheeler party prepared to board the ferry, Still and abolitionist Passmore Williamson, secretary of the Society, reached the docks. Williamson told Johnson that she could choose freedom according to Pennsylvania law. While Wheeler argued, offered her a promise of freedom, and tried to prevent Johnson from leaving, five black dockworkers restrained him, and Williamson explained the state law to him. William Still quickly escorted Johnson and her children away by a coach, later taking them secretly to his house. <b>He</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> Williamson where they were, under the principles of compartmentalization used by the Vigilance Committee.|$|E

Not unlike his screen persona, his communication style frequently consisted of long silences with an occasional [...] "yup" [...] and [...] "shucks". He once said, [...] "If others have more interesting things to say than I have, I keep quiet." [...] According to his friends, Cooper could also be an articulate, well-informed conversationalist on topics ranging from horses, guns, and Western history to film production, sports cars, and modern art. He was modest and unpretentious, frequently downplaying his acting abilities and career accomplishments. His friends and colleagues described him as charming, well-mannered, and thoughtful, with a lively boyish sense of humor. Cooper maintained a sense of propriety throughout his career and never misused his movie star status—never sought special treatment or refused {{to work with a}} director or leading lady. His close friend Joel McCrea recalled, [...] "Coop never fought, he never got mad, <b>he</b> <b>never</b> <b>told</b> anybody off that I know of; everybody that worked with him liked him." ...|$|E

He drove Hicks-Beach home for about 8:00pm, not in his Mercedes-Benz, but in [...] "an old, dark and scruffy Ford", possibly the Ford Corsair he borrowed from Michael Stoop several weeks earlier.
