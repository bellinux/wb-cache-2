5|$|The {{water quality}} of the Big Butte Creek {{watershed}} is generally high, and it supports several species of trout and salmon. The watershed {{is also home to}} more than 152 species of birds, 63 species of mammals, 19 species of reptiles, and numerous plants. The Poverty Flats region was designated an Area of Critical <b>Environmental</b> <b>Concern</b> by the Bureau of Land Management in 1995 to protect several rare species of plants.|$|E
5|$|Producing {{plutonium}} in useful quantities for {{the first}} time was {{a major part of the}} Manhattan Project during World War II that developed the first atomic bombs. The Fat Man bombs used in the Trinity nuclear test in July 1945, and in the bombing of Nagasaki in August 1945, had plutonium cores. Human radiation experiments studying plutonium were conducted without informed consent, and several criticality accidents, some lethal, occurred after the war. Disposal of plutonium waste from nuclear power plants and dismantled nuclear weapons built during the Cold War is a nuclear-proliferation and <b>environmental</b> <b>concern.</b> Other sources of plutonium in the environment are fallout from numerous above-ground nuclear tests, now banned.|$|E
5|$|Reservoirs {{and ponds}} in the {{watershed}} of Spring Brook include the Spring Brook Intake, the Nesbitt Reservoir, the Watres Reservoir, and Maple Lake. The first three {{are used as}} drinking water reservoirs and the lakes also serve as flood protection. The Pennsylvania American Water Company owns all four lakes and several hundred acres of the surrounding land. There are flood levees {{at the mouth of}} the stream. There is some evidence of coal mining on a ridge overlooking the area in the stream's vicinity. However, residential encroachment on the stream's floodplain is a more significant <b>environmental</b> <b>concern.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{examine the}} {{influence}} of drivers 9 ̆ 2 <b>environmental</b> <b>concerns</b> on their preferences for different types of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs). Our empirical approach is built around {{the results of a}} large-scale survey among Dutch drivers, where preferences for electric vehicles are elicited through a choice experiment and <b>environmental</b> <b>concerns</b> are reflected in individual responses to Likert-type questions. On this basis, we develop advanced latent class models to study preference heterogeneity and its link to drivers 9 ̆ 2 socio-demographic background and <b>environmental</b> <b>concerns.</b> We find that <b>environmental</b> <b>concerns</b> are an important predictor of class membership and that highly concerned drivers tend to cluster in classes with a positive stand towards PEVs. High <b>environmental</b> <b>concerns</b> are positively associated with driver 9 ̆ 2 s age and education, while negatively related to d river 9 ̆ 2 s household income...|$|R
40|$|Following on from a {{quantitative}} (questionnaire- based) study into policy-making procedures and {{the consideration of}} <b>environmental</b> <b>concerns</b> therein within Australian government agencies, a further qualitative study was undertaken to identify opportunities for modifying and improving existing approaches and methodologies for strategic environmental assessment (SEA). Based on semi-structured interviews of senior public servants, an investigation of existing policy-making procedures, methods of incorporating <b>environmental</b> <b>concerns</b> into these procedures, and measures to improve the policy process to account better for <b>environmental</b> <b>concerns</b> was carried out. The {{results show that the}} variation in both agency policy-making procedures {{and the degree to which}} <b>environmental</b> <b>concerns</b> are incorporated into policy-making compel the selective application of existing and proposed SEA approaches to suit the required circumstances...|$|R
30|$|Many power {{projects}} and real state {{projects have been}} delayed because of environmental clearances from Government of India.

5|$|The {{rocks are}} home to over 70 species of animals and 340 species of plants, which {{includes}} over 200 species of wildflowers. Vernal pools atop the plateaus fill {{during the rainy season}} in winter and spring because the andesite is impermeable. The dwarf woolly meadowfoam, a species of wildflower, grows around these pools, and is endemic to the rocks. The pools are also one of only a few places where the federally threatened species of fairy shrimp, Branchinecta lynchi, can be found. To protect these and other threatened species, the Bureau of Land Management has listed the rocks as an Area of Critical <b>Environmental</b> <b>Concern</b> since 1984.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} {{increased}} <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> in the Soviet Union. In the mid-1950s, Soviet scientists began taking regular radiation readings near Leningrad, Moscow, and Odessa and collected {{data on the}} prevalence of strontium-90, which indicated that strontium-90 levels in western Russia approximately matched those in the eastern US. Rising Soviet concern was punctuated in September 1957 by the Kyshtym disaster, which forced the evacuation of 10,000 people after an explosion at a nuclear plant. Around the same time, 219 Soviet scientists signed Pauling's antinuclear petition. Soviet political elites did not share the concerns of others in Soviet Union, however; Kurchatov unsuccessfully called on Khrushchev to halt testing in 1958.|$|E
5|$|As a white-rot fungus, Panellus stipticus {{contains}} {{enzymes that}} {{are able to}} break down lignin, a complex aromatic polymer in wood that is highly resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of hydrocarbon rings is laccase, which catalyzes the addition of a hydroxyl group to phenolic compounds (polyphenols). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the bioremediation of land contaminated by organic pollutants, and to convert industrial wastes rich in toxic polyphenols. Panellus stipticus has been shown to reduce the phenolic concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plants—an <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> in many Mediterranean countries. In this study, a liquid culture of P.stipticus mycelia reduced the initial concentration of phenolic compounds by 42% after a 31-day incubation period. In a separate study, a P.stipticus culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental pollutant 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a polychlorinated dioxin.|$|E

5|$|Some of {{the most}} common trees that grow in the Big Butte Creek {{watershed}} include four species of fir, two species of pine, incense cedar, and western hemlock. The understory contains plants such as Pacific yew, Pacific madrone, chinquapin, and vine maple. Several invasive species {{have been reported in the}} Big Butte Creek watershed, such as Kentucky bluegrass, common bent, drooping brome, and redtop. The spread of these species is most likely due to overgrazing. Sensitive species that grow in the watershed include Howell's yampah, Egg Lake monkeyflower, clustered lady's slipper, green-flowered ginger, Mount Mazama collomia, and Detling's microseris. Mallow and popcorn flower have also been discovered in riparian zones. The Poverty Flats Area of Critical <b>Environmental</b> <b>Concern</b> (ACEC) is home to several rare species of plants, including Bellinger's meadowfoam, Howell's yampah, and Rocky Mountain woodsia.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} project became controversial as environmental protection non-governmental organizations (NGOs) drew public {{attention to a}} possible threat that may arise to seven species of bats. Subsequently, the NGOs alleged that the project is illegal, environmentally unsafe, financially not feasible, and technically questionable. Project legality was disputed because {{it is based on}} a 1999 environmental impact assessment (EIA), while Croatian legislation requires that EIAs must not be more than two years old. Flooding of Vilina Cave is cited as an <b>environmental</b> <b>concern,</b> while the financial issues are based on previous cost overruns by Hrvatska elektroprivreda—the state-owned company planning the development—in other projects. One objection to the technical aspects of the project is the possibility that the groundwater may trigger earthquakes. Opponents of the project have urged the Prime Minister of Croatia to cancel development of the plant.|$|E
5|$|Mouflon (Ovis aries orientalis) was {{introduced}} from 1962–1964, {{and a plan}} to release axis deer (Axis axis) in 1964 was prevented only by protests from the ranching industry, who {{said that they would}} damage crops and spread disease. The hunting industry fought back, and the back-and-forth between the ranchers and hunters eventually gave way to a rise in public <b>environmental</b> <b>concern.</b> With the development of astronomical facilities on Mauna Kea commencing, conservationists demanded protection of Mauna Kea's ecosystem. A plan was proposed to fence 25% of the forests for protection, and manage the remaining 75% for game hunting. Despite opposition from conservationists the plan was put into action. While the land was partitioned no money was allocated for the building of the fence. In the midst of this wrangling the Endangered Species Act was passed; the National Audubon Society and Sierra Club Legal Defense Fund filed a lawsuit against the Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources, claiming that they were violating federal law, in the landmark case Palila v. Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources (1978).|$|E

25|$|Japanese cuisine {{is heavily}} {{dependent}} on seafood products. Compared to other developed countries, the Japanese eat more fish than any of them, consuming about 27 kilograms of seafood per capita annually. An aspect of <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> is Japanese appetite for seafood, which might lead to depletion of natural ocean resources through overfishing. For example, Japan consumes 80% of the global supply of blue fin tuna, a popularly sought sushi and sashimi ingredient, which might lead to its extinction due to commercial overfishing. Another <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> is commercial whaling and the consumption of whale meat, since Japan is the world's largest market of whale meat.|$|E
25|$|The {{first major}} <b>environmental</b> <b>concern</b> was air pollution, with Halden {{experiencing}} the highest sulfur oxide content of any Norwegian town. The sulfite pulp used limestone, {{which made it}} impossible to capture the sulfur oxide. This was mitigated in 1978, when the pulp mill was rebuilt to instead use magnesium.|$|E

25|$|The {{wet cooling}} towers used in {{coal-fired}} power stations, etc. emit drift and fog {{which are also}} an <b>environmental</b> <b>concern.</b> The drift contains Respirable suspended particulate matter. In case of cooling towers with sea water makeup, sodium salts are deposited on nearby lands which would convert the land into alkali soil, reducing the fertility of vegetative lands and also cause corrosion of nearby structures.|$|E
25|$|One isothiazolinone, Sea-Nine 211 (4,5-dichloro-2-n-octyl-4-isothiazolino-3-one, DCOI), has quickly {{replaced}} tributyltin as the {{antifouling agent}} {{of choice in}} ship hull paint. A recent study reported the presence of DCOI in both port water and sediment samples in Osaka, Japan, especially in weakly circulating mooring areas. Of <b>environmental</b> <b>concern,</b> DCOI levels predicted in marinas now are considered a threat to various marine invertebrate species. Isothiazolinones also are extremely toxic to fish.|$|E
