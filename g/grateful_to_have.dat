25|$|The {{next night}} on Raw Is War, after teasing a quick face turn, the heel turn {{continued}} {{and he also}} altered his character considerably {{over the next few}} months, in a deliberate turn from the rebellious and anti-establishment character beloved by the fans, Austin became a whiny, temperamental primadonna who would complain incessantly when he felt he was not getting the respect from the fans and wrestlers that he deserved. He also developed an infatuation with McMahon, going to great lengths to impress him and even {{going so far as to}} hugging him and bringing him presents. McMahon, though visibly uncomfortable and wary by the attention, was still <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> Austin with him instead of against him. During a steel cage match with The Rock in a rematch for the title, Triple H came down to the ring with a sledgehammer and together with Austin viciously attacked The Rock and put him out of action. Austin further cemented his heel turn the following Thursday on SmackDown!, when during an interview with Jim Ross about his actions at WrestleMania thought Ross was denouncing their friendship and then proceeded to attack and brutally assault Ross. Austin and Triple H became a team and called themselves The Two-Man Power Trip.|$|E

500|$|The program {{received}} a lukewarm reception from critics. Chris Willman from the Los Angeles Times said the program's title was misleading because [...] "it's {{hard to find}} anything the slightest bit untraditional about [...] ". Willman commended the 1960s influence reminiscent of her father's Christmas songs and said the special was [...] "a good-enough live video counterpart" [...] to the album with an obvious inclusion of 'The Christmas Song'". John J. O'Conner of The New York Times gave it a negative review, saying, [...] "a couple of new songs are forgettable" [...] and describing Cole's performance as [...] "sweetly, and somewhat lifelessly", and the production as unable to leave a lasting impression on the viewers. O'Connor also said Cole's rendition of [...] "The Christmas Song" [...] was {{the highlight of the}} show and, [...] "Ms. Cole once again dips in the repertory of her incomparable father". He compared the program to [...] "Perry Como's Irish Christmas" [...] and said both had [...] "the same lulling level". Following Cole's death on December 31, 2015, PBS released a statement saying [...] "we are <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been able to capture [...] extraordinary artistry for generations to come" [...] through her Great Performances solo specials including her Christmas special.|$|E

500|$|In their {{development}} process, Boxleiter and Wohlwend both proposed {{and worked on}} each other's ideas, and would drop the ideas they found unexciting. Wohlwend said they often argued over aspects of their games, which he found normal and natural. Their labor as a team was divided in that Wohlwend always did the art and Boxleiter the programming, as reflective of their skills at the time. The pair agreed to an assessment of their partnership as [...] "left-brain right-brain", and saw {{the majority of their}} joint work as [...] "editing". Aside from the business aspects, they were <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the [...] "creative freedom" [...] to do their own work. Wohlwend appreciated the benefits of not doing contract work, but struggled with the relative [...] "isolation" [...] of having few colleagues, a low salary, and job instability. He disagreed with the [...] "cinematic action games" [...] he saw to be popular at the time and hoped to contribute more compelling ideas to the young industry. They thought of themselves as artists and of their work as experimental. Boxleiter and Wohlwend worked long hours when making the Flash games, which they found exciting and unsustainable. At Intuition, they worked on games such as Dinowaurs, Gray, Fig. 8, and Lifecraft and participated in at least six game jams. As of April 2010, they had created 10 games together.|$|E
500|$|In December 2008, reports {{speculated that}} Knight {{requested}} {{to be released}} from his contract and that [...] "they were working out the details" [...] at that time. In June 2009, after the conclusion of the fifth season of Grey's Anatomy, it was confirmed that Knight would not be returning for the show's sixth season. The actor stated the reason for his departure was due to a [...] "breakdown in communication" [...] with Rhimes, O'Malley's lack of screen time, as well as his decision to be openly gay. Prior to the official announcement of his departure, there was speculation that the role of O'Malley would be recast, but Rhimes labeled it as a [...] "hilarious, ridiculous rumor". After the confirmation of his exit, Knight told TV Guide: [...] "Leaving Grey's Anatomy was not an easy decision for me to make. I am extremely <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> had the opportunity to play this character and will miss my fellow cast and crew very much. I continue to wish them the very best, and wholeheartedly thank all of the fans who have supported me and the show with such passion and enthusiasm." [...] In a statement confirming Knight's departure, Rhimes said: [...] "I think I speak for the entire Grey's Anatomy family when I say we wish T.R. Knight the best in his future endeavors.

500|$|Returning to Australia on the RMS Strathaird, Barr {{joined the}} Royal Australian Air Force as an air cadet on 4March 1940. [...] After {{undergoing}} instruction on Tiger Moths at No.3 Elementary Flying Training School, Essendon, and on Hawker Demons and Avro Ansons at No.1 Service Flying Training School, Point Cook, he was commissioned {{as a pilot}} officer on 24September. He gained a reputation {{as something of a}} rebel during training, and became forever known as [...] "Nicky", for [...] "Old Nick", or the Devil. In his quest to gain assignment as a fighter pilot, he had deliberately aimed poorly during bombing practice, a stratagem also adopted by at least two of his fellow students. [...] By November 1940, he had been posted to No.23 (City of Brisbane) Squadron, flying CAC Wirraways on patrol off the Queensland coast. The aircraft was, according to Barr, [...] "our front line fighter in those days, but it didn't take too long to realise that the capacity of the Wirraway, compared with the types of planes {{that we were going to}} encounter, left much to be desired". Though his duties frustrated him somewhat, Barr was <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> this extensive flight experience under his belt when he eventually saw combat. While based in Queensland, he served as honorary aide-de-camp to the Governor, Sir Leslie Wilson, and also captained the RAAF rugby union team. He was promoted to flying officer on 24March 1941.|$|E

500|$|... "This Is the Day" [...] {{was taken}} from Ivy's second studio album Apartment Life which was {{released}} on October 7, 1997 by Atlantic Records. It was prominently featured in the 1998 American comedy film There's Something About Mary and was also included on the film's official soundtrack. Reflecting on its usage in the film, Durand commented that it was unimaginable to see their songs in several scenes and that she [...] "fe so <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> something like that in a movie". The song was recorded in 1997 in New York City at three different recording studios. Despite Atlantic Records signing Ivy earlier in 1997, they were later dropped and picked up by 550 Music. Following its inclusion on the film, the aforementioned label distributed the song to radio stations across the United States on October 19, 1998, in addition to releasing it as a CD single in the United States; two formats were created, with the commercial release including bonus tracks [...] "Sleeping Late" [...] and [...] "Sweet Mary" [...] and the promotional featuring just the album version of the single. Additionally, 550 Music reissued Apartment Life in the United States with new cover art and digitally remastered tracks, while both Schlesinger and Chase opened up a new recording studio titled Stratosphere in New York City in June 1999.

500|$|In 1979 Glidrose Publications (now Ian Fleming Publications) {{approached}} Gardner {{and asked}} him to revive Ian Fleming's James Bond series of novels. Between 1981 and 1996, Gardner wrote fourteen James Bond novels, and the novelizations of two Bond films. Gardner stated that he wanted [...] "to bring Mr Bond into the 1980s", although he retained the ages of the characters as they were when Fleming had left them. Even though Gardner kept the ages the same, he made Bond grey at the temples as a nod to the passing of the years. With the influence of the American publishers, Putnam's, the Gardner novels showed {{an increase in the number}} of Americanisms used in the book, such as a waiter wearing [...] "pants", rather than trousers, in The Man from Barbarossa. James Harker, writing in The Guardian, considered that the Gardner books were [...] "dogged by silliness", giving examples of Scorpius, where much of the action is set in Chippenham, and Win, Lose or Die, where [...] "Bond gets chummy with an unconvincing Maggie Thatcher". Whilst Gardner's Bond novels received a mixed reaction from the critics, they were popular and a number appeared in The New York Times Best Seller list, bringing the author commercial success. Gardner had an ambivalent view on being the Bond author, once saying that [...] "I'm very <b>grateful</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been selected to keep Bond alive. But I'd much rather be remembered for my own work than I would for Bond", while saying on another occasion that [...] "I remain proud that my contribution to the Bond saga played a great part in its development". In the mid-1990s, after discovering he had esophageal cancer, Gardner officially retired from writing Bond novels and Glidrose Publications quickly chose Raymond Benson to continue the literary stories of James Bond.|$|E
500|$|Later in 2004, McAdams starred {{opposite}} fellow Canadian Ryan Gosling in {{the romantic}} drama The Notebook, based on Nicholas Sparks' {{novel of the}} same name. She played Allie Hamilton, a wealthy southern belle who has a forbidden love affair with Gosling's poor labourer, Noah Calhoun. McAdams spent time in Charleston, South Carolina prior to filming to familiarize herself with the southern accent, and took ballet and etiquette classes. Filming took place from late 2002 to early 2003. Although McAdams and Gosling became romantically involved in 2005, they had a combative relationship on set. [...] "We inspired the worst in each other," [...] Gosling has said. [...] "It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way." [...] At one point, Gosling asked the film's director Nick Cassavetes to [...] "bring somebody else in for my off-camera shot" [...] because he felt McAdams was being uncooperative. Stephen Holden of The New York Times praised the [...] "spontaneous and combustible" [...] performances of the two leads while Roger Ebert of the Chicago Sun-Times was won over by the [...] "beauty and clarity" [...] of McAdams's performance. Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune declared her [...] "a real discovery" [...] who [...] "infuses young Allie with that radiant, breathlessly winning ingénue grace and charm that breaks hearts".

2500|$|Under the Qing dynasty (1644-1911), {{the last}} dynasty of {{imperial}} rule, local government {{became even more}} tightly stretched as population and wealth grew but government administrative institutions – and tax revenue – did not.
