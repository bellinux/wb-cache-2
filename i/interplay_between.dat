In reviews since the record's release by EMI, the album was praised by music critics, who found it exemplary of Kuti's Afrobeat style and recommended it as a highlight from his extensive catalog.

5|$|Innis {{examined}} {{the rise and}} fall of ancient empires as a way of tracing the effects of communications media. He looked at media that led to the growth of an empire; those that sustained it during its periods of success, and then, the communications changes that hastened an empire's collapse. He tried to show that media 'biases' toward time or space affected the complex interrelationships needed to sustain an empire. These interrelationships included the partnership between the knowledge (and ideas) necessary to create and maintain an empire, and the power (or force) required to expand and defend it. For Innis, the <b>interplay</b> <b>between</b> knowledge and power was always a crucial factor in understanding empire.|$|E
5|$|Over the {{instrumental}} passage, the tabla rhythm switches to a 10-beat jhaptal cycle. A musical dialogue ensues in 5/4 time, first between the dilruba and sitar, then between a Western string section and sitar. The <b>interplay</b> <b>between</b> these lead instruments adheres to the call-and-response tradition of Indian classical music, known as jawab-sawal. The passage resolves in melodic unison as the instruments together state a rhythmic cadence, or tihai, {{to close the}} middle segment. After this, the drone is again prominent as the rhythm returns to 16-beat tintal for the final verse and chorus. On the finished recording, the tonal and spiritual tension is relieved by the inclusion of muted canned laughter.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{waste management}} {{and the production of}} space over time in the city of Antwerp, Belgium. By reconstructing how shifting waste practices simultaneously reshape our urban environments at multiple scales, this paper also articulates historic <b>interplays</b> <b>between</b> waste management, urban development and planning practices. Benefiting from available waste processes and materials is a practice that disappeared during industrialisation scale jumps and more linear processes of urbanisation and consumption indeed dominate the current practices. But cities like Antwerp are rethinking these resource consumptive processes and orienting their policies towards what is generally labelled as a resource independent ‘circular economy’. In order to be resilient for climate change, Antwerp’s centralized and heavily engineered and stressed waste collection and treatment installations of the last century require revision, if not systemic redefinition. After a century of dumping on peripheral locations, bottom-up initiatives such as repair cafés, zero waste shops, green schools and even supermarkets are changing the cultural appreciation of ‘waste’ in Antwerp by pulling ‘waste practices’ back into the city and activating social community spaces. What can we learn from the historic <b>interplays</b> <b>between</b> waste and urban development in Antwerp at the eve of Antwerp’s next –circular- waste geography?status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Most {{decisions}} in remanufacturing {{focus on a}} specific sub-system within the production process and neglect how the decision interacts with other decisions. This study aims to investigate decision-making within remanufacturing. The research identifies specific decisions found in remanufacturing processes and analyses their interplays with other decisions. Quite often, one decision will affect other decisions {{and the result is}} that the remanufacturing process becomes more complicated. This is not only because there are many uncertainties in remanufacturing, but also because of the effects of interactions. In particular, this research examines how a company deals with uncertainties in decision-making during the remanufacturing processes. A GRAI grid is used to map the positions of various decisions made throughout the remanufacturing process. This is used as it displays the overall remanufacturing process in a graph, so that <b>interplays</b> <b>between</b> decisions can be seen more clearly. The use of GRAI grid to present <b>interplays</b> <b>between</b> the decisions is remanufacturing is the novelty of this study. It is the first time the grid was utilised in the area of decision making remanufacturing context. The methods utilised by remanufacturing companies to overcome the complexities of decision-making are also discussed. Lastly, directions for future research are presented. </p...|$|R
