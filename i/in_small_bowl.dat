50|$|Wanko Soba (わんこそば) is a {{style of}} Japanese soba noodles {{originating}} from Iwate Prefecture in Japan, particularly Morioka and Hanamaki. It consists of a small serving of soba noodles <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowls.</b> <b>In</b> this soba experience, you quickly eat your soba noodles and get your bowl immediately refilled in repetition.|$|R
50|$|This {{typically}} {{consists of}} many dishes, usually roughly one dish per person. White rice is provided <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowls</b> and food is often consumed over it, flavoring {{it with their}} sauces. The rice is consumed little by little {{along with the other}} dishes and not separately, unless the diner remains hungry after the last dish has been removed.|$|R
50|$|One of Pemalang typical foods is Grombyang rice. The name of {{this food}} is quite unique. It is called Grombyang rice because {{the portion of the}} {{dressing}} is more than the rice and its side dishes so that when it is served <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl</b> it sounds grombyang-grombyang or wobbling like going to spill. When serving, the food consists of rice, slices of buffalo meat and soup which is served with buffalo satay <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl.</b>|$|R
25|$|A {{specially}} constructed pavilion is erected on {{a courtyard}} between the Phaisan Thaksin and Chakkraphat Phiman Halls. Once {{the king is}} seated inside the pavilion, some of the water {{will be given to}} him <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> golden <b>bowl.</b> The king will dip his hand into this water and rub {{the top of his head}} with it. A rope will then be pulled, which releases a shower of water from a canopy above. The king will be offered the water <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowls</b> by members of the Buddhist clergy, the royal family, government ministers, and other officials as an act of blessing.|$|R
50|$|The second {{course is}} 'magic food', which is served <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowls</b> covered with tactile materials. The bowl {{is held in}} the left hand while the right picks out balls made of caramel and filled with {{different}} ingredients such as dried fruits, raw meat, garlic, mashed banana, chocolate, or pepper. The guests cannot guess what flavor they will encounter next.|$|R
50|$|Imitation shark fin soup is a {{noodle soup}} often sold <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowls</b> by street vendors in Hong Kong, {{where it is}} a common street snack. It is a {{substitute}} for shark fin soup, a dish condemned by the Humane Society International, which says tens of millions of sharks are cruelly killed each year for their fins. Imitation shark fin soup is also a more affordable alternative to shark fin soup.|$|R
50|$|A {{change in}} Chinese tea {{drinking}} vessels was evident at this point. Smaller bowls with plain or simple designs {{on the interior}} surfaces were favoured over the larger patterned bowls used for enjoying the patterns created by powdered teas. Tea drinking <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowls</b> and cups was likely adopted since it gathers and directs the fragrant steam from the tea to the nose and allows for better appreciation of the tea's flavour.|$|R
30|$|Slowly dip {{the glass}} slide into {{deionized}} water <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl.</b> If the pioloform film has been properly formed and cut, the film will slide off the glass slide and float {{on the water}} surface.|$|R
50|$|A simple {{presentation}} is the dip served <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl</b> or large ramekin. A bread bowl prepared using hollowed-out bread filled with spinach dip is another method of presentation. Spinach dips are sometimes served hot.|$|R
50|$|Nowadays {{the dish}} is also served in {{riverside}} restaurants, but the dish's historical identity is maintained by it still being served <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl,</b> and {{often with a}} boat moored {{in front of the}} canteen.|$|R
50|$|In 1989 he {{was named}} the head coach and advisor for Team USA. He began instructing long before this though; holding classes <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowling</b> center <b>in</b> Akron Ohio {{eventually}} instructing over 400 bowlers at one time.|$|R
50|$|A similar {{dish that}} {{involves}} tortilla chips and cheese is found <b>in</b> Tex-Mex restaurants. <b>Small</b> <b>bowls</b> of chili con queso and/or, more commonly, salsa, are served with baskets of warm tortilla chips as appetizers.|$|R
25|$|The tea {{mixed with}} tsampa is called Pah. Individual {{portions}} of the mixture are kneaded <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl,</b> formed into balls and eaten. Some cities of the Fukui prefecture in Japan have food similar to tsampa, where concentrated tea is mixed with grain flour. However, the tea {{may or may not}} be made of tea bricks.|$|R
50|$|It {{consists}} of meat (usually thinly sliced beef) which is slowly cooked or simmered at the table, alongside vegetables and other ingredients, {{in a shallow}} iron pot {{in a mixture of}} soy sauce, sugar, and mirin. The ingredients are usually dipped <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl</b> of raw, beaten eggs after being cooked in the pot, and then eaten.|$|R

5000|$|When {{used as an}} {{adjective}} qualifying {{the name}} of a dish, the term [...] "side" [...] usually refers to a smaller portion served as a side dish, rather than a larger, main dish-sized serving. For example, a [...] "side salad" [...] usually served <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl</b> or salad plate, in contrast to a large dinner-plate-sized entrée salad.|$|R
50|$|Soup-like dal and {{vegetables}} cooked in sauce may be served <b>in</b> separate <b>small</b> <b>bowls,</b> {{to be poured}} over the rice. Food is brought to the mouth with the fingers of the right hand. The left hand—traditionally used for certain toilet purposes—should never touch food but may hold cups and glasses. The right hand should be rinsed before and after eating.|$|R

5000|$|Most {{supported}} spindles {{continue to}} rest {{with the tip}} on one's thigh, on the ground, on a table, or <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl</b> while rotating. Supported spindles come in {{a great variety of}} sizes, such as the very large, ~30" [...] Navajo spindle, the small, extremely fast, metal takli for spinning cotton, and the tiniest Orenburg spindles (~20 cm, 15gm) for spinning gossamer lace yarns.|$|R
50|$|Sukiyaki {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular hot pot dishes among the Japanese, and {{undoubtedly}} the most well-known Japanese hot pot overseas, particularly in English-speaking parts of the world. Sukiyaki hot pot is served with sliced beef, vegetables and tofu in a sweet sauce based on soy sauce, which is only used <b>in</b> <b>small</b> amounts, enough for the ingredients to merge in a shallow iron pot. Before being eaten, the ingredients are usually dipped <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl</b> of raw, beaten eggs.|$|R
40|$|For {{those who}} {{constantly}} have supported me, or at least, never doubted on my perseverance. To Professor Corazza and Mr. Donati, firm guides and precious companions in this financial travel. To my family, to my friends, to Siusi. To Kenji. May all his dreams come true! “If goldfish are kept <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl,</b> {{they will remain}} small. With more space, the fish can double, triple, or quadruple its size. ...|$|R
40|$|Arrival {{at school}} and feet-washing". Photograph of three school boys washing their feet on arrival at school. They are washing their feet <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowls</b> placed on the ground. In the {{background}} there is a low thatched hut with two bicycles visible inside.; This belongs {{to a series of}} Church of Scotland Foreign Missions Committee lantern slides relating to Lubwa mission. Lubwa mission at Chinsali in north-eastern Zambia began as an outpost of the Free Church of Scotland mission in Malawi. The first missionary expeditions to the Chinsali area were carried out by student teachers from the Overtoun Institute at Khondowe. The Bemba are the largest ethnic group in northern Zambia and the first Free Church of Scotland establishment among the Bemba was a school at Lubwa, opened in 1905 by the Malawian teacher David Kaunda and his wife...|$|R
5000|$|Goldfish and bettas, in particular, {{have often}} been kept <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowls</b> or aquaria that are too small for their needs. In some cases, fish have been {{installed}} {{in all sorts of}} inappropriate objects such as the [...] "AquaBabies Micro Aquaria", [...] "Bubble Gear Bubble Bag", and [...] "Betta in a Vase", all of which house live fish in unfiltered and insufficient water. The latter is sometimes marketed as a complete ecosystem because a plant is included in the neck of the vase. Some sellers claim the fish eat the plant roots. However, bettas are carnivorous and need live food or pellet foods. They cannot survive on plant roots. Another problem is that the plant sometimes blocks the betta's passage to the water surface. They are labyrinth fish and need to breathe at the surface to avoid suffocation.|$|R
50|$|The {{standard}} Japanese breakfast {{consists of}} steamed white rice, {{a bowl of}} miso soup, and Japanese styled pickles (like takuan or umeboshi). A raw egg and nori are often served; the raw egg is beaten <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl</b> and poured on the hot rice to make golden colored tamago kake gohan, whilst the nori (sheets of dried seaweed) is used to wrap rice. Grilled fish and Japanese green tea are often served as well.|$|R
50|$|While {{the origins}} of ice cream are often debated, most {{scholars}} trace the first ice cream parlor back to France in the 17th century. In 1686, Francesco Procopio del Coltelli opened Paris' first café. The Café Procope, named by its Sicilian founder, introduced gelato to the French public. The dessert was served to its elite guests <b>in</b> <b>small</b> porcelain <b>bowls.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Tigers {{would not}} finish higher than 3rd in the Southeastern Conference until 1982, which {{resulted}} <b>in</b> them gaining <b>smaller</b> <b>bowl</b> invites during that time. LSU stumbled to 5-5-1 in 1974 and 4-7 in 1975, its only non-winning seasons during Charles McClendon's 18-year tenure in Baton Rouge (1962-79).|$|R
50|$|Medama-oyaji is Kitarō's father. Once a {{fully formed}} adult ghost, he perished of a disease, {{only to be}} reborn out of his decayed body as an {{anthropomorphic}} version of his own eyeball. He looks small and fragile, but has a strong spirit and a great love for his son. He is also extremely knowledgeable about ghosts and monsters. He enjoys staying clean, and is often seen bathing <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl.</b> He has a great love for sake.|$|R
40|$|Larval summer {{flounder}} Paralichthys dentatus were hatched and reared through metamorphosis in the laboratory. At several {{points in the}} rearing cycle, larvae were removed from their rearing chambers and placed <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowls,</b> where they were fed known quantities of the rotifer Brachionus plicatilis (flounder larvae age 6, 10, or 13 d posthatch) or nauplii of brine shrimp Artemia sp. (flounder larvae age 23, 28, 34, or 47 d posthatch). Counts of prey organisms remaining in the bowls after 24 h allowed us to calculate numbers of prey consumed. Consumption rates increased from 62 rotifers/ 24 h (6 -d larvae) to 301 rotifers/ 24 h (13 -d larvae) and from 59 brine shrimp/ 24 h (23 -d larvae) to 394 brine shrimp/ 24 h (47 -d larvae). These rates {{can be used to}} calculate the approximate rotifer and brine shrimp production necessary for rearing {{summer flounder}} through metamorphosis in aquaculture hatcheries...|$|R
50|$|Mämmi is {{traditionally}} made of water, rye flour, and powdered malted rye, seasoned salt, and dried powdered Seville orange zest. The mixture is then {{allowed to go}} through a slow natural sweetening process before being baked in an oven until set with Maillard reaction. Preparation takes many hours, and after baking the mämmi is stored chilled for three to four days before being ready to eat. Instead of being allowed to sweeten naturally, traditionally, commercially made mämmi is usually seasoned with dark molasses. Traditional mämmi tastes aromatic sweet, having only up to 2% sugar, but commercially produced mämmi can have as much as 20% sugar and tastes different, not so aromatic sweet. Mämmi has up to 10% protein and is rich in trace elements. Mämmi was traditionally stored <b>in</b> <b>small</b> <b>bowls</b> made of birch bark called tuokkonen or rove. Finnish packaging still prints birch bark-like texture on the carton boxes.|$|R
5000|$|Boat noodles or kuaitiao ruea (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวเรือ, [...] ) is a Thai style noodle dish, {{which has}} a strong flavor. It {{contains}} both pork and beef, as well as dark soy sauce, pickled bean curd and some other spices, and is normally served with meatballs and pig’s liver. The soup also contains nam tok (น้ำตก), which is cow or pigs blood mixed with salt, to season the soup. The color of the soup is similar to beef noodles soup (ก๋วยเตี๋ยวเนื้อ). It is commonly served <b>in</b> a <b>small</b> <b>bowl.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Some five-pin centres have {{installed}} lane protection devices. The device is {{a sheet of}} plexiglas mounted vertically about six inches (15 cm) above the lane and is located just past the target arrows on the lane. This device discourages bowlers from lofting the ball and damaging the lane—which is more prevalent <b>in</b> <b>small</b> ball <b>bowling.</b> A ball that knocks the plexiglas loose or flies over the plexiglas guard is worth zero points under C5PBA rules.|$|R
5000|$|Procopio soon added {{coffee to}} his refreshments' list and the kiosk became a cafe. Procopio {{introduced}} the Italian [...] "ice cream" [...] gelato at his cafe {{and is one}} of the first to sell this new European product directly to the public. Prior to then it was reserved for royalty only. Procopio's café served it <b>in</b> <b>small</b> porcelain <b>bowls</b> that resembled egg cups. He is sometimes referred to as [...] "The Father of Italian gelato".|$|R
