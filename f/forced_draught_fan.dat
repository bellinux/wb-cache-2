50|$|Water {{circulation}} {{within the}} boiler furnace was assisted by fully immersed electrical pumps manufactured by Hayward Tyler Co. The pulverised fuel plant was built and installed by International Combustion Ltd. Four Lopulco coal roller mills with pulverised coal fans per boiler {{were located in}} the boiler house basement. Coal was fed from overhead bunkers by speed-regulated drum feeders to the mills and crushed to fine dust by three 7.5 ton roller doors per mill, then blown into the wind boxes through pipework and the PF nozzles. Combustion air was delivered by two <b>forced</b> <b>draught</b> <b>fans</b> located above the coal bunkers, taking warm air from above the boiler roof casing and discharging it though rotating heat exchangers to the furnace wind boxes. Hot gas was drawn from the furnaces through the pendants, water tube economisers, rotating heat exchanger, cyclone dust collectors and electrostatic precipitators by two induced <b>draught</b> <b>fans</b> before entering the chimney flue ducts and passing up the 500 ft high chimneys.|$|R

50|$|Each {{unit had}} two large <b>Forced</b> <b>Draught</b> (FD) <b>Fans.</b> For {{efficiency}} these fans drew warm air from an intake {{at the top}} of the station. This combustion air was passed through the Air Heater which increased its temperature. Dampers were used to control the quantity of air admitted to the furnace and direct some of the air to the Primary Air (PA) Fans.There were also two large Induced Air (ID) Fans on each unit. These drew the hot gases from the Boiler, through the Air Heater where the heat is transferred to the incoming combustion air. The gases were then exhausted up the chimney. The exhaust flow of these fans was also controlled by dampers in the ducting.Working in tandem the Draught plant ensured the boiler was always under a slight vacuum. This created a draw of combustion air into the boiler and an exhaust to the chimney. The exhaust gases could not be allowed to cool below a certain temperature, as there was a risk of the sulfur and nitrogen oxides in the flue gases condensing and forming acids which could have damaged the ID Fans.|$|R
50|$|The four 500 MW boilers at Cottam Power Station are {{manufactured}} by John Thompson Water Tube Boilers Limited, {{in conjunction with}} Clarke Chapman & Co. Ltd. Each has an evaporation rate at M.C.R. of 1.542 tonne/hour (3,400 lb/hr). The boiler plant has been designed for short time overload operation. By by-passing two of the H.P. feed heaters and increasing the firing rate by 8% an increase of 5% electrical output can be obtained. Coal is fed from the bunker to the fuel pulverising mills by variable speed drag-link feeders. The four barrel type mills rotated at 15 rev/min (94.25 Rad/min), and are swept by hot air which carries the P.F. mixture to eight classifiers that reject any unground pieces of coal back to the mill. Eight exhausters pass the P.F. to 32 turbulent P.F. burners arranged in four rows of eight burners on the boiler front. Each P.F. burner has an integral oil burner which is used for lighting up purposes and low load operation when instability with P.F. firing would be experienced. Combustion air is fed to the burners by two <b>forced</b> <b>draught</b> <b>fans</b> which pass warm air ducted {{from the top of}} the boiler house through two rotary regenerative air heaters to the secondary, or combustion air registers around each burner. The air heaters are so designed that they can be by-passed on the gas and air side to facilitate optimum operating conditions. The boiler feed water which is passed through the economiser before entering the drum is circulated around the combustion chamber water wall tubes by any three of the four boiler water circulating pumps. Steam from the drum is passed to the H.P. turbine through a horizontal primary super heater bank, pendant super heater platens, and pendant final super heater bank. The super heater platens which are situated directly above the combustion chamber differ from other heaters in that the heat is imparted to the steam by radiation as well as convection. The other heaters being later in the gas duct rely mainly on convection for heat transfer. Steam temperature control is achieved by two stages of attemperation, one of which s between the primary super heater and the super heater platens and the other, which controls the final steam temperature, is immediately before the final super heater inlet. Exhaust steam from the H.P. turbine is returned to the boiler for re-heating at a constant pressure before being returned to the I.P. turbine. This achieved by a horizontal primary and a pendant final re-heater situated in the gas duct. Steam temperature control is achieved by non-contact type attemperators. The boiler is kept clean by 42 gun type soot blowers in the combustion chamber and 42 long retractable blowers which clean the pendant and convection surfaces, all operating under automatic control from the control room. The hot gasses from the combustion chamber are drawn through the super heater and re-heater banks, air heater and precipitators by induced <b>draught</b> <b>fans</b> which expel the gasses through the F.G.D. to the chimney. The fans maintain a slight vacuum within the combustion chamber in order to prevent combustion gasses leaking into the boiler house. The precipitators which are entirely of steel construction collect the dust by electrostatic means and there are no mechanical collectors.|$|R

40|$|Limited water {{supplies}} in arid regions that have abundant solar resources eliminates {{the use of}} water as a feasible means of cooling condensers in a Concentrated Solar Power (CSP) plant condenser. This has triggered the need to optimise existing air-cooled condenser technology, which is currently extremely inefficient. This paper aims to investigate the influence of various fan parameters {{on the performance of}} a cross-flow heat exchanger. The study first focuses on the effect of varying the distance between the fan and the heat exchanger in order to establish if uniform airflow distributions can be achieved with acceptable axial spacing between the fan and the heat exchanger. This was achieved by mapping the velocity field at the outlet from the heat exchanger by means of a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) analysis. The analysis was carried out for two air flow scenarios; the fan mounted at the inlet to the heat exchanger (<b>forced</b> <b>draught)</b> and the <b>fan</b> mounted at the outlet of the heat exchanger (induced draught). An investigation into the effect of fan speed on velocity distribution was also carried out. The measurements which are presented show that uniform velocity distributions can be achieved with relatively small fan to heat exchanger spacing for the case of the induced draught, whilst for the forced draft, although increasing the fan to heat exchanger spacing resulted in increased flow uniformity, the flow was still highly non uniform at fan to heat exchanger spacing of up to 1. 4 times the fan tip radius. The measurements also showed little effect of fan speed on normalised velocity distribution. Combining the fore mentioned measurements with an analytical calculation technique, the heat flux per unit area across the heat exchanger was calculated. The results highlight the limitations on heat transfer in various regions of the heat exchanger in both flow scenarios. These measurements and calculations will facilitate designers of air cooled heat exchangers in achieving the minimum fan to heat exchanger spacing which gives no further increase in total heat transfer.
