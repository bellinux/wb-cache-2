Each lift was staffed, and at some quiet stations in the 1920s the ticket office was moved into the lift, or it was arranged that the lift could be controlled from the ticket office. The first escalator on the London Underground was installed in 1911 between the District and Piccadilly platforms at Earl's Court and from the following year new deep-level stations were provided with escalators instead of lifts.

40|$|Acne is {{the result}} of {{excessive}} grease on the skin. The successful treatment of acne depends essentially on the <b>degreasing</b> of the skin to an extent which produces peeling, which is the observable index of adequate treatment.

40|$|International audienceIn {{the metal}} {{finishing}} or aeronautical industries, efficient <b>degreasing</b> of metallic alloy surfaces {{is an essential}} step. This step was first performed with halogenated solvents. Legislation has involved since 1999 their replacement with green cleaners due to the hazardous effects of solvents on human health and on environment. Aqueous cleaners, commonly called detergents, are widely used as an alternative. The monitoring of such <b>degreasing</b> baths is usually realized by alkaline titration or conductimetry. However these techniques do not provide significant information {{on the state of}} <b>degreasing</b> baths. In this study a new method is proposed using dynamic light scattering (DLS). This technique can evaluate the size of the micelles formed in the <b>degreasing</b> bath. The free and "full of oil" micelles can be identified and quantified due to their different sizes. The contamination rate and the loss of detergent all along the use of the bath can be determined with these new indicators. After a validation step with prepared <b>degreasing</b> solutions, this method has allowed monitoring precisely industrial <b>degreasing</b> baths, reducing the frequency of the baths replacement, the volume of aqueous effluents and optimizing baths management...|$|R

No data is available about the potential biological health hazards in such system. Thus, a health risk assessment linked to the bacterial populations present in this new <b>degreasing</b> technology is, therefore, necessary for workers. We performed both cultural and molecular approaches in several biological <b>degreasing</b> systems for various industrial contexts to investigate the composition and dynamics of bacterial populations. These biological <b>degreasing</b> systems did not work with the original bacterial populations. Indeed, they were colonized by a defined and restricted group of bacteria. This group replaced the indigenous bacterial populations known for degrading complex substrates. Klebsiella pneumoniae, Klebsiella oxytoca, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Pantoea agglomerans were important members of the microflora found {{in most of the}} biological <b>degreasing</b> systems.

50|$|Production {{was split}} between the Alfa Romeo plant in Arese and Carrozzeria Bertone's plants in Caselle and Grugliasco outside Turin.

5000|$|Many {{different}} foods can be <b>degreased</b> after preparation. Liquid {{foods that}} are high in fat, such as braising liquids, roasting juices and broths may have floating oil on top throughout and after the cooking process. Fat can be skimmed off the liquid with a small ladle, spoon, or cup as the liquid simmers and then discarded. This is done by placing the saucepan with only half {{of it on the}} heat source so that the liquid simmers only on one side. This pushes the fat to the opposite side and makes it easier to lift off with the ladle. The fat can then be skimmed off by holding the ladle so that the top of its bowl is almost level with the liquid and then tilting it slightly and in a circular motion {{toward the edge of the}} saucepan where the fat accumulates.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. This {{research}} {{deals with}} the corrosion stability of components with a galvanized surface. The aim is to determine how corrosion resistance is influenced by chemical <b>degreasing.</b> The ZiNi galvanizing method in a bath line was performed on 10 components; another 10 pieces were treated by the same galvanizing method, but without previous chemical <b>degreasing.</b> After measuring the thickness of coating, components were inserted into a salt spray corrosion chamber. The test showed that components with a complete galvanizing process revealed no signs of red corrosion after 456 test hours. In components without chemical <b>degreasing,</b> {{there were signs of}} red corrosion after 200 test hours. After this research, we can conclude that chemical <b>degreasing</b> in galvanizing processes has a high influence on corrosion resistance...|$|R

5000|$|Coating: Coating is {{the process}} step in which a layer is applied on the cavity surface of the optical insert which protects the mould against wear, corrosion, friction, {{sticking}} of glass and chemical reactions with glass. For coating the surface of moulds by physical vapour deposition (PVD), metals are evaporated in combination with process-gas-based chemicals. On the tool surface, highly adherent thin coatings are synthesized. Materials for coatings on optical inserts are Platinum-based PVD (mostly iridium-alloyed, standard), diamond-like carbon (not yet commercially available), SiC (CVD) on SiC-ceramics (not yet commercially available, have to be post-machined) or TiAlN (not yet commercially available). To achieve a homogeneous layer thickness, the mould's position has to be changed during coating. To prepare the mould for the coating the surfaces have to be <b>degreased,</b> cleaned (under clean room or near-clean room conditions) and batched. Especially the cathode of the machine has to be cleaned. After this process the workpiece has to be debatched.|$|E
50|$|Roll bonding {{is a solid}} state, {{cold welding}} process, {{obtained}} through flat rolling of sheet metals. In roll bonding, two or more layers of different metals are passed through a pair of flat rollers under sufficient pressure to bond the layers. The pressure is high enough to deform the metals and reduce the combined thickness of the clad material. The mating surfaces must be previously prepared (scratched, cleaned, <b>degreased)</b> {{in order to increase}} their friction coefficient and remove any oxide layers.The process can be performed at room temperature or at warm conditions. In warm roll bonding, heat is applied to pre-heat the sheets just before rolling, in order to increase their ductility and improve the strength of the weld. The strength of the rolled bonds depends on the main process parameters, including the rolling conditions (entry temperature of the sheets, amount of thickness reduction, rolling speed, etc.), the pre-rolling treatment conditions (annealing temperature and time, surface preparation techniques, etc.) and the post-rolling heat treatments.|$|E

40|$|<b>Degreasing</b> is {{a process}} for {{cleaning}} products from water-insoluble substances as grease, fats, oils, waxes, carbon deposits, fluxes and tars. In most cases the process is applied to metal products, but also plastic, fibreglass, printed circuit boards and other products are treated by the same process. Therefore {{a wide range of}} NACE codes is covered. The metal-working industries are the major users of solvent <b>degreasing.</b> Solvent <b>degreasing</b> is also used in industries as printing and production of chemicals, plastics, rubber, textiles, glass, paper, and electric power. Also repair stations for transportation vehicles use solvent cleaning part of the time. 2 CONTRIBUTION TO TOTAL EMISSIONS. From the CORINAIR 90 inventory it can be concluded that the contribution of metal <b>degreasing</b> to total non-methane volatile organic compound emissions (including natural sources) for 21 of the 28 CORINAIR countries is about 1. 8 %. The OSPARCOM-HELCOM-UNECE emission inventory gives for some specified substances the contributions given in Table 2. 1. These substances are: • tetrachloroethene (PER), • trichloroethene (TRI), • 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (TCA), • tetrachloromethane (TCM) and xylenes (XYL).
