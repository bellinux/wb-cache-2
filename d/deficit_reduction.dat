5|$|Spending {{and loan}} {{guarantees}} from the Federal Reserve and the Treasury Department {{authorized by the}} Bush and Obama administrations totaled about $11.5trillion, but only $3trillion was spent {{by the end of}} November 2009. Obama and the Congressional Budget Office predicted the 2010 budget deficit would be $1.5trillion or 10.6% of the nation's gross domestic product (GDP) compared to the 2009 deficit of $1.4trillion or 9.9% of GDP. For 2011, the administration predicted the deficit will shrink to $1.34trillion, and the 10-year deficit will increase to $8.53trillion or 90% of GDP. The most recent increase in the U.S. debt ceiling to $17.2trillion took effect in February 2014. On August 2, 2011, after a lengthy congressional debate over whether to raise the nation's debt limit, Obama signed the bipartisan Budget Control Act of 2011. The legislation enforces limits on discretionary spending until 2021, establishes a procedure to increase the debt limit, creates a Congressional Joint Select Committee on <b>Deficit</b> <b>Reduction</b> to propose further <b>deficit</b> <b>reduction</b> with a stated goal of achieving at least $1.5trillion in budgetary savings over 10 years, and establishes automatic procedures for reducing spending by as much as $1.2trillion if legislation originating with the new joint select committee does not achieve such savings. By passing the legislation, Congress was able to prevent a U.S. government default on its obligations.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} the long-run causal relationship between government revenues and spending of the Swedish economy {{over the period}} 1722 – 2011. The results based on hidden cointegration technique and {{a modified version of}} the Granger non-causality test, show that there exists a long-run and asymmetric relationship between government spending and government revenues. Our estimation results can be summarized into three main empirical findings. First, the government follows a hard budget constraint and soft budget constraint strategies in the case of negative and positive shocks, respectively. Second, negative shocks to the fiscal budget are removed fairly quickly compared to positive shocks. Third, bi-directional causality between revenues and expenditures offers support in favor of the fiscal synchronization hypothesis. The policy implication is that budget <b>deficit’s</b> <b>reduction</b> could be achieved through government spending cut, accompanied by contemporaneous tax controls...|$|R

In particular; we show {{the conditions under which}} budget deficits must be reduced in the short run below the level of maximum sustainable deficits in the long-run deregulated equilibrium. Finally, we show that the deregulation of financial markets may not uniformly improve welfare. This focus on the interaction between structural reforms and fiscal policies distinguishes our work from the literature on stabilization programs. Our study of interactions between stabilization and structural policies is equally important for both developed and developing countries. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- This paper {{examines}} the causal relationship between inflation and fiscal deficits in Nigeria, covering the period 1970 - 2009. This {{was carried out}} by way of developing an estimation model of inflation and fiscal deficit, with a view to testing causes and effects as well as the relationship between them. The estimation technique used is the autoregressive distributed lag (ARDL) model and the Granger-causality test. The result of the Granger-causality test shows that the null hypothesis which says that fiscal deficit does not cause inflation should be rejected since the result is significant with probability less than 0. 05. This implies that fiscal deficit/GDP causes inflation. However, no feedback mechanism was observed. The results from the ARDL test confirm a significant negative relationship between growth in fiscal deficit (% of GDP) and inflation. The above results confirm the a priori expectation. It is recommended that policies targeted at inflationary control in Nigeria could best be achieved if they are aimed at fiscal <b>deficits</b> <b>reduction.</b> In addition, the government should support growth in the real sectors of the economy...|$|R

We examine the consequences of reducing the target deficit ratio to 1 % and of refundable fines for those who exceed the 3 % limit, specified in the Maastricht Treaty. We also consider the possibility of targeting structural, rather than actual, deficits. We find tax increases are necessary, {{and would have to}} be permanent, if the proposed <b>deficit</b> <b>reductions</b> are to be sustained below the 3 % limit. We also find that changes in the policy mix are necessary – a loosening in the real value of money relative to fiscal policy (but not necessarily in absolute terms) – to avoid liquidity shortages or a debt explosion. Finally, and by far the most important result, is a sharp rise in real interest rates. In the longer term, this destroys investment, employment and output capacity. That is a more serious cost than short-term losses in output itself. capacity output; Fiscal-monetary interactions; Monetary Union...|$|R

The water <b>deficit</b> caused <b>reduction</b> in leaf relative water content and increase in levels of hydrogen peroxide, and it also provoked decrease in all photosynthetic pigments, being the changes more intense and significant after 18 days.
