5|$|This type {{of policy}} {{is common in}} Dolichovespula norwegica wasps where despite being more related to other workers’ sons, worker-laid <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> {{consumed}} by other workers.|$|E
5|$|Péron {{stated that}} the nest was usually {{situated}} near water {{and on the ground}} under the shade of a bush. It was constructed of sticks and lined with dead leaves and moss; it was oval in shape and not very deep. He claimed that seven to nine <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> laid always on 25 and 26 July, but the selective advantage of this breeding synchronisation is unknown. The female incubated the eggs, but the male apparently developed a brood patch, which indicates it contributed as well. The non-incubating parent also stayed by the nest, and the chicks left the nest two to three days after hatching. The <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> preyed upon by snakes, rats, and quolls. Péron gave the incubation period as five or six weeks, but since the mainland emu incubates for 50 to 56 days, this may be too short. He stated a mother emu would defend its young from crows with its beak, but this is now known to be strictly male behaviour.|$|E
5|$|The <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> first {{named in}} 1994, {{when the two}} oospecies were {{classified}} in distinct oogenera as Cairanoolithus dughii and Dughioolithus roussetensis. They are now considered to belong in a single oogenus, possibly even a single oospecies. Though it has been classified as a megaloolithid, Cairanoolithus is now placed in its own oofamily, Cairanoolithidae.|$|E
50|$|The Sapphire Pendant <b>Egg</b> <b>was</b> sent to Tsar Alexander III on April 5, 1886 from Fabergé's workshop. The <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> {{presented}} by the Tsar to Tsarina Marie Fedorovna on April 13 of the same year. The <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> housed in the Anichkov Palace until the Revolution. The last documented location of the <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> from the archive of the provisional government's inventory in 1922 when the <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> held in the Armory Palace of the Kremlin. It is not known whether the <b>egg</b> <b>was</b> lost or is currently in private hands.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{deposited}} in heaps of coconut leaves or in silt over stony substratum. <b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> soft-shelled, measuring 6.4 × 15.9 mm, and two <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> produced {{at a time}} around March.|$|R
50|$|<b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> usually first {{scrambled}} in a bowl, {{and tomatoes}} are sliced into wedges. Tomatoes are fried first {{for about a}} minute, salt <b>is</b> added then <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> added last. Cook until <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> done.|$|R
5|$|Young {{birds were}} often {{captured}} {{and kept in}} menageries both in India and in Europe in former times. They were also successfully bred in captivity early in the 17th century by Emperor Jehangir who {{also noted that the}} <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> laid with an interval of two days and that incubation period was 34 days. They were also bred in zoos in Europe and the United States in the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|Aylesbury ducks, meanwhile, were {{becoming}} inbred, meaning fertile <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> scarcer and the ducks were {{more susceptible to}} disease. Exhibition standards had led to selection for an exaggerated keel by breeders, despite it being unpopular with dealers and consumers. Poultry show judges also admired the long neck and upright posture of Pekin ducks over the boat-like stance of the Aylesbury. Some of the breeders in the Aylesbury area began to cross Pekin ducks with the pure Aylesbury strain. Although the Aylesbury-Pekin cross ducks {{did not have the}} delicate flavour of the pure Aylesbury, they were hardier and much cheaper to raise.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of the troodonts Mei and Sinornithoides {{demonstrate}} that some dinosaurs slept {{with their heads}} tucked under their arms. This behavior, which may have helped to keep the head warm, is also characteristic of modern birds. Several deinonychosaur and oviraptorosaur specimens have also been found preserved {{on top of their}} nests, likely brooding in a bird-like manner. The ratio between egg volume and body mass of adults among these dinosaurs suggest that the <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> primarily brooded by the male, and that the young were highly precocial, similar to many modern ground-dwelling birds.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{often used}} in Czech cuisine because many {{families}} outside of cities breed hens. Scrambled <b>eggs</b> (...) <b>are</b> common. Fried <b>eggs</b> ( [...] , literally [...] "bulls eye") are often served with bread or potatoes and spinach. Boiled <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> also popular. Stuffed <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> made from halved, shelled, hard-boiled <b>eggs.</b> The yolk <b>is</b> carefully removed into a separate bowl, mixed with salt, mustard and spices and stuffed back. It can be decorated.|$|R
50|$|In Croatia, both {{coloured}} {{eggs and}} uncoloured Easter <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> used as everyone picks an egg to tap or have tapped; every <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> used {{until the last}} person with the unbroken <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> declared the winner, sometimes winning a money pool.|$|R
50|$|A {{clutch can}} {{comprise}} {{up to six}} eggs, though usually four or five are laid, with four being the commonest number. <b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> quite variable and cannot be reliably identified as to which Australian corvid laid them, however the colouration of the two crow species <b>eggs</b> <b>is</b> different to the three ravens. Ravens' <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> a light turquoise with brown blotches, but crows' <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> a dirty white with brown speckles.|$|R
5|$|Historically, {{people could}} {{do little to}} protect their crops from being devastated by locusts, {{although}} eating the insects {{may have been some}} consolation. By the early 20th century, efforts were being made to disrupt the development of the insects by cultivating the soil where <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> laid, collecting hoppers with catching machines, killing them with flamethrowers, trapping them in ditches, and crushing them with rollers and other mechanical methods. By the 1950s, the organochloride dieldrin was found to be an extremely effective insecticide, but it was later banned from use in most countries because of its persistence in the environment and its bioaccumulation in the food chain.|$|E
5|$|In 1976, {{a clutch}} of seven 190-million-year-old Massospondylus eggs was found in Golden Gate Highlands National Park in South Africa by James Kitching, who {{identified}} them as most likely belonging to Massospondylus. It was nearly 30 years before extraction was started on the fossils of the 15-centimetre- (6in-) long embryos. They remain the oldest dinosaur embryos ever found. By early 2012, at least 10 egg clutches from at least four fossiliferous horizons had been found, with up to 34 eggs per clutch. This indicates that this nesting site {{may have been used}} repeatedly (site fidelity), by groups of animals (colonial nesting); in both cases, these represent the oldest evidence of this behaviour. Sedimentary structures indicate that the nesting area was in the vicinity of a lake. The eggshells were very thin (about 0.1 mm), allowing gas exchange even in a low oxygen and carbon dioxide rich environment, which indicates that the <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> at least partly buried in the substrate. There are no hints that Massospondylus constructed nests; however, the arrangement of the eggs in tight rows indicates that the <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> pushed in this position by the adults.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, eggs {{possibly}} {{attributable to}} M. yaotunensis were discovered paired inside the pelvis of a fossil oviraptorid skeleton. In 2008, Chinese paleontologists Cheng Yen-nien, Ji Qiang, Wu Xiao-chun and Shan Hsi-yin discovered {{a pair of}} eggs representing the first in China to contain embryonic remains of oviraptorosaurs. Both <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> referred to M. yaotunensis. The fourth oospecies, M. lashuyuanensis, was described in 2009 by the Chinese paleontologists Fang Xiao-si, Li Pei-xian, Zhang Zhi-jun, Zhang Xian-qiu, Lin You-li, Guo Sheng-bin, Cheng Ye-ming, Li Zhen-yu, Zhang Xiao-jun and Cheng Zheng-wu.|$|E

50|$|Deviled <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> {{a common}} dish in the United States. In the Midwestern and Southern U.S., they are {{commonly}} served as hors d'oeuvres before a full meal is served, often during the Christmas season. Deviled <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> so {{popular in the}} United States that special trays are sold specifically for serving them. Prepared and packaged deviled <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> now available in some U.S. supermarkets. While deviled <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> sometimes sprinkled with Old Bay seasoning on the east coast, paprika is more commonly used in the south. Deviled <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> commonly served at Derby parties in Kentucky.|$|R
50|$|Tamago kake gohan, popularly {{abbreviated}} TKG, is a dish {{in which}} a raw <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> put on top of or mixed with rice, or a recipe for such a dish. Beaten <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> sometimes used, as are non-beaten. Sometimes only the yolk of the <b>egg</b> <b>is</b> used.|$|R
5|$|Multiple {{different}} genera of oviraptorids {{have been}} found on or near elongatoolithid nests indicating that oviraptorid parents would brood on their eggs, most likely for extended periods of time. There is some {{evidence to suggest that}} oviraptorid and troodontid <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> cared for by the father, perhaps in a polygamous system. Given the large size of eggs relative to the parent, a mother would only lay two eggs at a time, so the eggs of a single nest may have been contributed by multiple females.|$|E
5|$|Prickly pear cacti were {{introduced}} into Queensland, Australia as ornamental plants, starting in 1788. They quickly spread to cover over 25 million hectares of Australia by 1920, increasing by 1 million hectares per year. Digging, burning and crushing all proved ineffective. Two control agents {{were introduced}} to help control {{the spread of the}} plant, the cactus moth Cactoblastis cactorum, and the scale insect Dactylopius. Between 1926 and 1931, tens of millions of cactus moth <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> distributed around Queensland with great success, and by 1932, most areas of prickly pear had been destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Several egg {{clutches}} of C. dughii are known, containing {{as many as}} 25 fossilized eggs. Unfortunately, taphonomical alterations (changes during the fossilization process) {{make it difficult to}} determine the original structure of the nest. Cousin (2002) hypothesized that Cairanoolithus <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> laid {{on the surface of the}} ground, possibly buried beneath a mound of plant matter. Tanaka et al. (2015) noted that the shell had a high rate of water vapor conductance. Therefore, they concluded that Cairanoolithus nests were covered by organic or inorganic material, similar to modern eggs with high vapor conductance.|$|E

5|$|Some {{specimens}} of M. yaotunensis preserve {{traces of the}} reddish brown pigment protoporphyrin and the blue-green pigment biliverdin, the same pigments used in the eggs of many modern birds. The <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> most likely an intense blue-green color, {{as shown by the}} predominance of biliverdin in the shell. The purpose of the coloration is uncertain, but in modern birds it can serve as coloration or as a post-mating sexual signal. Colored eggs are also correlated with active paternal care in modern birds, lending further support to the hypothesis that oviraptorid males cared for their eggs.|$|E
5|$|Temnospondyls, {{like all}} amphibians, {{reproduced}} in aquatic environments. Most temnospondyls probably reproduced through external fertilization. Like most living frogs, female temnospondyls would have laid masses of eggs in water while males released sperm to fertilize them. Several fossils were described from the Early Permian of Texas in 1998 {{that may be}} egg masses of dissorophoid temnospondyls. They were the first known fossils of amphibian eggs. The fossils consist of small disks with thin membranes that are probably vitelline membranes and halo-like areas surrounding them that are most likely mucous coatings. They are attached to plant fossils, suggesting that these temnospondyls laid eggs on aquatic plants much like modern frogs. The mucous membranes show that the <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> laid by amphibians, not fish (their eggs lack mucous), but the type of amphibian that laid them cannot be known because no body fossils are preserved with the eggs. The eggs {{are thought to be}} from dissorophoids because {{they are likely to be}} close relatives of modern amphibians, and probably had similar reproductive strategies. They are also the most common amphibians from the deposit in which the <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> found.|$|E
5|$|The oldest dinosaur embryos ever {{discovered}} {{were found}} in the park in 1978. The <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> from the Triassic Period (220 to 195 million years ago) and had fossilised foetal skeletons of Massospondylus, a prosauropod dinosaur. More examples of these eggs have since been found in the park. Other fossils found in the park include those of advanced cynodontia (canine toothed animals), small thecodontia (animals with teeth set firmly in the jaw), bird-like and crocodile-like dinosaurs.|$|E
50|$|In Britain {{copulation}} {{takes place}} {{during the period from}} spring to autumn. During copulation both slugs cling together so closely that no everted genitalia are visible. Under laboratory conditions, the first <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> laid 5-15 days after copulation. At one time approximately 15 <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> laid. This can be repeated several times, but in total not more than 100 <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> laid by one individual. The dimensions of the <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> 2 × 1.5 mm. Self-fertilization is also possible.|$|R
5000|$|Steaming: <b>Eggs</b> <b>are</b> taken {{straight}} from the refrigerator {{and placed in the}} steamer at full steam. The eggs will not crack due to sudden change in temperatures. At full steam, [...] "soft-boiled" [...] <b>eggs</b> <b>are</b> ready in 6 minutes, [...] "hard-boiled" [...] eggs at 8 minutes.

5|$|This {{species is}} {{estimated}} {{to have had a}} maximum population in the millions. The great auk was hunted on a significant scale for food, eggs, and its down feathers from at least the eighth century. Prior to that, hunting by local natives may be documented from Late Stone Age Scandinavia and eastern North America, as well as from early fifth century Labrador, where the bird seems to have occurred only as stragglers. Early explorers, including Jacques Cartier, and numerous ships attempting to find gold on Baffin Island were not provisioned with food for the journey home, and therefore, used this vulnerable species as both a convenient food source and bait for fishing. Reportedly, some of the later vessels anchored next to a colony and ran out planks to the land. The sailors then herded hundreds of these great auks onto the ships, where they were slaughtered. Some authors have questioned the reports of this hunting method and whether it was successful. Great auk <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> also a valued food source, as the <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> {{three times the size of}} a murre's and had a large yolk. These sailors also introduced rats onto the islands, that preyed upon nests.|$|E
5|$|All dinosaurs lay amniotic {{eggs with}} hard shells made mostly of calcium carbonate. Eggs are usually laid in a nest. Most species create {{somewhat}} elaborate nests, {{which can be}} cups, domes, plates, beds scrapes, mounds, or burrows. Some species of modern bird have no nests; the cliff-nesting common guillemot lays its eggs on bare rock, and male emperor penguins keep eggs between their body and feet. Primitive birds and many non-avialan dinosaurs often lay eggs in communal nests, with males primarily incubating the eggs. While modern birds have only one functional oviduct and lay one egg at a time, more primitive birds and dinosaurs had two oviducts, like crocodiles. Some non-avialan dinosaurs, such as Troodon, exhibited iterative laying, where the adult might lay a pair of eggs every one or two days, and then ensured simultaneous hatching by delaying brooding until all <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> laid.|$|E
5|$|Earwigs {{are among}} the few non-social insect species that show {{maternal}} care. The mother will {{pay close attention to}} the needs of her eggs, such as warmth and protection, though {{studies have shown that the}} mother does not pay attention to the eggs as she collects them. The mother has been shown to pick up wax balls by accident, but they would eventually be rejected as they do not have the proper scent. The mother will also faithfully defend the eggs from predators, not leaving them to eat unless the clutch goes bad. Another distinct maternal care unique to earwigs is that the mother continuously cleans the eggs to protect them from fungi. Studies have found that the urge to clean the eggs persists for days after they are removed; when the <b>eggs</b> <b>were</b> replaced after hatching, the mother continued to clean them for up to 3 months.|$|E
