5|$|SMRT Corporation {{has four}} train depots: Bishan <b>Depot</b> {{is the central}} {{maintenance}} <b>depot</b> with train overhaul facilities, while Changi <b>Depot</b> and Ulu Pandan <b>Depot</b> inspect and house trains overnight. In March 2012, it was announced the new Tuas <b>Depot</b> would be ready in 2016 for the East West MRT Line. The underground Kim Chuan <b>Depot</b> houses trains for the Circle Line and Downtown Line, now jointly managed by the two operators.|$|E
5|$|<b>Depot</b> Town {{was created}} after the Ypsilanti Train <b>Depot</b> was opened in 1838. As the {{railroad}} connected Ypsilanti, MI with Detroit, the area surrounding the <b>depot</b> grew. The commercial community known as <b>Depot</b> Town was {{built over the}} thirty years following {{the arrival of the}} railroad, and most of the buildings standing today were built from 1850 to 1880. In the early years, <b>Depot</b> Town included a flour mill, a large farmers' store, an iron foundry, a fire department, a clothing store, and paved streets. Ypsilanti's original city hall and jail were built just across the Huron River from <b>Depot</b> Town on West Cross Street. As the <b>depot</b> was built one mile north of the Chicago Road (now Michigan Avenue), the community of Ypsilanti was split between competing locations.|$|E
5|$|Following the Richmond <b>Depot,</b> other depots {{started up}} {{throughout}} the South to supply their respective regional forces. Major depots were in Columbus, Athens and Atlanta, Georgia for the Army of Tennessee and Houston, Texas and Shreveport, Louisiana for the Trans-Mississippi forces. The {{use of the}} <b>depot</b> system meant that army-wide uniformity was impossible, as different depots had unique uniforms (Columbus <b>Depot</b> Jackets for instance, had breast pockets, whilst Richmond <b>Depot</b> Jackets did not). This resulted in a varied set of uniforms worn by different Confederate units.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Depots</b> on the Berlin U-Bahn are split, {{just like}} its trains, into two profiles: the wider Großprofil {{and the larger}} Kleinprofil. There is one Kleinprofil and three Großprofil <b>depots.</b> The <b>depots</b> are divided into Hauptwerkstätten (Hw, [...] "main depots") and Betriebswerkstätten (Bw, [...] "service depots"). Service <b>depots</b> only handle minor repairs and {{maintenance}} like changing the windows or removing graffiti. Main <b>depots</b> are used for the full inspections scheduled every few years. Lifting the trains off the tracks is only possible in the main <b>depots.</b>|$|R

5|$|In 2000/01, {{the track}} towards Portishead were relaid to allow rail access to Royal Portbury Docks. In 2010, another section of track was {{reinstated}} {{to allow the}} reopening of South Liberty Lane <b>depot</b> to handle Trans Ocean's wine import business, reducing road traffic. Seven trains terminate at the <b>depot</b> every week. The <b>depot</b> had closed in 1990 {{due to lack of}} demand for its facilities.|$|E
5|$|In August 2014, {{plans for}} the East Coast Integrated <b>Depot,</b> the world's first four-in-one train and bus <b>depot</b> were announced. It will be built at Tanah Merah beside the {{original}} Changi <b>Depot</b> site to serve the East West, Downtown, and Thomson-East Coast lines. The new 36ha <b>depot</b> can house about 220 trains and 550 buses and integrating the <b>depot</b> for both buses and trains will help save close to , or 60 football fields' worth, of land space.|$|E
5|$|SBS Transit has two depots: Sengkang <b>Depot</b> houses trains for the North East MRT Line, the Sengkang LRT Line and the Punggol LRT Line. Kim Chuan <b>Depot</b> is {{currently}} jointly operated with SMRT for the Downtown Line. Major operations {{will eventually be}} shifted to the main Gali Batu <b>Depot</b> by end 2015 although {{it will continue to}} operate on a minor capacity.|$|E
25|$|Trent Bridge and Parliament Street <b>Depots</b> {{remain in}} use as bus <b>depots</b> for Nottingham City Transport.|$|R
50|$|Both <b>depots</b> {{are used}} {{not only for}} the storage of trolley buses, but also for diesel powered buses. In {{contrast}} with the <b>depots</b> used solely for diesel buses, these <b>depots</b> are fully covered, for the better safeguarding of the fleet.|$|R
50|$|Route 400 was {{initially}} operated out of Kingsgrove and Randwick <b>depots.</b> In 1993 services operated by Randwick {{were transferred to}} Waverley. In a reorganisation of routes operated by various <b>depots</b> in 2013, some trips were allocated to Port Botany and Randwick <b>depots.</b>|$|R
5|$|The Class 455/8s {{were built}} between 1982 and 1984. These include all 46 Southern units ({{allocated}} to Stewarts Lane <b>depot)</b> and 28 allocated to South Western Railway (at Wimbledon <b>depot).</b>|$|E
5|$|The Q53, {{originally}} being {{operated by}} Triboro Coach operated from the LaGuardia <b>Depot</b> in East Elmhurst. However, after its takeover by the MTA, it {{was transferred to}} College Point <b>Depot,</b> a former Queens Surface Corporation facility. It went back to LaGuardia <b>Depot</b> on January 8, 2017.|$|E
5|$|The {{first batch}} of {{aircraft}} arrived in South Africa in September 1919 at the Artillery <b>Depot</b> at Roberts Heights, Pretoria where an Air <b>Depot</b> was established on 1 January 1920. The combined facility was {{then known as}} the Aircraft and Artillery <b>Depot.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Depots</b> carry a {{wide range}} of {{vehicles}} to cover most eventualities, depending on the location of the depot; small urban <b>depots</b> carry street sweeper vehicles and small gully emptiers, while larger rural and motorway-based <b>depots</b> hold fleets of winter service vehicles and engineering vehicles, and often tow trucks and breakdown vehicles for rescuing broken down or stranded equipment. Other vehicles commonly kept at <b>depots</b> include lawnmowers, sprayers and road markers.|$|R

5000|$|The {{presence}} of BAT in adult humans was discovered during FDG-PET scans to detect metastatic cancers. Using these scans and data from human autopsies, several BAT <b>depots</b> have been identified. In infants, BAT <b>depots</b> include, {{but are not}} limited to: interscapular, supraclavicular, suprarenal, pericardial, para-aortic and around the pancreas, kidney and trachea. These <b>depots</b> gradually get more white fat-like during adulthood. In adults, the <b>depots</b> that are most often detected in FDG-PET scans are the supraclavicular, paravertebral, mediastinal, para-aortic and suprarenal ones. [...] It remains to be determined whether these <b>depots</b> are 'classical' BAT or beige/brite fat.|$|R
5|$|The {{station is}} at the {{junction}} of Gunnersbury Lane (A4000) and Bollo Lane. To the south-west of the station is the former Acton Works, central overhaul and engineering works for the London Underground. It is now home to the London Transport Museum's reserve collection of rail and road vehicles (as known as London Transport Museum <b>Depot</b> or Museum <b>Depot).</b> The museum <b>depot</b> is {{opened to the public}} on a number of weekends throughout the year. To the north of the station is the District line's Ealing Common <b>Depot.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{companies}} were affected by inability to reach their premises even where the premises themselves were largely unaffected by the blast. Criticism was expressed by local citizens and the local MP that originally the <b>depot</b> had been constructed away from other buildings, but that developmental pressures had led to both houses and commercial premises being built near the <b>depot.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beginning {{with the}} arrival of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's South Branch line to Romney in the 1880s, a {{passenger}} train conducted three trips daily (morning, noon, and evening) from the Romney <b>Depot</b> at Valley to Green Spring on the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad's main line. During the 1930s, passenger ridership on the South Branch line began to decline, and passenger service was finally discontinued shortly thereafter. A special passenger train carried students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind, arriving at Romney <b>Depot</b> in Valley in the fall, and departing in the spring to take the students home. The last special train to transport the students of the West Virginia Schools for the Deaf and Blind departed Romney <b>Depot</b> in the spring of 1941. Freight operations from Romney <b>Depot</b> later ceased, and the station was closed and demolished soon after.|$|E
50|$|However, their <b>depots</b> {{varied in}} size from Preston, Selborne Street, and Bootle <b>Depots,</b> which both {{accommodated}} close on one hundred vehicles; to small <b>depots</b> like Dalton-in-Furness with a handful. There were out-stations too, at Appleby, Bowness-on-Solway and Sedbergh, the out-station never having a particular vehicle allocated permanently.|$|R
50|$|Trains on line 10 are {{serviced}} by the <b>depots</b> at Auteuil, which {{are connected to}} the tracks of the terminus Porte d'Auteuil. These <b>depots</b> are entirely underground; other than tunnels, an escalator located on the sidewalk of the avenue du Géneral-Sarrail provides access. The <b>depots</b> are connected to line 9 as well, however line 9 has not used these <b>depots</b> since the opening of those at Boulogne connected to Pont de Sèvres.|$|R

All were initially allocated to Wimbledon <b>depot</b> working services on the Central and South Western divisions. The Central Division 455/8s were transferred to Selhurst in 1986 after modifications to the <b>depot</b> were completed. All were delivered in British Rail blue and white livery, before being repainted in Network SouthEast white, blue and red livery from 1986. In May 1991, 455743 was renumbered 455750 and renamed Wimbledon Traincare <b>depot</b> {{in recognition of the}} <b>depot</b> obtaining BS5750 quality services accreditation.|$|E
5|$|<b>Depot</b> Town is a {{commercial}} area, with some residences above storefronts, in Ypsilanti, Michigan's historic district. <b>Depot</b> Town proper consists of East Cross Street from the Huron River to North River Street, {{and a small}} area on the 300-block of North River Street. However, several blocks in the surrounding area are also {{commonly referred to as}} part of <b>Depot</b> Town. These areas include Riverside Park, Frog Island Park (both of which are on the Huron River), and River Street extending north and south for several blocks. First established in the late 1830s, most of the buildings standing today were constructed between 1850 and 1880. Over the years, <b>Depot</b> Town has included hotels, an Underground Railroad station, an American Civil War barracks, and a building that has housed a bar and restaurant continuously for more than 150 years, switching to soft drinks during Prohibition. Today the area is dominated by restaurants and stores. <b>Depot</b> Town also hosts several large summer festivals each year, as well as weekly bike nights and cruise nights.|$|E
5|$|Fitting new {{traction}} equipment both improves Miles per Breakdown values and overall reduces operating and maintenance costs. As the trains will therefore {{be in the}} <b>depot</b> less, it will allow South West Trains to acquire additional rolling stock without the {{need to build a}} new <b>depot.</b>|$|E
25|$|Some <b>depots</b> were {{targeted}} by thieves – whalers and other ship men {{who saw the}} <b>depots</b> {{as a source of}} free food and provisions. To discourage raiding, clothing left at the <b>depots</b> was often distinctively marked, so it could be identified, and warnings were painted on the huts.|$|R

40|$|Locoregional {{delivery}} of anticancer drugs {{is an attractive}} approach to minimize adverse effects associated with intravenous chemotherapy. Polymer-based drug <b>depots</b> injected or implanted intratumorally or adjacent to the tumor can provide long-term local drug exposure. This review highlights studies in which drug-eluting <b>depots</b> have been applied locally {{in the treatment of}} cancer. In many cases such drug <b>depots</b> are used for prevention of tumor recurrence after surgery to eradicate remaining tumor cells. Clinical success has been reported for the treatment of brain cancer and liver cancer, and preclinical studies showed proof-of-concept for inhaled drug <b>depots</b> in lung cancer and intraperitoneally injected <b>depots</b> for the treatment of abdominal cancer...|$|R

5|$|In 1861, the New London Northern Railroad succeeded the New London, Willimantic, and Palmer. That year, the {{railroad}} constructed a freight <b>depot</b> and steamboat wharf (likely {{also used for}} passenger trains) along Water Street. The <b>depot</b> burned on May 8, 1864, but was rebuilt on the same site.|$|E
5|$|In 1983, {{the station}} was finally closed when Conrail and the newly formed Metro-North Railroad {{announced}} that the new stations along the Erie's former high speed freight line, the Graham Line, would take over freight and passenger service. Trains to Harriman would stop at a new park-and-ride built to the south. The former 1911 station <b>depot,</b> however, remained standing until 2006, when the Harriman village building inspector forced the new owners of the right-of-way for the old main line, Norfolk Southern, to either revamp or demolish the former station <b>depot.</b> The railway chose the latter, and in May 2006, a excavator tore down the 1911 <b>depot,</b> with the remains taken to a dump in nearby Hillburn.|$|E
