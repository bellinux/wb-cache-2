50|$|The <b>Desktop</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Interface</b> (DMI) {{generates a}} {{standard}} framework for managing and tracking components in a desktop, notebook or server computer, by abstracting these components from {{the software that}} manages them. The development of DMI marked the first move by the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF) into desktop-management standards.Before the introduction of DMI, no standardized source of information could provide details about components in a personal computer.|$|E
50|$|The {{purpose of}} WMI is {{to define a}} {{proprietary}} set of environment-independent specifications which allow management information to be shared between management applications. WMI prescribes enterprise management standards and related technologies for Windows that work with existing management standards, such as <b>Desktop</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Interface</b> (DMI) and SNMP. WMI complements these other standards by providing a uniform model. This model represents the managed environment through which management data from any source can be accessed in a common way.|$|E

50|$|In computing, the System Management BIOS (SMBIOS) {{specification}} defines data structures (and access methods) {{that can}} be used to read information stored in the BIOS of a computer. Circa 1999, it became part of the domain of the Distributed Management Task Force (DMTF). Before this integration, SMBIOS functionality had the name DMIBIOS, since it interacted with <b>Desktop</b> <b>Management</b> <b>Interface</b> (DMI). At approximately the same time Microsoft started to require that OEMs and BIOS vendors support the interface/data-set in order to have Microsoft certification.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: <b>Desktop</b> <b>management</b> is {{probably}} the most resource-consuming task for the typical operations and support team, regardless of being frequently overlooked as not as complex or specialized as core network operations and management. Nowadays this scenario is even worst, since the increasing number and complexity of desktop systems was not matched by satisfactory management solutions – despite the relative success of products such as Intel’s Landesk or Microsoft’s SMS. In order to address this problem, we are exploring a different approach to <b>desktop</b> <b>management,</b> through the design and implementation of the OpenDMS management framework. This open source framework differs from available products in several points, such as earlier remote management mechanisms (prior to operating system load), incorporation of existing open standards, a network-centric architecture, operating system neutrality and tighter integration between traditional PCs, Thin Clients and Network PCs. In this paper we discuss the current status of <b>desktop</b> <b>management</b> solutions and we present an overview of the OpenDMS approach, including its most relevant technical foundations and an application scenario...|$|R
