500|$|Przemysł II {{was able}} to end the dispute between Leszek and Ziemomysł with their local nobility definitively. The Duke of Inowrocław had to agree to two conditions: firstly, in his court all the noble {{families}} would be well-tolerated and respected, and secondly, he had put a distance from his German advisors. In addition Ziemomysł also <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> surrender of the towns of Kruszwica and Radziejów to Bolesław the Pious and Wyszogród to Duke Mestwin II of Pomerelia. The friendly relations between Przemysł II and the Kuyavia Dukes proved to be durable and survived {{to the end of}} his reign. The expedition against Brandenburg in 1278 was the last important event in Bolesław the Pious' life. [...] "Maximus trumphator de Teutonicis" [...] (in: The highest winner on the Germans), died on 13 or 14 April 1279 in Kalisz. Without male heirs, shortly before his death he declared his nephew his only and legitimate heir and urged him to take care of his wife Jolenta-Helena and his two underage daughters, Hedwig and Anna.|$|E

500|$|The brigade was by now {{reduced to}} three battalions, as the Argylls had been {{withdrawn}} to Pusan {{just prior to}} the battle, in preparation for their embarkation. The Middlesex were also on stand-by for embarkation, and were kept in reserve. As such, with the width of the valley precluding the establishment of continuous linear defensive, Burke was forced to place his two available battalions on the high points on either side of it, with 3 RAR occupying Hill 504 to the east of the river and 2 PPCLI occupying Hill 677 to the west. Meanwhile, Sudok San (Hill 794) to the north-west—a massive hill nearly [...] high—was left undefended by necessity. Together these three hills formed a naturally strong defensive position, well suited to blocking a major advance. Regardless, the brigade position suffered from a number of deficiencies, being exposed without flank protection, while the central sector was not occupied because the Middlesex were away to the north with the guns. Likewise, until the return of the New Zealanders the brigade would have little artillery support; as such if large Chinese forces arrived before these two units returned the forward companies would be without support and would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> probability that they would be cut-off. 3 RAR—whose line of communications ran [...] through the exposed central sector of the valley—would be particularly exposed.|$|E

2500|$|I {{am trying}} here to prevent anyone saying the really foolish {{thing that people}} often say about Him: I'm ready to accept Jesus as a great moral teacher, but I don't accept his claim to be God. [...] That {{is the one thing}} we must not say. [...] A man who was merely a man and said the sort of things Jesus said would not be a great moral teacher. [...] He would either be a lunatic — on the level with the man who says he is a poached egg — or else he would be the Devil of Hell. You must make your choice. [...] Either this man was, and is, the Son of God, or else a madman or {{something}} worse. You can shut him up for a fool, you can spit at him and kill him as a demon or you can fall at his feet and call him Lord and God, but let us not come with any patronizing nonsense about his being a great human teacher. He has not left that open to us. He did not intend to. ... Now it seems to me obvious that He was neither a lunatic nor a fiend: and consequently, however strange or terrifying or unlikely it may seem, I <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> view that He was and is God.|$|E
2500|$|Sarkar {{proposed}} a reinterpretation of Humanism [...] by integrating into its ideological framework {{the idea of}} uniformity of all life, explaining that all living beings belong to a [...] "universal family" [...] deserving the equal care and respect. Thus, he conceptualized what he {{referred to as a}} new humanism or Neohumanism [...]„Neohumanism is humanism of the past, humanism of the present, and humanism – newly explained – of the future. Explaining humanity and humanism in a new light will widen the path of human progress and will make it easier to tread. Neohumanism will give new inspiration and provide a new interpretation for the very idea of human existence. It will help people understand that human beings(...), will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>accept</b> <b>the</b> great responsibility of taking care of the entire universe...“ Inspired by Indian spiritual philosophy (see advaita vedanta), Sarkar calls for the acknowledgment of the fundamental connectedness not only between individuals and their fellow human beings but also between humans and all life. Sarkar enounces that though physically different, all existence is metaphysically united and fundamentally one collective body composed of all the material and supra-material elements of this universe. Hence PROUT propounds the celebration of diversity and multiculturalism, emphasizing, through its policies, the abolishment of inequality in all its forms, be that religious superiority, racism, sexism, prejudices against social groups, etc. According to Sarkar, PROUT treads a path of socio-economic liberation for the common people [...] , where the desire for a more progressive society is driven by Neohumanistic values stirred by the ancient philosophies of the east.|$|E

Also the Prussian Ten Thousand--Old Dessauer leading them, General Roder having fallen ill--burnt something: an Islet in the Rhine, if I recollect, [...] "Islet of Larch near Bingen," [...] where the French had a post; which and whom the Old Dessauer burnt away. And then Seckendorf, {{at the head of}} thirty thousand, he, after long delays, marched to Trarbach in the {{interior}} Moselle Country; and got into some explosive sputter of battle with Belleisle, one afternoon,--some say, rather beating Belleisle; but a good judge says, it was a mutual flurry and terror they threw one another into. [OEuvres de Frederic, i. 168.] Seckendorf meant to try again on the morrow: but there came an estafette that night: [...] "Preliminaries signed (Vienna, 3d October, 1735);--try no farther!" [...] ["Cessation is to be, 5th November for Germany, 15th for Italy; Preliminaries" [...] were, Vienna, [...] "3d October," [...] 1735 (Scholl, ii. 945).] And this was the second Rhine-Campaign, {{and the end of the}} Kaiser's French War.
