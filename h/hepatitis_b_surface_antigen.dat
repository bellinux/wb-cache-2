40|$|Recombinant adenoviruses {{carrying}} the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus <b>surface</b> <b>antigen</b> coding sequence in the adenovirus E 3 region were constructed using DNA from either adenovirus type 5 or an adenovirus type 5 E 3 -region deletion mutant. Both of these recombinant adenoviruses replicated {{as efficiently as}} wild-type adenovirus in all human cells tested, including the human diploid cell strain WI- 38. This indicates that insertion of the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus <b>surface</b> <b>antigen</b> gene into the E 3 region does not significantly affect viral replication. Human cells infected with these recombinant adenoviruses secreted immunoreactive <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus <b>surface</b> <b>antigen.</b> Since a practical small animal model for human adenoviruses was lacking, a hamster model was developed to evaluate the immunogenic potential of these recombinant adenoviruses. Upon intranasal inoculation, both wild-type adenovirus and the adenovirus E 3 -region deletion mutant replicated in the lungs of these animals and induced an antibody response against adenovirus. Hamsters similarly immunized with the live recombinant adenoviruses produced antibody against both adenovirus and <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus <b>surface</b> <b>antigen...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractHepatitis delta virus (HDV) is a {{defective}} virus requiring the <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus (HBV) to provide <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>surface</b> <b>antigens</b> as the envelope protein. The <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> <b>surface</b> <b>antigens</b> are posttranslationally modified by N-linked glycosylation, and its significance in HDV assembly was investigated with a cotransfection system using human hepatoma cell line Huh- 7. After the N-linked glycosylation of HBsAg {{was blocked by}} tunicamycin treatment, the packaging of HDV in the culture system could be suppressed to a level as low as 5 – 10 % of the untreated control. The extent of inhibition correlated with the increased concentrations of tunicamycin. In contrast, the loss of HBsAg glycosylation {{did not affect the}} efficiency of assembly of HBV particles. When the N-linked glycosylation site of small HBsAg at amino acid 146 was mutated from asparagine to glutamine, the mutant HBsAg packaged only a modest amount of HDV particles. The quantity and kinetics of formation of HDV particles in culture system were reduced by the depletion of HBsAg glycosylation. Therefore HDV, similar to influenza and vesicular stomatitis viruses, depends on glycosylation of the envelope proteins as a signal for envelope protein maturation and for virion formation...|$|R

40|$|Repeated {{intradermal}} inoculations of calves with wild-type {{vaccinia virus}} and recombinant vaccinia viruses expressing human <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus <b>surface</b> <b>antigen</b> and herpes simplex virus, type 1, glycoprotein D produced characteristic pox lesions {{at each site}} of injection.

Subsequent inoculations produced a less severe area of redness, swelling, necrosis, and scab formation. No other signs of illness, such as an elevation in temperature, were noted in the calves. Vaccinia virus was isolated in low titers from scabs taken at various times after inoculation.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{infectious}} <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus represents 42 nm spherical double-shelled particles. However, {{analysis of}} blood from <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus carriers revealed {{the presence of}} smaller 22 nm particles consisting of a viral envelope surface protein. These particles are highly immunogenic and {{have been used in}} the design of <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus vaccine produced in yeast. Upon expression in yeast, these proteins form virus-like particles that are used for parenteral immunization. Therefore, the DNA fragment encoding <b>hepatitis</b> <b>B</b> virus <b>surface</b> <b>antigen</b> was introduced into Agrobacterium tumerifacience LBA 4404 and used to obtain transgenic lupin (Lupinus luteus L.) and lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) cv.

A synergistic enhancement of the antibody was obtained when both adjuvants were administered together. Cell-mediated immunity to HBsAg, tested by the proliferative response of lymph node cells to the antigen, was also shown to be induced in mice treated with alum-associated murabutide. When administered with natural HBsAg, murabutide produced titers of total antibodies as high as did alum but lower titers of specific immunoglobulin E.
