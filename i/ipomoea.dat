5|$|Because {{it is so}} {{far from}} the nearest major landmass, the {{ecosystem}} of Kohala has experienced the phenomenon of geographic isolation, resulting in an ecosystem radically different from that of other places. Invasive species introduced by man present a problem to Kohala's ecosystem, as they push native species out of their habitat. There are several initiatives to preserve Kohala's ecosystem. Crops, especially sweet potato (<b>Ipomoea</b> batatas), have been harvested on the Leeward side of the volcano for centuries as well. The northern part of the island is named after the mountain, with two districts named North and South Kohala. King Kamehameha I, the first King of the Kingdom of Hawaii, was born in North Kohala, near Hawi.|$|E

5|$|In 2001, biologically active hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were {{isolated}} from tobacco which activated {{the production of}} protease inhibitors {{in a similar way}} to systemin in tomatoes. Although they are structurally unrelated to systemins, their similar function resulted in them being named hydroxyproline-rich systemins (HypSys). Following the initial discovery other HypSys peptides were found in tomato, Petunia and black nightshade. In 2007, HypSys were found outside the Solanaceae, in sweet potato (<b>Ipomoea</b> batatas) and sequence analysis identified HypSys analogs in poplar (Populus trichocarpa) and coffee (Coffea canephora). Systemins are highly conserved between species, whereas HypSys are more divergent but all contain a conserved proline or hydroxyproline-rich central domain.|$|E

40|$|Certain {{strains of}} the {{bacterial}} sweet potato pathogen Streptomyces <b>ipomoeae</b> produce the bacteriocin ipomicin, which inhibits other sensitive {{strains of the}} same species. Within the signal-sequence-encoding portion of the ipomicin structural gene ipoA exists a single rare TTA codon, which is recognized in Streptomyces bacteria by the temporally accumulating bldA leucyl tRNA. In this study, ipomicin was shown to stably accumulate in culture supernatants of S. <b>ipomoeae</b> in a growth-regulated manner that did not coincide with the pattern of ipoA expression. Similar growth-regulated production of ipomicin in Streptomyces coelicolor containing the cloned ipoA gene {{was found to be}} directly dependent on translation of the ipoA TTA codon by the bldA leucyl tRNA. The results here suggest that bldA-dependent translation of the S. <b>ipomoeae</b> ipoA gene leads to growth-regulated production of the ipomicin precursor, which upon processing to the mature form and secretion stably accumulates in the extracellular environment. To our knowledge, this is the first example of bldA regulation of a bacteriocin in the streptomycetes...|$|R

40|$|Strains of {{the sweet}} potato soil rot {{pathogen}} Streptomyces <b>ipomoeae</b> had previously been divided into three groups based {{on their ability to}} inhibit one another during pairwise cocultivation. While group I strains are not antagonistic to members of the other groups, group II and group III strains produce separate substances that are inhibitory to strains outside their respective cognate groups. Here, we purified the group III inhibitory substance from the culture supernatant of a representative strain and found that it consists of a single 10 -kDa cationic protein which is bacteriolytic for S. <b>ipomoeae</b> group I and II strains but which showed no inhibitory function against other streptomycetes or other bacterial genera tested. The structural gene for the inhibitor was cloned from a chromosomal library of the producing strain, and while the gene sequence revealed that the inhibitor is initially made in a larger precursor form, the deduced mature protein showed no significant homology to other known proteins.

25|$|The {{sweet potato}} was grown in Polynesia before western exploration. Sweet potato has been radiocarbon-dated in the Cook Islands to 1000 AD, and current {{thinking}} {{is that it was}} brought to central Polynesia around 700 AD, possibly by Polynesians who had traveled to South America and back, and spread across Polynesia to Hawaii and New Zealand from there. It is possible, however, that South Americans brought it to the Pacific, although this is unlikely as it was the Polynesians who had a strong maritime tradition and not the native South Americans. The theory that the plant could spread by floating seeds across the ocean is not supported by evidence. Another point is that the sweet potato in Polynesia is the cultivated <b>Ipomoea</b> batatas, which is generally spread by vine cuttings and not by seeds.|$|E
500|$|A. brownii has a {{very limited}} range; it is found only on the [...] island of Nihoa, located [...] {{northwest}} of Kauai.

40|$|Streptomycetes are {{actually}} {{considered one of}} the main groups of ligninolytic microoganisms producing a lignin-carbohydate complex named APPL (acid precipitable polymeric lignin) when growing on lignocellulosic materials. Although in these conditions the production of hemicellulolytic and oxidative extracellular enzymes were reported the specific role of laccases in lignin degradation is poorly understood. SilA, a thermostable salt-resistant and pH-versatile laccase produced by Streptomyces <b>ipomoeae</b> CECT 3341 was recently discovered and their particular characteristics make attractive to deep in its knowledge for biotechnological and environmental purposes. Pyrolysis/GC-MS was used to analyse the behaviour of the laccase-producing strain (SilA strain) and a laccase-negative mutant (SilA - strain) when growing on wheat straw in solid-state fermentation (SSF). Quantitative yields of APPL and the relative abundance of lignin-derived compounds were much higher for SilA strain than for SilA - showing a higher solubilizing activity of S. <b>ipomoeae</b> wild-type on lignocellulosic residues. Nonetheless the patterns of lignin derived compounds found in the APPL pyrograms were similar for both strains and distinct from the control showing a shortening of lignin propyl side-chains. Our results demonstrate that SilA laccase is a key enzyme in the lignin solubilization by S. <b>ipomoeae</b> and also points to the involvement of other oxidative enzymatic activities distinct to laccase in this process...|$|R

40|$|To better {{understand}} the evolutionary history {{of a group of}} organisms, an accurate estimate of the species phylogeny must be known. Traditionally, gene trees have served as a proxy for the species tree, although it was acknowledged early on that these trees represented different evolutionary processes. Discordances among gene trees and between the gene trees and the species tree are also expected in closely related species that have rapidly diverged, due to processes such as the incomplete sorting of ancestral polymorphisms. Recently, methods have been developed for the explicit estimation of species trees, using information from multilocus gene trees while accommodating heterogeneity among them. Here we have used three distinct approaches to estimate the species tree for five Phytophthora pathogens, including P. infestans, the causal agent of late blight disease in potato and tomato. Our concatenation-based "supergene" approach was unable to resolve relationships even with data from both the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes, and from multiple isolates per species. Our multispecies coalescent approach using both Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods was able to estimate a moderately supported species tree showing a close relationship among P. infestans, P. andina, and P. <b>ipomoeae.</b> The topology of the species tree was also identical to the dominant phylogenetic history estimated in our third approach, Bayesian concordance analysis. Our results support previous suggestions that P. andina is a hybrid species, with P. infestans representing one parental lineage. The other parental lineage is not known, but represents an independent evolutionary lineage more closely related to P. <b>ipomoeae.</b> While all five species likely originated in the New World, further study is needed to determine when and under what conditions this hybridization event may have occurred...|$|R
500|$|There is {{evidence}} of pre-modern agriculture on the leeward slopes of Kohala.

The optimal rainfall level for the sweet potato lies between [...] per year. A combination of factors makes the rainfall at Kohala variable both from location to location and from year to year. In addition, Kohala is buffeted by strong winds, which are directly correlated to soil erosion; ancient farmers utilized a series of earthen embarkments and stone walls to protect their crops.

40|$|Phytophthora nicotianae {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} plant pathogens affecting a variety of plants, causing black shank of tobacco, among several other devastating diseases. Herein, we assembled the mitochondrial genome of P. nicotianae and analyzed its gene content and genome structure, performed comparative mitochondrial genomics analysis, and assessed phylogenetic relationships among oomycetes species. The circular mitogenome is 37, 561 bp long, with 38 protein-coding genes, 25 transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and 2 ribosomal RNA genes (rrnl and rrns). The mitochondrial genome showed a biased A/T usage versus G/C. The overall gene content and size of the P. nicotianae mitogenome are identical to those of other published Phytophthora mitogenomes. Interestingly, collinearity analysis using an existing ∼ 10 k inversion region (including 11 genes and 8 tRNAs) revealed that Phytophthora andina, Phytophthora infestans, Phytophthora mirabilis, Phytophthora <b>ipomoeae,</b> and Phytophthora phaseoli differed from Phytophthora nicotianae, Phytophthora sojae, Phytophthora ramorum, and Phytophthora polonica. Moreover, inverted repeat regions were found to be absent among species of the Peronosporales when compared with species from the Pythiales and Saprolegniales. A phylogenomic investigation based on 29 protein-coding genes demonstrated that Phytophthora is monophyletic, and placed P. nicotianae close to the clade including P. mirabilis, P. <b>ipomoeae,</b> P. andina, P. infestans, and P. phaseoli. Furthermore, we discovered six new candidate DNA molecular markers (rpl 6, atp 8, nad 11, rps 2, rps 3, and rps 4) based on these mitogenomes that would be suitable for species identification in the oomycetes, which have the same identification level as the whole mitogenome and ribosomal DNA sequences. These new molecular markers can not only provide a quick preview of the species without mitogenome information, but will also help to gain better understanding of the oomycetes pathogens and developing treatment or monitoring strategies...|$|R
