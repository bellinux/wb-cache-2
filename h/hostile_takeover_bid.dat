5|$|By the 1950s, {{with the}} area around Woking by this time heavily populated, rental income from the LNC's land {{holdings}} was an extremely valuable asset, and in May 1955 the Alliance Property Company launched a <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bid</b> {{with the aim of}} using the cemetery's land for property development. The bid failed, but prompted the LNC to secure the passing of the London Necropolis Act 1956, allowing the sale of all remaining surplus land. A new company, the Brookwood Estates Realisation Company, was founded to oversee the disposal of the remaining unsold lands as well as the cemetery reserve, finally formally recognising that Brookwood Cemetery would never expand beyond its original boundaries.|$|E
5|$|The former South {{station was}} near the A322 road {{making it one of}} the most easily {{accessed}} parts of the cemetery once the railway had closed, and the land surrounding it was now redundant. As part of the London Necropolis Act 1956 the LNC obtained Parliamentary consent to convert the disused Anglican chapel of 1854 into a crematorium, using a newer chapel built by Cyril Tubbs in 1908–09 for funeral services and the station building for coffin storage and as a refreshment room for those attending cremations. Suffering cash flow problems and distracted by the <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bid,</b> the LNC management never proceeded with the scheme.|$|E
5|$|In 1969 {{the large}} Allied Breweries combine {{initiated}} a <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bid</b> for Boddingtons, which valued {{the company at}} £5million. Charles Boddington took {{the unusual step of}} issuing a spirited defence of the company to the shareholders: You will be only too aware that present-day pressures bear heavily towards the elimination of individuality and character in many consumer goods. There is an inexorable progression towards the mass-produced nationwide product of standardised quality. You, however, are still, at this moment in time, a shareholder in one of the remaining independent brewery companies whose traditional draught beers have a reputation for quality and individual character beyond the immediate area of the North of England in which we operate... The takeover of Boddingtons and its consequent elimination can achieve very little. It will do nothing for the national economy, add nothing to the nation's exports, and contribute nothing at all to the quality of life that we are all used to enjoy.|$|E

40|$|This article {{summarizes}} the corporate takeover regime and defensive measures against <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> in Slovenia. Although takeover legislation does not differentiate between <b>hostile</b> and friendly <b>takeover,</b> it prescribes {{the limitation of}} powers {{for the management of}} the target company, with the intention of preventing the use of defensive measures against the <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover.</b> In light of an expected rise in <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> in Slovenia, the Corporate Act and the Takeover Act are analysed and accordingly the array of possible preventive measures as well as ad-hoc measures against hostile bids identified and evaluated for their anti-takeover effectiveness. A <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> in Slovenia usually involves a hostile public tender offer at a substantial premium over the prevailing market price for a substantial percentage of the target company’s stock. Managers of target companies use in takeover battles a variety of defensive tactics, which could be controversial because they pose a conflict of interest for management. Duty of neutrality of the management of the target company during takeover process is therefore discussed in connection with the limitation of use of applicable ad hoc defence mechanisms in that period...|$|R
5|$|In 1999, the chairman, Lord Alexander of Weedon, {{announced}} a merger with Legal & General {{in a friendly}} £10.7billion deal, the first between a bank and an insurance company in UK history. The move was poorly received in the London financial markets and NatWest's share price fell substantially. Seen as a driver of the ill-advised investment banking expansion, Derek Wanless {{was forced to resign}} as chief executive following the appointment of Sir David Rowland (who became executive chairman). Also in 1999, in response to the much reduced NatWest market capitalisation, the much smaller Bank of Scotland made a <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bid</b> for NatWest. The Bank of Scotland's aim was to break up the NatWest Group and dispose of its non-retail assets. NatWest was forced to abandon its merger, but refused to agree to a takeover by a rival bank. The Royal Bank of Scotland tabled another hostile offer and trumped the Bank of Scotland with a £21billion bid. The takeover of NatWest in early 2000 was the biggest in UK history. National Westminster Bank, once Britain's most profitable bank, was delisted from the London Stock Exchange and became, with its subsidiaries, component parts of the Royal Bank of Scotland Group. The outcome of this bitter struggle set the tone for a round of consolidation in the financial sector as it prepared for a new age of fierce global competition. The Royal Bank of Scotland Group became the second largest bank in the UK and Europe (after HSBC) and the fifth largest in the world by market capitalisation. According to Forbes Global 2000, it was then the 13th largest company in the world. NatWest was retained as a distinct brand with its own banking licence, but many back office functions were merged with those of the Royal Bank, leading to over 18,000 job losses.|$|E

40|$|Using the Delaware Supreme Court's Time-Warner {{decision}} of July 1989 as a focal point, we study defeated <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> {{before and after}} July 1989 to assess the direct effects of stronger takeover impediments on takeover defense tactics used to defeat bids and the resulting shareholder wealth outcomes and managerial turnover. We find that firms that defeated <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> after July 1989 shifted away {{from the use of}} active takeover defenses (repurchases, special dividends, greenmail, and leverage increases). Nevertheless, shareholders of firms that defeat a takeover experienced slightly better wealth outcomes in the 1990 s than in the 1980 s. We also find increased managerial turnover rates after defeating a <b>takeover</b> <b>bid</b> post Time-Warner, suggesting that managers that defeat <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bids</b> did not become more entrenched due to greater takeover impediments relative to prior years.

25|$|In July 1996, Clearly Canadian Beverage Corporation {{initiated}} a $40million <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bid</b> of Sun-Rype. The reasons behind this attempt were to immediately double Clearly Canadian's revenues {{and give it}} use of Sun-Rype's bottling plant, thus centralizing its production facilities. In order to initiate the takeover, Clearly Canadian began buying as many shares as possible from local apple growers who had been issued the shares {{over the last five}} decades in return for the process-grade apples used in production by Sun-Rype. At the time of the takeover attempt, Sun-Rype was still a co-operative organization, not a public company, so there were few ways for shareholders to sell their shares.|$|E
25|$|In August 2010, BHP Billiton made a <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bid</b> worth US$40billion for the Potash Corporation of Saskatchewan.

This acquisition marked a major strategic move by BHP outside hard commodities and commenced the diversification {{of its business}} away from resources with high exposure to carbon price risk (coal, petroleum, iron ore). The takeover bid was opposed by the Government of Saskatchewan under Premier Brad Wall.

40|$|Fairness, {{upon which}} the equal {{opportunity}} rule presently governing {{the distribution of the}} takeover premium is predicated, is not the most appropriate criterion for making policy choices for Australian takeover law and practice. Pursuit of equal treatment in every takeover transaction has the potential to reduce the incidence, or success, of <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bids.</b> Given the important role that the <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> process plays in ensuring the quality of corporate management and the efficient allocation of resources within industries, a reduction in takeover activity is likely to leave shareholders and society as a whole worse off.

In undertaking this task, policy makers would serve the interests of investors in public companies and the economic order of society generally better if they adopted shareholder and social welfare enhancement as the criterion for developing the applicable rule in this area.

500|$|However, {{the mortal}} {{blow to the}} company derived from Interco's {{response}} to a <b>hostile</b> <b>takeover</b> <b>bid.</b> [...] In 1988, Steven and Mitchell Rales, of the Cardinal Acquisition Corporation, offered $2.5 billion for the company. [...] In response to the offer, Interco's board authorized $1.95 billion in additional debt to buyback stock. [...] Senior management hired Goldman, Sachs & Company to restructure the company, including a plan to sell 16 of Interco's 20 companies. [...] While this restructuring plan successfully avoided the hostile takeover, the company was unable to support its debt payments in the subsequent years. [...] From 1989 to 1991, Interco was forced to divest the totality of its shoe and apparel divisions {{in an attempt to}} remain solvent. [...] While the majority of these wholly owned subsidiaries were profitable before their liquidation, the full value of these assets was never realized by Interco, as the parent company struggled to pay off its debts raised primarily through the acquisition of junk bonds. [...] The combination of selling the majority of its companies, while being saddled by over $2 billion in debt, created unsustainable negative cash flow, resulting in Inteco's bankruptcy in 1991. [...] Thus in spite of being a profitable subsidiary, International Hat was liquidated in 1989 in a fire sale to Paramount Cap Company.|$|E

A review of the case studies five year on finds that that, almost without exception, mergers led to large-scale job losses and asset disposals. However, almost none of the bids was considered by financial commentators, at this point, to have generated shareholder value for investors in the merged company. While there is therefore clear evidence that the Takeover Code is effective in protecting the interests of target shareholders, the implications of the Code for efficiency in corporate performance are much less certain...|$|R
