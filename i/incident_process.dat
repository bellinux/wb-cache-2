40|$|According to the Petroleum Safety Authority Norway (PSA, 2017), {{the safety}} trend within {{the oil and}} gas {{industry}} is moving in the wrong direction with regard to high-potential incidents. In order to achieve a positive development again, there is a need for further improvement in terms of identifying and implementing effective preventive measures and learning from incidents. Due to this, it is of high importance to gather more knowledge about which types of measures are effective, and which are not. In 2011, the PSA conducted a study on causal factors and conditions linked to gas release incidents (PSA, 2011). The study revealed that the majority of the direct causes were linked to technical and human factors, while the underlying causes primarily were linked to organizational factors. The PSA (2013) concludes that to reduce the number of gas leak incidents, a higher focus on organizational measures and learning is needed. The objective of this study is therefore to generate knowledge on effective organizational measures and learning processes of practical importance. In order to achieve this objective, the thesis is based on two intertwined research questions: 1) “What are the characteristics of effective organizational measures and learning from incident processes?” and 2) “What can {{the oil and gas}} industry and the concrete company studied in this thesis acquire from these characteristics in their work with prevention of high-potential incidents?”. In order to answer the research questions, a literature review, semi-structured interviews and document analysis are performed. The purpose of the literature study is to identify the state of the art within the research area of effective organizational measures and learning from incident processes. The empirical basis of the document analysis is investigation reports and reports on proposed and implemented measures. The purpose of this empirical part of the thesis is twofold. First, to gather information about effective measures and learning from incident processes from front line personnel. Second, to gather information about the potential for improvement within the industry and within the studied company. One of the key findings of the study was effective organizational measures are formulated as SMARTER actions with clear closing criteria, where the formulation is balanced properly between goal-oriented and prescriptive, and which ensures sustainability provided by a traceability in governing documents or other systems. Furthermore, it was found that the learning from <b>incident</b> <b>process</b> is only effective if all the phases of the process is properly executed. However, involvement of frontline personnel, safety delegates and others was identified as a significant contributor to achieving a successful learning from <b>incident</b> <b>process.</b> Moreover, it was recognized that the studied company (and the industry) needs to do some changes in their practices in the three last phases of the learning from <b>incident</b> <b>process</b> (planning intervention, intervening and the evaluating phase). The implications of the study were identified as of importance not only for the studied company, but also for the industry in order to prevent high-potential incidents, such as gas leaks. The most significant practical implications were recognized as the importance of right involvement of personnel, proper formulation of measures and evaluation of measures and the learning from <b>incident</b> <b>process.</b> In addition, theoretical implications were identified as a need for more research on involving safety delegates in the learning from incident processes, how to avoid negative effects by using KPI systems, and lastly, how to ensure effective learning in shift-organizations...|$|E
40|$|Many {{incidents}} {{have occurred}} because organisations {{have failed to}} learn from lessons of the past.

This paper presents a model that enables organisations to analyse the steps in a learning from <b>incidents</b> <b>process</b> and to identify the bottlenecks.

40|$|The ongoing {{existence}} of workplace accidents suggests that opportunities exist for organisations, regulators {{and other government}} bodies to improve their ability to learn from past events. The processes and outcomes of incident investigations are crucial to understanding the vulnerabilities and opportunities associated with work related incidents and accidents. Many scholarly articles exist that discuss the failure to learn from industrial incidents and <b>incident</b> investigation <b>processes.</b> However, very {{little research has been}} published on practitioner’s views on incident investigations. In this article we begin to address this gap by presenting findings from a survey that gathered practitioners’ perceptions of <b>incident</b> investigation <b>processes.</b> The article begins with a review of existing literature that was used to inform the survey distributed to practitioners. Results from the 222 respondents indicated that most <b>incident</b> investigation <b>processes</b> directed investigators to identify the cause of the incident, and to generate recommendations. Few required mitigation controls and the initiating event (i. e., the hazard) be identified. Even fewer organisations’ <b>incident</b> investigation <b>processes</b> required a description of the incident or sequence of events, the identification of Human Factors issues, or the identification of prevention controls. Feedback from practitioners indicated that current <b>incident</b> investigation <b>processes</b> had certain strengths, and that opportunities existed for further improvement.

30|$|When an {{incident}} occurs, both the traffic operators and travellers {{are concerned about}} how long the <b>incident</b> <b>process</b> will last given that it has already lasted for x minutes, where x[*]≥[*] 0. Thus, {{the length of time}} that elapsed from the beginning of incident detection until the end (i.e., duration time or clearance time) is noteworthy in the traffic incident duration analysis. Table 2 shows that many researchers applied various hazard-based models in their previous studies on traffic incident duration analysis. Most of these models are parametric accelerated failure time (AFT) models, which can determine the significant variables that affect the traffic incident duration time. As shown in Table 2, the distribution of accident durations {{has been found to be}} different per study and is a basic problem in modelling accident duration analysis. The differences may have resulted from several factors, including difference in sample size (from several hundred to tens of thousands of accident records), difference in the quality of accident data, difference in countries, and differences in other factors that affect accident duration.|$|E

40|$|Incident {{analysis}} {{is commonly used}} as a tooi to provide {{information on how to}} improve health and safety in complex work environments. The effectiveness of this tooi, however, depends on how the {{analysis is}} actually carried out. The traditional view on incident analysis highlights the role of human and technical failure in incident causation. More recently, the importance of the organisational factors underlying these human and technical failures has been acknowledged. Furthermore, incident analysis has traditionally focused on the failure side of incident causation, ignoring the potentialof human recovery in minimising the negative outcomes of the <b>incident</b> <b>process.</b> The recent emphasis on organisational failure has not vet resulted in any practical tools for detecting, describing and classifying organisational factors. The study outlined in this chapter presents the development of a taxonomy for classifying the organisational factors underlying incidents. The taxonomy was originally developed in the Dutch steel industry and has subsequently been applied in various settings in the medical domain. The application of the taxonomy in an Anaesthesia department and an Intensive Care Unit are discussed in detail. The analysis of recent incidents within these departments demonstrates both the contribution of organisational failures in incident causation and the contribution of human recovery in preventing minor incidents from developing into major accidents. The chapter concludes with suggestions on how to widen the scope of incident analysis in complex work environments, in order to raise its effectiveness as a tool for improving health and safety...|$|E

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of our ongoing study is to develop {{knowledge}} {{on how to improve}} learning from incidents in organisations. In this phase of the study insight into the main bottlenecks is created. Many organizations investigate accidents and incidents to understand what happened, what caused it and why, and how to learn lessons from them to prevent re-occurrence. No matter how accurate the investigation and analysis are: further steps are necessary to prevent re-occurrence. By learning from incidents, re-occurrence of these incidents and the occurrence of similar events can be prevented and therefore safety performance can be improved. In an earlier phase of the study a model of the learning from <b>incidents</b> <b>process,</b> which is the process from reporting an incident to verifying the effectiveness of remedial measures, is developed.

40|$|Many {{organizations}} try {{to prevent}} reoccurrence of incidents by analyzing incidents and implement recommendations based in their findings. Unfortunately this approach is not without pitfalls. Between 'reporting' and 'evaluation {{of the effect of}} actions' there are several hurdles to be taken. Only by looking at all the steps in the process organizations can 'learn from incidents'. This contrasts with the traditional view that success can be achieved by looking at a limited number of factors, e. g. 'the tool' itself. Furthermore, organizations mistakenly believe that by formally zorganizing each of the steps they take away the hurdles. A checklist was generated aimed at the identification of the hurdles in the learning from <b>incident</b> <b>process.</b> Several hundred safety professionals in the Netherlands and employees in a tank storage company were asked to identify the so called 'bottle-necks' in their own organization and describe if each of the steps has been formally organized and how it worked in practice. Interviews with focus groups were held to identify causes of the hurdles. The learning potential from accidents is reduced, many of the steps in the learning from incidents process have flaws. This cannot be improved by taking one weak link out, only an approach that takes all steps into account can significantly im-prove the learning potential of organizations. Furthermore, the level of formal organizations has little predictive value for the 'real situation'. Learning from incidents is of key importance for organizations to prevent their reoccurrence. This paper will describe the 'learning from incident process', will describe the main hurdles and their causes and will help organizations under-stand why 'Its not the tool' and why formal organization is not sufficient to guarantee success...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to create a {{diagnostic}} process to describe communication within the unique context of student volunteer organizations. A three-part conceptual model was developed to explain communication in volunteer organizations, including the components of information availability, communication structure, and member involvement in organizational communication processes. This model formed the basis for instrument development. The ICA Communication Audit provided the model for a multiple-measures process, which was titled the Student Organization Communication Diagnosis. ^ With the help of a Panel of Experts, the Student Organization Communication Questionnaire was developed. It was administered to student organization members, and factor analysis suggested that the components of the conceptual model were basically upheld in the instrument. Three factors were identified, named organizational and communication involvement, participatory and democratic structure, and information availability. Post hoc analysis of results suggested the possibility of a fourth component to describe communication in volunteer organizations, that of friendship and social relations. This component should be considered in future study. ^ Tests of reliability and validity were conducted, and results suggested that the instrument has acceptable internal consistency, and that two of three factors, organizational and communication involvement, and information availability, show statistical significance in their ability to discriminate between groups of organizations identified as effective and as ineffective. Analysis of respondents 2 ̆ 7 evaluations of the questionnaire provided support for the importance of three needs [...] time, cost, and perceived relevance [...] which were identified as particularly significant for a volunteer organization diagnostic process, and which were also determined as major constraints in the ICA Audit for use in volunteer organizations. ^ Two additional methods, an interview schedule and a critical <b>incident</b> <b>process,</b> were developed. All instruments, instructions, and a results record were organized into the multiple-measures package, entitled the Student Organization Communication Diagnosis. This process is now ready for further refinement, and ultimately should be used in studying the untapped area of communication in volunteer organizations. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{emotional}} experience of leaders (i. e., school principals) who have managed a critical incident involving {{the death of}} a student, teacher or staff member was the focus of the dissertation. Secondary issues of communication, decision making, and interpersonal communication were also explored. A qualitative paradigm using methods of constant comparative analysis (Lincoln & Guba, 1985) embedded within a world view of feminism (Jaggar, 1997), social constructivism (Harre, 1986) and experiential psychology (Greenberg & Safran) identified questions, themes, and understandings. Purposive sampling identified ten participants including three female and seven male principals. Further distinguishing criteria included a separation between public and catholic schools, elementary and senior grades, rural and urban, male and female, and native and non-native. For each participant, two semi-structured interviews of 1 1 / 2 hours each were conducted. Nine themes were deduced from the data and included the principals' emotions, concerns, internal support (the principals' actions and beliefs that helped them cope with the CI), external support (support systems that assisted the principal personally and managerially), caring support (that principals gave to others), strengths, leadership, learning, and advice. The findings revealed that principals typically managed their emotions during a CI by compartmentalizing or pushing their feelings aside; managed the feelings of others by listening, making presence felt by being visible, showing concern, and encouraging participation; became "wiser," and "more understanding;" avoided critical incident training and practice; improved interpersonal communication with the most dramatic increase between principal and counselor; improved relationships with the school community; and were freer to seek support and not have to appear in control both of tasks and emotions when interdependency was acknowledged, which led to more open styles of communication and consultative decision making. Implications for practice point to the need for critical incident and stress management training; compulsory principal's debriefing; formalized system of administrative support during a CI; policy and procedures for CI practice sessions and updating of teams and networks; establishment of susceptibility markers; information and ongoing communication between head office and principals; and, training and education on the concepts of emotional intelligence. Contributions of the research include mapping out of the principals' critical <b>incident</b> <b>process</b> and the accompanying emotional states; explaining the relationship between the themes identified and critical incidents; identifying caring support, communication, and having a critical incident manual as key components for positive CI management. Also, a model of effective critical incident management (ECIM) was developed. As this was an exploratory study, research on the general population of principals is suggested to determine incidence rates, type of incidents, and quality of critical incident management...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} into the role resilience plays {{in the performance of}} managers’ This DBA dissertation, comprising a series of four papers, uses an exploratory, mixed methods design {{to examine the relationship between}} psychological resilience and performance within a cohort of thirty two (32) male and female managers. The study adopted a cross-disciplinary perspective and recognises that whilst there is an extensive body of research on resilience in the clinical and developmental fields, workplace resilience remains relatively unexplored territory among researchers of business management and management practitioners alike. In this study ‘performance’ is understood to be individual and separate from the concepts of productivity and effectiveness either in a job context or as an indicator of career success. The study assesses self-reported manager ‘performance’ on an individual level and in the context of the ‘behaviours’ that may increase or limit performance together with the manager’s learning experience and the development of resilience qualities within the critical <b>incident</b> <b>process.</b> The primary aims of the study are to improve understanding of the importance of resilience and resilient behaviour in the context of workplace performance and as a consequence advance the introduction of the concept of workplace resilience into business management research and everyday practice. Data collection consisted of the completion of a ‘point in time’ individual resilience assessment measure together with a Critical Incident Technique (CIT) based survey questionnaire which was designed specifically to explicate the significance of the recounted critical incidents and to facilitate the respondents’ demonstration (or otherwise) of resilient behaviour. Both instruments were administered via a single, online survey. Survey responses were assessed for resilience using a specially designed and compiled typology of the dimensions of resilient behaviour with numerical values attributed using a ‘Likert’ type scale. This typology represents one of the unique aspects and contributions of this research. Data analysis revealed thematic content related to personal and professional growth, successful and unsuccessful management of challenges or adversity, lessons learned and positive or negative outcomes. Whilst male participant resilience levels were found to be average for the general population with a mean value of 79. 52, female resilience levels were found to be significantly higher at 86. 57. No significant relationships were found in either gender between resilience levels and years of practice or educational level. Overall the study supported the inclusion of resilience and resilient behaviour as important components of increased performance in managers. The results demonstrate that higher levels of resilient behaviour are strongly associated with better management of challenges and adversity (critical incidents) whereas lower levels of resilient behaviour are associated with poor management of critical incidents; and that the degree of success with which a participant managed their respective critical incidents directly impacted their performance in the workplace. This new contextual approach, now grounded in participant data, advances a relatively new perspective to conventional management theories regarding performance in the workplace. The study also makes a novel and timely contribution by introducing the construct of workplace resilience into a specific management context...|$|E
