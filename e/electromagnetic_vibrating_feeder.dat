50|$|The main subprocesses of sensor-based sorting are {{material}} conditioning, material presentation, detection, {{data processing}} and separation. Material conditioning includes all operations which prepare the particles for being detected by the sensor. All optical sensors need clean material {{to be able}} to detect optical characteristics. Conditioning includes screening and cleaning of the feed material. The aim of the material presentation is the isolation of the particles by creating a single particle layer with the densest surface cover possible without particles touching each other and enough distance to each other allowing for a selective detection and rejection of each single particle. There are two types of sensor-based sorters: the chute type and the belt type. For both types the first step in acceleration is spreading out the particles by a <b>vibrating</b> <b>feeder</b> followed by either a fast belt or a chute. On the belt type the sensor usually detects the particles horizontally while they pass it on the belt. For the chute type the material detection is usually done vertically while the material passes the sensor in a free fall. The data processing is done in real time by a computer. The computer transfers the result of the data processing to an ultra fast ejection unit which, depending on the sorting decision, ejects a particle or lets it pass.|$|R

Additionally, such high frequencies virtually eliminates the stroboscopic effect which is very noticeable in those cases when tubes are powered by means of low frequency alternating or pulsating currents as happens when regular 50 or 60 Hz AC mains are used as power source. Transistorized devices are also silent, unlike true Ruhmkorff coils, which make its characteristic buzzing noises when in action, even if they are contained in closed casings or boxes. Indeed, the principle of modern fluorescent portable lamps or lanterns remains the same as in Dumas and Benoit's original mining electric lamp.|$|R

30|$|The {{feed bin}} <b>vibrating</b> <b>feeder</b> {{controls}} the feed rate to the separating table. As ROM coal is {{introduced to the}} separation zone, a thick bed of particles forms on the vibrating deck. The heavier or high-density particles transport through the bed, comes {{in contact with the}} deck, and move toward the back plate {{under the influence of the}} inertia force generated due to deck vibration. Particles when strike the back plate, they move inward and upward in the direction of the discharge side of the table. During operation, lighter or low-density particles float on the top of the bed as they are pushed up at the back plate, and flow to the discharge point. As such, the lighter particles create an upper layer that is collected alongside the deck length. Particles of sufficient high-density sinks through the autogenous medium formed due to the bed of particles fluidized due to constant air-flow, and report back to the deck surface. These high-density particles are then forced by both vibration and the continuous influx of new feed material to transport in a helical pattern at the narrow end of the deck where the final reject is collected. Two or three products are collected from the front side of the table. For pilot-scale evaluation, a 5 -tph air-table deshaling unit utilizing a 1  m 2 air table was tested at three different test sites in India. An immanent advantage of this technology is that it is a dry separator, which delivers a dry product without incurring any dewatering costs.|$|R

3000|$|One {{principal}} {{result of}} the whole coma aperture-averaged polarimetry of comets concerns the negative polarization branch (NPB) at small phase angles α (α ≤ 20 – 22 °).

Thus, negative polarization simply implies Iǁ < I⊥ near the backscattering regime. The average shape of the NPB is quite symmetric, so the minimum of the negative polarization Pmin, typically ≈ – 1.7 %, is observed at αmin ≈ 10 – 11 ° (e.g., Chernova et al, 1993; Levasseur-Regourd et al., 1996).

The density {{matrix of}} a spin s is fixed uniquely if the probabilites {{to obtain the}} value s upon {{measuring}} En Es are known for 4 s. s + 1 / appropriately chosen directions En in space. These numbers are just the expectation values of the density operator in coherent spin states, and they are easily obtained in an experiment carried out with a Stern–Gerlach apparatus. Furthermore, the experimental data is non-redundant, {{and it can be}} inverted explicitly which allows for a parametrization of the statistical operator by the 4 s. s + 1 / positive parameters. If an infinite ensemble of identically prepared quantum systems is available, the rules of quantum mechanics allow one to extract complete information about the quantum state. The required inversion, expressing the statistical operator entirely in terms of measurable quantities, is not straightforward from a mathematical point of view, and the data acquisition in the laboratory is challenging since it is necessary to deal reliably with individual quantum systems. The experimental verification of a state reconstruction scheme requires high standards in the preparation of individual quantum systems.

While the first {{is close to the}} scene or immersed in it, possessing a direct interaction with the represented reality, the second is derived using data collected by automatic sensors placed on satellite platforms (Landsat ETM+ 7), orbiting with a polar, sun-synchronous orbit at 705, 000 meters of altitude. Consequently, the data is collected automatically from far away¿remotely sensed¿and without any interaction between the sensor, or who is pointing the sensor, and the recorded reality. The satellite sensor collects information about the quantity of electromagnetic energy emitted by the sun and then reflected, or directly emitted by each point of the scanned terrestrial surface. <b>Electromagnetic</b> energy means <b>vibrating</b> energy; the information on the quantity of energy collected by the satellite sensor is then subdivided by ¿type¿ of energy, using as a criterion the frequency of vibration. The sensor exploited in this work subdivides the energy in seven parts or ¿bands,¿ from the highest to the slowest vibration frequency (also called ¿spectral¿ information); we have the blue, green, and red portionparts of the visible spectrum, and then four bands in the infrared portionpart, until the slow vibration of the last infrared band, measuring the thermal energy emitted by the ground. It is important to understand that the whole system mentioned above, composed of orbiting satellite platform, sensor for data collection, transmission of data to the ground stations, and data storage and retrieval, can be considered almost automatic. Very little human intervention is needed during the normal operating conditions of this system, and human decision is required (almost) only in case of unexpected events producing failures in some of the system components. In brief, we have a remote, automatic machine, flying in space and sensing the ground surface, registering and storing the data on the reflected/emitted quantity of energy subdivided by vibration frequency. This data registration activity is automatic and completely indifferent to the scene registered. The data collected by the sensor forms a kind of stripe or scan following the trace of the satellite orbit on the ground, and then we can then mosaic these stripes and make a seamless representation of the terrestrial surface. This is what we call ¿remote sensing data,¿ and it is the raw material used in the present work. JRC. G. 2 -Global security and crisis managemen...|$|R
