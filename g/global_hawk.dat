5|$|In 2015, a {{group that}} claims {{affiliation}} with Anonymous group, calling themselves as AnonSec, claimed to have hacked and gathered almost 276 GB of data from NASA servers including NASA flight and radar logs and videos, and also multiple documents related to ongoing research. AnonSec group also claimed gaining access of a <b>Global</b> <b>Hawk</b> Drone of NASA, and released some video footage purportedly from the drone's cameras. A part of the data was released by AnonSec on Pastebin service, as an Anon Zine. NASA has denied the hack, asserting that {{the control of the}} drones were never compromised, but has acknowledged that the photos released along with the content are real photographs of its employees, but that most of these data are already available in the public domain.|$|E

50|$|In December 2007, two <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks</b> were {{transferred}} from the U.S. Air Force to NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base. Initial research activities beginning {{in the second quarter}} of 2009 supported NASA's high-altitude, long-duration Earth science missions. The two <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks</b> were the first and sixth aircraft built under the original DARPA Advanced Concept Technology Demonstration program, and were made available to NASA when the Air Force had no further need for them. Northrop Grumman is an operational partner with NASA and will use the aircraft to demonstrate new technologies and to develop new markets for the aircraft, including possible civilian uses.|$|R
50|$|In 2011, South Korea's Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) {{expressed}} interest in acquiring at least four RQ-4Bs to increase intelligence capabilities following the exchange of the Wartime Operational Control from the U.S. to the Republic of Korea. Officials debated {{on the topic of}} the <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks</b> and domestic UAV programs. In September 2011, the US and South Korea discussed aircraft deployments near its land border to view North Korea and the North Korea-China border. In January 2012, DAPA announced that it would not proceed with a purchase due to a price rise from US$442M to US$899M, and that other platforms such as the Global Observer or the Phantom Eye were being investigated. However, in December 2012, South Korea notified Congress of a possible Foreign Military Sale of 4 RQ-4 Block 30 (I) <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks</b> with the Enhanced Integrated Sensor Suite (EISS) at an estimated cost of $1.2 billion. On 5 July 2013, the Korean National Assembly advised the government to re-evaluate the RQ-4 purchase, again citing high costs. On 17 December 2014, Northrop Grumman was awarded a $657 million contract by South Korea for four RQ-4B Block 30 <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks,</b> the first pair to be delivered in 2018 and the second pair in 2019.|$|R

50|$|Engineering {{work was}} {{completed}} at the Northrop Grumman Unmanned Systems Development Center in Rancho Bernardo, California. Pilots from NASA, NOAA, and Northrop Grumman flew the <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks</b> from the NASA Armstrong Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base, also in California. Sargent Fletcher Inc. and Sierra Nevada Corporation were major KQ-X subcontractors.|$|R
50|$|According to {{an article}} in the March 2010 issue of Scientific American (p. 25-27), NASA's <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks</b> were {{expected}} to begin scientific missions that month, and had been undergoing tests in late 2009, with. Initial science applications included measurements of the ozone layer and cross-Pacific transport of air pollutants and aerosols; the author of the Scientific American piece speculates that it could be used for Antarctic exploration while being based in Chile. In August-September 2010, one of the two <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks</b> was loaned for NASA's GRIP Mission (Genesis and Rapid Intensification Program). Its long-term on station capabilities and long range made it a suitable aircraft for monitoring the development of Atlantic basin Hurricanes. It was modified to equip weather sensors including Ku-band radar, lightning sensors and dropsondes. It successfully flew into Hurricane Earl off the United States East Coast on 2 September 2010.|$|R
25|$|A {{new group}} of {{research}} projects came to Edwards in the 1990s. <b>Global</b> <b>Hawk,</b> an unmanned aerial vehicle {{that has been used}} extensively in Afghanistan and Iraq, made its first flight at Edwards in February 1998. The X-24, X-33, X-34, X-36 and X-38, a series of new lifting bodies, technology demonstrators and half-scale models were tested here by NASA during the decade.|$|E
25|$|The 1st Reconnaissance Squadron is {{responsible}} for training all High-Altitude Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance aircrew for the U-2S Dragon Lady and the RQ-4 <b>Global</b> <b>Hawk.</b> Aircrew members consist of pilots and mission planners for the U-2S, and pilots and sensor operators for the RQ-4. Training for all U-2S pilots includes additional qualification in the T-38A Talon, the companion trainer to the U-2S.|$|E
25|$|The 12th Reconnaissance Squadron {{plans and}} executes {{worldwide}} high-altitude combat surveillance and reconnaissance missions including peacetime intelligence gathering, contingency operations and conventional warfare. Operating the RQ-4B <b>Global</b> <b>Hawk</b> Remotely Piloted Aircraft (RPA), the 12 RS provides signals intelligence and near real-time imagery intelligence to fulfill operational requirements {{generated by the}} Joint Chiefs of Staff {{in support of the}} Secretary of Defense and unified commanders.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Global</b> <b>Hawk's</b> {{system is}} the first to be flight tested, a program for which Northrop Grumman is using its Proteus {{aircraft}} (built by Scaled Composites). The MP-RTIP is mounted in a large pod fitted under Proteus. The program, jointly conducted by Northrop-Grumman and the Air Force's 851st Electronic Systems Group, is being operated from the Mojave Spaceport.|$|R
50|$|The KQ-X program {{ended in}} September 2012 without {{airborne}} fuel transfer occurring {{between the two}} UAVs. The two <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks</b> used in demonstrations were owned by NASA and jointly operated with Northrop Grumman. NASA required the two planes for atmospheric science missions in June 2012 after flight control testing and had to de-modify and reconfigure them to perform hurricane tracking flights after that. Further tests could have been performed, but NASA halted {{the use of the}} <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks</b> that June after a Navy operated version crashed. The May 30 flight was the ninth and final test of the program, with the two aircraft flying close at 44,800 ft to measure aerodynamic and control interactions. Data from the flights were put into virtual simulations that concluded 60 percent of autonomous refueling attempts would result in contact between the refueling probe and receiver drogue. Further unmanned refueling tests were carried out under the Unmanned Combat Air System Demonstrator program with software from the Northrop Grumman X-47B UAV.|$|R
50|$|Northrop Grumman {{retrofitted}} {{two of the}} HALE UAVs so {{that one}} aircraft can pump fuel into the other while in flight via a hose-and-drogue refueling system. Several aspects of the KQ-X program were considered revolutionary: not only would the aerial refueling be autonomous, but since <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks</b> are classified as HALE UAVs, the refueling tests would occur at an altitude higher than that typically performed using manned aircraft. The tests would also {{be the first time}} that HALE UAVs have been flown in formation.|$|R
25|$|The new {{millennium}} brought new projects with worldwide impact. The X-35A and X-32A, competing {{models for the}} Joint Strike Fighter program, made their first flights in September and October 2000. The X-35A won the competition in 2001 and will eventually be built in various versions for America's flying armed services and for foreign air forces as well. Also new are the RQ-4 <b>Global</b> <b>Hawk,</b> YAL-1 Airborne Laser, the B-52 synthetic fuel program, the C-17 Globemaster III, and many prototype unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs).|$|E
25|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 21st century, subsonic military aviation focused on eliminating the pilot in favor of remotely operated or completely autonomous vehicles. Several unmanned aerial vehicles or UAVs have been developed. In April 2001 the unmanned aircraft <b>Global</b> <b>Hawk</b> flew from Edwards AFB in the US to Australia non-stop and unrefuelled. This is the longest point-to-point flight ever undertaken by an unmanned aircraft, and took 23 hours and 23 minutes. In October 2003 the first totally autonomous flight across the Atlantic by a computer-controlled model aircraft occurred. Major disruptions to air travel in the 21st Century included the closing of U.S. airspace following the September 11 attacks, and the closing of northern European airspace after the 2010 eruptions of EyjafjallajÃ¶kull.|$|E
25|$|In August 2015, the 60th-year {{anniversary of}} the U-2 program, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works {{revealed}} they were internally developing a successor to the U-2, {{referred to as the}} UQ-2 or RQ-X, combining features from both the manned U-2 and unmanned Northrop Grumman RQ-4 <b>Global</b> <b>Hawk</b> and improving upon them. Disclosed details say the design is essentially an improved U-2 airframe with the same engine, service ceiling, sensors, and cockpit, with the main differences being an optional manning capability (something Lockheed has proposed for the U-2 to the Air Force several times but has never gained traction) and low-observable characteristics. The Air Force has no requirement or timeframe for a next-generation High-Altitude Long Endurance (HALE) platform, but Lockheed sees a future need and wants something in development early. Having the option of an onboard pilot is considered a deterrent because it can be used in peacetime situations where unmanned aircraft would more likely be engaged, since there is no possibility of killing a person. The company's last attempt to create a stealth unmanned aircraft was the RQ-3 DarkStar, which never made it past flight testing and was canceled. Plans for a U-2 replacement would not conflict with development of the SR-72, another project by the company to create a hypersonic unmanned surveillance plane, as it would be suited for missions that require greater speed for time-sensitive targets.|$|E
5000|$|In 2010 the UK government's Strategic Defence and Security Review {{announced}} {{its intention to}} [...] "withdraw the Sentinel airborne ground surveillance aircraft once {{it is no longer}} required to support operations in Afghanistan." [...] Sentinel has supported the British Army in Afghanistan. Its role above Libya in 2011 was described as [...] "pivotal" [...] by the head of the RAF. In February 2012 it was announced that Sentinel would be offered as the UK contribution to NATO's Alliance Ground Surveillance (AGS) collaboration, complementing NATO RQ-4 <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks</b> and French Heron TPs.|$|R
50|$|In November 2015, Northrop Grumman {{selected}} the Garmin International GSX 70 weather radar {{to be installed}} on Air Force <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks.</b> The GSX 70 {{is designed to provide}} operators with real-time weather information, offering horizontal scan angles of up to 120 degrees for better visibility into the strength and intensity of convective activity and a vertical scanning mode to analyze storm tops, gradients, and cell buildup activity. It also has a Turbulence Detection feature to identify turbulence in air containing precipitation and other airborne particulates and Ground Clutter Suppression that removes ground returns from the display so operators can focus on weather. Installation is expected to begin in early 2016.|$|R
50|$|Flight demonstrations {{occurred}} from January 11, 2012 to May 30. In these demonstrations, {{the aircraft}} extended and retracted the refueling hose, demonstrated precision control in formation with manual and automated breakaway maneuvers, flew in formation {{as close as}} 30 ft, and autonomously flew in close formation for over 2.5 hours under autonomous control within 100 ft (one wingspan) of each other. In a departure from traditional refueling methods, the tanker is fitted with a refueling probe on the nose, which trails behind the receiving aircraft equipped with a hose-drum unit under the fuselage, plugging into the drogue and pushing the fuel upwards. Autonomous aerial refueling was expected to extend the <b>Global</b> <b>Hawk's</b> endurance from 30-35 hours to 120-125 hours, set by payload reliability more than engine oil consumption.|$|R

50|$|On 14 July 2015, Northrop Grumman and the USAF {{signed an}} {{agreement}} to demonstrate an RQ-4B fitted with the U-2's OBC and SYERS-2C sensors; two <b>Global</b> <b>Hawks</b> are to be fitted with the UPA, involving the installation of 17 payload adapter fixtures and a new payload bay cover, as well as software and mission system changes for each sensor. The UPA can support 1,200 lb of sensors and will create a canoe-shaped sensor bay on the fuselage's underside. The RQ-4's ability to operate these sensors will likely influence the U-2's planned retirement by 2019. In addition, Northrop also expects to receive a contract to integrate the UTC Aerospace Systems MS-177 mulitspectral sensor used on the E-8C JSTARS onto the RQ-4; the MS-177 will replace the SYERS-2 and includes modernized optronics and a gimbaled rotation device to increase field of view by 20 percent.
