Andrew locates Samantha in a Mexican hospital and the pair board a train, until learning the tracks ahead have been damaged. They discover that if they do not leave the country within a few days, sea and air travel will be blocked for six months. Andrew and Samantha decide to <b>hitchhike</b> their way to the coast.|$|E
5|$|Born in Versailles, Kentucky, to a Southern white minister, Parrish spent {{parts of}} his youth living in Alabama and Georgia. His birthplace is often listed as being in nearby Lexington, Kentucky. He {{graduated}} from Cullman High School, Cullman, Alabama in 1924 and Rice Institute, Houston, Texas in 1928. He dropped out of graduate school after one year and decided to <b>hitchhike</b> to San Francisco. The lack of work meant hunger, so he chose to join the United States Army's 11th Cavalry Regiment as a private on July 30, 1930, serving in Monterey, California.|$|E

Stewie becomes frustrated and continues to attempt to <b>hitchhike,</b> corecing Brian to join him. The pair then encounter a Canadian who gives them his snowmobile.|$|E
40|$|Andrea McGuire is {{completing}} her MA degree in Folklore at Memorial University. She {{is currently in}} the throes of writing her master’s thesis on <b>hitchhiking</b> traditions in Newfoundland and Cape Breton. In her thesis, she is looking at how trust, in its many variations, influences the way <b>hitchhiking</b> is practiced, and the way <b>hitchhiking</b> stories are told.  We discuss why Andrea chose <b>hitchhiking</b> for her thesis, how she conducted her research, the difference between short and long distance <b>hitchhiking,</b> how gender effects <b>hitchhiking,</b> the stories people tell and the techniques they use, the brief history of <b>hitchhiking</b> in Newfoundland, and examples of the <b>hitchhiking</b> stories she has heard...|$|R
40|$|Genetic <b>hitchhiking</b> {{occurs when}} alleles at unselected loci are changed in {{frequency}} {{because of an}} association with alleles at a selected locus. This association may be mediated either by linkage or partial selfing (inbreeding) and can affect the gene frequency and gametic disequilibrium at the neutral loci. <b>Hitchhiking</b> from partial selfing (unlinked loci) occurs more quickly than linkage <b>hitchhiking</b> and generally has a greater effect. In addition, partial-selfing <b>hitchhiking</b> can cause increases or changes in sign in gametic disequilibrium between neutral loci. The effects of {{the two types of}} <b>hitchhiking</b> with different levels of dominance, zygotic frequencies and number of selected loci are also examined. The general conditions for linkage and partial-selfing <b>hitchhiking</b> are outlined and the implications of <b>hitchhiking</b> are discussed for marker or electrophoretic loci...|$|R

5|$|As a result, Azamat {{abandons}} Borat, {{taking his}} passport, {{all of their}} money, and their bear (whose head is later seen inside Azamat's motel refrigerator). Borat's truck runs out of gas, and he begins to <b>hitchhike</b> to California. He is soon picked up by drunken fraternity brothers from the University of South Carolina. On learning {{the reason for his}} trip, they show him the Pam and Tommy sex tape, revealing that she is not the virgin he thought she was. After leaving the three students, Borat becomes despondent, burning the Baywatch booklet and, by mistake, his return ticket to Kazakhstan. He is also about to slaughter his pet hen, but then changes his mind and lets it go.|$|E

30|$|To summarize, <b>hitchhiking</b> is {{considered}} as a compound of travelling, ridesharing, adventure and cultural exchange, which makes it interesting to study. It is shown that success of <b>hitchhiking</b> is related to many factors, including social, gender, cultural aspects, which are widely studied earlier. However, spatial and computational aspects of <b>hitchhiking</b> have not been studied before {{to the best of}} our knowledge, and this paper aims to fill this gap. In the “Methodology” section, a few descriptions of good <b>hitchhiking</b> locations will be presented.|$|R
30|$|As a {{goodwill}} exchange, <b>hitchhiking</b> promotes {{values for}} sharing cost and helping unknown people. It facilitates friendship among various {{people from different}} cultural backgrounds. Since <b>hitchhiking</b> involves uncertain and spontaneous travels, it is usually considered an adventurous way of travelling. In addition, {{it can be done}} on any road with traffic. Even though personal safety is a common concern about this type of travel, surveys show that only 1 % of people who <b>hitchhiked</b> report negative experience of <b>hitchhiking</b> [2].|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to chart the {{acceptance}} of <b>hitchhiking</b> in American culture from the Depression through Ronald Reagan 2 ̆ 7 s two terms in office and explore the reasons for the decline of the practice. I argue that views of <b>hitchhiking</b> in American culture are more dependent upon the economic and political climates of a particular time period than any real connection to the actual level of violence. There was always violence associated with <b>hitchhiking,</b> but different time periods understood these violent acts in different ways. I suggest these alternative ways of perceiving the safety of <b>hitchhiking</b> were informed by national attitudes toward collectivism and individualism. Moreover, the economic and political climates of a time period dictate the values associated with <b>hitchhiking,</b> specifically in terms of the necessity and perceived romance of the practice, and how these values shape the acceptance of <b>hitchhiking</b> in the United States...|$|R

25|$|Workers of the {{tropical}} leafcutter ant bringing leaf fragments back to the nest {{are at risk of}} attack by parasitodic phorid flies, who often land on leaf fragments and then proceed to oviposit (egg-lay) into the ant's head. To help combat this, small workers (minims) in at least seven species of Atta <b>hitchhike</b> on the leaves, deterring parasitioid attack. Many possible additional functions of hitchhiking have been proposed, some pertinent to social immunity; evidence exists that the primary function of hitchhiking minims' is actually to inspect and clean the leaf fragments prior to their entry into the colony, removing microbial parasites and contaminants.|$|E
25|$|Sony Japan, however, only {{releases}} Shimabukuro's {{music in}} Japan, and {{to release the}} music in Hawaii, he created the <b>Hitchhike</b> Records label. Between 2002 and 2005, Shimabukuro released four U.S. albums as a solo performer: Sunday Morning (2002), Crosscurrent (2003), Walking Down Rainhill (2004), and Dragon (2005). All of them except Dragon won both Na Hoku Awards and Hawaii Music Awards, and Dragon won the Hawaii Music Award for Best Rock Album and peaked at #5 on Billboards Top World Music Albums in 2005. As a solo artist, Shimabukuro experimented with using effect pedals to make new sounds that few would associate with an ukulele.|$|E

25|$|The body of 28-year-old Lisa Nichols, {{who also}} used the last name of Jarvis, was found on September 16, 1984 along Interstate 40 near West Memphis, Arkansas. She was a {{resident}} of West Virginia and authorities {{were not able to}} come into contact with family members for some time, indicating she was estranged from them, resulting in her remaining unidentified for nearly a year. Her body was not identified until June 1985, nine months after she was strangled and left wearing only a sweater. Nichols is believed {{to be a part of}} the Redhead Murders, as she was found along a highway and had strawberry-blond hair at the time of her demise. Her remains were identified by a couple from Florida, who had allowed her to stay with them for a period of time. Nichols may have been murdered after leaving a truck stop along the highway and may have attempted to <b>hitchhike.</b>|$|E
25|$|Born in Chicago, Ralph Martin Goldberg {{was eight}} years old when his family moved to Brooklyn, and started using the name Ralph G. Martin at an early age. He studied at City College of New York and, subsequently, University of Missouri from which he {{graduated}} in 1941 with a bachelor's degree in journalism. Twenty-one years old upon receiving his diploma, he decided to <b>hitchhike</b> and found a newspaper job at Box Elder News Journal which served Brigham City, the county seat of Utah's Box Elder County. In December, following declaration of war in the aftermath of attack on Pearl Harbor, Martin enlisted in the Army and spent the war as a combat correspondent for the Armed Forces newspaper Stars and Stripes and the Army weekly magazine, Yank. In 1944, having interviewed New York City's mayor, Fiorello La Guardia, for Yank, Martin asked La Guardia to perform his marriage ceremony to Marjorie Pastel.|$|E
25|$|Lori Lee Kursa, 13, a Lawrence Cook Middle School student, {{had been}} {{reported}} missing by her mother on November 11, 1972 after disappearing while they shopped at a U-Save and was last seen on November 20 or 21 in Santa Rosa while visiting friends, having deliberately run away. She had been known to <b>hitchhike</b> occasionally. Her frozen remains were located on December 14 in a ravine approximately fifty feet off Calistoga Road, northeast of Rincon Valley in Santa Rosa. The killer had thrown the body at least thirty feet over an embankment. The cause of her death was a broken neck with compression and hemorrhage of the spinal cord. The victim had not been raped and likely died one to two weeks prior to discovery. A possible witness to her abduction later came forward stating that on an evening somewhere between December 3 and 9, while on Parkhurst Drive he saw two men push a girl fitting Kursa's description {{into the back of}} a van driven by a Caucasian man with an Afro-type hairstyle. The vehicle then sped north on Calistoga Road.|$|E
30|$|<b>Hitchhiking</b> is a {{well-known}} form of transportation, which has been extensively studied from a sociological perspective.

50|$|Today, <b>hitchhiking</b> {{is legal}} in 44 of the 50 states, {{provided}} that the hitchhiker is not standing in the roadway or otherwise hindering the normal flow of traffic. Even in states where <b>hitchhiking</b> is illegal, hitchhikers are rarely ticketed.

40|$|We study {{levels of}} X-linked vs. {{autosomal}} diversity using a model developed {{to analyze the}} <b>hitchhiking</b> effect. Repeated bouts of <b>hitchhiking</b> are thought to lower X-linked diversity for two reasons: first, because sojourn times of beneficial mutations are shorter on the X, and second, because adaptive substitutions may be more frequent on the X. We investigate whether each of these effects does, in fact, cause reduced X-linked diversity under <b>hitchhiking.</b> We study {{the strength of the}} <b>hitchhiking</b> effect on the X vs. autosomes when there is no recombination and under two different recombination schemes. When recombination occurs in both sexes, X-linked vs. autosomal diversity is reduced by <b>hitchhiking</b> under a broad range of conditions, but when there is no recombination in males, as in Drosophila, the required conditions are considerably more restrictive...|$|R
25|$|Two {{months after}} the murder of Thomas Lundgren, on August 4, 1979, Bonin and Butts {{abducted}} a 17-year-old named Mark Shelton shortly after the youth left his Westminster home to walk to a movie theater near Beach Boulevard. Screams were heard from {{the vicinity of the}} Shelton household by neighbors, leaving a strong possibility Shelton was abducted by force. The youth was violated with foreign objects including a pool cue, causing his body to enter a state of shock which proved fatal. His body was then discarded in San Bernardino County. The following day, Bonin and Butts encountered a 17-year-old West German student named Markus Grabs attempting to <b>hitchhike</b> from Pacific Coast Highway. Grabs was bound with lengths of cord and ignition wire and driven to Bonin's home where he was sodomized, beaten, and stabbed a total of 77 times before his nude body was discarded in Malibu Creek, close to Las Virgenes Canyon Road. His body was found the following morning, with one investigator likening the network of injuries inflicted upon the victim to that of a rabid dog unable to determine when to cease biting.|$|E
25|$|Later, {{the scandal}} behind P.J. {{is that in}} order to receive his trust fund he must marry before he turns 28 years old, and so he proposes to Naomi, unbeknownst to her. Annie finds out about the clause and tells P.J. to come clean to Naomi, which he is about to but {{chickens}} out and ask if she will take his last name instead of saying what he should have. Annie and the girls are with Naomi at a wedding dress store and Annie tells Naomi about P.J's secret. As Naomi learns the truth, she breaks off the engagement. While Dixon is away, Austin returns to town and suggests that Adrianna should start a country music career with his help. Adrianna accepts his offer. But as Austin becomes her manager, he also has his eyes set on steering Adrianna away from Dixon. Navid also returns and reveals that he wants to resume his relationship with Silver, who has found out she has the cancer gene. This causes a dramatic turn, as both Liam and Navid want to be with Silver. A fight breaks out between Liam and Navid during the premiere of Liam's new movie. As a result, Silver decides to side with Navid. Meanwhile, Naomi is the event planner for a young woman named Madison who is enthused by her upcoming nuptials. Naomi gets the shock of her life when she learns that the groom-to-be is none other than Max, her ex-boyfriend. At the bachelor party Max questions Naomi, asking her if he is doing the right thing, and before she can reply is interrupted by Max's fiancée. During the rehearsal wedding, Holly's mother offers Naomi a job offer that she cannot refuse. Naomi takes the offer, but at the airport is talked out of it by Austin because she is still in love with Max. As the wedding of Madison and Max begins, Naomi abruptly interrupts the services and confesses her love for Max. Elsewhere, Ivy is seen going off to Mexico to be with Diego, who was deported because he was an illegal immigrant in the U.S., and only ask for a one-way ticket. Diego and Ivy had begun dating and Diego had helped cease the pain she had been feeling after Raj's death. Diego was arrested for illegal graffiti, and that is why he was being deported. Annie and Caleb break off their relationship because Caleb cannot leave the covenant for Annie; nor does she think he should. Navid reveals that he isn't ready to have a baby, which causes Silver to dump him. She still wants to conceive a child and proposes to have a baby...with Teddy. At {{the very end of the}} season finale, Adrianna is boarding a plane to Las Vegas to kickstart her country music career because Dixon has not returned on time from the tour, but little does she know the car broke down and he had to <b>hitchhike.</b> As Dixon is on the phone with Navid telling him to stop Adrianna, a truck hits Dixon's car and it is left unknown if Dixon is still alive.|$|E

30|$|The Hitchwiki dataset itself lacks {{information}} about {{some details of}} <b>hitchhiking</b> travel experience, most importantly the time and destination of trips. <b>Hitchhiking</b> at daytime and night may be completely different, as well as asking a short ride may always imply less waiting time than finding a driver for a long-distance trip. However, even without these parameters, we answered the stated questions and identified the best locations for <b>hitchhiking.</b>|$|R
30|$|Even {{though there}} are several factors for a {{successful}} <b>hitchhiking</b> ride, the location is considered {{the most important factor}} for a successful ride [3]. Certain location properties make it easier for drivers to stop and have enough traffic to increase the probability of a successful ride for a hitchhiker. A good location is determined by two main factors: a short average waiting time for catching a ride to the desired destination, and a small probability of an unusually long ride. Therefore, the choice of a <b>hitchhiking</b> location is crucial for a successful <b>hitchhiking</b> trip. This paper is the first one to identify these factors by analysing <b>hitchhiking</b> logs.|$|R
