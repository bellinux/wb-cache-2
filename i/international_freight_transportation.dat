Many have to manage their upstream and downstream supply chain for procurement and sale, where different kinds of materials/parts and products are distributed with different requirements on transportation cost and lead-time. It is thus desirable to ensure operational efficiency in not only in international land but also inter-model transportation. This includes maritime transportation which will have the largest modal share.

40|$|Excerpt] After a {{prolonged}} slump, the U. S. manufacturing sector is showing notable signs of revival. In part, the upturn in manufacturing output is cyclical, as global economic growth recovers following the downturn in 2008 - 2009. At the same time, however, {{there are indications}} that other forces may be contributing to the revival of U. S. manufacturing. Higher labor costs in the emerging economies of Asia, higher <b>international</b> <b>freight</b> <b>transportation</b> costs, and heightened concern about the risk of disruptions to long, complex supply chains all increase the relative attractiveness of the United States as a location for factory production. In public discourse, the revival of manufacturing is often associated with a variety of policy objectives, particularly with respect to employment. Most notably, proponents of support for the manufacturing sector often associate increased manufacturing activity with the creation of jobs for workers without higher education. Evidence suggests, however, that even strong growth in manufacturing output could well have only modest impact on job creation, and is unlikely to reverse the declining demand for workers with low levels of education...|$|E
40|$|This study {{provides}} {{an approach to}} measuring the local economic costs stemming from delays on bridges connecting the U. S. and Canada. We focused {{on two of the}} busiest bridges in the U. S. and Canada that connect the Buffalo–Niagara metropolitan region and Ontario province, using an approach that combines spatial networks and local economic impact models to estimate the economic costs of border delays on the local economies of the border regions. We estimated that the local economic impacts of delays on the Canada–U. S. border bridges in the range of $ 36, 000 to $ 110, 000 per day in total, indicating that a 1 percent increase of delay cost can produce 1. 33 percent economic costs in total at the bridge connecting Buffalo and Ontario. Furthermore, the binational economic model provides information on which industries are most impacted from shipping delays on the bridges via supply chain, based on various scenarios. Our modeling approach and scenario development process have important implications for border-traffic planning analysis and border-city economies because they allow numerous simulation tests with respect to changes of <b>international</b> <b>freight</b> <b>transportation</b> costs and patterns for key economic sectors...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, {{container}} transport {{is of great}} importance in <b>international</b> marine <b>freight</b> <b>transportation.</b> It is crucial for container terminals to reduce the ship loading (unloading) time {{from the perspective of}} ship waiting times and terminal utilization. The container pre-marshalling problem is to arrange containers on the yard so that they will be loaded by quay cranes into ships efficiently. This paper deals with a special container pre-marshalling problem; i. e., we develop a marshalling plan to avoid conflicts caused by quay cranes requiring containers in the same lane at the same time. The problem is formulated as an integer optimization model, and a two-step heuristic optimization algorithm is presented. Computational experiments are conducted on actual data of a container terminal in Japan. Computational results demonstrate that our method finds better marshalling plans than those of the current system of the container terminal within a reasonable length of time...|$|R
40|$|In {{the last}} four decades the {{container}} as an essential part of a unit-load-concept has scored a great success in <b>international</b> sea <b>freight</b> <b>transportation.</b> Today over 60 % of the worlds deep-sea general cargo is shipped by containers. With the increasing containerization also the number of seaport container terminals and the competition increases considerably. Besides some other factors the success of a seaport container terminal is related to the time in port for container vessels and the transshipment rates the ship operators have to pay. In this paper we describe the main logistics processes in seaport container terminals and present methods for their optimization. We focus on the process of container transport by gantry cranes and straddle carriers between the container vessel and the container yard. The primary objective is the reduction of the time in port for the vessels by maximizing the productivity of the gantry cranes, or in other words, minimizing the delay times of [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{offshoring}} {{process is}} the result of the fragmentation of production processes and the creation of global supply chains. This process has increased final and intermediate imports, but also the distance that goods travel in different stages until they reach the final consumer, as well as the requirements of transport per unit of output and the volume of CO 2 emissions generated in transporting them. Nowadays, there is no generally accepted criterion for international transport pollution allocation. No single country has the responsibility for emissions of international bunkers provided by IPCC. In this paper we propose a new methodology for quantifying by sector the impact of international freight transport on total pollution and assigning responsibility to consumers. This methodology considers the distance and the means of transport as key elements and uses input-output methodology. We apply this to the Spanish economy combining data from input-output tables, import data, and CO 2 emission data. The results show that the proportion of total CO 2 emissions accounted for by emissions from <b>international</b> <b>freight</b> <b>transportation,</b> allocated via the consumer criterion, increase up to 4. 16 % between 1995 and 2000. As expected, the industries where this offshoring process is more intense show the greatest increases in carbon emissions related to international transport. These emissions are significantly higher than emissions embodied in domestic inputs in some of those industries where international fragmentation of production is relevant and increasing.

Some researchers add dummy variables to this model in order to incorporate the spatial effect of a common border as well as of a common language. The consideration of the common border is a key variable in the process of trade between two countries needs to be explored in more detail as an enormous variety of specifications can be applied to address the same spatial issue (see for example Anselin [1]).|$|R

30|$|In literature, {{very few}} works have been {{developed}} for <b>freight</b> <b>transportation</b> at <b>international</b> level; most of them are simple models that neglect modal split and path choices and are used to support the estimation of <b>freight</b> <b>transportation</b> quantities.

The complexity resides in the specification of a coherent and coordinated system of models, that includes the well-know sequence of generation, distribution, modal split and path choice, to which the departure time and terminal choices have to be added to simulate some of the crucial patterns of <b>international</b> <b>freight</b> transport. Dependences and feedbacks of this problem do not allow to use alternative approaches; for example, the use of time series that leads the relevant approximations when unexpected “breaking” phenomena occur (e.g. a particular and unexpected event in the global economy).|$|R
