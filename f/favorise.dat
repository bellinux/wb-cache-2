The research shows that many of the sectoral social dialogue committees, whether they consider themselves to be active or not on CSR, have been grappling with the core issues raised by the concept over a number of years. The development of the European institutional debate on CSR has clearly led to the ‘redefinition ’ of activities carried out in the framework of the sectoral social dialogue, in some cases offering new impetus to common actions and broadening the scope of debate, while in other cases offering ‘old wine in new bottles’.

40|$|The {{erosion of}} {{biodiversity}} {{is caused by}} many factors. Large ungulates, which occupy {{a large part of}} the Walloon forests, can also influence the distribution and dynamics of plant species. Therefore, they impact the biodiversity of our temperate forests. The aim of the present study is to identify changes in forest understory vegetation due to the pressure exerted by wild ungulates thanks to an exclosure-enclosure experiment. This study was conducted on a high plateau of the Ardenne, in the forest of St Michel Freyr (South Belgium). The forested area is dominated by beech and spruce where red deer, wild boar and roe deer are living in sympatry. 150 sampling plots were established in 2000. Each plot consisted of two closed enclosures of 4 m² each and one exclosure of 4 m² as control under pressure of ungulates. Sampling was carried out systematically by a 500 m-square mesh. The cover rate and height of some easily identifiable species were measured regularly since 2000 (2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, 2007, 2011 - 2012). In addition, we identified each herbaceous species in 2011 - 2012 to analyze the species richness after more than 10 years exclosure. Ligneous species showed an increase of developpement in the fenced area. These species are more impacted when they are not much represented in the study site. Species richness and diversity are higher in areas impacted by herbivory. Monocotyledons are mainly <b>favorised</b> while tree seedlings are unfavorised. Browsing on the trees keeps the area free from high vegetation and allows light to reach the ground. In the same time, herbaceous species have a lower cover rate in the enclosure because of the competitive exclusion induced by shrub and tree seedlings layer. If the apparition of most species is <b>favorised</b> by ungulates, they induce a lag of gowth on dicotyledons which have a higher palatability than monocotyledons. Ungulates have the ability to impact the distribution of vegetal species by the modification of the competitive interaction. By their pressure on tree and shrub species, they induce a higher diversity of the ground flora. However, this change in vegetation composition is slow and requires a long-term studie, specially in areas of low biomass productivity like the St-Hubert forest. Peer reviewe...|$|R

The articles are grouped into five pathogenic tracks: infectious agents, immune system, skeletic muscle, hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis and psychiatric factors. Although a particular infectious agent {{is unlikely to be}} responsible for all CFS cases, evidence is shown that host-parasite relationships are modified in a large proportion of patients with chronic fatigue. Antibody titres against infectious agents are often elevated and replication of several viruses could be increased. Chronic activation of the immune system is also observed and could be due to the reactivation of persistent or latent infectious agents such as herpes viruses (i. e. HHV- 6) or enteroviruses. It could also be <b>favorised</b> by an impaired negative feedback of the HPA axis on the immune system. A model is proposed where the abnormalities of the HPA axis are primary events and are mainly responsible for a chronic activation of the immune system which in turn induces an increased replication of several viruses under the control of cellular transcription factors. These replicating viruses together with cytokines such as TNF-alpha would secondarily induce functional disorders of muscle and several aspects of asthenia itself. Peer reviewe...|$|R

At the northeastern limit of the species ' range, hatchling turtles should seek aquatic hibernacula to avoid freezing; where emergence from the nest is delayed until late autumn, selection pressure for water-seeking behaviour should be " strong. Using pigmented powder that fluoresces under UV light, 78 hatchlings from 12 lakeshore nests and 2 inland nests were tracked for a maximum of 11 days. On the first day after emergence, hatchling movement was random with respect o water. Hatchlings did not orient themselves with respect o slope, vegetation, or nestmates, nor did individuals follow a consistent compass bearing among days. Often trails were convoluted in the open and relatively straight under dense vegetation. Evidence suggests that hatchlings in this population may overwinter in terrestrial as well as aquatic hibernacula.

The overall call reper-toire of the Red-billed Chough was {{twice as large as}} that of the Alpine Chough, but the number of calls recorded in each population did not differ significantly between the two species. The greater fragmentation of the range of the Red-billed Chough possibly induced its remarkable call-repertoire diversification. Some populations (i. e., those from Ethio-pia, Central Asia, Canaries) had a peculiar call repertoire that overlapped very little with those from other regions; con-sequently, the overall numbers of call types within the species were heavily influenced by these unusual populations and were very large. The call-repertoire size and call-repertoire similarity of populations of both species were affected and constrained by geographic distance. More closely situated or continental populations tended to have a more similar pool of calls (this is probably due to mingling among close populations).

Known in war time, it rages also in civilian practice. Two etiologies are dominating :post-trauma gaseous gangrenes, post-surgery gaseous gangrenes. Among post-trauma gaseous gangrenes, the ones on departure of inferior members are the most frequent arising from fractures or from luxations open or closed. Localisation on superior limbs is scarce, specially after soft parts' trauma. We report three cases of superior limbs' gaseous gangrene after seemingly benign trauma.

It didn't exist any <b>favorising</b> agent such as diabetis, arterial insufficiency, intercurrent disease treated with corticoïdes or with immuno-depressors.

This one includes surgical flattening, discharge's incisions and excisions of devitalized tissues, as well as antibiotherapy with 20 000 to 60 000 U penicilline by parenteral way. We didn't need appeal to hyperbare oxygenotherapy. Simple procedures of secondary repair surgery were sufficient to restauration of a normal function. Gaseous gangrene is a real surgical urgency, even without bacteriological proof. © 1984 Société d'Edition de l'Association d'Enseignement Médical des Hôpitaux de Paris.

40|$|The {{volatility}} and {{the uncertainty}} are extended {{in the global}} world, being <b>favorised</b> of the vast proportion {{of the internet and}} by the IT development. The volatility and the uncertainty are contributing to the apperance of the speculative movements that increase the posibilities of the price overestimation of some financial actives on the new markets. The overestimated and optimistic foretell on the flow of some stock exchange deeds, on the new markets, lead to the collapse of the flow and to the fast migration of the capital on the other markets, reason for which the economy of some countries or big areas could be destroied. Taking all this into account the development of the opperations with derivated financial instruments have offerd for the market participants bothe the posibility of hedging and a way of speculation. There are advantages and also disadvantages resulted from the derivated use. The derivated market, similar with the financial markets, either creates welfare, or destroies it, because provides a way to transfer the risk. The derivated help the financial markets to become more eficient and also offers better opportunities for the risk management. There is the posibility that the failure of some big transactions with derivates to lead at the appearance of a systemic risk that could spread inside the financial system...|$|R
40|$|Mammalian {{endothelium}} acts as {{a mediator}} in arterial and venous relaxation and contraction. Endothelium-dependant relaxation is due to endothelial release of powerful, non-prostanoid vasodilatory substances. The best known {{of these is the}} endothelial factor EDRF identified as nitrous oxide (NO). It is the end result of the metabolism of L-arginine by the NO synthetase of endothelial cells. In arterial smooth muscle, the relaxation induced by EDRF is explained by NO stimulation of soluble guanylate cyclase, leading to accumulation of GMPc (cyclic guanosine monophosphate). In some animal vessels and in human coronary arteries, endothelial cells release a substance which induces hyperpolarisation of the cell membrane (endothelial derived hyperpolarising factor, EDHF). Release of EDRF by the cell membrane may be mediated by G proteins sensitive to pertussis toxin (activation of the α 2 adrenoreceptor, serotonin, platelet aggregation leukotrienes) or non- sensitive G proteins (adenosine-diphosphate (ADP), bradykinin). In animal blood vessels where the endothelium is regenerated and reperfused, and/or atherosclerotic, a selective loss of the mechanism of EDRF release is observed, sensitive to pertussis toxin, which <b>favorises</b> vasospasm, thrombosis and cellular proliferation. The available data on isolated or in situ human blood vessels concord with studies on isolated animal tissues. In addition to the relaxation factors, endothelial cells can also secreate contracting factors (endothelium derived contracting factors: EDCF) : these include superoxide anions, endoparoxides, thromboxane A 2 and endothelin. Animal studies indicate that the tendency to release EDCF is maintained or even increased in damaged vessels. The change from normally dominant EDRF release to EDCF release could {{play an important role in}} atherosclerosis. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
