5|$|I'm {{giving you}} an example of how <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>every</b> woman should feel about herself. No matter what anyone tells you – you're too tall, you're too short, you're too big, you're too skinny...there's so many 'rules' to society's view of beauty. I wanted to dispel that and get rid of that. We're all {{beautiful}} in our own unique ways, you just have to find that happy place within yourself. And that's what the record's all about.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>every</b> {{director}} {{thinks that}} he hasn't been allowed to make the films he wanted to make. I certainly haven't {{been able to make}} as many Westerns as I've wanted. (But) sometimes staying alive in a career sense is very important, and you think, 'Maybe I'll do this, which will do well and allow me to do that.' It's very easy to miscalculate. It's a dangerous game. But I think in the end, none of us have anybody to blame except ourselves. It can be very hard. The kinds of things that directors most want to do are usually not things the studio perceives to be commercially viable. It really is that simple. Is that true of me? Sure. Absolutely. But it's no more true of me than 50 other people I know.|$|E
500|$|World Painted Blood {{marked the}} first time that the band wrote {{material}} in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics. The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical. King related: [...] "I was kind of thinking, 'Man, this could be the first record in a long time that's got a little bit of filler,'" [...] he acknowledges. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>every</b> song came out great. I was concerned some would sound similar, and every one is completely different. It's cool how it worked out." [...] The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Kerry King stated: [...] "I like when Jeff writes as much as he did for this record. When you have one guy doing most of the writing you only get one perspective. A lot of Jeff's stuff has a very punky vibe this time; the stuff I write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk, and when Jeff writes the stuff is more punk with a hint of thrash. It works together well." [...] Unlike 2006's Christ Illusion, the band was [...] "under-ready" [...] with their lyrics and music.|$|E
60|$|There {{is nothing}} mystical in all this; it {{is a matter}} of plain, every-day experience, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> nearly <b>every</b> artist will say the same thing about it, if he {{examines}} himself faithfully.|$|R
60|$|DAISY. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> have <b>every</b> {{word you}} have ever written to me--those old letters of ten years ago and the little notes you write to me now. Even though they're {{only two or three}} lines, saying you'll come here or can't come, they're {{precious}} to me.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sure he will. He {{was very}} much {{attached}} to your father, and felt his loss as much as anyone. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>every</b> one of the native officers will do all he can for you." ...|$|R
500|$|Bans called Waller {{getting a}} new penis the most {{emotional}} scene she had to write, adding: [...] "I loved this story because I hate the idea that once you're old, your life is over. I hate when people treat their aging parents like old furniture {{they want to get}} rid of but have to find a place for so they stick 'em in the corner and forget about them." [...] Bans also commented on Heigl's character's storyline, writing: [...] "Poor Izzie. The girl's living with cancer, lost her best friend, impulsively got married and dragged her husband away to live in the woods. That takes a lot out of a person. I need to seriously recover on the couch for an hour after I go to the grocery store – I can't imagine the emotional and physical fatigue Izzie must be feeling right now. I think by the end of this episode, after Owen tells her that channeling her experience as a patient at Seattle Grace is undermining her strength as a doctor at Seattle Grace – she's wondering if she made a mistake. She's wondering if Alex and Derek and now Owen might be right – that she came back to work too soon. That she's not emotionally ready to be cutting into people yet. Because <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>every</b> doctor wants to believe all their terminal patients can be Izzie – but the odds tell another story." ...|$|E
2500|$|In a 2009 interview, Khan {{stated that}} he tends to take an {{independent}} approach {{to the world of}} filmmaking, noting that he does not [...] "do different things; I try {{to do it in a}} different manner. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>every</b> person should follow his/her dream and try and make it possible to create an ability to achieve it backed by its practicality." [...] He has also indicated that he is more interested in the process of filmmaking than in the end result: [...] "For me, the process is more important, more joyful. I would like to have my entire concentration on the process right from the first step." ...|$|E
2500|$|The song [...] "I'll Do It" [...] was {{described}} as Montag getting [...] "racy" [...] due to the song's sexually explicit lyrics stating to [...] "come eat my panties off of me." [...] Montag addressed the issue by stating [...] "I love it. I'm a very sexual person and I'm married, so it's okay. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>every</b> woman ... has an alter ego. We all have that really sexual, fun side. I just thought the lyrics were so fun and so sexy. They empower women. That song, when my friends hear it, they feel sexier. They have more fun, because the song is like, 'I'll do whatever you want, but I'm still kind of in charge here.' The lyrics are definitely a little edgy - and I'm sorry to the little girls - but I am married. Eat the panties off when you're married." ...|$|E

The next that I shall hear from him will be from round some corner in the {{neighbourhood}} of Galway. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> know <b>every</b> turn in that blackguard's mind." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Boys," [...] said Mr. Smith, [...] "I don't rightly know. If I have to quit, {{the next}} move is to the city. But I don't reckon that I will have to quit. I've got an idee that <b>I</b> <b>think's</b> good <b>every</b> time." ...|$|R
500|$|Clarke {{has been}} {{described}} by Stephen Banfield as the most distinguished British female composer of the inter-war generation. However, her later output was sporadic. She suffered from dysthymia, a chronic form of depression; the lack of encouragement—sometimes outright discouragement—she received for her work also made her reluctant to compose. Clarke did not consider herself able to balance her personal life and the demands of composition: [...] "I can't do it unless it's the first thing <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>every</b> morning when I wake and the last thing <b>I</b> <b>think</b> of <b>every</b> night before I go to sleep." [...] After her marriage, she stopped composing, despite the encouragement of her husband, although she continued working on arrangements until shortly before her death. She also stopped performing.|$|R
2500|$|A month later, at the recommissioning {{ceremony}} for {{the aircraft carrier}} Wasp, McCormick aroused comment by indicating that atomic bombs had been developed that were small enough to be carried by the light bombers deployed on aircraft carriers. [...] "Eventually, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>every</b> carrier will be equipped with atomic bombs. Since their reduction in size they have become more available for carrier use." [...] His remarks were consistent with his previous statement while acting chief of naval operations that atomic weapons use should be treated more normally: [...] "It is in our interest to convince {{the world at large}} that the use of atomic weapons is no less humane than the employment of an equivalent weight of so-called conventional weapons. The destruction of certain targets is essential to the successful completion of a war with the U.S.S.R. The pros and cons of the means to accomplish their destruction is purely academic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Her self-hatred {{accelerated}} into raging {{cycles of}} bulimia and anorexia, repressing the issue until questioned. Jackson said, [...] "people say to me: `Okay, you've {{got to start}} eating more. You're too thin.' But when {{you look in the}} mirror, you see something totally different." [...] She continued, [...] "I had swung so far in one direction, I never thought I could swing so far in the other. You're losing weight and getting smaller, and I'd still say to myself I could afford to lose a little more". However, she refused professional guidance, reluctant to examination. She briefly saw a psychologist before an encounter with a spiritual guru, who aided her emotional recovery. Jackson recounted, [...] "we went to this very spiritual place in the desert... That's where I met him, this cowboy. He's in his fifties, and he's full of wisdom. He's an older man who has experienced a great deal, and he {{used to be in the}} music industry, on a smaller scale. He even understood that side of my life". She also began using coffee enemas to remove [...] "sad cells", leading to media scrutiny. The trauma lead to a brief duration of sexual questioning, saying [...] "Am I curious? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>every</b> girl has wondered". Jackson culminated the experiences into the album's subject matter, recording over two years.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2011, Silas takes a dislike to Riley's fiancé, Mercedes McQueen (Jennifer Metcalfe), {{after he}} learns of her promiscuity. Silas {{attempts}} and fails to attack Mercedes with a candlestick when her back is turned. Metcalfe later hinted that Mercedes {{may have to}} watch her back in the future {{when it comes to}} Silas. She said [...] " [...] is a tough cookie, isn't he? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>every</b> girl in the village needs to watch their back where Silas is concerned..." [...] In October 2011, it was reported that Silas would hold Mercedes captive in a vault. Silas decides to teach heavily pregnant Mercedes a lesson after she confesses to an affair with Riley's father, Carl Costello (Paul Opacic). Silas's plan is to keep Mercedes alive until she has given birth and then murder her. Metcalfe called the plot [...] "brilliant" [...] and said it was [...] "quite flattering" [...] to be trusted with it. The actress explained that Mercedes thinks that she is going to die whilst being help captive. Mercedes also fears that her baby is going to die. Metcalfe said that it does not take long for Mercedes to realise that Silas is responsible for the recent murders. Silas wants to keep the baby alive, but not Mercedes. Therefore, Silas does the [...] "bare minimum" [...] for Mercedes, giving her water, a small amount of food and keeping her warm. Daniel Kilkelly of Digital Spy opined that storyline sounds [...] "really dark" [...] and asked Metcalfe whether Hollyoaks are pushing the boundaries with it. Metcalfe revealed that [...] "they are a little bit", saying [...] "It's all shot in a very clever way, so it was fine when it came to compliance. But it was difficult {{and there was a lot}} of stuff that we had to be really careful about when we were filming it." [...] Metcalfe would not reveal whether Mercedes survives her encounter with Silas.|$|E
5000|$|Landis's {{career was}} not {{significantly}} affected by the incident, although he said in 1996: [...] "There was absolutely no good aspect about this whole story. The tragedy, which <b>I</b> <b>think</b> about <b>every</b> day, had {{an enormous impact on}} my career, from which it may possibly never recover." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But it's a {{very big}} house, and I've been, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> into <b>every</b> room since I have been here, and I've moved most of the {{furniture}} in the drawing-rooms with my own hand, and I've counted the pounds of butter, and inspected the sheets and tablecloths." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{defending}} {{a proposal to}} cut access to the SNAP program (food stamps), Arrington cited the biblical passage Thessalonians 3-10. “He says {{even when we were}} with you we give you this rule, ‘If a man will not work he shall not eat.’ And {{he goes on to say}} ‘We heard that some of you are idle.’ <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>every</b> American, Republican or Democrat wants to help the needy among us.
