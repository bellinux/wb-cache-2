40|$|BACKGROUND: Motor cortex {{stimulation}} (MCS) {{was introduced}} in the early 1990 s by Tsubokawa and his group for patients diagnosed with drug-resistant, central neuropathic pain. Inconsistencies concerning the details of this therapy and its outcomes and poor methodology of most clinical essays divide the neuromodulation society worldwide into "believers" and "nonbelievers. " A European <b>expert</b> <b>meeting</b> was organized in Brussels, Belgium by the Benelux Neuromodulation Society in order to develop uniform MCS protocols in the preoperative, intraoperative, and postoperative courses. METHODS: An <b>expert</b> <b>meeting</b> was organized, and a questionnaire was sent out to all the invited participants before this <b>expert</b> <b>meeting.</b> An extensive literature research was conducted in order to enrich the results. RESULTS: Topics that were addressed during the <b>expert</b> <b>meeting</b> were 1) inclusion and exclusion criteria, 2) targeting and methods of stimulation, 3) effects of MCS, and 4) results from the questionnaire. CONCLUSIONS: Substantial commonalities but also important methodologic divergencies emerged from the discussion of MCS experts from 7 European Centers. From this meeting and questionnaire, all participants concluded {{that there is a need}} for more homogenous standardized protocols for MCS regarding patient selection, implantation procedure, stimulation parameters, and follow-up-course...|$|R
