40|$|The {{article of}} record {{may be found}} at [URL] {{software}} interface between the MATLAB/Simulink environment and the Satellite <b>Tool</b> <b>Kit</b> Environment is introduced. This research {{is based on the}} need for validating model performance and visualizing simultaneous multiple-spacecraft proximity maneuvers for emerging missions. It is common for spacecraft systems to be modeled with MATLAB and Simulink. Furthermore, the software package Satellite <b>Tool</b> <b>Kit</b> is often used for animating and evaluating spacecraft maneuvers. In this research, a MATLAB/Satellite <b>Tool</b> <b>Kit</b> interface was developed to propagate six-degree-of-freedom spacecraft models, compared against Satellite-Tool-Kit-generated ephemeris, and animated for analysis. MATLAB script with necessary formatting is used for Satellite <b>Tool</b> <b>Kit</b> initialization and animation. The MATLAB/Satellite <b>Tool</b> <b>Kit</b> simulation interface allows variations in number, shape, and dimensions of spacecraft. Additionally, numerous model and simulation parameters can be selected and synchronized between MATLAB and Satellite <b>Tool</b> <b>Kit.</b> Furthermore, either predetermined, or randomly distributed, initial spacecraft positions and orientations are permitted by the interface. The paper gives enough details to allow the interested readers to adapt to their needs and further develop the proposed software interface...|$|R

The advantages and shortcomings of the <b>tool</b> <b>kit</b> approach in providing decision support is empirically examined.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} <b>tool</b> <b>kit</b> {{to produce a}} domain {{ontology}} for text mining, based on case frames automatically constructed from a raw corpus of a specific domain. Since case frames are strongly related to implicit facts hidden in large domain-specific corpora, {{we can say that}} case frames are a promising device for text mining. The aim of the <b>tool</b> <b>kit</b> is to enable automatic analysis of event reports, from which implicit factors of the events are to be extracted. The <b>tool</b> <b>kit</b> enables us to produce a domain ontology by iterating associative retrieval of case frames and manual refinement. In this study, the <b>tool</b> <b>kit</b> is applied to the Japan Airlines pilot report collection, and a domain ontology of contributing factors in the civil aviation domain is experimentally produced. A lot of interesting examples are found in the ontology. In addition, a brief examination of the production process shows the efficiency of the <b>tool</b> <b>kit.</b> 1. Background Recently, report collection systems on safety events have been developed, to prevent accidents and failure cases in civil aviation, railway systems, medicine and other indus-tries.
