5000|$|Unlike most fabric/yard goods {{which are}} {{sold by the}} yard (or metre), silk is sold to the {{wholesaler}} by weight. The first step in processing the silk fiber is [...] "degumming the fibre," [...] the gum being a byproduct of {{the production of the}} silk fibre by the worm. Approximately one-fifth of the weight of the silk fibre is lost in the degumming process, and manufacturers felt they had the [...] "right" [...] to replace this lost weight with a filler of some sort. Silk has an affinity for several metallic salts, the most common of which being iron, lead, and tin. It was discovered to be an easy process to return this weight lost in the degumming process by soaking the fibre in a bath of these metallic salts. This process was called weighting, and by increasing the weight of the raw silk, the merchant increased his profit. Weighting with some metallic salts did improve the <b>drapeability</b> of the fibre; however greedy merchants soon began adding more weight than the lost one-fifth; sometimes the final weight was increased tenfold.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Many {{researchers}} {{examined the}} static <b>drapeability</b> of textiles, {{they found that}} the textiles with different materials, structures or finishing have different drape characteristic. They analyzed also apart the static measuring the <b>drapeability</b> influenced with dynamical effect. They measured the dynamic <b>drapeability</b> during rotating the textile sample [1]. They found that the form of the draped sample is change from the dynamic effect. The Sylvie 3 D Drape Tester developed at BUTE record all the surface of draped textiles with scanning technology, and the evaluating computer system define the usual <b>drapeability</b> parameters, like node number and drape coefficient. We complete the equipment with a tool with which we can examine the <b>drapeability</b> after different exactly defined dynamic effect...|$|E
40|$|A {{method to}} improve the <b>drapeability</b> of Spread Tow Fabric (STF) of carbon fibres by {{introducing}} cuts to the fabric at the tow level is investigated. Two cutting patterns, different distances between the cuts and two cut sizes were trialled. The <b>drapeability</b> was assessed by means of optical scanning system (ATOS scanner) and a specially developed compliance test. The mechanical performance of the plates manufactured with the cut material was evaluated through a tensile test by measuring the stiffness and the strength in tension. The parameters that affect the <b>drapeability</b> and the mechanical performance were also studied. It was found {{that it is possible}} to tailor enhanced <b>drapeability</b> with a trade-off of the mechanical properties which might be acceptable for some applications. The reduction in mechanical properties varied with respect to the cutting pattern and to the distances between the cuts within the same pattern (the resultant fibre length).

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} project has been to study the basic {{technologies}} needed to introduce local Point Cutting of fiber weaves (local PC) into composites manufacturing. An automated cutting machine is here used to locally increase the <b>drapeability</b> of standard weaves, hence easing tool loading and the automation of a production line. The two tested softwares cannot simulate draping using precut fiber weaves. <b>Drapeability</b> experiments can instead be used to select cutting pattern and cutting area. The used tool concept (one piece tool half, several tool parts, bag etc.) will affect the minimum size of the cutting area. Several cutting patterns have been tested including the innovative cross pattern, which works best. Micro-mechanical analysis and FE simulations show that the cured material properties can be predicted. A composite part has been successfully manufactured usinglocal PC technology.

40|$|Although the drape {{characteristics}} {{of a piece of}} 2 D flat fabric can be measured by a drape meter or by image analysis method, when fabrics go through several operations during garment constructions, their drape behaviors are altered.

40|$|Amongst the {{different}} property {{parameters of the}} produced fabric, <b>drapeability</b> of fabric {{is one of the}} crucial parameters with respect to end uses. It is the ability of fabric to hang freely in graceful folds when some area of it is supported over a surface and the rest is unsupported. During the application of different fabrics, both in industrial and apparel sector, it has been observed that the ability of the fabric to assume a graceful appearance of the contour is very vital conveying the significance of <b>drapeability</b> of the fabric. With the growing environmental concerns and eco-sustainability, the global emphasis is towards the application of ecoconcordant, bio-degradable, renewable green products and this has inclined towards the natural fibre-made fabrics scoring them over their manmade counter parts and making them a natural choice for the mankind. The natural fibre-made fabrics have proven records of efficacy to prove their mettle match with manmade fabrics in different areas of application. This paper has reviewed and analyzed the various attributes of natural fibre-made fabrics such as jute, cotton, silk and wool focusing mainly on their draping behavior, determining their strengths and weakness considering the future direction of research to overcome their deficiencies...|$|E
40|$|<b>Drapeability</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} visual properties affecting garment appearance. Even though there are many studies concerned with fabric drape, understanding about the drape behaviour of garments is very limited. This study analyzes the key properties affecting the drape behaviour of garments to provide prediction equations. Results are statistically analyzed. From multiple regression analysis, drape rank scores obtained from subjective analyses are predicted using weight, bending modulus and extensibility measured at 100 gf/cm with a correlation coefficient of 0. 94. Ranking values obtained from subjective analyses can be more easily predicted using both circularity and wave length minimum. A new equation was derived to predict drape rank score values of garments (correlation coefficient r = 0. 97) depending on circularity and wavelength minimum...|$|E
40|$|Fabric drapes {{are typical}} large displacement, large {{rotation}} and small strain problems. Compared to conventional geometric non-linear shell analyses, computational fabric drape analysis is particularly challenging {{due to the}} extremely weak bending rigidities of fabrics. Compared to continuum shell finite element methods, grid- or particle-based methods {{appear to be more}} successful in high <b>drapeability</b> problems. The latter methods often resort to simple particle mechanics and formulate the elastic energy in terms of the inter-particle distances and trigonometrical functions of the angles between the straight lines joining adjacent particles. In this paper, the co-rotational approach and commonly employed assumptions for small strain problems in finite element analysis will be adopted to formulate the elastic energy. It will be seen that the internal force vector and the stiffness matrix are considerably simpler than other grid-based models, yet the sparsity of the tangential stiffness matrix remains unchanged. A number of examples are considered and the predicted results are promising. © 2003 John Wiley and Sons, Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{different}} synthetic softeners viz anionic, nonionic, and cationic softeners on physical properties i. e., stiffness, crease recovery and drape ability of cotton khadi fabric {{has been presented}} in this study. Effect of different concentration of finishing agents and thickness of fabric on stiffness, crease recovery and <b>drapeability</b> has been analyzed. It was found that alteration in softness of fabric application depends, to an extent (in part) upon amount of finish used. As on increasing the concentration of finish there was decrease in bending length and drape coefficient. It also depends upon type of finishing agents used. Maximum decrease in drape coefficient and stiffness was seen in fabrics. After treatment of various softeners drape coefficient of khadi fabrics have been decreased and fabric becomes very lumpy. Highest decrease in drape coefficient {{has been found in}} mediun weight khadi fabrics treated with all softeners. As the concentration of softeners increased drape coefficient was decreased simultaneously.

40|$|AbstractHand layup {{is still}} the {{dominant}} forming process {{for the creation of}} the widest range of complex geometry and mixed material composite parts. However, this process is still poorly understood and informed, limiting productivity. This paper seeks to address this issue by proposing a novel and low cost system enabling a laminator to be guided in real-time, based on a predetermined instruction set, thus improving the standardisation of produced components. Within this paper the current methodologies are critiqued and future trends are predicted, prior to introducing the required input and outputs, and developing the implemented system. As a demonstrator a U-Shaped component typical of the complex geometry found in many difficult to manufacture composite parts was chosen, and its <b>drapeability</b> assessed by the use of a kinematic drape simulation tool. An experienced laminator's knowledgebase was then used to divide the tool into a finite number of features, with layup conducted by projecting and sequentially highlighting target features while tracking a laminator's hand movements across the ply. The system has been implemented with affordable hardware and demonstrates tangible benefits in comparison to currently employed laser-based systems. It has shown remarkable success to date, with rapid Technology Readiness Level advancement. This is a major stepping stone towards augmenting manual labour, with further benefits including more appropriate automation...|$|E
40|$|In {{most of the}} applications, {{textiles}} require {{specific surface}} preparation to control designated categories of fabric performance – for example, dye uptake and retention, adhesion and wettability – or various organoleptic properties specific to the targeted end use of the fabric. There are several methods available to apply patterns and improve color control and retention on a fabric. Among the various methods for modification of surfaces of synthetic or natural fibers, laser treatment facilitating the fabric dyeing and finishing has found increasingly broad applications {{in the past few}} years. This study examined the effects of laser treatment on fabric surface in the context of changes in organoleptic fabric properties, including shape and dimensions retention, deformability, shape conformation or <b>drapeability</b> and other properties commonly considered as ‘hand feel’. One cotton fabric and two polyester/cotton blended fabrics were treated with laser and evaluated by the Kawabata Evaluation System for Fabric (KES-F) and by PhabrOmeter, which were used to test the hand feel value of the fabric. It was found through this work that the fabric's hand feel decreases with increase of pixel resolution and the energy density associated with the laser power output and time of fabric exposure to laser treatment.

40|$|Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM) {{has proven}} to be a cost {{effective}} production method for nearnet shaped products with a high accuracy and a high reproducibility. It makes RTM suitable for the manufacture of complex shaped products. The applicability of non-crimp fabrics (NCFs) in RTM offers both lower cost and improved through-thickness properties with no significant drop in in-plane properties compared to woven fabrics, due to better crimp and <b>drapeability</b> properties. Accurate flow simulations are an essential tool in finding the optimal process parameters, in particular for complex shaped structural components as applied in the aircraft industry. One of the most critical parameters in the mould filling simulations is the permeability of the fibre preform, which is in essence a geometric quantity. Geometrical changes, such as compaction and drape affect the permeability. This research aims to predict the permeability on a local level. The local permeability depends on the geometrical features of non-crimp fabrics and the influences of fabric deformation on these features. The proposed geometric model is based on the distortions induced by the stitches penetrating the uni-directional fibre layers. Fibres are forced aside by the needle penetrating the individual layers during the production cycle. The fibres enclose the thread, which is left behind by the needle, formin...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} meet the new {{environmental}} regulations about the low carbon dioxide emissions to the atmosphere the automotive industries have been working to develop lightweight composite body structures for the new passenger cars. The use of NCF (Non-Crimp Fabric) reinforced carbon composites in the luxury cars have now been stretched to the passenger cars. The in-plane deformation behaviour of bi-axial NCF based structural thermoset prepregs is determined and analysed keeping in view to their potential use in the car body parts. Two types of stitched carbon fabrics, pillar and tricot with an aerial weight of 400 gsm of each, used in the epoxy based thermoset prepreg are considered for the measurement of in-plane shear behaviour. The de-facto standard methods of bias extension and picture frame tests for intraply shear characterisation have been used at the relevant processing conditions for high volume manufacturing applications. It has been observed that the prepreg deformation behaviour is significantly influenced by the selection of process parameters. Moreover, the suitability of each of the two methods for the particular types of NCF based thermoset prepregs will be discussed. Further to the above, the in-plane deformation tests have also been performed on the dry reinforcement of the same prepreg materials {{in order to determine the}} influence of resin on the <b>drapeability</b> of the material as well as its response to the processing parameters...|$|E
40|$|Within {{the field}} of {{composite}} manufacturing simulations, {{it is well known}} that the bending behavior of fabrics and prepregs has a significant influence on the <b>drapeability</b> and final geometry of a composite part. Due to sliding between reinforcements within a fabric, the bending properties cannot be determined from in-plane properties and a separate test is required. The Peirce cantilever test represents a popular way of determining the flexural rigidity for these materials, and is the preferred method in the ASTM D 1388 standard. This work illustrates the severe inaccuracies (up to 72 % error) in the current ASTM D 1388 standard as well as the original formulation by Peirce, caused by ignoring higher-order effects. A modified approach accounting for higher-order effects and yielding significantly improved accuracy is presented. The method is validated using finite element simulations and experimental testing. Since no independent tests other than the ASTM D 1388 standard are available to determine the bending stiffness of fabric materials, experimental validation is performed on an isotropic, homogeneous Upilex- 50 S foil for which the flexural rigidity and tensile stiffness are related. The flexural rigidity and elastic modulus are determined through both the cantilever test (ASTM D 1388) and tensile testing. The results show that the proposed method measures an elastic modulus close to that determined through tensile testing (within 1 %), while both the Peirce formulation (+ 18 %) and ASTM standard (+ 72 %) over-estimate the elastic modulus. The proposed methodology allows for a more accurate determination of flexural rigidity, and enables the more accurate simulation of composite forming processes...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} way in which fabric characteristics; in {{particular}} the <b>drapeability</b> can influence and create three-dimensional form for garments. The aim is to combine scientific, visual and drape research and design methodologies to better inform the final design outcome - in this case a collcction of garments. The characteristics of a fabric influence the draping effect. How fabrics with different drapeabilities influence design ideas and final forms is explored and revealed in this thesis. An experimental fabric drape testing method is developed, which is suitable for the design processes of a practicing designer in order to investigate fabrics' drape characteristics. Six fabrics are chosen from the experiments that establish the quantitative and visual evidences for the design development. Each fabric is draped into one form according to its characteristic that influences the design ideas. Then other fabrics arc draped into the same form to provide comparisons of their different performances and evaluate how they create different appearances for the same form. A range of three-dimensional effects that are different from conventional garment shapes are created in which the fabric controls the final form. Various draping methods inspired by selected contemporary designers are employed to design the spatial effects around the body. Concepts of deconstruction, imperfection, volume, voids and architectural shape, are addressed in the design methodology. The collection "Changing Dresses" is the final outcome of the initial design research, in which six dresses are creatcd with variations from a single basic form. A range of draping methods are employed that best highlight the qualities of the fabrics and create sculptural forms that reflect the knowledge of fabrics on the body gained through the research. The three-dimensional garments, thus, stem from the research into the relationships among fabric characteristics and draping methods...|$|E
40|$|Woven {{carbon fiber}} {{composites}} are being extensively used in aerospace, automotive and civil applications, owing to their high specific strength, higher fracture toughness, and <b>drapeability</b> {{as compared to}} unidirectional composites. The processing phase of composite manufacturing has a high added value to the processed laminate, so any damage during machining has a significant economical impact. However, the characteristic attributes like non-homogeneous structure, anisotropy and high abrasiveness of fibers coupled with non-optimized cutting parameters and tool wear can result in damage to the laminate. This experimental research involves quantifying the effect of processing parameters i. e. spindle speed, feed, and tool wear on hole quality during the drilling of a quasi-isotropic woven graphite fiber epoxy laminate. Drilling tests were conducted for wide range of spindle speeds (1, 500 rpm to 15, 000 rpm) and feed rates (20 μm/rev to 800 μm/rev) with a 5 mm diameter standard point tungsten carbide twist drill. This investigation extended the drilling approach to evaluate the benefits of high speed (12, 000 rpm and 15, 000 rpm) and high feed (600 - 800 μm/rev) regimes, which were not explored or reported in the open literature. Dependence of damage mechanisms; namely, delamination, fiber pull out, thermal damage, surface roughness deterioration, hole circularity and hole diameter errors, on cutting conditions was established. A strong correlation between different types of damages and cutting forces and temperature was also identified. High speed drilling approach produced contrasting results as spindle speed of 15, 000 rpm was found to reduce delamination damage and improve surface roughness but increase the hole circularity and diameter errors. Machinability maps were designed to illustrate the affect of cutting parameters on delamination damage, hole circularity, hole diameter error and hole surface roughness. The application of machinability maps as an aid for process engineers to avoid damage and optimize the process is demonstrated. Finally, {{it was concluded that}} the process could be controlled and delamination be eliminated by increasing the spindle speed up to 15, 000 rpm and feed rate up to 100 mum/rev. It results a higher productivity if a compromise on hole circularity and diameter tolerances is accepted. Having established the benefits of high speed and low feed drilling, tool wear was evaluated at 12, 000 rpm and 15, 000 rpm and optimal feed rate of 100 mum/rev. Chipping, abrasion and adhesion of carbon were found to be the main wear mechanisms. Abrasion at the flank face of the drills was identified to be the main wear process that controls the deterioration of the drill at high speeds. The three wear regimes i. e. primary, secondary, and tertiary, were found to strongly influence the thrust force, delamination damage, hole circularity, diameter error and hole surface roughness. Finally, the tool wear analysis revealed that a tool change strategy could be devised by monitoring the thrust force, rather than measuring the progression of flank wear...|$|E
40|$|The use of {{knitting}} technology with advanced fibres such as glass, carbon and aramid, to produce near-net-shape fabrics has {{in recent years}} received increasing interest from the composite materials community. Knitted fabrics have the potential of being used in engineering structures with complex shapes {{in conjunction with a}} suitable liquid moulding technique, such as Resin Transfer Moulding (RTM), due to their excellent <b>drapeability</b> and manufacturability. During previous studies in textile reinforced composites, an intimate relationship between the fabric architecture and the damage development has been demonstrated. In this work, the quasi-static tensile loading deformation behaviour and the relation between the fabric architecture and damage development have been studied for a weft knitted glass fabric. Tensile properties have been examined and the failure mechanisms have been identified experimentally by analysing the damage process in-situ with a camera and by studying fracture surfaces using scanning electron microscopy (SEM). The acoustic emission technique was used to support the microscopic analysis. The work has investigated the tensile properties and failure mechanisms of three knitted fabric reinforced composite laminates reinforced with a Milano weft knitted glass fabric. The three composites were (i) a single layer of fabric reinforcing epoxy resin, (ii) a single knitted fabric layer sandwiched between 0 ° glass fibre unidirectional plies (again with the glass reinforcing epoxy resin), and (iii) the same knitted glass fabric but this time used as the reinforcement in commercially produced high fibre volume fraction composites (using the RTM technique). The variation of mechanical properties with angle (from wale to course) has been measured for the single layer of the fabric reinforcing epoxy resin by orientating the wale direction of the fabric at different angles. Mechanical properties have been measured for each angular orientation and comparisons were made between them, especially with regard to the planes of final failure. The single layer composites failed as soon as the first damage was initiated. Hence, to investigate damage accumulation, a novel technique was employed to manufacture a sandwich laminate, which consisted in placing a single knitted fabric layer between 0 ° glass fibre unidirectional plies. The success of this method is that the accumulation of damage in the knitted architecture was allowed to be studied and some characteristics of crack initiation and crack propagation could be related to the fabric geometry and structure. Experiments on these model transparent materials have been complemented by tests on two types of commercial knitted fabric composite manufactured by the RTM process. Characterization of these materials under tensile loading has been carried out for monotonic and cyclic loading and the results have been compared with those found for the single layer and the sandwich model material. Various failure mechanisms such as cracking at loop cross-over points, resin matrix cracking, fibre bundle debonding and tensile fracture of fibre bundles in failed specimens were observed. The behaviour of the commercial RTM specimens has been discussed {{in the light of the}} results obtained from the model single layer and sandwich specimens...|$|E
