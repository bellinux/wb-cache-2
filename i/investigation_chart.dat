Whether global warming threatens this water supply is the focus of this research. This study builds upon a previous Global Climate Change Response Program <b>investigation.</b> <b>Charts</b> were generated of four geopotential height parameters for a domain covering the eastern North Pacific Ocean and western North America. Out of 131 total winter months (from 1946 - 89), 35 were selected as analogues. Monthly mean precipitation values for areas in western Montana, northern Utah, and east central Arizona were compared with median values for the 1946 - 89 period to determine if any significant differences existed. The results suggest that one regional impact of global warming may be a substantial reduction in wintertime precipitation in central and southern intermountain areas such as Utah and Arizona. The study also found the situation in western Montana to be unclear.

40|$|Unionists part ways when {{it comes}} to the {{practical}} meaning of solidarity with workers who lack work permits. To some union members, undocumented migrant workers ought to be included in the bonds of union solidarity by virtue of being workers. To others, undocumented migrant workers are primarily illegal and unfair competitors undermining existing institutions of solidarity. In this controversial context, six union centers for undocumented migrant workers called MigrAr (German "Migration & Arbeit", English "migration & labor") have been established by labor activists since 2008. Building on an activist ethnography in the MigrAr center in Berlin from 2011 to 2015, this <b>investigation</b> <b>charts</b> the challenges of this center to bring unions to adopt a more proactive and inclusive approach towards illegalized migrant workers. In the analysis, the research critically engages Jürgen Habermas's concept of solidarity and its premise of symmetrical relationships. To account for the uneven constellation of support between MigrAr activists and undocumented migrant workers, the study advances an alternative understanding of union solidarity. Addressing labor activists and scholars in the social sciences, this book gives detailed insights in a controversial field of union activism in Germany.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reviews the}} effects of {{oestrogen}} deprivation by third generation aromatase inhibitors on molecular profiles in breast cancers. It particularly focuses on results obtained {{as a result of}} pre-operative and neoadjuvant therapy in which primary breast cancers have been biopsied or excised before and during treatment with letrozole, anastrozole or exemestane. Studies may be subdivided into those evaluating early (10 - 14 days) or late (3 - 4 months) changes; a single <b>investigation</b> <b>charted</b> sequential changes. Early changes involved downregulation of genes classically induced by oestrogen or associated with cell cycle and proliferation. In contrast, expressions of genes associated with stromal signatures were upregulated. Considerably more genes were changed at later time-points; these probably represent not only primary effects on cellular expression but the secondary consequences on cell death and clonal selection. Thus, after 3 - 4 months of treatment mitochondrial-related genes and those associated with cell cycle and cell division were downregulated whereas genes associated with extracellular matrix (ECM) remodeling, vascularization, inflammatory responses and cell adhesion were upregulated. Recently, observations have been reported from a study in which tumours were sequentially sampled to include pretreatment and both early and later time-points. This allowed direct monitoring of the dynamic changes in gene expression. Different patterns of changes in gene expression were identified which were also associated with general differences in sub-cellular distribution of functional proteins. The effect of treatment on expression of specific genes and processes such as aromatase, oestrogen receptor (ER), oestrogen-regulated genes, HER 2, p 53, ribosomal proteins, markers of proliferation, oxidative phosphorylation and stromal response are summarized...|$|R

40|$|Aló Presidente was {{a weekly}} {{television}} programme anchored and produced by Hugo Chávez during his presidency in Venezuela. The show, {{a version of}} a phone-in, was broadcast live on national television at 11 am on Sundays and lasted on average six hours. It followed the presidential agenda to a new location every week, where Hugo Chávez would inaugurate factories, read Latin American poetry, interview Fidel Castro, and sing llanero songs. This thesis investigates the role that Aló Presidente played {{in the making of}} the “Bolivarian Revolution”, Hugo Chávez’s political project. Through a critical reading of the transcripts of the show, it explores the 378 episodes, or 1656 hours, that aired between 1999 and 2012. Aló Presidente was the cornerstone of Chávez’s political communication, replacing press conferences and interviews. Chávez was known for his continuous presence on radio and television and his daily presidential addresses. However, only on the Sunday show could the audience phone the president and share their ideas, emotions and everyday life concerns. This thesis reviews the narratives that underlined the relationship between the audience/electorate and the host/president on Aló Presidente. It is argued that Aló Presidente played a fundamental role in articulating the identity of a public that shared the values and ideas of Chávez’s hegemonic project. Moreover, it is argued that the show Aló Presidente and the ideological process called the “Bolivarian Revolution” can be read as two co-related arms of a same project, and that they informed and defined each other throughout Chávez’s presidency. In this context, this thesis assesses the evolution of the programme in light of the political events taking place in Venezuela during that time. Aló Presidente is thus seen as a repository, or “black box”, of the discourses that articulated the Bolivarian identity and constructed the legitimacy of Hugo Chávez as the leader of a populist movement in Venezuela. Finally, the core of this thesis is that the co-relation between the show and the hegemonic project evolved over time to strengthen the authoritarian tendencies of Hugo Chávez’s regime. Following the activities of Aló Presidente over 13 years, the <b>investigation</b> <b>charts</b> that evolution in three different stages: 1) participation, 2) education, and 3) obedience, arguing that what started as a seemingly participatory space, progressively became a platform that presented Hugo Chávez’s figure as the ideologue of a populist movement, and ultimately secured his position as the indisputable leader and sole authority of Venezuela’s “Bolivarian Revolution”...|$|R

40|$|The {{falling weight}} {{deflectometer}} (FWD) is used worldwide as an established, valuable, nondestructive road testing device for pavement structural analyses. The FWD is used mostly for rehabilitation project level design investigations and for pavement management system (PMS) monitoring {{on a network}} basis. In project level <b>investigations,</b> design <b>charts</b> based on both empirical relations and mechanistic or theoretically based approaches are often used to provide structural evaluations and rehabilitation options. The full mechanistic approach normally uses multi-layer linear elastic theory and back-calculation procedures that have come under scrutiny owing to the inaccuracy of results. A semi-mechanistic, semi-empirical analysis technique has been developed in South Africa in terms of which deflection bowl parameters, measured with the FWD, are used in a relative benchmarking methodology in conjunction with standardised visual survey methodology to give guidance on individual layer strengths and pinpoint rehabilitation needs. This benchmark methodology enables {{the determination of the}} relative structural condition of the pavement over length and in depth without the requirement for detailed as-built data.

40|$|This <b>investigation</b> <b>charts</b> {{a number}} of {{complementary}} explorations {{at the site of}} electronic media in art practice and design and media education. Artists are increasingly using video and computer technology in the production of their work, and these shifts are reflected in the way design and media courses are taught in Higher Education. This study seeks to relate {{a number of}} often contentious issues, but complex questions are central to any debate about the use of electronic imaging technologies by artists and the implications for teaching and learning. In this respect, the thesis is informed by my dual role as an artist using electronic media and as a lecturer in video and digital imaging in the Media Department at the University of Westminster. The study is based on a particular model of action research, and seeks after the manner of Glaser and Strauss (1967) to "ground" theory in the aggregate perceptions, understandings, and artistic or pedagogical orientations of those seeking to bring order to their own experiences in the settings. The text is arranged in eleven chapters. It begins by introducing the boundaries of the phenomena under study (which is necessarily ragged and untidy and challengingly gritty, since the composite issues have yet to have attracted any clarity of exposition, and the field is in any case characterised by imaginative leaps and cross-fertilisation) and the methodological and idealogical stances adopted. Methodologically the thesis is wide-ranging and eclectic, although also contained within the kind of feminist epistomology proposed by Sandra Harding (1992), Marnier Lazreg (1994) and others. It then moves on to examine a number of focal points and issues related to the use to which electronic media is put by artists. These topics include my own sustained attempts to develop non-linear computer systems for mapping associative thoughts, and a more general and more detailed study of the principles and characteristics of these systems when they are used for holding information about knowledge domains. Following this, there is a chapter dedicated to the application of these principles to a particular knowledge domain, colour theory, with the aim of designing a computer aided learning package. The interconnections between all the topics, issues and themes studied in the text are highlighted {{in the middle of the}} thesis before moving on to more specific investigation of the issue of gender in both technological education and creativity, with an emphasis on the use of imaging technologies by women artists. The impact of these technologies in terms of shifting aesthetic values and tastes forms the basis of the final chapter, and a conclusion seeks to offer both a tentative intellectual synopsis and to indicate how the exercise has influenced and affected my work as an artist. I am aware that to some extent this arrangement challenges both the linear quality of conventional research reportage and academic distrust of promiscuously interpenetrating ideas. I trust that this form of discourse, deliberately chosen, is experienced as working within its own terms...|$|R

What Boal is {{referring}} to is that the theater should be political and used to promote social change by allowing the spectator to not only act out roles on stage, but to carry those rehearsed actions into the world, outside of the theater. The theater created by Mexican-Americans in the Southwest United States in the Mid- 1960 's, referred to as Chicano theater, exemplifies Boal's method of theater, containing a similar purpose (political activism) as well as many theatrical elements: audience participation, improvisation, what Boal calls “nationalizing texts,” investigation of events used as basis for plays, and variations of Boal's Joker method. The information in this investigation comes from various sources including plays, historical texts, literary criticism, journal articles, and films. To talk specifically of theater, the focus is on three authors and their works: Augusto Boal, and two of his theoretical texts; the Chicano Playwright, Luis Valdez and his Teatro Campesino; and the troupe, Teatro de la Esperanza.

We defined 20 parameters including the demographic characteristics, surgery details, subjective benefits, handling and individual factors. The most frequent adverse events (85  %) were skin reactions. The average SRR was 0. 426 per Baha year. Six parameters showed an association with the SRR or the WHG. The clinically most relevant factors are an elevated Body Mass Index (BMI, p =  0. 02) and darker skin type (p =  0. 03). The SRR increased with the distance between the tragus and the implant (p =  0. 02). Regarding the identified risk factors, the SRR might be reduced by selecting a location for the implant near the pinna and by specific counseling regarding post-operative care for patients with darker skin type or an elevated Body Mass Index (BMI). Few of the factors analyzed were found to influence the SRR and WHG. Since most adverse skin reactions could be treated easily with local therapy, our results suggest that in adult patients, individual risk factors for skin reactions are not a contraindication for Baha implantation. Thus, patients can be selected purely on audiological criteria...|$|R
