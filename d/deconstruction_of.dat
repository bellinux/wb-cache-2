5|$|In 1994, Davies quit {{all of his}} {{producing}} jobs, and {{was offered}} a scriptwriting role on the late-night soap opera Revelations, created by him, Tony Wood, and Brian B. Thompson. The series was a tongue-in-cheek <b>deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> organised religion, and featured his first overtly homosexual character: a lesbian vicar portrayed by Sue Holderness, {{who came out of}} the closet in a two-hander episode with Carole Nimmons.|$|E
5|$|Both {{internal}} and external signals {{can lead to the}} induction of apoptosis, or programmed cell death. The resulting <b>deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> cellular components is primarily carried out by specialized proteases known as caspases, but the proteasome also plays important and diverse roles in the apoptotic process. The involvement of the proteasome in this process is indicated by both the increase in protein ubiquitination, and of E1, E2, and E3 enzymes that is observed well in advance of apoptosis. During apoptosis, proteasomes localized to the nucleus have also been observed to translocate to outer membrane blebs characteristic of apoptosis.|$|E
5|$|Neon Genesis Evangelion gained {{widespread}} {{critical acclaim}} {{as well as}} controversy. Regarded as a critique and <b>deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the mecha genre, the series has become a cultural icon and influenced an artistic and technical revival of the anime industry. Subsequent film, manga, home video and other products in the Evangelion franchise have achieved record sales in Japan and strong sales in overseas markets, and by 2007 gross revenues had reached over 150 billion yen. The 1997 film The End of Evangelion, made by the original team of the series, serves as a complementary ending to the series.|$|E

25|$|The Wake <b>of</b> <b>Deconstruction</b> (1994) {{approaches}} the general state <b>of</b> <b>deconstruction</b> in light <b>of</b> the backlash it faced {{over the course}} of the 1980s and early '90s. Through the double lenses of Paul de Man’s posthumous Nazi collaboration scandal and the academic community’s reaction to the murder of feminist legal theorist Mary Joe Frug, Johnson discusses allegory, feminism, and the misinterpretation <b>of</b> <b>deconstruction.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Merzzow is {{an album}} by the Japanese noise {{musician}} Merzbow. The album [...] "combines animal concepts and <b>deconstructions</b> <b>of</b> 20th-century music, ambient drones {{and a deep}} grinding groove". The title is a pun on Merzbow and the Japanese word [...]|$|R
5|$|The {{efficient}} industrial-scale <b>deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> biomass requires novel enzymes {{with higher}} productivity and lower cost. Metagenomic {{approaches to the}} analysis of complex microbial communities allow the targeted screening of enzymes with industrial applications in biofuel production, such as glycoside hydrolases. Furthermore, knowledge of how these microbial communities function is required to control them, and metagenomics is a key tool in their understanding. Metagenomic approaches allow comparative analyses between convergent microbial systems like biogas fermenters or insect herbivores such as the fungus garden of the leafcutter ants.|$|E
5|$|The graphic {{novel was}} the first Batman story to be written by Morrison before {{becoming}} a regular writer in future Batman titles. Inspired by previous works like The Dark Knight Returns, Morrison conceived the story to be his own different approach to the character, using heavy symbolical references and the <b>deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> many iconic Batman villains. The story follows the vigilante Batman, who is called upon to quell a maddening riot {{taking place in the}} infamous Arkham Asylum, a psychiatric hospital housing the most dangerous supervillains in Gotham City. Inside, Batman confronts many of his enduring rogues gallery, such as the Joker, Two-Face, and Killer Croc, many of them having changed since he last saw them. As Batman ventures deeper, he discovers the origin of how the asylum was established, the history of its builder Amadeus Arkham, and the supernatural and psychological mystery that has been haunting the area.|$|E
25|$|The Scottish Maritime Museum {{called for}} tenders for the {{demolition}} or <b>deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> City of Adelaide, which closed on 23 November 2009. <b>Deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the vessel would involve scientific recording and potential preservation of {{sections of the}} ship. CSCOAL submitted a tender, though unlike the other tenders its proposal involved removing the ship as a whole rather than in pieces.|$|E

25|$|Its albums {{generally}} {{fall into}} two categories: <b>deconstructions</b> <b>of</b> Western popular music, and complex conceptual pieces composed around a theme, theory, or plot. The group is noted for surrealistic lyrics and sound, disregard for conventional music composition, and the over-the-top theatrical spectacle of their live performances.|$|R
5000|$|Magnetic viewing film is {{sometimes}} used by hobbyists and electronics enthusiasts to examine commercial products. For example, iFixIt, {{a site that}} publishes [...] "teardowns" [...] (or <b>deconstructions)</b> <b>of</b> new technology, used magnetic-field viewing film in its teardown of the iPad 2 Smart Cover. The film revealed the magnet array inside the cover.|$|R

He is best remembered for the witty <b>deconstructions</b> <b>of</b> the French language which he invented for Sol.|$|R
5000|$|According to Caroline Rosenthal, author <b>of</b> Narrative <b>Deconstructions</b> <b>of</b> Gender in Works by Audrey Thomas, Daphne Marlatt, and Louise Erdich, “Marlatt, in Ana Historic, {{challenges}} the regulatory fiction of heterosexuality. She offers her protagonist {{a way out}} into a new order that breaks with {{the law of the}} father, creating a [...] "monstrous" [...] text that explores the possibilities of a lesbian identity.” ...|$|R

25|$|The Forsyth Barr Building {{survived the}} {{earthquake}} but many occupants were trapped {{after the collapse}} of the stairwells, forcing some to abseil out after the quake.

25|$|Karakasis notes that, {{although}} Eclogue II is {{the only}} poem of Calpurnius that remains faithful to the traditional pastoral song-contest form, it can be construed as a <b>deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the pastoral canon - citing (among other things) the introduction of characters with names unprecedented in previous pastoral poems {{and the use of}} epic, elegiac and georgic allusions, language and imagery.|$|E

50|$|Recently {{there has}} been {{interest}} in how the modern militaries have constructed their knowledge. Military science in modern armed forces {{has taken on the}} aura of a hard science when it is arguably a combination of hard science, sociology ("soft science"), and military history (the humanities). Postmodern <b>deconstructions</b> <b>of</b> the assumptions behind modern military science can be effective in revealing how modern militaries have socially constructed their reality.|$|R
25|$|The {{electromagnetic}} {{theory was}} also {{established in the}} 19th century, and raised new questions which could not easily be answered using Newton's framework. The phenomena {{that would allow the}} <b>deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the atom were discovered in {{the last decade of the}} 19th century: the discovery of X-rays inspired the discovery of radioactivity. In the next year came the discovery of the first subatomic particle, the electron.|$|E
25|$|In {{the most}} general, feminist {{literary}} criticism before the 1970s {{was concerned with}} the politics of women's authorship and the representation of women's condition within literature. Since the arrival of more complex conceptions of gender and subjectivity, feminist literary criticism has taken {{a variety of new}} routes. It has considered gender in the terms of Freudian and Lacanian psychoanalysis, as part of the <b>deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> existing power relations.|$|E
25|$|These various {{proposals}} to separate {{small groups of}} genera into more homogeneous families, made little impact till that of Dahlgren (1985) incorporating new information including synapomorphy. Dahlgren developed Huber's ideas further and popularised them, with a major <b>deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> existing families into smaller units. They created a new order, calling it Asparagales. This was one of five orders within the superorder Liliiflorae. Where Cronquist saw one family, Dahlgren saw forty distributed over three orders (predominantly Liliales and Asparagales).|$|E
5000|$|As {{a school}} of thought, the Yale School is more closely allied with the post-structuralist {{dimensions}} <b>of</b> <b>deconstruction</b> as opposed to its phenomenological dimensions. Additionally, the Yale School is more similar to the 1970s version <b>of</b> <b>deconstruction</b> that John D. Caputo has described as a [...] "Nietzschean free play of signifiers" [...] and not the 1990s version <b>of</b> <b>deconstruction</b> that was far more concerned with political and ethical questions.|$|R

50|$|Popular {{criticism}} <b>of</b> <b>deconstruction</b> also intensified {{following the}} Sokal affair, {{which many people}} took {{as an indicator of}} the quality <b>of</b> <b>deconstruction</b> as a whole, despite the absence of Derrida from Sokal's follow-up book Impostures Intellectuelles.|$|R
25|$|The Scottish Maritime Museum {{found itself}} in a Catch-22 position: the punitive charges arising from their failure to vacate the slipway were now {{sufficient}} to bankrupt the museum, {{but they did not}} have sufficient funds to scientifically deconstruct the vessel. Had the museum gone into administration its nationally significant collection would have been dispersed. The alternative for the Scottish Government was to fund either the <b>deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> City of Adelaide, or her removal from Scotland. A conference was held in December 2009 at which the main stakeholders discussed the possible options for saving the ship.|$|E
25|$|Devil's Brood {{focuses on}} the <b>deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> a royal family. The {{destruction}} was both personal and spilled over to cause war. In the novel, Penman investigates {{the role of a}} strong medieval queen who rebels against her husband. Furthermore, Penman explores the theme of betrayal: Henry II considers the rebellion against him by his sons and wife as personal and political betrayal. Finally, the question of how a man reconciles personal and family needs with the demands of kingship are examined through Henry's actions as father, husband and ruler.|$|E
25|$|In May 2015, it was {{announced}} that further <b>deconstruction</b> <b>of</b> the front and sanctuary areas of the building would be undertaken with a view to investigating the retention of the nave area (which appeared to be relatively undamaged) and its incorporation into a new building. This redevelopment, if it proceeded, would cost about $45 million and take four years to complete. In October 2016, the result of this investigation {{was announced}}. The Cathedral could be saved and gradually rebuilt, but at a cost $100 million. A decision awaits the appointment of the new bishop of Christchurch.|$|E
40|$|In {{this article}} the author juxtaposes two {{different}} attempts of defending life against Heidegger’s horizon of death (Sein zum Tode) (the survie (survival) of Jacques Derrida and the “Living up to Death” of Paul Ricoeur). Their false proximity introduces a new {{insight into the}} discussion about the paradoxical positiveness <b>of</b> <b>deconstruction.</b> Ricoeur’s concept <b>of</b> life makes impossible the understanding <b>of</b> <b>deconstruction</b> as faithfulness to the other not in his identity, but precisely in his otherness...|$|R
