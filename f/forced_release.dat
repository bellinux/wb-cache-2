2500|$|At {{this point}} Haganah {{believed}} that they had accurate information on {{the location of the}} hostages. The information made it {{all the way up to}} the Haganah chief of staff, Yisrael Galili who passed it on to the Haganah high commander and chairman of the Jewish Agency, David Ben-Gurion. Although the Haganah, acting under the Jewish Agency's direction, had at times cooperated with the Irgun and Lehi and carried out anti-British operations, it was at the time conducting the [...] "Little Saison" [...] against the two groups, attempting to suppress their activities by foiling some of their operations. Galili, who was opposed any collaboration with the British, had ordered preparations for a <b>forced</b> <b>release</b> by the Haganah. Ben-Gurion thought that a <b>forced</b> <b>release,</b> no matter by whom, would lead to the hanging of the condemned in Acre, and Irgun's finger would be pointed at the Agency, Haganah and SHAI. He therefore made two decisions: First, the hostages were to be released by force; but not by Haganah, as Galili suggested, but by the British. Second, the information regarding the location of the hostages was to be passed anonymously not only to the British, but to Ben-Ami as well. By doing this he hoped to give the impression that Ben Ami had passed the information to the British. Ben-Gurion was relying on this, plus Ben Ami's call to the Netanya residents [...] "to leave no stone unturned" [...] to attract reprisals from Irgun if the hostages were rescued.|$|E
5000|$|In {{discussions with}} the ICO about the FOIA {{requests}} which Jonathan Jones and Don Keiller had made before the email controversy had begun, the university argued that the data was publicly available from the Met organisations, {{and the lack of}} agreement exempted the remaining data. In its decision released on 23 June 2011, the ICO stated that the data was not easily available and there was insufficient evidence that disclosure would have an adverse effect on international relations. The ICO required the university to release the data covered by the FOIA request within 35 calendar days. On 27 July 2011 CRU announced release of the raw instrumental data not already in the public domain, with the exception of Poland which was outside the area covered by the FOIA request.

5000|$|The Climatic Research Unit {{developed}} its gridded CRUTEM {{data set}} of land air temperature anomalies from instrumental temperature records held by National Meteorological Organisations around the world, often under formal or informal confidentiality agreements that restricted {{use of this}} raw data to academic purposes, and prevented it from being passed onto third parties. Over 95% of the CRU climate data set had been {{available to the public}} for several years before July 2009, when the university received numerous FOI requests for raw data or details of the confidentiality agreements from Stephen McIntyre and readers of his Climate Audit blog. Phil Jones of CRU announced that requests were being made to all the National Meteorological Organisations for their agreement to waive confidentiality, with the aim of publishing all the data jointly with the Met Office. McIntyre complained that data denied to him had been sent to Jones's colleague Peter Webster at the Georgia Institute of Technology for work on a joint publication, and FOI requests for this data were made by Jonathan A. Jones of the University of Oxford and Don Keiller of Anglia Ruskin University. Both requests were refused by the UEA by 11 September 2009.Though some National Meteorological Organisations gave full or conditional agreement to waive confidentiality, others failed to respond, and the request was explicitly refused by Trinidad and Tobago and Poland.

40|$|In {{the comment}} of Dr Konstantopoulos ‘Gogas et al, give no {{information}} {{pertaining to the}} status of melanoma cells circulating in their patients before any surgical manipulation (i. e. at first presentation). In our work (Gogas et al, 2002), in 27 patients tested, one was already positive before operation becoming negative some time following operation ’ we would like to state that more than 95 % of the patients referred to our Center have already been diagnosed with melanoma and require wide local excision, sentinel lymph node and consideration for adjuvant treatment. So, {{it was not possible to}} obtain blood from patients before any surgical manipulation. Perhaps, they should define if this was the case in the 27 patients they studied in the work they have published. Concerning the comment ‘This type of information may permit further confirmation of a theory claiming that surgery manipulations may cause <b>forced</b> <b>release</b> of melanocytes to blood circulation’ in our discussion, we argue that even though this is not a randomised study and there were no untreated patients, and one could speculate that the conversion was a consequence of greater time after surgery, the surgery in this case either dislodging tumour cells or removing the source of tumour cells, the lower probability of recurrence strongly argues that the reversion was a consequence of interferon therapy. Finally, I cannot reconcile why Dr Konstantopoulos believes that ‘for a more reliable conclusion to be drawn, as interferon administration could possibly induce transcription of tyrosinase gene, one should also include subjects under similar doses of interferon for other purposes as controls’. The regiment used in our study is only approved by the FDA for high-risk melanoma patients...|$|E

A previous {{study found that the}} <b>force</b> <b>released</b> by “relaxed” elastomeric ligatures was higher than the new [12].

However, further studies are necessary to evaluate the force after a certain period of performance of elastomeric ligatures.|$|R
