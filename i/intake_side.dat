25|$|A second method called 'continuous blending' is now gaining favor. Oxygen, helium and air are blended on the <b>intake</b> <b>side</b> of a compressor. The {{oxygen and}} helium are {{fed into the}} air stream using flow meters, so as to achieve the rough mix. The low {{pressure}} mixture is analyzed for oxygen content and the oxygen and helium flows adjusted accordingly. On the high pressure side of the compressor a regulator is used to reduce pressure of a sample flow and the trimix is analyzed (preferably for both helium and oxygen) so that the fine adjustment to the intake gas flows can be made.|$|E
25|$|Higher lift allows greater airflow; {{although}} even {{by allowing}} a larger volume of air to pass thru the larger opening, the brevity {{of the typical}} duration with a higher lift cam results in less airflow than with a cam with lower lift but more duration, all else being equal. On forced induction motors this higher lift could yield better results than longer duration, particularly on the <b>intake</b> <b>side.</b> Notably though, higher lift has more potential problems than increased duration, in particular as valve train rpm rises which can result in less efficient running or loss of torque.|$|E
50|$|The Jetta GLI, a sedan {{version of}} the Golf GTI based on the new Jetta, was {{revealed}} at the 2011 Chicago Auto Show with the 2.0 TSI 200 hp engine and a fully independent suspension, {{as well as the}} European Jetta's soft touch materials. A black honeycomb grill, aggressive lower <b>intakes,</b> <b>side</b> adorning foglights, smoked taillights, dual tailpipes, red painted calipers, and red stitching are all elements to separate it from its run-of-the-mill counterpart. The GLI, as well as the Jetta TDI, are the only two trims to receive Volkswagen's 6-speed manual transmission as well as the optional 6-speed DSG gearbox.|$|R

2500|$|A 6-speed manual {{transmission}} became available in 2003 as a 2004 model on the sedan (the coupe {{always had the}} option).

There is speculation that the output did not actually change, and that Infiniti was simply {{taking advantage of the}} outdated SAE standard of rating horsepower. It should, however, be noted that manual transmission cars received a slightly different engine versus those fitted with automatics; manual cars had engines fitted with variable valve timing on both intake and exhaust camshafts, wheres automatic cars only have VVT on the <b>intake</b> <b>side.</b> [...] The G35 is assembled in Tochigi, Tochigi, Japan, and the first G35 was built in January 2002 as a 2003 model.|$|E
