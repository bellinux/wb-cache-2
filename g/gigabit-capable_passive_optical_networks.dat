40|$|International audienceOptical access {{technologies}} allow {{service providers}} to propose high bandwidth services {{in both directions}} (upstream and downstream) and thus to develop values added services. <b>Passive</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Network</b> (PON) technologies offer, in the upstream, a controlled access to a shared media.

Such mechanisms rely on Dynamic Bandwidth Allocation (DBA) procedures that manage bandwidth allocation according to customers requirements. This paper focuses on comparing two such DBA algorithms: Status Reporting (SR) in which the customer explicitly reports its backlog, and Non Status Reporting (NSR) in which the Optical Line Termination (OLT) infers customers' requirements by assessing how previously allocated resources were used.

Euroopan komission rahoittamassa Scalable Advanced Ring-based passive Dense Access Network Architecture (SARDANA) -tutkimusprojektissa tutkitaan seuraavan sukupolven passiivisten optisten liityntäverkojen teknologioita. Projektin päätavoitteena on pienentää passiivisiin optisiin liityntäverkkoihin liittyviä kustannuksia. Tämä diplomityö käsittelee SARDANA-testiverkon standardoimattoman 10 <b>Gigabit-capable</b> <b>Passive</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Network</b> (XGPON) Transmission Convergence (TC) -kerroksen suunnittelua ja ensimmäistä toteutusta optisessa verkkopäätteessä (ONU:ssa). TC-kerros toteuttaa Medium Access Control (MAC) -protokollan. SARDANA XGPON TC (SXGTC) -kerros perustuu standardoituun ITU-T G. 984. 3 <b>Gigabit-capable</b> <b>Passive</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Network</b> (GPON) TC (GTC) -kerroksen [ITU 08] tarjoamaan ratkaisuun mutta eroaa tästä yksityiskohdiltaan. Kaikki SXGTC-kerroksen oleelliset yksityiskohdat peilataan GTC-kerrokseen. Suunniteltu SXGTC-protokolla tukee maksimissaan 9. 95328 Gbps:n symmetrisiä tiedonsiirtonopeuksia. SXGTC-protokolla on optimoitu käsittelemään dataa 8 tavun sanoissa. Ensimmäinen ONU SXGTC-kerroksen toteutus ohjelmoitavassa Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) -piirissä esitellään funktionaalisten lohkojen avulla. Tämän implementaation tiedonsiirtonopeus alasuunnassa on 9. 95328 Gbps 98 %:n kaistatehokkuudella ja yläsuunnassa 2. 48832 Gbps 94. 5 %:n kaistatehokkuudella SARDANA-testiverkkokonfiguraation tapauksessa. With the {{emergence}} of new broadband telecommunication services and constantly increasing bandwidth demand, fixed access network infrastructure is evolving from electrical to optical. The European Commission funded research project Scalable Advanced Ring-based passive Dense Access Network Architecture (SARDANA) researches the next-generation <b>passive</b> <b>optical</b> access <b>network</b> technologies. The main goal of the project is to reduce expenses that are related to <b>passive</b> <b>optical</b> access <b>networks.</b> This master's thesis discusses the design of the non-standardized 10 <b>Gigabit-capable</b> <b>Passive</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Network</b> (XGPON) Transmission Convergence (TC) layer and its first implementation version for <b>Optical</b> <b>Network</b> Unit (ONU) for the SARDANA test network. The SARDANA XGPON TC (SXGTC) layer implements the Medium Access Control (MAC) protocol. The SXGTC layer is based on the standardized solution offered by the ITU-T G. 984. 3 <b>Gigabit-capable</b> <b>Passive</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Network</b> (GPON) TC (GTC) layer recommendation [ITU 08] but differs from it in many details. All the SXGTC layer features are compared to those of the GTC layer. As a result, the SXGTC protocol is able to support operation on up to 9. 95328 Gbps symmetrical transmission rates. The SXGTC layer is optimized for the 8 -byte-word-based data processing. The first ONU SXGTC layer Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) implementation is presented in terms of functional blocks. The implementation supports operation on 9. 95328 Gbps in the downstream offering 98 % bandwidth efficiency and on 2. 48832 Gbps in the upstream offering 94. 5 % bandwidth efficiency for the SARDANA test network configuration...|$|R

40|$|This {{document}} {{describes the}} application of MPLS multi-segment pseudowires (MS-PWs) in a dual-technology environment comprising a <b>Passive</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Network</b> (PON) and an MPLS Packet Switched Network (PSN). PON technology {{may be used in}} mobile backhaul networks to support the end segments closest to the aggregation devices. In these cases, there may be {{a very large number of}} pseudowire (PW) Terminating Provider Edge (T-PE) nodes. The MPLS control plane could be used to provision these end segments, but support for the necessary protocols would complicate the management of the T-PEs and would significantly increase their expense. Alternatively, static, or management plane, configuration could be used to configure the end segments, but the very large number of such segments in a PON places a very heavy burden on the network manager. This document describes how to set up the end segment of an end-toend MPLS PW over a <b>Gigabit-capable</b> <b>Passive</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Network</b> (G-PON) or 10 <b>Gigabit-capable</b> <b>Passive</b> <b>Optical</b> <b>Network</b> (XG-PON) using the G-PON and XG-PON management protocol, <b>Optical</b> <b>Network</b> Termination Management and Control Interface (OMCI).

It is apparent that an efficient medium access control (MAC) protocol is crucial not only to catalyze the utilization of the upstream resources but also to support the GPON encapsulation method (GEM) for multiple services over GPON. A new approach for bandwidth reporting is developed to achieve dynamic awareness of both the changes of ONU queue status and the consequences of previous allocations. In addition, a novel balance transferring mechanism that enables a register and transfer process for successive allocation across multiple frames is presented. By incorporating the new schemes of bandwidth reporting process and the balance transferring mechanism into a frame-based scheduling procedure, an efficient dynamic bandwidth assignment MAC protocol is developed to support differentiated services over GPON.

The protocol enables the optical line terminal to overlap the idle time slots in each packet transmission cycle with a virtual polling cycle to increase the effective transmission bandwidth. Contrasting the new scheme with developed algorithms, network modeling has exhibited significant improvement in channel throughput, mean packet delay, and packet loss rate in the presence of class-of-service and service-level differentiation. In particular, the displayed 34 % increase in the overall channel throughput and 30 times reduction in mean packet delay for service-level 1 and service-level 2 optical network units (ONUs) at accustomed 50 % ONU load constitutes the highest extended-reach GPON performance reported up to date...|$|E
