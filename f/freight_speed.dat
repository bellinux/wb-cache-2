Just north of the latter, a third track diverged to allow trains to bypass the Marble Hill station, in a {{mainland}} section of Manhattan, where passenger trains stop more frequently, allowing a transfer to the nearby subway station. Metro-North rates the tracks in this area as Class 2 under Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) guidelines, allowing a passenger speed limit of 30 mph and a <b>freight</b> <b>speed</b> limit of 15 mph 10 mph below that allowed by the FRA.|$|E
5000|$|In BR {{days there}} were unfitted mineral trains run at express <b>freight</b> <b>speed,</b> locally known as [...] "the Annesley Cutters" [...] or [...] "Windcutters", {{exclusively}} {{running on the}} ex-GC line. These ran from Annesley, a collection yard for the collieries of Nottinghamshire served by the ex Great Central Railway, to Woodford Halse and then onwards to major destinations across southern England. These trains have been recreated on the preserved Great Central Railway, using over 30 of these wagons purchased in 1992 by readers of Steam Railway magazine. Whilst there were many equivalent empty wagon trains run by the Midland/ LMS/ BR LM Region, they were never run at express speeds, nor did they attract any nickname such as Windcutters.|$|E

40|$|As {{rail freight}} reform {{develops}} further, parcels transport {{by the high}} speed rail network is expanding in China. We explore the optimal operational method through case studies. Both France and Germany have operated parcels trains on their high speed networks, at a speed of 270 km/h and 160 km/h respectively; following the literature we consider both as high <b>speed</b> <b>freight</b> trains. The business model, transportation organization and performance are compared between Germany, France and China. The findings of our analysis suggest dedicated high <b>speed</b> <b>freight</b> trains are better than mixed trains at exploiting advantages of high speed railways and achieving economies of scale. However, the sensitivity analysis tells us the dedicated high <b>speed</b> <b>freight</b> train in China will require at least 5 % mode share on the busiest routes like Beijing-Shanghai and Guangzhou-Shanghai and over 30 % on less busy routes like Chengdu-Changsha. From German and French experience, volume guarantees seem crucial for the operation of high <b>speed</b> <b>freight</b> trains. Competitive price {{is also important to}} attract enough volume. The construction of a limited high <b>speed</b> rail <b>freight</b> network on key routes will permit exploitation of economies of scale. Also night trains are a better choice for parcels and mail delivery companies...|$|R
5000|$|The 2-8-8-2 proved {{itself to}} be a capable hauler on {{mountain}} grades, enabling the replacement of several smaller locomotives and hauling longer trains than before. Most of them were not fast; they hauled at drag <b>freight</b> <b>speeds,</b> up to 25 mph. However, the Norfolk & Western Y6 class were designed to run up to 55 mph. The locomotives were adopted by {{a broad spectrum of}} mountain railroads, including the Norfolk & Western, Southern, Virginian, Great Northern, Clinchfield, Denver & Rio Grande, Reading, Western Maryland, Missouri Pacific, Frisco, and the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range Railway. On many railroads, the locomotives of the type were the most powerful on the roster. When built, the 2-8-8-2s of the Western Pacific Railroad were among the most powerful steam locomotives in the world and formed the basis for the later 2-8-8-4 [...] "Yellowstone" [...] type engines used by the Duluth, Missabe and Iron Range.|$|R
30|$|Currently {{the maximum}} <b>freight</b> train <b>speed</b> is 100  km/h but, in Europe, freight trains are {{generally}} operated {{at a much}} lower average speed than inter-urban passenger trains. Many modern wagons and locomotives are designed for 120  km/h, but this speed is achieved only for some special trains. A higher speed will mean higher energy consumption {{but at the same time}} shorter transport time will improve the asset utilisation per unit of time. From a system perspective, more freight trains can be operated in between fast passenger trains, in the day time. The <b>speed</b> of normal <b>freight</b> trains was increased from 80 to 100  km/h, on many European networks, about twenty years ago. Considering this, the TEN-T regulations have set a target of achieving <b>freight</b> train <b>speeds</b> of 100  km/h on all European railways by 2030 [8]. The Europe wide incremental increase of speed can be conducted most economically if and when appropriate infrastructure and rolling stock are adopted.|$|R

5000|$|As stated, {{the general}} track gauge in Britain was [...] In the later 1950s, general track {{maintenance}} standards deteriorated rapidly due to manning difficulties, and <b>freight</b> train <b>speeds</b> increased on some routes. Freight trains consisted {{almost entirely of}} short wheelbase (10 ft) four-wheeled wagons carried on a very stiff elliptical leaf spring suspension, and these wagons showed an alarmingly rapid rate of increase of derailment events.

40|$|The {{model in}} this paper is {{intended}} to explain the choice of transport made by shippers, {{as well as their}} total demand for transportation services. The optimal choice of mode is shown to involve a trade-off among <b>freight</b> rates, <b>speed,</b> dependability (variance in speed) and en-route lossage. It is shown that faster, more dependable service simply reduces the shipper's or receiver's inventories, including his safety stock and his inventory in transit. Hence inventory theory makes possible a direct comparison of the four attributes on which mode selection is based and leads to a model of rational choice in transport demand. The resulting model is suitable for statistical estimation given adequate data. ...|$|R

Depending {{on the type of}} train the locomotive was hauling, the system could be manually switched between three modes of operation: <b>freight</b> train, low <b>speed</b> and high speed passenger train.

50|$|Wickens {{concluded}} that a properly damped suspension system could eliminate the problem, and set about to demonstrate this.

The same work suggested there was no practical upper limit to the achievable speeds in terms of dynamics, and that any limitations on maximum performance would be due to other factors like traction or wear on the lines. Eventually a series of six HSFV designs would be tested until 1976, and the last, HSFV-6, entered service that year.|$|R
