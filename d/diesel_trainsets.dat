5|$|Based on the study, Governor William O'Neill ordered ConnDOT in October 1986 to {{initiate}} rail {{service on the}} corridor. It was established as a temporary service to newly reopened local stations between Union Station in New Haven and Old Saybrook, to alleviate traffic congestion that arose from scheduled construction work on I-95. O'Neill introduced a $50 million transportation program that included $900,000 (later reduced to $500,000) for basic stations and $4 million to refurbish 12 Budd Rail Diesel Cars for rolling stock. The RDCs {{were found to be}} insufficient and two <b>diesel</b> <b>trainsets</b> were purchased from the defunct PATrain service in 1989 instead.

50|$|These {{locomotives}} saw {{service in}} local passenger train service around big cities and on branch lines which could bear the 17.5 ton axle load. They {{were found to}} be economical in service and served well during the short period they spent in service. In the late 1960s and early 1970s, they were ousted by expanding electrification and by diesel locomotives and <b>diesel</b> motor <b>trainsets.</b>|$|R
50|$|When the new {{locomotives}} {{arrived in}} Bulgaria in 1943, they were allocated to Sofia depot. Between 1953 and 1957, five locomotives were relocated to Plovdiv depot {{to serve the}} Plovdiv-Svilengrad line. In addition to the local passenger train service, duties there also included international express trains to and from Turkey. In 1961, the remaining five locomotives were relocated from Sofia to Varna depot. They remained on these local passenger train duties well into the 1970s, when they were ousted by diesel locomotives and <b>diesel</b> <b>trainsets.</b> Some were preserved.|$|E

5000|$|Mantetsu {{intended}} to build steam locomotives for high speed passenger trains in the future, {{and to be}} competitive with the high speeds attained by <b>diesel</b> <b>trainsets,</b> {{they needed to be}} safely operated continuously over long distances. To this end, all bearings were roller bearings from SKF of Sweden to reduce fuel consumption, and the locomotive was designed to make inspection and maintenance as simple as possible, and to maximise the time between maintenance. In addition, the introduction of technically advanced steam locomotives to replace internal-combustion railcars also took into consideration the potential for petroleum shortages in case of war. The streamlining was designed in cooperation with the Kawanishi Aircraft Company {{at the same time as}} the streamlining for the Pashina class locomotive Pashina-12 was designed.|$|E
50|$|In February 2008, the Ghana General News {{reported}} that the Ministry of Harbours and Railways and the Ghana Railway Corporation (GRC) expected to complete a new commuter line linking Accra and Tema by June 2008. The formation was complete from Sakumono to the SSNIT flats near Tema. <b>Diesel</b> multiple-unit <b>trainsets</b> will be imported for use on the line. Construction of sleeper plant for the far north line was also initiated in 2008.|$|R
50|$|Initially, {{the system}} was a {{completely}} diesel network. Because of the {{many different kinds of}} electrical specifications (voltages and current types - alternating current and direct current) used in the different countries it was thought at that time that use of diesel-hauled trains or <b>diesel</b> multiple-unit <b>trainsets</b> would greatly speed up border crossing. Moreover, at that time many border crossing sections were not yet electrified. The German DB built the streamlined DB Class VT 11.5, while the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB) and the Dutch NS developed the RAm / DE, both diesel trains.|$|R
50|$|While most DMUs need {{to comply}} with strict FRA crash {{requirements}} for simultaneous operation with freight railways, European-style DMUs are used with timesharing arrangements on several rail lines, including the RiverLINE in New Jersey. Only a handful of manufacturers in the United States produce or have produced FRA-compliant DMUs, including Colorado Railcar (now US Railcar) and Nippon Sharyo/Sumitomo Corporation. NJ Transit has experimented with this DMU on the Princeton Branch line. In August 2006 {{it was announced that}} Amtrak wants the State of Vermont to experiment with DMUs on the state-subsidized Vermonter line from New Haven north to St. Albans to replace the less efficient <b>diesel</b> locomotive <b>trainsets</b> currently used.|$|R

There was some criticism of the use of Desiros for CFR's long-distance services because they were considered to be uncomfortable. CFR has recently refitted them, and is now using Desiros mainly on its medium- and short-distance routes. For example, it is planning to use them as part of a proposed commuter link in Bucharest and Ilfov county. For more information on routes, see Căile Ferate Române.|$|R

5000|$|According to Time, Malaxa [...] "parlayed {{a shoestring}} into {{a chain of}} arms {{factories}} and a partnership in Rumania's largest iron works". By {{the end of the}} 1930s, the Malaxa factories were mass-producing steam locomotives, <b>diesel</b> locomotives, <b>trainsets,</b> rolling stock, steel pipes, and were one of the biggest industrial groups in Southeastern Europe, and the main provider of equipment for the Romanian Railways during the period. In several of his locomotive designs, Malaxa used innovative solutions (in locomotive design [...] - [...] those developed in by George Constantinescu {{on the basis of his}} theory of sonics; in factory design [...] - [...] in collaboration with Horia Creangă). Owning much of Romania's steel industry through his strong presence in Reşiţa, he was chairman of the Ford Motor Company's Romanian section, and arguably the richest man in Romania at the time.|$|R

Until 31 May 1964 the Oiseau Bleu was part of the joint Dutch-Swiss TEE service provided by RAm-type <b>diesel</b> multiple unit <b>trainsets.</b> The Dutch and Swiss railways scheduled the use of each TEE trainset on a five-day cycle: Day 1 Zürich-Amsterdam (TEE Edelweiss), Day 2 Amsterdam-Paris (TEE Étoile du Nord) in the morning and Paris-Brussels (TEE Oiseau Bleu) in the evening, Day 3 Brussels - Paris (TEE Oiseau Bleu) in the morning and Paris-Amsterdam (TEE Étoile du Nord) in the evening, Day 4 Amsterdam-Zürich (TEE Edelweiss), Day 5 maintenance in Zürich.|$|R
5000|$|During {{its time}} as a TEE, the Mediolanum changed several times from using Italian cars to German ones or vice versa. Originally, it used FS <b>diesel</b> multiple-unit (DMU) <b>trainsets</b> of [...] In 1969, these were {{replaced}} by German (DB) diesel multiple units, of class VT 11.5. In 1972, the train returned to using Italian FS cars, but now electric locomotive-hauled instead of multiple-unit trainsets, with different locomotives over different portions of the route. In summer 1977, the train was once again using DB coaches, remaining locomotive-hauled, but in autumn 1979 it returned to using FS coaches. When the TEE Mediolanum was using Italian cars, its restaurant car was operated by Wagons-Lits, {{and when it was}} using German cars, the restaurant was operated by the German Sleeper and Dining Car Company (DSG).|$|R
50|$|The <b>diesel</b> {{multiple}} unit <b>trainsets</b> were ordered from Sumitomo Corporation of America / Nippon Sharyo {{at a cost}} of $46.7 million, or $6.67 million for each two car set. They were delivered to Rochelle, Illinois for assembling, and then sent to the Transportation Technology Center, Inc. in Pueblo, CO for testing. Under the contract, additional railcars may be ordered {{at a cost of}} $2.9 million per individual car. The first trainset arrived in Cotati, California on April 7, 2015. The original order was for fourteen cars in seven two car trainsets, but on July 30, 2015, the state of California announced an $11 million grant to SMART to finance the purchase of three additional cars {{to be added to the}} fleet, allowing for three trainsets to be run with three cars, with an increase in capacity of 130 passengers over a two car trainset. In April 2016, SMART's general manager negotiated with CalSTA and Nippon Sharyo to adjust the order so SMART will receive two more full trainsets in place of the extra cars, bringing their fleet size to the required nine trainsets needed for service to Cloverdale. They will be painted in a McGlashan green livery.|$|R
5000|$|After the Nara Electric Railway line {{opened in}} 1928, its {{frequency}} {{of service and}} drastically reduced transit time took away much of the demand for through-service between the Tokaido Main Line and the Nara Line. In the 1950s, the Nara Line was among the earliest of the JNR lines to be converted from steam locomotives to <b>diesel</b> multiple unit <b>trainsets,</b> and new stations were opened; after that, however, not much capital was spent on the line, and was not until 1984 that it was finally electrified. In short, it was treated entirely as a local line, {{rather than as an}} intercity commuter corridor. The turning point for the Nara Line was only after Japanese National Railways was privatized, and it became part of the JR West network. An article in the Asahi Shimbun from 1991, the same year as JR announced it would be pumping capital into the Nara Line, described the perceived cause for this sudden interest as follows: [...] "During previous year's string of visits by the new Emperor and Empress, their Majesties arrived in Kyoto via JR Central's Tōkaidō Shinkansen, then immediately boarded the Kintetsu line for Nara, ignoring the local JR West trains entirely." ...|$|R
