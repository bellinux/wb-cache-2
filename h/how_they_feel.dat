5|$|Dragon Quest VII is {{best known}} for its huge size. Without {{completing}} the game's side quests, a single game of Dragon Quest VII can take a hundred hours or more. In terms of gameplay, not much has changed from previous installments; battles are still fought in a turn-based mode from a first person perspective. Although non-battle sequences are rendered in 3D, battles themselves are still portrayed two dimensionally. The ability to talk with the party characters in and outside of battles was added to this game. They offer advice about battle strategies and plot points, or simply comment on <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> at a given moment. There are four ways and means of locomotion: feet, boat, magic carpet, and skystone. Each of these can move across different terrain.|$|E

25|$|When {{comparing}} the sexual self-concepts of adolescent girls and boys, {{researchers found that}} boys experienced lower sexual self-esteem and higher sexual anxiety. The boys stated they were less able to refuse or resist sex at a greater rate than the girls reported having difficulty with this. The authors state {{that this may be}} because society places so much emphasis on teaching girls how to be resistant towards sex, that boys don’t learn these skills and are less able to use them when they want to say no to sex. They also explain how society’s stereotype that boys are always ready to desire sex and be aroused may contribute to the fact that many boys may not feel comfortable resisting sex, because it is something society tells them they should want. Because society expects adolescent boys to be assertive, dominant and in control, they are limited in <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> it is appropriate to act within a romantic relationship. Many boys feel lower self-esteem when they can’t attain these hyper-masculine ideals that society says they should. Additionally, there is not much guidance on how boys should act within relationships and many boys {{do not know how to}} retain their masculinity while being authentic and reciprocating affection in their relationships. This difficult dilemma is called the double-edged sword of masculinity by some researchers.|$|E

Then, certain participants were chosen to forecast <b>how</b> <b>they</b> would <b>feel</b> if <b>they</b> were chosen or not chosen for the job immediately after learning if they had been hired or fired and then they had to predict <b>how</b> <b>they</b> would <b>feel</b> ten minutes after hearing the news.

All participants were then required to fill out a questionnaire that reported their current happiness.

[...] Benioff continued about Brienne's escape, [...] "It's these two who are not quite sure <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> about the other, and he lets her go. He'd be well within his rights to send his men after her, to capture her, and it wouldn't be that hard to capture her since she's being slowly rowed away by Podrick, but he doesn't. She might technically be an enemy now that she's serving Sansa Stark, who is still obviously a suspect in Joffrey's murder, but she's not Jaime's enemy." ...|$|E

[...] Watkins then shared this to the group's long-time writer-producer Dallas Austin, who she had known and with whom she had shared many stories since the two were teenagers. [...] "We thought that was a good relationship to talk about because a lot of people don't admit that's <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> – that their man's playing on them and they want to be with him so they seek attention elsewhere, but they really want to be with their guy," [...] she added.|$|E

Some people, the music connected with them so strongly, their opinions, <b>how</b> <b>they</b> <b>feel</b> about it... It’s amazing that they have such a connection {{but they seem to}} act like it happened to them. This happened to us and Layne’s family, not them. This is actually our lives. If we’re okay with it, why can’t you be? This happened to us, this didn’t happen to you. But this album isn’t about that, it’s a bigger universal point. We’re all going to fucking die, we’re all going to lose somebody, and it fucking hurts. How do you move on? This record is us moving on, and hurting. That, to me, is a victory. I already feel like I’ve won." [...] "Sometimes people ask us, ‘Wouldn’t Layne have been pissed off that we did this?’ And I tell them {{it would have been the}} opposite: he would have been pissed off that it took us so long to do this. We’re not doing this for money; there is no money in the music business anymore. Jerry and I funded the whole album, and we spent lots of our own money, because we believe in this. And one of the reasons I’m doing this is so more light is turned on to something where the light was turned off." [...] And Cantrell added: [...] "We’ve toured around the world, we’ve lost some friends, we buried a dear friend, and somebody that you just can’t fucking replace, and then we’ve chosen by circumstance to get together again. That turned into ‘maybe we can fucking do this.’ And that turned into this".|$|E
