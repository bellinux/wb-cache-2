40|$|Fair-division {{problems}} are ubiquitous. They {{range from the}} day-to-day chore assignments to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and include the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inheritance</b> to the heirs (Brams & Taylor, 1999; Massoud, 2000). Many intuitive and self-implementable algorithms guaranteeing “fairness ” have been devised in the past 50 years (Brams & Taylor, 1996). So far, very few empirical studies have put them to the test (Daniel & Parco, 2005; Schneider & Krämer, 2004). In fact, {{it is not even}} known to what extent the solutions derived from these algorithms are satisfactory to human players. Here, we present an experiment that investigated the satisfaction of two pairs of players who divided 10 indivisible goods between themselves. A genetic algorithm was used to search for the best division candidates. Results show that some of the best divisions found by the genetic algorithm were rated as more mutually satisfactory than the ones derived from six typical fair-division algorithms. Analyses on temporal fluctuation and non-additivity of preferences could partially explain this result. Ideas for the future implementation of a more flexible and unconstrained approach are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} {{data collection}} owner. The main {{objective of this}} research project is to understand how people negotiate and what aspects of the situation they use {{as an aid to}} reach an agreement. Any aspect of a bargaining situation that helps bargainers to coordinate their expectations and behaviour so as to reach an agreement is called a 'focal point'. The purpose of this research is to extend our knowledge about focal points in bargaining situations. There are two sub-projects: In some bargaining situations, such as the division of land, allocation of mineral deposits or oil fields, or the <b>division</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inheritance,</b> there may be no division of the valuable resource that equates money earnings and there may be no equitable outcome. What aspects, if any, become focal in such situations? In many bargaining situations negotiators are not sure about how much others stand to gain from any given agreement. How does the absence of such information influence the focality of various divisions of the resource? Real bargaining situations are complex {{and it is difficult to}} find 'clean' data that allows one to isolate the role of particular factors on the observed bargaining behaviour. We shall therefore use lab experiments. This allows us to isolate the role played by a variable of interest while controlling for the influence of other potential factors...|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} effect <b>of</b> {{receiving}} <b>an</b> <b>inheritance</b> on {{the labor force}} participation (LFP) of both the recipient and the recipient's spouse in <b>a</b> population <b>of</b> older married couples. An inheritance {{is not subject to}} laws governing <b>division</b> <b>of</b> marital property at divorce, because it is not acquired with income earned during marriage. Hence it plays the role <b>of</b> <b>a</b> "distribution factor" in the intrahousehold allocation of resources, increasing bargaining power of the recipient. Controlling for inheritance expectations, we interpret the receipt <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inheritance</b> as <b>a</b> shock to wealth. Our results indicate that receiving <b>an</b> <b>inheritance</b> reduces LFP <b>of</b> the recipient by four percentage points, comparable in magnitude to the effect <b>of</b> <b>a</b> decline in health. However, <b>an</b> <b>inheritance</b> has little or no effect on LFP of the spouse. These estimates are inconsistent with a dynamic, collective model of the household in which spouses have the ability to commit to an ex ante efficient allocation. The results are consistent with <b>a</b> model <b>of</b> limited commitment in which a shock to household resources can alter bargaining power. We discuss the implications for reform of Social Security spouse and survivor benefits...|$|R
40|$|C++ {{is often}} {{described}} as an object-oriented programming language because of its strong support for classes with multiple inheritance and polymorphism. However, for <b>a</b> growing community <b>of</b> numerical programmers, <b>an</b> equally important feature of C++ is its support of operator overloading on value-semantic classes. The union of these two techniques results in a programming style which we choose to call object-oriented numerics. The object-oriented numerics paradigm emphasizes the distinction between polymorphic classes and value-semantic classes. Polymorphic classes are generally high-level, are part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inheritance</b> hierarchy, and have <b>an</b> interface <b>of</b> named functions based on message passing. Value-semantic classes are generally low-level, are not part <b>of</b> <b>an</b> <b>inheritance</b> hierarchy (but may form a conversion hierarchy), and have <b>a</b> public interface <b>of</b> overloaded operators based on an algebra. Numerical codes are best structured as <b>a</b> set <b>of</b> polymorphic classes which use value-seman [...] ...|$|R
