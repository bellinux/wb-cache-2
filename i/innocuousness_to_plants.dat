40|$|As the {{knowledge}} about the interferences of nanomaterials on human staminal cells are scarce and contradictory, we undertook a comparative multidisciplinary study based on the size effect of zero-valent iron, cobalt, and nickel microparticles (MPs) and nanoparticles (NPs) using human adipose stem cells (hASCs) as a model, and evaluating cytotoxicity, morphology, cellular uptake, and gene expression. Our results suggested that the medium did not influence the cell sensitivity but, surprisingly, the iron microparticles (FeMPs) resulted in being toxic. These data were supported by modifications in mRNA expression of some genes implicated in the inflammatory response. Microscopic analysis confirmed that NPs, mainly internalized by endocytosis, persist in the vesicles without any apparent cell damage. Conversely, MPs are not internalized, and the effects on hASCs have to be ascribed {{to the release of}} ions in the culture medium, or to the reduced oxygen and nutrient exchange efficiency due to the presence of MP agglomerating around the cells. Notwithstanding the results depicting a heterogeneous scene that does not allow drawing a general conclusion, this work reiterates the importance of comparative investigations on MPs, NPs, and corresponding ions, and the need to continue the thorough verification of NP and MP <b>innocuousness</b> <b>to</b> ensure unaffected stem cell physiology and differentiation...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-based approach for competitive analysis of manufacturing {{plants in the}} U. S. food processing industry. As part of this approach, plant competitiveness is measured using Operational Competitiveness Ratings Analysis (OCRA) [...] a new non-parametric method of computing relative inefficiency. Drivers of competitiveness are identified in terms of policies related <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> structure and infrastructure. Policies related <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> structure are those decisions that are related with "bricks and mortar" and have long term implications, such as decisions related <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> size and capacity. Policies related <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> infrastructure are decisions related to how the " bricks and mortar" are used. These policies are typically under the direct control of the operations managers and have a short-term orientation, such as decisions related to equipment, quality, inventory, workforce and confusion-engendering activities (e. g. new product introductions and product variety). The empirical analysis is based on detailed cross-sectional data on 20 processed food manufacturing <b>plants.</b> With respect <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> structure, {{the results suggest that}} small sized food processing plants are competitive, and both capacity underutilization and overutilization are detrimental <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> competitiveness. Among the significant results with respect <b>to</b> <b>plant</b> infrastructure, equipment maintenance, quality management programs, packaging supplies inventory, workforce training and product variety are positively associated with plant competitiveness. The results also suggest that introduction of new products disrupts plant operations, {{at least in the short}} run, and is negatively associated with plant competitiveness. ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the olfactory responses of 3 thrips species [Frankliniella schultzei Trybom, F. occidentalis Pergrande and Thrips tabaci Lindeman (Thysanoptera: Thripidae) ] to cotton seedlings [Gossypium hirsutum L. (Malvales: Malvaceae) ] simultaneously damaged by different combinations of herbivores. Cotton seedlings were damaged by foliar feeding Tetranychus urticae Koch (Trombidiforms: Tetranychidae), Helicoverpa armigera Hübner (Lepidoptera: Noctuidae), Aphis gossypii Glover (Hemiptera: Aphididae) or root feeding Tenebrio molitor L. (Coleoptera: Tenebrionidae). Thrips responses <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> simultaneously damaged by 2 species of herbivore were additive and equivalent to {{the sum of the}} responses of thrips <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> damaged by single herbivore species feeding alone. For example, F. occidentalis was attracted to T. urticae damaged plants but more attracted <b>to</b> undamaged <b>plants</b> than <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> damaged by H. armigera. Plants simultaneously damaged by low densities of T. urticae and H. armigera repelled F. occidentalis but as T. urticae density increased relative to H. armigera density, F. occidentalis attraction <b>to</b> coinfested <b>plants</b> increased proportionally. Thrips tabaci did not discriminate between undamaged plants and plants damaged by H. armigera but were attracted <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> damaged by T. urticae alone or simultaneously damaged by T. urticae and H. armigera. Olfactometer assays showed that simultaneous feeding by 2 herbivores on a plant can affect predator–prey interactions. Attraction of F. occidentalis <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> damaged by its T. urticae prey was reduced when the plant was simultaneously damaged by H. armigera, T. molitor, or A. gossypii and F. schultzei was more attracted <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> simultaneously damaged by T. urticae and H. armigera than <b>to</b> <b>plants</b> damaged by T. urticae alone. We conclude that <b>plant</b> responses <b>to</b> feeding by 1 species of herbivore are affected by responses to feeding by other herbivores. These plant-mediated interactions between herbivore complexes affect the behavioral responses of thrips which vary between species and are highly context dependent...|$|R
