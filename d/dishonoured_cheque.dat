Currently the Enforcement Directorate is seeking Interpol to raise an international arrest warrant against Mallya. Also, the High Court of Judicature at Hyderabad issued a non-bailable warrant against Mallya on 13 March 2016 for his failure to appear in the court regarding an allegation of cheating the GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd by issuing them a <b>dishonoured</b> <b>cheque</b> for [...]|$|E
5000|$|A <b>dishonoured</b> <b>cheque</b> {{cannot be}} {{redeemed}} for its value and is worthless; {{they are also}} known as an RDI (returned deposit item), or NSF (non-sufficient funds) cheque. Cheques are usually dishonoured because the drawer's account has been frozen or limited, or because there are insufficient funds in the drawer's account when the cheque was redeemed. A cheque drawn on an account with insufficient funds {{is said to have}} bounced and may be called a rubber cheque. [...] Banks will typically charge customers for issuing a <b>dishonoured</b> <b>cheque,</b> and in some jurisdictions such an act is a criminal action. A drawer may also issue a stop on a cheque, instructing the financial institution not to honour a particular cheque.|$|E
50|$|We {{prefer to}} carry {{a small piece of}} paper known as Cheque rather than {{carrying}} the currency worth the value of the Cheque. Before 1988 there being no provision to restrain the person issuing the Cheque without having sufficient funds in his account. Of course on <b>Dishonoured</b> <b>cheque</b> there is a civil liability accrued. In order to ensure promptitude and remedy against the defaulters of the Negotiable Instrument a criminal remedy of penalty was inserted in Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881 by amending it with Negotiable Instruments Act, 1988.|$|E
50|$|It {{also needed}} to address the process for <b>dishonoured</b> <b>cheques,</b> as cheques {{could no longer be}} returned. A typical solution, as defined by the Monetary Authority of Singapore for the Singapore cheque {{truncation}} system, was that a special 'Image Return Document' was created and sent back to the bank that had truncated the cheque.|$|R
50|$|In the United Kingdom, {{in common}} with other items such as Direct Debits or {{standing}} orders, <b>dishonoured</b> <b>cheques</b> can be reported on a customer's credit file, although not individually and this does not happen universally amongst all banks. Dishonoured payments from current accounts can be marked {{in the same manner}} as missed payments on the customer's credit report.|$|R
5000|$|Because of his revelations, Boukhari {{had many}} {{problems}} with the justice in Morocco. Including defamation lawsuits by former employees of the DST and the Moroccan Ministry of the Interior, whom he mentioned by name in his book, {{as well as other}} common affairs such as <b>dishonoured</b> <b>cheques,</b> which were claimed to be used against him in order to sentence him in a non-political affair.|$|R
50|$|Cheque {{clearing}} (or {{check clearing}} in American English) or bank clearance {{is the process}} of moving a cheque from the bank in which it was deposited to the bank on which it was drawn, and the movement of the money in the opposite direction. This process is called the clearing cycle and normally results in a credit to the account at the bank of deposit, and an equivalent debit to the account at the bank on which it was drawn. If there was not enough funds in the account when the cheque arrived at the issuing bank, the cheque would be returned as a <b>dishonoured</b> <b>cheque</b> marked as non-sufficient funds.|$|E
5000|$|Once {{called the}} [...] "King of Good Times" [...] {{due to his}} extravagant lifestyle, Mallya and his {{companies}} have been embroiled in financial scandals, and controversies since 2012. Mallya left India on 2 March 2016 after saying he wanted to move to Britain {{to be closer to}} his children. A group of 17 Indian banks are trying to collect approximately [...] in loans which Mallya has allegedly routed to gain 100% or a partial stake in about 40 companies across the world. Several agencies including the Income Tax Department and the Central Bureau of Investigation are investigating Mallya for charges including financial fraud and money laundering, and the Attorney General said that Mallya's assets abroad are [...] "far in excess to loans taken by him". The 17 banks added a joint petition at the Supreme Court of India in March 2016 to try to prevent Mallya from leaving the country, but the Indian government indicated that he had already left. The Enforcement Directorate of India also filed a money laundering case against him in March 2016 for allegedly sending abroad some [...] that had been loaned to his airline. On 24 April 2016, the Ministry of External Affairs (India) revoked Mallya's passport, and he resigned from the Rajya Sabha on 2 May 2016, the day before the Ethics Committee of the Rajya Sabha was prepared to recommend his expulsion.

TD Bank, a case {{involving}} the return of across border <b>dishonoured</b> <b>cheque</b> by a Canadian drawee bank, the article addresses issues relating to the presentment and payment of cheques in Canada. It deals with compliance with the statutory requirements for presentment in {{the context of}} CPA clearing rules, and further discusses the legal implications of the treatment of a cheque processed in the clearing. The article argues that a delayed return of a cheque by the drawee bank constitutes 2 ̆ 2 payment 2 ̆ 2 of the cheque that benefits the depositor vis-a-vis the collecting bank, though not the drawee bank...|$|E
50|$|The banker, Lord Port Scatho, arrives. His nephew, Brownlie, who is {{infatuated}} with Sylvia, has unfairly and humiliatingly <b>dishonoured</b> Tietjens' <b>cheques</b> to his army Mess and his club.

5000|$|With the {{insertion}} of these provisions in the Act the situation certainly improved and the instances of dishonour have relatively come down but on account of application of different interpretative techniques by different High Courts on different provisions of the Act it further compounded and complicated the situation although on <b>dishonour</b> of <b>cheques</b> the trends of the verdicts of the Supreme Court of India ...|$|R
5000|$|With the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War Ensor was attached to the adjutant general's staff, as part of the British Expeditionary Force. As the force withdrew, Ensor was placed in charge of evacuating wounded soldiers and civilians through the port of Boulogne. On his return to London he was granted sick leave from the army. In September 1940 he was court martialled on twenty-nine charges: he was acquitted of scandalous conduct unbecoming the character of an officer and a gentleman, of absenting himself without leave, and of leaving his pistol and ammunition unguarded; but was found guilty of thirteen charges involving the use of <b>dishonoured</b> <b>cheques</b> leading to [...] "the prejudice of good order and military discipline". During the trial it emerged that while officially on sick leave Ensor had been entertaining a number of women and leading an extravagant lifestyle which {{he did not have the}} funds to support. He resigned as clerk of the peace, and the incident effectively ended his legal career in England.|$|R
50|$|Horner's single term in {{parliament}} was mired in financial scandal: {{at the end}} of 1900 Horner formed Mayfair Printing & Publishing Limited, a company to which he assigned the copyright and goodwill of the Whitehall Review. In 1902 and 1903 Henry Labouchère, Liberal MP for Northampton alleged that Horner had obtained cash or credit from a number of hotels on the Continent using company cheques which were not honoured by the bank. In November 1905 Labouchère published further allegations in his periodical Truth. These detailed five more <b>dishonoured</b> company <b>cheques</b> cashed by Horner in Monaco, France and Switzerland, totalling in excess of 500 pounds. Horner launched libel proceedings against the magazine without success.|$|R
5000|$|Following {{concerns}} {{about the amount of}} time it took the Cheque and Credit Clearing Company to clear cheques, the United Kingdom Office of Fair Trading set up a working group in 2006 to look at the cheque clearing cycle. Their report said that clearing times could be improved, but that the costs associated with speeding up the cheque clearing cycle could not be justified considering the use of cheques was declining. [...] However, they concluded the biggest problem was the unlimited time a bank could take to <b>dishonour</b> a <b>cheque.</b> To address this, changes were implemented so that the maximum time after a cheque was deposited that it could be dishonoured was six days, what was known as the [...] "certainty of fate" [...] principle.|$|R
50|$|However, it is {{impossible}} to predict when the cheque will be deposited after it is drawn. Because the funds represented by a cheque are not transferred until the cheque is deposited and cleared, it is possible the drawer's account may not have sufficient funds to honour the cheque when the transfer finally occurs. This <b>dishonoured</b> or 'bounced' <b>cheque</b> is now worthless and the payee receives no money, which is why cheques are less secure than cash.|$|R
50|$|Soon {{it became}} {{difficult}} for the airline to follow the much smaller schedule that it earlier released as even more pilots began to go on strike. A pilot later claimed that from 12 March, about 80% of the pilots would not fly as they mentioned in their letter to Vijay Mallya. The airline's plans on restarting all services by 4 April did not seem too real at the moment. On 12 October 2012 an income tax court in Hyderabad issued a non-bailable warrant against Kingfisher Airlines and its chairman Vijay Mallya {{in a case of}} 'bouncing' cheques filed by GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd (GHIAL). The case pertains to bouncing of cheques worth Rs 100 million issued by Kingfisher Airlines to GMR as Hyderabad airport charges.GMR Hyderabad International Airport Ltd, which manages the Rajiv Gandhi International Airport, had earlier moved the Nampally criminal court in Hyderabad and filed a case against Kingfisher for <b>dishonouring</b> four <b>cheques</b> worth Rs 105 million. On 20 October 2012, Kingfisher's licence was suspended by the Directorate General of Civil Aviation after it failed to address the Indian regulator's concerns about its operations.|$|R
5000|$|A payee that {{accepts a}} cheque will {{typically}} deposit {{it in an}} account at the payee's bank, and have the bank process the cheque. In some cases, the payee will take the cheque to {{a branch of the}} drawee bank, and cash the cheque there. If a cheque is refused at the drawee bank (or the drawee bank returns the cheque to the bank that it was deposited at) because there are insufficient funds for the cheque to clear, it is said that the <b>cheque</b> has been <b>dishonoured.</b> Once a <b>cheque</b> is approved and all appropriate accounts involved have been credited, the cheque is stamped with some kind of cancellation mark, such as a [...] "paid" [...] stamp. The cheque is now a cancelled cheque. Cancelled cheques are placed in the account holder's file. The account holder can request a copy of a cancelled cheque as proof of a payment. This is known as the cheque clearing cycle.|$|R
40|$|Image Clearing is {{refers to}} honour or <b>dishonour</b> a <b>cheque</b> by scrutinizing its image not the {{physical}} cheque. In Sri Lanka physical cheque {{was replaced by}} the Image in 2005. This is expediting the payment and settlement system in the banking sector. The Lanka Clear Pvt Ltd - LCPL whose shareholders are the Central Bank of Sri Lanka-CBSL and all commercial banks in Sri Lanka, coordinates the cheque payment system within the banks/branches. Banking is almost solely depending on the effective clearing cycle of the country. As far as the People's Bank is concern it's inward clearing is done in the branch network by individual branches. It has made huge amount of operational and maintenance cost to the bank.

The concerned project is intended to interface with the Core Banking System and separately implemented Signature Verification System. The overseas vendor to the both software will be facilitating to interface with said systems using a message format. Viewing cheques by the customers which are presented for clearing in the same day will be done in web base and it is considered as a value added service. Furthermore the system makes a convenient way for forwarding cheque details to the Branch Manager, necessity arises though centrally process the clearing. Few image processing is involved in the system when it correct the inward clearing misread data in the Digital Versatile Disk- DVD which is submitted by the LCPL. The system has covered all the specifications except "Correcting Inward Data" using OCR - Optical Character Recognition. As far as the user evaluation is concerned which was done using an evaluation form, the software solution has achieved success. Moderate experience in software process, fed up with the rework, time management and interface with other systems were the main problems encountered during the project.
