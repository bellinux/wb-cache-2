40|$|Objectives: To {{estimate}} {{the magnitude of}} intergenerational continuities in total and <b>effective</b> <b>fertility</b> among women {{in a group of}} 46 contemporary developing countries. Methods: Information collected from 93, 000 women aged 45 – 49 for estimation of maternal mortality in the demographic and health surveys (DHS) program is analyzed using Pearson product moment intergenerational fertility correlations. Results: A positive but usually small intergenerational correlation is found for both completed fertility (CFS, total number of children born) and <b>effective</b> <b>fertility</b> (EFS, number of children surviving to age of reproduction). Although the developing countries are mainly located in sub-Saharan Africa, a similar pattern appears to hold for the Asian and Latin American countries included. Women in the second generation with no education have a stronger relationship with their parents' fertility than women with some education. The relationship is also stronger in rural than in urban areas and in countries with lower levels of development. Conclusions: Intergenerational correlations of completed fertility in both generations are marginally stronger than for <b>effective</b> <b>fertility</b> largely because the number of a woman's total sibs is more strongly related to her subsequent childbearing than her number of adult sibs. Values of intergenerational correlations for these countries are similar to published values for a number of Western pretransitional populations, but well below values in contemporary developed societies...|$|E
30|$|Human {{families}} include parents, children, {{grandchildren and}} lasting pair bonds between usually unrelated spouses, so that families typically encompass {{at least three}} family generations and two kin lineages [1].

40|$|Purpose of review: This article {{sets out}} to review the {{literature}} on gonadal toxicity of bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in women, and preventive and curative actions available for girls and women facing BMT and infertility. Findings: The real incidence of ovarian damage after BMT is difficult to assess. Series reporting ovarian function and pregnancies after BMT vary greatly in terms of endpoints, number of patients included, age at and indications for BMT, conditioning regimens and duration of follow-up. The risk of premature ovarian failure (POF) is very high, however, and increases with age and in case of BMT conditioning treatment with total body irradiation.

40|$|Traditional human {{societies}} are organised around kinship, and use kinship networks to generate large scale community projects. This {{is made possible}} by a combination of linguistic kin recognition, a uniquely human trait, which is mediated by the reliability of kin as collaborators. When <b>effective</b> <b>fertility</b> falls, this results in two simultaneous effects on social networks: there are fewer kin that can be relied on, and the limiting effect of the local kin-clustering becomes stronger. To capture this phenomenon, we used a model of kinship lineages to build populations with a range of fertility levels combined with a behavioural synchrony model to measure the efficiency of collective action generated on kin networks within populations. Our findings suggest that, whenever effective cooperation depends on kinship, falling fertility creates a crisis when it results in too few kin to join the community project. We conclude that, when societies transition to small effective kin networks, due to falling fertility, increased relative distance to kin due to urbanisation or high mortality due to war or epidemics, {{they will be able to}} remain socially cohesive only if they replace disappearing kin networks with quasi-kin alternatives based on membership of guilds or clubs...|$|E

While this latter field of research is still in its stage of infancy, it holds great promise for investigating germ cell development and studying the genetic and physiopathological mechanisms of infertility.

The Fourth Evian Annual Reproduction Workshop Meeting was held in April 2009 to discuss cancer and fertility in young adults. Specialists in oncology, assisted reproduction, embryology and clinical genetics presented published data and ongoing research on cancer and fertility, with particular focus on strategies to preserve fertility.

Embryo cryopreservation is the only established method of female fertility preservation. Oocyte cryopreservation offers a useful option for women without a male partner. Emergency ovarian stimulation and cryopreservation of ovarian tissue (followed by tissue transplantation or in-vitro maturation of oocytes) are experimental techniques for women who require urgent cancer treatment. Further prospective studies are required to validate cryopreservation of oocytes and ovarian tissue, in-vitro maturation of oocytes and new vitrification techniques and to identify any long-term sequelae of slow freezing of embryos.

40|$|Progress in the {{empowerment}} of Arab women {{was found to be}} low in a 2002 report. Yet Arab women's status is not reflected in continuing high fertility, which in 2000 had dropped sharply in one generation to 3. 4. This paper discusses why fertility decline could nevertheless hove taken place in the Arab countries. Islam has not stood in the way of fertility decline, as Iran and Algeria show. From the mid- 1970 s to 1980 s, subsidised consumption through oil wealth redistribution reduced the cost of children, and social conservatism kept married women out of the labour force, both of which promoted higher fertility. The early stages of fertility decline were mainly due to longer length of education of girls, rising female age at first marriage, e. g. 28 in urban Morocco and 29 in Libya, and entry into the labour force of young, single women. There is also a growing population sub-group of never-married young women. Collapsing oil prices and structural adjustment reduced household resources and become an <b>effective</b> <b>fertility</b> regulation factor. Girls born since the 1950 s have not only been educated longer than their mothers, but also their fathers, which increases their authority.

40|$|Young {{women who}} suffer from cancer have a high change of {{becoming}} infertile {{as a consequence of}} the treatment. They would benefit from an <b>effective</b> <b>fertility</b> preservation method that allows natural conception. A new method, called autotransplantation of ovarian tissue, has much potential but improvements can be made. The method entails that ovarian tissue is harvested before treatment and frozen until future use. When the patient is in remission the tissue is transplanted back into the patient, which will allow the patient to become pregnant in a natural way. In order to improve the success rate and facilitate further research, a new technique for harvesting ovarian fragments was researched. The goal of this study was to develop a technique to harvest ovarian tissue fragments with controlled dimensions in a minimally invasive way. The technique had to satisfy two functions, namely holding the ovary and removing a tissue fragment. A concept technique was developed where suction was used to hold the ovary and a knife was used to cut a tissue fragment with an impulse. An experimental set-up was developed to test this concept technique. The use of the set-up with chicken filet showed a proof of principle. The efficacy of the concept technique was proven, as well as the accuracy and precision of the length of the obtained fragments. However, the set-up was not effective in producing fragments origination from ovarian tissue. Suggestions for future research include the use of active suction to hold the ovary and a reciprocating knife to cut a tissue fragment.

This laboratory-based study is the first to report on the effects of using fertility compounds on an outbreaking rodent pest species found throughout sub-Saharan Africa. Mastomys natalensis were fed bait containing the synthetic steroid hormones quinestrol and levonorgestrel, both singly and in combination, at three concentrations (10, 50, 100 ppm) for seven days. Consumption of the bait and animal body mass was mostly the same between treatments when analysed by sex, day and treatment. However, a repeated measures ANOVA indicated that quinestrol and quinestrol+levonorgestrel treatments reduced consumption by up to 45 %, particularly at the higher concentrations of 50 and 100 ppm.

In this study 9 garden rose genotypes were selected from a company database as high fertile or low fertile male parents, according {{to the number of}} seeds per hybridization. Pollen morphology and in vitro germination of the selected genotypes were characterized. Pollen was either small (mean diameter = 30 urn), shrunken, and irregular (abnormal), or large (mean diameter = 30 urn), elliptical and crossed by furrows (normal). High correlations were found between the number of seeds produced per hybridization and the pollen diameter (r = 0. 94) or the percentage of normal pollen (r = 0. 96). In order to evaluate the predictive power of the models, we conducted regression analyses and performed a validation experiment on genotypes not present in the database and without background information on fertility.

Validation with an independent dataset gave a good prediction for 83. 3 % of the data.

40|$|The {{past century}} has seen {{striking}} changes in family formation in Ireland. Family dynamics are fundamental aspects of social change, {{but they have}} been neglected by social research in Ireland since the 1970 s. This thesis draws on already available national data to study movements into marriage and parenthood in detail and thereby improve our understanding of family dynamics. The research focuses, in the main, on the 1926 to 1991 census period; a period characterised by the transition from high rates of nonmarriage and large family sizes to more standard European levels. The study primarily addresses the class dimension of family formation. Social class remains a strong predictor of marriage and fertility patterns. The study first maps the long-standing trend of higher rates of non-marriage and higher rates of marital fertility in the poorer sections of Irish society. The fertility levels of the class categories experiencing economic marginalisation have remained high so that the burden of dependency is heaviest among working class and farming families. Fertility decline was, however, evident in all socio-economic groups. Secondly, the thesis provides the first serious examination of quantitative evidence to assess the hypothesis that high rates of marital fertility act as a marriage deterrent. Despite the availability of more <b>effective</b> <b>fertility</b> controls, marriage plans continue to be influenced {{by the size of the}} prospective family. The results highlight the importance of economic resources as a prerequisite to marriage. Economic rationality is not, however, the only driving force. Thirdly, the thesis investigates the degree to which changes in family formation were related to changes in the composition of Irish society. A standardisation exercise isolating the effects of population structure revealed that class compositional changes cannot account for changes in male fertility rates over the course of the twentieth century but, were important in understanding declining rates of celibacy. </p...|$|E
