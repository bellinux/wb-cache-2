Stabilization of MB-NCSs is studied using feedback controls and simulation of stabilization for <b>different</b> <b>feedbacks</b> {{is made with}} the purpose to reduce the network trafic. The feedback control input is applied in a compensated model of the plant that approximates the plant dynamics and stabilizes the plant even under slow network conditions.

Watt's lab has studied β-catenin by fusing it to a mutant oestrogen receptor. Through this process, timing {{and location of}} activation of β-catenin can be controlled.

50|$|The {{elasticity}} {{concept has}} also been described by other authors, most notably Savageau in Michigan and Clarke at Edmonton. In the late 1960s Michael Savageau developed an innovative approach called biochemical systems theory that uses power-law expansions to approximate the nonlinearities in biochemical kinetics. The theory {{is very similar to}} metabolic control analysis and has been very successfully and extensively used to study the properties of <b>different</b> <b>feedback</b> and other regulatory structures in cellular networks. The power-law expansions used in the analysis invoke coefficients called kinetic orders which are equivalent to the elasticity coefficients.|$|E
40|$|A {{preliminary}} {{study on the}} role of torque feedback in the steering wheel was conducted on the Clio dynamic driving simulator at RENAULT. An experiment comparing <b>different</b> torque <b>feedback</b> strategies was conducted to evaluate the potential of driving simulators in the study of future steer-by-wire systems. The results indicate that drivers on the simulator can control their vehicles in curves with quite <b>different</b> torque <b>feedback</b> strategies, either linear or non-linear. However, zero torque or inverted torque feedback makes driving almost impossible. These observations confirm the essential role of coherent haptic information for driving real cars and simulators, and also suggest the existence of driver adaptation mechanisms in steering control...|$|R
40|$|In {{an earlier}} study {{it was found that}} drivers can adjust quickly to <b>different</b> force <b>feedback</b> levels on the {{steering}} wheel, even for such extreme levels as zero feedback. It was hypothesized that, due to lack of cognitive load, participants could easily and quickly learn how to deal with extreme force feedback settings by giving more effort. The study presented in this paper tested this hypothesis by increasing cognitive load by means of an N-back secondary task with the experimental conditions used in the earlier study. The secondary task was performed simultaneously while driving a simulated vehicle with six <b>different</b> force <b>feedback</b> levels provided on the steering wheel. Driving performance was measured using standard metrics such as standard deviation of lateral position, standard deviation of steering wheel angle, steering wheel reversal rate and mean driving speed. It was found that addition of the secondary task affected driving performance for the six <b>different</b> force <b>feedback</b> levels to an equal extent and did not differentially affect performance for the extreme levels of force feedback. Thus, the results do not provide support for the proposed hypothesis. © 2013 ACM...|$|R

50|$|One of {{the oldest}} {{explanations}} for somatization disorder advances the theory {{that it is a}} result of the body's attempt to cope with emotional and psychological stress. The theory states that the body has a finite capacity to cope with psychological, emotional, and social distress, and that beyond a certain point symptoms are experienced as physical, principally affecting the digestive, nervous, and reproductive systems. There are many <b>different</b> <b>feedback</b> systems where the mind affects the body; for instance, headaches are known to be associated with psychological factors, and stress and the hormone cortisol are known to have a negative impact on immune functions. This might explain why somatization disorders are more likely in people with irritable bowel syndrome, and why patients with SSD are more likely to have a mood or anxiety disorder. There is also a much increased incidence of SSD in women with a history of physical, emotional or sexual abuse.|$|E

In the elderly group, regularity was lower when haptic feedback was given in combination with visual feedback as compared to providing haptic feedback alone.

Two force track tasks with different increasing/decreasing force rate have been designed, and 12 participants have been recruited in this experiment.

The statistical analysis revealed that gain of visual stimuli can influence force output significantly.

40|$|In complex environments, such as {{seasonal}} environments, adaptation {{relies on}} several traits {{interacting with the}} environment. Using mathematical modeling of batch experimental evolution, we explored the link between selection, traits and season length. In yeast glucose batch cultures, population dynamics can be separated in three seasons: a fermentation season, during which glucose is consumed and ethanol produced; a respiration season, where ethanol is consumed and a last one where resources are exhausted. Using an ordinary differential equations model calibrated on data of a yeast experimental evolution in successive batch cultures (Spor et al, Evolution, 2014), we showed that the seasonality drives the selection. We found that: (a) a long phase increases selection on the growth rate during this phase, (b) traits that drive response to environmental changes are also under selection (c) <b>different</b> types of <b>feedback</b> between environmental changes and selection pressures occur. Indeed, selection affects {{the composition of the}} population, which in turn leads to changes in resources (glucose and ethanol) and poison (ethanol) dynamics and consequently modifies season length and thus selective pressures on traits.

Car crashes and near-crash events are most commonly caused by driver distraction. Mid-air interaction is a way of reducing driver distraction by reducing visual demand from infotainment.

40|$|The {{mathematical}} {{model of a}} real flexible elastic system with distributed and discrete parameters is considered. It is a partial differential equation with non-classical boundary conditions. Complexity of the boundary conditions {{makes it impossible to}} find exact analytical solutions. To address the problem, we use the asymptotical method of small parameters together with the numerical method of normal fundamental systems of solutions. These methods allow us to investigate vibrations, and a technique for determination of complex eigenvalues of the considered boundary value problem is developed. The conditions, at which vibration processes of different characteristics take place, are defined. The dependence of the vibration frequencies on the physical parameters of the hybrid system is studied. We show that introduction of <b>different</b> <b>feedbacks</b> into the system allows one to control the frequency spectrum, in which excitation of vibrations is possible. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|We use the cosmo-OWLS {{suite of}} cosmological hydrodynamical simulations, which {{includes}} <b>different</b> galactic <b>feedback</b> models, {{to predict the}} cross-correlation signal between weak gravitational lensing and the thermal Sunyaev-Zeldovich (tSZ) y-parameter. The predictions are compared to the recent detection reported by van Waerbeke and collaborators. The simulations reproduce the weak lensing-tSZ cross-correlation, ξ_yκ(θ), well. The uncertainty arising from <b>different</b> possible <b>feedback</b> models appears to be important on small scales only (θ≲ 10 arcmin), while the amplitude of the correlation on all scales is sensitive to cosmological parameters that control {{the growth rate of}} structure (such as σ_ 8, Ω_m and Ω_b). This study confirms our previous claim (in Ma et al.) that a significant proportion of the signal originates from the diffuse gas component in low-mass (M_halo≲ 10 ^ 14 M_) clusters {{as well as from the}} region beyond the virial radius. We estimate that approximately 20 % of the detected signal comes from low-mass clusters, which corresponds to about 30 % of the baryon density of the Universe. The simulations also suggest that more than half of the baryons in the Universe are in the form of diffuse gas outside halos (≳ 5 times the virial radius) which is not hot or dense enough to produce a significant tSZ signal or be observed by X-ray experiments. Finally, we show that future high-resolution tSZ-lensing cross-correlation observations will serve as a powerful tool for discriminating between <b>different</b> galactic <b>feedback</b> models.
