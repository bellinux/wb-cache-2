25|$|Stone Roof, {{a private}} {{residence}} in Nagano, Japan, built in 2010, {{consists of a}} roof which is meant to spring from the ground, providing a complete enclosure to the home. A local stone was chosen to intimately relate itself to the preexisting natural environment of the mountain side. The exterior stone work is made light and airy by cutting each stone <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> and bracing each slice as a pivoting panel. In this way, the heavy quality of stone is diluted and provides the eye with an illusion of lightness, allowing light and air directly into the space within. With this choice of material and construction, {{a new kind of}} transparency emerges; one that not only frames nature the way a glass curtain wall would, but also deeply relates itself to the mountain side.|$|E

60|$|Pemmican, as made in England.--Sir John Richardson describes, in his Narrative, the {{preparation}} of the pemmican that he took with him in his last journey. The following is a résumé of what he says:--The meat used was round of beef; the fat and membranous parts were pared away; it was then cut <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> <b>slices,</b> which were dried in a malt-kiln, over an oak-wood fire, till they were quite dry and friable. Then they were ground in a malt mill; after this process the powder resembled finely-grated meal. It was next mixed with nearly an equal weight of melted beef, suet, or lard; and the plain pemmican was made. Part of the pemmican was mixed with Zante currants, and another part with sugar. Both of these mixtures were much liked, especially the latter. The pemmican, when complete, cost at the rate of 1x. u 1/2 d. per pound, but then the meat was only 6 3/4 d. per pound; it is dearer now. The meat lost more than three-quarters of its weight in drying. He had 17,424 lbs. of pemmican in all; it was made from--fresh beef, 35,641 lbs; lard9 lbs.; currants3 lbs.; and sugar lbs.|$|E

50|$|Tunbridge ware {{is a form}} of decoratively inlaid woodwork, {{typically}} in the form of boxes, that is characteristic of Tonbridge and the spa town of Tunbridge Wells in Kent in the 18th and 19th centuries. The decoration typically consists of a mosaic of many very small pieces of different coloured woods that form a pictorial vignette. Shaped rods and slivers of wood were first carefully glued together, then cut <b>into</b> many <b>thin</b> <b>slices</b> of identical pictorial veneer with a fine saw. Elaborately striped and feathered bandings for framing were pre-formed in a similar fashion.|$|R

The {{processing}} {{of the large}} brown glossy seeds of the African oil bean to obtain ‘Ugba’ involved the following; the oil bean seeds were boiled in an autoclave at a temperature of 121 °C and a pressure of 15 {{pounds per square inch}} (psi) for 1  hr to soften the hard brown testa (shell). The shells were removed and the kernels washed, drained and rewashed with cold water several times.

5000|$|Ultramicrotomy is {{a method}} for cutting {{specimens}} <b>into</b> extremely <b>thin</b> <b>slices,</b> called ultra-thin sections, that can be studied and documented at different magnifications in a transmission electron microscope (TEM). It is used mostly for biological specimens, but sections of plastics and soft metals can also be prepared. Sections must be very thin because the 50 to 125 kV electrons of the standard electron microscope cannot pass through biological material much thicker than 150 nm. For best resolutions, sections should be from 30 to 60 nm. This is roughly the equivalent to splitting a 0.1 mm-thick human hair into 2,000 slices along its diameter, or cutting a single red blood cell into 100 slices.|$|R

40|$|We apply volume {{reconstruction}} for {{visualization of}} a biological specimen {{greater than the}} field of view of a confocal laser scanning microscope. Prior to the volume reconstruction, large specimens are cut <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> physical <b>slices.</b> The first step of volume reconstruction is acquisition of digital volume images (spatial tiles which overlap) from all studied physical slices. The second step is horizontal merging of overlapping spatial tiles of the same physical slice using a registration algorithm based on a mutual information and translation. The third reconstruction step is vertical merging of digital volumes of successive physical slices using an elastic registration algorithm based on B-splines. The resulting large digital volumes are visualized by a VolumePro hardware board that provides volume rendering in real-time. In this paper we show a reconstruction of a chick embryonic kidney...|$|R

40|$|Laser {{scanning}} confocal microscopes {{are capable}} to focus {{a laser beam}} into a layer of an investigated biological specimen, and by the gradual scanning of this layer they acquire an optical section. By consecutive scanning of all preset layers of the specimen we obtain a stack of optical sections, i. e. a 3 D digital representation of the specimen [1]. In the presented study we focus on volume reconstruction of large biological tissues, i. e. tissues greater than field of view and/or thicker than maximal depth of scanning of a confocal microscope. Volume reconstruction consists of the following steps [2]: A) Specimen preparation and cutting <b>into</b> <b>thin</b> physical <b>slices.</b> B) Acquisition of overlapping fields of view (spatial tiles) from all physical slices.

Aim: Develop a metodology for pathway tracing with the substance transmitted by axonal anterograde transport and compare iontophoretic and pressure injection of BDA. Methods: The experiment {{was performed on}} adult rats which where injected iontophoretic and pressure anterograde tracer BDA. One week after injection were decapitated in deep anesthesia, their brains removed, frozen in dry ice and stored at - 70 řC.

50|$|Another Faroese {{specialty}} is tvøst og spik, pilot whale meat and blubber. The meat and the blubber can be preserved and prepared in different ways. Often it is cut <b>into</b> long <b>thin</b> <b>slices,</b> which are called likkja (grindalikkja) in singular and likkjur (grindalikkjur) in plural, {{and hung up}} to dry. These are often used for the so-called kalt borð (cold table) which is {{a table with a}} variety of cold Faroese and foreign dishes. The Faroese dishes can consist of whale meat, whale blubber, dried fish and dried lamb meat, which is called skerpikjøt. The kalda borðið (cold table) is used for festive occasions. Whale meat can also be boiled or, less traditionally, fried as steaks. There are also two ways of salting the whale meat: in dry salt or in salted water (saltlakað grind). Boiled potatoes are normally eaten together with the whale meat and the blubber, but this tradition is not very old, since potatoes were not common in the Faroe Islands before sometime in the early or mid-19th century.|$|R
