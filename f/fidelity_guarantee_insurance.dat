5000|$|The Co-operative Insurance Company Limited {{was formed}} in 1867 to provide fire and <b>fidelity</b> <b>guarantee</b> <b>insurance</b> to {{co-operative}} societies. In 1886, at an Annual General Meeting it was resolved [...] "...that Life Assurance be undertaken by the Company, and that the shareholders forfeit any rights {{they may have to}} the profits of the Life Department and agree that they shall belong exclusively to the Policyholders." [...] In 1899, industrial life business was also introduced and the company was converted into an industrial and provident society, changing its name to Co-operative Insurance Society Limited (CIS). Other classes of business were provided for the general public and not just for co-operative societies and their members.|$|E

40|$|Variable annuities, as a {{class of}} {{retirement}} income products, allow equity market exposure for a policyholder's retirement fund with electable additional guarantees to limit the downside risk of the market. Management fees and <b>guarantee</b> <b>insurance</b> fees are charged respectively for the market exposure and for the protection from the downside risk. We investigate the impact of management fees on the pricing of variable annuity guarantees under optimal withdrawal strategies. Two optimal strategies, from policyholder's and from insurer's perspectives, are respectively formulated and the corresponding pricing problems are solved using dynamic programming. Our results show that when management fees are present, the two strategies can deviate significantly from each other, leading to a substantial difference of the <b>guarantee</b> <b>insurance</b> fees. This provides a possible explanation of lower <b>guarantee</b> <b>insurance</b> fees observed in the market. Numerical experiments are conducted to illustrate our results...|$|R

50|$|Child life {{insurance}} {{is a form}} of permanent {{life insurance}} that insures the life of a minor. It is usually purchased to protect a family against the sudden and unexpected costs of a child’s funeral or burial and to secure inexpensive and <b>guaranteed</b> <b>insurance</b> for the lifetime of the child. It offers guaranteed growth of cash value, which some carriers allow to be withdrawn (collapsing the policy) when the child is in their early twenties. Child life insurance policies typically offer the owner the option to purchase, or in some cases obtain additional <b>guaranteed</b> <b>insurance</b> when the child reachesmaturity.|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we model the claim process of {{financial}} <b>guarantee</b> <b>insurance,</b> and predict the pure premium and the required amount of risk capital. The data used {{are from the}} financial guarantee system of the Finnish statutory pension scheme. The losses in financial <b>guarantee</b> <b>insurance</b> may be devastating during an economic depression (i. e.,Â deep recession). This indicates that the economic business cycle, and in particular depressions, {{must be taken into}} account in modelling the claim amounts in financial <b>guarantee</b> <b>insurance.</b> A Markov regime-switching model is used to predict the frequency and severity of future depression periods. The claim amounts are predicted using a transfer function model where the predicted growth rate of the real GNP is an explanatory variable. The pure premium and initial risk reserve are evaluated on the basis of the predictive distribution of claim amounts. Bayesian methods are applied throughout the modelling process. For example, estimation is based on posterior simulation with the Gibbs sampler, and model adequacy is assessed by posterior predictive checking. Simulation results show that the required amount of risk capital is high, even though depressions are an infrequent phenomenon.
