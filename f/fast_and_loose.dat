25|$|Kracht's 2012 novel Imperium follows on from Ich werde hier sein im Sonnenschein und im Schatten both in {{its very}} {{favourable}} reception by critics {{and in the way}} that it presents a reimagining of history that incorporates actual persons and historical reality while playing <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>loose</b> with dates and details. In this sense the novel bears some similarity to Die Vermessung der Welt (Measuring the World) by Daniel Kehlmann, an author with whom Kracht corresponded while composing the distinctive narrative style of Imperium. The novel follows the travails of the historical figure August Engelhardt in the Bismarck Archipelago (now Papua New Guinea) {{at the beginning of the}} twentieth century. Engelhardt is an idealistic German emigrant who establishes a plantation on an island and founds a colony of cocoivores – radical vegetarians nourished exclusively on coconuts. Engelhardt's history is interspersed with cameo appearances by other figures from German cultural history, such as Hermann Hesse, Thomas Mann and Franz Kafka. The first of Kracht's novels not to be narrated in the first-person, the omniscient narrator informs us of the protagonist's thoughts and contextualises Engelhardt's life within the broader scope of twentieth-century history.|$|E

Erik Himmelsbach of Spin criticized Slap-Happy for {{essentially}} {{being the}} same as all of the band's previous albums, commenting [...] "What was once <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>loose</b> and dump now sounds lazy and stupid". Raoul Hernandez of The Austin Chronicle heavily criticized {{the second half of}} the album for being [...] "one long, nasal, wise-ass line after wise-ass line from Donita Sparks, who [...] is quickly becoming self-parody." [...] Although the album received a mixed reaction from media outlets, Sparks retrospectively regards Slap-Happy as [...] "a good record", and considers it be her third favorite L7 album, behind The Beauty Process and Smell the Magic.|$|E

It was a big release for the studio, starring the popular actor Warner Baxter, in which Lombard received third billing. Following {{the success of the}} film, Paramount Pictures recruited Lombard and signed her to a $350-per-week contract (gradually increasing to $3,500 per week by 1936). They cast her in the Buddy Rogers comedy Safety in Numbers (also 1930), and one critic observed of her work, [...] "Lombard proves [...] an ace comedienne." [...] For her second assignment, <b>Fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>Loose</b> (also 1930) with Miriam Hopkins, Paramount mistakenly credited the actress as [...] "Carole Lombard".

The results are jaw dropping." [...] He also compared it {{to the work of}} The Weeknd and commended its [...] "lack of smut" [...] in the lyrics, stating [...] "it's just Usher playing it <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>loose</b> in falsetto. The result is as subtle as it is unbelievable." [...] Eric Arredondo of Beats Per Minute viewed the song as an improvement over Usher's 2010 album Raymond v. Raymond and addressed the comparisons to The Weeknd, writing that, [...] "though it still doesn't hold much of the innovations and risks of something like The Weeknd's House of Balloons, 'Climax' can do something that most songs on that album can't do without losing most of their fun: be played on the radio." ...|$|E

500|$|Fujishima was {{particularly}} interested in the concept of a goddess [...] "as a job", and turned to Norse mythology as he felt that it was relatively unknown in Japan. Thus Belldandy is based on Verðandi (or Verthandi), the Norse Goddess of the present, (whose name is literally translated as [...] "to become" [...] or [...] "becoming"), and {{she is one of the}} three Norns or [...] "fates" [...] from Norse mythology. Verdandi, when translated into Japanese, becomes ベルダンディー (Berudandī). As the Japanese phonetic system does not distinguish between [...] "b" [...] and [...] "v" [...] or [...] "r" [...] and [...] "l" [...] (although ヴ can describe [...] "v".), [...] "Belldandy" [...] can emerge as a product of consonant substitutions. Indeed, it was in the first chapter of the manga that her name was transliterated as Belldandy rather than Verdandi, and this romanization has stuck since. When the English translations were being prepared, Toren Smith considered returning the name to [...] "Verthandi", (which Smith had determined to be the correct translation of the Old Norse), but chose to stick with Belldandy on the grounds that Fujishima was already [...] "playing <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>loose</b> with the mythos" [...] and thus felt that no further harm was likely to come from employing Fujishima's transliteration. (Nevertheless, in the Swedish translation of the manga, released in 2007, her name was returned to Verdandi).|$|E
500|$|Critics {{and fans}} alike criticized the writers' seeming {{disregard}} for the Lost timeline. Based on the actions and whereabouts of characters in the third season, fans could deduce when parts of Michael's flashbacks occurred in relation to events on the island. John Kubicek of BuddyTV wrote that [...] "This timeline results in some serious issues fans should have with time … This makes almost no sense … Michael left in the boat, {{he had to find}} help, come ashore, somehow explain himself, get on a plane back to New York City, drop off Walt to live with his grandma, find an apartment, get into a car accident, recover, and only then did he meet Tom. Either the writers are playing <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> <b>loose</b> with the concept of time, or Michael had the busiest week {{in the history of the}} world." [...] Using Lostpedia as a reference, Nikki Stafford of Wizard pointed out that the chronology was not only almost inconsistent with the third season, but also with an earlier episode of the same season. Damon Lindelof responded that [...] "we [...] find that the [...] boards can be really toxic" [...] and pointed specifically to the [...] "nitpick" [...] of the possible continuity issues of [...] "Meet Kevin Johnson", saying in defence of the script that [...] "it's television."s Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse] [...] ", The A.V.

However, rela-tively little is known on whether they can be made both more efficient and more accurate, by introducing suitable transformations that exploit general knowledge of the target classes. We demonstrate this functionality through pre-segmentation of input images with a <b>fast</b> <b>and</b> robust but <b>loose</b> segmentation step, to obtain a set of candidate objects. These objects then undergo a spa-tial transformation into a reduced space, retaining but a compact high-level representation of their appearance.

The maintenance of branch density under growth at various temperatures was examined in a selection of mutants in genes known to be important in the control of ROS. In all ROS control mutants tested, growth was shown to branch tighter when grown at higher temperatures (which result in <b>faster</b> growth rates) <b>and</b> <b>looser</b> when grown at lower temperatures (which results in slower growth rates). This can be contrasted with wild-type Neurospora which branches at the same density under both conditions.
