500|$|On 19 January 2001, Majulah Singapura {{was officially}} relaunched in the F-major key, {{as it was}} said to be a [...] "grander and more inspiring arrangement" [...] of the anthem. The Ministry of Information and the Arts (MITA, now the Ministry of Communications and Information (MCI)) took more than a year to produce the new version. Its main {{objective}} was to make the anthem more accessible to all Singaporeans. In May 2000, several leading local composers were invited to rearrange the national anthem in F major. An <b>evaluation</b> <b>panel</b> headed by Bernard Tan selected the version submitted by Cultural Medallion winner Phoon Yew Tien. Phoon's orchestration employed a slower tempo and used more instruments to create a majestic rendition of the anthem. MITA then commissioned Ken Lim to produce a recording by the Singapore Symphony Orchestra conducted by Lim Yau, which was carried out at the Victoria Concert Hall on 20 November 2000. The new arrangement was recorded in seven versions, including two orchestral versions (instrumental, and with soloist Jacintha Abisheganaden and the Singapore Youth Choir) and a piano solo version.|$|E

Synoptic assessments succeed with the ability to formulate expert <b>evaluation</b> <b>panels.</b> Yet many industry experts are busy professionals, and hence, the process of constituting appropriately balanced <b>evaluation</b> <b>panels</b> for project demonstrations is a significant challenge. The discussion includes the outcomes of using the algorithm to automate the panel composition and scheduling process for synoptic assessments of project demonstrations for a batch of 100 students following the Bachelor of Engineering (Honors) degree program in the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at the University of Moratuwa in Sri Lanka. We describe the challenges we faced and our approach towards addressing the issues as well as our encouraging successes...|$|R

50|$|If a Generalist candidate's {{score on}} the FSOT meets or exceeds cutoff, they are invited to submit answers to Personal Narrative Questions, which will be {{reviewed}} by a Qualifications <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Panel.</b> Recently these have been six essays that ask for examples of how the candidate met certain challenges, anchored by the 13 personality characteristics.

To be invited to take the Oral Assessment an applicant must not only pass the FSOT but also the Qualifications <b>Evaluation</b> <b>Panel</b> review. The Department of State's Board of Examiners can find some candidacies unacceptable despite the fact that they passed the FSOT.|$|E

All panelists rated that experience with patients was influential on item ratings. Perception of the severity of symptoms that the items were measuring (94 %), and the description of borderline patients and the performance descriptions (81 %) were influential in their ratings.|$|R
