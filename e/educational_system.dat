40|$|This Master thesis sets {{its goals}} in researching and {{understanding}} the structure of different <b>educational</b> <b>systems.</b> The main goal that this paper inflicts {{is to develop a}} middleware aiming at translating courses between different <b>educational</b> <b>systems.</b> The procedure is to find the meaning of objects and courses from the different <b>educational</b> <b>systems</b> point of view, this is mainly done through processes such as identifying the context, semantics and state of the objects involved, perhaps in different activities. The middleware could be applied, with small changes, to any structured system of education. This thesis introduces a framework for using ontologies in the translation and integration of course aspects in different processes. It suggests using ontologies when adopting and structuring different <b>educational</b> <b>systems</b> on an international level. This thesis will, through an understanding of ontologies construct a middleware for the translation process between different courses in the different <b>educational</b> <b>systems.</b> As an example courses in Sweden, Germany and Tajikistan have been used for the mapping and constructing learning goals and qualifications...|$|R
