A rod float method is most prevailing for discharge measurement in <b>natural</b> <b>rivers.</b> However accuracy of this method is not good because the float could not always follow the mainstream and subjectivity of observer can't completely be removed. Here we report development of AUV (Autonomous-Underwater-Vehicle) designed to measure mean velocity in an open-channel flow.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} results, {{calculated from}} field measurements taken in several frequently flooded <b>natural</b> <b>rivers,</b> which include D and R relationships, variation of flow resistance with depth of flow, the apparent friction factor, and the composite friction factor for flooded <b>natural</b> <b>rivers.</b> The results obtained {{have shown the}} complexity of flow resistance in <b>natural</b> <b>rivers</b> due to {{the interaction between the}} main channel and floodplain flow. The interaction has given rise to a pair of apparent shear stresses at the interface region, which can significantly reduce the discharge capacity of the rivers. The apparent shear was quantified in terms of an apparent friction factor, fa, and {{it was found that the}} apparent shear stress is many times greater than the averaged boundary shear stress of the rivers. Based on the averaged boundary shear stress and apparent shear stress, the composite (actual) friction factor for the rivers can be estimated accurately (R 2 = 0. 99) using a statistical method that had been derived...|$|R
40|$|Experimental {{measurements}} {{were made of}} upwelled spectral signatures of various concentrations of industrial waste products mixed with water in a large water tank. Radiance and reflectance spectra for a biosolid waste product (sludge) mixed with conditioned tap water and <b>natural</b> <b>river</b> water are reported. Results of these experiments indicate that reflectance increases with increasing concentration of the sludge at practically all wavelengths for concentration of total suspended solids up to 117 ppm in conditioned tap water and 171 ppm in <b>natural</b> <b>river</b> water. Significant variations in the spectra were observed and {{may be useful in}} defining spectral characteristics for this waste product. No significant spectral differences were apparent in the reflectance spectra of the two experiments, especially for wavelengths greater than 540 nm. Reflectance values, however, were generally greater in <b>natural</b> <b>river</b> water for wavelengths greater than 540 nm. Reflectance may be considered to increase linearly with concentration of total suspended solids from 5 to 171 ppm at all wavelengths without introducing errors larger than 10 percent...|$|R
40|$|The geochemical {{features}} of {{rare earth elements}} (REEs) in the North and South sewage discharge channels of Tianjin were studied. The results show that concentrations of dissolved REEs in water of the sewage discharge channels are very low, while concentrations of Eu and heavy REEs are higher than those in <b>natural</b> <b>rivers.</b> Concentrations of REEs in unfiltered water are high and they mainly resided on suspended matter. Distribution patterns of the dissolved and suspended light REEs vary reversely with the atomic number. Concentrations of REEs in the sediments and suspended matter are lower than those in <b>natural</b> <b>rivers,</b> and concentrations of REEs in the suspended matter are much lower {{than those in the}} sediments. Distribution patterns of REEs in sediments and suspended matter were similar with light REE enrichment and positive Eu-anomaly. This distribution pattern is different from those of <b>natural</b> <b>rivers.</b> The differences may cause by the large amount of organic pollutants in sewage...|$|R
