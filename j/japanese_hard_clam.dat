40|$|Increased {{numbers of}} benthic predators, {{especially}} crabs, {{have been proposed}} as a factor contributing to the decline of <b>hard</b> <b>clams</b> (Mercenaria mercenaria Linnaeus, 1758) in Great South Bay, NY. The long-term trend in benthic predators in this system was examined using observations on the distribution and abundance of predators that have been collected by the Town of Islip, NY {{as part of an}} annual survey of <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> populations. The survey began in 1978 and extends to the present and provides concurrent observations of habitat (sediment type, and presence/absence of eelgrass), and <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> size-frequency distribution and abundance. Predator type and abundance were reported from 1978 to 1981 and 1991 to 2003, which represents one of the most comprehensive benthic predator data sets currently available for any estuarine system. The annual averages of predator abundance in the survey area primarily show interannual fluctuations in abundance. Xanthid crabs (mud crabs, primarily Dispanopeus sayi Smith, 1869) were the numerically dominant predator in the system; blue crabs (Callinectes sapidus Rathbun, 1895) appeared in the late 1990 s. <b>Hard</b> <b>clam</b> abundance has declined by 44 % since the early 1990 s. An Empirical Orthogonal Function (EOF) Analysis of the predator and <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> data sets showed that fluctuations in predator abundance are: 1) mostly in phase over the survey region and 2) dominated by year-to-year fluctuations in abundance. The EOF results for the <b>hard</b> <b>clams</b> show that <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> abundance fluctuations are: 1) in phase over the survey region and 2) dominated by a decreasing trend in abundance over the time series. The primary EOF modes essentially were uncoupled, which implies no strong predator-prey interactions between the predators and <b>hard</b> <b>clams.</b> By inference, increasing predator abundance {{does not appear to be}} a primary factor producing the long-term decline in <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> populations. Predation pressure per recruit may still have increased because of declining <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> population abundance and the concomitant decline in recruitment.

40|$|Most marine mollusks are osmoconformers, in that, {{their body}} fluid {{osmolality}} {{changes in the}} direction of the change in environmental salinity. Marine mollusks exhibit a number of osmoregulatory mechanisms to cope with either hypo- or hyperosmotic stress. The effects of changes in salinity on the osmoregulatory mechanisms of the <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> (Meretrix lusoria, an economically important species of marine bivalve for Taiwan) have not been determined. In this study, we examined the effect of exposure to hypo (10 ‰) - and hyper (35 ‰) -osmotic salinity on <b>hard</b> <b>clams</b> raised at their natural salinity (20 ‰). The osmolality, [Na+], and [Cl-] of the <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> hemolymph were changed in the same direction as the surrounding salinity. Further, the contents of total free amino acids including taurine in the gills and mantles were significantly upregulated in <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> with increasing salinity. The gill Na+,K+-ATPase (NKA) activity, the important enzyme regulating cellular inorganic ions, was not affected by the changed salinity. Mantle NKA activity, however, was stimulated in the 35 ‰ SW treatment. The taurine transporter (TAUT) is related to the regulation of intracellular contents of taurine, the dominant osmolyte. Herein, a TAUT gene of <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> was cloned and a TAUT antibody was derived for the immunoblotting. The TAUT mRNA expression of the mantle in <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> was significantly stimulated in 35 ‰ SW, but protein expression was not modulated by the changed salinity. In gills of the <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> with 10 ‰ SW, both TAUT mRNA and protein expressions were significantly stimulated, and it may reflect a feedback regulation from the decreased gills taurine content under long-term hypoosmotic acclimation. These findings suggest that TAUT expression is regulated differently in gills and mantles following exposure to alterations in environmental salinity. Taken together, this study used the physiological, biochemical and molecular approaches to simultaneously explore the osmoregulation in tissues of <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> and may further help to understand the osmoregulation in bivalves...|$|R

40|$|An individual-based {{model was}} {{developed}} to simulate growth of the <b>hard</b> <b>clam,</b> Mercenaria mercenaria, in response to temperature, salinity and food supply conditions. Unique characteristics of the model are that: (1) length and tissue weight are related only by condition index, so that weight, up to a point, can vary independently of length, and (2) age is decoupled from length. Tissue weight changes result from the difference in assimilation and respiration. Changes in <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> condition are determined from a standard length-weight relationship for average <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> growth. Changes in <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> length (growth) occur only when condition index is greater than zero, which happens when excess weight for a given length is attained. No change in length occurs if condition index is zero (mean case) or negative (less weight than expected at a given length). This model structure resolves limitations that accompany models used to simulate the growth and development of shellfish populations. The length-frequency distribution for a cohort was developed from the individual-based model through simulation of a suite of genotypes with varying physiological capabilities. <b>Hard</b> <b>clam</b> populations were then formed by the yearly concatenation of cohorts with partially independent trajectories that are produced by cohort- and population-based processes. Development and verification of the <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> model was done using long-term data sets from Great South Bay, New York that have been collected by the Town of Islip, New York. The ability to separately track length and age in the simulations allowed derivation of a general mathematical relationship for describing age-length relationships in <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> populations. The mathematical relationship, {{which is based on}} a twisted bivariate Gaussian distribution, reproduces the features of age-length distributions observed for <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> populations. The parameters obtained from fitting the twisted bivariate Gaussian to simulated <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> length-frequency distributions obtained for varying conditions yield insight into the growth and mortality processes and population-dependent processes, compensatory and otherwise, that structured the population. This in turn provides a basis for development of theoretical models of population age-length compositions. The twisted bivariate Gaussian also offers the possibility of rapidly and inexpensively developing age-length keys, used to convert length-based data to age-based data, by permitting a relatively few known age-length pairs to be expanded into the full age- and length-frequency structure of the population.

Results: Our study used suppression subtractive hybridization (SSH), {{as well as the}} construction of cDNA libraries from hemocytes to identify genes related to the defense of the <b>hard</b> <b>clam</b> against its parasite. <b>Hard</b> <b>clams</b> were experimentally infected with QPX and SSH was performed on mRNA samples extracted from mantle and gill tissues at different times post-challenge.
