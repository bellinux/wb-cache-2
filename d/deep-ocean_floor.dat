Davis (T-AGOR-5), {{was one of}} nine Conrad class oceanographic ships {{built for}} the United States Navy (USN), that later saw service in the Royal New Zealand Navy (RNZN). Serving with the USN from 1963 to 1970, these ships were designed to perform acoustic experiments on sound transmission underwater, and for gravity, magnetism and <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>floor</b> studies.|$|E
50|$|The {{continental}} shelf is {{the portion of}} the continental margin that transitions from the shore out towards to ocean. They are believed to make up 7 percent of the sea floor. The width of continental shelves worldwide varies from a 30 meters to 1500 kilometers. It is generally flat, and ends at the shelf break, where there is a drastic increase in slope angle. The mean slope of continental shelves worldwide is 0° 07’ degrees, and typically steeper closer to the coastline than it is near the shelf break. At the shelf break begins the continental slope, which can be one to five kilometers above the <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> The continental slope often exhibits features called submarine canyons. Submarine canyons often cut into the continental shelves deeply, with near vertical slopes, and continue to cut the morphology to the abyssal plain. The valleys are often V-shaped, and can sometime enlarge onto the {{continental shelf}}. At the base of the continental slope, there is a sudden decrease in slope, and the sea floor begins to level out towards the abyssal plain. This portion of the seafloor is called the continental rise, and marks the end of the continental margin.|$|E
40|$|Seafloor {{imagery is}} an {{important}} tool for scientists engaged in quantifying geological and biological processes operating on the <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>floor.</b> Large-scale mosaics of seafloor imagery have significant advantages over individual still photographs and video footage as {{they are able to}} capture large areas while retaining sufficient resolution to identify small-scale features. However, the process of constructing a mosaic is usually limited to a single panorama or transects from still imagery, and often requires manual control by the user. The goal {{of this paper is to}} describe a methodology that allows for utilization of navigation data for robust automatic construction and geo-referencing of video mosaics. This methodology is designed specifically for the submersible Alvin, but our methodology may be modified for use with other underwater vehicles and is broadly applicable to the creation of mosaics in a variety of seafloor settings...|$|E
50|$|Horizontal and {{vertical}} currents also exist below the pycnocline in the ocean's deeper waters. The movement of water due {{to differences in}} density as a function of water temperature and salinity is called thermohaline circulation. Ripple marks in sediments, scour lines, and the erosion of rocky outcrops on <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>floors</b> are evidence that relatively strong, localized bottom currents exist. Some of these currents may move as rapidly as 60 centimeters (24 inches) per second.|$|R
40|$|Despite its often featureless appearance, the <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>floor</b> {{includes}} {{some of the}} most diverse habitats on Earth. However, the accurate assessment of global deep-sea diversity is impeded by a paucity of data on the geographical ranges of bottom-dwelling species, particularly at the genetic level. Here, we present molecular evidence for exceptionally wide distribution of benthic foraminifera, which constitute the major part of deep-sea meiofauna. Our analyses of nuclear ribosomal RNA genes revealed high genetic similarity between Arctic and Antarctic populations of three common deep-sea foraminiferal species (Epistominella exigua, Cibicides wuellerstorfi and Oridorsalis umbonatus), separated by distances of up to 17 000 km. Our results contrast with the substantial level of cryptic diversity usually revealed by molecular studies, of shallow-water benthic and planktonic marine organisms. The very broad ranges of the deep-sea foraminifera that we examined support the hypothesis of global distribution of small eukaryotes and suggest that deep-sea biodiversity may be more modest at global scales than present estimates suggest...|$|E
40|$|Although {{ferromanganese}} nodules on the <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>floor</b> {{were discovered}} in 1873 during voyages of HMS Challenger, their economic potential came to light only in 1965. By now, the 1970 's "Nodule Rush " has almost come to an end. Most of the pioneer countries in this field have realized that the present techno-economic situation is {{not in favor of}} nodule mining. Therefore, the UN registered Pioneer Investors appear to have preserved the demarcated nodule mine sites for future use. As a spin-off of that Nodule Rush, foreign and Indian scientists explaining the mystery of nodule carpets on the sea-floor have published several research papers. In this paper we attempt to discuss the chemistry, mineralogy, morphology and allied features of the oceanic ferromanganese deposits in relation to their genesis and growth. We also discus in brief the importance of seamount ferromanganese crusts both as resources and as recorders of the paleoceano- graphic events. Oceanic ferromanganese deposits occur mainly in two forms, as nodules and as encrustations; while the nodules form a carpet on the deep-sea abyssal plains...|$|E
40|$|A {{history of}} Mesozoie and Cenozoic palaeoenvironments of the North Atlantie Oeean has been {{developed}} based on {{a detailed analysis of}} the temporal and spatial distribution of major pelagie sediment facies, of hiatuses. of bulk sediment accumulation rates, and of concentrations and fluxes of the main deep-sea sediment components. The depositional history of the North Atlantic can be subdivided into three major phase: (a) Late Jurassie and Early Cretaceous phase: clastic terrigenous and biogenic pelagic sediment components accumulated rapidly under highly productive surface water masses over the entire occan basin; (b) Late Cretaceous to Early Miocene phase: relatively little terrigenous and pelagic biogenic sediment reached the North Atlantic Ocean floor, intensive hiatus formation occurred at variable rates, and wide stretches of the <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>floor</b> were covered by slowly accumulating terrigenous muds: (c) Middle Miocene to Recent phase: accumulation rates of biogenic and terrigenous deep-sea sediment components increased dramatically up to Quaternary times, rates of hiatus formation and the intensity of deep-water circulation inferred from them seem to have decreased. However, accumulation rate patterns of calcareous pelagic sediment components suggest that large scale reworking and di splacement of deep-sea sediments occurred at a variable rate over wide areas of the North Atlantic during this period...|$|E

The Antarctic and Southern Ocean community, represented by 75 scientists and policy-makers from 22 countries, recently met {{to formulate a}} collective vision on the priorities for Antarctic research {{for the next two}} decades and beyond. Here, we assess high-interest research areas related specifically to Southern Ocean life and ecology that, although not all retained as the 80 top priorities among the addressed scientific domains, are of considerable relevance to the biology and ecology of the Southern Ocean. As certain regions of the Southern Ocean ecosystems have witnessed abiotic and biotic changes in the last decades (e. g., warming, climate variability, changes in sea ice, and abundance of marine organisms), such an exercise was urgently needed. We concluded that basic biological information on the taxonomy of numerous organisms is still lacking in areas, such as the <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>floor</b> or the under-ice environments. Furthermore, {{there is a need for}} knowledge about the response and resilience of Antarctic marine ecosystems to change. The continuation of a long-term commitment and the development and use of innovative technology to adequately monitor the Southern Ocean ecosystems is required. Highlighting the most important Southern Ocean research topics allow the identification of the challenges and future requirements in technological development, and both research and funding strategies for the various stakeholders...|$|E
40|$|Before {{the theory}} of plate {{tectonics}} took hold, there was no coherent model for ocean-continent transitions that included both extant continental margins and fragmentary ancient examples preserved in orogenic belts. Indeed, during the early 1900, two strands of thought developed, one relying on the antiquity and permanence of continents and oceans, advocated by the mainstream {{of the scientific community}} and one following mobilist concepts derived from Wegener's hypothesis (1915) of continental drift. As an illustration of the prevailing North-American view, the different composition and thickness of continental and oceanic crust and the resulting isostatic response showed "how improbable it would be to suppose that a continent could founder or go to oceanic depth or that ocean floor at ± 3000 fathoms could ever have been a stable land area since the birth of the oceans" [H. H. Hess, Trans. R. Soc. London, A 222 (1954) 341 - 348]. Because of the perceived permanence of oceans and continents, mountain chains were thought to originate from narrow, elongated, unstable belts, the geosynclines, circling the continents or following "zones of crustal weakness" within them, from which geanticlines and finally mountain belts would develop. This teleological concept, whereby a geosyncline would inevitably evolve into a mountain chain, dominated geological interpretations of orogenic belts for several decades in the mid-twentieth century. However, the concept of permanence of oceans and continents and the concept of the geosyncline had already met with the critiques of Suess and others. As early as 1905, Steinmann considered the association of peridotite, "diabase" (basalt/dolerite) and radiolarite (a typical ocean-continent transition assemblage), present in the Alps and Apennines, as characteristic of the <b>deep-ocean</b> <b>floor</b> and Bailey (1936) placed Steinmann's interpretation into the context of continental drift and orogeny. Indeed, in both authors' writings, the concept of ophiolites as ocean crust is apparent. Between 1920 and 1930, the stage was thus potentially set for modern mobilist concepts that were, however, to prove attractive to only a small circle of Alpine and peri-Gondwanian geologists. After the Second World War, the 1950 s saw the rapid progress of the geophysical and geological exploration of oceans and continental margins that provided the data for a reevaluation of the geosynclinal concept. Actualistic models now equated the former preorogenic miogeosyncline of Stille (1940) and Kay (1951) with passive continental margins [C. L. Drake, M. Ewing, G. H. Sutton, Continental margin and geosynclines: the east coast of North America, north of Cape Hatteras, in: L. Ahrens, et al. (Eds.), Physics and Chemistry of the Earth  3, Pergamon Press, London, 1959, pp.   110 - 189], the (American version of the) eugeosyncline and its igneous rocks with "collapsing continental rises" [R. S. Dietz, J. Geol. 71 (1963) 314 - 333] and the ophiolites, the Steinmann Trinity, of the (European) eugeosyncline with fragments of oceanic lithosphere [H. H. Hess, History of ocean basins, in: Petrologic Studies: a Volume to Honor A. F. Buddington, Geol. Soc. Am., New York. 1962, pp. 599 - 620]. The concept of sea-floor spreading [H. H. Hess, History of ocean basins, in: Petrologic Studies: a Volume to Honor A. F. Buddington, Geol. Soc. Am., New York. 1962, pp. 599 - 620; H. H. Hess, Mid-oceanic ridges and tectonics of the sea-floor, in: W. F. Whittard, R. Bradshaw (Eds), Submarine Geology and Geophysics, Colston Papers 17, Butterworths, London, 1965, pp. 317 - 333] finally eliminated the weaknesses in Wegener's hypothesis and, with the coming of the "annus mirabilis" of 1968, the concept of the geosyncline could be laid to rest. Ocean-continent transitions of modern oceans, as revealed by seismology and deep-sea drilling, could now be compared with the remnants of their ancient counterparts preserved in the Alps and elsewhere. © 2008 Académie des sciences...|$|E
