25|$|Author and investigative {{reporter}} Ethan Brown <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> how police investigations have {{been plagued by}} missteps in the sheriff's office, contributing to lost or missing evidence. Brown's work <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> that there are multiple suspects in the Jeff Davis 8 case and that therefore {{it is unlikely that}} this is a serial killer case; furthermore, Brown <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> that law enforcement's own witnesses have named members of local law enforcement as suspects in the case.|$|R

25|$|On the {{southern}} edge of the vale lies West Heslerton, where recent excavation <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> continuous habitation since the Late Mesolithic Age, about 5000BC. This site <b>has</b> <b>revealed</b> a great deal of dwelling and occupation evidence from the Neolithic period to the present day.|$|R
5|$|Archaeological {{excavations}} {{carried out}} by the Archaeological Survey of India unearthed treasures from the vaults in the buildings, which date the occupation of this monument during Feruz Shah’s reign and also by Sheikh Hasan Tahir (a saint) during Sikander Lodi’s rule {{at the beginning of the}} 16th century. Also, excavations done in 1934 <b>have</b> <b>revealed</b> wooden pillar bases attributed to the Hazar Sutan Palace.|$|E
5|$|Chachaklum's {{principal}} phase of occupation appears to {{date to the}} Terminal Classic period, during the 10th and 11th centuries AD. However, the site possesses massive basal platforms and these, together {{with the presence of}} the E-Group, suggests a longer occupational period than was immediately evident from the first excavations of the site. Further investigations <b>have</b> <b>revealed</b> a long occupational history beginning in the Late Preclassic period and continuing right through to the Late Classic.|$|E
5|$|During Roman Britain, {{iron ore}} was mined in the Weald and transported to Ashford where two {{ironworks}} processed the ore into a workable metal.

A study in 2009 on the native populations of Caprella linearis, a smaller caprellid species in the Helgoland region of the German Bight in the North Sea, <b>have</b> <b>revealed</b> that C. linearis have more or less vanished and have been replaced by C. mutica. C. mutica fouling populations may also incur minor economic effects through the cost of their removal from submerged aquaculture equipment and ship hulls.|$|E
5|$|Inscriptions <b>have</b> <b>revealed</b> several {{important}} administrative designations such {{as prime minister}} (sarvadhikari), treasurer (shribhandari), foreign minister (sandhivirgrahi) and chief minister (mahapradhana). All of these positions came with an additional title of commander (dandanayaka). Other designations were royal steward (manevergade), master of robes (mahapasayita), commander of elephant corps (gajasahani), commander of cavalry (thuragasahani) etc. In the royal house, Niyogis oversaw palace administration, royal clothing and jewellery etc. and the Padiyara were responsible for court ceremonies including door keeping and protocol.|$|E
5|$|Investigations of the West Group <b>have</b> <b>revealed</b> an {{occupation}} {{beginning in the}} Late Classic and reaching its maximum extent in the Terminal Classic. The construction methods used in the West Group were inferior {{to those of the}} acropolis, consisting of finely cut limestone blocks bound with an earth-based mortar rather than the lime-based mortar used in the palace complex. The platforms of the West Group appear to have supported perishable superstructures and some of these buildings may have been dedicated to craft production.|$|E

5|$|Laboratory {{breeding}} {{experiments with}} it and other Omphalotus species <b>have</b> <b>revealed</b> {{a low level of}} compatibility (ability to breed and produce fertile hybrids), suggesting it is genetically distinct and has been isolated for a long time. It is particularly poorly compatible with O.illudens, the authors of the study suggesting the separation may have been as long ago as the Late Carboniferous separation of Gondwana from Laurasia but conceding the lack of any fossil record makes it impossible to know whether the genus even existed at the time.|$|E
5|$|Likewise, the Eskayan speech variety {{has been}} {{associated}} with languages as disparate as Hebrew, Greek, and Etruscan.

5|$|The ancient Egyptians mummified many animal species, from {{cats and}} gazelles to crocodiles, baboons, and birds.

Excavations <b>have</b> <b>revealed</b> evidence of chert workshops dedicated to the production of tools, together with dumps of waste flakes.|$|E
