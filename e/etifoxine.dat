50|$|<b>Etifoxine</b> {{has been}} shown to stimulate the {{biosynthesis}} of endogenous neurosteroids, namely 17-hydroxypregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone, progesterone and tetrahydroprogesterone. Several {{studies have shown that the}} synthesis of neurosteroids is essential to the pharmacological actions of <b>etifoxine.</b> Inhibitors of neurosteroid biosynthesis reverse the anxiolytic and analgesic actions of <b>etifoxine.</b>|$|E
50|$|Unlike benzodiazepines, <b>etifoxine</b> {{appears to}} produce its {{anxiolytic}} effects by activating β2 and β3 subunit containing channels of the GABAA receptor complex (a different binding site than benzodiazepines), and by stimulating {{the production of}} GABA(A) active neurosteroids that act in conjunction with etifoxine's direct effects. This difference in binding means that <b>etifoxine</b> can be used alongside benzodiazepines to potentiate their effects without competing for binding sites; however, {{it also means that}} the effects of <b>etifoxine</b> are not reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} adverse effect is mild {{drowsiness}} at initial dosing. It is {{not associated with}} any withdrawal syndromes or dependence, and is not scheduled in France. In conclusion, <b>etifoxine</b> shows less adverse effects of anterograde amnesia, sedation, impaired psychomotor performance, and withdrawal syndromes than those of benzodiazepines <b>Etifoxine</b> for Pain Patients with Anxiety A recent (2012) review of <b>etifoxine</b> by the French National Pharmacovigilance Committee determined that <b>etifoxine</b> was safe and continued to provide a favorable alternative to benzodiazepine anxiolytics.

5000|$|<b>Etifoxine</b> (INN, {{also known}} as etafenoxine; trade name Stresam) is an {{anxiolytic}} and anticonvulsant drug developed by Hoechst in the 1960s. It is sold in approximately 40 countries for anxiety disorders, without the sedation and ataxia associated with benzodiazepine drugs. It has similar anxiolytic effects to benzodiazepine drugs, but is structurally distinct and does not bind to the benzodiazepine receptor. It is as effective as lorazepam as an anxiolytic, but has fewer side effects. [...] <b>Etifoxine</b> is not a scheduled drug in any country {{in which it is}} sold and does not cause dependence or tolerance. <b>Etifoxine</b> is not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration or the European Medicines Agency.|$|E
50|$|In 1968, after {{completing}} his residency, {{he went to}} Germany {{to learn about the}} clinical drug development (psychopharmacologic and others) of Phase I-II (nomifensine, <b>etifoxine,</b> clobazam, loprazolam, streptokinase, Haemaccel) at the Pharmacologic and Medical Department of Hoechst AG, Behringwerke in Germany.|$|E
50|$|<b>Etifoxine</b> {{seems to}} have been mischaracterized in the 1960-70's as a mild or partial {{benzodiazepine}}, because of its lack of typical benzodiazepine side effects, like sedation and ataxia. Thus, it was deemed to be noncompetitive with benzodiazepine drugs of the time, like Valium, and not introduced into world markets. Not until the 2000's was it discovered that <b>etifoxine</b> worked through completely different mechanisms, i.e.. GABA(A) beta subtype selectivity and neurosteroid biosynthesis (purported to work through TSPO). Realization of the MOA has led to its investigation in a number of preclinical studies as an analgesic, anti-inflammatory and neuroprotectant. Recent publications have chronicled its efficacy as a microglia modulator in models of MS and ICH.|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a systematic analysis}} of experimental and clinical studies of <b>etifoxine.</b> The anxiolytic effect of <b>etifoxine</b> is due, firstly, to the modulation of GABA receptor activity and, secondly, to that of metabolism of neurosteroids that are themselves characterized by anxiolytic and neuroprotective properties. The results of clinical trials of <b>etifoxine</b> are also analyzed. In addition to its anxiolytic effect that partially persists even after treatment discontinuation, <b>etifoxine</b> is ascertained to be characterized by analgesic, neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties. </p...|$|E
40|$|Neurosteroids can {{modulate}} {{the activity}} of the GABAA receptors, and thus affect anxiety-like behaviors. The non-benzodiazepine anxiolytic compound <b>etifoxine</b> has been shown to increase neurosteroid concentrations in brain tissue but the mode of action of <b>etifoxine</b> on neurosteroid formation has not yet been elucidated. In the present study, we have thus in-vestigated the effect and the mechanism of action of <b>etifoxine</b> on neurosteroid biosynthesis using the frog hypothalamus as an experimental model. Exposure of frog hypothalamic explants to graded concentrations of <b>etifoxine</b> produced a dose-dependent increase in the biosynthesis of 17 -hydroxypregnenolone, dehydroepiandrosterone, progesterone and tet-rahydroprogesterone, associated with a decrease in the production of dihydroprogesterone. Time-course experiments revealed that a 15 -min incubation of hypothalamic explants with <b>etifoxine</b> was sufficient to induce a robust increase in neurosteroid synthesis, suggesting that <b>etifoxine</b> activates steroidogenic enzymes at a post-translational level. Etifoxine-evoked neurosteroid biosynthesis was not affected by the central-type benzodiazepine (CBR) receptor antagonist flumazenil, the translocator protein (TSPO) antagonist PK 1119...|$|E
40|$|The low binding {{affinity}} of the approved anxiolytic drug <b>etifoxine</b> (Stresam) at the steroidogenic 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) has {{questioned the}} specific contribution of this protein in mediating the <b>etifoxine</b> neurosteroidogenic efficacy. Residence time (RT) at the binding {{site of the}} classical TSPO ligand PK 11195 is emerging as a relevant neurosteroidogenic efficacy measure rather than the binding affinity. Here <b>etifoxine</b> was evaluated for (i) the in vitro neurosteroidogenic activity in comparison to poorly neurosteroidogenic reference TSPO ligands (PK 11195 and Ro 5 - 4864) and (ii) the affinity and RT at [3 H]PK 11195 and [3 H]Ro 5 - 4864 binding sites in rat kidney membranes. <b>Etifoxine</b> shows (i) high neurosteroidogenic efficacy and (ii) low affinity/short RT at the [3 H]PK 11195 site and low affinity/long RT at the [3 H]Ro 5 - 4864 site, at which <b>etifoxine</b> competitively bound. These {{findings suggest that the}} long RT of <b>etifoxine</b> at the Ro 5 - 4864 binding site could account for its high neurosteroidogenic efficacy...|$|E
40|$|<b>Etifoxine</b> modulates GABAergic {{transmission}} {{and is used}} as an anxiolytic (anti-anxiety) medication. The indications for <b>etifoxine</b> use are anxiety, fear and inner tension.

Reliable estimates of more than 2, 500 biological activities were obtained for this molecule, which were compared with the reference drug lorazepam (benzodiazepine). Results and discussion. The data obtained from chemoreactome simulation may suggest that there are significant differences between the pharmacological effects of <b>etifoxine</b> and benzodiazepine in: 1) the selectivity of binding to various neurotransmitter receptors; 2) anti-inflammatory activity; 3) the effect on hemodynamics and vascular walls; 4) negative side effects and 5) pharmacokinetic parameters.

40|$|International audienceUsing {{positron}} {{emission tomography}} (PET), the present study assessed the binding of [11 C]flumazenil to GABA-A receptors in anesthetized rats following a single intravenous injection of an active dose of either <b>etifoxine</b> (25 mg/kg) or diazepam (1 mg/kg), which are both anxiolytic drugs. [11 C]flumazenil binding was measured in five discrete brain structures, namely the caudate putamen, hippocampus, cerebellum, occipital cortex and parietal cortex. As expected, diazepam injection produced {{a significant decrease in}} [11 C]flumazenil binding, which was interpreted as benzodiazepine GABA-A receptor occupancy, whereas <b>etifoxine</b> increased the binding of [11 C]flumazenil. This first use of in vivo imaging after <b>etifoxine</b> administration revealed the activated binding pattern of [11 C]flumazenil and highlighted the pharmacological differences between <b>etifoxine</b> and benzodiazepines. Using the same [11 C]flumazenil radiotracer, PET neuroimaging could be applied to larger animals and, ultimately, to human subjects, thus providing new perspectives for better defining the molecular pharmacology of <b>etifoxine...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: Cerebral {{ischemia}} is {{a leading}} cause of death and disability with limited treatment options. Although inflammatory and immune responses participate in ischemic brain injury, the molecular regulators of neuroinflammation after ischemia remain to be defined. Translocator protein 18 kDa (TSPO) mainly localized to the mitochondrial outer membrane is predominantly expressed in glia within the central nervous system during inflammatory conditions. This study investigated the effect of a TSPO agonist, <b>etifoxine,</b> on neuroinflammation and brain injury after ischemia/reperfusion. Methods: We used a mouse model of middle cerebral artery occlusion (MCAO) to examine the therapeutic potential and mechanisms of neuroprotection by <b>etifoxine.</b> Results: TSPO was upregulated in Iba 1 (+) or CD 11 b(+) CD 45 (int) cells from mice subjected to MCAO and reperfusion. <b>Etifoxine</b> significantly attenuated neurodeficits and infarct volume after MCAO and reperfusion. The attenuation was pronounced in mice subjected to 30, 60, or 90 min MCAO. <b>Etifoxine</b> reduced production of pro-inflammatory factors in the ischemic brain. In addition, <b>etifoxine</b> treatment led to decreased expression of interleukin- 1 beta, interleukin- 6, tumor necrosis factor-alpha, and inducible nitric oxide synthase by microglia. Notably, the benefit of <b>etifoxine</b> against brain infarction was ablated in mice depleted of microglia using a colony-stimulating factor 1 receptor inhibitor. Conclusions: These findings indicate that the TSPO agonist, <b>etifoxine,</b> reduces neuroinflammation and brain injury after ischemia/reperfusion. The therapeutic potential of targeting TSPO requires further investigations in ischemic stroke...|$|E
40|$|Higher anxiety {{results in}} the {{decreased}} levels of various neurotrophic factors and enkephalins and in impaired production of proinflammatory cytokines. The anxiolytic <b>etifoxine</b> is used to treat anxiety states and adjustment disorders. <b>Etifoxine</b> modulates the GABAergic transmission and metabolism of neurosteroids. The latter determines the unique neurotrophic and neuroprotective properties of the drug, such as increased expression of neurotrophic factors, regeneration of nerve fibers, and preservation and regeneration of myelin sheaths. Other important pharmacological effects of an <b>etifoxine</b> molecule have been also discovered; these are to relieve allodynia related to 3 α-steroids and GABA receptors and to effectively treat cerebral edema, experimental autoimmune encephalitis, and excessive nervous excitability {{in the presence of}} alcohol withdrawal. In addition, the chemoreactome simulation of the molecule of <b>etifoxine</b> has established that its attenuated side effects are due to its lower interaction with serotonin, acetylcholine, adrenergic and other neurotransmitter receptors than is shown by benzodiazepines. <b>Etifoxine</b> has been also found to have anti-inflammatory (due to antihistamine and antileukotriene effects) and antitumor activities and an ability to affect hemodynamics and vessel walls. The paper presents a systematic analysis of the results of trials of the neurotrophic properties of <b>etifoxine.</b> It considers how the drug stimulates the expression of neurotrophic factors, accelerates the maturation and regeneration of nerve fibers, and regenerates myelin sheaths. The neurotrophic effects of <b>etifoxine</b> along with its anxiolytic activity will accelerate the recovery of patients with different neurological diseases and enhance the quality of their neurorehabilitation. </p...|$|E
40|$|<b>Etifoxine</b> (etafenoxine, StresamⓇ) is a non-benzodiazepine {{anxiolytic}} with an anticonvulsant effect. It {{was developed}} in the 1960 s for anxiety disorders and is currently being studied for its ability to promote peripheral nerve healing and to treat chemotherapy-induced pain. In addition to being mediated by GABAAα 2 receptors like benzodiazepines, <b>etifoxine</b> appears to produce anxiolytic effects directly by binding to β 2 or β 3 subunits of the GABAA receptor complex. It also modulates GABAA receptors indirectly via stimulation of neurosteroid production after <b>etifoxine</b> binds to the 18 kDa translocator protein (TSPO) of the outer mitochondrial mem-brane in the central and peripheral nervous systems, previously known as the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor (PBR). Therefore, the effects of <b>etifoxine</b> are not completely reversed by the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil. <b>Etifoxine</b> is used for various emotional and bodily reactions followed by anxiety. It is contraindicated in situations such as shock, severely impaired liver or kidney function, and severe respiratory failure. The average dosage is 150 mg per day for no more than 12 weeks. The most common adverse effect is drowsiness at the initial stage. It does not usually cause any withdrawal syndromes. In conclusion, <b>etifoxine</b> shows less adverse effects of anterograde amnesia, sedation, impaired psychomotor performance, and withdrawal syn-dromes than those of benzodiazepines. It potentiates GABAA receptor-function by a direct allosteric effect and by an indirect mechanism involving the activation of TSPO. It seems promising that non-benzodiazepine anxiolytics including <b>etifoxine</b> will replenish shortcomings of benzodiazepines and selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors according to animated studies related to TSPO.

40|$|Peripheral nerves show {{spontaneous}} regenerative responses, but recovery after {{injury or}} peripheral neuropathies (toxic, diabetic, or chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy syndromes) {{is slow and}} often incomplete, and at present no efficient treatment is available. Using well-defined peripheral nerve lesion paradigms, we assessed the therapeutic usefulness of <b>etifoxine,</b> recently identified as a ligand of the translocator protein (18 kDa) (TSPO), to promote axonal regeneration, modulate inflammatory responses, and improve functional recovery. We found by histologic analysis that <b>etifoxine</b> therapy promoted the regeneration of axons in and downstream of the lesion after freeze injury and increased axonal growth into a silicone guide tube {{by a factor of}} 2 after nerve transection. <b>Etifoxine</b> also stimulated neurite outgrowth in PC 12 cells, and the effect was even stronger than for specific TSPO ligands. <b>Etifoxine</b> treatment caused a marked {{reduction in the number of}} macrophages after cryolesion within the nerve stumps, which was rapid in the proximal and delayed in the distal nerve stumps. Functional tests revealed accelerated and improved recovery of locomotion, motor coordination, and sensory functions in response to <b>etifoxine.</b> This work demonstrates that <b>etifoxine,</b> a clinically approved drug already used for the treatment of anxiety disorders, is remarkably efficient in promoting acceleration of peripheral nerve regeneration and functional recovery. Its possible mechanism of action is discussed, with reference to the neurosteroid concept.

40|$|Background: Essential tremor {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{prevalent}} extrapyramidal disorders, while treatment efficacy in such patients remains low. Clinical polymorphism of essential tremor requires a  differentiated treatment approach, that should be implemented with consideration of objective tremor parameters. Aim: To study efficacy of treatment of essential tremor based on tremorography. Materials and methods: We followed up 85   patients with essential tremor (mean age, 69. 05 ± 1. 2   years) who were treated with anticonvulsants as monotherapy (primidone or topiramate), or with combination treatment with non-selective beta-blockers (propranolol), anxiolytics (hydroxizine, <b>etifoxine)</b> and aminophenylbutyric acid. During the treatment, we assessed changes in functional status by Fahn-Tolosa-Marin Tremor Severity Scale and by tremorography. Results: Under treatment with primidone, there was a decrease in global tremor assessment of postural tremor (p= 0. 036) and of action tremor (p= 0. 001). During treatment with topiramate, there was a decrease in global tremor assessment in all tests performed (p< 0. 0002). Non-specific treatment (anxiolytics) exerted a positive effect on the functional state of patients with essential tremor. Conclusion: Tremor amplitude and duration are the objective parameters that define its severity.
