40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the NiS fire assay, incorporating Te coprecipitation with ICP-MS quantification, procedure for {{the determination of}} the Platinum Group Elements (PGE) and gold (Au) in geological materials, with the aim of improving the method. The general analytical methods for {{the determination of the}} precious metals are reviewed. [...] The sensitivity of an analytical procedure is much influenced by the choice of the determinative step. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) offers a precise, accurate method with low limits of detection for quantification of the PGE and Au. However, inherent in the ICP-MS are problems such as ionic interferences, memory, matrix and drift. The matrix effects of HCI, HNO₄ and Te on the sensitivity of the precious metals using ICP-MS were studied. Within the concentration range examined, the sensitivities of the internal standards (Cd and TI), PGE and Au were found to depend most strongly on the concentration of HCI. The reduction of HCI concentration from 0. 6 M to 0. 2 M provides about 20 % enhancement in the sensitivities of the internal standards, and the PGE. [...] The effects of reducing the quantity of Ni and S used in the NiS fire assay method on the recovery of PGE and Au was investigated in a Pt ore <b>grade</b> <b>sample</b> and a low ppb level sample. In the Pt ore <b>grade</b> <b>sample,</b> the recovery of the precious metals was found not to depend on the mass of Ni used as collector. However, the recovery of Ru, Rh, Pd and Pt in the low ppb level sample was found to be a function of the collector mass used, while the recovery of Os, Ir and Au in the low ppb level sample was not. To explain this behaviour of the PGE, a model equation was derived from the mass balance equation of PGE between the sulphide and silicate liquids, and the bulk partitioning coefficient equation. From this equation, the partition coefficients (D) of the PGE were determined. The D values were also independently determined by analysis of the PGE and Au contents of the sulphide and silicate phases. The D values were functions of PGE concentrations. The D values obtained for a Pt ore <b>grade</b> <b>sample</b> were 4 to 103 times higher than those for the low ppb level sample. D values for Ni, Cu and Cr are also reported. [...] To improve PGE recovery in low ppb samples and to lower reagent blanks, further studies were undertaken. The NiS bead was dissolved in a closed vessel with a smaller amount of HCI, and the quantity of Te (and SnCI₂) used for the coprecipitation of PGE was also reduced significantly to lessen the total dissolved solids in the analytical solution. [...] An improved method has been developed, which offers good precision and acceptable accuracy for the determination of PGE and Au concentration in geological materials. The reagent blank, matrix effect due to HCI, cost of chemicals and sample processing time have been reduced...|$|E

Crushing of particles under compression or shear modifies the grain size distribution, with a tendency for the percentage of fine material to increase.

This paper illustrates an extended experimental investigation of the evolution of the grading of an artificial granular material, consisting of crushed expanded clay pellets under different loading conditions. The changes of grading of the material after isotropic, one-dimensional and constant mean effective stress triaxial compression were described using a single parameter based on the ratio of the areas under the current and an ultimate cumulative particle size distribution, which were both assumed to be consistent with self similar grading with varying fractal dimension.

The {{purpose of this}} study is threefold: First, to examine two models (i. e., young adolescents in grades 7 and 8 and older adolescents in grade 12) of heavy episodic drinking and examine how heavy episodic drinking affects subsequent educational attainment. By utilizing two different developmental transitions, i. e., middle school to high school and high school to college, it may be possible to better understand the temporal effects of alcohol use and subsequent educational attainment. The second {{purpose of this study}} is to examine how alcohol use at Time 1 may lead to the problems in the adolescent 2 ̆ 7 s immediate context due to alcohol (i. e., problems with parents, peers, romantic relationships, problems at school) and to examine if these problems affect educational attainment over and above alcohol use alone. The third {{purpose of this study is}} to examine the potential gender differences in these models. The study uses data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health, which is a large scale, nationally representative school based sample of 20, 745 adolescents who were interviewed in grades 7 to 12. Two longitudinal mediational models were evaluated utilizing structural equation modeling. Binge drinking and number of days drunk were used as indicators for a latent variable of heavy episodic drinking (i. e., LHED). In the 7 th and 8 th grade model, direct effects of LHED were found to predict educational attainment at grade 12. Additionally, in the 7 th and 8 th <b>grade</b> <b>sample,</b> a mediated relationship was found whereby educational attainment was predicted by problems with parents. Problems with parents were predicted by number of days drunk in the past year. In the 12 th <b>grade</b> <b>sample,</b> there were no direct effects or indirect effects of alcohol on educational attainment.

40|$|Graduation date: 1972 The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} one of the effects of the SCIS program in the Corvallis Public Schools. The investigation was based on a comparison of students ability to construct a logical theoretical model from a discrepant event. The total sample consisting of 289 students, was obtained with no known systematic bias through a table of random numbers and district teacher lists. The SCIS sample consisted of 136 students stratified by grade level with one first grade, one first-second split grade, two second grades, and two third grades represented. The non SCIS sample consisted of 153 students stratified along similar grade level lines. The experimental sample had one semester of SCIS prior to the present study. The data gathering session consisted of the researcher presenting the students with a discrepant event in the form of a "theory box. " The theory box was a modified shoe box with s funnel, on top and a hose visible on the bottom to the students. The students observed the researcher pour a clear liquid into the funnel and the liquid came out blue. After some unobstrusive manipulation by the researcher with the theory box, the students observed the clear liquid (from the same original container) being poured into the funnel. The liquid came out of the bottom hose yellow. The students were asked to draw what they thought could be inside of the theory box to explain what they had observed. The data collected was classified as to logical, probably-logical, or non-logical from criteria developed by the researcher in conjunction with members of the Department of Science Education at Oregon State University. Using chi-square analysis, after Siegel, it was concluded that: 1. There was no statistical evidence approaching the. 05 level to support that SCIS was a factor in the ability of primary children to construct a logical theoretical model from a discrepant event when compared on the first and first-second split grade, second grade, and total first through third grade level. 2. It was not possible to analyze the third grade data alone due to lack of high enough expected frequencies in the non-logical, cells for valid use of chi-square. 3. The combined second and third grade SCIS to non SCTS sample was significant beyond the. 10 level, one tailed. This would suggest a weak possibility that SCIS could be a factor in the ability of the combined second and third grade samples to logically explain a discrepant event. 4. Comparison of grade level as a factor obtained significance beyond the. 10 level, two-tailed, for the first and first-second split <b>grade</b> <b>sample</b> to the second grade sample; beyond the. 05 level for the second to third grade sample; and way beyond the. 001 level of significance for the first and first-second split <b>grade</b> <b>sample</b> to the third <b>grade</b> <b>sample.</b> Significant results from chi-square analysis indicated a strong possibility that the grade level of a child was a factor in the ability of young children to construct a logical theoretical model from a discrepant event. Based upon the data gathered in this study, the researcher recommends that a similar study be conducted using a larger sample and covering more grade levels. It also appears logical, to this researcher, to compare the. SCIS to non SCIS students after more than just one semester of experience with SCIS materials. To replicate such a study, further refinement of the researcher. designed Instruments is indicated. Along the line of further research, the researcher recommends that the factors of Sex and I. Q. be explored with the ability of SCIS and non SCIS students to construct a logical theoretical model from a discrepant event. It also seems to this researcher that a significant follow-up study might be a comparison of student ability to construct a logical theoretical model from a discrepant event between students who were classified as pre-operational and concrete operational in terms of the Piaget conservation tasks...|$|E

In this paper, it was introduced the key technology of electronic tongue qualitative discriminant analysis to micro-difference samples. The research objects were four different grades of Xihu Longjing Tea with less difference within small producing area in Hangzhou of Zhejiang Province in China. According to the research, the stability of equipment had not been shown until the fifth repetition for the same sample by the electronic tongue. Finally, the signal from seventh repetitive test was selected to represent the intelligent taste fingerprint for this sample. The fingerprints of electronic tongue collected at different days showed linearity drifting for the same sample. The special tea samples were set into each series of experiments to be considered as the reference sample. All samples’ signals were calibrated with the difference value between the reference sample fingerprint of corresponding test to the designated reference sample. Principal component analysis (PCA) {{results showed that the}} same <b>grade</b> <b>samples</b> were clustered, while the different <b>grades</b> <b>samples</b> were more dispersion and non-overlapping. Through Mahalanobis Distance and Residual Method, the four abnormal tea samples were rejected from highest and 1 st grade respectively. The electronic tongue’s Longjing Tea Grade models were built by soft independent modeling of class analogy (SIMCA). The discrimination accuracy for tea <b>sample</b> <b>grade</b> were both 100 % for correction set and prediction set. Through this study, it was established the technical specification and flow for the quick detection of tea by electronic tongue, which including the determination on intelligent taste spectrum repeatability performance, system error calibration for spectrum drifting, rejection for abnormal tea sample based on taste spectrum and establishment for the quality judgment model. The technical specification provides the theoretical base for reasonable use of electronic tongue...|$|R
25|$|Phosphine (IUPAC name: phosphane) is the {{compound}} with the chemical formula PH3. It is a colorless, flammable, toxic gas and pnictogen hydride. Pure phosphine is odorless, but technical <b>grade</b> <b>samples</b> have a highly unpleasant odor like garlic or rotting fish, {{due to the}} presence of substituted phosphine and diphosphane (P2H4). With traces of P2H4 present, PH3 is spontaneously flammable in air, burning with a luminous flame. Phosphines are also a group of organophosphorus compounds with the formula R3P (R = organic derivative). Organophosphines are important in catalysts where they complex to various metal ions; complexes derived from a chiral phosphine can catalyze reactions to give chiral, enantioenriched products.|$|R
