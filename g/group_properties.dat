40|$|In {{the last}} decade several estimators have been {{proposed}} that enforce the <b>grouping</b> <b>property.</b> A regularized estimate exhibits the <b>grouping</b> <b>property</b> if it selects groups of highly correlated predictor rather than selecting one representative. The pairwise fused lasso is related to fusion methods but does not assume that predictors have to be ordered. By penalizing parameters and differences between pairs of coefficients it selects predictors and enforces the <b>grouping</b> <b>property.</b> Two methods how to obtain estimates are given. The first is based on LARS and works for the linear model, the second is based on quadratic approximations and works in the more general case of generalized linear models. The method is evaluated in simulation studies and applied to real data sets. ...|$|R

40|$|For {{many groups}} the {{structure}} of finitely generated subgroups is generically simple. That is with asymptotic density equal to one a randomly chosen finitely generated subgroup has a particular well-known and easily analyzed structure. For example a result of D. B. A. Epstein says that a finitely generated subgroup of GL(n;R) is generically a free group. We say that a group G has the generic free <b>group</b> <b>property</b> if any finitely generated subgroup is generically a free group. Further G has the strong generic free <b>group</b> <b>property</b> if given randomly chosen elements g_ 1, [...] .,g_n in G then generically they are a free basis for the free subgroup they generate. In this paper we show that for any arbitrary free product of finitely generated infinite groups satisfies the strong generic free <b>group</b> <b>property.</b> There are also extensions to more general amalgams - free products with amalgamation and HNN groups. These results have implications in cryptography. In particular several cryptosystems use random choices of subgroups as hard cryptographic problems. In groups with the generic free <b>group</b> <b>property</b> any such cryptosystem may be attackable by a length based attack...|$|R
