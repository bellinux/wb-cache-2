40|$|Using {{permanent}} magnets on a rotor can both simplify {{the design and}} increase the efficiency of electric machines compared to using electromagnets. A drawback, however, {{is the lack of}} existing automated assembly methods for large machines. This paper presents and motivates a method for robotized surface mounting of {{permanent magnets}} on <b>electric</b> <b>machine</b> <b>rotors.</b> The translator of the Uppsala University Wave Energy Converter generator is used {{as an example of a}} rotor. The robot cell layout, equipment design and assembly process are presented and validated through computer simulations and experiments with prototype equipment. A comparison with manual assembly indicates substantial cost savings and an improved work environment. By using the flexibility of industrial robots and a scalable equipment design, it is possible for this assembly method to be adjusted for other rotor geometries and sizes. Finally, there is a discussion on the work that remains to be done on improving and integrating the robot cell into a production line...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Nowadays, {{switched}} reluctance motors (SRMs) {{attract more}} and more attention. Switched reluctance machines have emerged as an important technology in industrial automation. They represent a real alternative to conventional variable speed drives in many applications. It not only features a salient pole stator with concentrated coils, which allows earlier winding and shorter end turns than other types of motors, but also features a salient pole rotor, which has no conductors or magnets and is thus the simplest of all <b>electric</b> <b>machine</b> <b>rotors.</b> Simplicity makes the SRM inexpensive and reliable, and together with its high speed capacity and high torque to inertia ratio, makes it a superior choice in different applications. This research attempts to create a MATLAB model of multiphase SRM using the equations governing the dynamic behavior of linear inductance profile SRM. This simulation model can then be used see the impact of any control system on SRM behavior. Simulation results also prove the exactness of the model.

The proposed wound reluctance <b>rotor</b> <b>machine</b> can produce an n-phase <b>rotor</b> <b>electric</b> {{power from the}} rotor windings to a resistive or inductive load, independent of rotor torque, at any desired synchronous speed. The two-stator windings, with a different number of poles, are fed from two voltage source inverters on a common dc link. This type of machine {{can be used in}} applications that require control of both rotor torque and <b>rotor</b> <b>electric</b> power, such as contactless rotational antennas and turret systems. The machine mathematical model is presented, with open- and closed-loop control systems, simulated and experimentally validated...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — This work {{concerns}} the design, building {{and testing of}} a prototype four-quadrant energy transducer (4 QT) for hybrid electric vehicles [1], [6]. The paper describes the test and verification of the 4 QT prototype concerning machine parameters, efficiency and thermal performance. The 4 QT consists of two different electric radial flux machines: one double <b>rotor</b> <b>machine</b> (DRM) and one conventional machine. In this paper, the conventional machine will simply be referred to as the stator machine (SM). The prototype is designed for a power of 30 kW in each of the double <b>rotor</b> <b>machine</b> and the stator machine [2]. The double <b>rotor</b> <b>machine</b> has an inner rotor with a 3 -phase winding fed through sliprings and an outer rotor with inner permanent magnets. The outer rotor has also a set of magnets on its outside and serves therefore as rotor for the stator machine. The input shaft is connected to the inner rotor and the output shaft to the outer <b>rotor.</b> Both <b>machines</b> are designed to work as motors and generators. The 4 QT is mounted between the internal combustion engine (ICE) and the final reduction gear in a hybrid vehicle; the ICE is connected to the input shaft and the final gear to the output shaft. The function of the 4 QT is to keep the operation of the ICE at optimum efficiency at all speeds and torques required by the vehicle. To do so, the speed is controlled with the DRM and the torque with the SM...|$|R
