Video camera equipment includes four Sony BVP-700 CCD cameras, and two Sony BVP-750 CCD handheld cameras, both using Vinten pedestals. A GVG 4000-3 <b>digital</b> <b>component</b> production switcher, and GVG 7000 <b>digital</b> <b>component</b> routing switcher {{are used to}} route visual feeds to the control room, with multiple digital and analogue video recorders used to store footage. Graphics are provided by a Chyron Lyric Pro character generator and an Avid Deko character generator. Audio facilities consist of a Calrec T Series digitally controlled analogue mixing console, and a Yamaha digital mixing console used for tape playback support and utility audio work. While exact budgets for other seasons are not known, the 39th season (2013â€“2014) had a budget of just over $70million, for which it received a subsidy from New York State {{in the amount of}} $12.3million.|$|E
25|$|Uncompressed <b>digital</b> <b>component</b> {{signals are}} transmitted. Data is encoded in NRZI format, and a linear {{feedback}} shift register {{is used to}} scramble the data to reduce the likelihood that long strings of zeroes or ones will be present on the interface. The interface is self-synchronizing and self-clocking. Framing is done by detection of a special synchronization pattern, which appears on the (unscrambled) serial digital signal to be a sequence of ten ones followed by twenty zeroes (twenty ones followed by forty zeroes in HD); this bit pattern is not legal anywhere else within the data payload.|$|E
25|$|Power supply {{imperfections}} (e.g., {{power signal}} ripple, non-zero source impedance) {{may lead to}} noticeable deviations from ideal operational amplifier behavior. For example, operational amplifiers have a specified {{power supply rejection ratio}} that indicates how well the output can reject signals that appear on the power supply inputs. Power supply inputs are often noisy in large designs because the power supply is used by nearly every component in the design, and inductance effects prevent current from being instantaneously delivered to every component at once. As a consequence, when a component requires large injections of current (e.g., a <b>digital</b> <b>component</b> that is frequently switching from one state to another), nearby components can experience sagging at their connection to the power supply. This problem can be mitigated with appropriate use of bypass capacitors connected across each power supply pin and ground. When bursts of current are required by a component, the component can bypass the power supply by receiving the current directly from the nearby capacitor (which is then slowly recharged by the power supply).|$|E
