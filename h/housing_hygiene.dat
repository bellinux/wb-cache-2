40|$|Background: An {{evaluation}} of a smoke-free home initiative launched in Rotherham, northern England, in July 2009. Methods: Two approaches were used: (i) a postal survey of participants 4 months after signing up as a SFH and (ii) a telephone consultation. The survey was sent to 620 households (of 654 who signed up to the scheme); 289 (46. 6 %) were returned. The telephone consultation involved 20 households before and 20 after signing up to the scheme. Results: Of the households that permitted some smoking at home before the initiative, ∼ 78 % became smoke free after signing up (uncertainty due to missing replies). A high number of participants (169, 60. 8 %) were already informally smoke free. The most common reasons for participation concerned health, environment, and fire safety. Participants were motivated by, amongst other things, information given in a booklet and by the offer of a fire-safety referral. The most immediate benefits noted by participants were improvements in <b>house</b> <b>hygiene.</b> The most important hindrance to success {{seemed to be a}} lack of power to enforce the ban at home, particularly {{on the part of those}} living in smokers’ homes. Conclusion: The Rotherham initiative succeeded in creating smoke-free homes. The results should help those planning similar initiatives. Important points include that: many participants had already instituted some rules regarding smoking at home; whether and how to include households that are already smoke-free; risk of fire and concern with <b>house</b> <b>hygiene</b> are important motivations; those living in smokers’ homes may lack power to initiate smoke-free rules...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Limiting the {{post-weaning}} {{intake of}} the young rabbit is now known to improve its resistance to digestive troubles (Gidenne et al. 2012), while the feed conversion is improved. In contrast a poor hygiene of housing {{is supposed to have}} a negative impact on performances and health, as demonstrated in the piglet (Le Floc'h et al., 2010). However, these two factors may interact in determining performances and health as recently showed in pig (Pastorelli et al., 2012). We thus aimed to determine the effect of a moderate post-weaning feed restriction in the rabbit to cope with a poor <b>housing</b> <b>hygiene,</b> in terms of growth and health. Methods: Restriction and <b>housing</b> <b>hygiene</b> were studied according to a 2 X 2 factorial design: free intake "F" or restricted "R" at 70 % of F, and high vs low hygiene of housing (H and L), and thus corresponded to four groups of 105 rabbits: HF, HR, LF, LR. Rabbits (INRA hybrid line) were fed the same pelleted experimental diet (crude protein 17. 4 %, ADF= 18. 4 % as fed) and housed in collective cages (5 rab. /cage), in two independent breeding rooms (high or low hygiene), from weaning (28 d) to slaughter (63 d). The intake of the R groups was adjusted three times per week to reach 70 % of the intake of F groups within each room. The poor hygiene of housing was obtained by avoiding cleaning one breeding room before and during the experiment. Mortality was checked daily, while morbidity (rabbits having clinical signs of diarrhoea or a very low growth) was checked weekly as for the intake and live weight control Results: No significant interactions were found between the restriction and hygiene, for performances or health status. From 28 to 63 d old the mortality rate was relatively low (meanly 11 %) suggesting a good health status. Although the number of rabbits was insufficient to reach substantial conclusions about the health impact, we observed that mortality from digestive troubles started one week after weaning (figure 1) and levelled after 7 weeks of age. We detected a significant positive impact of the feed restriction on the mortality rate during the post-weaning period (28 - 40 d old) : 1. 9 vs 6. 2 % (P= 0. 046). For the whole growth period, restriction or low hygiene did not affect significantly the mortality rate, although we recorded the highest mortality for the rabbits fed freely in poor hygiene housing (15 / 105). In parallel, the morbidity rate was not affected by the restriction strategy, but was surprisingly lower in low hygiene of housing (table 1) during the post weaning period. With a 30 % reduced intake the weight gain was meanly reduced by 16 % (49. 9 vs 41. 7 g/d from 28 to 63 d old, P< 0. 001, table 2). Accordingly, the feed conversion was sharply improved for restricted rabbit groups by 16 % (2. 47 vs 2. 11 from 28 to 63 d old, P< 0. 001), as found previously (Gidenne et al., 2012). The level of <b>housing</b> <b>hygiene</b> did not greatly affect the growth, although the post weaning daily gain tended to be lower during the two weeks after weaning (42. 6 vs 41. 3 g/d, P= 0. 09). The feed conversion was surprisingly better for rabbit housed in poor hygiene conditions (2. 30 vs 2. 25 from 28 to 63 d old, P= 0. 03), sourcing from a slightly lower intake (107. 0 vs 103. 2 g/d, P= 0. 02). In conclusion, our strategy of feed restriction improved sharply the feed conversion, from 2 weeks after weaning, and was beneficial for the health of the rabbit during the post-weaning period. Our model of hygiene degradation seemed insufficiently stressful to affect the health of the rabbit, and should be further investigated...|$|E

40|$|Diseases {{are often}} thought {{to result from}} a single cause. Although this is {{sometimes}} the case, e. g. with a highly virulent infection such as Classical Swine Fever (CSF), more often clinical disease in swine herds results from multiple predisposing factors. This {{is especially true in}} modern intensive pig husbandry, in which the role of highly infectious diseases is limited to (nonetheless devastating) outbreaks. More important nowadays are diseases, although associated nith an agent, without a clear pathogenesis. The emphasis in disease control thusfar has been on treatment, eradication and prevention. This has been achieved by focusing attention on husbandry factors, such as climate, <b>housing,</b> <b>hygiene,</b> management, and nutrition. Although this approach has been successful for a number of diseases, several health problems are persistent. There are strong indications that in the latter, intrinsic animal factors are important. Successful handling of these problems requires knowledge of the (patho) physiology of the pig. In this article, several characteristics of pig physiology associated with the occurrence of disease are described. It appears that the modern (fattening) pig is exceptional among other animal species in that its cardiovascular system is mismatched to its body weight. It is argued that this particular disposition causes relatively minor disturbances to have major consequences in the pig.

40|$|Udder {{health was}} studied in 300 dairy herds grouped in three {{categories}} {{according to the}} bulk milk somatic cell count. In all herds, lactating cows were housed in a free-stall barn during the winter. All herds participated in a three or four-weekly milk recording system, had annual production quota between 300, 000 and 900, 000 kg, and were stocked with cows of the Holstein-Friesian or Dutch Friesian breeds. The incidence of clinical mastitis was not different among herds with a low (< or = 150, 000), middle (151, 000 to 250, 000), or high (251, 000 to 400, 000 cells/ml) bulk milk somatic cell count. Clinical mastitis caused by Gram-negative pathogens occurred more often in herds with a low bulk milk somatic cell count. Clinical mastitis caused by Staphylococcus aureus, Streptococcus dysgalactiae, or Streptococcus agalactiae occurred more often in herds with a high bulk milk somatic cell count; however, the incidence of clinical Streptococcus uberis mastitis was not different among the three herd categories. The differences in bulk milk somatic cell count between the categories {{could be explained by}} the management practices studied. The incidence of clinical E. coli mastitis was mostly related to <b>housing,</b> <b>hygiene,</b> and milking machine. The incidence of clinical Staphylococcus aureus mastitis was associated with factors that were related to the bulk milk somatic cell count and to factors of which it was not clear whether they were a cause or effect of the high incidence of Staphylococcus aureus mastitis. The incidence of clinical Streptococcus dysgalactiae mastitis was related to nutrition, milking technique, and milking machine. The incidence of clinical Streptococcus uberis mastitis was associated with housing, nutrition, and milking machine. Two groups of farmers and herds could be differentiated.

According to the Convention on the Rights of the Child appropriate measures should be taken by State Parties to ensure the survival and development of the child to a maximum extent and to diminish infant and child mortality. As countries have tried to reduce the global under-five child mortality rate with two-thirds between 1990 and 2015, which is defined as the Millennium Development Goal 4 by the World Health Organization, only 62 of the 195 countries have achieved this degree of reduction. As a consequence world leaders have renewed their goals in which every nation is expected to make every effort to further reduce preventable child deaths. In the Netherlands child mortality has declined in the past centuries due to improvements in social circumstances, sanitation, <b>housing,</b> <b>hygiene</b> and health care, and lower birth rates. Although 1130 Dutch children aged 0 up to and including 19 years (mortality rate 29. 4 per 100. 000 children) died in 2014, there are still child deaths that are avoidable. Understanding the nature and patterns of child mortality and the factors that have contributed to death is essential to direct preventive strategies. The aim of this thesis is to investigate how to prevent future child deaths and optimize family support in the Netherlands.

Officially established work hours were in most periods longer and days off were fewer than for civilian workers. Often official work time regulations were extended by local camp administrators.|$|R
