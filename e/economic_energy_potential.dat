40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an assessment of}} global <b>economic</b> <b>energy</b> <b>potentials</b> for all major natural energy resources. This work is based on both an extensive literature review and calculations using natural resource assessment data. Economic potentials are presented {{in the form of}} cost-supply curves, in terms of energy flows for renewable energy sources, or fixed amounts for fossil and nuclear resources, with strong emphasis on uncertainty, using a consistent methodology that allow direct comparisons to be made. In order to interpolate through available resource assessment data and associated uncertainty, a theoretical framework and a computational methodology are given based on statistical properties of different types of resources, justified empirically by the data, and used throughout. This work aims to provide a global database for natural energy resources ready to integrate into models of energy systems, enabling to introduce at the same time uncertainty over natural resource assessments. The supplementary material provides theoretical details and tables of data and parameters that enable this extensive database to be adapted to a variety of energy systems modelling frameworks.

40|$|Increased {{generation}} of methane (CH 4) from municipal solid wastes (MSW) alarms {{the world to}} take proper initiative for the sustainable management of MSW, because it is 34 times stronger than carbon dioxide (CO 2). Mounting land scarcity issue around the world brands the waste to energy (WtE) strategy for MSW management in urban areas as a promising option, because WtE not only reduces the land pressure problem, but also generates electricity, heat, and green jobs. The goal {{of this study is}} to evaluate the renewable electricity generation potential and associated carbon reduction of MSW management in Bangladesh using WtE strategies. The study is conducted in two major cities of Bangladesh: Dhaka and Chittagong. Six different WtE scenarios are evaluated consisting of mixed MSW incineration and landfill gas (LFG) recovery system. <b>Energy</b> <b>potential</b> of different WtE strategy is assessed using standard energy conversion model and subsequent GHGs emissions models. Scenario A 1 results in highest <b>economic</b> and <b>energy</b> <b>potential</b> and net negative GHGs emission.

40|$|This chapter {{illustrates}} that the motor systems {{account for more}} than 60 % of the electricity consumed in industry worldwide. Appropriate use of existing technologies in motor-driven systems could save about 200 billion kWh of electricity per year in Europe alone. Electricity consumption in compressed air systems is about 80 TWh in the EU- 15; worldwide consumption amounts to about 400 TWh. Highest electricity consumption for compressed air occurs in the chemical industry and the steel industry, the highest share of consumption for compressed air to total consumption of 18 % occurs in the textile and leather industry. The <b>economic</b> <b>energy</b> saving <b>potential</b> in compressed air systems is about one third, equivalent to about 2. 3 % of the industrial electricity consumption worldwide. Barriers hindering the realization of this potential are mainly managerial or financial.

This paper showcases the potential of databases and, by using the example of Germany, it presents a methodology for appraising the <b>economic</b> and <b>energy</b> reduction outcomes of building renovation policies. A dynamic bottom-up simulation model, the Invert/EE-Lab, evaluates the effects of three scenarios of economic and regulatory incentives for three different renovation packages oriented towards the standards defined by the German building code (EnEV) {{as well as the}} support programmes of the Federal Development Bank (KfW).

40|$|Despite {{the large}} <b>economic</b> <b>energy</b> saving <b>potential,</b> in the EU the energy service {{companies}} (ESCOs) market for residential buildings {{is much less}} developed than in other demand sectors (e. g. the industry or public/service sectors). Given the existing situation, energy policy experts and researchers appear generally quite sceptic {{about the possibility of}} a real and significant development in the near future. Besides sector cross-cutting barriers (e. g. low level of energy prices, lack of information and awareness, lack of appropriate forms of finance) there are indeed specific barriers which make a large scale application of the ESCO model for residential buildings particularly difficult. However encouraging development trends are being registered in specific market segments where the possibility of aggregating the demand or exploiting good relationships with customers have created interesting investment opportunities for ESCOs. This paper aims to analyse the present situation for the development of the ESCO market in the residential sector in Europe. Specific market barriers and some existing energy policies affecting this market are also described together with a series of interesting case studies highlighting promising development trends.

An EU study was ables to show that <b>economic</b> <b>energy</b> saving <b>potentials</b> of more than 30 % exist which, in Germany alone, correspond to the output of 2 coal-fired power stations or a total amount of electricity of approx. 5 TWh. It is {{the objective of the}} campaign Druckluft effizient to activate these saving potentials. A large share of these potentials should be achieved by the end of 2004 using a wide variety of activities. Among others, the campaign offers compressed air benchmarking and a free compressed air audit campaign. The aim is to show companies the saving potentials not just qualitatively but also quantitatively. Publishing the results should encourage the implementation of measures in other companies of various sectors. This paper describes the procedure and the results of the measurement campaign, which is accompanied by an evaluation process. The saving potentials determinde lie between 10 and 65 % and it was ascertained that, in many cases, savings could already be identified during an on-site inspection even without measurement devices. The Benchmarking, started at the end of 2003 helps to clarify short comings in compressed air systems.

40|$|The {{current state}} of {{achieving}} the 20 % energy saving target by 2020 {{as well as the}} realization of the EU 2030 target adopted in October rank very high on the EU energy policy agenda. Scenario-based analysis using bottom-up simulation models provides information on the impact of implemented policies as well as future saving potentials. Our analysis has two main objectives: (i) to assess the contribution of implemented policies towards achieving the 2020 energy efficiency target of 20 %; (ii) to assess <b>energy</b> efficiency <b>potentials</b> beyond implemented policies until 2020 and 2030. For both objectives, we apply a bottom-up modelling approach using detailed sector models covering residential and non-residential buildings, industry, residential and tertiary appliances as well as transport. In order to assess the different policy options and saving potentials, we define several scenarios including a baseline (with and without early action and with planned measures), a scenario with additional measures not yet implemented and three scenarios representing saving potentials (from very cost-effective to “near economic”). Our results show that the scenario including early action misses the 20 % energy saving target by 2020 by about 2. 3 %. Including additional measures (and intensifying existing measures) it is possible to reach the 20 % target. Regarding the new 2030 targets of the EU, our modelling approach shows that primary energy consumption can be reduced by 41 % compared to the PRIMES 2007 baseline by fully exploiting the <b>economic</b> <b>energy</b> savings <b>potentials.</b> This is considerably more than the reduction by 27 % as decided by the European Council. The resulting decrease of GHG emissions amounts to more than 45 % in this scenario (assuming a share of renewable of 27 %).

Only such detailed models allow simulating the different types of energy-efficiency policies (e. g. standards, taxes, ETS, audits, information programs, subsidies) ...|$|R
