5000|$|Velveeta is {{the brand}} name of a {{processed}} cheese product having a taste that is identified {{as a type of}} American cheese, but with a softer and smoother texture than cheese. As a result, when melted/heated, Velveeta maintains a fully integrated, and evenly clump-free liquid texture. It was invented in 1918 by Emil Frey of the Monroe Cheese Company in Monroe, New York. In 1923, The Velveeta Cheese Company was incorporated as a separate company, and was sold to Kraft Foods in 1927. The product was advertised at the time as a nutritious health food. According to Kraft's website, in the 1930s, Velveeta became the first cheese product to gain the American Medical Association's seal of approval. It was reformulated in 1953 as a cheese spread. Velveeta is labeled in the United States as a [...] "Pasteurized Recipe Cheese Product" [...] (see processed cheese). The name [...] "Velveeta" [...] is intended to connote a velvety smooth <b>edible</b> <b>product.</b> Smoothness and melting ability are promoted as its properties that result by reincorporating the whey with the curd. The brand has also been successfully spun off into a varied, Velveeta-based product line.|$|E

Despite the very high capacity of oilseed rape to take up nitrate, many authors have reported a very low recovery of nitrogen in field-grown crops whatever the level of N fertilizer applied. In this manuscript we describe the main biochemical and molecular mechanisms involved in nitrate uptake, reduction, assimilation and N recycling during the reproductive period to gain sufficient knowledge to determine the relative importance of environmental and genetic factors determining N management in plants. This understanding will provide the necessary background for improvement of oilseed rape varieties...|$|E
40|$|The {{nutrient}} {{requirements of}} the fast growing filamentous fungi Neurospora crassa to convert animal waste into an <b>edible</b> <b>product</b> containing high amounts of protein were assessed by selectively excluding nutrients from supplemental solutions of Vogel salts and trace elements added to the waste.

Overall, {{these results suggest that}} the nutritional requirements for sustainably growing Neurospora crassa on animal waste may not be as stringent as anticipated. Therefore, commercial implementation of the Neurospora crassa project may be more achievable...|$|E
40|$|Castration {{has long}} been a {{traditional}} practice in the United States. Research studies indicate that intact males grow more rapidly, utilize feed more efficiently and produce a higher-yielding carcass with less fat and more <b>edible</b> <b>product.</b> The disadvantages of the intact male include aggressive behavior (bull and boar); undesirable odors and flavors (boar and ram); lower quality grade (bull); lower meat tenderness (bull and ram) and undesirable meat color (bull and ram). Research is needed to develop antemortem and(or) postmortem handling procedures that offset the disadvantages of the intact male so that the meat and livestock industry can take advantage of their rapid growth and favorable lean production traits.

40|$|Radicchio &ldquo;Rosso di Treviso tardivo&rdquo; (Cichorium intybus L., group rubifolium), {{a typical}} {{vegetable}} of north-eastern Italy, has gained increasing commercial interest {{in recent years}} due to its particular shape and culinary features.

Results showed that nitrate and nitrite contents in edible portions never exceed the most restrictive EU limits. A continuous reduction in NO 3 content was observed during the forcing process, while NO 2 showed a peak at 10 FD. Organic N significantly increased during the forcing process due to NO 2 reduction.

40|$|Among orchids, vanilla is {{the only}} species that is an <b>edible</b> <b>product.</b> Its farming is being {{promoted}} in Colombia {{as an alternative to}} traditional crops, especially among small and medium farmers. Existing crops have a limited genetic base and are therefore susceptible to biotic stress, particularly those caused by viruses and fungi. Wild vanilla can be a source of variability that could help increase its gene pool and could also provide naturally associated endophyte microorganisms with antagonistic properties to fight pathogens of farmed vanilla. In this study we assessed the understanding of vanilla cultivation as well as the diversity of the genus Vanilla in Colombia. As a result of this first phase of research, we found twenty species of Colombian vanilla and 60 morphospecies of endophytic microorganisms. We discuss the relevance of these findings and their potential impact on promoting vanilla farming, and also discussed the use of these plants as a model group for basic research...|$|E
