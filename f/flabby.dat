5|$|Joe and Bonnie host a {{backyard}} barbecue, where Joe's baby daughter, Susie, {{gets into a}} fight with Stewie over a doll and attacks him. Upset by this, Peter takes Stewie to train at the local gymnasium. A trainer notices Stewie struggling with barbells and offers steroids. Peter injects the drugs into Stewie, who becomes incredibly buff and develops an aggressive personality, much to the horror of his family. Stewie becomes tormenting towards Brian. As time passes, Stewie's drugs gradually wear off, much to his shock. His skin becomes incredibly loose and <b>flabby.</b> Stewie jumps out of his bedroom window to avoid Brian's wrath, only to have his loosened skin help him glide to safety.|$|E
5|$|The prickly shark has a <b>flabby</b> and {{cylindrical}} body, {{with the}} adults markedly bulkier than juveniles, and a short, moderately flattened head. The nostrils are placed far apart and preceded by small flaps of skin. The spiracles are tiny and positioned well behind the eyes, which lack nictitating membranes. The mouth forms a broad arch, with very short furrows at the corners. There are 21–25 and 20–27 tooth rows {{in the upper}} and lower jaws respectively. The knife-like teeth each have a strongly angled main cusp flanked by up to three smaller cusplets on either side; the lateral cusplets are absent in young sharks. There are five pairs of gill slits, with the fifth pair the longest.|$|E
5|$|Various {{anatomical}} {{features of}} the goblin shark, such as its <b>flabby</b> body and small fins, {{suggest that it is}} sluggish in nature. This species hunts for teleost fishes, cephalopods, and crustaceans both near the sea floor {{and in the middle of}} the water column. Its long snout is covered with ampullae of Lorenzini that enable it to sense minute electric fields produced by nearby prey, which it can snatch up by rapidly extending its jaws. Small numbers of goblin sharks are unintentionally caught by deepwater fisheries. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has assessed it as Least Concern, despite its rarity, citing its wide distribution and low incidence of capture.|$|E

50|$|Active voice makes {{subjects}} {{do something}} (to something); passive voice permits subjects {{to have something}} done to them (by someone or something). Some argue that active voice is more muscular, direct, and succinct, passive voice <b>flabbier,</b> more indirect, and wordier. If you want your words to seem impersonal, indirect, and noncommittal, passive is the choice, but otherwise, active voice is almost invariably likely to prove more effective.|$|R
5|$|The Pacific {{electric}} ray has a soft, <b>flabby</b> body devoid of dermal denticles. It has an oval pectoral fin disc about 1.2 times {{as wide as}} long, with a nearly straight front margin {{and a pair of}} kidney-shaped electric organs visible beneath the skin. The eyes are small and followed by smooth-rimmed spiracles; the space from the spiracles to the snout tip is about 1.8 times the distance between the spiracles. There is a curtain of skin between the nostrils that almost reaches the mouth, which is arched with deep furrows at the corners. The distance between the mouth and the snout tip is about equal to the mouth width, and three times that of the distance between the nostrils. There are 25–28 upper tooth rows and 19–26 lower tooth rows; each tooth is tiny and smooth, with a single sharp cusp.|$|E
5|$|Though seldom life-threatening, the {{electric}} discharge of an Atlantic torpedo is quite severe {{and may be}} enough to knock a person unconscious. However, a greater danger to divers is the disorientation that follows the shock. The Atlantic torpedo is of no commercial value, as its meat is <b>flabby</b> and tasteless. It is caught incidentally by commercial and recreational fisheries in bottom trawls and on hook-and-line. When caught at sea, it is generally discarded or cut up for bait. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) does not yet have enough data to assess the Atlantic torpedo beyond Data Deficient; it could be negatively affected by fishing mortality, though specific data on catch rates and population trends are lacking, {{as well as by}} the degradation of coral reefs that are important to juveniles. Its slow reproductive rate would limit its capacity to recover from population depletion.|$|E
5|$|With <b>flabby</b> {{muscles and}} a large oily liver, the false {{catshark}} is a slow-moving predator and scavenger {{of a variety of}} fishes and invertebrates. It has a viviparous mode of reproduction, featuring an unusual form of oophagy in which the developing embryos consume ova or egg fragments released by the mother and use the yolk material to replenish their external yolk sacs for later use. This species typically gives birth to two pups at a time. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) presently lacks sufficient data to assess the conservation status of the false catshark. While neither targeted by fisheries nor commercially valuable, it is caught incidentally by longlines and bottom trawls, and its low reproductive rate may render it susceptible to population depletion.|$|E

50|$|The {{relationship}} between the pear limpet and Spongites yendoi {{could be considered a}} form of mutualism. The limpet gets 85% of its nutritional needs by grazing on the coralline alga and leaves it in thin sheets with a damaged surface. The limpet is not present in the north of its range and in these areas the algal sheets are much thicker and <b>flabbier,</b> and develop protuberances. It has been observed that the thin form of the alga grows laterally five times as fast as the thick form and is less likely to be attacked by burrowing organisms, so the association between the two organisms may be mutually beneficial.|$|R

5|$|The {{deepwater}} stingray has a <b>flabby</b> body, with enlarged pectoral fins {{forming a}} disc usually {{longer than it}} is wide. The leading margins of the disc converge at a broad angle. The snout is thin and measures over six times {{as long as the}} diameter of the orbit; the snout tip protrudes slightly from the disc. The small eyes are positioned just ahead of the spiracles, which have angular posterior rims. The large, circular nostrils are placed close to the mouth, to which they are connected by a pair of broad grooves. Between the nostrils is a broad curtain of skin with a strongly fringed posterior margin. The wide, straight mouth contains 32–60 tooth rows in either jaw, increasing in number with age. Each tooth is small with a low, blunt cusp; in adult males the teeth at the center are sharp and backward-pointing. The five pairs of gill slits are small and placed beneath the disc.|$|E
25|$|They can {{be divided}} into <b>flabby</b> or robust body types. <b>Flabby</b> benthopelagic fishes are like bathopelagic fishes, they have a reduced body mass, and low {{metabolic}} rates, expending minimal energy as they lie and wait to ambush prey. An example of a <b>flabby</b> fish is the cusk-eel Acanthonus armatus, a predator with a huge head and a body that is 90% water. This fish has the largest ears (otoliths) and the smallest brain in relation to its body size of all known vertebrates.|$|E

50|$|On April 21, 1980, Ruiz {{appeared}} {{to win the}} Boston Marathon's female category {{with a time of}} 2:31:56. Her time would have been the fastest female time in Boston Marathon history as well as the third-fastest female time ever recorded in any marathon. However, suspicions mounted about Ruiz almost from the beginning. Men's winner Bill Rodgers, who had just won his third straight Boston Marathon, noticed that Ruiz could not recall many things that most runners know by heart, such as intervals and splits. Other observers noticed that Ruiz was not panting or coated in sweat, and her thighs were much <b>flabbier</b> and fatter than would be expected for a world-class runner. She later released stress-test results showing her resting heart rate as 76. Most female marathoners have a resting heart rate in the 50s or lower.|$|R
60|$|Late in {{the evening}} I heard the distant {{rumbling}} of wagons over bridges--a sound heard farther {{than almost any other}} at night--the baying of dogs, and sometimes again the lowing of some disconsolate cow in a distant barn-yard. In the mean-while all the shore rang with the trump of bullfrogs, the sturdy spirits of ancient wine-bibbers and wassailers, still unrepentant, trying to sing a catch in their Stygian lake--if the Walden nymphs will pardon the comparison, for though there are almost no weeds, there are frogs there--who would fain keep up the hilarious rules of their old festal tables, though their voices have waxed hoarse and solemnly grave, mocking at mirth, and the wine has lost its flavor, and become only liquor to distend their paunches, and sweet intoxication never comes to drown the memory of the past, but mere saturation and waterloggedness and distention. The most aldermanic, with his chin upon a heart-leaf, which serves for a napkin to his drooling chaps, under this northern shore quaffs a deep draught of the once scorned water, and passes round the cup with the ejaculation tr-r-r-oonk, tr-r-r--oonk, tr-r-r-oonk! and straightway comes over the water from some distant cove the same password repeated, where the next in seniority and girth has gulped down to his mark; and when this observance has made the circuit of the shores, then ejaculates the master of ceremonies, with satisfaction, tr-r-r-oonk! and each in his turn repeats the same down to the least distended, leakiest, and <b>flabbiest</b> paunched, that there be no mistake; and then the howl goes round again and again, until the sun disperses the morning mist, and only the patriarch is not under the pond, but vainly bellowing troonk from time to time, and pausing for a reply.|$|R
25|$|The Lazio {{region of}} Frascati {{is the source}} of the {{majority}} of plantings of Malvasia di Candia, a distinct sub-variety of Malvasia that is not part of the Malvasia bianca branch of the grape family. It is most often used for blending with the related Malvasia Puntinata and Malvasia di Lazio being more highly prized due to their higher acidity and tendency to produce less <b>flabby</b> wines.|$|E
25|$|The acidity in wine is an {{important}} component in the quality and taste of the wine. It adds a sharpness to the flavors and is detected most readily by a prickling sensation {{on the sides of the}} tongue and a mouth-watering aftertaste. Of particular importance is the balance of acidity versus the sweetness of the wine (the leftover residual sugar) and the more bitter components of the wine (most notably tannins but also includes other phenolics). A wine with too much acidity will taste excessively sour and sharp. A wine with too little acidity will taste <b>flabby</b> and flat, with less defined flavors.|$|E
25|$|The {{appearance}} of the megamouth is distinctive, but little else is known about it. It has a brownish-black colour on top, is white underneath, and has an asymmetrical tail with a long upper lobe, {{similar to that of}} the thresher shark. The interior of its gill slits are lined with finger-like gill rakers that capture its food. A relatively poor swimmer, the megamouth has a soft, <b>flabby</b> body and lacks caudal keels. The megamouth is considerably less active than the other filter-feeding sharks, the basking shark and the whale shark. The megamouth has a stout body and a long, wide bulbous head.|$|E
25|$|Brown {{catsharks}} have long, slender {{bodies with}} broad, bell-shaped snouts. They are dark brown with light-colored markings on the posterior margins of their fins.

The first dorsal fin originates {{to the front of the}} pelvic fin and the second dorsal fin is located in front of the anal fin's insertion. They typically reach a maximum size of 68cm in total length, but they average between 30 and 60cm.|$|E
25|$|The Chablis wine {{region has}} {{much in common}} with Champagne province, when it comes to climate. It has a semi-continental climate without {{maritime}} influence. The peak summer growing season can be hot; and wintertime can be long, cold and harsh, with frosty conditions lasting to early May. Years that experience too much rain and low temperature tend to produce wines excessively high in acidity and fruit that is too lean to support it. Vintages that are exceedingly warm tend to produce fat, <b>flabby</b> wines that are too low in acidity. Frost can be countered by heaters, and aspersion by sprinklers to form an ice layer. The exceptionally poor 1972 Chablis suffered frost at vintage time.|$|E
25|$|As {{sugar levels}} in the grape rise, acid levels fall. All wines need some degree of acidity {{in order to be}} {{balanced}} and avoid tasting <b>flabby</b> or dull. Acidity is also a key component in food and wine pairing so its presence in wine is important with winemakers trying to harvest grapes before acid levels fall too low. The stress to maintain acid levels is not as bearing {{due to the fact that}} winemakers can rectify the situation somewhat by later adding acids during the winemaking process (winemakers can also rectify deficiencies in sugar levels by chaptalization). However natural acids in the grape play other roles in the development of flavor and aroma compounds as well as fighting against the effects of spoilage organisms so the most ideal situation for winemakers is to try and harvest while acid levels are acceptable.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, as Pomerol's {{transition}} to a red wine producing district was completed, Cabernet Franc was the dominant grape variety. However, an early spring frost in 1956 killed {{a large portion of}} the Cabernet Franc plantings and many estates took this event as an opportunity to replant with the higher yielding and earlier ripening Merlot. Despite Merlot's tendency to suffer from coulure if the weather is cold and rainy during flowering, the grape quickly rose to prominence in Pomerol and has become the grape most closely associated with the region. Nevertheless, very few Pomerols are pure Merlot and Cabernet Franc is still valued for the tannic structure and acidity it gives, which can add longevity and aging potential to the wines. In fact, as the trend of the late 20th and early 21st century towards harvesting Merlot later and at increasingly higher sugar levels has continued, the role of Cabernet Franc in balancing the opulent but potentially <b>flabby</b> nature of over ripe Merlot has become even more appreciated by Pomerol winemakers.|$|E

500|$|The {{body of the}} marbled {{electric}} ray is soft and <b>flabby,</b> and entirely lacks dermal denticles. The thick pectoral fin disc is nearly circular and comprises about 59–67% of the total length; the paired kidney-shaped electric organs are visible beneath the skin, outside of the small eyes. Immediately posterior to each eye is a large, oval spiracle, which bears 6–8 long, finger-like projections on the rim that almost meet at the center. On the [...] "nape" [...] behind the spiracles, there are 5–7 prominent mucous pores. Between the nostrils, there is a quadrangular curtain of skin much broader than long, that almost reaches the small, arched mouth.

500|$|The Paul Whiteman Orchestra was {{the most}} popular and highest paid band of the day. In spite of Whiteman's nickname, [...] "The King of Jazz", his was not a jazz ensemble, but a popular music outfit that played bits of jazz and {{classical}} music according to the demands of its record-buying and concert-going audience. Whiteman was perhaps best known for having premiered George Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue in New York in 1924, and the orchestrator of that piece, Ferde Grofé, continued to be {{an important part of the}} band in 1928. At three hundred pounds, Whiteman was huge both physically and culturally—"a man <b>flabby,</b> virile, quick, coarse, untidy and sleek, with a hard core of shrewdness in an envelope of sentimentalism," [...] according to a 1926 New Yorker profile. And many Beiderbecke partisans have turned Whiteman into a villain in the years since.|$|E
500|$|Lansbury {{found little}} support in his fight for women's {{suffrage}} from [...] his parliamentary Labour colleagues, whom he dismissed as [...] "a weak, <b>flabby</b> lot". In parliament, he denounced the prime minister, H. H. Asquith, for the cruelties being inflicted on imprisoned suffragists: [...] "You are beneath contempt... {{you ought to}} be driven from public life". He was temporarily suspended from the House for [...] "disorderly conduct".

500|$|The unusual pear-like {{shape of}} the coffin ray distinguishes it from all other rays. Its body is <b>flabby,</b> with two large, {{kidney-shaped}} electric organs visible {{on both sides of}} the head. The pectoral fins form a greatly enlarged disc about as wide as long, that is thick at the center and thin at the margins. The leading margin of the disc is straight to gently concave. The eyes are minute and can be elevated on short stalks. Close behind the eyes and slightly larger are the spiracles, which are rimmed by small [...] in some individuals. The nostrils are located just ahead of the mouth, and are connected to it by a pair of broad grooves. Between the nostrils is a short curtain of skin that overlaps the mouth. The capacious mouth forms a very long, wide arch; the slender jaws can be distended dramatically, though are not particularly protrusible. Adults have over 60 rows of small teeth in either jaw; each tooth has three long cusps. The five pairs of gill slits are small and placed beneath the disc.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{interpreted}} as tackling a topical, ecologically-minded agenda, though McCarthy {{said it did}} so with a lightness of touch that granted the viewer the ability to accept or ignore the message. Kyle Smith of the New York Post, wrote that by depicting future humans as [...] "a <b>flabby</b> mass of peabrained idiots who are literally too fat to walk", WALL-E was darker and more cynical than any major Disney feature film he could recall. He compared the humans to the patrons of Disney's Parks and Resorts, adding, [...] "I'm also not sure I've ever seen a major corporation spend so much money to issue an insult to its customers." [...] Maura Judkis of U.S. News & World Report questioned whether this depiction of [...] "frighteningly obese humans" [...] would resonate with children and make them prefer to [...] "play outside rather than {{in front of the}} computer, to avoid a similar fate". The interpretation led to criticism of the film by conservative commentators such as Glenn Beck, and contributors to National Review Online including Shannen W. Coffin and Jonah Goldberg (although he admitted it was a [...] "fascinating" [...] and occasionally [...] "brilliant" [...] production).|$|E

500|$|The body {{is fairly}} slender and <b>flabby.</b> The two dorsal fins {{are similar in}} size and shape, both being small and rounded. The {{pectoral}} fins are also rather small and rounded. The pelvic and anal fins have long bases and are larger than the dorsal fins. The caudal peduncle is flattened from side-to-side and lacks keels or notches. The asymmetric caudal fin has a long upper lobe with a shallow ventral notch near the tip, and an indistinct lower lobe. The soft, semitranslucent skin has a rough texture from a covering of dermal denticles, each shaped like a short upright spine with lengthwise ridges. In life, this species is pink or tan due to visible blood vessels beneath the skin; the color deepens with age, and young sharks may be almost white. The fins' margins are translucent gray or blue, and the eyes are black with bluish streaks in the iris. After death, the coloration quickly fades to dull gray or brown. Adult sharks usually measure between [...] long. However, the capture of an enormous female estimated at [...] long in 2000 showed this species can grow far larger than previously suspected.

500|$|Whitney Balliett {{stated that}} Flanagan {{was the most}} {{consistent}} of the pianists influenced by Wilson, Tatum and Cole, and invariably created something new in his playing: he [...] "often states the melody with dissonant, levering chords played offbeat or staccato. Never decorative, they [...] reveal both a respect for the melody and an intense desire to alter it"; during his main improvising, he used [...] "interval-filled descending figures [...] charging rhythmic phrases whose accented first notes make the succeeding notes snap, double-time phrases that race ahead to clear the way, and legato phrases that form sauntering rear guards." [...] In a review of a 1989 concert, Feather commented that Flanagan used [...] "subtle dynamic shadings", while [...] "bursts of upsweeping chords sometimes lent an element of surprise, with a nimble left hand offering graceful filigree fills" [...] and occasional musical quotes that added humor. Other techniques he employed were, in Stanley Crouch's description, [...] "crooning effects achieved by manipulating the pedals, holding down keys long enough to sustain notes in decisively different ways, and working out inflections that evoke the voice – sighs, moans, swells, purrs". Critic John S. Wilson described Flanagan's solo piano style on ballads in 1978: [...] "He drifts through ballads with a dreamy langourous flow, {{but it is not}} a soft or <b>flabby</b> style. There is, beneath the surface, a vitality that gives it a lean, swinging character".|$|E
