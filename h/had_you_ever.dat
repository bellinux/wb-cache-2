I only hope that we may stay here for some time. The best of it is that these good people evidently do not regard us as a burden. No doubt they are pleased to oblige the Duke of Burgundy, but, beyond that, their welcome seemed really sincere. Now let us see our bedroom.

6000|$|Before sunset {{this evening}} I {{went to look}} at Mary's grave. The turf has grown so green since I saw it last, and the flowers are {{springing}} up so prettily. A bird was perched dressing his feathers on the low white headstone that bears the inscription of her name and age. I did not go near enough to disturb the little creature. He looked innocent and pretty on the grave, as Mary herself was in her lifetime. When he flew away I went and sat for a little by the headstone, and read the mournful lines on it. Oh, my love! my love! what harm or wrong <b>had</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> done in this world, that you should die at eighteen by a blow from a drunkard's hand? ...|$|E

The free men, {{if you could have}} understood it, they are the wise men; the patient, self-denying, valiant; the Nobles of the World; who can discern the Law of this Universe, what it is, and piously obey it; these, in late sad times, having cast you loose, you are fallen captive to greedy sons of profit-and-loss; to bad and ever to worse; and at length to Beer and the Devil.

I {{have not}} been in London to-day: for Dr. Gastrell(8) and I dined, by invitation, with the Dean of Carlisle, my neighbour; so I know not {{what they are doing}} in the world, a mere country gentleman. And are not you ashamed both to go into the country just when I did, and stay ten days, just as I did, saucy monkeys? But I never rode; I had no horses, and our coach was out of order, and we went and came in a hired one. Do you keep your lodgings when you go to Wexford? I suppose you do; for you will hardly stay above two months. I have been walking about our town to-night, and it is a very scurvy place for walking.

6000|$|What comedian but Moliére has {{combined}} with such depths--with the indignation of Alceste, the self-deception of Tartufe, the blasphemy of Don Juan--such wildness of irresponsible mirth, such humour, such wit! Even now, {{when more than}} two hundred years have sped by, when so much water has flowed under the bridges and has borne away so many trifles of contemporary mirth (cetera fluminis ritu feruntur), even now we never laugh so well as when Mascarille and Vadius and M. Jourdain tread the boards in the Maison de Moliére. Since those mobile dark brows of yours ceased to make men laugh, since your voice denounced the 'demoniac' manner of contemporary tragedians, I take leave to think that no player has been more worthy to wear the canons of Mascarille or the gown of Vadius than M. Coquelin of the Comédie Francaise. In him you have a successor to your Mascarille so perfect, that the ghosts of play-goers of your date might cry, could they see him, that Moliére had come again. But, with all respect to the efforts of the fair, I doubt if Mdlle. Barthet, or Mdme. Croizette herself, would reconcile the town to the loss of the fair De Brie, and Madeleine, and the first, the true Céliméne, Armande.

30|$|During expert {{committee}} review, {{a bilingual}} clinical expert reviewed the synthesis document of T 1 and T 2 translations and {{compared it to}} the source English language survey. This allowed issues of translation to be further assessed, and the subsequent discussion of key translated terms {{that needed to be}} conceptually aligned with the source language. One issue arose during expert committee review from the synthesis report with the question: “Before this test was described, <b>had</b> <b>you</b> <b>ever</b> heard of a home stool test” as it was translated without the word “before”, and thus the meaning differed. Therefore, the wording was changed to be clear on what the question was asking with the inclusion of a term that made the question conceptually aligned.|$|E

Can’t we generate solar thermal {{energy in the form}} of low grade heat of 70 - 80. c with 20. c ambient temp. Yes this paper suggests a solution of storing the solar energy only by constructing a simple pool of salt water,isn’t it amazing?. Thus a solar pond is a pool of salt water which serves as the solar energy collection and sensible heat storage. The solar ponds made a tremendous progress in the last thirty years. This paper also mainly reviews the basic principles of the solar pond and the problems encountered in its operation and its maintenance. Here we also discuss the factors that enhance the heat storing capacities and also the factors that influence the technical and the economical viability of the solar ponds...|$|E
