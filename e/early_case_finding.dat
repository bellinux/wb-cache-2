40|$|Abstract Background Since 2005, Cambodia’s {{national}} tuberculosis programme {{has been}} conducting active case finding (ACF) with mobile radiography units, targeting household contacts of TB patients in poor and vulnerable communities in addition to routine passive case finding (PCF). This paper examines {{the differences in the}} demographic characteristics, smear grades, and treatment outcomes of pulmonary TB cases detected through both active and passive case finding to determine if ACF could contribute to <b>early</b> <b>case</b> <b>finding,</b> considering associated project costs for ACF. Methods Demographic characteristics, smear grades, and treatment outcomes were compared between actively (n[*]=[*] 405) and passively (n[*]=[*] 602) detected patients by reviewing the existing programme records (including TB registers) of 2009 and 2010. Additional analyses were performed for PCF cases detected after the ACF sessions (n[*]=[*] 91). Results The overall cost per case detected through ACF was US$ 108. The ACF approach detected patients from older populations (median age of 55 years) compared to PCF (median age of 48 years; p[*] Conclusions The community-based ACF in Cambodia was found to be a cost-effective activity that is likely to have additional benefits such as contribution to <b>early</b> <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> and detection of patients from a vulnerable age group, possibly with an extended benefit for reducing secondary cases in the community. Further investigations are required to clarify the primary benefits of ACF in early and increased case detection and to assess its secondary impact on reducing on-going transmission. </p...|$|E

40|$|Drug-resistant {{tuberculosis}} (TB) is a {{major threat}} to global public health. Patients with extensively drug-resistant TB (XDR-TB), particularly those with HIV-coinfection, experience high and accelerated mortality with limited available interventions. To determine modifiable factors associated with survival, we evaluated XDR-TB patients from a community-based hospital in rural South Africa where a large number of XDR-TB cases were first detected. A retrospective case control study was conducted of XDR-TB patients diagnosed from 2005 - 2008. Survivors, those alive at 180 days from diagnostic sputum collection date, were compared with controls who died within 180 days. Clinical, laboratory and microbiological correlates of survival were assessed in 69 survivors (median survival 565 days [IQR 384 - 774] and 73 non-survivors (median survival 34 days [IQR 18 - 90]). Among 129 HIV+ patients, multivariate analyses of modifiable factors demonstrated that negative AFB smear (AOR 8. 4, CI 1. 84 - 38. 21), a lower laboratory index of routine laboratory findings (AOR 0. 48, CI 0. 22 - 1. 02), CD 4 > 200 cells/mm(3) (AOR 11. 53, 1. 1 - 119. 32), and receipt of antiretroviral therapy (AOR 20. 9, CI 1. 16 - 376. 83) were independently associated with survival from XDR-TB. Survival from XDR-TB with HIV-coinfection is associated with less advanced stages of both diseases at time of diagnosis, absence of laboratory markers indicative of multiorgan dysfunction, and provision of antiretroviral therapy. Survival can be increased by addressing these modifiable risk factors through policy changes and improved clinical management. Health planners and clinicians should develop programmes focusing on <b>earlier</b> <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> and integration of HIV and drug-resistant TB diagnostic, therapeutic, and preventive activities...|$|R

Early detection of COPD may improve the outcome by timely smoking cessation, {{a change in}} lifestyle, and treatment with an inhaled bronchodilator (BD). The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the diagnostic role of BD reversibility testing in <b>early</b> COPD <b>case</b> <b>finding.</b> Methods: General practitioners (n= 241) consecutively recruited subjects aged ≥ 35 years with relevant exposure (history of smoking, and/or occupational exposure) and at least one respiratory symptom. Information on age, smoking status, body mass index, dyspnea score (Medical Research Council scale), and spirometry was obtained. Individuals with airway obstruction (forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV 1]/forced vital capacity [FVC] 0. 20 L and > 12 %. Asthma and COPD were, respectively, defined as an FEV 1 increase > 0. 50 L and a post-BD FEV 1 /FVC < 0. 70. Results: In total, 4, 049 subjects (51 % male) were included (mean age 58 years, body mass index 27, 32 pack-years of smoking). A significant BD response was found in 143 (15 %) of the 937 subjects (23 %) with airway obstruction at screening spirometry. In 59 % of these subjects, the post-BD FEV 1 /FVC remained < 0. 70. In 24 % of the subjects with pre-BD airway obstruction, the post-BD FEV 1 /FVC ratio was within the reference range. In subjects with confirmed COPD, the mean increase in FEV 1 following BD was 0. 11 L± 0. 10 L. The subjects with COPD and a significant BD response were characterized by a higher prevalence of dyspnea (72 % versus 57 %, P= 0. 02) but less cough (55 % versus 75 %, P= 0. 001) when compared with COPD subjects without BD reversibility. Conclusion: Administration of a BD in COPD <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> is important in order to determine the post-BD FEV 1 /FVC ratio.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} racial differences in health status and sociodemographic characteristics for injured black and white infants. Data were analyzed from the 1988 Maternal and Infant Health Surveys conducted by the National Center for Health Statistics. Injured infants (N= 315) were randomly matched with uninjured infants. The injured infants from both racial groups were more often male and had younger mothers than the uninjured infants. Injured white infants also were more likely to be on public assistance as compared to noninjured white infants. The presence of colic and irritability during the first month of life was significant for both black and white injured groups. Logistic regression analysis showed that irritability was predictive of injury occurrence in both groups. Nursing implications include <b>early</b> <b>case</b> <b>finding,</b> injury prevention education, public policy advocacy, and injury research. Although all families with infants should be targeted for injury prevention education, a special emphasis should be placed on families with infants that have a predictably higher probability of being injured, as discussed in this study.

The incidence rate of neuroblastoma in Quebec is at least 1 per 10, 330 live births, higher than that of all other diseases responding to early treatment except congenital hypothyroidism screened for in the Quebec Network of Genetic Medicine. The feasibility of chemical screening of urine for elevated levels of homovanillic acid and vanillylmandelic acid in Quebec was assessed. The cost-effectiveness of screening 100, 000 infants per year would be high (cost-benefit ratio 2. 4), with a net saving of about $ 280, 000 and eight lives per year. The estimated cost of adding neuroblastoma screening to the existing urine metabolite screening program is $ 70, 700. The apparent sensitivity of the proposed test is 0. 859 and the rate of false-positive results about 0. 1 %, both acceptable values.

Two compartmental models and one individual-based model have been described in the literature. Both compartmental models investigate the course of leprosy in populations and the long-term impact of control strategies. The individual-based model focusses on transmission within households and the impact of case finding among contacts of new leprosy patients. Major improvement of these models should result from a better understanding of individual differences in exposure to infection and developing leprosy after exposure. Most relevant are contact heterogeneity, heterogeneity in susceptibility and spatial heterogeneity. Furthermore, the existing models have only been applied to a limited number of countries. Parameterization of the models for other areas, in particular those with high incidence, is essential to support current initiatives for the global elimination of leprosy.

Eight municipalities participated. Citizens fulfilling national case finding recommendations, age ≥ 35 years, smokers/ex-smokers/relevant occupational exposure, and at least one respiratory symptom, were invited to spirometry. Citizens with indication of pulmonary obstruction, forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) /forced vital capacity (FVC) < 0. 70, were referred to their general practitioner (GP). Results. 1, 499 citizens were examined (53. 6 % male, mean age 57. 2 years). 44. 8 % were current smokers with 57 % planning for smoking cessation. The citizens recorded significant airway symptoms with dyspnea being the most important (71 %).

40|$|Background: Tuberculosis is a {{major public}} health problem {{throughout}} the world. Nearly {{one third of the}} world’s population is infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and hence at risk of developing active disease. Tuberculosis {{is a major}} cause of morbidity and mortality in Ethiopia, and the country belongs {{to one of the most}} affected high burden countries. Objective: To determine the prevalence of smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) and some associated risk factors among suspected patients attending Metehara sugar factory hospital, East Showa, Ethiopia. Methodology: A cross- sectional study was conducted from March 25 to May 30 / 2011 on 113 pulmonary tuberculosis suspected participants. Socio demographic and risk factors data were collected by using questionnaire. Sputum samples from tuberculosis suspects were collected, processed by sodium hypochlorite (bleach) centrifugation sedimentation concentration technique, stained by Ziehl-Neelsen staining and examined by Microscopy. Result: The overall prevalence of smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis was 14. 2 %. Statistical significant association was observed between age, family size, history of contact with chronic coughers (TB infected patients), smoking habit and alcoholism with pulmonary tuberculosis (P< 0. 05). Conclusion: The prevalence of smear positive pulmonary tuberculosis is high in Metehara sugar factory hospital. The magnitude is higher in the economically productive age group.

Main outcome measure Audio recorded consultations and interviews with patients and healthcare professionals along with observation field notes were thematically analysed. We assessed outcomes of <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> from patient records. Results <b>Case</b> <b>finding</b> exacerbated the discordance between patient and professional agendas, the latter already dominated by the tightly structured and time-limited nature of chronic illness reviews. Professional beliefs and abilities affected how <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> was undertaken; there was uncertainty about how to ask the questions, particularly among nursing staff. Professionals were often wary of opening an emotional ‘can of worms’. Subsequently, patient responses potentially suggesting emotional problems could be prematurely shut down by professionals. Patients did not understand why they were asked questions about depression.

Between 15 March and 17 May 1988, 951 cases of cholera were registered at the cholera treatment centre in a Mozambican refugee camp in Malawi. The epidemic duration was 65 days. Vibrio cholerae biotype E 1 Tor serotype Inaba was isolated. To identify high-risk groups and potential risk of acquiring the disease, an epidemiologic investigation was conducted. The attack rate of recorded cases was 2. 6 % with a range from 0. 9 to 5. 1 % for different sections of the camp. The case fatality rate was 3. 3 % and decreased from week 1 to week 6. The epidemic started in the section near the market place and radiated out. A matched-pair case-control study {{of food and water}} consumption was performed early in the outbreak.

The first study showed screening of new immigrants upon entry met the criteria for risk group screening of more than 50 per 100, 000 population. Abnormalities in the chest-X-ray without the presence of active TB was a powerful predictor {{of the development of}} TB during the following 2 years. In those with a normal chest X-ray, bi-annual follow-up screening met the criteria for risk group screening only for immigrants from countries with an estimated TB incidence of more than 200 per 100, 000 population. The second study showed the added value of interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) for the diagnosis of latent TB infection (LTBI). When used to confirm the diagnosis of LTBI after a tuberculin skin reaction of 5 mm or more, IGRA reduced the number needed to treat to prevent a new TB patient with 60 %. The third study showed Dutch TB control effectively detects and prevents TB among children. Improving coverage of BCG-vaccination and screening of immigrant children for LTBI will prevent further TB cases. The final studies describe the trends in target groups for screening, and independent risk factors for acceptance, completion and the occurrence of adverse events of preventive treatment on LTBI. Preventive treatment has the largest impact on TB incidence in the two years after LTBI diagnosis among TB contacts and children younger than 5 years...|$|E
40|$|While {{maternal}} mortality represents a readily identifiable outcome measure for women’s health, estimating {{the burden of}} gynaecological disease is more problematic. However, the importance of including gynaecology and care for non-pregnant women within the remit of Primary Health Care has been suggested {{more than a decade}} ago. Since then, various studies have used self report in population based morbidity surveys, purposive laboratory studies and ‘syndromic ’ approaches to estimate prevalence rates. Routine health facility data, although flawed, represent another complimentary source. For policy development, a critical overview is required to identify firstly the extent of a systematic list of gynaecological conditions, and secondly the social burden of these diseases which clearly {{have an impact on the}} quality of the lives of women in developing countries. A prototype categorization of gynaecological conditions relevant to the developing world is presented.

Primary care is {{an important}} setting for <b>case</b> <b>finding.</b> Objectives. To estimate the cost utility of <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> for hepatitis C in primary care, spe-cifically amongst former injecting drug users (IDUs). Methods. A Markov model was developed to investigate the impact of <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> and treat-ment on progression of hepatitis C (HCV) in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 former IDUs. Com-parison was made with a similar cohort in which no systematic <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> was implemented but spontaneous presentation for testing was allowed. Two scenarios were explored. The testing protocol utilized ELISA and PCR tests. Those eligible for treatment received combina-tion therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin. Parameter estimates were obtained from literature searches and experts in the field. Results. Few estimates of the uptake of HCV testing in primary care are available. Cost utility was estimated at around £ 16 000 /QALY for both scenarios. At a willingness to pay of £ 30 000 / QALY, there is approximately a 75 % probability that the initiatives would be cost-effective. Choices regarding the utility data, discounting and the rates of spontaneous/re-presentation outside of a case-finding programme appear to be important areas of uncertainty in this model.

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of tuberculosis (TB) among children {{has long been}} neglected {{as a public health}} concern. However, any child with TB is a sentinel event indicating recent transmission. Vaccination, <b>early</b> <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> and treatment of those latently infected with TB can prevent cases, severe morbidity and unnecessary death. The objective {{of the study was to}} describe the {{occurrence of}} TB events among children in the Netherlands which may be avoided through preventive measures. For this purpose we performed a trend analysis of routine Dutch TB and LTBI (surveillance data in 1993 - 2012 and a descriptive analysis of children with TB and with LTBI diagnosed in 2005 - 2012). Overall childhood TB incidence has declined over the last two decades from 3. 6 in 1993 to 1. 9 per 100, 000 children in 2012. The decline was stronger among Dutch-born children compared to foreign-born children. In 2005 - 2012 64 % of childhood TB cases were detected through active case finding. Foreign-born children with TB were less likely to be detected through active case finding, when not detected through post-entry TB screening. Childhood TB diagnosis was culture confirmed in 68 % of passively detected cases and 12 % of actively detected cases. Of 1, 049 children with LTBI started on preventive treatment in 2005 - 2012, 90 % completed treatment. In 37 % of all childhood TB cases there was at least one 'missed opportunity' for prevention. Thirty nine percent of child TB patients eligible for BCG were not vaccinated. Children with TB in the Netherlands are generally detected at an early stage and treatment completion rates are high. However, more TB cases among children can be prevented through enhancing TB case finding and screening and preventive treatment of latent TB infection among migrant children, and improving the coverage of BCG vaccination among eligible risk group...|$|E
40|$|Background: Blindness from {{glaucoma}} {{is associated}} with socio-economic deprivation, presumed to reflect poor access to care and poor adherence to treatment. Objectives: To determine why people with glaucoma are presenting late for treatment and to understand access to glaucoma care. Additionally, we sought to identify what patients and the community know, do {{and think about the}} condition and why the poor are the most affected with glaucoma blindness. Design: Study participants were from four communities and two hospitals in Abuja-FCT and Kaduna State, Nigeria. A total of 120 participants were involved, including 8 focus group discussions, 7 in-depth interviews with blind/visually impaired glaucoma patients, 5 rapid direct observation visits with these patients and 13 exit interviews of glaucoma patients in the hospital. The data were analysed using content analysis, interpreting participant experiences in terms of three key steps conceptualised as important in the care pathway: what it takes to know glaucoma, to reach a diagnosis and to access continued care. Results: This article presents multiple narratives of accessing and maintaining glaucoma care and how people manage and cope with the disease. People may be presenting late due to structural barriers, which include lack of knowledge and awareness about glaucoma and not finding an appropriately equipped health care facility. What keeps glaucoma patients within the care pathway are a good hospital experience; a support structure involving family, counselling and shared patients’ experiences; and an informed choice of treatment, as well as agency. The high cost of purchasing care is a major factor for patients dropping out of treatment. Conclusion: The findings suggest the need to address economic and social structural drivers as glaucoma presents another case study to demonstrate that poverty is a strong driver for blindness.

The results indicated that children from violent families demonstrated significantly more behavior problems and had less social interaction than children from non-violent families as reported by their mothers. According to mother-reports and self-reports there was no significant difference on measures of anxiety, depression, and aggression. However, the Robert 2 ̆ 7 s Apperception Test for Children, a projective test, indicated significant differences between children from violent families and the comparison group on anxiety and aggression. While mean scores for depression were higher on all measures (mother-reports, self-reports, projective test), they were not significant. Finally, children from violent families were found to be significantly less able to utilize adaptive coping skills than children from non-violent families. Children from violent families were able to identify problem situations, but relied on atypical responses and maladaptive responses or left problems unresolved significantly more often than children from the comparison group. ^ Thus, significant differences between children exposed to family violence and the comparison group were found on psychosocial variables of behavior problems and social interactions, feelings of anxiety and aggression, and use of adaptive and maladaptive coping strategies. What seems most important to consider when assessing these children is the discrepancy between their outward and their inner concerns. Early evaluation and treatment of these children are seen as important interventions to minimize the effects of living in a violent family and interrupt the intergenerational cycle of violence. Since <b>early</b> <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> is of particular importance school and community agency personnel should be trained regarding possible signs and symptoms of family violence. ...|$|E

40|$|Blöðruhálskirtilskrabbamein er í dag algengasta krabbamein meðal karlmanna bæði á Íslandi og í Danmörku. Í byrjun 10. áratugar síðustu aldar kom fram á sjónarsviðið svokallað PSA-blóðpróf. PSA er stytting á heitinu {{prostate}} specific antigen en það er sameind sem blöðruhálskirtilinn framleiðir. Hækkað blóðgildi PSA getur gefið til kynna að blöðruhálskrabbamein sé til staðar. PSA er hins vegar ekki sértækt fyrir krabbamein og getur einnig mælst hækkað í öðrum algengum kvillum í blöðruhálskirtlinum s. s. bólgu og góðkynja stækkun. Fljótlega eftir innleiðingu PSA-blóðprófsins kom í ljós að norrænir heilbrigðisstarfsmenn notuðu prófið mismikið til að greina blöðruhálskirtilskrabbamein á frumstigi. Öll Norðurlöndin búa yfir lýðgrundaðri krabbameinskrá. Faraldsfræðilegar rannsóknir, byggðar á gögnum úr þessum krabbameinsskrám, hafa sýnt fram á verulegan mun á nýgengi og lifun meðal norrænna sjúklinga með blöðruhálskirtilskrabbamein. Í Danmörku reyndist nýgengi blöðruhálskirtils– krabbameins vera lægra, auk þess sem þessi sjúklingahópur lifði mun skemur. Aftur á móti hefur dánartíðni blöðruhálskirtilskrabbameinssjúklinga meðal Norðurlandaþjóðanna haldist svipuð frá miðjum 9. áratug síðustu aldar. Þessi doktorsritgerð felur í sér rannsókn sem skoðar sérstaklega þá sjúklinga sem greindust með blöðruhálskirtilskrabbamein kringum árið 1997 en þá var Danmörk enn sér á báti varðandi nýgengi og lifun. Á rannsóknartímabilinu var blöðruhálskirtilskrabbamein þegar orðið algengasta krabbamein meðal íslenskra karlmanna en var í þriðja sæti meðal krabbameina hjá dönskum karlmönnum. Faraldsfræðilegar rannsóknir byggðar á gögnum frá krabbameinsskrám hafa ekki innihaldið klínískar upplýsingar og með því að afla þeirra á kerfisbundinn hátt veitir ritgerðin frekari skýringar á þessum mismun. Ennfremur er í ritgerðinni framkvæmt gæðamat á þeim klínísku upplýsingum sem höfðu verið tilkynntar til dönsku krabbameinskrárinnar kringum 1997 varðandi danska sjúklinga með blöðruhálskirtilskrabbamein. Helstu niðurstöður sem komu fram í rannsókninni eru eftirfarandi: Hlutfallsleg lifun sjúklingaþýða rannsóknarinnar var sambærileg við fyrri rannsóknir sem byggja á almennum gögnum úr krabbameinsskrám. Munurinn á hlutfalli sjúklinga með fjarmeinvörp við greiningu úskýrði að mestu leyti muninn á hlutfallslegri lifun milli landanna. Þegar leiðrétt var fyrir öðrum þáttum, s. s. i útbreiðslu sjúkdómsins, æxlisstigi (T-stigi) og PSA gildi, minnkaði eða hvarf munirinn alveg. Flestir þeirra sjúklinga sem greindust með staðbundið blöðruhálskirtils– krabbamein í Danmörku og á Íslandi höfðu upphaflega leitað læknis vegna neðri þvagvegaeinkenna. Í Danmörku var greiningin að langmestu leyti staðfest með heflun úr blöðruhálskirtlinum (TURP) en á Íslandi með grófnálarsýni úr blöðruhálskirtlinum. Íslensku sjúklingarnir voru yngri og fleiri greindust á fyrstu stigum sjúkdómsins, auk þess sem uppvinnsla þeirra var ítarlegri. Læknanleg meðferð og hormónameðferð var oftar veitt á Íslandi. Svipuð þróun og hafði átt sér stað á Íslandi sást um fimm árum síðar í Danmörku, þ. e. hækkun á nýgengi blöðruhálskirtilskrabbameins, breytt aldursdreifing og hækkun á hlutfalli staðbundins krabbameins. Upplýsingar um stigun og meðferð sem bárust dönsku krabbameinsskránni voru ónákvæmar. Þetta kann að rýra gæði þeirra rannsókna sem byggjast eingöngu á gögnum frá krabbameinsskrám. Greiningardagur, sem tilkynntur var til dönsku krabbameinskrárinnar og sá sem skráður var úr sjúkragögnum, var sá hinn sami í 70 % tilvika. Hins vegar höfðu um 95 % tilfella minni en þriggja mánaða mun á tímasetningu greiningardags. Leiðrétting fyrir greiningardegi hafði engin áhrif á lifun. Loks sýnir ritgerðin fram á að lifun danskra manna sem greindust með blöðruhálskirtilskrabbamein hefur aukist marktækt frá árinu 1997 fram til tímabilsins 2007 - 2013.

Each Nordic {{country has}} a population-based cancer registry {{dating back to the}} 1940 s or 1950 s, and the notification of a cancer diagnosis is mandatory. With the advent of prostate-specific antigen level (PSA) testing in the early 1990 s, Nordic countries differed in their approach towards early detection of prostate cancer (PC) and treatment. This was reflected in differences in PC incidence in the nineties with higher incidence in all the Nordic countries except in Denmark. Register-based studies showed survival differences among PC patients, with poorer outcomes in Denmark. The aim of this project was to shed a light on this difference by gathering clinical data that could facilitate the interpretation of incidence and mortality trends, elucidate reasons for differences in survival, and evaluate the quality of register-based data. In Paper I, the survival of a population-based Icelandic cohort and counterparts for the Danish and Swedish populations are analysed by comparing various clinical parameters. In Paper II, only Danish and Icelandic cases with localised disease are compared. Paper III studies the incidence and mortality trends in Denmark based on register data, and Paper IV comprises a quality assessment of register data. Paper V compares the survival of patients with metastatic PC in two different time periods in Denmark. Relative survival in the study cohorts is comparable to previous populationbased studies. Significant differences in excess mortality rates are found across countries, which diminish or disappear after adjustment for patient characteristics, e. g. metastatic status, clinical tumour stage (T stage) and PSA level. A difference in the proportion of patients with metastatic disease is the main explanation of the differences in survival rates among countries, while the incidence rates of metastatic cancer are similar. Among patients with localised PC in Denmark and Iceland, lower urinary tract symptoms (LUTS) were the predominant clinical presentation. Diagnosis was commonly confirmed by transurethral resection of the prostate (TURP) in Denmark, whereas in Iceland with Tru-cut biopsies. The Icelandic patients were younger, and a fivefold higher proportion of them were diagnosed with stage T 1 c. A higher proportion underwent bone imaging, had a normal PSA value and tumours of low Gleason grade. Treatment with curative intent and endocrine treatment were more common in Iceland. By stratifying according to M-stage, patients without metastatic disease had comparable outcomes during the first 4 years of follow-up; thereafter, survival of Danish patients was significantly poorer. A significant difference in survival of patients with unknown metastatic status was apparent during the entire follow-up period. The changes in incidence rates in the 3 Nordic countries resemble those observed in Europe and the USA, reflecting first a {{rise in the number of}} TURP iv procedures, but later an exponential rise in the use of PSA testing. A conservative approach towards <b>early</b> <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> in Denmark in the early 1990 s contributed to the vast differences observed in incidence and survival. Radical prostatectomy became a routine procedure in Iceland around 1990 and was implemented in Denmark around 1995. The introduction of this radical treatment option along with an increase in public awareness of PC resulted in a sharp rise in PC incidence in both countries. Throughout the period studied, mortality rates have been similar in all 3 Nordic countries. Paper III shows that changes in age distribution and clinical stage in Denmark, especially among younger patients, indicated a shift towards a more active diagnostic policy after 1995. Danish Cancer Register (DCR) information on stage and treatment was found to be inaccurate and can reduce the quality of register-based studies. Date of diagnosis between the DCR and hospital papers matched in 70 % of cases, though in 95 % of cases, the difference was less than 3 months. Correction of dates of diagnosis had no impact on survival. Peer Reviewe...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Tuberculosis (TB) case {{detection}} remains low in many countries, {{compromising the}} efficacy of TB control efforts. Current global TB control policy emphasizes <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> through sputum smear microscopy for patients who self-report to primary health centers. Our objective {{was to assess the}} feasibility and yield of a simple active <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> strategy in a high incidence population in northern Lima, Peru. METHODS: We implemented this pilot strategy in one health center's catchment area. Health workers visited household contacts of new TB case subjects to identify symptomatic individuals and collect sputum for screening. Neighboring households were screened in the same manner. Secondary analyses measured risk of TB by (1) sputum smear status of the index case subject, (2) compliance with testing, and (3) risk factors for disease detected through active contact tracing in contrast to self-report. RESULTS: The TB prevalence detected through combined active and passive <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> among 1, 094 household contacts was 0. 91 % (914 per 100, 000), much higher than with passive <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> alone (0. 18 %; 183 per 100, 000; p= 0. 02). Among 2, 258 neighbors, the combined strategy detected a TB prevalence of 0. 22 % (221 per 100, 000) in contrast to 0. 08 % (80 per 100, 000) detected through passive <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> alone (p= 0. 25). Risk factors for being diagnosed through active <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> in contrast with self-report included age > 55 years (odds ratio [OR]= 5. 5; 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 2, 22. 8) and female gender (OR= 3. 9; 95 % CI 0. 99, 22. 3). CONCLUSIONS: Risk of active TB among symptomatic household contacts of active case subjects in this community is very high.

PITC was introduced in six HFs in 2009 - 2010. HIV testing rate and <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> were compared between phase 1 (pre-PITC) and phase 3 (PITC period) for outpatient-department (OPD) attendees only, and for OPD and voluntary counseling & testing (VCT) departments combined. Out of 26, 367 adult OPD attendees in phase 1, 4. 7 % were tested and out of 29, 864 attendees in phase 3, 17. 0 % were tested (p[*] <[*] 0. 001). The proportion of HIV cases diagnosed was 0. 25 % (67 / 26, 367) in phase 1 and 0. 46 % (136 / 29864) in phase 3 (p[*] <[*] 0. 001). In multivariable analysis, both testing rate and <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> were significantly higher in phase 3 for OPD attendees. In phase 1 most of the HIV testing was done in VCT departments rather than at the OPD (78. 6 % vs 21. 4 % respectively); in phase 3 this was reversed (40. 0 % vs 60. 0 %; p[*] <[*] 0. 001).

40|$|Background: Policies {{of active}} <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> for {{cardiovascular}} disease (CVD) prevention in healthy adults are common, but economic evaluation has not investigated targeting such strategies {{at those who}} are most likely to benefit. Aim: To assess the cost effectiveness of targeted <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> for CVD prevention. Design and setting: Cost-effectiveness modelling in an English primary care population. Method: A cohort of 10 000 individuals aged 30 – 74 years and without existing CVD or diabetes was sampled from The Health Improvement Network database, a large primary care database. A discrete-event simulation was used to model the process of inviting people for assessment, assessing cardiovascular risk, and initiation and persistence with drug treatment. Risk factors and drug cessation rates were obtained from primary care data. Published sources provided estimates of uptake of assessment, treatment initiation, and treatment effects. The researchers determined the lifetime costs and quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) with opportunistic <b>case</b> <b>finding,</b> and strategies prioritising and targeting patients by age or prior estimate of cardiovascular risk. This study reports on the optimum strategy if a QALY is valued at £ 20 000. Results: Compared with no <b>case</b> <b>finding,</b> inviting all adults aged 30 – 74 years in a population of 10 000 yields 30. 32 QALYs at a total cost of £ 705 732. The optimum strategy is to rank patients by prior risk estimate and invite 8 % of those who are assessed as being at highest risk (those at ? 12. 76 % predicted 10 -year CVD risk), yielding 17. 53 QALYs at a cost of £ 162 280. There is an 89. 4 % probability that the optimum strategy is to invite < 35 % of patients for assessment.

In 78 eligible studies, the number of people with tuberculosis detected during intensified <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> varied substantially between countries and target groups of patients. Median prevalence of newly diagnosed tuberculosis was 0 · 7 % in population-based surveys, 2 · 2 % in contact-tracing studies, 2 · 3 % in mines, 2 · 3 % in programmes preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV, 2 · 5 % in prisons, 8 · 2 % in medical and antiretroviral treatment clinics, and 8 · 5 % in voluntary counselling and testing services.

40|$|Hepatitis C virus {{infection}} (HCV) is a viral {{liver disease}} affecting approximately 3 % of the world’s population and 0. 1 to 0. 4 % {{of the population}} of the Netherlands. HCV infection can lead to liver cirrhosis and liver cancer. In addition to the severe burden of disease, the failure to find and treat those infected at an early stage also leads to a considerable economic burden on society. Since treatment success rates have improved substantially in the past years, long term complications can now be largely prevented. Consequently, the need for finding and treating those infected with HCV is on the increase. This thesis aims to improve <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> by evaluating the effectiveness and the economic consequences of a variety of <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> strategies for hepatitis C. Chapter 1 provides an overview of why improvements in <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> of hepatitis C are important. Chapter 2 demonstrates that increased efforts in <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> strategies to reach the target population and medical professionals are worth the effort. Section 2. 1 shows that a public campaign aimed at increasing awareness and <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> of HCV in the general population can be effective, but only with a supplementary support programme for primary care. In Section 2. 2 we conclude that in a campaign aimed at HCV <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> among injecting and non-injecting hard drug users, pro-actively offering HCV consultation and testing by professionals in addiction care organisations is essential to attain effect. Chapter 3 illuminates the economic side of HCV <b>case</b> <b>finding.</b> Section 3. 1 demonstrates that if a <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> strategy is found to be clearly effective it is also likely to be cost-effective. For high-risk populations such as hard drug users the gain in effect is relatively high and costs of <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> can be kept low. In Section 3. 2 the current costs of HCV treatment in daily practice in the Netherlands, in relation to treatment outcome and side effects, are discussed. Although success rates have improved substantially in the past decades, the current costs of unsuccessful treatment and side effects are high. Section 3. 3 shows the effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of a nationwide hepatitis C campaign and its interventions in the Netherlands. The intervention aimed at hard drug users in addiction care was clearly effective and cost-effective. The intervention aimed at risk groups in the general population showed only a moderate effect, leading to considerable uncertainty about cost-effectiveness. This could in part be contributed to the unfavourable circumstances of its implementation. However, the overall number of HCV carriers identified by this large scale campaign remains moderate. Chapter 4 describes the effect of a new HCV <b>case</b> <b>finding</b> strategy in primary care practice. We demonstrate that routine testing for HCV in patients with an ALT elevation of 50 to 100 IU/L could theoretically lead to the identification of an estimated 1, 200 to 1, 300 chronic HCV carriers in the Netherlands alone. The final chapter describes the lessons learned from the thesis and the role of different health care professionals in the identification of hepatitis C...|$|R
