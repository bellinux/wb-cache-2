25|$|In 1988, Morrissey {{launched}} his solo career with Viva <b>Hate.</b> <b>This</b> album and its follow-ups—Bona Drag, Kill Uncle, Your Arsenal, and Vauxhall and I—all {{did well in}} the UK Albums Chart and spawned a number of hit singles. During this time his image began to shift into that of a burlier figure, who toyed with patriotic imagery and working-class masculinity. In the mid-to-late 1990s, his subsequent albums, Southpaw Grammar and Maladjusted, also charted but were less well received. Relocating to Los Angeles, he embarked on a hiatus between 1998 and 2003 before releasing a successful comeback album, You Are the Quarry, in 2004. Ensuing years saw the release of albums Ringleader of the Tormentors, Years of Refusal, and World Peace Is None of Your Business. He released his autobiography in 2013, followed by his first novel in 2015. His eleventh solo album, Low in High School, is set {{to be released in}} November 2017.|$|E
25|$|Brunk {{revealed}} in a shoot promo {{and in the}} documentary film Forever Hardcore that {{in fact it was}} not Paul Heyman that brought him into Extreme Championship Wrestling (ECW) but that he was at {{the right place at the}} right time. He was referred by a friend to Tod Gordon. According to the storyline, Sabu, who at that time often arrived to the ring by his handler 911, was an uncontrollable madman strapped to a gurney and with a Hannibal Lecter-style face mask while trying to break free (he claimed to <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> part of his gimmick as he was normally tired before he started his match). Sabu could only be released from his bonds to wrestle his matches. Sabu also quickly became synonymous with table-breaking at this time; if a table was not broken during the match, Sabu would break a table with his own body after the bell had sounded, sometimes leading to 911 having to restrain Sabu during backstage interviews if a table was present.|$|E

Ian eventually forgives Michelle but Martin still refuses to speak to her. Michelle attempts to find work in schools, without any luck. Stacey invites Michelle to a family meal but Martin says Michelle is only pretending to care about her family, and tells her that she is not the big sister he used to look up to.

Eventually, Martin and Michelle start to talk again but he is still angry that she has behaved like a teenager.

Lewis speculates that Applewhite settled on suicide because he had said that the group would ascend during his lifetime and thus appointing a successor was unfeasible.|$|E
500|$|Streep's {{first feature}} film role came {{opposite}} Jane Fonda in the 1977 film Julia, {{in which she}} had a small role during a flashback sequence. Most of her scenes were edited out, but the brief time on screen horrified the actress: [...] "I had a bad wig and they took the words from the scene I shot with Jane and put them in my mouth in a different scene. I thought, I've made a terrible mistake, no more movies. I <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> business".

Lloyd George wrote that [...] "What {{he says in}} one of his letters, 'I <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> game, but it is the only thing one must do just now', represents, I believe, the conviction of those vast armies who, realising what is at stake, have risked all and endured all that liberty may be saved". Haig spoke of Ball's [...] "unrivalled courage" [...] and his [...] "example and incentive to those who have taken up his work".

500|$|Many [...] {{students}} and alumni wear a large, heavy, distinctive class ring {{known as the}} [...] "Brass Rat". Originally created in 1929, the ring's official name is the [...] "Standard Technology Ring." [...] The undergraduate ring design (a separate graduate student version exists as well) varies slightly {{from year to year}} to reflect the unique character of the MIT experience for that class, but always features a three-piece design, with the MIT seal and the class year each appearing on a separate face, flanking a large rectangular bezel bearing an image of a beaver. The initialism IHTFP, representing the informal school motto [...] "I <b>Hate</b> <b>This</b> Fucking Place" [...] and jocularly euphemized as [...] "I Have Truly Found Paradise," [...] "Institute Has The Finest Professors," [...] "It's Hard to Fondle Penguins," [...] and other variations, has occasionally been featured on the ring given its historical prominence in student culture.|$|E

Morgan found the role a challenge, explaining, [...] "For some reason, in reading the novel, you don't <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> guy even though he does things that are unmentionable.

500|$|After {{a three-year}} hiatus in hopes to further Scherzinger's own solo career, the group reunited {{to record their}} second and final studio album, Doll Domination in September 2008. Scherzinger began to receive a larger input in the {{recording}} process as co-writer and co-producer of the album. Doll Domination garnered a higher peak position than PCD of number four on Billboard 200, but failed to match its predecessor's commercial success. Its lead single [...] "When I Grow Up" [...] became another top ten single for the group. [...] "I <b>Hate</b> <b>This</b> Part" [...] was released as the second single and managed to attain similar success. In early 2009, Doll Domination was re-released as two compilation albums. The lead single from Doll Domination 2.0 was [...] "Jai Ho!

500|$|Steve Kloves was {{selected}} to write the screenplay. He described adapting the book as [...] "tough", as it did not [...] "lend itself to adaptation {{as well as the}} next two books." [...] Kloves often received synopses of books proposed as film adaptations from Warner Bros., which he [...] "almost never read", but Harry Potter jumped out at him. He went out and bought the book, and became an instant fan of the series. When speaking to Warner Bros., he stated that the film had to be British, and had to be true to the characters. Kloves was nervous when he first met Rowling as he did not want her to think he was going to [...] " [...] her baby." [...] Rowling admitted that she [...] "was really ready to <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> Steve Kloves," [...] but recalled her initial meeting with him: [...] "The first time I met him, he said to me, 'You know who my favourite character is?' And I thought, You're gonna say Ron. I know you're gonna say Ron. But he said 'Hermione.' And I just kind of melted." [...] Rowling received a large amount of creative control, an arrangement that Columbus did not mind.|$|E
500|$|Morrissey {{deliberately}} used archaic language when composing the voice-over style lyrics for [...] "This Charming Man". His use of {{phrases and}} {{words such as}} 'hillside desolate', 'stitch to wear', 'handsome' and 'charming' are used to convey a more courtly world than the mid-Eighties north of England, and evoke a style that has, {{in the words of}} the music critic Mat Snow [...] "nothing to do with fashion". Morrissey had already used the word 'handsome' in a song title—in [...] "Handsome Devil", the B-side to [...] "Hand in Glove"—and observed in a 1983 interview with Barney Hoskyns that he used the word to [...] "try and revive some involvement with language people no longer use. In the daily scheme of things, people's language is so frighteningly limited, and if you use a word with more than 10 letters it's absolute snobbery." [...] Snow puts forward the case that through the use of the dated word 'charming', Morrissey sought to rebel against the then mainstream gay culture from which he felt alienated. Morrissey told Hoskyns: [...] "I <b>hate</b> <b>this</b> 'festive faggot' thing ... People listen to [...] "This Charming Man" [...] and think no further than what anyone would presume. I hate that angle, and it's surprising that the gay press have harped on more than anyone else. I hate it when people talk to me about sex in a trivial way." ...|$|E
