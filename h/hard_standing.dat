5|$|In 1989 {{the club}} {{moved to the}} Portway Stadium, {{situated}} in the Portway Industrial Estate on the western outskirts of the town. Built {{at a cost of}} £850,000, the ground has a main stand of brick and concrete construction with bench seating for around 250 people. This stand is set on a bank running along the entire south side of the ground, giving spectators on that side an elevated view of the pitch. The managers' benches are set into this banking in front of the stand at pitch level. The banking slopes down behind each goal until it reaches the same level as the pitch along the north side. There is <b>hard</b> <b>standing</b> around the entire perimeter of pitch, along with a turnstile block and a gate opening out onto the stadium car park for ambulance access.|$|E
25|$|On 17 September 1947 hangar 7 was leased to Trans Australian Airlines as a cargo {{handling}} warehouse. On 21 October 1947 the insurance valuation of the igloo hangar with 24ft of <b>hard</b> <b>standing</b> either side and 60ft onto the apron {{was estimated to}} be £3700.|$|E
60|$|He forgot what he {{owed the}} Shasta Company and what Anthea Merril {{had said to}} him, for the {{primitive}} man had come uppermost under the stress of conflict. Twining {{his hands in the}} whistle-lanyard, he hurled out a great blast that the rocks flung back through the turmoil of the tide, and then once more gripped the bridge rails <b>hard,</b> <b>standing</b> rigidly still, with grim wet face and a light in his eyes. For two more minutes the issue hung in the balance, and then, while a wider gap of water opened up ahead, the Adelaide swung back astern. In a few moments there was a hoarse, exultant clamor from both vessels, and the froth-swept rock slid away behind her. In front lay a stretch of less troubled water. Half an hour later the Shasta came around again in a big sweep, and when the anchors went down the two vessels lay rolling uneasily in comparative shelter.|$|E
40|$|Ammonia {{emissions}} from agriculture are {{a cause for}} environmental concern contributing 226 kt NH 3 -N per year to the atmosphere. Emissions from outdoor concrete yards or <b>hard</b> <b>standings</b> represent a pre-viously ignored but potentially significant source of ammonia. To increase the robustness of estimates of ammonia emission from <b>hard</b> <b>standings,</b> measurements were made on 13 commercial farms (dairy, beef and sheep). Dairy farms {{were found to be}} the most significant source, in particular, feeding/loafing yards emitting 462 mg NH 3 -N m- 2 hr- 1. During the winter of 2002 an experiment was carried out to assess poten-tial ammonia abatement measures that may be used on <b>hard</b> <b>standings.</b> Of the four abatement measures tes-ted daily scraping and pressure washing proved to be most effective at reducing ammonia emission. These results together with those a repeat experiment during summer 2003 and testing of selected abatement mea-sures on commercial farms will serve to provide more concrete evidence on how to reduce ammonia emis-sions from <b>hard</b> <b>standings...</b>|$|R
2500|$|The current {{combined}} {{camp and}} training area covers [...] of wooded areas, heath, wetlands and <b>hard</b> <b>standings.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{airfield}} had one B1 and two T2 hangars and 36 aircraft <b>hard</b> <b>standings</b> {{and there}} was accommodation for 1,531 males and 251 females of all ranks.|$|R
6000|$|... "Elbe sweeps freely {{through this}} Country, for ages and aeons past; curling himself a little into snake-figure, and with {{increased}} velocity, but silent mostly, and trim to the edge, a fine flint-colored river;--though in aeons long anterior, {{it must have}} been a very different matter for torrents and water-power. The Country is one huge Block of Sandstone, so many square miles of that material; ribbed, channelled, torn and quarried, in this manner, by the ever-busy elements, for a million of Ages past! Chiefly by the Elbe himself, since he got to be a River, and became cosmic and personal; ceasing to be a mere watery chaos of Lakes and Deluges hereabouts. For the Sandstone was of various degrees of hardness; tenacious as marble some parts of it, soft almost as sand other parts. And the primordial diluviums and world-old torrents, great and small, rushing down from the Bohemian Highlands, from the Saxon Metal Mountains, with such storming, gurgling and swashing, have swept away the soft parts, and left the <b>hard</b> <b>standing</b> in this chaotic manner, and bequeathed it all to the Elbe, and the common frosts and rains of these human ages.|$|E
50|$|The West Stand - Currently the West Side is <b>hard</b> <b>standing</b> for 586 spectators. Plans {{to convert}} the stand into a 400-seat covered end with {{changing}} rooms for the Juniors and an all-weather pitch await finance as of January 2009. The changing rooms have been completed and the next phase will be to cover and seat the <b>hard</b> <b>standing</b> area.|$|E

2500|$|In World War II, {{aircraft}} dispersal and work areas with <b>hard</b> <b>standings</b> were built outside the old airfield area: north of Yewtree Lane by Fairey's area, and southeast of Altrincham Road (Styal) {{by the three}} southeast hangars. These were linked to by [...] "level crossings" [...] across those two roads, which were {{closed to the public}} except to those with a local resident's pass from early 1940 to mid 1945. After the war these <b>hard</b> <b>standings</b> were removed and the land was returned to farming, and the two roads became public again.|$|R
50|$|The move to RAF Watton did {{not prove}} to be fortuitous. The heavy B-24s were {{incompatible}} with the grass runways and muddy <b>hard</b> <b>standings</b> there and were forced {{to move back to}} Alconbury in January 1944.|$|R
50|$|Today {{the site}} has reverted to {{agriculture}} although several wartime buildings remain and are used for storage. Parts of the <b>hard</b> <b>standings</b> also survive and are used for a car boot sale every Sunday between March and November.|$|R
50|$|In 2004, {{following}} {{promotion to}} the Isthmian League, the old wooden stand was knocked {{down and a}} new 352-seat grandstand {{was built on the}} halfway line, stretching for just under a third of the pitch. Behind the motorway end <b>hard</b> <b>standing</b> was <b>hard</b> <b>standing</b> with a cover, this was named the Silverlake Stand. In 2006, the roof was widened across the Silverlake Stand to cover the whole width of the pitch.|$|E

60|$|The wheels spun, {{splintering}} the timber, rising a {{few inches}} and sinking again, while the big machine shook and tilted in danger of falling over. <b>Harding,</b> <b>standing</b> on the slippery plates, opened the throttle wide, {{and after a while}} the front rose to a threatening height while the logs groaned and cracked.|$|R
50|$|Once established, the Romans {{worked to}} develop {{infrastructure}} in Lincolnshire. They built the Car Dyke, {{a series of}} semi-natural and artificial boundary ditches which run from the River Welland at Market Deeping for 64 km to the River Witham at Washingborough, constructed <b>hard</b> <b>standings</b> and walkways across the Fens, and also built inland ports, such as the Brayford Pool at Lincoln.|$|R
50|$|Planning {{permission}} {{was granted}} in 2003 for further {{work to be}} done to the ground and in 2004 <b>hard</b> <b>standing,</b> a grandstand, new dugouts and floodlights were all erected and working in just three months.|$|E
5000|$|Much of {{the rest}} of the ground is undeveloped <b>hard</b> <b>standing.</b> Nearest to the {{turnstiles}} on the northeast side of the ground, there is a toilet block and sometimes a second hot food stall, depending on segregation requirements and demand. Opposite the main stand there is a single step of terracing that straddles the halfway line of the pitch. Further along this side, in the opposite direction from the T&C Cars Stand, is a smaller area of covered seating that was erected in 2016. The furthest end of the ground from the turnstiles is all <b>hard</b> <b>standing,</b> and is known as [...] "The DrainTech End" [...] for sponsorship reasons.|$|E
50|$|Barlows Park {{was built}} on an old {{landfill}} site and was opened in 2007. The ground has pitch fencing, <b>hard</b> <b>standing</b> and flood lights. It is managed by the Barlow's Park Management Association and {{is also home to}} Reading F.C. Women.|$|E
50|$|Private {{ownership}} has {{damaged the}} integrity of the overall design, with <b>hard</b> <b>standings</b> replacing some gardens and renovations to the cladding and the windows breaking up the previous unity of the design, the area was made into a Conservation Area in 1978, to protect it by removing PD rights, and a management strategy put in place to encourage owners to reinstate original features.|$|R
60|$|Hester {{smiled at}} him proudly, and he turned and started off at top speed down the trail. They all followed, and, {{crossing}} the bridge, found <b>Harding</b> <b>standing</b> by his blowing team. The horses' coats were foul with sweat, and Harding's face was badly scratched, {{but he did not}} seem to know it, and except that he was breathless he looked much as usual.|$|R
50|$|Further {{development}} of the airfield commenced in September 1939, when work was started on laying two concrete runways. In addition to the laying of the runways, the airfield was expanded to the south, east and west by taking in adjoining fields. The new 2800 ft long runway was laid north-east to south-west, with another of similar length on a north-south heading. A new perimeter track was laid around the airfield boundary with eight dispersal pens, each capable of taking a twin-engined aircraft. Also along the track were thirty four <b>hard</b> <b>standings</b> for single-engined fighters, and nine slightly larger <b>hard</b> <b>standings.</b> Three of the old pre-war Callendar hangars were dismantled, leaving just the Lamella and one Callendar hangar opposite the main gate. Many additional buildings were constructed between the airfield and the road. An Operations room for the stations new role was built near the Lamella hangar. This Operations room was later supplemented by an underground Battle Headquarters near the Cow Stand Farm corner of the airfield.|$|R
50|$|The clubhouse, {{pitches and}} car park and other {{original}} facilities were constructed {{at a cost}} of £450,000, and further improvements were carried out in 2000, including the addition of perimeter railings and <b>hard</b> <b>standing</b> on the dugout side of the pitch.|$|E
50|$|Until 2006, {{the area}} {{opposite}} the grandstand was just <b>hard</b> <b>standing</b> backing into tall fir trees. During {{the summer of}} 2006, a metal back and roof were added, along with an electronic scoreboard {{on the roof of}} the Premier Telecom stand.|$|E
5000|$|Sholing {{play their}} home {{games at the}} Universal Stadium, Portsmouth Road, Southampton, Hampshire, SO19 9PW. The ground has covered seating for 150 {{supporters}} and a covered terrace for another 100. There is <b>hard</b> <b>standing</b> around {{the length of the}} pitch.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} commenced {{training at}} Castlereagh in July. During this month 73.35 {{hours of flight}} training were conducted in Mosquito aircraft and No. 9 Airfield Construction Squadron built <b>hard</b> <b>standings</b> to protect the aircraft from waterlogged ground. Representatives from Rolls Royce and de Havilland's propeller division also lectured No. 94 Squadron's ground and air crew. Delivery of the squadron's Mosquitos was slow, however, and this greatly hampered its training program.|$|R
50|$|The former {{airfield}} is {{the site}} of the former Royal Air Force Station Morpeth or simply RAF Morpeth which was an air gunnery school and was home to No. 80 (French) Operational Training Unit RAF.
