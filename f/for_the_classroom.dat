500|$|Douglas filmed {{the opening}} scene, which is Gekko being {{released}} from Sing Sing maximum-security prison, in Ossining, Westchester County, on September 18. Stone felt that the prison scene was a [...] "key plot element" [...] {{because there is no}} one there to meet Gekko, who returns to society as an outsider. Regarding there being no scenes that show Gekko adjusting to the modern world, the director clarified that there is [...] "very little space to do those kind of tricks in this movie" [...] because of how modern the world is becoming on a monthly basis. Filming took place in Fordham University <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> scenes on October 10 and 11. In order to shoot a dining scene between LaBeouf and Douglas, Shun Lee West closed for 24 hours so the two could film scenes at the restaurant for the entire day of November 10.

500|$|To Kill a Mockingbird {{has been}} a source of {{significant}} controversy since its being the subject of classroom study as early as 1963. The book's racial slurs, profanity, and frank discussion of rape have led people to challenge its appropriateness in libraries and classrooms across the United States. The American Library Association reported that To Kill a Mockingbird was number 21 of the 100 most frequently challenged books of 2000–2009. Following parental complaints about the racist language it contains, the novel was removed from classrooms in Virginia in 2016 and Biloxi in 2017, where it was described as making people [...] "uncomfortable." [...] In the Mississippi case, the novel was removed from the required reading list but subsequently made available to interested students with parental consent. Such decisions have been criticised: the American Civil Liberties Union noted the importance of engaging with the novel's themes in places where racial injustice persists. Becky Little of The History Channel and representatives of the Mark Twain House pointed out the value of classics lies in their power to [...] "challenge the way we think about things" [...] (Twain's Adventures of Huckleberry Finn has attracted similar controversy). Arne Duncan, who served as Secretary of Education under President Obama, noted that removal of the book from reading lists was evidence of a nation with [...] "real problems." [...] In 1966, a parent in Hanover, Virginia protested that the use of rape as a plot device was immoral. Johnson cites examples of letters to local newspapers, which ranged from amusement to fury; those letters expressing the most outrage, however, complained about Mayella Ewell's attraction to Tom Robinson over the depictions of rape. Upon learning the school administrators were holding hearings to decide the book's appropriateness <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom,</b> Harper Lee sent $10 to The Richmond News Leader suggesting it to be used toward the enrollment of [...] "the Hanover County School Board in any first grade of its choice". The National Education Association in 1968 placed the novel second on a list of books receiving the most complaints from private organizations—after Little Black Sambo.|$|E

2500|$|According to Dewey, this {{propensity}} {{and passion}} for intellectual {{growth in the}} profession {{must be accompanied by}} a natural desire to communicate one’s knowledge with others. [...] “There are scholars who have [...] in a marked degree but who lack enthusiasm for imparting it. [...] To the ‘natural born’ teacher learning is incomplete unless it is shared” (Dewey, APT, 2010, p.35). [...] For Dewey, it is not enough <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> teacher to be a lifelong learner of the techniques and subject-matter of education; she must aspire to share what she knows with others in her learning community.|$|E

2500|$|In 1987, SCS and Seckel helped sponsor an amicus brief {{before the}} U.S. Supreme Court {{in the case}} Edwards v.

The brief was written {{by a group of}} attorneys led by Jeffrey Lehman (later president of Cornell University), and SCS board member and Nobel Laureate Murray Gell-Mann recruited the signatures of 72 Nobel Laureates, 17 State Academies of Science, and 7 other scientific organizations. It argued that [...] "creation science" [...] was counter not only to the study of evolution, but to all sciences. The court decided in a 7-2 vote that so-called [...] "creation-science" [...] was in fact, religion disguised as science, deliberately construed as such in order to circumvent the constitutional prohibitions of keeping Church and State separate, especially in the public science classroom. All of the opinions cited the brief, including the dissents.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are many}} uses for {{podcasting}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom.</b> They {{can be used}} to convey instructional information from the teacher or trainer, motivational stories, and auditory case studies. [...] Podcasts can also be used by the learners as artifacts and evidence of learning; for example, a student might prepare a brief podcast as a summary of a concept in lieu of writing an essay. [...] Podcasts can also be used as a means of self-reflection on the learning processes or products. Podcasts can help keep students on the same page, including those that are absent! Absent students can use your podcasts to see class lectures, daily activities, homework assignments, handouts, and more. A review of literature that reports the use of audio podcasts in K-12 and higher education found that individuals (1) use existing podcasts and/or (2) create their own podcasts. Students can create their own podcast to share their learning experiences with each other and also with other students from other schools.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{correlational}} study, Katz and Shahar used {{a series}} of questionnaires and Likert-style scales and gave them to 100 teachers to see what makes a motivating teacher. Their results indicate that teachers who are intrinsically motivated to teach and believe that students should be taught in an autonomous style are the types of teachers that promote intrinsic motivation in the classroom [...] Deci, Sheinman, and Nezlek also found that when teachers adapted to an autonomous teaching style, students were positively affected and became more intrinsically motivated to achieve in the classroom. [...] However, while the students were quick {{to adapt to the}} new teaching style the impact was short-lived [...] Thus, teachers are limited in the way they teach because they’ll feel a pressure to act, teach, and provide feedback in a certain way from the school district, administration, and guardians , [...] Furthermore, even if students do have a teacher that promotes an autonomous teaching style, their overall school environment is also a factor because it can be extrinsically motivating. Examples of this would be posters around school promoting pizza parties for highest grade point average or longer recess times <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> that brings more canned food donations.|$|E
30|$|Finally, in step four, we {{constructed}} distractor plots separately <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>classrooms</b> between {{which we}} observed {{significant differences in}} item difficulty.

50|$|As {{with the}} primary school, the big {{overhanging}} tin roof protects the clay walls from sun and rain.

Therefore, the primary school extension uses a rounded vault roof, which needs fewer steel supports.|$|R
