500|$|Series {{producer}} Ryan Murphy first planned {{an episode}} entitled [...] "Original Song" [...] to air in early 2010, during the series' first season. Prior to this episode, most of Glees musical performances were cover versions, and by October 2009 {{he had received}} offers from multiple songwriters willing to devise original tracks. At the time, he stated that Diane Warren would write two ballads for the show, and if successful, Glee may continue to use original music in the future, {{but not all the}} time. These plans did not come to fruition, nor did a December 2009 claim by OneRepublic frontman Ryan Tedder that he had been recruited by Glees music supervisor, Adam Anders, to write an original song for the series. Murphy later stated that he planned to showcase original music during the second season, aiming to find a way for this to occur organically, as: [...] "It wouldn’t work [...] if they just broke out and started singing their own songs.

2500|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, Stephen Sondheim {{outlined}} a musical stage adaptation and {{went so far}} as to compose the first scene with librettist Burt Shevelove. A chance encounter with Billy Wilder at a cocktail party gave Sondheim the opportunity to introduce himself and ask the original film's co-screenwriter and director his opinion of the project (which was to star Jeanette MacDonald). [...] "You can't write a musical about Sunset Boulevard," [...] Wilder responded, [...] "it <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> opera. After all, it's about a dethroned queen". Sondheim immediately aborted his plans. A few years later, when he was invited by Hal Prince to write the score for a film remake starring Angela Lansbury as a fading musical comedian rather than a silent film star, Sondheim declined, citing his conversation with Wilder.|$|E

[...] A few days later Iranian supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei rejected the offer and added ambiguously: [...] "The U.S. policies in the Middle East have failed and the Americans are in need of a winning hand. That is bringing Iran to the negotiating table." [...] On 4 February the Italian news-wire [...] "Agenzia Nova", citing [...] "sources in Teheran," [...] reported that [...] "from {{the beginning of the year}} Ali Larijani, Speaker of the (Iranian) Parliament, secretly traveled twice to the United States" [...] to launch direct negotiations with the Obama Administration.

It was reported on 17 June Iran’s newly elected president Hassan Rohani had expressed readiness for bilateral talks with Washington, with conditions.|$|E

After the ADE 651 {{became the}} focus of controversy for its role in Iraq, concerns were raised in Pakistan about its employment as a bomb detector by the ASF. A senior official at Jinnah International Airport denied that the ADE 651 was being used, claiming that the ASF had designed the device in use there, but other ASF officials acknowledged that their device [...] "operated on the same principle as ADE-651." [...] Sources claim that Device similar to ADE is made in Pakistan and is in use by Pakistan army. Source also found that these devices are working and have helped in catching 46 guns in different locations at different times. Source also visited an army checkpost on Kohat Highway with a 9mm pistol which was successfully detected by Army Personal. On the other hand, Pakistani scientists rejected the scientific basis on which the device was claimed to work; Professor Shahid Zaidi of Karachi University told the Pakistani newspaper Dawn that [...] "there <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>an</b> electric, magnetic or electromagnetic field for a device to work in such a manner. Furthermore static fields don’t move around the way it is being claimed by some. Also don’t forget {{that there are so many}} radio waves of different frequencies all around us. I just don’t see how this device would work." [...] Dawn challenged the ASF to test the device to confirm its effectiveness but the ASF refused, insisting that the device works.|$|E

Nandi is a {{favorite}} of Shiva, as he is Shiva's vehicle. Although Shiva lost the game, Nandi declared him the winner. It is stated that Parvati was indignant over Nandi's partiality for Shiva and cursed him that he should die from an incurable disease. Thereupon Nandi fell at the feet of Parvati and pleaded for forgiveness. [...] "Mother forgive me. Should I not show at least this amount of gratitude to one who is my master? Is it not humiliating for me to declare that my master has lost the game? To uphold his honor I no doubt uttered a lie. But am I to be punished with such severity for so small an offence?", Nandi prayed for forgiveness in this manner. Parvati forgave Nandi and taught him the means to atone for his lapse. She told him, [...] "The Chaturdasi day in the month of Purattaasi; Tamil: September - October (Bhadrapada; Sanskrit: August - September) is the day when my son's birthday is celebrated. On that day you must to offer to my son what pleases you the most". [...] For Nandi the most enjoyable and relishing food is green grass. As directed by Parvati Nandi worshipped Ganapathi by offering green grass. Nandi was then relieved of his dreaded disease. His health improved and by the grace of Parvati he was redeemed.|$|E

And many of the phenomena which moderns hastily condemn are really parts of this position of the woman as the center and pillar of health.
