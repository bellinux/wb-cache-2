25|$|In {{addition}} to ethanol and water, most alcoholic drinks also contain congeners, either as flavoring or as {{a by-product of}} fermentation and the wine aging process. While ethanol is by itself sufficient to produce most hangover effects, congeners may potentially aggravate hangover and other residual effects to some extent. Congeners include substances such as amines, amides, acetones, acetaldehydes, polyphenols, methanol, histamines, <b>fusel</b> <b>oil,</b> esters, furfural, and tannins, many {{but not all of}} which are toxic. One study in mice indicates that <b>fusel</b> <b>oil</b> may have a mitigating effect on hangover symptoms, while some whiskey congeners such as butanol protect the stomach against gastric mucosal damage in the rat. Different types of alcoholic beverages contain different amounts of congeners. In general, dark liquors have a higher concentration while clear liquors have a lower concentration. Whereas vodka has virtually no more congeners than pure ethanol, bourbon has a total congener content 37 times higher than that found in vodka.|$|E

2500|$|The {{flavouring}} of whisky {{is partially}} {{determined by the}} presence of congeners and <b>fusel</b> <b>oils.</b> <b>Fusel</b> <b>oils</b> are higher alcohols than ethanol, are mildly toxic, and have a strong, disagreeable smell and taste. An excess of <b>fusel</b> <b>oils</b> in whisky is considered a defect. A variety of methods are employed in the distillation process to remove unwanted <b>fusel</b> <b>oils.</b> [...] Traditionally, American distillers focused on secondary filtration using charcoal, gravel, sand, or linen to remove undesired distillates.|$|R

High content of isoamyl alcohol (390 g. L- 1), isobutyl alcohol (158 g. L- 1), ethyl alcohol (28, 4 g. L- 1), methyl alcohol (16, 6 g. L- 1) and n-propyl alcohol (11, 9 g. L- 1) were found.

The volatile compounds were analysed by GC–MS method, and the sensory quality was evaluated by panelist. The results indicated that ultrasonic treatment of the steeped greengage wine at 45 kHz 360 Wfor 30 min was effective to accelerate the aging process, where the <b>fusel</b> <b>oils</b> and alcohol compounds were significantly reduced and acid and ester compounds were significantly increased...|$|R

[...] The goal of distillation is to capture the aromatics while removing nearly all <b>fusel</b> <b>oil.</b> [...] The resulting profile must be just right because barrel aging or blending cannot be used to alter it. [...] Distilled liquor is held for precisely 6 months in clean neutral vessels before bottling so as to allow the aroma profile to intensify.|$|E

50|$|The {{maturation}} process causes {{four main}} chemical transformations to the tequila compounds: (1) decreasing of <b>fusel</b> <b>oils</b> by the char in barrels, which {{acts as an}} adsorbing agent. (2) extraction of complex wood constituents by tequila, yielding specific aroma and flavor to the final product. (3) reactions among the components of tequila, creating new chemical compounds and (4) oxidation of the original contents of tequila and of those extracted from wood.

After a raising of the alarm, 500 men of the 15th, the King's hussars (a cavalry regiment), along with fire engines and other constabulary rushed to the scene, preventing the fire from spreading further. At the time, the bonded storehouses contained 400,000 gallons of whiskey. It was estimated that the fire caused £10,000 of damages and 100 redundancies.

5000|$|In the German Democratic Republic, the lye {{produced}} from the wood pulp was {{employed in the}} production of the Holzschnaps ("wood schnapps").

Production of isoamyl and isobutyl alcohols begins after the sugar level is lowered substantially and continues {{for several hours}} after the alcoholic fermentation ends. In contrast, ethanol production begins in the first hours of the fermentation and ends with logarithmic yeast growth. The alcohol content in tequila is affected by three factors. First the amount of isoamyl alcohol and isobutanol is the yeast strain. Second, the carbon:nitrogen ratio. The higher the ratio, the more alcohol produced. And third, the temperature of fermentation.|$|E

2500|$|A common folk {{test for}} the quality of moonshine was to pour a small {{quantity}} of it into a spoon and set it on fire.

This led to the mnemonic, [...] "Lead burns red and makes you dead." [...] or [...] "Red means dead."
