5|$|Bulgaria has a {{universal}} healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions. The National <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Fund</b> (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 percent of GDP. The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by average life expectancy, which stands at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and respiratory diseases.|$|E
25|$|Like all {{insurance}} schemes, {{different types}} of premiums are available under the country's NHIS. Ghanaian contributors are grouped according to their levels of income. Based on the group a Ghanaian contributor may fall in, there is specific premium {{that ought to be}} paid. This was done since the socio-economic condition scheme contributors is not the same and the Ghanaian contributions was to be affordable for all to ensure that nobody is forced to remain in cash and carry system. This meant that Ghanaian contributions payable could vary from one district to the other as even the disease burden was also not the same in all the districts. To ensure that all Ghanaian citizens made some contribution to the scheme, a 2.5% Health Insurance Levy on selected goods and services was passed into law so that the money collected could be put into a National <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance</b> <b>Fund</b> to subsidize fully paid contributions to the District Health Insurance Schemes.|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{question}} posed {{in this article}} is whether single-payer health care systems are more likely to provide equal treatment for equal need (horizontal equity) than are multipayer systems. To address this question, we compare access to primary and specialty health care services across selected neighborhoods, grouped by aver-age household income, in a single-payer system (the English NHS), a multiple-payer system with universal coverage (French National <b>Health</b> <b>Insurance),</b> and the U. S. multiple-payer system characterized by large gaps in <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> coverage. We find that Paris residents, including those with low incomes, have better access to health care than their counterparts in Inner London and Manhattan. This finding casts doubt on the notion that the number of payers influences the capacity of a health care system to provide equitable access to its residents. The lesson is to worry less about the number of payers and more about the system’s ability to assure access to primary and specialty care services. Equity in Three Contrasting Health Systems The U. S. health care system presents a stark contrast to France and England, both of which provide universal health care coverage, albeit in different ways. France is an example of statutory national <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> (NHI) systems that rely on significant mandatory payroll taxation, much like Social Security in the United States. It has multiple <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds,</b> but unlike the multipayer system in the United States, French <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> all operate within a common framework in which no one is permitted to opt out of the system, <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> are no...|$|R
40|$|There are fragmentations in Iran’s <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> system. Multiple <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> exist, without {{adequate}} provisions for transfer or redistribution of cross subsidy among them. Multiple risk pools, including several private secondary insurance schemes, {{have resulted in}} a tiered <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> system with inequitable benefit packages for different segments of the population. Also fragmentation might have contributed to inefficiency in the <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> systems, a low financial protection against healthcare expenditures for the insured persons, high coinsurance rates, a notable rate of insurance coverage duplication, low contribution of well-funded institutes with generous benefit package to the public <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> schemes, underfunding and severe financial shortages for the public funds, and a lack of transparency and reliable data and statistics for policy-making. We have conducted a policy analysis study, including qualitative interviews of key informants and document analysis. As a result we introduce three policy options: keeping the existing structural fragmentations of social <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> (SHI) schemes but implementing a comprehensive “policy integration” strategy; consolidation of existing <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> and creating a single national <b>health</b> <b>insurance</b> scheme; and reducing fragmentation by merging minor well-resourced funds together and creating two or three large <b>insurance</b> <b>funds</b> under the umbrella of the existing organizations.
