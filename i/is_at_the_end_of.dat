Californium-253 <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a production chain that starts with uranium-238, includes several isotopes of plutonium, americium, curium, berkelium, and the californium isotopes 249 to 253 (see diagram).|$|E
5|$|The village hall <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> Church Lane, {{opposite}} The Rectory {{which is}} believed to have been built in 1529 by the rector, Sir John Barry, (Rector 1524–46). It has undergone substantial renovations including the addition of a clock tower for the Rev. W. P. Wait, which has since been removed and further alterations in about 1876 for Rev. J. Ellershaw. The building has an ornate south front with carvings of shields bearing the coat of arms of the St Loe family, who were once chief landowners in the area, alone or impaled with arms of Fitzpane, Ancell, de la Rivere and Malet. It is Grade II* listed. In 1945 it started to be used again as the rectory, for the parish. The parish is within the Benefice of Chew Stoke with Nempnett Thrubwell and forms part of the Diocese of Bath and Wells. The rectory was sold by the church in 2008 and is now a private dwelling.|$|E

5|$|Wear of the {{insignia}} is {{according to}} guidelines {{issued by the}} Chancellery of Honours, which stipulate that the badges be worn before most other national orders—that <b>is,</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> an individual's medal bar closest to {{the centre of the}} chest or at the wearer's neck—with only the Victoria Cross, the Cross of Valour, and the badge of the Order of Merit permitted to be worn before the badges of the Order of Canada. Those in the grades of Companion or Officer may wear their badges on a neck ribbon, while those in the Member group display their insignia suspended by a ribbon from a medal bar on the left chest. Protocol originally followed the British tradition, wherein female appointees wore their Order of Canada emblem on a ribbon bow positioned on the left shoulder. These regulations were altered in 1997, and women may wear their insignia in either the traditional manner or in the same fashion as the men.|$|E
5|$|The {{southern}} side of {{the church}} has nine bays, again divided by buttresses. In the third bay from the west is a porch. The other bays each contain a two-light window with trefoil heads. The porch is in two storeys, with angle buttresses and a battlemented parapet with gargoyles. The lower storey contains a doorway with a pointed arch, and the upper storey has a two-light window. The doorway and window are set slightly {{to the west of}} the centre, as the east wall contains a stairway. Inside the porch are stone seats and the remains of two stoups (holy water fonts). The staircase leading to the upper storey is composed of old gravestones. On the outer wall of the upper storey is a sundial. The west end of the church is in Perpendicular style, and has five bays. At its centre is another porch, this one with three storeys. At the west front are diagonal buttresses, and in the bottom storey is a double doorway, over which is a canopied niche containing the weathered image of a saint. In the middle storey is a three-light window, in the top storey a two-light window, and at the summit is a battlemented parapet. There are windows in the north and south faces of the top stage, and on the north side is an octagonal stair turret. Inside the porch are four corbels (supporting brackets) carved with musicians. On each {{side of the}} porch is a four-light window. At the west end of the north aisle is a four-light window, and a five-light window <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the south aisle.|$|E

25|$|In Nobiin, every {{utterance}} {{ends in a}} low tone. This is one of {{the clearest}} signs of the occurrence of a boundary tone, realized as a low tone on the last syllable of any prepausal word. The examples below show how the surface tone of the high tone verb ókkír- ‘cook’ depends on the position of the verb. In the first sentence, the verb is not final (because the question marker –náà is appended) and thus it is realized as high. In the second sentence, the verb <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the utterance, resulting in a low tone on the last syllable.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many schemes to link between Bradford's railway terminals. The major {{redevelopment}} of the city centre in the 1960s provided an opportunity to connect the termini but was not pursued and large buildings were constructed on the alignment in the 1990s. The main difficulty in connecting the termini is the great difference in elevation: Bradford Interchange <b>is</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a long slope, steep by railway standards, but is many feet higher than Forster Square. This gradient is not unprecedented in railway construction and the relocation of Forster Square Station further from the city centre has provided additional space in which the transition could be accomplished.|$|E
