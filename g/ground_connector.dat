5000|$|Semko 17 were 3/4-pin 3-phase connectors, with (4-pin) {{or without}} (3-pin) a neutral connector. Earth were {{provided}} via the shield. The connectors {{were available in}} different sizes, 16 A with rounded corners; 25 A and 63 A were rectangular. These connectors were used mainly in industrial and agricultural installations. Manufacturing and selling of Semko-17 connectors with metal shells was prohibited in 1989. A few years later manufacturing and selling of all Semko-17 connectors were prohibited. Existing connectors may be used but not by any employee (prohibited by [...] "Arbetsmilj√∂verket"). The reason for the prohibition is that Semko-17 had several safety issues. The ground connection can become oxidized and when the shells are made of metal any ground fault goes right through {{the hands of a}} person connecting/disconnecting a male and a female cable connector (unless the person wears insulating gloves). Incorrect use of the <b>ground</b> <b>connector</b> as a neutral was not uncommon. Perhaps the worst issue is that in some connectors the ground screw could rust so severely that the ground wire comes loose and in the worst case make contact with a line (phase) wire nearby.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Line {{to ground}} faults by {{deterioration}} of insulators has frequently occurred in power system, {{and the main}} cause is surface contamination of the insulators. The contamination of insulator is analyzed by monitoring the surface leakage current flowing them. The suspension insulator is monitored by installation of a zero-phase current sensor(ZCT), but the line-post insulator is impossible to apply the same method because of its large diameter structure. This paper proposed a detection method of surface leakage current for a line-post insulator, and it can easily be applied to new and/or built insulators. The leakage current is indirectly calculated from the potential difference between the metal electrode attached {{on the surface of}} insulator and the <b>ground</b> <b>connector.</b> To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, the leakage current is compared as a function of contamination condition controlled by the density of NaCl solution. The leakage current is proportioned to the density of NaCl solution, and the voltage detected by the electrode showed the same trend. From the experimental results, we designed and fabricated a monitoring device which is composed of a detection electrode, signal converter...|$|E

40|$|AbstractAs many {{contemporary}} Photovoltaic (PV) Power systems being installed {{are designed to}} produce significant amount of electricity and claimed to operate for 25 years or more, appropriate grounding on PV modules to reduce or eliminate shock and fire hazards becomes a critical issue under high electricity output and long-term use. Although some PV manufacturers have provided technical bulletins to suggest grounding products and methods, {{not all of them}} have been carefully evaluated and reviewed by the certification/listing laboratories. In this paper, different types of PV <b>grounding</b> <b>connectors</b> were collected, installed and put into accelerated environmental test chambers.

50|$|Like all {{industrial}} sites, the buildings, {{the antenna}} masts, the generators, and the transmitting equipment of the stations should be grounded for personal safety against electrical shocks. On the masts and roofs, lightning rods should be used. For transmitter stations working on frequencies below 30 MHz a good grounding {{is required for}} good function and sometimes excessive grounding systems are used. In most cases, it is desirable to connect the rods to each other to form a simple Faraday cage. But in high altitude stations, the ground is usually rocky and finding an appropriate point for the grounding bus may be impossible. In such cases, very long <b>grounding</b> <b>connectors</b> {{may be used to}} find a good ground at lower altitudes.|$|R

50|$|The 3/180¬∞ and 5/180¬∞ {{connectors}} {{were originally}} standardized and {{widely used in}} European countries for interconnecting analog audio equipment. For example, a stereo tape recorder could connect to a stereo amplifier using the five pins for the four signal connections plus <b>ground.</b> The <b>connectors</b> on the cord are connected pin for pin, (pin 1 to pin 1, etc.). Pins on male connectors are numbered (from right to left, viewed from outside of the connector, with the 5 pins upwards, and facing them): 1-4-2-5-3. Holes on female connectors are also numbered 1-4-2-5-3, but {{from left to right}} (facing the holes). A four-conductor cord wired in this way is sometimes called a DIN cord, a DIN lead or a DIN cable. For mono interconnections, the 3/180¬∞ plugs are sufficient. When a mono plug is inserted into a stereo socket, it mates with the left channel. This interface was rare in the U.S. market, and has progressively disappeared on new equipment, both in Germany and worldwide, since the 1980s, in favour of RCA connectors.|$|R

25|$|When Munich {{was awarded}} the Olympic Summer Games 1972 in 1965, the U-Bahn network concept (which was adopted only one year earlier) had to be revised {{to speed up the}} {{construction}} of a connection to the Olympic venues at Olympic <b>grounds.</b> The Olympic <b>connector</b> (now U3) was redesigned as a branch of the U6 line, because the original plan of a direct connection to the Olympic ground from Munich Central Station was not feasible in the shortness of time. This original U3 sections consists of four stations (from north to south): Olympiazentrum, Petuelring, Scheidplatz, where cross-platform interchange to the U2 (the line originally supposed to serve the Olympic venues) is possible since 1980, and Bonner Platz. After Bonner Platz the U3 reaches M√ºnchner Freiheit, where it joins the U6 to run together through the inner city section to Implerstra√üe (for this section see U6 below).|$|R
40|$|Electrical cables that {{dissipate}} spurious static electric charges, {{in addition}} to performing their main functions of conducting signals, have been developed. These cables are intended for use in trapped-ion or ionizing-radiation environments, in which electric charges tend to accumulate within, and on the surfaces of, dielectric layers of cables. If the charging rate exceeds the dissipation rate, charges can accumulate in excessive amounts, giving rise to high-current discharges that can damage electronic circuitry and/or systems connected to it. The basic idea of design and operation of charge-dissipative electrical cables is to drain spurious charges to ground by use of lossy (slightly electrically conductive) dielectric layers, possibly in conjunction with drain wires and/or drain shields (see figure). In typical cases, the drain wires and/or drain shields could be electrically <b>grounded</b> via the <b>connector</b> assemblies {{at the ends of}} the cables, in any of the conventional techniques for grounding signal conductors and signal shields. In some cases, signal shields could double as drain shields...|$|R
