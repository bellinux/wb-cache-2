5000|$|In {{the early}} 20th century the breed {{remained}} in vogue for high society, with dogs changing hands {{for up to}} $3,000 and being owned by members of influential families such as the Rockefellers and the <b>J.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>Morgans.</b> The American Kennel Club recognised the breed quickly after the breed club was formed, and by 1906 the French Bulldog was the fifth most popular dog breed in America. In 2013, the American Kennel Club (AKC) ranked the French Bulldog as the 11th most popular breed in the United States, enjoying a sharp rise in popularity from 54th place a decade before, in 2003.

5|$|After the Taft-Díaz summit, Burnham led {{a team of}} 500 men in {{guarding}} mining properties {{owned by}} Hammond, <b>J.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>Morgan,</b> and the Guggenheims in the Mexican state of Sonora. Just as the irrigation and mining projects were nearing completion in 1912, {{a long series of}} Mexican revolutions began. The final blow to these efforts came in 1917 when Mexico passed laws prohibiting the sale of land to foreigners. Burnham and Hammond carried their properties until 1930 and then sold them to the Mexican government.|$|E
5|$|Financier and philanthropist <b>J.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>Morgan,</b> Jr. {{returned}} from a two-month trip to Europe in November 1912; his wife followed him home the next month. Also arriving on George Washingtons November crossing was Mary Garden, a Scottish-born soprano, who was returning from a sabbatical in Scotland. The next month, opera singers Frieda Hempel and Leon Rains, both headed for appearances with the Metropolitan Opera, arrived on the same voyage as Mrs. Morgan. Hempel, a German soprano, was with the Berlin Royal Opera, and American tenor Rains was with the Saxon Royal Opera of Dresden.|$|E
5|$|Rapid {{economic}} development {{during the late}} 19th and early 20th centuries fostered the rise of many prominent industrialists. Tycoons like Cornelius Vanderbilt, John D. Rockefeller, and Andrew Carnegie led the nation's progress in railroad, petroleum, and steel industries. Banking became {{a major part of}} the economy, with <b>J.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>Morgan</b> playing a notable role. Edison and Tesla undertook the widespread distribution of electricity to industry, homes, and for street lighting. Henry Ford revolutionized the automotive industry. The American economy boomed, becoming the world's largest, and the United States achieved great power status. These dramatic changes were accompanied by social unrest and the rise of populist, socialist, and anarchist movements. This period eventually ended with the advent of the Progressive Era, which saw significant reforms in many societal areas, including women's suffrage, alcohol prohibition, regulation of consumer goods, greater antitrust measures to ensure competition and attention to worker conditions.|$|E
40|$|Early in Richard Wright's Native Son, we see Bigger and {{his friend}} Gus &# 8220;playing white. &# 8221; Taking {{on the role of}} &# 8220;J. P. Morgan,&# 8221; the two young black men give orders and act powerful, thus {{performing}} their perceived role of whiteness. This scene is more than an ironic comment on the characters' distance from the lifestyle of the <b>J.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>Morgans</b> of the world; their acts of whiteness are a representation of how whiteness is constructed. Such an analysis is similar to my own focus in this dissertation. I argue that whiteness is a culturally constructed identity and that work serves as a performative space for defining and transgressing whiteness. To this end, I examine work and its influence on the performance of middle class and working class whiteness, as well as how those outside the definitions of whiteness attempt to &# 8220;play white,&# 8221; as Bigger does. Work enables me to explore the codes of whiteness and how they are performed, understood, and transgressed by providing a locus of cultural performance. Furthermore, by looking at novels written in the early twentieth century, I am able to analyze characters at a historical moment in which work was of great import. With the labor movement at its peak, these novels, particularly those which specifically address socialism, participate in an understanding of work as a performative act more than a means to end. Within the context of this history and using the language of whiteness studies, I look at how gendered whiteness is transgressed and reinforced through the inverted job-roles of the Knapps in Dorothy Canfield's The Home-Maker, how work can cause those who possess the physical attributes of whiteness to transgress this cultural identity, as the Joads in The Grapes of Wrath demonstrate, and how the ascribed identities as non-white for Sara in The Bread Givers, Jurgis in The Jungle, and Bigger in Native Son are by far more compelling than their performative acts...|$|R
40|$|The Thurston {{compactification}} of Teichmüller spaces {{has been}} generalized to many different representation spaces by <b>J.</b> <b>Morgan,</b> <b>P.</b> Shalen, M. Bestvina, F. Paulin, A. Parreau and others. In the simplest case of representations of fundamental groups of closed hyperbolic surfaces in PSL(2, R), we prove that this compactification is very degenerated: the nice behaviour of the Thurston compactification of the Teichmüller space contrasts with wild phenomena {{happening on the}} boundary of the other connected components of these representation spaces. We prove {{that it is more}} natural to consider a refinement of this compactification, which remembers the orientation of the hyperbolic plane. The ideal points of this compactification are fat R-trees, i. e., R-trees equipped with a planar structure...|$|R
5000|$|After Kletting {{produced}} more detailed plans, {{they were made}} available to contractors interested in bidding {{to work on the}} capitol. The submitted bids were opened December 3, 1912 at Salt Lake's Commercial Club with James Stewart & Company receiving the contract as general contractor on December 19, 1912. <b>P.</b> <b>J.</b> <b>Morgan</b> was awarded the contract for excavation and grading the site, and the capitol's groundbreaking ceremony took place December 26, 1912. A large amount of soil had to be excavated from the hill side, as {{the eastern side of the}} site was as high as the building's planned fourth story. The excavation was done using a steam shovel which dug into the hillside filling its large dipper, after which it turned around and emptied the dirt into a temporary Dinkey train. The small train then carried the soil to the nearby City Creek Canyon where it was dumped. [...] After the building's base was graded and excavated, work on the foundation started. The capitol was to be built of stone, with a concrete and steel superstructure.|$|R
5|$|Colonel E. R. Bradley, one of {{the wealthiest}} {{residents}} of Palm Beach and owner of a casino in the town, donated $10,000. <b>J.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>Morgan</b> gave also $10,000 to the Red Cross. Then-gubernatorial candidate Doyle E. Carlton contributed $10,000 on September20 after surveying the damage. A creamery in West Palm Beach quickly distributed 1,400gallons of milk. In Miami, WQAM hosted a telethon on September22, which also included live entertainment from a Shriners band at a park amphitheater. The event collected about $1,000 for the victims of the storm. The city of Miami also donated 2tanks of chlorine, 20barrels of disinfectant, 24lanterns, and 5,000paper cups. City council members of San Francisco, which suffered from a devastating earthquake in 1906, agreed to donate $10,000 to South Florida without discussion. Issaquena County, Mississippi, among the most ravaged by a Great Mississippi Flood of 1927, also contributed money. Although many railroad stations south of Kelsey City were damaged, train service was restored on the morning of September17. Railroad companies provided free fare to storm victims until October4, a service used by 1,427people. After that day, the Red Cross paid for the transportation of people who were destitute.|$|E
5|$|Harrison was {{admitted}} to the New York State bar in 1892 and worked for the law firm Bangs, Stetson, Tracy & MacVeagh from 1892 to 1896. He then joined the Southern Railway Company in May 1896 as a lawyer, becoming an assistant to the company's president in 1903. He served as vice-president in charge of finance and accounting from 1906. During the Panic of 1907, Harrison successfully persuaded <b>J.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>Morgan</b> to purchase bonds in the Southern to keep the company solvent. After the panic had subsided, Harrison was named president of the Chicago, Indianapolis and Louisville Railway, later the Monon Railroad (succeeded Ira G. Rawn after Rawn's death), which was jointly owned by Southern and the Louisville & Nashville Railroad. William Finley, president of the Southern Railway, died on November 23, 1913, and Harrison was elected as his successor eight days later. Besides the chairmanship of the Southern Railway, he was also elected to succeed Finley on three subsidiary railroads. His election was considered to be a sign of change in the Southern United States, especially in its railroads, both because he was a southerner and for his activism on behalf of the south.|$|E
5|$|The Tennessee Coal, Iron and Railroad Company's {{status was}} bolstered {{when it became}} one of the first 12 {{companies}} to be listed on the inaugural Dow Jones Industrial Average, compiled in May 1896. However, it was not long before TCI was eclipsed by its principal competitor, the United States Steel Corporation, a huge conglomerate formed in 1901 out of the enormous Carnegie and Federal steel empires. By the time of the Panic of 1907, U. S. Steel felt confident enough to launch a takeover bid of its Southern rival. On the morning of Saturday November 2, banker and tycoon <b>J.</b> <b>P.</b> <b>Morgan,</b> one of the founders of U. S. Steel, convened a meeting in his library and there suggested that U. S. Steel purchase the stock of an insolvent Wall Street brokerage firm, Moore and Schley, which had secured huge loans against 6 million TCI shares. This was not an entirely selfish gesture, as Morgan recognised that the failure of Moore and Schley would send investor confidence in the markets into a nose-dive. E. H. Gary, president of U. S. Steel, agreed in principle to this transaction, yet argued that without careful political maneuvering the deal would be seen by Congress as an effort to create a monopoly and thereby encounter troublesome federal anti-trust litigation. Morgan himself had been burnt by crusading Washington trust-busters in 1902 when his Northern Securities Company had been forcibly broken up by the government in a landmark test case.|$|E
