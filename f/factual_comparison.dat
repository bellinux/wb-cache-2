When {{the subject of the}} debate turned to Quayle's relatively limited experience in public life, he compared the length of his congressional service (12 years) with that of late President John F. Kennedy (14 years), as Kennedy had less experience than his rivals during the 1960 presidential nomination. It was a <b>factual</b> <b>comparison,</b> although Quayle's advisers cautioned beforehand that it could be used against him. Bentsen's response – [...] "Senator, you're no Jack Kennedy" [...] – subsequently became a part of the political lexicon. During the debate, Quayle's strategy was to criticize Dukakis as too liberal.|$|E
40|$|The {{prominent}} {{place of the}} chapter on poverty in the Johannesburg Plan of Implementation (JPI) is totally {{in keeping with the}} priority given to poverty reduction in the development thinking of the international community of today. The Johannesburg process did not lead to any new insights or new commitments in the fight against poverty. Section one sets out a <b>factual</b> <b>comparison</b> of the poverty chapters in Rio's Agenda 21 (AG 21) and in the JPI. Section two reviews the conceptual links between poverty reduction and sustainable development, since poverty is used both as a dependent and as an independent variable. This analysis shows a shift in the function of growth as related to environmental protection. Section three explores the naturalization of development thinking in its economic and social dimensions and shows how this affects the policy options for social protection. I also explain how social and environmental sustainability have become elements of risk management and how are both aimed at conflict prevention and enhanced growth. Finally, in section four three lines of action are suggested to enhance the emergence of a socially meaningful sustainable development agenda that, ideally, would make poverty reduction strategies redundant. © 2005 Springer.

40|$|The {{goal of this}} {{dissertation}} {{thesis is}} the comparison of two Czech translations of the book Quo vadis by the Polish writer Henryk Sienkiewicz's. The First chapter contains writer's biography. The second chapter is about novel's origin, historical background of the plot and a short character profile. The end of this chapter {{is focused on the}} Christian and Pagan background of the book. Next part of the thesis is mainly theoretical and is focused on translatability. First we dissert upon the following definitions: translational equivalence and adequacy. There are also defined the ways of translation such as the literal translation, loose translation and adequate translation. Than we continue by chapter called the "selected issues of translation used as a communication device in connection with the linguistic issues. There are defined the following terms: translation as a communication device and translation as an act of bilingual communication and there are also mentioned linguistic issues of translation and the intentions of the interpreter which are focused on the reader. There are also mentioned the modernisation and archaisation of the translation. After this chapter follows the <b>factual</b> <b>comparison</b> of the differences in translation from every language point of view and the final commentary...|$|E

The anticipated growth of traffic demand will cause the current airspace system, one that is already burdened by heavy operations and inefficient usage, to become even more congested than its current state. Because busy airports in the United States (U. S.) are becoming 2 ̆ 2 bottlenecks 2 ̆ 2 of the National Airspace System (NAS), it is of great importance to discover the most efficient means of using existing facilities to improve airport operations. This dissertation aims at designing an efficient airport surface operations management system that substantially contributes to the modernized NAS. First, a global comparison is conducted in the major airports within the U. S. and Europe in order to understand, compare, and explore the differences of surface operational efficiency in two systems. The comparison results are then presented for each airport pair with respect to various operational performance metrics, as well as airport capacity and different demand patterns. A detailed summary of the associated Air Traffic Management (ATM) strategies that are implemented in the U. S. and Europe can be found towards the end of this work. These strategies include: a single Air Navigation Service Provider (ANSP) in the U. S. and multiple ANSPs in Europe, airline scheduling and demand management differences, mixed usage of Instrument Flight Rule (IFR) and Visual Flight Rules (VFR) operations in the U. S., and varying gate management policies in two regions. For global comparison, unimpeded taxi time is the reference time used for measuring taxi performance. It has been noted that different methodologies are currently used to benchmark taxi times by the performance analysis groups in the U. S. and Europe, namely the Federal Aviation Authority (FAA) and EUROCONTROL. The consistent methodology to measure taxi efficiency is needed for the facilitation of global benchmarking. Therefore, after an in-depth <b>factual</b> <b>comparison</b> conducted for two varying methodologies, new methods to measure unimpeded taxi times are explored through various tools, including simulation software and projection of historical surveillance data. Moreover, a sophisticated statistical model is proposed as a state-of-the-art method to measure taxi efficiency while quantifying the impact of various factors to taxi inefficiency and supporting decision-makers with reliable measurements to improve the operational performance. Lastly, a real-time integrated airport surface operations management (RTI-ASOM) is presented to fulfil the third objective of this dissertation. It provides optimal trajectories for each aircraft between gates and runways with the objective of minimizing taxi delay and maximizing runway throughput. The use of Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MIP) formulation, Dynamic Programming for decomposition, and CPLEX optimization can permit the use of an efficient solution algorithm that can instantly solve the large-scale optimization problem. Examples are shown based on one-day track data at LaGuardia Airport (LGA) in New York City. In additional to base scenarios with historical data, simulation through MATLAB is constructed to provide further comparable scenarios, which can demonstrate a significant reduction of taxi times and improvement of runway utilization in RTI-ASOM. By strategically holding departures at gates, the application of RTI-ASOM also reduces excess delay on the airport surface, decreases fuel consumption at airports, and mitigates the consequential environmental impacts...|$|E

40|$|The use of well understood, legacy {{elements}} of the Space Shuttle system could yield a near-term, high-confidence Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle that offers significant performance, reliability, schedule, risk, cost, and work force transition benefits. A side-mount Shuttle-Derived Vehicle (SDV) concept has been defined that has major improvements over previous Shuttle-C concepts. This SDV is shown to carry crew plus large logistics payloads to the ISS, support an operationally efficient and cost effective program of lunar exploration, and offer the potential to support commercial launch operations. This paper provides the latest data and estimates on the configurations, performance, concept of operations, reliability and safety, development schedule, risks, costs, and work force transition opportunities for this optimized side-mount SDV concept. The results {{presented in this paper}} have been based on established models and fully validated analysis tools used by the Space Shuttle Program, and are consistent with similar analysis tools commonly used throughout the aerospace industry. While these results serve as a <b>factual</b> basis for <b>comparisons</b> with other launch system architectures, no such comparisons are presented in this paper. The authors welcome comparisons between this optimized SDV and other Heavy Lift Launch Vehicle concepts...|$|R
40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{a study of the}} theory of {{scalability}} and its application in an infrastructure as a service (IaaS) cloud context. The cloud based utility computing paradigm is presented along with how scalability principles are applied in the cloud. The differences of scalability in general and the cloud concept of elasticity are discussed. A quality of elasticity (QoE) metric is developed to facilitate <b>factual</b> discussion and <b>comparison</b> of different cloud platforms' elasticity capabilities and the effectiveness of elastic scaling strategies. The metric is based on business requirements expressed as preference functions over a set of lower level metrics. Multi-criteria analysis is applied to these possibly conflicting preferences to arrive at a unified value of utility based on weighting the sum of the preferences. QoE reflects the utility of the system over time. The concept of an elasticity controller application is presented and a prototype implementation described in order to exercise the QoE metric. Two load testing scenarios are executed against a simple test application whose deployment is managed by the prototype controller. The elastic scaling behavior of the system is analyzed in terms of the QoE results to confirm the prototype is functional and to find areas of improvement...|$|R

U SAD-u postoje razni modeli “projekata nedužnosti”. Jedna od ključnih metoda u preispitivanju je provođenje naknadnog vještačenja DNK-a, što je rezultiralo oslobođenjem približno 300 osuđenih osoba. U konačnici “projekti nedužnosti” doveli su do preispitivanja i ispravljanja pogrešaka pravosudnih sustava oslobođenjem nedužnih osoba. Osim toga, u velikom broju slučajeva doveli su i do otkrivanja i osude pravog počinitelja. Tema je ovoga članaka mogu li “projekti nedužnosti”, pogotovo oni temeljeni na naknadnom DNK vještačenju, zaživjeti i u hrvatskom pravnom sustavu. Na načelnoj razini nema razloga da razvoj znanosti i mogućnosti koje taj razvoj donosi ne nađu širu primjenu i u hrvatskom pravnom sustavu. Na tom su tragu i zaključci ovoga rada u kojem se obrađuju dva ključna pitanja: implementacija “projekata nedužnosti” u hrvatski pravni sustav i oživotvorenje tih projekata na temelju provođenja naknadnog DNK vještačenja. “Innocence Projects”, {{primarily}} in the United States, but also in other countries {{where they have been}} introduced, allow persons convicted of crimes to have their cases re-examined in order to establish their innocence. In the United States there are various models of “Innocence Projects”. Regardless of the model, one of the key methods used to prove someone´s innocence is DNA testing. This method has resulted in the release of approximately 300 convicted persons in the USA. More importantly, the implementation of “Innocence Projects” leads to a re-examination and correction of errors within the judicial system, possibly resulting in the release of innocent convicted persons. In addition, in a large number of cases, the gathering of DNA evidence has led to the identification and conviction of the real perpetrator. This paper examines whether “Innocence Projects”, especially those based on subsequent DNA expert testimony, can also be invoked in the Croatian legal system. There is no reason why the development of science and the opportunities it brings should not find a wider application in the Croatian legal system. The aim and conclusions of this paper concern the following: the implementation of an appropriate model of the various existing “Innocence Projects” in the Croatian legal system and the realization of a project based on the implementation of subsequent DNA expert testimony. Following research and a subsequent analysis of relevant regulations, the authors suggest that there are no legal obstacles to the introduction and implementation of some of the models of “Innocence Projects” in the Republic of Croatia. However, some observed shortcomings and legal gaps, especially those relating to the storage of evidence that contains biological traces in Croatia, may hamper or slow down a successful implementation of these projects. It is therefore expected that introducing an “Innocence Project” could contribute to the enhancement of the legal regulation on the collection, storage and usage of DNA evidence in criminal proceedings. The application of Article 501 of the Criminal Procedure Act, which refers to the reopening of criminal proceedings, could serve as the legal basis for correcting the errors made by the judiciary when an innocent person is convicted, imprisoned or sanctioned. However, such a procedure could, in a great majority of cases, be carried out in the course of reopened criminal proceedings only if the biological material is collected, preserved and stored; otherwise, DNA material subsequently collected from convicted persons will provide no <b>factual</b> possibility of <b>comparison.</b> Furthermore, as their conducted research, the authors propose that “Innocence Projects” would best be implemented through already existing legal clinics, which already have quite substantial experience with providing legal aid, especially at the Faculty of Law of the University of Zagreb. Hence, we are of the opinion that all persons, wrongfully convicted regardless of the offence, should have the possibility to use DNA testing, but only if they might be really truly innocent, i. e. if it is very likely that they are not the perpetrators of the criminal offense of which they have been convicted. Therefore, we propose a model where applicants eligible for legal aid should not only be those that have been wrongfully convicted due to procedural mistakes, but those who have compelling arguments to support their claim of innocence despite the conviction [...] According to the authors, a fitting model is one developed at the Cincinnati University Legal Aid Clinic. Preliminary research into whether the person might be truly innocent would be the task of the legal aid provider within the selected “Innocence Project”. After this preliminary research, the legal aid clinic would participate, to the extent possible with regard to Croatian law, in initiating and conducting the procedure of reopening the criminal proceedings. To fulfil the mentioned goals, based on the experiences in the USA, the consequent DNA testing and comparison between kept materials could be the only solution for proving innocence. Last but not least, a possible implementation of an “Innocence Project” in Croatia would ultimately give legitimacy to the justice system, while recognizing that the system is mature enough to acknowledge and correct its own mistakes...|$|R
