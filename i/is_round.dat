5|$|The Murray cod {{is a large}} grouper-like {{fish with}} a deep, {{elongated}} body that <b>is</b> <b>round</b> in cross section. It has a broad, scooped head, and a large mouth lined with pads of very small, needle-like teeth. The jaws of the Murray cod are equal, or the lower jaw protrudes slightly.|$|E
5|$|The type {{specimen}} preserves the right canine. Like other therocephalians, the canine of Euchambersia was very large, {{resulting in a}} specialized predatory lifestyle that incorporates a sabertooth bite into prey killing. It <b>is</b> <b>round</b> in cross-section, and bears a prominent ridge {{on the side of}} its front surface. Immediately beside this ridge is a shallow depression that becomes wider {{near the top of the}} tooth, which is probably the same structure as the groove interpreted by some authors. Theriodonts usually replace their teeth in an alternating (or distichial) pattern, such that the canine tooth is always functional; both skulls of Euchambersia show no sign of any replacement teeth developing, suggesting that Euchambersia was reliant on having both canines present and functional simultaneously.|$|E

The resulting value <b>is</b> <b>rounded</b> to the next German grade (e.g. 1.6 <b>is</b> <b>rounded</b> to the German grade 1.7 and 2.4 <b>is</b> <b>rounded</b> to 2.3). For resulting values between two German grades, the score <b>is</b> <b>rounded</b> to the better grade (e.g. 2.5 <b>is</b> <b>rounded</b> to the German grade 2.3 and 1.15 <b>is</b> <b>rounded</b> to 1.0).|$|R

5|$|The cheekteeth {{increase}} {{regularly in}} size from front to back. They all consist of a large central basin surrounded by cusps and crests. The basins are deeper than in Palaeosciurus and Ratufa obtusidens and lack crenulations in the enamel, which distinguishes them from another fossil squirrel, Albanensia. The first cheekteeth, p4, is large and about triangular in form, short and quite broad at the back. The two cusps at the front, the protoconid and metaconid, are isolated from each other. In front of the metaconid, {{there is a small}} cuspule, an anteroconid, at the lingual side of the tooth (the side of the tongue). The central basin of the tooth is relatively deep. At the back of the tooth, the entoconid cusp is connected to the posterolophid, a crest that forms the back margin. Of the two roots, the one at the front <b>is</b> <b>round</b> and the one at the back is broad.|$|E

25|$|Its body <b>is</b> <b>round,</b> {{particularly}} when well fed, and tapers less smoothly {{to the head}} than the tail. The sudden tapering {{to the base of}} its neck gives it the appearance of shoulders, unique among cetaceans. The tailfin grows and becomes increasingly and ornately curved as the animal ages. The flippers are broad and short—making them almost square-shaped.|$|E
25|$|Females {{lay their}} eggs singly on the host plant leaves, preferring to oviposit on host plants near nectar sources. The egg <b>is</b> <b>round</b> and green, later turning {{yellowish}} green with reddish dots. The size of the egg is large for a butterfly, being 0.8millimeters (0.03in) in height and 1.2millimeters (0.05in) in width. It takes between 4 and 10 days to hatch.|$|E

When more {{precision}} is needed, katastarsko jutro (meaning cadastral jutro) is used, that equals exactly 0.5754642 hectares (5,754.642 square meters).|$|R

25|$|The female {{butterfly}} {{goes from}} plant to plant, laying a single egg {{at a time}} {{on top of a}} leaf which it holds onto with its legs, and flies off as soon as the egg is laid. The egg <b>is</b> <b>round,</b> light yellowish in colour, flattened at the base, smooth surfaced and about 1.5mm in height. Fertile eggs develop a small red mark at the apex.|$|E
25|$|The sex of kittens {{is usually}} easy to {{determine}} at birth. By {{six to eight}} weeks they are harder to sex because of the growth of fur in the genital region. The male's urethral opening <b>is</b> <b>round,</b> whereas the female's urethral opening is a slit. Another marked difference is the distance between anus and urethral opening, which is greater in males than in females.|$|E
25|$|A coypu {{is often}} {{mistaken for a}} muskrat, another widely dispersed, semiaquatic rodent that {{occupies}} the same wetland habitats. The muskrat, however, is smaller and more tolerant of cold climates, and has a laterally flattened tail it uses to assist in swimming, whereas {{the tail of a}} coypu <b>is</b> <b>round.</b> It can also be mistaken for a small beaver, as beavers and coypus have very similar anatomies. However, beavers' tails are flat and paddle-like, as opposed to the round tails of coypus.|$|E

25|$|Also, a more {{detailed}} description about the cosmos, Stars, Sun, Moon and the Earth {{can be found in}} the Orphism, which dates back to the end of the 5th century BC, and it is probably even older. Within the lyrics of the Orphic poems we can find remarkable information such as that the Earth <b>is</b> <b>round,</b> it has an axis and it moves around it in one day, it has three climate zones and that the Sun magnetizes the Stars and planets.|$|E
25|$|The medal <b>is</b> <b>round</b> in gold, {{silver and}} bronze versions, with a {{suspension}} {{in the form}} of a royal crown with two pendelia and a ribbon ring. The obverse shows a finely ribbed central area with bead surround, with the royal crown superimposed. The surrounding circlet carries the motto of the Belgian Congo: Travail et Progrès (work and progress) —the later issues are bilingual including the Dutch Arbeid en Vooruitgang in the lower half of the circlet. The reverse is a stylised 'double L' crowned Leopold II monogram within a palm wreath.|$|E
25|$|Though {{capable of}} sprinting, the cougar is {{typically}} an ambush predator. It stalks through brush and trees, across ledges, or other covered spots, before delivering a powerful leap {{onto the back}} of its prey and a suffocating neck bite. The cougar is capable of breaking the neck of some of its smaller prey with a strong bite and momentum bearing the animal to the ground. The head of the cat <b>is</b> <b>round</b> and the ears are erect. Its powerful forequarters, neck, and jaw serve to grasp and hold large prey. It has five retractable claws on its forepaws (one a dewclaw) and four on its hind paws. The larger front feet and claws are adaptations to clutching prey.|$|E

25|$|Lucilia cuprina is {{a species}} of blow fly {{characterized}} by a metallic outer appearance and reddish eyes. They usually have a shiny green or greenish/blue abdomen with bronze/coppery reflections. Because of this, Lucilia species are known as the bronze bottle flies. Their body shape <b>is</b> <b>round</b> to oval and their length varies from 4.5–10 millimeters. They have two pairs of wings, the first pair being membranous wings and the second pair being reduced wings known as halteres which are used for flight stabilization. Adults are easy to distinguish due to bristles on the meron, {{in addition to the}} arista, the prominent hair on the terminal antennal segment being plumose, or feathery. L. cuprina are most easily identified by their strong dorsal setae and their black thoracic spiracle.|$|E
25|$|The {{church is}} a {{miniature}} building, which belongs {{to the type of}} the four-apse centric round monuments of the 10th to 13th centuries such as the church of St. Gregory in Sanahin. But as distinct from them the church of Astvatsatsin <b>is</b> <b>round</b> only in its lower part and octahedral in its upper part, with four triangular niches crowned with various conchs. The dome is proportionate to the lower round bulk. The decoration of the church is in stylistic harmony with that of the main temple and the narthex. The profiled girth skirting the building passes across the ends of the niches and the window openings. On the northern side there are eye-catching reliefs of a stork and a snake, and over the southern window a scene showing two beasts locked in a fight.|$|E
25|$|The head of {{the queen}} snake is narrow and has nine large plate-like scales on the top, and the chin has several rows of thicker scales. This is a {{protective}} adaptation, for the snake's feeding habit of chasing its prey under rocks. The pupil of the eye <b>is</b> <b>round,</b> a feature shared with most other colubrids. There are 19 rows of keeled dorsal scales at midbody, and the anal plate is divided. The sexes are often difficult to distinguish based on external characteristics. Male queen snakes have relatively longer tails than females. Males have from 65 to 89 subcaudal scutes (average 76), with the tail from 23% to 34% of the snake's total length. Females have 54 to 87 subcaudals (average 69), with tails equal to 19% to 27% of total length.|$|E
