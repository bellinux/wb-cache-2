25|$|After a {{redesign}} in 1983, the VIC-II was {{encased in}} a plastic <b>dual</b> <b>in-line</b> <b>package,</b> which reduced costs substantially, {{but it did not}} totally eliminate the heat problem. Without a ceramic package, the VIC-II required the use of a heat sink. To avoid extra cost, the metal RF shielding doubled as the heat sink for the VIC, although not all units shipped with this type of shielding. Most C64s in Europe shipped with a cardboard RF shield, coated with a layer of metal foil. The effectiveness of the cardboard was highly questionable, and worse still it acted as an insulator, blocking airflow which trapped heat generated by the SID, VIC, and PLA chips. The SID was originally manufactured using NMOS at 7 and in some areas 6 micrometers. The prototype SID and some very early production models featured a ceramic <b>dual</b> <b>in-line</b> <b>package,</b> but unlike the VIC-II, these are extremely rare as the SID was encased in plastic when production started in early 1982.|$|E
2500|$|The VIC-II was {{manufactured}} with 5 micrometer NMOS {{technology and}} was clocked at either [...] (PAL) or [...] (NTSC). Internally, the clock was divided down {{to generate the}} dot clock (about 8MHz) and the two-phase system clocks (about 1MHz; the exact pixel and system clock speeds are slightly different between NTSC and PAL machines). At such high clock rates, the chip generated a lot of heat, forcing MOS Technology to use a ceramic <b>dual</b> <b>in-line</b> <b>package</b> called a [...] "CERDIP". The ceramic package was more expensive, but it dissipated heat more effectively than plastic.|$|E

2500|$|The μA709 was {{introduced}} in November 1965 and became Fairchild's revolutionary flagship product. For a few years, Fairchild was the leader {{in the field of}} linear ICs. Demand for its products exceeded its production capacity by a factor of ten; Fairchild's circuits were sold out for two years in advance. Gifford, one of the few men who fully understood Widlar and his work, contributed to the market boom by introducing a <b>dual</b> <b>in-line</b> <b>package.</b> According to Don Valentine, [...] "at one point in time [...] were responsible — one designed them and one made them — for more than eighty percent of the linear circuits made and sold in the world". None of Fairchild's competitors came close to matching its status in the market. Fairchild patented Widlar's innovations but never licensed them and never enforced their rights in court. Competitors created clones of μA709 but only Philco succeeded in producing one that fully matched the original.|$|E

50|$|Like most {{integrated}} circuits {{of the period}} 1963-1990, commercial TTL devices are usually <b>packaged</b> in <b>dual</b> <b>in-line</b> <b>packages</b> (DIPs), usually with 14 to 24 pins, for through-hole or socket mounting. The DIPs were usually made of epoxy plastic (PDIP) for commercial-grade parts or of ceramic (CDIP) for military-grade parts.|$|R
50|$|Today, surface-mounted CMOS {{versions}} of the 7400 series are used in various applications in electronics and for glue logic in computers and industrial electronics. The original through-hole devices in <b>dual</b> <b>in-line</b> <b>packages</b> (DIP/DIL) were the mainstay of the industry for many decades. They are useful for rapid breadboard-prototyping and for education and remain available from most manufacturers. The fastest types and very low voltage versions are typically surface-mount only, however.|$|R

50|$|The {{increasingly}} popular integrated circuits in <b>dual</b> <b>in-line</b> <b>packages</b> would only fit the 0.1 boards. Very soon 0.1 pitch became {{by far the}} dominant form. Integrated circuits and the common layout of short parallel strips protruding {{from the sides of}} an IC package encouraged the development of specialist boards such as Verostrip. This was a long, thin board with the copper strips arranged transversely, rather than the usual lengthwise. A ready-cut central gap was provided to isolate the sides of the IC.|$|R
30|$|The TRNGs were {{assembled}} as 28 -pin <b>dual</b> <b>in-line</b> (DIP) <b>packages.</b> Two {{types of}} TRNGs were fabricated: 20 standard TRNGs (using CS 86 MN, called “MN-TRNG”) and 19 low-power-consuming TRNGs (using CS 86 ML, called “ML-TRNG”).|$|R
50|$|The 7400 {{series of}} TTL {{integrated}} circuits started appearing in minicomputers {{in the late}} 1960s. The 74181 arithmetic logic unit (ALU) was commonly used in the CPU data paths. Each 74181 had a bus width of four bits, hence the popularity of bit-slice architecture. Some scientific computers, such as the Nicolet 1080, would use the 7400 series in groups of five ICs (parallel) for their uncommon twenty bits architecture. The 7400 series offered data-selectors, multiplexers, three-state buffers, memories, etc. in <b>dual</b> <b>in-line</b> <b>packages</b> with one-tenth inch spacing, making major system components and architecture evident to the naked eye.

Interconnecting wires and the leads of discrete components (such as capacitors, resistors, and inductors) can be inserted into the remaining free holes to complete the circuit. Where ICs are not used, discrete components and connecting wires may use any of the holes. Typically the spring clips are rated for 1 ampere at 5 volts and 0.333 amperes at 15 volts (5 watts).

5000|$|The zig-zag <b>in-line</b> <b>package</b> or ZIP was a {{short-lived}} packaging technology for integrated circuits, particularly dynamic RAM chips. It {{was intended as}} a replacement for <b>dual</b> <b>in-line</b> <b>packaging</b> (DIL or DIP). A ZIP is an integrated circuit encapsulated in a slab of plastic with 20 or 40 pins, measuring (for the ZIP-20 package) about 3 mm x 30 mm x 10 mm. The package's pins protrude in two rows from one of the long edges. The two rows are staggered by 1.27 mm (0.05"), giving them a zig-zag appearance, and allowing them to be spaced more closely than a rectangular grid would allow. The pins are inserted into holes in a printed circuit board, with the packages standing at right-angles to the board, allowing them to be placed closer together than DIPs of the same size. ZIPs have now been superseded by surface-mount packages such as the thin small-outline packages (TSOPs) used on single-in-line memory modules (SIMMs) and dual-in-line memory modules (DIMMs).|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe natural convection heat transfer {{characteristics of a}} 3 X 3 array of vertical oriented heated protrusions, immersed in a dielectric liquid, were investigated. Aluminum blocks, 24 mm x 8 mm x 6 mm, were used to simulate 20 <b>dual</b> <b>in-line</b> <b>packages.</b> Surface temperature measurements of the components were made by embedding copper-constantan thermocouples {{below the surface of}} each component face. A constant heat flux was provided to each component using an Inconel foil heating element. Power supplied to each component varied from 0. 115 W to 2. 90 W. The aluminum blocks were mounted on a plexiglass enclosure with inner dimensions:I = 203. 2 mm II= 152. 0 mm W = 82. 6 mm, and a wall thickness of 24. 5 mm. The upper boundary was maintained at 10 (o) C, while all other exterior surfaces were insulated. The chamber width, measured {{from the surface of the}} circuit board to the opposite, inner wall of the enclosure, was varied from 42 mm to 7 mm by inserting plexiglass spacers into the enclosure. Two dielectric liquids, FC- 75 and FC- 43, were used as working fluids. Non-dimensional data from this study was combined with the data obtained by Aytar (1991) for a horizontal component orientation, to develop an empirical correlation which predicts the Nusselt number as a function of Rayleigh number, Prandtl number, component orientation and chamber width. This correlation was found to be accurate to within 11 % of the original curve fit data. Heat transfer in FC- 75 was found to occur mainly by convection arising from buoyancy forces, regardless of chamber width. Heat transfer in FC- 43 was found to occur mainly by molecular diffusion for chamber widths of 11 mm or greater, and by convection at a chamber width of 7 mm. The maximum uncertainty in the Nusselt and Rayleigh numbers was 2. 5 %, based on a zeroth order uncertainty analysis, and occurred at the lowest power level, where the maximum uncertainty in the temperature measurement resided.
