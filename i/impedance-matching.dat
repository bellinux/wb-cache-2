25|$|As soon as any {{connection}} within the circuit gets longer than perhaps 1% of the wavelength {{of the highest}} specified frequency (e.g., at 100MHz the wavelength is 3m, so the critical connection length is approx. 3cm) design properties radically change.

40|$|An <b>impedance-matched</b> surface has the {{property}} that an incident wave generates no reflection. Here we demonstrate that {{by using a}} simple construction, an acoustically reflecting surface can acquire hybrid resonances and becomes <b>impedance-matched</b> to airborne sound at tunable frequencies, such that no reflection is generated. Each resonant cell of the metasurface is deep-subwavelength in all its spatial dimensions, with its thickness less than the peak absorption wayelength by two orders of magnitude. As {{there can be no}} transmission, the <b>impedance-matched</b> acoustic wave is hence either completely absorbed at one or multiple frequencies, or converted into other form(s) of energy, such as an electrical current. A high acoustic-electrical energy conversion efficiency of 23 % is achieved...|$|R

40|$|Reflection of plane {{electromagnetic}} waves from an impedance boundary with the surface impedance {{equal to the}} wave impedance of surrounding medium is addressed. It is shown that compared with boundaries with other impedance values, the <b>impedance-matched</b> boundary guarantees the lowest mean reflectance when the incidence directions and polarizations of the incident waves are random and uniformly distributed.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{producing}} quantitative estimates of systematic uncertainties {{generated in the}} analysis of <b>impedance-match</b> shock-wave data is described.

Expressions for the sound speed and Gruneisen coefficient along the principal Hugoniot are also derived with uncertainties.

40|$|The {{compression}} (&# 0951;) {{of liquid}} deuterium between 45 and 220 GPa under laser-driven shock loading has been measured using impedance matching to an aluminum (Al) standard.
