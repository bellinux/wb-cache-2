5|$|Manasa Mangalkavya {{attributes}} Manasa's {{difficulty in}} attracting devotees to an unjust curse she gave to Chand {{in his previous}} life. Chand then retaliated with a counter-curse that worshiping <b>her</b> <b>would</b> not be popular on earth unless he worshiped her also.|$|E
5|$|Although Louis had {{designated}} Mary as {{his successor}} {{in both of}} his kingdoms, the Polish nobles, seeking {{an end to the}} personal union with Hungary, were not willing to recognize Mary and her fiancé Sigismund as their sovereigns. They would have accepted Mary if she had moved to Kraków and reigned over both kingdoms from there rather than from Hungary, ruling according to their advice rather than that of the Hungarian nobles and marrying a prince of their choosing. Their intentions, however, were not to Elizabeth's taste. She too would have been required to move to Kraków, where a lack of men loyal to <b>her</b> <b>would</b> have rendered her unable to enforce her own will. Elizabeth was also aware of the difficulties her mother-in-law had faced during her regency in Poland, which had ended with the old queen fleeing her native kingdom in disgrace.|$|E
5|$|David's time as Prince of the Cumbrians and Earl {{marks the}} {{beginning}} of his life as a great territorial lord. His earldom probably began in 1113, when Henry I arranged David's marriage to Maud, 2nd Countess of Huntingdon, who was the heiress to the Huntingdon–Northampton lordship. As her husband, David used the title of earl, and there was the prospect that David's children by <b>her</b> <b>would</b> inherit all the honours borne by Matilda's father Waltheof. 1113 is the year when David, for the first time, can be found in possession of territory in what is now Scotland.|$|E

50|$|On January 7, 2010, it was {{announced}} that Rick <b>Herring</b> <b>would</b> become the new President and CEO of Giant-Carlisle.|$|R
50|$|Between 10 April 2005 and 25 March 2007, Richard <b>Herring</b> <b>would</b> {{review the}} week's {{newspapers}} on Andrew Collins' BBC 6 Music radio show. These segments would often end with corpsing.|$|R
5|$|Nagatos {{presence}} at Yokosuka was {{revealed to the}} Allies by photographs taken during the 10July raid on the Tokyo area. On 16July Halsey and Vice Admiral Bernard Rawlings, the commander of TF37, met to plan raids on the Tokyo area. Halsey was determined to sink {{the remnants of the}} IJN, and placed a particularly strong emphasis on attacking Nagato as she had been Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's flagship during the attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941. Due to the battleship's position within a well defended harbor, the Third Fleet's planners assessed that aircraft which attempted the straight and level flight needed to launch torpedoes against <b>her</b> <b>would</b> suffer heavy losses, and so decided to use dive bombing tactics instead. As the landward side of the naval base was mountainous, the approaches which could be used by dive bombers were limited.|$|E
5|$|RML ordered Magdalena in 1946. Her keel {{had been}} laid by 8 October when Harland and Wolff applied for a {{passenger}} certificate for the ship. In 1947 {{it was reported that}} delivery would be delayed until the end of 1948 and that the cost of building <b>her</b> <b>would</b> be considerably higher than the estimated cost when the order was placed. She was built to replace , which had been sunk in 1940. Magdalena was the first passenger ship built by Harland and Wolff in Belfast {{after the end of the}} war and the third-largest being built in the United Kingdom at that time.|$|E
5|$|Sabrina {{asked her}} friends {{not to discuss}} her past as she {{believed}} her humble beginnings, and Day's mistreatment of <b>her,</b> <b>would</b> tarnish her reputation. Anna Seward nevertheless wrote about Sabrina's upbringing in her 1804 work Memoirs on the Life of Dr. Darwin. As Seward publicly identified Sabrina in the book, it was criticised by the press, and Sabrina's son John was very angry to learn of his mother's past. In his 1820 memoirs, Edgeworth stated his belief that Sabrina and Day made a good match and that she loved him. Sabrina disagreed with these accounts, saying that Day had made her miserable, {{and that she had}} effectively been a slave.|$|E
50|$|On November 2, 2012, {{after more}} than eight years off-screen, it was {{announced}} that <b>Herring</b> <b>would</b> return to General Hospital as Lucy in December. She first aired on December 17.|$|R
25|$|When {{announcing the}} {{coalition}} agreement, Merkel {{stated that the}} main aim of <b>her</b> government <b>would</b> be to reduce unemployment, {{and that it was}} this issue on which <b>her</b> government <b>would</b> be judged.|$|R

5|$|The ruling dynasty of Greece (the House of Glücksburg) was of German-Danish origin, and Constantine and Sophia {{were seen}} as far too German by the Venizelists, but even though the {{marriage}} of the king to a Greek presented an opportunity to Hellenize the royal family, and counter criticisms {{that it was a}} foreign institution, both Venizelists and Constantinists opposed the match. The Venizelists feared it would give Alexander a means to communicate with his exiled family through Colonel Manos and both sides of the political divide were unhappy at the king marrying a commoner. Although Venizelos was a friend of Petros Manos, the prime minister warned the king that marrying <b>her</b> <b>would</b> be unpopular {{in the eyes of the}} people.|$|E
5|$|Marlene (Merle Dandridge) is {{the leader}} of the Fireflies, a militia {{movement}} hoping to wrest control of the Quarantine Zones from the military. She was tasked by Ellie's mother, a close friend of hers, to look out for her daughter, but Ellie only met her after her infection. After being wounded in Boston, she offers to sell Joel and Tess the merchandise Robert stole from them and sold to her in return for smuggling Ellie out of the Quarantine Zone. Joel meets Marlene again at the Firefly hospital in Salt Lake City, where scientists are running tests on Ellie. Marlene reveals that they will operate on Ellie, which will result in her death; Joel disagrees with the operation and fights back. After Joel rescues Ellie, Marlene tries to stop him from leaving, insisting that taking Ellie will merely delay her death until a more gruesome one occurs, and Ellie's return to <b>her</b> <b>would</b> help to create a cure against the infection. Joel disregards her and instead shoots her in the stomach. She begs for her life, but Joel executes her with a shot to the head, ensuring that no-one is left to come after them.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Graham, the Master of the Mint, in 1859 persuaded William Gladstone, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, {{that the}} state of the copper {{currency}} demanded a lighter, more durable replacement. Bronze was selected as harder and less subject to oxidation. It was a material with which the Mint had experience, having recently struck bronze coins for the Canadian colonies, and it had been used in France since 1852. Parliament passed legislation in 1860 that allowed the penny to be struck from an alloy of metals. The act required that Britannia appear on the coin, as the design was felt to symbolise Britain as ruler of the waves, and to omit <b>her</b> <b>would</b> be seen as abandoning that role. The Mint in 1860 awarded a contract for 1,720 tonnes of bronze pennies, halfpennies and farthings to James Watt & Co of Birmingham, a contract that would not be completed until 1863. Heaton's was also called upon to supply dies and coins, especially as Watt's prepared to execute its huge contract.|$|E
25|$|Some sources {{claim that}} Campbell was {{abducted}} in 1759 {{at the age}} of twelve years. If so, <b>her</b> birth <b>would</b> have been in 1747, and <b>her</b> repatriation <b>would</b> have occurred at around 17 years of age.|$|R
50|$|The Chinese houseboy, married 25- or 27-year-old Wong Foon Sing, became {{infatuated}} with Smith, giving her presents {{such as a}} silk nightdress. Although <b>her</b> friends <b>would</b> later testify that she feared him, <b>her</b> diary <b>would</b> reveal that she enjoyed attracting men.|$|R
50|$|They had {{to raise}} funds for the {{improvements}} themselves. Charles infamously sold one of his mothers favorite riding horses. It was sadly missed by <b>her,</b> it <b>would</b> still recognise <b>her</b> and <b>would</b> come towards the roadside as she passed by.|$|R

25|$|Jim Rockford's {{mother is}} never shown or named, {{and is very}} seldom {{referred}} to. Although never directly stated, the way Jim and Rocky talk about <b>her</b> <b>would</b> seem to indicate she had died (before the series' start).|$|E
25|$|To {{take her}} revenge from the Twelve Sisters, Santhumala, the {{favorite}} queen, feigned sickness {{and the king}} became worried. She told the king {{that the cause of}} her disease was the ill-treatment of the twelve other wives {{and the only thing that}} would heal <b>her</b> <b>would</b> be a medicine distilled from the eyes of the Twelve Sisters.|$|E

60|$|She {{said little}} to that, except that, she said, she <b>would</b> give <b>her</b> as little trouble as possible; {{but she was}} afraid she should {{sometimes}} be uneasy to her, which she hoped she would excuse. My Quaker told <b>her</b> she <b>would</b> much rather excuse <b>her</b> if she <b>would</b> forbear; for that if she <b>would</b> believe <b>her,</b> she <b>would</b> assure <b>her</b> she should never get any intelligence of me by her.|$|R
50|$|A New York Times article {{reported}} that Desoer announced her retirement in February 2012.

25|$|In those days, {{the tragic}} {{shipwreck}} of the Dictator (and the resulting loss of life) {{was not an}} unusual event for the local citizenry in this northernmost area of the Graveyard of the Atlantic. The treacherous waters in the area extend south along the North Carolina coast and had claimed many hundreds of vessels. However, as an impromptu memorial was erected shortly thereafter, {{the story of the}} Dictator and the souls aboard <b>her</b> <b>would</b> become part of both local tradition and legend in coastal Princess Anne County and Virginia Beach.|$|E
25|$|Miranda was {{encouraged}} by the U.S. government as part of Roosevelt's Good Neighbor policy, designed to strengthen ties with Latin America. It was believed that performers like <b>her</b> <b>would</b> give the policy a favorable impression with the American public. Miranda's contract with 20th Century Fox lasted from 1941 to 1946, shortly after the creation (in 1940) of the Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs. The goal of the OCIAA, based in Rio de Janeiro, was to obtain support from Latin American society and its governments for the United States.|$|E
25|$|The Journals of Ayn Rand, {{published}} in 1997 based on notes left after her death, preserve {{a list of}} detailed questions which Rand put to Lyles about the company's administrative structure and its practices in various situations and conditions. Later notes in the same journals show that Rand assigned to various characters in her book administrative titles in the book's fictional railway company, modeled on those in the Santa Fe Railway, and adjusted the actions which they are depicted as taking in various situations {{on the basis of}} what Lyles told <b>her</b> <b>would</b> be plausible acts for railway executives in similar situations.|$|E

25|$|According to one tradition, {{before meeting}} his patron Hajji Zayn al-Attar, Hafez {{had been working}} in a bakery, {{delivering}} bread to a wealthy quarter of the town. There, he first saw Shakh-e Nabat, a woman of great beauty, to whom some of his poems are addressed. Ravished by her beauty but knowing that his love for <b>her</b> <b>would</b> not be requited, he allegedly held his first mystic vigil in his desire to realize this union. Still, he encountered a being of surpassing beauty who identified himself as an angel, and his further attempts at union became mystic; a pursuit of spiritual union with the divine. A Western parallel is that of Dante and Beatrice.|$|E
25|$|When {{the reading}} {{audience}} of superhero comic books became predominately young {{boys in the}} mid to late 1950s, the focus of Superman stories shifted toward science fiction inspired plots involving extraterrestrials, fantasy creatures, and bizarre plots. Lois' main interests in various late 1950s and 1960s stories became vying with her rival Lana Lang for Superman's affections, attempting to prove Clark Kent and Superman were one and the same or otherwise getting Superman into marriage. Superman's rationale for resisting her matrimonial desires was that marrying <b>her</b> <b>would</b> put her in increased danger from his enemies and that she could not keep his secret identity hidden. Regardless, Lois married several times in the Superman stories of this era, including to Superman imposter from Kandor, the villainous Zak-Kul and a man from the future. All these marriages were either annulled or otherwise forgotten.|$|E
25|$|With her {{accession}} to power, Messalina enters history {{with a reputation}} as ruthless, predatory and sexually insatiable. Her husband is represented as easily led by her and unconscious of her many adulteries. In 48 AD, he went away on a trip and was informed when he returned that Messalina had {{gone so far as}} to marry her latest lover, Senator Gaius Silius. While many would have ordered her death, the Emperor offered her another chance. Seeing that as weakness, one of his head officers went behind the Emperor's back and ordered Messalina's death. Upon hearing the news, the Emperor did not react and simply asked for another chalice of wine. The Roman Senate then ordered a damnatio memoriae so that Messalina's name would be removed from all public and private places and all statues of <b>her</b> <b>would</b> be taken down.|$|E
50|$|As {{early as}} the 1930s Anaïs Nin had sought to have the diary published. Due to its size (in 1966, the diary {{contained}} more than 15,000 typewritten pages in some 150 volumes) and literary style, she would not find a publisher until 1966, when {{the first volume of}} <b>her</b> diary <b>would</b> be published, covering the years 1931-1934 in her life. The published version of <b>her</b> diary <b>would</b> be very popular among young women, making Anaïs Nin a feminist icon in the 1960s. Six more volumes of <b>her</b> diary <b>would</b> follow.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the first}} reading ( [...] , aliyah), Moses told {{the heads of}} the Israelite tribes God's {{commands}} about commitments ( [...] , nedarim, commonly translated, or some say mistranslated, as [...] "vows"). If a man made a vow to God, he was to carry out all that he promised. If a girl living in her father's household made a vow to God, and her father learned of it and did not object, <b>her</b> vow <b>would</b> stand. But if her father objected on the day that he learned of it, <b>her</b> vow <b>would</b> not stand, and God <b>would</b> forgive <b>her.</b> If she married while her vow was still in force, and her husband learned of it and did not object on the day that he found out, <b>her</b> vow <b>would</b> stand. But if her husband objected on the day that he learned of it, <b>her</b> vow <b>would</b> not stand, and God <b>would</b> forgive <b>her.</b> The vow of a widow or divorced woman was binding. If a married woman made a vow and her husband learned of it and did not object, then <b>her</b> vow <b>would</b> stand. But if her husband objected on the day that he learned of it, <b>her</b> vow <b>would</b> not stand, and God <b>would</b> forgive <b>her.</b> If her husband annulled one of her vows after the day that he learned of it, he <b>would</b> bear <b>her</b> guilt.|$|R
