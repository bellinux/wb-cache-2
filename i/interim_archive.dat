40|$|This study {{focuses on}} how wave–current and wave–turbulence {{interactions}} modify {{the transport of}} buoyant particles in the ocean. Here the particles can represent oil droplets, plastic particles, or plankton such as fish eggs and larvae. Using the General Ocean Turbulence Model (GOTM), modified to take surface wave effects into account, we investigate how the increased mixing by wave breaking and Stokes shear production, {{as well as the}} stronger veering by the Coriolis–Stokes force, affects the drift of the particles. The energy and momentum fluxes, as well as the Stokes drift, depend on the directional wave spectrum obtained from a wave model. As a first test, the depth and velocity scales from the model are compared with analytical solutions based on a constant eddy viscosity (i. e., classical Ekman theory). Secondly, the model is applied to a case in which we investigate the oil drift after an oil spill off the west coast of Norway in 2007. During this accident the average net drift of oil was observed to be both slower and more deflected away from the wind direction than predicted by oil-drift models. In this case, using wind and wave forcing from the ERA <b>Interim</b> <b>archive</b> it is shown that the wave effects are important for the resultant drift and have the potential to improve drift forecasting...|$|E
40|$|To view {{slides and}} audio follow this link: [URL] the rare books vault in Manuscripts, Archives, and Special Collections of Terrell Library {{there is an}} {{extremely}} rare set of Civil War portrait books purchased by WSU in the early 1940 ’s. What makes {{each one of these}} books so special is there were only six copies ever made and each volume cost around $ 200 a-piece. This 28 -volume set of Historical Portraits is a terrific source for locating photographs of leading Americans of the early Civil War era and they even cry out “open me” said Trevor James Bond, <b>Interim</b> Head, Manuscripts, <b>Archives,</b> and Special Collections of Terrell Library. What makes these books so important is that President Holland ordered the books before he had the funds to pay for them. To raise money Holland created an organization that would send out a letter asking for donation along with a portrait of Abraham Lincoln to 204 banks in Washington State. The resulting gifts totaled more than $ 9, 000. To ensure that the Library received the entire set, Holland purchased four of the volumes and donated them to the library. People are welcome to view the Historical Portraits {{or any of the other}} collections in weekdays between 8 : 30 a. m. and 4 : 30 p. m. To take a photo tour of some of the Historical Portraits, with comments from Trevor James Bond, <b>Interim</b> Head, Manuscripts, <b>Archives,</b> and Special Collections of Terrell Library, click on the following: [URL]...|$|R
40|$|One {{of the key}} {{challenges}} facing a knowledge-based organization is how to effectively transfer knowledge from individuals to other workers, thereby increasing benefit for the organization. For organizations in challenging environments this process, termed "knowledge management", can be a critical determinant of survival. This project studies knowledge management in the NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement, a UK public sector organization operating in a difficult and unstable environment. It focuses on the management of interim knowledge, used here both for information and knowledge created during a project but not incorporated into the product or other output, and for knowledge generated day-to-day which comprises the evidence base underpinning a product. Failure to retain interim knowledge in a usable form is being increasingly recognised as an important and inadequately-addressed area of risk for this organization. The investigation used thematic analysis of interviews with knowledge workers and corporate stakeholders {{before and after the}} introduction of Microsoft OneNote 2007, a software application which enables users to organize, collate and store information and knowledge in "notebooks". It also explores ways in which this application can meet corporate objectives of making knowledge more widely available and accessible to other workers. The study found {{the most important factor in}} access to knowledge by these workers is human signposting, both directly and by creating a context for accessing other sources of information. It highlighted weaknesses in handling and <b>archiving</b> <b>interim</b> knowledge. OneNote proved popular and useful to knowledge workers, and was robust and trouble-free in operation. It met some corporate objectives by improving day-to-day knowledge capture and organization, and is highly likely to improve archive quality. Recursive re-organization of information emerged as a key mechanism in effectively using OneNote; suggesting that mechanisms to enhance corporate usefulness, such as using standard notebook templates, may impede the process of knowledge creation. The findings are discussed in the context of other elements of the organization's knowledge management framework, such as its Work Process Methodology...|$|R
