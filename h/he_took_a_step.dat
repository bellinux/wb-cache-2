5|$|McAllister {{started his}} career with Eastleigh as a youth player. He moved to Basingstoke Town {{towards the end of}} 2001–02, making his debut in March 2002. McAllister spent three seasons there, making 113 appearances, scoring 66 goals before moving up the {{national}} league system to Conference National club Stevenage Borough where he made 10 appearances, having loan spells at Gravesend & Northfleet and Eastleigh in 2004–05. He joined Woking in 2005, spending two full seasons there, and making over 100 appearances. He had a short spell with Grays Athletic, being sent out on loan to Rushden & Diamonds and then another short spell at Oxford United, all during 2007–08. After leaving Oxford in 2008, <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> up to the Football League {{for the first time in}} his career, signing for Exeter City. He went on to score seven goals in his first season, but was loaned out to Barnet and Rotherham United in his second and was eventually released by the club in May 2010. McAllister then dropped back down to non-League football, joining Crawley Town where he played at Old Trafford; his team was defeated 1–0 by Manchester United in their FA Cup fifth round tie. He rejected a new contract from Crawley at the end of the 2010–11, subsequently joining Newport County.|$|E
25|$|Despite his inexperience, Rahman had obvious natural boxing {{skills that}} {{propelled}} him to 11 knockout wins {{in his first}} 12 fights. Then <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> up in class in March 1996 with a 10-round decision win over veteran Ross Puritty and seven months later, he repeated the feat against former world champion Trevor Berbick.|$|E
500|$|Statistically, Kilner's peak as a bowler {{came in the}} 1923 season, when he took 158 wickets at {{an average}} of 12.90 and {{finished}} second in the Yorkshire averages. With the bat, he failed to score a hundred {{for the first time since}} 1912, but still made 1,401 runs at 34.17 and including nine scores over fifty. This placed him third in the Yorkshire batting averages, his contributions helping his team to retain the County Championship. He made a very effective start to the season, taking 27 wickets in the first four matches for just 157 runs, including the best figures of his career, eight for 26 against Glamorgan, and six for 14 against Middlesex. [...] Later that season against Surrey, he performed what was regarded by Wisden as one of his best bowling feats. Surrey needed 184 runs to win and seemed certain winners when they had scored 127 for two. After Emmott Robinson took a wicket, Kilner took the last five for only 15 runs in a match-winning performance. He finished with bowling figures of six for 22 and took ten wickets in the match. He had been under the impression that Surrey had only needed seven runs (rather than the 27 they required) to win at the end, and his team-mates remembered he was pale with effort and concentration. In the same season, Kilner was picked for the Gentlemen v Players match at Lord's Cricket Ground, the most prestigious such fixture at the time, where he scored eight in his only innings and took three wickets. Wisden commented that he seemed certain to be picked for the England Test match side shortly (there were no Tests played that summer). <b>He</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> towards this when he was selected for a Test trial match, scoring 26 and 11 not out, but only bowling 18 overs in the match to take two wickets. He also made another appearance for the Players, this time at Scarborough. His performances in the season earned him selection as one of Wisden's Bowlers of the Year.|$|E

He was second highest scorer in the tournament behind India's Tanmay Srivastava.

2500|$|In an interview, Carranza {{described}} the recording process for The Bedlam in Goliath stating {{that no more}} than three takes an hour were recorded, as a way to soak in what was recorded and to hear the differences, which in turn improved the general mood and atmosphere of the album's creation. Elaborating on the method, Carranza stated that [...] "when van Gogh was around he wasn't just painting, painting, painting. I'm sure <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back once in a while.

2500|$|All {{the while}} Merezhkovsky {{was trying to}} {{convince}} Mussolini {{that it was the}} latter's mission to start the [...] "Holy War against Russia" [...] (the idea formed the basis of his article [...] "Meeting Mussolini", published by Illustrated Russia in February 1937). Seeing his name frequently mentioned by the Italian press in connection with bizarre Merezhkovsky's suggestions made duce uneasy and <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> back. Visiting Rome in summer 1937, Merezhkovsky had talks with the Italian Foreign minister, but failed to meet Mussolini. Then came the disillusionment, and in October of the same year he was already speaking of how disappointed he was with the Italian leader's [...] "petty materialism." [...] He tried to contact General Francisco Franco, now seeing Spain as the last anti-Communist citadel of Europe and failed. Thus Merezhkovsky's choice of the new European [...] "heroes" [...] narrowed down to Adolf Hitler.|$|E

2500|$|Harald Høffding {{wrote an}} article about him in A brief history of modern {{philosophy}} (1900). Høffding mentioned Kierkegaard in Philosophy of Religion 1906, and the American Journal of Theology (1908) printed an article about Hoffding's Philosophy of Religion. Then Høffding repented of his previous convictions in The problems of philosophy (1913). Høffding was also {{a friend of the}} American philosopher William James, and although James had not read Kierkegaard's works, as they were not yet translated into English, he attended the lectures about Kierkegaard by Høffding and agreed with much of those lectures. James' favorite quote from Kierkegaard came from Høffding: [...] "We live forwards but we understand backwards". William James wrote:"We live forward, we understand backward, said a Danish writer; and to understand life by concepts is to arrest its movement, cutting it up into bits as if with scissors, and, immobilizing these in our logical [...] where, comparing them as dried specimens, we can ascertain which of them statically includes or excludes which other. This treatment supposes life to have already accomplished itself, for the concepts, being so many views taken after the fact, are retrospective and post mortem. Nevertheless, we can draw conclusions from them and project them into the future. We cannot learn from them how life made itself go, or how it will make itself go; but, on the supposition that its ways of making itself go are unchanging, we can calculate what positions of imagined arrest it will exhibit hereafter under given conditions." [...] William James, A Pluralistic Universe, 1909, p. 244 Kierkegaard wrote of moving forward past the irresolute good intention:The yes of the promise is sleep-inducing, but the no, spoken and therefore audible to oneself, is awakening, and repentance is usually not far away. The one who says, [...] "I will, sir," [...] is at the same moment pleased with himself; the one who says no becomes almost afraid of himself. But this difference if very significant in the first moment and very decisive in the next moment; yet if the first moment is the judgment of the momentary, the second moment is the judgment of eternity. This is precisely why the world is so inclined to promises, inasmuch as the world is the momentary, and at the moment a promise looks very good. This is why eternity is suspicious of promises, just as it is suspicious of everything momentary. And so it is also with the one who, rich in good intentions and quick to promise, moves backward further and further away from the good. By means of the intention and the promise, he is facing {{in the direction of the}} good, is turned toward the good but is moving backward further and further away from it. With every renewed intention and promise it looks as if <b>he</b> <b>took</b> <b>a</b> <b>step</b> forward, and yet he is not merely standing still, but he is actually taking a step backward. The intention taken in vain, the unfulfilled promise, leaves despondency, dejection, that in turn perhaps soon blazes up into an even more vehement intention, which leaves only greater listlessness. Just as the alcoholic continually needs a stronger and stronger stimulant-in order to become intoxicated, likewise the one who has become addicted to promises and good intentions continually needs more and more stimulation-in order to go backward.
