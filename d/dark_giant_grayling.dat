60|$|One of the {{new friends}} who went out there with me was a large man, and I had been admiring his size all the way. I was still admiring it as he stood by the {{governor}} on the veranda, talking; then the Fijian butler stepped out there to announce tea, and dwarfed him. Maybe he did not quite dwarf him, but at any rate the contrast was quite striking. Perhaps that <b>dark</b> <b>giant</b> was a king in a condition of political suspension. I {{think that in the}} talk there on the veranda it was said that in Fiji, as in the Sandwich Islands, native kings and chiefs are of much grander size and build than the commoners. This man was clothed in flowing white vestments, and they were just the thing for him; they comported well with his great stature and his kingly port and dignity. European clothes would have degraded him and made him commonplace. I know that, because they do that with everybody that wears them.|$|R
60|$|Vineyards {{and deep}} meadows, islanded and framed with thicket, gave place {{more and more}} as we ascended to woods of oak and madrona, dotted with {{enormous}} pines.

Thence, looking up and from however far, each fir stands separate against the sky no bigger than an eyelash; and all together lend a quaint, fringed aspect to the hills. The oak is no baby; even the madrona, upon these spurs of Mount Saint Helena, comes to a fine bulk and ranks with forest trees--but the pines look down upon the rest for underwood. As Mount Saint Helena among her foothills, so these <b>dark</b> <b>giants</b> out- top their fellow-vegetables. Alas! if they had left the redwoods, the pines, in turn, would have been dwarfed. But the redwoods, fallen from their high estate, are serving as family bedsteads, or yet more humbly as field fences, along all Napa Valley.|$|R

Facing Camearra in his partially restored light form, Tiga {{was on the verge of}} defeat until Rena appeared and provided assistance. When shielding Rena from Camearra's attack, this fully restored his light form but his actions of saving Rena (which is a sign of genuine love) had made Camearra even outraged and she turned into Demonthor, killing Tiga with relative ease until the remains of ancient giants revived him into Glitter Tiga to finish the monster. Although Daigo had returned to his normal life, what happened to Tiga is unknown as of his Dark Spark Lence was either retained or lost in a similar fashion to the original.|$|R

40|$|The early {{events of}} macrocyst {{development}} in Dictyostelium discoideum {{have been investigated}} using a new culturing system.

Although these giant cells have been assumed to be {{the products of the}} fusion of opposite mating-type cells, no experimental evidence to prove this assump-tion has been obtained using such mixed-culture systems. In order to avoid the complexities invol-ved in mixed-culturing, we have developed a new system involving the separate culture, and later mixing, of opposite mating-type cells. This has enabled us to obtain direct evidence that giant cells are produced by fusion between opposite mating-type cells. Cell fusion occurs immediately after mixing and is completed within 30 min. As a number of cells fuse simultaneously, giant cells produced by this method are very large multinucleated cells, and not binucleated zygptes. Using this system we also discovered the following facts related to giant cell formation: (1) cells can acquire their fusion competence without the presence of cells of the opposite mating-type; (2) only HM 1 cells require darkness to acquire their fusion competence; (3) the restrictive temperature, 25 °C, inhibits the induction of fusion competence in HM 1 cells, but not in NC 4 cells...|$|R

He had also lost the ability to become Mephisto, but when the Unknown Hand sends down Dark Mephisto Zwei against Junis Blue, Mizorogi gets his chance at redemption, transforming by force of will back to Mephisto, and holds Zwei down so that Nexus can destroy him.
