5000|$|In 1948, Malcolm Nokes {{investigated}} siphons {{working in}} both air pressure {{and in a}} partial vacuum, for siphons in vacuum he concluded that: [...] "The gravitational force on the column of liquid in the <b>downtake</b> tube less the gravitational force in the uptake tube causes the liquid to move. The liquid is therefore in tension and sustains a longitudinal strain which, {{in the absence of}} disturbing factors, is insufficient to break the column of liquid". But for siphons of small uptake height working at atmospheric pressure, he concluded that: [...] "... the tension of the liquid column is neutralized and reversed by the compressive effect of the atmosphere on the opposite ends of the liquid column." ...|$|E
2500|$|The first steel for {{the first}} three of eight Royal Navy ships was cut on 20 July 2017. BAE Systems {{announced}} the award of the Type 26's first seven equipment manufacturing contracts in July 2015, these worth in excess of £170 million. Contracts were awarded to Babcock for the ship’s air weapons handling system; David Brown Gear Systems Ltd for the propulsion gearbox and the test facility; GE Power Conversion for the electric propulsion motor and drive system [...] and testing facility; Raytheon Anschütz for the integrated navigation and bridge system including customer-specific design and development, a land-based integration facility, and a wide range of services; Rolls Royce Power Engineering for the gas turbine; Rohde & Schwarz UK Ltd for the communications systems; WR Davis of Canada for the uptakes and <b>downtakes</b> of the ship's funnel and exhaust system.|$|R
500|$|Instead of {{a single}} island {{superstructure}} containing both the ship's navigation bridge and flying control (flyco) centres, the ships will have these operations divided between two structures, with the forward island for navigating the ship and the aft island for controlling flying operations. The primary reason for having twin islands was to space out the funnels, as the ships were designed with redundancy with [...] "duplicated main and secondary machinery in two complexes with independent uptakes and <b>downtakes</b> {{in each of the}} two islands", while the alternative of consolidating all the exhaust trunkings would have reduced hangar space as well as being a flooding vulnerability. There are also additional benefits to having separate islands rather than a single large island, such as easier construction, reduced wind turbulence, and freed up deck space. Using two structures provides separate mountings for the air surveillance radar (forward) from interfering with the medium range radar (aft); furthermore visibility is improved for both navigation and landing operations.|$|R
