500|$|Cameron {{felt the}} Titanic sinking was [...] "like a great novel that really happened", {{but that the}} event had become a mere {{morality}} tale; the film would give audiences the experience of living the history. The treasure hunter Brock Lovett represented those who never connected with the human element of the tragedy, while the blossoming romance of Jack and Rose, Cameron believed, {{would be the most}} engaging part of the story: when their love is finally destroyed, the audience would mourn the loss. He said: [...] "All my films are love stories, but in Titanic <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> the balance right. It's not a disaster film.

Hubbard stated in another lecture that he had been posted aboard [...] "corvettes, North Atlantic. And I went on fighting submarines in the North Atlantic and doing other things and so on.

500|$|Nichols {{was cast}} as Shana [...] "Scarlett" [...] O'Hara in the live-action film {{adaptation}} of the G.I. Joe franchise [...] (2009) in late 2007. She later said that she accepted director Stephen Sommers' offer for the role without having read the actual script. [...] "I'd heard from other people that the script was quite good. And then when <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> to read it myself... I really, really liked it... I liked {{that there were two}} kick-ass female roles. And I liked the fact that it wasn't just a big action movie... And there was comedy in it. I was genuinely really happily surprised when I read the script." [...] She put on approximately [...] of muscle for the role and trained in mixed martial arts with co-star Sienna Miller for some of the film's action sequences. Nichols was burned by a flame during the filming of a fight scene with Miller. Like The Amityville Horror, G.I. Joe: The Rise of Cobra was not well received by most critics, but performed well at the box office. Richard Corliss of Time wrote that Nichols had [...] "an appealing manner and comely biceps" [...] as Scarlett O'Hara and took notice of her [...] "savory girl fight with Sienna Miller, as the mostly villainous Baroness." [...] After G.I. Joe, Nichols' next project was the horror film For Sale by Owner, where she played Anna Farrier. Going straight-to-video on October 27, 2009, the movie went largely unnoticed by critics and audiences alike.|$|E
2500|$|I did batik at first, {{and then}} after doing that I learned {{more and more and}} then I changed over to {{painting}} for good...Then it was canvas.

I didn't want to continue with the hard work batik required – boiling the fabric over and over, lighting fires, and using up all the soap powder, over and over. That's why I gave up batik and changed over to canvas – it was easier. My eyesight deteriorated as I got older, and because of that I gave up batik on silk – it was better for me to just paint.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{continued}} {{this transformation}} with an unexpected cover of Joy Division's [...] "Love Will Tear Us Apart", which was released {{as a single}} in 1988 on Product Inc. in a confusing array of 7" [...] and 12" [...] inch formats. Both Gira and Jarboe sang lead vocals on {{different versions of the}} song. In later years Gira dismissed this release as a mistake, {{and for a long time}} refused to reissue his own vocal version, although Jarboe's version was re-released much sooner. However their version of the song was a hit on US college radio in 1988, which led to the group being offered a major label deal at Uni/MCA. [...] "I'd worked so hard all my life", said Gira. [...] "At 15, I was digging ditches in the desert in Israel, and I put myself through college painting houses. I never saw any money from any of our records.

2500|$|Givens pitched {{for five}} more {{seasons in the}} majors—in 1996, when he went 3-1 with a 2.86 earned-run average in four games. [...] He had begun the season on a 30-day {{rehabilitation}} assignment with New Orleans after injuring his back in his final throwing session at home in Aurora, Colorado {{the day before he}} left for 1996 spring training. [...] After his 30-day rehab assignment, Givens unexpectedly ended up staying longer in AAA instead of being promoted to the major leagues. [...] "I was chapped at the time", Givens said of his frustration with not being called up sooner in 1996. [...] "I didn't pitch well the first few games, then <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> my head on straight." [...] Givens was called up in June and was hit hard in four starts. [...] While at New Orleans in 1996, however, Givens pitched well, going 10–9 with a 3.02 earned-run average. [...] He filed for free agency on October 15, 1996, after he and the Brewers decided to part ways by mutual agreement.|$|E
2500|$|... "Everyone Will Die" [...] ("a {{celebration of}} life, not {{necessarily}} a death song," [...] said Pierre) was first recorded as a scratch demo on the band's tour bus, and the original vocal track from that recording was kept for the album version, as it represented the emotion the band were striving for. A string section was employed for the bridge. [...] "Having real strings was like {{a dream come true}} for me. I've always wanted to arrange parts, and <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> to," [...] said Taylor. [...] "The Coma Kid" [...] relates to procrastination: [...] "The Coma Kid...somebody who's unable to 'do.' Somebody who's thinking of 'doing,' but not actually 'doing.'" [...] The song was described as a throwback of sorts to [...] "Modern Chemistry", a track from the band's debut, I Am The Movie. [...] "Boxelder" [...] was written uniquely, in an attempt to break songwriting routine; as a result, the song switches between time signatures, going from seven to four-four during the chorus. [...] "A boxelder needs the tree to live, because they infest the trees, but for them to live they end up killing the tree, and [...] relates that to a relationship, which I think is very interesting," [...] said Johnson. [...] "The Worst Is Yet to Come" [...] dates as far back as 2009, and was recorded in the span of one day. Tony Thaxton was not involved in the initial writing due to an arm infection, which also was an issue in the recording process of My Dinosaur Life. Because of his absence, Claudio Rivera of Saves the Day stood in as the drummer for the original demo; Thaxton's drum part was developed later and is present on the album. Likewise, [...] "Bad Ideas" [...] is the oldest song on the album, first attempted during sessions for 2005's Commit This to Memory.|$|E
2500|$|Salli Frattini, the {{executive}} producer for MTV who had planned the entire performance, recalled {{a phone call from}} the officiating booth that was her first indication something had gone wrong. Frattini was in a truck outside of Reliant Stadium celebrating the end of the 12-minute halftime performance, which they initially thought was a success. [...] "We were like, 'Uh, we’re playing that back right now'", Frattini said. [...] "There was lots of chaos in the truck, and we played it back and we were like, 'Oh, s. What just happened?'" [...] Alex Coletti, another MTV producer, said he could not find Jackson after the performance. [...] "I tried to get in touch to make sure she was okay", he said. [...] "Her entire camp stopped answering the phones. <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> to her tour manager, and they were already at the airport." [...] Coletti assumed the singer was so mortified that she fled immediately, though later assumed the incident was a possible [...] "set up", adding it was the last time he had spoken to her. Coletti's assumption is potentially another reason for Jackson's blacklisting on MTV in addition to other music channels and radio formats. An MTV representative confirmed the costume tear was conceptualized by the MTV staff, in which the show's producers mockingly ripped their clothing in response to Timberlake's closing lyric during rehearsals. This led to Jackson and Timberlake improvising the move, in which Timberlake tore off Jackson's kilt. Frattini stated, [...] "When we did the original rehearsal, there was conversation about a fake skirt she would wear, and that Justin would actually pull open the skirt and take off the skirt. In rehearsal, they actually tried to rip open the skirt, which kind of went with the lyrics of the song". The production team then discussed another option, which led to the costume tearing, although the outfit was intended to stay in place.|$|E

2500|$|At the 1985 French Open, Evert {{would play}} her {{antagonist}} in Navratilova {{in the final}} {{for the third time}} here in Paris at Roland Garros. [...] In the first set, Evert would take the first three games, which Evert held her serve steady, and she broke Navratilova during the second game. [...] Evert would lose her serve in the fifth game of the set that gave her opponent a chance to level the set at three games-all, and she did just that. [...] To wrap up the set, Evert would rally off the next three games to take the set six games to three, breaking Navratilova in the eight game. [...] In the second set, it would be rather competitive with many ebbs and flows, even more so than the first set. [...] Evert would hold serve in the second set all the way until the eighth game, which Navratilova broke her serve to get back on serve, and would hold in the ninth game to take a five games to four advantage. [...] This set was still in doubt because both could not manage to hold serves and in the eleventh and twelfth games both would take turns in breaking each other's serves. [...] This sent the second set to a tiebreaker, which Navratilova would roar out of the gates with a four to one points advantage, and Evert could not manage {{to get back in the}} breaker that ended seven points to four. [...] In the 52 minute third set, Evert would storm out to a three games to love advantage, but knowing Navratilova, Evert found herself in a tumultuous battle for the title because her opponent would break back to level the set three games-all. [...] Evert managed to stave off a crucial break point opportunity in the seventh game of the set, when Navratilova guided her forehand into the net, and the score went to four game to three. [...] Evert broke Navratilova in the eighth game of the set, which allowed Evert to serve for the match at five games to three. [...] Evert would be incapable to serve out the match during the ninth game, which Navratilova broke, so this made the score five games to four. [...] In addition, Evert would serve twice for the match, but was broken at 15 and love in those games. [...] This failure to convert would cost Evert some grief by having in the eleventh game, which was because she got down love-40 on serve. [...] It took some fantastic shot making in order to divert having to break to stay in the match, which it a twist-of-fate Evert would break her opponent in the subsequent game to take the lead at six games to five. [...] Evert serving for the match at 30-all hit a winner crosscourt, and at match point went down the line, which then the championships was hers after a two-hour and 52 minute final tussle of the clash-of-the-tennis-titans. [...] Evert said [...] "when I hit the last winner down the line I was really proud of myself...I never gave up and when <b>I</b> <b>finally</b> <b>got</b> to match point I went for a winner and I hit it. I had held my emotions in for so long that I really kind of let go." [...] This title was her sixth French Open title and 17th slam for her career.|$|E
