E85 fuels were rejected by NASCAR and the <b>dubiousness</b> <b>of</b> promotional claims about them have limited their appeal. Other demands were largely rejected, as they reflected an unrealistic view of racing as a technology exercise despite decades of banning of technological items throughout motorsports such as Wankel engines, turbines (used at Indianapolis in the 1960s), and traction control, as well as the continued effectiveness (and relative ease of policing) of NASCAR's antiquated carburation and pushrod technology.|$|R

Bryant remained a strong exporter overall, though, with exports to many European and Asian countries. But continued trade with the Soviet Union would increasingly prompt contention.

In this essay, I argue that crazyism is true of the metaphysics of mind. A position is “crazy ” in the intended sense if it is contrary to common sense and we are not epistemically compelled to believe it. Crazyism about the metaphysics of mind can thus be treated as the conjunction of two sub-theses: (1.) that something contrary to common sense must be among the core truths of the metaphysics of mind and (2.) that whatever that true thing is, we are not epistemically compelled to believe it. I defend the first thesis on grounds of the probable incoherence of folk metaphysics, from which follows that any fully fleshed-out metaphysics will inevitably conflict with some piece of that incoherent story. I defend the second thesis on three grounds: peer disagreement, lack of a compelling method for resolving metaphysical disputes about the mind, and the <b>dubiousness</b> <b>of</b> the general cosmological claims with which metaphysical claims about the mind are entangled...|$|R

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of the speech of the extinct Tasmanian Aborigines seems at first almost impossible, owing to the paucity and <b>dubiousness</b> <b>of</b> the records we possess; but after careful research we find that, though the records are scanty, yet they are fairly ample, considering the comparatively small number of the constituent parts of the language, and a reasonable degree of probability can be attained by a patient study of the material available.

Practically all the available material is contained in H. Ling Roth's work, "The Aborigines of Tasmania" (Halifax, 1899), supplemented by H.

40|$|The {{concept of}} free will is a {{problematic}} basis for assessing legal accountability. First of all, free will could never have evolved {{in a world of}} ordinary biological pressures. There is, moreover, substantial experimental evidence against it. This evidentiary situation is a serious moral concern because free will ideology {{plays a key role in}} justifying punishment in criminal law. People draw a sharp distinction between the suffering of innocents and suffering that is deserved. As a basis for criminal punishment, the very concept of just deserts usually presupposes that wrongdoers have a choice in what they do. The essay proceeds from the assumption that hurting people is presumptively wrong and therefore requires justification. If this assumption is true, then the factual <b>dubiousness</b> <b>of</b> free will presents a serious problem for current penal practices. Because the evidence makes free will unlikely and the logic of evolution makes it impossible, an important underpinning of the criminal law appears to fail. A variant {{of free will}}, so-called compatibilism, does not solve or avoid the problem of justification. To the contrary, it seems on closer analysis to be merely a repackaging of an ancient form of virtue-ethics under which people are deemed to deserve to suffer because they are what they are...|$|R

So the native guides refused to continue the venture, and then every body deserted except a stranger named Marlette.

We took one lantern and instructed the guides to hang the other to the roof of the look-out house to serve as a beacon for us in case we got lost, and then the party started back up the precipice and Marlette and I made our run. We skipped over the hot floor and over the red crevices with brisk dispatch and reached the cold lava safe but with pretty warm feet. Then we took things leisurely and comfortably, jumping tolerably wide and probably bottomless chasms, and threading our way through picturesque lava upheavals with considerable confidence. When we got fairly away from the cauldrons of boiling fire, we seemed to be in a gloomy desert, and a suffocatingly dark one, surrounded by dim walls that seemed to tower to the sky.

40|$|Genetic {{parameters}} for somatic cell score (SCS) in the Italian Holstein-Friesian population were estimated addressing {{the pattern of}} genetic correlation with protein yield in different parities (first, second, and third) and on different days in milk within each parity. Three approaches for parameter estimation were applied using random samples of herds from the national database of the Italian Holstein Association. Genetic correlations for lactation measures (305 -d protein yield and lactation SCS) were positive in the first parity (0. 31) and close to zero in the second (0. 01) and third (0. 09) parities. These results indicated that larger values of SCS were genetically associated with increased production. The second and third sets of estimates were based on random regression test-day models, modeling the shape of lactation curve with the Wilmink function and fourth-order Legendre polynomials, respectively. Genetic correlations from both random regression models showed a specific pattern associated with days in milk within and across parities. Estimates varied from positive to negative {{in the first and}} second parity, and from null to negative in the third parity. Patterns were similar for both random regression models. The average overall correlation between SCS and protein yield was zero or slightly positive in the first lactation and ranged from zero to negative in later lactations. Correlation estimates differed by parity and stage of lactation. They also demonstrated the <b>dubiousness</b> <b>of</b> applying a single genetic correlation measure between SCS and protein in setting selection strategies. Differences in magnitude and the sign of genetic correlations between SCS and yields across and within parities should be accounted for in selection schemes...|$|R
40|$|The Utility Theory, {{which forms}} the {{fundamental}} {{framework of a}} significant area of economic science devoted {{to the study of}} consumer behaviour, has always been met with objection and criticism from many economists and it continues to do so. The inability to quantify utility and the <b>dubiousness</b> <b>of</b> the comparative evaluation of different consumer combinations of goods continue to give rise to attempts to supplement, amend or improve the existing theory of supply and demand. Such attempts should be recognized as reasonable and necessary, as many people reading the extensive literature on the utility theory are certain that they are reading a psychology textbook. One of the possible alternatives of the utility theory is an attempt to view consumer behaviour {{in the same way as}} producer behaviour. In my opinion, dividing economic agents into consumers and producers is a grave error. This division is not only capable of raising a number of questions among students and specialists, but it could also give rise to such a psychological phenomenon as split personality. During working hours an entrepreneur attempts to obtain the maximum profit possible and in the evening in the shopping centre, he or she attempts to maximize utility. Furthermore, he or she will have to continuously solve a rather difficult task capable of putting many people in a dead-end situation: is the purchased item a normal consumer item or a means of production? What should be maximized: profit or utility? It is evident that the consumer behaviour theory continues to remain open to criticism and requires considerable amendments, which is the reason for this essay...|$|R

40|$|For many years, {{accounting}} discourse {{has been}} concerned with the <b>measurement</b> <b>of</b> attributes of accounting events. The concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> forms one <b>of</b> the central pillars on which the preparation of financial statements is based. For example, financial statements can only be prepared if economic events meet the definition of {{an element of the}} financial statements and have a cost or value that can be measured with reliability. This has created the belief that accounting practices are practices <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> The principles <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> require that every process <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> be based on an appropriate theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> Given the belief in the accounting discipline that accounting practices are synonymous with practices <b>of</b> <b>measurement,</b> it is to be assumed that acceptable theories <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> exist in the discipline. However, over the decades, researchers in this field have been unsuccessful in creating an acceptable theory <b>of</b> accounting <b>measurement.</b> This suggests that there is a gap between the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and the scientific principles <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> The main goals of this thesis are to determine whether the concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> in accounting is in harmony with the principles of the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and to develop a conceptual model <b>of</b> the accounting <b>measurement</b> problem. Representational theory establishes measurement in the social sciences. Accounting is regarded as a social science. This study applies the principles of the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> to determine the nature of the gap between the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and the principles of this theory. The very fact of referring to accounting as a measurement discipline implies the presence of an established and well-known theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> in that discipline: a discipline cannot be referred to as a measurement discipline without the existence of such a theory. Therefore, the lack of success of researchers in creating a theory <b>of</b> accounting <b>measurement</b> suggests that accounting is not a measurement discipline and that accountants are currently unaware of this. To test this hypothesis: 1. A critical literature analysis was conducted, investigating whether the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> is in harmony with the principles of the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> The results <b>of</b> this analysis indicated that the accounting concept <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> is not in harmony with the principles of the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement.</b> 2. A questionnaire was sent to accountants, testing whether they were familiar with the principles of the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> and their application to the accounting discipline. The results of the survey indicated that accountants are not familiar with the principles of the representational theory <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> or their application to the accounting discipline. The main contributions of this study lie in the fact that it reveals that current accounting practices are not in harmony with the principles <b>of</b> representational <b>measurement.</b> Accountants should be educated in the purpose of the principles <b>of</b> <b>measurement</b> in the social sciences in order to ensure their proper application during accounting measurement.
