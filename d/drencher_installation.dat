40|$|Purpose. This work {{represents}} {{further development}} of earlier received results of simulation of water curtains used as fire protection walls. Subject of the theoretical analysis is the flat fan sprays which flow from the slot-hole sprinkler. The central objective {{of the study is}} to develop calculation method of one of the main parameters of this mathematical model. It is such parameter as the equivalent diameter of droplets of the sprayed water stream. Earlier there was no such calculation procedure, and determination of this parameter was made by means of the difficult experimental measurements. Approach. In this study earlier published literary data are applied to calculation of this parameter. The formula received in the work allows carrying out calculation of called parameter on the basis of design characteristics of <b>drencher</b> <b>installation.</b> The graphic dependences constructed on the formula allowed defining dependence of the equivalent diameter of droplets of the sprayed stream on technical parameters. Findings. Application of this formula to earlier developed mathematical model of thermal shielding allowed expanding its opportunities for practical use. This model can be used for designing of water curtains of fire-prevention appointment, and also for definition of optimum modes of their operation. ???????????? ?????????? ???????? ????? ?????????? ??????????? ??????????????? ????????????? ??????? ????? ???????????????? ??????????. ????????? ?????????????? ??????? ???????? ??????? ????? ??????????? ????, ??????????? ???????? ??????????? ???????????. ???????? ????? ???????????? ???????? ???????? ?????? ??????? ?????? ?? ??????? ?????????? ?????? ? ?????????????? ???????? ?????? ????? ??????????? ????. ????? ??????????? ????? ????????? ???? ???????? ???? ? ??????? ??????? ????????????????? ?????????. ? ?????? ?????? ??? ??? ??????? ????????? ????? ?????????????? ???????????? ??????. ???????, ?????????? ? ??????, ????????? ????????? ?????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????? ?? ?????? ?????????????? ?????????? ?????????? ?????????. ??????????? ???????????, ?????????? ? ??????? ???????, ????????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ???????? ?????? ?? ??????????? ??????????. ?????????? ??????? ? ?????????????? ?????? ??????????? ????????? ????????? ?? ??????????? ??? ????????????? ??????????. ?????? ????? ?????????????? ??? ?????????????? ??????? ????? ???????????????? ??????????, ? ????? ??? ??????????? ??????????? ??????? ?? ??????????...|$|E
40|$|Purpose. Development of {{calculated}} {{techniques for}} thermal radiation shielding by a water curtain and performing numerical calculations of its transmittance for fire thermal radiation. Methodology. The central {{objective of the}} study is to develop calculation method of some major parameters of this mathematical model. These are such parameters: velocities of droplets moving, their concentration in space, thickness of equivalent layer of water, transmittance. Earlier there was no such calculation procedure, and determination of these parameters was made by means of the difficult experimental measurements. In this study the submerged jet theory is applied for calculation of these parameters. Subject of the theoretical analysis is the flat fan sprays which flow from the system of slot-hole sprinkler. The formulae received in the work allow to carry out calculation of called parameters on the basis of design characteristics of <b>drencher</b> <b>installation.</b> The graphic dependences constructed on the formulae allowed to define spatial distributions of these parameters. Findings. Calculated formulae for the axial velocity of the sprayed stream, for volume ratio of water, for thickness of equivalent layer of water, for a thermal radiation transmittance, which take into account the in homogeneity of a spatial distribution of droplets. Application of results. Determination of optimum parameters of water spray curtain for the thermal radiation attenuation during fire suppression. ????? ?? ???????? ?????????? ??????? ??????, ???????????? ????????????? ????????????? ????????? ????????? ??????, ???????? ?? ??????? ?????????????? ???? ????. ??? ??????? ?????? ???????? ? ??????????? ?? ??????????? ?? ?????????????? ?????????? ??????? ?????????? ? ?????? ?? ?????? ????????? ?????? ??????????? ?????. ? ?????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ????????????? ????? ?????????????? ?????? ????????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ????????. ??????????? ??????? ?????????????? ????????????????? ????????????? ?????? ?? ???????????? ???????? ??????? ????? ???????????????? ?????????? ? ????????? ????????? ??????? ??? ?? ???????? ??????? ??????...|$|E
