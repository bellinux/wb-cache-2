25|$|The third Ponce fire {{of large}} {{proportions}} occurred on January 25, 1899. The fire was fought {{by a group}} of firefighters amongst whom was Pedro Sabater and the civilian Rafael Rivera Esbrí, who would later become mayor of the city. The fire started at the U.S. Munitions Depot on the lot currently occupied by the Ponce High School building and grounds. The heroes in that fire, believed to have saved the city from certain annihilation, are remembered to this day with monuments on their tombs as well as in a monument in the city square Plaza Las Delicias. As a further gesture of gratitude, a neighborhood of distinctive Victorian-style cottages were constructed to house the firefighters and their families. These houses, painted in the red and black colors of the city, are located along a street named Calle 25 <b>de</b> <b>Enero</b> (25 <b>de</b> <b>Enero</b> street); they are still owned and occupied by the descendants of these firefighters and are a scenic attraction in Ponce's historic center.|$|E

25|$|Modern Spanish {{no longer}} uses the {{apostrophe}} to indicate elision in standard writing, {{although it can}} sometimes be found in older poetry for that purpose. Instead Spanish writes out the spoken elision in full (<b>de</b> <b>enero,</b> mi hijo) except for the contraction del for de + el, which uses no apostrophe. Spanish also switches to a form that {{is identical to the}} masculine article (but is actually a variant of the feminine article) immediately before a feminine noun beginning with a stressed a instead of writing (or saying) an elision: un águila blanca, el águila blanca, and el agua pura but una/la blanca águila and la pura agua. This reflects the origin of the Spanish definite articles from the Latin demonstratives ille/illa/illum.|$|E

The Ponce Fire Department also built the first fire station in the Island, which still stands to this day, and is now open as the Parque de Bombas museum. Also, in 1951, Ponce's Fire Chief Raúl Gándara-Cartagena, wrote a book on the firemen's service, which became a firemen's manual in several Latin American countries.

It was Baleztena and his friends who in 1911 first performed it remains debated whather the ritual was intended as a Carlist demonstration dogging the Liberal-dominated city council or simply as a juvenile joke. When it comes to running of the bulls he was in favor of as few regulations as possible, though none of the sources consulted mentions Baleztena running with the bulls himself. He remained one of key figures shaping sanfermines until the early 1960s, when he lost his grip on the event. The 1963-4 feasts were snatched by young Carlist progressists, who formatted them as their own political manifestations.|$|E

2500|$|On January 25, 1899, a large fire (later dubbed [...] "El Polvorin") {{threatened}} {{the lives of}} Ponceños, {{as well as the}} economy of Puerto Rico as a whole, given Ponce's de facto role as Puerto Rico's banking and agricultural capital. A painting inside Parque de Bombas commemorates the heroic acts of seven valiant [...] "bomberos" [...] and a civilian who fought bravely against the voracious fire that {{threatened the}} region. Disobeying orders from the American troops that had recently taken control of Puerto Rico, the group was able to appease flames that had started inside the U.S. Army’s gunpowder reserves. Due to their courageous efforts, disaster was narrowly averted. For their success, the group was honored many times both in Ponce and the rest of Puerto Rico. A few yards from Parque de Bombas, on Plaza Federico Degetau, sits an obelisk to their memory, and at the Cementerio Civil de Ponce (Ponce Civil Cemetery) a mausoleum was erected in 1911 to their memory where all seven heroes were eventually interred. Later on, the Parque de Bombas building was painted in Ponce's traditional city colors, red and black. A series of homes built a few years later for the firefighters and their families on 25 <b>de</b> <b>Enero</b> Street were also painted in these colors also.|$|E
2500|$|On 31 January 1980, a {{group of}} {{displaced}} K'iche' and Ixil peasant farmers occupied the Spanish Embassy in Guatemala City to protest the kidnapping and murder of peasants in Uspantán by elements of the Guatemalan Army. In the subsequent police raid, over the protests of the Spanish ambassador, the police attacked the building with incendiary explosives. A fire ensued as police prevented those inside of the embassy from exiting the building. In all, 36 {{people were killed in}} the fire. The funeral of the victims (including the hitherto obscure father of Rigoberta Menchú, Vicente Menchú) attracted hundreds of thousands of mourners, and a new guerrilla group was formed commemorating the date, the Frente patriotico 31 <b>de</b> <b>enero</b> (Patriotic Front of 31 January). The incident has been called [...] "the defining event" [...] of the Guatemalan Civil War. The Guatemalan government issued a statement claiming that its forces had entered the embassy {{at the request of the}} Spanish Ambassador, and that the occupiers of the embassy, whom they referred to as [...] "terrorists," [...] had [...] "sacrificed the hostages and immolated themselves afterward." [...] Ambassador Cajal denied the claims of the Guatemalan government and Spain immediately terminated diplomatic relations with Guatemala, calling the action a violation of [...] "the most elementary norms of international law."

2500|$|The Fiesta Grande <b>de</b> <b>Enero</b> is {{a celebration}} which joins a number of events which all happen {{in the month of}} January. Originally, these were the feast days of patron saints and other figures, {{including}} a Christ figure called the Our Lord of Esquipulas, [...] Anthony the Great and Saint Sebastian. Since then, it has developed to include other events and overall it is meant to give thanks for what has been received over the past year. On 8 January, the Fiesta Grande is announced and the first of the dances, by dancers called “Chuntas,” is performed. [...] The feast day of the Our Lord of Esquipulas is on January 15, who is honored where he is kept at the Señor de Milagros Church. [...] On 16 January the festival of Saint Sebastian is announced. 17 January is dedicated to San Antonio Abad with a parade of Parachicos. [...] On 18 January, the Parachicos visit the graves of deceased patrons. On 19 January the festival of Saint Sebastian is announced. The 20th is dedicated to this saint as well, with activities starting early and foods such as pepita con tasajo to the public. On the 21 of January a naval battle takes place on the Grijalva River, which consists of a spectacle using thousands of fireworks. This tradition began in 1599, when Pedro de Barrientos, vicar of the Santo Domingo Church, encouraged the development of fireworks making. He came up with the naval battle idea as a diversion and over time it became a way to fascinate visitors. Today, the battle is a recreation of the Battle of Puerto Arturo which occurred on 21 January 1906, by a group of local firework makers. On 22 January, there is a parade with floats. [...] This day is marked with confetti and mariachis along with various types of dancers. The last day, the 23rd is marked by a parade of dancers. Then there is a mass. During these last hours, the drums and flutes play a melancholy tune as the fireworks ends and the streets quiet. The Parachicos cry during their mass as the festival ends. The traditional food during this time is pork with rice and pepita con tasajo.|$|E
