In the initial stage of our study, we measured the entrance surface <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> and kerma area product for chest radiography in five major health institutions in the country. A total of 214 patients were observed. We reported the mean value, minimum and third quartile values, as well as maximum values of surface <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> and kerma area product of patient doses. In the second stage, the possibilities for dose reduction were investigated. Mean kerma area product values were 0. 8 ± 0. 5 Gycm 2 for the posterior-anterior projection and 1. 6 ± 0. 9 Gycm 2 for the lateral projection. The max/min ratio for the entrance surface <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> was found to be 53 for the posterior-anterior projection and 88 for the lateral projection. Comparing the results obtained in Montenegro with results from other countries, we concluded that patient doses in our medical centres are significantly higher.

A dosemeter adapted to millimetric beams of medium-energy X-rays is then required. This work presents the characterization of a dosemeter prototype for this particular application. Methods:A scintillating optical fibre dosemeter (called DosiRat) has been implemented to perform real-time dose measurements with the dedicated small animal X-RAD® 225 Cx (Precision X-Ray, Inc., North Branford, CT) irradiator. Its sensitivity, stem effect, stability, linearity and measurement precision were determined in large field conditions for three different beam qualities, consistent with small animal irradiation and imaging parameters. Results:DosiRat demonstrates good sensitivity and stability; excellent <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> and <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> rate linearity; and a good repeatability for <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> rates > 1 [*]mGy[*]s− 1. The stem effect {{was found to be}} negligible. DosiRat showed limited precision for low <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> rate measurements (< 1 [*]mGy[*]s− 1), typically for imaging protocols. A positive energy dependence was found that can be accounted for by calibrating the dosemeter at the needed beam qualities. Conclusion:The dosimetric performances of DosiRat are very promising. Extensive studies of DosiRat energy dependence are still required. Further developments will allow to reduce the dosemeter size to ensure millimetric beams dosimetry and perform small animal in vivo dosimetry.

We estimated the Ka,e using the X-ray tube outputs and selected parameters. To {{estimate the}} <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> values in the regions of the eyes and thyroid, we used thermoluminescent dosimeters. Results: The Ka,e values ranged from 0. 065 to 1. 446 mGy in cavum radiographs, from 0. 104 to 7. 298 mGy in Caldwell views, and from 0. 113 to 7. 824 mGy in Waters views. <b>Air</b> <b>kerma</b> values {{in the region of}} the eyes ranged from 0. 001 to 0. 968 mGy in cavum radiographs and from 0. 011 to 0. 422 mGy in Caldwell and Waters views.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present paper is to {{evaluate}} interventional radiology x-ray system performance in order to analyze its influence on patient dose. Entrance <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> rate in fluoroscopy modes and aire kerma per image in cine modes were measured at the entrance of PMMA slabs (10 to 30 cm) in two interventional x-ray systems. <b>Air</b> <b>kerma</b> evaluation was performed in all image intensifiers (II) diameters and in all fluoroscopy and cine modes used in the clinical practice with an ionization chamber. High and low contrast resolution was evaluated for all PMMA thickness, II and modes, with two quality image tests (NEMA XR 21 and Leeds TOR- 18 FG). Significant differences were found in <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> rate and <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> per image in both x-ray systems for comparable II and modes. For example, for 24 cm PMMA thickness in fluoroscopic high dose mode, in one x-ray system delivers 0. 49 mGy/s and the other one 1. 87 mGy/s. However, differences in image quality were not significant. In the same conditions described above, Leeds test showed: 0. 032 (low contrast) and 1. 25 lpmm (spatial frequency). In addition, when phantom thickness increase, image quality decreases in x-ray systems, but in one of them, the difference is high. Results show that patient dose and image quality depend on the x-ray system characteristics. Due to this it is essential to perform a complete evaluation of the x-ray system in order to help interventional cardiologists (radiologists) to learn possibilities of dose reduction with no lose of image quality.

40|$|ObjectivesThe aim of {{this study}} was to analyze the {{relationship}} between beam angulation and <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> in a modern cardiac catheterization laboratory. BackgroundRecent reports have identified the merits of reducing radiation scatter, an important determinant of radiation dose in the catheterization laboratory. Radiation scatter is poorly characterized in the context of catheterization laboratories using modern digital equipment. Understanding the principles of dosimetry may reduce the radiation exposure to patients, providers, and medical staff. MethodsProspectively captured radiation data were extracted from a database of 1, 975 diagnostic catheterizations (DCs) and 755 percutaneous coronary interventions (PCIs), which included 138, 342 fluoroscopic and 35, 440 acquisition (cine) sequences. Fluoroscopy and acquisition modes were categorized into tertiles based on the total <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> measured at a standard reference point. Radiation maps were modeled according to the relative proportion of exposure in each projection. ResultsMedian <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> during DCs and PCIs was 677 and 2, 188 mGy, respectively. Fluoroscopy contributed to 66. 3 % of total dose during PCIs compared with 39. 7 % during DCs (p <  0. 001). Fluoroscopy was more sensitive to changes in angulation with a rapid increase in total <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> on small increases in beam angulation. Complex spatial maps were created to study the impact of angulation and other covariates on total <b>air</b> <b>kerma.</b> Besides beam angulation, body surface area was the strongest predictor of the total <b>air</b> <b>kerma.</b> ConclusionsThis study uniquely describes radiation dosimetry using contemporary equipment in a real-world setting.

The aim of this work was to analyse the contribution of forward-scattered radiation for typical <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> measurements. Measurements of forward-scatter were performed with a plane-parallel ionisation chamber on four mammography units. The forward-scatter contribution to the <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> was 2 - 10 % and increased with the compression paddle thickness, but also with the half-value layer value. For incident <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> in mammography, it can be as important to consider forward-scattered as backscattered radiation. If an ionisation chamber is used, the compression paddle should be in contact with the chamber; otherwise the <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> and absorbed dose will be underestimated. If a dosemeter based on semiconductors with much less sensitivity to scattered radiation is used, it is suggested that a forward-scatter factor (FSF) is applied.

40|$|In recent times, {{ionizing}} radiation {{has been used}} {{around the world to}} screen persons for non-medical purposes, namely to detect bulk explosives or other contraband hidden on the body including materials not registered by metal detectors. In contrast to conventional transmission or projection imaging, backscatter and forward-scatter systems employ a “flying spot ” of x rays and large-area detectors. A small spot is rastered across an individual and the Compton scatter signal collected by these detectors is quickly integrated and assigned to a pixel value in an image corresponding to the transient location of the small flying spot.

40|$|The {{protective}} shielding {{design of a}} mammography facility requires {{the knowledge of the}} scattered radiation by the patient and image receptor components. The shape and intensity of secondary x-ray beams depend on the kVp applied to the x-ray tube, target/filter combination, primary x-ray field size, and scattering angle. Currently, shielding calculations for mammography facilities are performed based on scatter fraction data for Mo/Mo target/filter, even though modern mammography equipment is designed with different anode/filter combinations. In this work we present scatter fraction data evaluated based on the x-ray spectra produced by a Mo/Mo, Mo/Rh and W/Rh target/filter, for 25, 30 and 35 kV tube voltages and scattering angles between 30 and 165 degrees. Three mammography phantoms were irradiated and the scattered radiation was measured with a CdZnTe detector. The primary x-ray spectra were computed with a semiempirical model based on the <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> and HVL measured with an ionization chamber. The results point out that the scatter fraction values are higher for W/Rh than for Mo/Mo and Mo/Rh, although the primary and scattered <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> are lower for W/Rh than for Mo/Mo and Mo/Rh target/filter combinations. The scatter fractions computed in this work were applied in a shielding design calculation in order to evaluate shielding requirements for each of these target/filter combinations. Besides, shielding requirements have been evaluated converting the scattered <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> from mGy/week to mSv/week adopting initially a conversion coefficient from <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> to effective dose as 1 Sv/Gy and then a mean conversion coefficient specific for the x-ray beam considered.

MethodsPatients were randomized to radial or femoral access, {{as a part of the}} RIVAL (RadIal Vs. femorAL) trial (N = 7, 021). Fluoroscopy time was prospectively collected in 5740 patients and radiation dose quantified as <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> in 1, 445 patients and dose-area product (DAP) in 2, 255 patients.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to perform a {{detailed}} analysis of the <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> values around a Liac mobile linear accelerator working in a conventional operating room (OR) for IORT. The Liac delivers electron beams at 4, 6, 8 and 10 MeV. A radiation survey to determine photon leakage and scatter consisted of <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> measurements on a spherical surface of 1. 5 m radius, centered on the titanium exit window of the accelerating structure. Measurements were taken using a 30 cm 3 calibrated cylindrical ion chamber in three orthogonal planes, at the maximum electron energy. For each point, 10 Gy was delivered. At selected points, the quality of x-ray radiation was determined by using lead sheets, and measurements were performed for all energies to investigate the energy dependence of stray radiation. The photon scatter contribution from the metallic internal patient-shielding in IORT, used to protect normal tissues underlying the target, was also evaluated. At seven locations outside the OR, the <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> values derived from in-room measurements were compared to measurements directly performed using a survey meter. The results, for a delivere...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBackgroundTask {{group number}} 40 (TG- 40) of the American Association of Physicists in Medicine (AAPM) has {{recommended}} calibration of any brachytherapy source before its clinical use. GZP 6 afterloading brachytherapy unit is a 60 Co high dose rate (HDR) system recently {{being used in}} some of the Iranian radiotherapy centers. AimIn this study <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> strength (AKS) of 60 Co source number three of this unit was estimated by Monte Carlo simulation and in air measurements. Materials and methodsSimulation was performed by employing the MCNP- 4 C Monte Carlo code. Self-absorption of the source core and its capsule were taken into account when calculating <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> strength. In-air measurements were performed according to the multiple distance method; where a specially designed jig and a 0. 6 cm 3 Farmer type ionization chamber were used for the measurements. Monte Carlo simulation, in air measurement and GZP 6 treatment planning results were compared for primary <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> strength (as for November 8 th 2005). ResultsMonte Carlo calculated and in <b>air</b> measured <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> strength were respectively equal to 17240. 01 μGym 2 h− 1 and 16991. 83 μGym 2 h− 1. The value provided by the GZP 6 treatment planning system (TPS) was “ 15355 μGym 2 h− 1 ”. ConclusionThe calculated and measured AKS values are in good agreement. Calculated-TPS and measured-TPS AKS values are also in agreement within the uncertainties related to our calculation, measurements and those certified by the GZP 6 manufacturer. Considering the uncertainties, the TPS value for AKS is validated by our calculations and measurements, however, it is incorporated with a large uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|Objective: This study {{aimed at}} {{investigating}} the <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> {{distribution of the}} radiation output in two and three dimensions of three general radiographic units by physical measurements. Methods: A 6 -cm 3 ionization chamber was placed at 5 -cm intervals of 225 locations in a 70 × 70 cm 2 x-ray beam field. The chamber was placed {{at a level of}} 30 cm above the x-ray table to measure the <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> intensity of the x-ray output across the whole area. Three different brands of radiographic units with different anode target angles and at different tube aging stages were studied. The same exposure parameters were used for each location, and measurements were made for three different tube potentials at 60, 85, and 110 kilovoltage peaks (kV[p]). Results: At the tube potential of 85 kV(p), the relative maximum percentage differences on the average <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> measured along the central anode-cathode axis (x-axis) of the x-ray tube were found to be 31. 5 %, 15. 5 %, and 43. 1 % more at the cathode ends than those at the anode ends of the three radiographic units. Results of a paired samples t test (confidence intervals at 95 %, two-tailed) on three of the four fixed pair-wise sampling points along the x-axis were found to be statistically significant in their relative percentage differences in <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> intensity with respect to the central point (labeled as 35 cm) with a P value ≤. 03. However, those measured at four fixed pair-wise points at 90 ° across the anode-cathode direction were all found to be statistically nonsignificant (P ≥. 29). Similar trends were observed for the other two tube potentials tested. From the three-dimensional displays of radiation output intensity, a similar unique pyramidal shape pattern with a skewed peak toward the cathode end was observed for all three diagnostic x-ray tubes tested. Conclusions: The anode heel effect was found to be enhanced in the x-ray tube with a smaller anode target angle, more aging, and higher tube potentials. Three-dimensional <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> distribution maps of the three x-ray units tested were found to be similar in pattern, and this was displayed in detail regarding the extent of the anode heel effect.

40|$|This study {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} aluminum-copper alloy filtration, without the original aluminum filter, for dental radiography in terms of x-ray energy spectrum, <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> rate and image quality. Comparisons of various thicknesses of aluminum-copper alloy in three different percentages were made with aluminum filtration. Tests were conducted on an intra-oral dental x-ray machine and were made on mandible phantom and on step-wedge. Depending on the thickness of aluminum-copper alloy filtration, the beam could be hardened and filtrated. The use of the aluminum-copper alloy filter resulted in reductions in <b>air</b> <b>kerma</b> rate from 8. 40 % to 47. 33 %, and indicated the same image contrast when compared to aluminum filtration. Aluminum-copper alloy filtration may be considered a good alternative to aluminum filtration...|$|R
