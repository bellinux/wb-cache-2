There exists a range of values for the parameters of the map where the number of different macroscopic configurations is very large, and there is violation of selfaveraging. The time averages of functions, which depend on a single element, computed over a time $T$, have probability distributions that do not collapse to a delta function, for increasing $T$ and $N$. This happens for both chaotic and regular motion, i. e. positive or negative Lyapunov exponent.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} effects of finite {{perturbations}} in fully developed turbulence by introducing {{a measure of the}} chaoticity degree associated to a given scale of the velocity field. This allows one to determine the predictability time for non-infinitesimal perturbations, generalizing the usual concept of maximum Lyapunov exponent. We also determine the scaling law for our indicator in the framework of the multifractal approach. We find that the scaling exponent is not sensitive to intermittency corrections, but is an invariant of the multifractal models. A numerical test of the results is performed in the shell model for the turbulent energy cascade.

We present local detail-preserving entropy plots for a variety of packers, showing that many appear to <b>pack</b> <b>files</b> in a distinctive manner.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the predictability problem in dynamical systems with many {{degrees of freedom}} and {{a wide spectrum of}} temporal scales. In particular, we study the case of $ 3 D$ turbulence at high Reynolds numbers by introducing a finite-size Lyapunov exponent which measures the growth rate of finite-size perturbations. For sufficiently small perturbations this quantity coincides with the usual Lyapunov exponent. When the perturbation is still small compared to large-scale fluctuations, but large compared to fluctuations at the smallest dynamically active scales, the finite-size Lyapunov exponent is inversely proportional to the square of the perturbation size. Our results are supported by numerical experiments on shell models. We find that intermittency corrections do not change the scaling law of predictability. We also discuss the relation between finite-size Lyapunov exponent and information entropy.

40|$|Impact craters {{exist on}} various solid {{objects in the}} {{planetary}} system. A simplified analogy {{of the process of}} their formation is here analyzed by standard solid state physics and the so called dynamic quantized fracture mechanics. An expression which links the crater volume to the parameters of the impactor and the target is obtained within the two approaches. For low impactor energy, this expression is of the same mathematical form as the one resulting from recent experiments. It is shown that the formation of an impact crater is possible even without heating of the target, if the critical stress in the target satisfies certain conditions. The critical value of the stress needed for the occurence of a fracture is calculated for three craters: two terrestrial and one lunar crater. The approach presented here uses only measurable material parameters, and is therefore more realistic than the treatement of the same problem using the cohesive energy of materials.

Lett. 75, 2176, (1995)) {{in order to}} generalize the so called Phase field model of Langer. The Hamiltonian contains two O(N) invariant fields ϕ and U bilinearly coupled. The order parameter field ϕ evolves according to a non conserved dynamics, whereas the diffusive field U follows a conserved dynamics. In the limit N →∞ we obtain an exact solution, which displays an interesting kinetic behavior characterized by three different growth regimes. In the early regime the system displays normal scaling and the average domain size grows as t^ 1 / 2, in the intermediate regime one observes a finite wavevector instability, which {{is related to the}} Mullins-Sekerka instability; finally, in the late stage the structure function has a multiscaling behavior, while the domain size grows as t^ 1 / 4.

50|$|The {{design of}} the cloop driver {{requires}} that compressed blocks be read whole from disk.

On the other hand, because <b>files</b> are <b>packed</b> together, reading a compressed block may thus bring {{in more than one}} file into the cache.

40|$|Comparing {{experimental}} data for high temperature cuprate superconductors with numerical results for electronic models, {{it is becoming}} apparent that a hopping along the plaquette diagonals has to be included to obtain a quantitative agreement. According to recent estimations {{the value of the}} diagonal hopping t' appears to be material dependent. However, the values for t' discussed in the literature were obtained comparing theoretical results in the weak coupling limit with experimental photoemission data and band structure calculations. The goal {{of this paper is to}} study how t' gets renormalized as the interaction between electrons, U, increases. For this purpose, the effect of adding a bare diagonal hopping t' to the fully interacting two dimensional Hubbard model Hamiltonian is investigated using numerical techniques. Positive and negative values of t' are analyzed. Spin-spin correlations, n(k), 〈 n〉 vs μ, and local magnetic moments are studied for values of U/t ranging from 0 to 6, and as a function of the electronic density. The influence of the diagonal hopping in the spectral function A(k,ω) is also discussed, and the changes in the gap present in the density of states at half-filling are studied. We introduce a new criterion to determine probable locations of Fermi surfaces at zero temperature from n(k) data obtained at finite temperature. It appears that hole pockets at k=(π/ 2,π/ 2) may be induced for negative t' while a positive t' produces similar features at k=(π, 0) and (0,π). Comparisons with the standard 2 D Hubbard (t'= 0) model indicate that a negative t' hopping amplitude appears to be dynamically generated. In general, we conclude that it is very dangerous to extract a bare parameter of the Hamiltonian (t') from PES data whereComment: 9 pages (RevTex 3. 0), 12 figures (postscript), <b>files</b> <b>packed</b> with uufile...|$|R

These methods were proposed for automatic unpacking of <b>packed</b> <b>files</b> by applying either static or dynamic analysis.
