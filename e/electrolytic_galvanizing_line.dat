40|$|Abstract- The {{continuous}} hot dip <b>galvanizing</b> <b>line</b> {{is mainly}} {{dedicated to the}} production of galvanized corrugated & plain coils for the market. The process combines of 3 stages: metallurgical annealing, zinc coating deposition & temper rolling. Due to manual operation at zinc coating area, zinc consumption is higher & coating weight thickness is uncertain. Moreover, manual interventions, varying with the operative personnel, inevitably resulted in coating thickness fluctuations & out of range coatings. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to identify & understand the parameters which affect the coating thickness over CR coil. The dependent variable, zinc coating weight is used as a measure of profitability. Relation between the dependent & independent variable helps in identifying the critical parameter or group of parameters which directly affects the process & ultimately final product. The current data recorded, examined & analyzed for deciding the criticality of independent variables over the dependent one. A strong significant relationship between coating weight control & profitability has been found in previous empirical work. This research work is aimed at analyzing the effect of process parameters on consumption of zinc in continuous <b>galvanizing</b> <b>line</b> thereby calculating the exact set of parameters to decide the actual coating thickness required.

The coating is characterized {{with a series of}} single laser bursts irradiated on the traversing sheet steel, each on a different sheet steel position. To achieve an ablation depth in the range of the coating thickness of about 10 µm a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm in collinear double pulse mode was used. The depth information is obtained by control of the ablation depth by adjusting the burst energy using an external electro-optical attenuator. Concepts for the determination of the coating thickness and the chemical composition are presented.

40|$|LIBS {{can be used}} as {{an online}} method of characterizing {{galvanized}} coatings on sheet steel moving through a production line. The traversing sheet steel is irradiated with a series of single laser bursts, each at a different position on the sheet steel. An ablation depth in the same range as the coating thickness (about 10 µm) is achieved by using a Nd:YAG laser at 1064 nm in collinear double-pulse mode. The coating thickness is determined from the ratio of the intensities of an iron line and a zinc line measured at a burst energy high enough to penetrate the coating with a single burst. Experiments at different burst energies were carried out to optimize the thickness resolution, and a method of systematically selecting iron and zinc lines was deduced, which is based on multivariate data analysis (MVDA) of the intensity ratios calculated for a set of 6 zinc lines and 21 iron lines. A temperature correction was applied, because the parameters of the plasma change with burst energy, and the influence of this on the thickness resolution is discussed. The ambient atmosphere present (air, Ar, N 2) as well as self-absorption of spectral lines both have an influence on the thickness resolution.

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} {{to the question of}} how to choose estimator memory length in system identification. Traditional approaches to this problem have been based on stationary models for parameter time variations. This leads to a fixed trade-off between the "size" of parameter variations and the "size" of noise. However, in practice, one often experiences non-stationary parameter behaviour. The latter problem leads to the desirability of some form of time varying estimator memory. In particular, a short memory is desirable when rapid parameter changes occur. However, a long memory is desirable when infrequent parameters change occur so as to give maximal noise discrimination. The current paper discusses these issues at a conceptual rather than theoretical level. We illustrate the ideas by reference to parameter estimation in zinc <b>galvanizing</b> <b>lines...</b>|$|R

Abstract: In this paper, an active vibration {{control of the}} translating steel strip in the zinc <b>galvanizing</b> <b>line</b> is investigated. The unwanted vibrations of the strip deteriorate the uniformity of the deposited mass on the surfaces of the steel strip and the consumption of zinc. The translating steel strip is modelled as a moving belt equation by using Hamilton’s principle for the systems with changing mass. The total mechanical energy {{of the system is}} considered as a Lyapunov function candidate. A nonlinear boundary control law that assures the exponential stability of the closed loop system is derived.
