The final aim was to propose a control strategy to optimise the processes by adapting their parameters according to the quality of the raw material. When the research started, earlier automation systems had focused on keeping the process alive, and economic values such as wood loss were not considered important. The process is usually controlled manually and shifts have different ways to manage it, which are based on trial and error. Bark removal in chemical pulp mills is usually higher than the values recommended in the literature, which in turn causes log breaking in the drum and increases wood loss. Even a small reduction in wood loss could have a substantial financial outcome. The lack of raw materials some time ago and the recession nowadays have highlighted the importance of more efficient log use. Data survey techniques were employed to reveal the interactions between drum variables from noisy measurements. Wood room data were analysed by modelling and deriving conclusions from the resulting parameters. In addition, log breaking and the size distribution of the chips were analysed under different process conditions. A pilot-scale drum was used to study residence time and the mechanical abrasion of logs. The results of this work indicated that the ratio of the volume of logs in the drum to capacity determines the residence time of the logs in the drum. Other variables influence the volume of logs in the drum, which together with capacity determine the residence time of logs in the drum, which affects wood loss and bark removal. The effect of capacity on the size distribution of the chips was not unambiguous, however, and it was therefore recommended to operate wood room at high capacity, because this reduces wood loss and increases annual production. The proposed control strategy adapts the residence time of logs in the drum to the quality of the debarked raw material by controlling the position of the closing gate. In addition, the control strategy adjusts the rotating speed of the drum using an open loop control. The results can be used to optimise the wood room process parameters. If the problem in wood room is excessive debarking, the residence time of the logs can be reduced and the rotating speed of the drum lowered. In this way the logs will be damaged less and wood loss will be reduced. Bark removal requirements in mechanical pulp mills are high, and the process parameters can be adapted to avoid problems in the subsequent processes due to excessive bark...|$|E

40|$|Single stem short {{rotation}} plantations in the United States {{are largely}} dedicated to pulp production, with fuel as a secondary product. There are very limited plantings for fuel production, and others where {{the primary purpose}} is treatment of various wastewater’s. All production harvesting of single stem plantations is conducted with conventional forestry equipment. In the west, fellerbunchers. borapple skidders, chain fail delimber/debarker/chippers are used, and pulp furnish is transported in chip vans. Residues are cornminuted. and transported to energy facilities. In the Southeast. felled and bunched trees are deiimbed by skidders with irongate delimbers, and hauled to the pulp mill or a chipping plant in tree length form, where they are <b>drum</b> <b>debarked</b> and then chipped. Limbs and foliage are left on site. So far, there have only been limited trials with other equipment. The Canadian NRCC/HYD-Mech FB- 7 * and FB- 12 continuous-travel feller/buncher heads were tested in short rotation plantations. The FB- 7 worked well. but with trees much smaller than those currently being grown for pulp. The FB- 12, attached to an old carrier with poor hydraulics, was not veq productive with larger trees. The head appeared to have inherent deficiencies, the main one being the accumulation approach: holding trees vertically but loosely. This tended to put overturning moments on the machine and limited the sizes of the bunches that could be built. The Missoula Technology and Development Centre (MTDC) Harvester is a continuous-travel feller/buncher which has a collecting bunk and saw assembly mounted on a Timber/Jack 520 A prime mover (I&sky, 1992). When trees are severed, a rotating “bat ” knocks them into the collection bed where they lay horizontally. Bunches are side-dumped from the bunk.

40|$|The {{incidence}} of microbes in the nasal cavities {{of workers in}} three paper and board mills was investigated. A total of 234 persons exposed to microbial aerosols and splashes from paper machine wires and <b>debarker</b> <b>drums</b> formed the exposed group. The control group consisted of 294 workers from the dry working areas: the winding and packing sections. Chi-square {{analysis was used to}} test the differences in the frequency of microbial incidence and various symptoms between the exposed and control groups. The nasal cavities of many workers, particularly workers in the debarkers, proved to be contaminated by Klebsiella pneumoniae, other coliforms, yeasts, and molds; usually only one microbe was involved, but sometimes two or several species were found. Nasal bacteria and yeasts were largely derived from the mill and debarker air; the microbes in the air came mainly from process waters. Lack of association of nasopharyngeal symptoms with either exposure to aerosols or nasal microbial contamination was interpreted as an indication of host defenses that were adequate to protect workers from harmful microbial colonization in paper mill environments...|$|R
40|$|Interaction {{type and}} {{intensity}} {{are the main}} factors that influence the efficiency of pulpwood <b>debarking</b> in <b>debarking</b> <b>drum.</b> This technological process is a scantily known complex subject. That is why new decisions on improvement of pulpwood debarking process have met difficulties. The article deals with computer simulation, which explains the pulpwood diameter (mass) effect on its collision characteristics in debarking process by means of drum. Work goal: the determination ofmaximum interaction force at collisions of pulpwood of unequal diameter (or mass). Earlier offered mathematical simulation for numerical determination of this force is applied. The experimental data for spruce pulpwood stiffness were used as initial data for calculation. A simulation application has been demonstrated by six case-studies. In all of them pulpwood 1. 2 m length was taken into account. Two different diameters of spruce pulpwood (0. 12 m with a mass of 9 kg and 0. 20 m with a mass of 31 kg) were used to reconstruct pulpwood collisions in the numerical experiment. As {{a result of the}} work, it was established that pulpwood diameter decrease leads to the increase of collisions number in the unit of time. The forces of contact interaction reach maximum more quickly. However, the maximum of pulpwood collisions force is decreased in the considered cases...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to study how the origin and {{treatment}} histories of spruce (Picea abies) and pine (Pinus radiata, Pinus sylvestris) bark influence on the extraction yield of tannin. The bark is produced in large quantities during the debarking process and is considered as waste in traditional forest industry. Bark is mainly used for energy production. In comparison to wood tissue, bark contains more extractives that could have potential for various applications in pharmaceutical industry or bio-based adhesives. Stilbenes, lignans, flavonoids and tannins are typical extractives in wood bark. In this Master’s thesis, {{the focus is on}} the extraction of tannins. Bark raw materials were obtained from pulp mills and sawmills. Bark samples were processed as air-dried (drying < 50 °C) or fresh as it is after debarking. Samples were extracted in rotating air bath reactors at 90 °C and 10 % consistency. Eight batches were hot water extracted and five different time points were studied: 40, 60, 80, 100 and 120 minutes. The extracts were analyzed with three UV-spectrophotometric methods: Folin-Ciocalteu assay, UV- 280 nm method and Acid-Butanol assay. UV- 280 nm method was used in tannin yield calculations. Tannin yield was the highest from air-dried spruce bark from sawmill (5. 63 % from original dry bark). The second highest tannin yield (3. 33 %) was from air-dried sawmill pine (Pinus radiata) bark extract. Fresh sawmill spruce and pine bark extraction gave 2. 59 % and 2. 65 % for tannin yield, respectively. The poorest yields came from the pulp mill bark samples. Yields from fresh and air-dried pulp mill spruce barks were 0. 41 % and 0. 97 %, respectively. In comparison, the tannin yields from fresh and air-dried pulp mill pine (Scots pine) bark were 1. 13 % and 1. 20 %. Results showed that the tannin yield increased when the extraction time increased. Statistical analysis confirmed that the origin and the treatment have a significant influence on the extraction yield of tannin. The reason for the differences in the extraction yields between barks with different origins are probably related to the different debarking methods. Sawmill bark samples gave a significantly higher tannin yield than samples from pulp mill. In sawmills, logs are debarked as dry in rotary <b>debarker.</b> <b>Drum</b> debarkers are typically being used in pulp and paper mills where water is used in debarking process. Contact with water may leach water-soluble tannins from bark. This is in accordance with the results that bark from sawmill was found to be an optimal raw material for hot water extraction. Further research should focus on optimizing hot water extraction conditions eg. by applications of chemicals...|$|R
