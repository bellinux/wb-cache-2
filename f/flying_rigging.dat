50|$|Flying rigs {{are used}} to fly scenery or {{performers}} in a more elaborate fashion than typical line sets. A <b>flying</b> <b>rig</b> typically allows horizontal as well as vertical movement by paying out individual lift lines to varying lengths and/or {{through the use of}} tracks. Flying rigs usually involve specialized equipment and techniques operated by a relatively experienced crew. Peter Foy is known for his innovations in manual <b>flying</b> <b>rigs,</b> especially those used in theatrical productions of Peter Pan. Automated <b>flying</b> <b>rigs,</b> which synchronize multiple point hoists, are becoming more common as motor control systems become safer and more sophisticated.|$|R
50|$|Point hoists, {{also known}} as spot line winches, control a single lift line and are {{commonly}} used for automated spot <b>rigging</b> or <b>flying</b> <b>rigs.</b> A point hoist may operate in solitude, or in unison with other point hoists to comprise a line set.|$|R

50|$|Just after World War II, Ryan {{engineers}} {{wondered whether}} the Ryan/U.S. Navy FR-1 Fireball, which had a thrust-to-weight ratio of 1 at low fuel quantities, would take off vertically. The United States Navy's Bureau of Aeronautics in 1947 awarded Ryan a contract, originally under the designation F3R, to investigate {{the development of a}} vertically launched jet fighter. This was part of a program to evaluate the feasibility of submarine-based aircraft. Ryan conducted remote controlled VTOL tethered rig tests from 1947 to 1950 and a <b>flying</b> <b>rig</b> in 1951. Ryan was awarded an Air Force contract in 1953 to develop an actual flying jet-powered VTOL aircraft, which was given the designation X-13. Two prototypes were built.|$|R
5000|$|To {{make sure}} the visual effects were made in just one year and without {{exceeding}} the budget, special effects supervisor John Bruno shipped the 900 effects shots to eleven companies in four countries - United States, New Zealand, United Kingdom and Canada - and did extensive previsualization. Their work begun in April 2005, before the director Brett Ratner had even been announced, and Bruno made sure to emphasize practical effects, [...] "shoot as many practical elements as possible, and only use CG when we had to." [...] For instance, complex wirework rigs were employed which enabled the actors to do some stunts without resorting to digital doubles, including a computer controlled <b>flying</b> <b>rig</b> from Cirque Du Soleil for Angel's flight, and one for Halle Berry's flying spins.|$|R
50|$|On an {{irregular}} basis the school stages musical productions which are {{conducted by the}} music department and its directors and teachers. In 2002, at Leeton's Roxy Theatre, St. Francis staged Oliver! with an extensive cast and crew. In 2005 they premiered the production of Buralga which was written by the school's music teacher and director, Mark Ciavarella. Production was undertaken by former student, Paul Marin, and his production company using several kilometres of cable {{and hundreds of thousands}} of dollars worth of professional equipment including moving lights, smoke machines, <b>flying</b> <b>rigs</b> and other stage equipment. It was filmed and a limited number of DVDs were produced, most going to the cast and crew. The school also holds an annual performing and visual arts showcase which exhibits the school's music, drama, visual arts, photography and digital media disciplines, as well as the hospitality department, which provides canapés for the intermission break.|$|R
50|$|During the tech, {{all of the}} {{previous}} actions taken during the dry tech are repeated, so as to check lighting in concordance with the staged blocking and stage placement (for example, finding whether the performer is in the light hotspot or not, or how the followspot operates), check the levels on the performers' microphones (if used) and how well the performers can project if orating concurrently with sound or music, allow the performers to know when there are incoming <b>flying</b> <b>rigs,</b> allow performers to experience and become accustomed to the special effects that will occur {{so that it will}} not interfere with the actual performance and generally make sure the director and designers are happy with all aspects of the production that can be seen or heard. One very significant effect that is added in tech is blood. This allows actors {{to get used to it}} and the costume designer to see how the blood will affect the costumes.|$|R
5000|$|The novel recounts {{events which}} {{occur on the}} fictional planet Windhaven. Its {{inhabitants}} are the descendants of human space voyagers who crash-landed on Windhaven centuries before {{the events of the}} book take place. After the crash, the survivors spread out and settled on the many scattered islands of Windhaven's waterworld. In order to preserve tenuous lines of communication across the vast seas, the stranded population constructed mechanically simple gliding rigs from available spaceship wreckage; the gliders could be kept aloft almost indefinitely in Windhaven's stormy atmosphere by their pilots. After centuries of using this practice as the principal means of maintaining social contact among the islands, Windhaven's flyers have developed into a caste superior to the landsmen. Additionally, the flyer caste maintains ownership of the <b>flying</b> <b>rigs</b> — commonly known as [...] "wings" [...] — by keeping them within flyer families, so none of Windhaven's landsmen can aspire to ever wear them. These caste-based differences serve as the impetus for the novel's character-driven narrative.|$|R
50|$|Since 2006 NoFit State {{have been}} running a {{permanent}} training space / school in Cardiff. They provide a variety of aerial and ground-based classes for all experience levels, including ropes, silks, aerial hoop, static trapeze, acrobalance and juggling. Their training space also houses Wales' only <b>flying</b> trapeze <b>rig.</b> The company run a successful Youth Circus programme, and students have since gone on to study at Circomedia.|$|R
5000|$|In the end, Flo's Diner {{is back to}} normal, and {{it seems}} Mr. Big will not be bothering Flo and Cookie anymore, as his office {{is seen in the}} flash news in ruins thanks to <b>flying</b> {{balloons}} <b>rigging</b> the circuits of the office billboard and turning [...] "Free Interest Money Loan" [...] into [...] "Free Money", causing people to rush into the office, overloading and exploding it in the process.|$|R
25|$|The camera {{platforms}} {{included a}} modified Citroën sedan, camera trucks, helicopters and a <b>flying</b> <b>rig</b> constructed by Dick Parker. Parker had built it for model sequences in Strategic Air Command (1955). The rig {{consisted of two}} construction cranes and a hydraulically operated device to tilt and position a model, along with 200ft (61m) of cables. Parker's rig allowed actors to sit inside full-scale models suspended 50ft (15m) above the ground, yet provide safety and realism for staged flying sequences, with the sky realistically in the background. A further hydraulic platform did away with matte shots of aircraft in flight. The platform was large enough to mount an aircraft and Parker or stunt pilots could manipulate its controls for realistic bluescreen sequences. Composite photography was used when scenes called for difficult shots; these were completed at Pinewood Studios. Some shots were created with rudimentary cockpits and noses grafted to an Alouette helicopter. One scene over Paris was staged with small models when Paris refused an overflight. However, {{for the majority of}} flying scenes, full-scale flying aircraft were employed.|$|R
5000|$|It's All in How You Play - Vernon and Loopy {{discover}} that Russel is upset about not making his school football team {{and make him}} part of Under's Joustabout team (like simplified Quidditch on <b>flying</b> snowboards), <b>rigging</b> all the games so Russel would win. But when Bob discovers this, he makes a killing off of gambling bets, and soon moves onto betting the crown of Under on a one-on-one match between him and Russel.|$|R
50|$|During 2012, {{a version}} of this <b>rig</b> called the <b>flying</b> chod <b>rig</b> was made popular by Jim Shelley. Whereas on a normal chod rig the short hook length is held in place by a stop on the line, a flying chod does not use any form of stop: when a fish picks up the bait it can run freely. Jim Shelley used this {{technique}} in conjunction with slack lines and putting his rod tops in the air.|$|R
60|$|The flames {{continued}} to roar upward, {{and toward the}} island back of the ship, for over an hour. During that time they heard two dull explosions, caused by some barrels of chemicals catching fire. The second explosion sent the bits of burning wood and <b>rigging</b> <b>flying</b> in all directions.|$|R
50|$|Graham Ward is a drummer, sound engineer, {{and sound}} designer. Most of his session {{recordings}} {{were made in}} the 2000s. He has played with Paul McCartney, Elaine Paige, Paul Young, The Pussycat Dolls, Tom Jones, Murray Head, and Nick Heyward.He has also been involved {{with a wide range of}} productions including Festivals, Receiving house theatres, school productions, amateur dramatics, youth band nights, theatre crew, sight marshalling and more. His main focus of knowledge lies within live sound technology, though he does have knowledge within video (analogue and digital), <b>flying</b> and <b>rigging,</b> lighting and power.|$|R
50|$|Most modern flyers {{start out}} wearing a safety harness, while a trainer {{on the ground}} {{controls}} the lines and would pull them if the flyer is in a dangerous situation. Pulling on the lines will suspend the flyer in the air, and {{letting go of the}} lines slowly will bring the flyer to the ground safely. Once a flyer has mastered a particular trick, they will take off the safety harness. Every safe <b>flying</b> trapeze <b>rig</b> has a large net underneath the rig. Many flyers in the circus do not start out using safety belts. Those flyers who are not wearing safety harnesses learn how to fall safely into the net in case they miss a catch or unexpectedly fall off the bar or off the catcher.|$|R
60|$|The {{three men}} at her mast-head wore long {{streamers}} of narrow red bunting at their hats; from the stern, a whale-boat was suspended, bottom down; and hanging captive from the bowsprit was seen the long lower jaw {{of the last}} whale they had slain. Signals, ensigns, and jacks of all colors were <b>flying</b> from her <b>rigging,</b> on every side. Sideways lashed in each of her three basketed tops were two barrels of sperm; above which, in her top-mast cross-trees, you saw slender breakers of the same precious fluid; and nailed to her main truck was a brazen lamp.|$|R
2500|$|Two {{variants}} {{were initially}} envisioned: a 40-seat, short-range civil transport and a flying crane with a 15,000lb capacity. In March 1956, Westland {{decided to build}} the first prototype as a <b>flying</b> test <b>rig</b> with a tubular steel space frame {{in place of the}} main fuselage; cockpit power-train and undercarriage attached to this. With economy a priority, off-the-shelf components were used as far as possible, with donors such as the Westland Whirlwind helicopter and the Bristol Freighter aeroplane. This prototype was completed in February 1958; after the usual static and systems testing, engine runs and nearly 20 hours of [...] "tied-down" [...] engine testing, the first flight took place on 15 June. Flight testing showed up significant vibration. As a result, a number of changes were made {{in the design of the}} second prototype, including replacement of the main-rotor with the six-blade unit from the Sikorsky S-64. Once the statutory ten hours had been flown, this first Westminster was registered G-APLE and work started on constructing the second prototype.|$|R
60|$|But {{although}} in reality Captain Kidd was no hero, {{he has been}} known for a century and more as the great American pirate, and his name has been representative of piracy ever since. Years after he had been hung, when people heard that a vessel with a black flag, or one which looked black in the distance, <b>flying</b> from its <b>rigging</b> had been seen, they forgot that the famous pirate was dead, and imagined that Captain Kidd was visiting their part of the coast in order that he might find a good place to bury some treasure which it was no longer safe for him to carry about.|$|R
5000|$|In the {{interval}} between the blowing up of the Maine and the declaration of war against Spain, Wainwright was assigned command of the tender [...] and placed {{in charge of the}} salvage survey and recovery of the bodies of the victims. He stayed aboard throughout the seven weeks long Sampson court of inquiry, never setting foot in ashore. As the initial salvage closed, for concern about oncoming war, Wainwright remained. On the day that the last salvage team was ordered home, the Spanish naval commander in Havana, Admiral Vincente Manterola, ordered the American flag, which was still <b>flying</b> from the <b>rigging</b> of the wrecked Maine, struck. Wainwright heard of the order and, calling an interpreter, issued an order that immediately made him famous, ...|$|R
60|$|When we {{had been}} at sea two days, a very {{agreeable}} surprise for the monikin party was prepared and executed. I had caused {{a certain number of}} jackets and trousers to be made of the skins of different animals, such as dogs, cats, sheep, tigers, leopards, hogs, etc., etc., with the proper accompaniments of snouts, hoofs, and claws; and, when the ladies came on deck, after breakfast, their eyes were no longer offended by our rude innovations upon nature, but the whole crew were <b>flying</b> about the <b>rigging,</b> like so many animals of the different species named. Noah and myself appeared in the characters of sea-lions, the former having intimated that he understood the nature of that beast better than any other. Of course, this delicate attention was properly appreciated, and handsomely acknowledged.|$|R
50|$|A powered speaker usually weighs {{more than}} an {{equivalent}} passive speaker because the internal amplifier circuitry usually outweighs a speaker-level passive crossover. A loudspeaker associated with an integrated active system is even lighter because it has no internal crossover. A lightweight loudspeaker can be more easily carried and it {{is less of a}} load in <b>rigging</b> (<b>flying).</b> However, active speakers using lightweight Class-D amplifiers have narrowed the difference. Trucking for a sound system involves transporting all of the various components including amplifier racks, speaker cabling and loudspeaker enclosures. Overall shipping weight for an active loudspeaker system may be less than for a passive system because heavy passive speaker cable bundles are replaced by lighter AC cables and small diameter signal cables. Truck space and weight is reduced by eliminating amplifier racks.|$|R
5000|$|The {{installation}} at Mount Surprise was Australian designed: an Air Warning (AW) aerial on an AW tower weighing 12 tons, with AW electronics. It {{is likely}} that the station operated AW Mk2 equipment, designed to be assembled on site from a kit provided. The kit, known as a [...] "Doover", comprised the control tower, a hut for radar operators and mechanic, turning mechanism and radar transmitter/receiver screen and was hauled to the summit of the hill by <b>flying</b> fox. This <b>rig</b> proved extremely reliable and efficient in the tropics and was used by Australian, American and British forces. The operators' hut was lined with masonite and clad with galvanized iron and was supplemented by separate facilities for power generation and distribution, operations and signals. The radar screen in this equipment utilised a 5-inch cathode-ray tube built into the receiver cabinet. The generator likely was powered by a Ford V8 alternator and the aerial was easily put together as it was formed from piping and hand turned.|$|R
