However, nitric acid is not able to (fully) extract silver and other impurities from an alloy with a high content of gold. Therefore, one part of scrap gold was typically alloyed with three parts of copper (quartering) before parting with nitric acid. Another method uses Sterling silver instead of copper. One part pure gold is alloyed with three parts Sterling silver (<b>inquarting).</b> The resulting six karat (6K) gold can then be parted with dilute nitric acid (one part 68-70% nitric acid to one part DISTILLED water). With the karat gold this low (6K), and over medium high heat, the dilute nitric acid will dissolve the Sterling silver (and other base metals in the karat gold) starting on the outside surface of the 6K gold alloy, working its way into the gold alloy, forming a honeycomb structure as it works its way into the metals. Since nitric acid will not dissolve gold, nearly pure gold (very close to 99.5% pure) will be left behind after the reaction is complete. After removing the solid gold other elements like silver and copper may be extracted from the liquid. To get the gold to a very high level of purity (999 fine gold) it is sometimes processed further with aqua regia to effectively remove all the impurities.|$|E

In this method an ash formed by the combustion of a pre-selected coal is mixed with the ash contains gold and one more platinum group of elements, an <b>inquart</b> containing gold and one or more platinum group elements, and fluxing agent to form a ‘charge’. The ‘charge’ is then heated in a furnace to a preselected temperature and forming a molten charge including a molten inquart; absorbing {{a portion of the}} gold and more platinum group elements of the ash into the molten <b>inquart.</b> Casting a dare bar (which contains gold and one or more platinum group elements) by discharging the molten <b>inquart.</b> Digesting the dore bar in an elctrowinning process where the dore bar is introduced as an anode in an acidic bath and an electrical potential is maintained between the cathode and anode, then precipitating and dissolving trace elements in the electrolytic solution producing an anode slime. The digestion of anode slimes is done using 30  % solution of HNO 3. The digestion is filtered and rinsed then the liquid rinsed portion containing Ag in solution is washed with HCl and filtered. The residue is mixed with aqua regia, forming a solution containing gold, platinum and palladium. Gold may then be removed by solvent extraction. Rhodium and other metals may be removed by precipitation by the treatment of the solution with potassium hydroxide and sodium borohydrite. Palladium in solution may be removed by precipitation by treatment with ammonium hydroxide, NH 4 OH, and HCl as the complex PdCl 2 (NH 3) 2. Alternatively, Pd in solution is removed by precipitation with DiMethyl Glyxime, followed by filtration and reduction and ashing of the residue. Platinum in solution is removed by any of the accepted methods including precipitation as impure (NH 4) 2 PtCl 6 after treatment with NH 4 Cl, or leaching H 2 PdCl 4 from solution. An organic solvent such as DiMethyl Glyoxime is used to extract gold, after treatment with NH 4 Cl, the solution should also be treated with ethanol and hydrogen peroxide. The solution is filtered and the residue, including (NH 4) 2 PtCl 6, subjected to reduction and burning leaving an impure platinum sponge. The platinum sponge can be purified by redissolving in aqua-regia. This method is very complex, and a recovery and purity level is not mentioned.|$|R
