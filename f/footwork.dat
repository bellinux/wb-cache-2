5|$|As {{with other}} forms of climbing, bouldering {{technique}} is largely centered on proper <b>footwork.</b> Leg muscles are significantly stronger than arm muscles; thus, proficient boulderers use their arms primarily to maintain balance and body positioning, relying on their legs to push them up the boulder. Boulderers also keep their arms straight whenever possible, allowing their bones to support their body weight rather than their muscles.|$|E
5|$|Chinese Nü Yr is an {{extended}} play (EP) by producer Seamus Malliagh, known by his stage name Iglooghost, released on the Brainfeeder label on 30 October 2015. Containing elements of <b>footwork,</b> bass, grime and 2-step garage, the EP's sound {{is represented by}} a worm who goes through several nonsensical lands. To make Chinese Nü Yr, Malliagh first designed the cover art and then developed songs with structures and sound to fit the artwork. Upon release, the EP garnered generally favorable reviews from critics, a common praise being its unique style.|$|E

5|$|During his youth, Olajuwon was {{a soccer}} goalkeeper, which helped {{give him the}} <b>footwork</b> and agility to balance his size and {{strength}} in basketball, and also contributed to his shot-blocking ability. Olajuwon did not play basketball {{until the age of}} 17, when he entered a local tournament. It has been said that a coach in Nigeria once asked him to dunk and demonstrated while standing on a chair. Olajuwon then tried to stand on the chair himself. When redirected by staff not to use the chair, Hakeem could initially not dunk the basketball.|$|E
5|$|Robben {{was born}} in Bedum, a {{satellite}} town of Groningen, in the northeastern Netherlands. He took to football from an early age, becoming an adherent of the Coerver Method. Robben's skill in ball control and technical <b>footwork</b> made him a valuable player, and he was quickly signed by regional club FC Groningen. Here, he developed his distinctive style of cutting inside from the right onto his left foot to score some quite spectacular goals.|$|E

5|$|Harvey was an attacking and {{free-flowing}} batsman {{but he was}} not {{a prolific}} scorer, which was attributed by observers to a lack of single-mindedness required to succeed at the top level. Neil said that Ray's <b>footwork</b> was suspect and that the stronger bowlers in domestic cricket were able to exploit this. Neil said that if Ray had been able to rectify his weakness, then he could have become a Test player for Australia. Australian captain Bill Lawry said that Harvey was one of the two best district cricketers he had faced. Aside from his batting, Harvey was an occasional leg spinner, and was known for his fielding ability.|$|E

They danced every day and every night while they were visiting the Dotsons, and Robert remained good friends with one of the group's original members.|$|R
5|$|Hobbs' {{success was}} based on fast <b>footwork,</b> an ability to play many {{different}} shots, and excellent placement of the ball. Among the first batsmen to succeed against previously devastating googly bowlers, he adapted his technique to meet the new styles of bowling that arose early in his career; he mixed classical shots with an effective defence. He was particularly successful on difficult pitches for batting. An opening batsman, Hobbs established several effective opening partnerships; with Tom Hayward and Andy Sandham for Surrey and with Wilfred Rhodes and Herbert Sutcliffe for England. His partnership with Sutcliffe remains in 2016 the most effective for the first wicket, in terms of average partnership, in Test history. Contemporaries rated Hobbs extremely highly, and critics continue to list him among the best batsmen of all time.|$|E
5|$|Regarded {{as one of}} the {{greatest}} women soccer players of all time, and by many as the best ever, Hamm was an athletic, dynamic, and technically gifted striker, renowned for her speed, skill, <b>footwork,</b> stamina, and ability on the ball, as well as her consistency. An excellent, agile dribbler, she was highly regarded for her control, as well as her grace, pace, and elegance in possession. A prolific goalscorer, she was known for her powerful and accurate striking ability, although she was also a creative and hard-working forward, and a team player, who was equally capable of assisting many goals for her teammates, due to her accurate passing, and was also willing to aid her teammates defensively when possession was lost. She was capable of playing in any offensive position.|$|E
5|$|The 1951–52 season saw {{the second}} tour to Australia by the West Indies. Morris experimented with his stance {{during the winter}} in {{response}} to criticism about his <b>footwork</b> when facing Bedser. Morris felt that his problems had arisen because he attempted to play excessively on the leg side. He opened his season by punishing the Queenslanders with a score of 253 in a Shield match and then scored 210 against Victoria. In {{the first of these}} innings, Morris had been ill but he struck 253 of his team's 400, with the last 50 coming in only 17 minutes of batting. His Test form was unimpressive though; he started steadily, with 122 runs in the first two Tests, which were won by Australia.|$|E
50|$|Problems beset the 3512 almost immediately, {{as it was}} {{completed}} later than scheduled, and its layout meant that it was large and heavy. When ancillaries like the clutch and flywheel were installed, the engine weighed 418 lb - compared to the V12s of Honda and Ferrari at 352 lb and 308 lb respectively. All this meant {{that it could not}} be properly installed in <b>Footwork's</b> car for the 1991 season, the FA12, and so the team had to redesign this car while starting the season with a modified version of their / car, designated the A11C.|$|R

5|$|Australia dropped Bill Brown, who {{had scored}} 73 runs at a batting average of 24.33 in three Test innings during the season. Brown was Australia's reserve opener, but Bradman opted to play {{him out of}} {{position}} in the middle-order, instead of using a specialist. Brown had also struggled in his unfamiliar position in the matches against Worcestershire and the Marylebone Cricket Club, scoring 25 and 26. According to O'Reilly, Brown had appeared {{out of place in}} the middle-order because he was used to the opener's classical role of defending against and wearing down the opening bowlers, rather than attacking. He was replaced by the all rounder Sam Loxton, who had hammered an unbeaten 159—including several sixes—against Gloucestershire, and that innings was particularly noted for his quick <b>footwork,</b> which he used to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard.|$|E
5|$|Forti {{produced}} a new chassis, the FG03, {{for the next}} race {{of the season in}} Imola. It had been designed by the same personnel as the previous year, with further work carried out by George Ryton after the latter moved to the team from Ferrari and took up the post of Technical Director mid-season. Both drivers judged it a significant improvement over the old car, with increased aerodynamic downforce and directional sensitivity, but there was only one FG03 available, and Montermini failed to qualify in the old car. Badoer, however, qualified last, but comfortably within the 107% cut-off, and only 0.7s behind Ricardo Rosset in the <b>Footwork.</b> Badoer finished 10th and last, but had suffered reliability problems in the new car and was two laps behind Pedro Lamy's Minardi. Both drivers qualified in Monaco, but Montermini crashed in the wet warm-up session and did not start the race, whilst Badoer struggled in the slippery conditions and took out Jacques Villeneuve as he was being lapped by the Williams. He was fined $5000 and received a two-race suspended ban.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, Jardine {{achieved}} his highest {{average in}} a season, scoring 1,002 runs and averaging 91.09 {{in a very}} wet summer which led to difficult wickets to bat on. Wisden named {{him as one of}} its Cricketers of the Year, commenting that he had improved his style and <b>footwork.</b> That season, he only played 11 matches due to work commitments as a clerk with Barings Bank, for whom he had worked since qualifying as a solicitor. Despite his lack of practice, he scored hundreds in his first three matches and came top of the Surrey batting averages. He scored a century in the Gentlemen v Players match, which impressed influential observers at Lord's, and represented England in a trial match against The Rest. In this latter match, when Percy Chapman withdrew at the last minute, Jardine took over the captaincy, earning praise in the press for his performance. By this stage, he was considered a certainty to tour Australia the following winter.|$|E
50|$|Ali Adnan is {{somewhat}} the Iraqi Ian Harte, a left-back with a ferocious set piece. He {{is a tall}} and physical but fast player, which lends well to Iraq’s counter-attack philosophy, and to Turkish media, Ali Adnan {{is known as the}} new Gareth Bale or Asia's Gareth Bale. Ali Adnan is an attack-minded left back, possesses a strong physique and a powerful long-range shooting ability. Ali Adnan bursts from the back straight into the opposite half of the field with some sublime <b>footworks</b> propelling him to go past defenders and midfielders with ease. Always brimming with energy and full of athletism coupled with his unrivaled strength, opponents find it a tough task taming the wild and audacious left-back who is often than not, seen in the third half of the field entertaining viewers with dazzling skills and screamers from long ranges. Ali Adnan has still managed to stand out on account of his marauding runs down the left wing, as well as his useful habit of popping up with vitally important goals. In spite of his attacking prowess, Ali Adnan serves as a good pillar for his team when defending. With regard to his delivery crosses, overconfidence serves as his bane and falters on quite few occasions but looking at his tender age, with hard work he could overcome this and be a star to watch in the future.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to produce road profile model based on vertical displacement data from instrument walking profiler and road scanner that could be implemented in long term pavement performance model for predicting the dynamic loading of the vehicles tyre. Road profiles data was supplied by IKRAM Engineering, Malaysia. A vertical distance data from two roads, approximately 0. 8 km of new federal road and 5 km of state road were obtained. The International Roughness Index (1 RI) was used to classfi types of road based on the IRI classification. The IRI for each sample of road profile was computed using software named ProVal and <b>FOOTWORKs.</b> Road profile generating process was followed the theory Dodds and Robson and also Hardy and Cebon. The process was performed using MATLAB software. After generating road profiles, the calibration between reference and generated road profiles was performed by calculating the corelation coeffrcient value. The correlation coefficient value ranges between - 0. 7 to -l and 0. 7 to I is considered to have a similarity each other. As a results, for federal and state road, several models of road profiles were generated for each sample data. In conclusion, all the road profiles generated will be able to be used as an ahernative road profile in long term pavement performance analysis...|$|R
5000|$|At the start, Alesi got {{ahead of}} a {{sluggish}} Damon Hill and Senna {{tried to do the}} same, but there was contact between Hill and Senna, resulting in both drivers dropping back, with Senna ending up in 9th and Hill right behind him in 10th. Further back there was chaos. Due to the bunching effect the first sequence of chicanes at Monza tend to cause {{at the start of a}} race, there is always the risk of contact in the tightly packed midfield and on this occasion that is exactly what happened. Two separate incidents saw 5 cars eliminated at the first chicane. In the first incident, the <b>Footworks</b> of Derek Warwick and Aguri Suzuki collided and took each other out. In the second incident, Sauber driver JJ Lehto, who had to start from the back of the grid, was hoping to recover lost ground and proceeded to take himself and the Jordans of Rubens Barrichello and the debutant Marco Apicella out of the race. Apicella's debut, which would also turn out to be his only Grand Prix start, had lasted no more than 800 metres, unofficially making him the driver with one of the shortest careers in Formula One. Prost led Alesi, Schumacher, Berger, Herbert and Brundle into lap 2. On lap 4 Schumacher passed Alesi to take second position.|$|R
5|$|In {{the context}} of the {{commercial}} dance industry, hip-hop (or new style hip-hop for dancers in France and Japan) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it. From a technical aspect, it is characterized as hard-hitting involving flexibility and isolations—moving a specific body part independently from others. The feet are grounded, the chest is down, the posture is hunched, and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting the beat or moving through the beat. Like African dance, new style hip-hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of <b>footwork</b> and radial movement of the hips. In addition, emphasis is placed on musicality—how sensitive your movements are to the music—and being able to freestyle (improvise). As long as dancers keep the foundational movements, they can add their own (free)style and have a performance that is still hip-hop.|$|E
5|$|Jardine entered New College, Oxford, in September 1919 at a {{time when}} the {{university}} was more crowded than usual due to the arrival of men whose entrance had been delayed due to the war. He took part in several sports, representing New College as goalkeeper in matches between the colleges, and being given a trial for the University football team, although he was not chosen. He continued to play rackets and began to play real tennis, making such progress and showing such promise that he went on to represent the University successfully and won his Blue. In cricket, Jardine came under the coaching of Tom Hayward who influenced his <b>footwork</b> and defence. Wisden commented in 1928 that Jardine had come with an excellent reputation, but did not quite achieve the success which was expected. His batting ability, particularly defensively, remained unquestioned.|$|E
5|$|On {{the return}} to Australia, the team stopped on the Indian subcontinent to play their first Tests on Pakistani and Indian soil respectively. In a short tour, the four Tests were the only fixtures. Harvey failed to pass double figures in a one off Test against Pakistan in Karachi, the first between the two countries. Moving to India, he scored 140 in the drawn Second Test in Bombay, scoring runs all around the ground. Due to {{injuries}} and illness {{to many of the}} bowlers, the Australians were unable to dismiss their hosts twice. In the final match, Australia were in trouble after taking a 41-run first innings lead. In the second innings they were struggling on a sticky wicket caused by flooding, but made 69 out of 9/189 in the low-scoring Third Test in Calcutta to help Australia to a 2–0 series win. He ended with 253 runs at 63.25 for the series. His performances on the subcontinent were marked by his aggressive <b>footwork</b> in moving down to meet the pitch of the ball. After seven months away, the Australians returned home.|$|E
50|$|On new tyres, Hill {{began to}} reduce Schumacher's nine-second lead, {{but after a}} few laps Schumacher began to ease away again as he had a lighter fuel load than the Williams. It became {{apparent}} to the teams, as the race approached half-distance, that Schumacher had opted for a one-stop strategy and that both he and Hill only had one stop remaining each. Frentzen, Papis and the Minardi drivers also opted for a single-stop race; Papis and Martini's worn tyres allowing Panis to overtake them soon after his second stop. Papis made his first Formula One race pit stop on lap 28, only to hit the barrier at the exit of the pit lane, causing damage to his <b>Footwork's</b> suspension which caused him to spin off and retire on the same lap that he rejoined the circuit. On the next lap Frentzen dropped from sixth to eighth position {{as a result of his}} sole stop, and was then passed by Panis four laps later; Martini likewise dropped from 10th to 13th on lap 30; and Badoer also moved from 10th to 13th when he made his stop on lap 32. At the front of the field, Hill moved back into the lead of the race when Schumacher made his pit stop on lap 31, rejoining in second place with a deficit of 20 seconds. Hill now pushed hard in his efforts to build up a sufficient lead over Schumacher—setting the race's fastest lap time of 1:29.752 on lap 37—to maintain first place after his second pit stop. Salo began the second round of pit stops on the next lap, and was followed in due course by Alesi, Herbert, Barrichello, Boullion, Gachot, Blundell, Panis and Coulthard. Coulthard's stop, despite moving him ahead of Alesi, was problematic: his car's electronic failure meant that his pit-lane speed-limiter system did not work, and he exceeded the 80 km/h pit-lane speed limit, an infraction of the Sporting Regulations which, like jumping the start, entailed a ten-second stop-go penalty. Hill made his own second stop on lap 41 with a 27-second lead over Schumacher and the two were almost level as Hill reached the end of the pit lane, but Schumacher's extra momentum allowed him to move ahead in the run to the Maggotts, Becketts and Chapel sequence of fast corners. At the completion of the scheduled pit stops by lap 44, the running order was Schumacher and Hill in close attendance, then a gap back to a similar battle between Herbert and Coulthard, then Alesi, Blundell, Barrichello, Panis, Frentzen—whom Panis had just passed for the third time—Martini, Badoer, Salo, Boullion, Gachot and Moreno, the last of whom retired four laps later with a lack of hydraulic pressure in his Forti's pneumatic engine valves.|$|R
5|$|The {{diminutive}} Hassett was {{an elegant}} middle-order batsman, {{known for his}} wide range of strokes, timing, quick <b>footwork</b> and strong wrists. However, as his career progressed and his seniority in the Australian team increased, he became a more cautious player who often frustrated spectators with sedate scoring, particularly after World War II. Despite this, Hassett remained an aggressive and adventurous strokemaker in matches for Victoria. He had a poker face, and this benefited him as a captain, as even his teammates sometimes {{found it hard to}} discern his mood or thinking. During his 24 Test matches in charge, he won 14 games and suffered defeat only four times, but it was the last of the four losses that blighted his record. Hassett was a very occasional right-arm medium pace bowler, averaging one over per first-class match. He took 18 wickets in 216 matches, and never took more than two in a single innings. He never took a wicket at Test level and bowled less than 19 overs.|$|E
5|$|Wisden {{believed}} that Jardine's effective batting technique meant that fast bowlers troubled him less than other batsmen. He did have difficulties {{with a few}} bowlers. Alec Kennedy, a medium paced inswing bowler, took Jardine's wicket eleven times, eight of these occasions before the batsman had scored 20 runs. Kennedy found that Jardine had slightly slow <b>footwork,</b> often bowling him or trapping him lbw. Bert Ironmonger also troubled Jardine, taking his wicket {{in five of the}} eleven Test innings in which they faced each other. Jardine displayed a slight weakness against Australian slow bowlers, not moving his feet well enough against them. In 16 Test innings in Australia, he was out to slow bowlers ten times, but he rarely experienced similar difficulties against English spinners. One other bowler to cause Jardine problems was the Australian paceman Tim Wall, who took his wicket five times on the nine occasions he bowled to him.|$|E
