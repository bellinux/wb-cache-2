40|$|To better {{understand}} how to structure interdisciplinary education, {{there is a need}} to study and learn from programmes at all levels in the academic system. While considerable effort has been devoted into examining bachelor’s and master’s programmes, the challenges and rewards of doctoral programmes receive less attention. In this chapter, we present the LUCID Ph. D. research school as an example of an international, interdisciplinary programme that integrates social and natural dimensions of sustainability. First, we introduce the programme’s aims and structure. We then present the main activities to facilitate student interaction over its initial seven years of operation including a common and integrated working environment, course offerings, co-authorship, and a range of the different interdisciplinary courses, seminars and workshops that exist. Subsequently, we present and discuss the difficulties relating to the process to initiate, maintain, and improve a competitive international and interdisciplinary programme, covering the challenges of dual departmental affiliation for Ph. D. candidates, interdisciplinary knowledge production and publishing, and the ambition to foster a diverse, open and inclusive educational environment. The main message is that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>an</b> academic <b>village,</b> <b>an</b> extended group of dedicated and reflexive staff at different levels and departments, working together in a variety of cooperative research and education processes to develop an interdisciplinary Ph. D. programme and educate the first generations of sustainability scientists...|$|R
40|$|In Shifting Standards, Allan Franklin {{provides}} an overview of notable experiments in particle physics. Using papers published in Physical Review, the journal of the American Physical Society, as his basis, Franklin details the experiments themselves, their data collection, the events witnessed, and the interpretation of results. From these papers, he distills the dramatic changes to particle physics experimentation from 1894 through 2009. Franklin develops a framework for his analysis, viewing each example according to exclusion and selection of data; possible experimenter bias; details of the experimental apparatus; size of the data set, apparatus, and number of authors; rates of data taking along with analysis and reduction; distinction between ideal and actual experiments; historical accounts of previous experiments; and personal comments and style. From Millikan’s tabletop oil-drop experiment to the Compact Muon Solenoid apparatus measuring approximately 4, 000 cubic meters (not including accelerators) and employing over 2, 000 authors, Franklin’s study follows the decade-by-decade evolution of scale and standards in particle physics experimentation. As he shows, where once there were only one or two collaborators, now <b>it</b> literally <b>takes</b> <b>a</b> <b>village.</b> Similar changes are seen in data collection: in 1909 Millikan’s data set took 175 oil drops, of which he used 23 to determine the value of e, the charge of the electron; in contrast, the 1988 – 1992 E 791 experiment using the Collider Detector at Fermilab, investigating the hadroproduction of charm quarks, recorded 20 billion events. As we also see, data collection <b>took</b> <b>a</b> quantum leap in the 1950 s with the use of computers. Events are now recorded at rates as of a few hundred per second, and analysis rates have progressed similarly. Employing his epistemology of experimentation, Franklin deconstructs each example to view the arguments offered and the correctness of the results. Overall, he finds that despite the metamorphosis of the process, the role of experimentation has remained remarkably consistent through the years: to test theories and provide factual basis for scientific knowledge, to encourage new theories, and to reveal new phenomenon...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} describes and {{analyzes the}} experiences of children and staff in “A Children 2 ̆ 7 s Village”. From 1993 through 1997, this pilot project—sponsored by the North East School District—operated as a school within a school. The location is in a large urban setting. ^ The intent was to simulate aspects of <b>an</b> African <b>village</b> within <b>an</b> educational setting. In-depth information is provided on the physical, interpersonal, and institutional aspects of African Village life. ^ Central to the study lies the question, “What happens when African Americans choose a distinctive pedagogy for African American students?” Clearly, the disproportionate number of African American students being labeled learning disabled and at-risk for failure {{gives rise to the}} latter question. Moreover, the broader concern for African American students is one of bi-culturality. For instance, survival in America requires that these students negotiate simultaneously within the Black community and the broader American society. Consequently, the societal and institutional context within which students live and learn were examined. Emphatically, <b>it</b> does <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>village</b> to educate <b>a</b> child. Therefore, the Village environment was the most significant variable examined within this study. ^ Ethnography, an interpretative approach relying on sustained participant observation and informal interviewing, was employed as a means of studying everyday lives and values of Village participants. Audiotapes, videotapes and fieldnotes were used in the collection of data. The participants included a total of four teachers, 150 students and their parents. The study broadens present research in this area by providing a rich description of actual classroom practices. The study also reveals the following: (1) African American parents truly desire continuity of values and belief systems between home and school; (2) African American families are intimately involved in the educational lives of their children; (3) Educational practices, perfected within Independent Black Institutions, worked in the past and continue to work now; (4) and Shared ethnicity between the teacher and student encourages the African American educator to operate within multiple roles, such as: advocate, nurturer, instructor and admonisher. These multiple roles create a distinctive avenue to academic enrichment. ...|$|R
40|$|In {{animals that}} breed cooperatively, adult {{individuals}} will sometimes delay reproduction {{to act as}} helpers at the nest who raise young that are not their genetic offspring. It has been proposed that humans are also a cooperatively breeding species because older daughters, grandmothers, and other kin and nonkin may provide significant childcare. Through a prospective cohort study of children's (n = 1, 700) growth and survival in the Dogon of Mali, I show that cooperative breeding theory is a poor fit to the family dynamics of this population. Rather than helping each other, siblings competed for resources, producing a tradeoff {{between the number of}} maternal siblings and growth and survival. <b>It</b> did not <b>take</b> <b>a</b> <b>village</b> to raise <b>a</b> child; children fared the same in nuclear as in extended families. Of critical importance was the degree of polygyny, which created conflicts associated with asymmetries in genetic relatedness. The risk of death was higher and the rate of growth was slower in polygynous than monogamous families. The hazard of death for Dogon children was twofold higher if the resident paternal grandmother was alive rather than dead. This finding may reflect the frailty of elderly grandmothers who become net consumers rather than net producers in this resource-poor society. Mothers were of overwhelming importance for child survival and could not be substituted by any category of kin or nonkin. The idea of cooperative breeding taken from animal studies is a poor fit to the complexity and diversity of kin interactions in humans...|$|R

40|$|The essays {{collected}} in Women Writing Women: The Frontiers Reader weave together theoretical, personal, and material frameworks feminist scholars use {{to write about}} their lives {{and the lives of}} other women. The essays, organized centrifugally (2 ̆ 2 Writing the Self 2 ̆ 2 to 2 ̆ 2 Writing Women from a Distance 2 ̆ 2), were selected by the editors from essays published originally in Frontiers: A Journal of Women Studies. Like the journal, Women Writing Women is multidisciplinary, theoretically informed, and, above all, grounded in the lived experiences of diverse women. Explaining the cohesiveness of the anthology in their introduction, editors Hart, Weathermon, and Armitage insist that the 2 ̆ 2 diversity of women 2 ̆ 7 s experience cannot be overstated, and it is to this splendid and complex reality that this collection is selected and dedicated. 2 ̆ 2 2 ̆ 2 Splendid and complex 2 ̆ 2 also describes the tone of the anthology: the essays are largely beautifully written and clearly argued. In moving prose, contributors persistently exemplify the joyous peril of writing about women, and in so doing urge the reader to consider her footing at various personal, theoretical, and political crossroads. The Great Plains scholar will find pointed examinations of identity, gender, and social realties in a regional context: economic dependence in small-town Idaho; Cherokee family history in Oklahoma; relationships between truth and memory in a western mining community; women 2 ̆ 7 s migration, immigration, and diaspora in the West; and poignant evocations of mothering, writing, and laboring throughout the region. What emerges, however, is not a traditional interrogation of how region affects identity, but rather an investigation of how global feminism can serve to uncover the complex relationship between social/physical space and women 2 ̆ 7 s lives. In 2 ̆ 2 Weave and Mend, 2 ̆ 2 for example, contributor Joanne B. Mulcahy relates how underclass Irish women use storytelling to come to authority and challenge 2 ̆ 2 official 2 ̆ 2 history-much the same way Great Plains women have added their voices to the public record of the American frontier. Nancy Reincke details the relationship between her working-class Idaho mother, Filipina maids abroad, and her own academic labor in her essay 2 ̆ 2 <b>It</b> <b>Takes</b> <b>a</b> Global <b>Village</b> to Raise Consciousness. 2 ̆ 2 Reincke demonstrates her discovery of 2 ̆ 2 the relations that tie us all together in global networks of interdependence. 2 ̆ 2 Valerie Grim 2 ̆ 7 s 2 ̆ 2 From the Yazoo Mississippi Delta to the Urban Communities of the Midwest 2 ̆ 2 uses African American women 2 ̆ 7 s oral histories to detail black women 2 ̆ 7 s experiences of migration and change.
