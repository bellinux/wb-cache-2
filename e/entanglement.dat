5|$|A {{second major}} cause of {{morbidity}} and mortality in the North Atlantic right whale is <b>entanglement</b> in fishing gear. Right whales ingest plankton with wide-open mouths, risking <b>entanglement</b> in any rope or net fixed in the water column. Rope wraps around their upper jaws, flippers and tails. Some are able to escape, but others remain tangled. Whales can be successfully disentangled, if observed and aided. In July 1997, the U.S. NOAA introduced the Atlantic Large Whale Take Reduction Plan, which seeks to minimize whale <b>entanglement</b> in fishing gear and record large whale sightings in an attempt to estimate numbers and distribution.|$|E
5|$|<b>Entanglement</b> {{can result}} in {{mortality}} because when the seals get trapped in marine debris such as fishing nets they cannot maneuver or reach the surface to breathe. Marine fisheries can potentially interact with monk seals via direct and indirect relationships. Directly the seal can become snared by fishing equipment, entangled in discarded debris, and even feed on fish refuse. International law prohibits the intentional discarding of debris from ships at sea. Monk seals {{have one of the}} highest documented rates of <b>entanglement</b> of any pinniped species.|$|E

40|$|In Automated Planning, {{learning}} and exploiting structural patterns of plans, domain models and/or problem models, {{in order to}} improve plan generation speed-up and increase the scope of problems solved, has attracted much research. Reformulation techniques such as those based on macro-operators or <b>entanglements</b> are very promising, mainly because they are planner independent. This paper aims to extend and revisit the recent work on inner <b>entanglements,</b> relations between pairs of planning operators and predicates encapsulating exclusivity of predicate ‘achievements‘ or ‘requirements’, in order to bring new theoretical results (PSPACE completeness of deciding inner <b>entanglements),</b> present a new way of encoding of inner <b>entanglements</b> and empirical comparison between different kinds of inner <b>entanglements...</b>|$|R
40|$|We {{review the}} {{progress}} in the last 20 – 30 years, during which we discovered {{that there are many}} new phases of matter that are beyond the traditional Landau symmetry breaking theory. We discuss new “topological” phenomena, such as topological degeneracy that reveals the existence of those new phases—topologically ordered phases. Just like zero viscosity defines the superfluid order, the new “topological” phenomena define the topological order at macroscopic level. More recently, we found that at the microscopical level, topological order is due to long-range quantum <b>entanglements.</b> Long-range quantum <b>entanglements</b> lead to many amazing emergent phenomena, such as fractional charges and fractional statistics. Long-range quantum <b>entanglements</b> can even provide a unified origin of light and electrons; light is a fluctuation of long-range <b>entanglements,</b> and electrons are defects in long-range <b>entanglements...</b>|$|R

5|$|By-catch is the {{incidental}} {{capture of}} non-target species in fisheries. Fixed and drift gill nets cause the highest mortality levels for both cetaceans and pinnipeds, however, entanglements in long lines, mid-water trawls, and both trap and pot lines are also common. Tuna seines are particularly problematic for <b>entanglement</b> by dolphins. By-catch affects all cetaceans, both small and big, in all habitat types. However, smaller cetaceans and pinnipeds {{are most vulnerable}} as their size means that escape once they are entangled is highly unlikely and they frequently drown. While larger cetaceans are capable of dragging nets with them, the nets sometimes remain tightly attached to the individual and can impede the animal from feeding sometimes leading to starvation. Abandoned or lost nets and lines cause mortality through ingestion or <b>entanglement.</b> Marine mammals also get entangled in aquaculture nets, however, these are rare events and not prevalent enough to impact populations.|$|E
5|$|Like {{other large}} whales, the {{humpback}} was {{a target for}} the whaling industry. Once hunted {{to the brink of}} extinction, its population fell by an estimated 90% before a 1966 moratorium. While stocks have partially recovered, <b>entanglement</b> in fishing gear, collisions with ships and noise pollution continue to impact the population of 80,000.|$|E
5|$|Manta {{rays are}} subject to other {{anthropogenic}} threats. Because mantas must swim constantly to flush oxygen-rich water over their gills, they are vulnerable to <b>entanglement</b> and subsequent suffocation. Mantas cannot swim backwards and, because of their protruding cephalic fins, are prone to <b>entanglement</b> in fishing lines, nets, and even loose mooring lines. When snared, mantas often attempt to free themselves by somersaulting, tangling themselves further. Loose, trailing line can wrap around and cut its way into its flesh, resulting in irreversible injury. Similarly, mantas become entangled in gill nets designed for smaller fish. Some mantas are injured by collision with boats, especially in areas where they congregate and are easily observed. Other threats or factors that may affect manta numbers are climate change, tourism, pollution from oil spills, and the ingestion of microplastics.|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the results of an {{investigation}} on the influence of chain <b>entanglements</b> and cross-links in ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE), on the crystallization behaviour of the bulk polymer, and on the material properties of highly oriented gel-spun hot-drawn UHMWPE fibres. The average chain length between <b>entanglements</b> in linear polyethylene is about 18 nm, a distance comparable to the fold-length of the lamellae in crystallized polyethylene. The <b>entanglements</b> move to the fold surface upon crystallization, because they cannot be incorporated inside the crystal-lattice due to their dimensions. Because of this, the high concentration of <b>entanglements</b> has almost no influence on the melting temperature of the lamellae. [...] . Zie: Summary...|$|R

5|$|The Lemon {{test has}} been criticized by justices and legal scholars, but it remains the {{predominant}} {{means by which the}} Court enforces the Establishment Clause. In Agostini v. Felton (1997), the <b>entanglement</b> prong of the Lemon test was demoted to simply being a factor in determining the effect of the challenged statute or practice. In Zelman v. Simmons-Harris (2002), the opinion of the Court considered secular purpose and the absence of primary effect; a concurring opinion saw both cases as having treated <b>entanglement</b> as part of the primary purpose test. Further tests, such as the endorsement test and coercion test, have been developed to determine whether a government action violated the Establishment Clause.|$|E

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that physical <b>entanglements</b> {{are essential to}} explain some mechanical properties of polymers, like viscoelasticity. The current view is that <b>entanglements</b> behave as dynamic links that are destroyed and created in time. It is less clear whether <b>entanglements</b> could alternatively produce local and stable links, with similar effects to chemical bonds. Here we show that local and stable <b>entanglements,</b> that we call physical pseudo-knots, exist and are formed with high probability in helical structures. The energies required to create and destroy physical pseudo-knots can differ {{by at least one}} order of magnitude. Together with their localized nature this makes them controllable, opening the possibility {{for a wide range of}} applications in material science, nano- and biotechnology.
