40|$|AbstractActin {{filaments}} have {{key roles}} in cell motility but are generally {{claimed to be}} passive interaction partners in actin-myosin-based motion generation. Here, we present evidence against this static view based on an altered myosin-induced actin filament gliding pattern in an in vitro motility assay at varied [MgATP]. The statistics that characterize the degree of meandering of the actin <b>filament</b> <b>paths</b> suggest that for [MgATP] ≥ 0. 25  mM, the flexural rigidity of heavy meromyosin (HMM) -propelled actin filaments is similar (without phalloidin) or slightly lower (with phalloidin) than that of HMM-free filaments observed in solution without surface tethering. When [MgATP] was reduced to ≤ 0. 1  mM, the actin <b>filament</b> <b>paths</b> in the in vitro motility assay became appreciably more winding in both the presence and absence of phalloidin. This effect of lowered [MgATP] was qualitatively different from that seen when HMM was mixed with ATP-insensitive, N-ethylmaleimide-treated HMM (NEM-HMM; 25 – 30 %). In particular, the addition of NEM-HMM increased a non-Gaussian tail in the path curvature distribution {{as well as the}} number of events in which different parts of an actin <b>filament</b> followed different <b>paths.</b> These effects were the opposite of those observed with reduced [MgATP]. Theoretical modeling suggests a 30 – 40 % lowered flexural rigidity of the actin filaments at [MgATP] ≤ 0. 1  mM and local bending of the filament front upon each myosin head attachment. Overall, the results fit with appreciable structural changes in the actin filament during actomyosin-based motion generation, and modulation of the actin filament mechanical properties by the dominating chemomechanical actomyosin state...|$|R

We have investigated Cu/CuxO/Ag capacitor-like structure which exhibits bipolar resistive switching behavior under low-range direct current sweep in the temperature range from 255 K to 355 K. Ink-jet printing technology is used to fabricate the device. The device displays a resistive switching ratio of more than 30 between high resistance state and low resistance state at room temperature. The device displays a resistive switching ratio of more than 20 between HRS and LRS over 100 cycles. Memory states are reproducible and remained over 500 times.

The good ductility of printed silver and electroplated copper electrodes and simple cross-point structure of the memory cell result in good flexibility and mechanical robustness, which indicates great potential for future flexible memory applications.

In an effort to better understand the mechanism by which guidance occurs, we present a quantitative measure of the transport efficiency of microtubules along straight polyurethane channels 1 mum deep.

We identify microtubule-sidewall collisions as the key event for microtubule escape from a channel and thus the determinant of guiding efficiency. To better understand the relationship between collisions and travel distance, we determine the effect of channel width on (1) the microtubule approach angle to the sidewall, (2) the collision outcome (guided or escaped), and (3) the distance traveled between collisions.

40|$|We present {{observations}} and magnetic field modeling {{of the large}} polar crown prominence that erupted on 2010 December 6. Combination of SDO/AIA and STEREO_Behind/EUVI allows {{us to see the}} fine structures of this prominence both at the limb and on the disk. We focus on the structures and dynamics of this prominence before the eruption. This prominence contains two parts: an active region part containing mainly horizontal threads, and a quiet Sun part containing mainly vertical threads. On the northern side of the prominence channel, both AIA and EUVI observe bright features which appear to be the lower legs of loops that go above then join in the filament. Filament materials are observed to frequently eject horizontally from the active region part to the quiet Sun part. This ejection results in the formation of a dense-column structure (concentration of dark vertical threads) near the border between the active region and the quiet Sun. Using the flux rope insertion method, we create non-linear force-free field models based on SDO/HMI line-of-sight magnetograms. A key feature of these models is that the flux rope has connections with the surroundings photosphere, so its axial flux varies along the <b>filament</b> <b>path.</b> The height and location of the dips of field lines in our models roughly replicate those of the observed prominence. Comparison between model and observations suggests that the bright features on the northern side of the channel are the lower legs of the field lines that turn into the flux rope. We suggest that plasma may be injected into the prominence along these field lines. Although the models fit the observations quiet well, there are also some interesting differences. For example, the models do not reproduce the observed vertical threads and cannot explain the formation of the dense-column structure.

40|$|Aims An {{intriguing}} {{difference between}} vertebrate skeletal and cardiac muscles {{is that the}} lengths of the thin filaments are constant in the former but variable in the latter. The thick filaments have constant lengths in both types of muscles. The contractile behaviour of a muscle {{is affected by the}} lengths of both types of filaments as the tension generated during contraction depends on the amount of filament overlap. To understand the behaviour of cardiac muscle, {{it is important to know}} the distribution of the thin filament lengths. The previous detailed analysis by Robinson and Winegrad used serial transverse sections to determine the lengths of the thin filaments. However, the precision, set by the 100 nm section thickness, was low. Here, we have used electron tomography to produce 3 D images of rat and mouse cardiac muscles in which we can actually see individual thin filaments up to the free ends and see that these free ends have variable locations. For comparison, we also measure the thin filament lengths in skeletal muscle (frog sartorius). Methods and results Cardiac papillary muscles were obtained from a rat (Sprague–Dawley) and a mouse (C 57 /B 6). Skeletal muscle (sartorius) was obtained from a frog (Rana pipiens). Longitudinal sections (100 nm thick) were used to produce tilt series and tomograms from which the thin <b>filament</b> <b>paths</b> were traced. Cardiac papillary muscle thin filaments in rat and mouse range from 0. 94 to 1. 10 mm, with a mean length of 1. 04 mm and standard deviation of 0. 03 mm. For frog sartorius muscle, the thin filament length was 0. 94 mm with standard deviation of 0. 01 mm.

The conduction path can arise from different mechanisms, including vacancy or metal defect migration. Once the filament is formed, it may be reset (broken, resulting in high resistance) or set (re-formed, resulting in lower resistance) by another voltage. Many current paths, rather than a single filament, are possibly involved. The presence of these current paths in the dielectric can be in situ demonstrated via conductive atomic force microscopy.|$|R

Transmission electron microscopy and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analyses revealed that the ZnO:Fe- 4 TP film contains more uniform grains and a higher density of oxygen vacancies, which promote the easier formation of conducting <b>filaments</b> along similar <b>paths</b> and the stability of switching parameters.

40|$|We use {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} turbulent cluster-forming regions {{to study the}} nature of dense filamentary structures in star formation. Using four hydrodynamic and magnetohydrodynamic simulations chosen to match observations, we identify filaments in the resulting column density maps and analyze their properties. We calculate the radial column density profiles of the filaments every 0. 05 Myr and fit the profiles with the modified isothermal and pressure confined isothermal cylinder models, finding reasonable fits for either model. The filaments formed in the simulations have similar radial column density profiles to those observed. Magnetic fields provide additional pressure support to the filaments, making `puffier' filaments less prone to fragmentation than in the pure hydrodynamic case, which continue to condense at a slower rate. In the higher density simulations, the filaments grow faster through the increased importance of gravity. Not all of the filaments identified in the simulations will evolve to form stars: some expand and disperse. Given these different <b>filament</b> evolutionary <b>paths,</b> the trends in bulk filament width {{as a function of}} time, magnetic field strength, or density, are weak, and all cases are reasonably consistent with the finding of a constant filament width in different star-forming regions. In the simulations, the mean FWHM lies between 0. 06 and 0. 26 pc for all times and initial conditions, with most lying between 0. 1 to 0. 15 pc; the range in FWHMs are, however, larger than seen in typical Herschel analyses. Finally, the filaments display a wealth of substructure similar to the recent discovery of filament bundles in Taurus. Comment: 18 pages, 8 figures, 7 tables. Accepted for publication in Ap...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Filament wound {{structures}} such as pressure tanks, {{pipes and}} motor cases of rockets are widely used in aerospace applications. The determination of a proper winding angle and thickness {{is very important to}} decrease manufacturing difficulties and to increase structural efficiency. In this study, possible winding angles considering the slippage between a fiber and a mandrel surface are calculated using the semi-geodesic path equation. In addition, finite element analyses using ABAQUS are performed to predict the behavior of filament wound structures considering continuous change of the winding angle and thickness at the dome part due to fiber built-up near the metallic boss. Water-pressuring tests of a third stage motor case are performed to verify the analysis procedure. The strain gages are attached on the surface in the fiber direction. Progressive failure analysis predicted the burst pressure a little bit higher than the experiment and the weakest region of the motor case very well. The effect of reinforcement is also studied to increase its performance.

40|$|UnrestrictedThe {{conditions}} in the solar interior are so extreme that it {{has so far been}} impossible to match them in a laboratory. However, for nearly 50 years solar oscillations have been precisely observed, and the wealth of their data has enabled us to study the interior of the Sun {{as if it were a}} laboratory. Helioseismology is the name of this branch of astrophysics. It allows a high-precision diagnostic of the thermodynamic quantities in the solar interior. High-quality thermodynamic quantities are crucial for successful solar modeling.; If good solar models are desired, considerable theoretical effort is required. Good solar models, in turn, are fundamental tools for solar physics. The most prominent example of this link between solar physics and basic physics was the resolution of the solar neutrino problem in 2002. The equation of state is a key material property that describes the relation between pressure, density and temperature. If the equation of state is derived from a thermodynamic potential it will also determine all associated thermodynamic quantities. A second key material property is the nuclear-energy production rate, which plays a crucial role in the solar core. Both are important physical properties describing the structure of the Sun. Both derive from microphysical models.; In the equation-of-state part, we have studied two models of the equation of state (EOS). One is the MHD EOS, which is widely used in solar models. In our research, we have incorporated new terms into the MHD EOS. These terms have been borrowed from the major competing formalism, the OPAL EOS. They were missing in the original MHD EOS. Not only do the upgrades bring MHD closer to the OPAL equation of state, which is well known for its better match with observations. Most importantly it will allow solar modelers to use the OPAL equation of state directly, without recourse to the OPAL tables distributed by the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Since the OPAL code is not publicly available, there is no alternative source. The official OPAL tables, however, have disadvantages. First, they are inflexible regarding the chemical mix, which is set once and for all by the producers of the tables. Our equation of state will allow the user to choose, in principle, an arbitrary mix. Second, the OPAL tables by their very nature are limited by the errors of interpolation within tables. The second equation of state model is a density expansion based on the Feynman-Kac path-integral formalism. By making use of the equivalence of quantum Hamiltonian matrix and the classical action of closed and open <b>filaments</b> (<b>paths),</b> an analytic formalism of equation of state. Although the character of density expansion limits its application, the formalism can still be valid in most region in the Sun. Our work provides the link between the abstract theoretical formalism that was developed in the 1990 s and a numerically smooth realization that can be used in solar and stellar models. Since it is so far the most exact and systematic approach for an EOS, it provides another way to study the influence of different very fine physical effects, despite considerable limitations in its domain of applicability.; In the nuclear-reaction part of the thesis, we have used a molecular-dynamics method to simulate the motion of protons in a hydrogen plasma (which is a good approximation for this purpose). Quantum tunneling explains why nuclear fusion can occur in the first place, considering the "low" temperature in the solar core. It is well known that this tunneling is enhanced (which leads to higher nuclear reaction rates) in the presence of Coulomb screening. In the 1950, Salpeter formulated a theory based on the static-screened Coulomb potential, as derived by Debye and Huckel in the 1920 s. As expected, Salpeter obtained enhanced reaction rates. But from our simulation, we confirmed the results of a recent controversy about the existence of a dynamic effect. Since the bulk of fusion reactions happens at the high end of the Maxwell distribution, this is an relevant issue. Our work is the first independent confirmation of such a dynamic effect...|$|R
40|$|AbstractRhodamine–phalloidin-labeled actin {{filaments}} were visualized gliding over a skeletal heavy meromyosin (HMM) -coated surface. Experiments at low filament densities {{showed that}} when two <b>filaments</b> collided, their <b>paths</b> were affected {{in a manner}} that depended on collision angle. Some collisions resulted in complete alignment of the filament paths; in others, the filaments crossed over one another. Filament crossover or alignment was equally probable at ∼ 40 ° contact angle. Filaments often underwent significant bending during collision and analysis of filament shape indicated an energy requirement of ∼ 13 kBT. Experiments were performed over a wide range of HMM surface density and actin filament bulk concentration. Actin filament gliding speed and path persistence plateaued above a critical HMM surface density, and at high (micromolar) actin filament concentrations, filament motion became dramatically aligned in a common direction. Spatiotemporal features of alignment behavior were determined by correlation analysis, supported by simulations. The thermal drift of individual filament tracks was suppressed as the population became more oriented. Spatial correlation analysis revealed that long-range alignment was due to incremental recruitment rather than fusion of locally ordered seed domains. The global alignment of filament movement, described by an “order parameter,” peaked at optimal actin concentrations and myosin surface densities, in contrast to previous predictions of a critical phase transition. Either hydrodynamic coupling or exchange of filaments between the surface bound and adjacent bulk phase layers might degrade order at high actin filament concentration, and high HMM surface densities might decrease alignment probability during collisions. Our results are compatible with generation of long-range order from mechanical interaction between individual actin filaments. Furthermore, we show that randomly oriented myosin motors align relatively short, submicrometer actin filaments into motile surface domains that extend over many tens of micrometers and these patterns persist for several minutes...|$|R
40|$|The {{details of}} a new {{fixation}} procedure using 40 per cent osmium tetroxide in carbon tetrachloride are presented. This fixative is a good general preservative, gives a higher contrast than the ordinary osmium fixatives, and may also preserve structures that are not otherwise readily revealed. Some possible reasons for the increased contrast are discussed. Micrographs of the sea urchin spermatozoa treated with the new fixative provide more detailed information on the tail structure than has heretofore been obtainable. This information is summarized in the diagrammatic text-figure. The sperm tail {{can no longer be}} regarded as having a bilateral symmetry, and thus, it is possible to assign an index number to each of the nine peripheral filaments. The nine peripheral filaments have a complex morphology, each one of them seems to be composed of two subunits that have unequal diameters. The slightly larger subunits are all found in the clockwise direction with regard to the other subunit or are all found in the counter-clockwise direction in the sectioned tail. Each of the slightly larger subunits is at intervals provided with two types of projections—referred to as the arms and the spokes—that extend in respective tangential and radial direction. The arms from one filament may be in actual contact with its neighboring filament through a complex bridge-like formation. There is a quantitative difference between the nine filaments with regard to this bridge. It is assumed that the eleven tail <b>filaments</b> follow straight <b>paths.</b> Some hypotheses on sperm movement are discussed based on this assumption and {{on the fact that the}} oscillations of an actively working sperm tail are in one plane. Probably, the nine peripheral filaments have non-equivalent functions in tail movement. In the centriole the nine peripheral filaments characteristically appear as triplets in a whorl-like arrangement. It is suggested that the inner part of this triplet is a derivation of the arms. A structural abnormality of the tail is described that is characterized by two or three complete sets of tail filaments within one cell membrane...|$|R
40|$|Random Access Memory (RRAM) {{has emerged}} as a leading {{candidate}} for nonvolatile memory storage. RRAM devices typically consist of a metal/insulator/metal (MIM) structure and exhibit switching of the device resistivity state (low-to-high, highto- low) by application of electrical bias. It is now widely accepted that shunting and rupturing of local conductive <b>paths</b> (<b>filaments)</b> directly determines the resistance state. The size and composition of these filaments are very much an open question, but are usually attributed to high local concentrations of oxygen vacancies. Although there has been a huge body of research conducted in this field, the fundamental nature of the conductive path and basic switching/failure mechanisms are still under debate. This is largely {{due to a lack of}} structural analysis of existing filament size and composition in actual devices. Since the non-volatile nature and device reliability issues (i. e. retention and endurance) are directly related to the irreversible structural transformations in the device, microstructural characterization is essential for eventual commercialization of RRAM. In this study, I investigated oxygen vacancy defect dynamics under electric filed essential for resistive switching and aim to identify size, location, and chemical nature of the conductive filaments in RRAM devices by using a variety of devices and materials characterization methods: in situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM), highresolution TEM (HRTEM), scanning TEM (STEM) -electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS), electron holography, rapid thermal annealing (RTA), transient thermometry, and electro-thermal simulation. I adopt an in situ electrical biasing TEM technique to study microstructural changes occurring during resistive switching using a model TiO 2 -based RRAM device, and confirmed the device is switchable inside of the TEM column. I observed extension and contraction of 011 and 121 -type Wadsley defects, crystallographic shear faults, associated with resistive switching. More specifically, emission and adsorption of oxygen vacancies under different polarity of electrical biases at the fault bounding dislocations were identified. The motion of Wadsley defects was used to track oxygen vacancy migration under electric field. Also, the microstructural changes that occur when the device experiences low electric field (104 V/cm) was reported, akin to read disturb. Crossbar type RRAM device stacks consisting of TiN/a-HfAlOx/Hf/TiN were investigated to estimate filament size, filament temperature, and its chemical footprint using HRTEM, transient thermometry and numerical simulation. In each of the switched devices, a single crystallite 8 - 16 nm in size embedded in an amorphous HfAlOx matrix was found. The HfAlOx crystallization temperature (Tc) of 850 K was determined by combining RTA and HRTEM imaging. In parallel, the filament size has been determined by transient thermometry. The temperature profile extracted from these measurements suggested that the peak filament temperature was 3 ̆e 1500 K at the center, with the hot zone (T 3 ̆e Tc = 850 K) extending to a radius of 7 nm around the filament. These results were consistent with the HRTEM observations of the crystallite size. The potential filament location (crystallite) in the switching devices was analyzed by STEM-EELS and identification of the filament chemical nature identification has been attempted...|$|R
30|$|Among them, {{emerging}} nonvolatile {{memories are}} now very captivating. The next-generation memory market will cover up these emerging memory technologies [21]. There are mainly five types of nonvolatile memory technology: Flash memory, ferroelectric random-access memory (FeRAM), magnetic random-access memory (MRAM), phase-change memory (PCM), and RRAM. Nonvolatile memory, specifically ‘Flash’ memory, which {{is characterized by}} a large-block (or ‘sector’) erasing mechanism, has been the fastest growing segment of the semiconductor business for the last 10  years. Some of these newer emerging technologies include MRAM, FeRAM, PCM, spin-transfer torque random-access memory (STT-RAM), RRAM and memristor. MRAM is a nonvolatile memory [10, 22]. Unlike DRAM, the data is not stored in an electric charge flow, but by magnetic storage elements. The storage elements are formed by two ferromagnetic plates, each of which can hold a magnetic field, separated by a thin insulating layer. One of the two plates is a permanent magnet set to a particular polarity; the other's field can be changed to match that of an external field to store memory. STT-RAM is an MRAM (nonvolatile) but with better scalability over traditional MRAM. The STT is an effect in which the orientation of a magnetic layer in a magnetic tunnel junction or spin valve can be modified using a spin-polarized current. Spin-transfer torque technology has the potential to make MRAM devices combining low current requirements and reduced cost possible; however, the amount of current needed to reorient the magnetization is at present too high for most commercial applications. PCM is a nonvolatile random-access memory, which is also called ovonic unified memory (OUM), based on reversible phase conversion between the amorphous and the crystalline state of a chalcogenide glass, which is accomplished by heating and cooling of the glass. It utilizes the unique behavior of chalcogenide (a material that has been used to manufacture CDs), whereby the heat produced by the passage of an electric current switches this material between two states. The different states have different electrical resistance which can be used to store data. The ideal memory device or the so-called unified memory would satisfy simultaneously three requirements: high speed, high density, and nonvolatility (retention). At the present time, such memory has not been developed. The floating gate nonvolatile semiconductor memory (NVSM) has high density and retention, but its program/erase speed is low. DRAM has high speed (approximately 10  ns) and high density, but it is volatile. On the other hand, SRAM has very high speed (approximately 5  ns) but limited from very low density and volatility. It is expected that PCM will have better scalability than other emerging technologies. RRAM is a nonvolatile memory that is similar to PCM. The technology concept is that a dielectric, which is normally insulating, can be made to conduct through a <b>filament</b> or conduction <b>path</b> formed after application of a sufficiently high voltage. Arguably, this is a memristor technology and should be considered as potentially a strong candidate to challenge NAND Flash. Currently, FRAM, MRAM, and PCM are in commercial production but still, relative to DRAM and NAND Flash, remain limited to niche applications. There is a view that MRAM, STT-RAM, and RRAM are the most promising emerging technologies, but they are still many years away from competing for industry adoption [23]. Any new technology must be able to deliver most, if not all, of the following attributes in order to drive industry adoption on a mass scale: scalability of the technology, speed of the device, and power consumption to be better than existing memories. The NVSM is in inspiring search of novel nonvolatile memories, which will successfully lead to the realization and commercialization of the unified memory.|$|R
