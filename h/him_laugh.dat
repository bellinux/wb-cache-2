25|$|Meanwhile, in 1772, English {{scientist}} Joseph Priestley {{discovered the}} gas nitrous oxide. Initially, people thought this gas to be lethal, even in small doses, like some other nitrogen oxides. However, in 1799, British chemist and inventor Humphry Davy {{decided to find}} out by experimenting on himself. To his astonishment he found that nitrous oxide made <b>him</b> <b>laugh,</b> so he nicknamed it laughing gas. Davy wrote about the potential anesthetic properties of nitrous oxide, but nobody at that time pursued the matter any further.|$|E

500|$|The Kinks' Dave Davies {{has claimed}} to dislike Van Halen's {{rendition}} of the song, saying [...] "There's the thing: good art isn't always about having the comfiest technique. I shouldn't encourage him, but I'm sure Eddie Van Halen played better when he was drunk." [...] He also told of how a concert-goer approached him after a live show and congratulated him on performing a [...] "great cover of the Van Halen song."

500|$|In March 1937 Howard Hawks {{signed a}} {{contract}} at RKO for an adaptation of Rudyard Kipling's [...] "Gunga Din", which had been in pre-production since the previous fall. When RKO was unable to borrow Clark Gable, Spencer Tracy and Franchot Tone from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer for the film and the adaptation of [...] "Gunga Din" [...] was delayed, Hawks began {{looking for a new}} project. In April 1937 he read a short story by Hagar Wilde in Collier's magazine called [...] "Bringing Up Baby" [...] and immediately wanted to make a film from it, remembering that it made <b>him</b> <b>laugh</b> out loud. RKO bought the screen rights in June for $1,004, and Hawks worked briefly with Wilde on the film's treatment. Wilde's short story differed significantly from the film: David and Susan are engaged, he is not a scientist and there is no dinosaur, intercostal clavicle or museum. However, Susan gets a pet panther from her brother Mark to give to their Aunt Elizabeth; David and Susan must capture the panther in the Connecticut wilderness with the help of Baby's favorite song, [...] "I Can't Give You Anything but Love, Baby".|$|E

500|$|Philpot {{continued}} that {{moments like}} Will and his boss making out recalled the show's [...] "glory days", and Messing's trouble keeping {{a straight face}} [...] "brought back fond memories of Tim Conway cracking up Harvey Korman on The Carol Burnett Show." [...] Knoxville News Sentinels writer Terry Morrow also commented that the episode reminded him of The Carol Burnett Show because of its [...] "goofiness and by-the-seat-of-its-pants style." [...] Morrow added that the episode made <b>him</b> <b>laugh</b> {{more than any other}} sitcom on network television. Jeffrey Kauffman of DVD Talk praised Baldwin for his performance and commented that [...] "Alive and Schticking" [...] helped [...] "jumpstart the series creatively after a couple of seasons" [...] and [...] "It's fun [...] to see the actors momentarily break character, a la The Carol Burnett Show, where the absurdity of certain situations (usually involving Jack and/or Karen) makes giggling all but impossible." [...] Entertainment Weekly television critic Gary Susman gave [...] "Alive and Schticking" [...] four stars, while Frazier Moore of the Associated Press lauded it as a [...] "fun, and attention-grabbing, note." [...] The Hollywood Reporters Ray Richmond said [...] "In hindsight, this live thing proved a good idea." ...|$|E
500|$|The game's {{tone was}} praised by reviewers. Daniel Bischoff from Game Revolution praised the game's comedic {{elements}} describing them as [...] "contemporary". He {{added that the}} game {{is one of the}} rare few that made <b>him</b> <b>laugh</b> while playing. Sam Prell from Joystiq appreciated the humor, and thought that its quality was boosted by the performance of the voice-actors. His opinion was echoed by Peter Brown from GameSpot, who found the voice acting in the game entertaining and believable. However, Prell considered some humorous moments [...] "hit-or-miss". Andrew Reiner from Game Informer described the game as a [...] "full circle", in which Insomniac has incorporated all the elements from their previous game into this one. As a result, he thought that while the story emphasized comedy, it successfully reflected some pressing issues existing in society. Mollie L Patterson from Electronic Gaming Monthly appreciated the game's humor, but noted {{that it would not be}} able to satisfy every type of player. Arthur Gies from Polygon described the story as [...] "gleefully stupid", and commended the self-aware narrative. Chris Carter from Destructoid praised the jokes featured in the game. However, he disliked the story, which he thought failed to offer motivation for players to complete the game.|$|E

The film, directed and produced by his father, centers on his character Rohit Mehra, a developmentally disabled young man, who comes in contact with an extraterrestrial being—a role that required him to lose nearly [...] Roshan recalls the experience of starring in the film fondly: [...] "I could live my childhood [...] I could eat as many chocolates as I wanted. I became a baby and everybody was so caring towards me." [...] In the book Film Sequels, Carolyn Jess-Cooke drew similarities between the character and Forrest Gump, portrayed by Tom Hanks in the titular film, but this idea was dismissed by Roshan. Film critics were polarised on {{their view of the}} film—some of them negatively compared its storyline to the 1982 Hollywood release E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial—but were unanimous in their praise for Roshan. In a 2010 retrospective of the Top 80 Iconic Performances of Bollywood, Filmfare noted [...] "how flesh and blood Hrithik's act is. Simply because he believes he is the part. Watch <b>him</b> <b>laugh,</b> cry or bond with his remote controlled alien friend and note his nuanced turn." [...] A Rediff.com critic agreed that Roshan was [...] "the turbojet that propels the film to the realm of the extraordinary". Koi... Mil Gaya was the most popular Bollywood film of the year, earning , and Roshan won both Filmfare Awards for Best Actor and Best Actor (Critics).|$|E

Finally, I said,"Alan, I'm he-ere!!"... I think he was very conscious of his looks. Alan would not look beyond {{a certain point in}} the camera because he didn't think he looked good... Jimmy Cagney was not tall but somehow Jimmy was at terms with himself, always. I don't think Alan Ladd ever came to terms with himself.|$|E

2500|$|Morrissey's {{role was}} to create vocal melodies and lyrics. Morrissey's songwriting was {{influenced}} by punk rock and post-punk bands such as the New York Dolls, The Cramps, The Specials and The Cult, along with 1960s girl groups, and singers such as Dusty Springfield, Sandie Shaw, Marianne Faithfull, and Timi Yuro. Morrissey's lyrics, while superficially depressing, were often full of mordant humour; John Peel remarked that the Smiths {{were one of the}} few bands capable of making <b>him</b> <b>laugh</b> out loud. Influenced by his childhood interest in the social realism of 1960s [...] "kitchen sink" [...] television plays, Morrissey wrote about ordinary people and their experiences with despair, rejection and death. While [...] "songs such as 'Still Ill' sealed his role as spokesman for disaffected youth", Morrissey's [...] "manic-depressive rants" [...] and his [...] "'woe-is-me' posture inspired some hostile critics to dismiss the Smiths as 'miserabilists.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|In his villa in Rapallo, Sibelius wrote: [...] "Don Juan. I {{was sitting}} in the dark in my castle when a {{stranger}} entered. I asked who he could be again and again — but there was no answer. I tried to make <b>him</b> <b>laugh</b> but he remained silent. At last the stranger began to sing — then Don Juan knew who it was. It was death." [...] On the same piece of paper, he wrote the bassoon theme for the [...] first part of the second movement, out of which a pizzicatoed string [...] "walking bass" [...] stems. Two months later in Florence, he drafted the second theme, with a note reading [...] "Christus," [...] perhaps symbolizing the death and resurrection of the movement, or even of Finland. Scholars also suggest that Sibelius modeled the second movement after Dante's Divine Comedy. Nonetheless, Robert Kajanus said that the movement [...] "strikes one as the most broken-hearted protest against all the injustice that threatens at the present time to deprive the sun of its light and our flowers of their scent." [...] The movement culminates with a towering, brassy theme, following by an ethereal, mist-like motif in the divided strings.|$|E
2500|$|The Academy of Interactive Arts & Sciences praised Portal for its [...] "hint of comedy", citing GLaDOS' [...] "humorous and homicidal" [...] personality. Writer Lou Kesten, in {{discussing}} humor in video games, cited GLaDOS as possibly {{being the first}} time he discovered that video games could make <b>him</b> <b>laugh</b> out loud. The New York Times editor Charles Herold praised GLaDOS, calling her comments [...] "wildly funny". In an article titled [...] "The GLaDOS Effect - Can Antagonists Rule the World?", Gamasutra publisher Simon Carless describes her as the one true memorable character from Portal. He states that she is the reason he keeps returning to play Portal, describing her as funny, unexpected, and beguiling. The Daily Telegraphs Tom Hoggins wrote that GLaDOS [...] "became one of gaming’s most compelling villains" [...] and that [...] "it managed to get people attached to an inanimate cube. It had the best end credits song of all time. It was funny, smart, fresh and managed to feel like the plucky, accidental hero". GameSpy's Nathan Meunier wrote that [...] "without inhuman antagonist GLaDOS spewing a laugh-inducing tirade of thinly veiled threats in her deadpan robotic drone as you progress deeper into the bowels of Aperture Science, Portal would have been a very different game".|$|E
