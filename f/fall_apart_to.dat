He gave special consideration to the Muslims as to induce them to feel Indian. For the same reason Christians and other minorities could always be sure of Nehru's unflinching protection. The [...] "Secular State", {{that is to say}} a non-Hindu and all-Indian State, was fundamental to this concern.The great bulk of the people of India sensed, and they never lost the sense, that Nehru only wanted to help them and wanted nothing for himself; and that he was a ruler who had pity and kindness....Nehru had conflicts with other Indian leaders, such as Rajagopalachari, Rajendra Prasad and Patel, over Socialism; with Subas Chandra Bose over the Fascist approach; and with Jinnah over the status of the Muslims. Nehru's contests were always over ideas, never over any personal interests of his own, although he waged them without quarter and provoked a good deal of personal enmity. Nehru might have been ignorant or misguided about some matters, and about some persons, but he was always disinterested, always concerned with what he thought would help Indians or mankind. We can be certain {{that there will be no}} revelations to make about him of the kind which are often made about celebrities; not even revelations like those of Churchill's disagreeableness.

40|$|At {{each round}} of infection, viruses <b>fall</b> <b>apart</b> <b>to</b> release their genome for replication, and then {{reassemble}} into stable particles {{within the same}} host cell. For most viruses, the structural details that underlie these disassembly and assembly reactions are poorly understood. Cryo-electron tomography (cryo-ET), a unique method to investigate large and asymmetric structures at the near molecular resolution, was previously used to study the complex structure of vaccinia virus (VV). Here we study the disassembly of VV by cryo-ET on intact, rapidly frozen, mammalian cells, infected for up to 60 minutes. Binding to the cell surface induced distinct structural rearrangements of the core, such as a shape change, the rearrangement of its surface spikes and de-condensation of the viral DNA. We propose that the cell surface induced changes, in particular the decondensation of the viral genome, are a prerequisite for the subsequent release of the vaccinia DNA into the cytoplasm, which is followed by its cytoplasmic replication. Generally, {{this is the first}} study that employs whole cell cryo-ET to address structural details of pathogen-host cell interaction...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: This paper {{looks at}} the {{movement}} of transition in the novels of Chinua Achebe, a literary icon who {{can be regarded as}} Nigeria and Africa’s best- known novelist. By a movement of transition, what is meant is how Achebe has succeeded in giving an artistic interpretation of the history of his people through two kinds of movement – time and place. The movement of time starts from the late 19 th century for Things <b>Fall</b> <b>Apart</b> <b>to</b> around the 1920 ’s for Arrow of God, the 1950 ’s for No Longer at Ease, the mid 60 ’s for A Man of the People and the eighties for Anthills of the Savannah. The movement of place starts gradually from the country – side to the cities. One other feature that can be seen in Achebe’s novels is that in establishing his theme of the transition in the history of his people, Achebe has always relied on the tragic medium in handling this as the tragedy of the major character(s) in each novel become synonymous with the tragedy of a community (either local or national). The paper also explores his contributions to the literary development of Africa, especially with his death on the 22 nd of March, 2013. 1...|$|E
40|$|Chinua Achebe in {{his novel}} Things Fall Apart gives us a unique picture of life in Africa {{before the arrival of}} Christianity and {{colonization}} and the era afterwards. He shows how African people lost their traditional culture and values, replacing them with foreign beliefs. In this article, the way black people lived before the arrival of white people, how they encountered and reacted to white colonizers, in addition to how they converted to Christianity and subsequently to White culture, as portrayed in this novel, will be analyzed. The {{purpose of this study is}} to trace the roots of this rapid pace of colonialism back to when colonial subjects lost their original culture to the new-coming people and to what extent those colonized people were affectively actualizing their inferiority and subordination to the white society. Frantz Fanon’s theories on the relation between language and culture or language and civilization, as well as his discussion of White notion of Blacks and Blacks’ conception of themselves are discussed and analyzed in Achebe’s masterpiece Things <b>Fall</b> <b>Apart</b> <b>to</b> prove that black people attempted to make up for their deep feeling of incompleteness by imitating white people and forming a white personality in a black statue as a result of their own conscious volition...|$|E

40|$|An {{environmental}} {{scanning electron microscope}} (ESEM) {{was used for the}} first time to obtain well-resolved images, in both temporal and spatial dimensions, of lab-prepared frost flowers (FFs) under evaporation within the chamber temperature range from − 5 to − 18  °C and pressures above 500  Pa. Our scanning shows temperature-dependent NaCl speciation: the brine covering the ice was observed at all conditions, whereas the NaCl crystals were formed at temperatures below − 10  °C as the brine oversaturation was achieved. Finger-like ice structures covered by the brine, with a diameter of several micrometres and length of tens to 100  µm, are exposed to the ambient air. The brine-covered fingers are highly flexible and cohesive. The exposure of the liquid brine on the micrometric fingers indicates a significant increase in the brine surface area compared to that of the flat ice surface at high temperatures; the NaCl crystals formed can become sites of heterogeneous reactivity at lower temperatures. There is no evidence that, without external forces, salty FFs could automatically <b>fall</b> <b>apart</b> <b>to</b> create a number of sub-particles at the scale of micrometres as the exposed brine fingers seem cohesive and hard to break in the middle. The fingers tend to combine together to form large spheres and then join back to the mother body, eventually forming a large chunk of salt after complete dehydration. The present microscopic observation rationalizes several previously unexplained observations, namely, that FFs are not a direct source of sea-salt aerosols and that saline ice crystals under evaporation could accelerate the heterogeneous reactions of bromine liberation...|$|E

However, the respirable particles must have a diameter of 1 &ndash; 5 &micro;m in order to deposit in the lungs. Controlled agglomeration of the nanoparticles increases their geometric particle size so they can deposit easily in the lungs. In the lungs, they <b>fall</b> <b>apart</b> <b>to</b> reform nanoparticles, thus enhancing the dissolution rate of the drugs. Theophylline is a bronchodilator with poor solubility in water. Methods: Nanosized theophylline colloids were formed using an amphiphilic surfactant and destabilized using dilute sodium chloride solutions to form the agglomerates. Results: The theophylline nanoparticles thus obtained had an average particle size of 290 nm and a zeta potential of &minus; 39. 5 mV, whereas the agglomerates were 2. 47 &micro;m in size with a zeta potential of &minus; 28. 9 mV. The release profile was found to follow first-order kinetics (r 2 &gt; 0. 96). The aerodynamic characteristics of the agglomerated nanoparticles were determined using a cascade impactor. The behavior of the agglomerate was significantly better than unprocessed raw theophylline powder. In addition, the nanoparticles and agglomerates resulted in a significant improvement in the dissolution of theophylline. Conclusion: The results obtained {{lend support to the}} hypothesis that controlled agglomeration strategies provide an efficient approach for the delivery of poorly water-soluble drugs into the lungs.

40|$|Triazabutadienes are {{nitrogen}} containing compounds with interesting acid-responsive behavior. These compounds {{are relatively}} stable, but once activated by an electrophile, for example through protonation, <b>fall</b> <b>apart</b> <b>to</b> yield diazonium and imine compounds. In general, diazonium compounds are unstable and require harsh methods of synthesis. Therefore, {{the use of}} triazabutadiene compounds as precursors to diazonium compounds, allows for a mild and more controlled access to this reactive moiety. This opens up diazonium chemistry to more complex chemical biology applications, {{as well as in}} the development of applications in organic synthesis. In an effort to design triazabutadiene systems that release diazonium compounds in physiological conditions, water-soluble imidazolium-based triazabutadienes were synthesized by coupling N-heterocycle imidazolium carbenes to aryl azides. These compounds were shown to have pH-dependent reactivity, generating aryl diazonium salts in buffered solutions ranging from pH 4 - 7. This reactivity made these compounds one of the mildest ways of generating aryl diazonium salts in aqueous solutions. Initial stability and reactivity studies were performed by NMR, and by altering the sterics of the imidazolium core and the electronics of the phenyl group. It was determined that the rate and stability were influenced by the sterics and electronics of the scaffold. Electron withdrawing substituents on the phenyl and steric bulk on the imidazole core resulted in stable triazabutadienes, with the opposite being observed for the electron donating substituents on the phenyl and small substituents on the imidazole. Water-soluble triazabutadienes were synthesized to be further utilized as chemical biology probes. In organic solvents, the triazabutadienes reacted with resorcinol, an electron-rich phenyl group to form stable azo compounds. In more physiologically relevant conditions, the triazabutadiene compound was stirred in a pH 6 phosphate/citric buffer solution with a tyrosine analogue and an azo adduct was isolated. This indicated it was possible to target tyrosine residues with a triazabutadiene delivered aryl diazonium through the formation of azo bonds that could be cleaved under mild reducing conditions using sodium dithionite. In addition, the triazabutadiene compounds were found to undergo light-induced isomerism generating the Z isomer in solution upon irradiation. The Z isomer was observed to be more reactive, and would degrade even in basic solutions when irradiated with 350 nm light. This light responsiveness was utilized to enhance the reactivity of triazabutadiene attached onto protein and viral surfaces, allowing the generation and capture of aryl diazonium salts by electron rich aryl-fluorophore conjugates as well as antibody proteins in the case of the virus. Alkyl triazabutadiene compounds were synthesized by coupling N-heterocycle carbenes onto alkyl azides. These compounds were then shown to be capable of delivering alkyl diazonium compounds to carboxylic acids for esterification. This method diversifies esterification from only methyl substituents, as is the case with diazomethane and TMS-diazomethane, to larger more diverse alkyl groups. In conclusion, this work shows that the triazabutadiene compounds have interesting activity that will be vital in the development of novel probes for the study of biological process, as well as the development of reagents for chemical synthesis...|$|E
