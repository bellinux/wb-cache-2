5|$|Even after {{complete}} remission <b>is</b> <b>achieved,</b> leukemic cells likely remain in numbers {{too small to}} be detected with current diagnostic techniques. If no further postremission or consolidation therapy is given, almost all people with AML will eventually relapse. Therefore, more therapy is necessary to eliminate nondetectable disease and prevent relapse— that is, to achieve a cure.|$|E
5|$|For NSCLC, {{the best}} {{prognosis}} <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> with complete surgical resection of stage IA disease, {{with up to}} 70% five-year survival. People with extensive-stage SCLC have an average five-year survival rate of less than 1%. The average survival time for limited-stage disease is 20 months, with a five-year survival rate of 20%.|$|E

5|$|Heart tissue, {{like all}} {{cells in the}} body, needs to be {{supplied}} with oxygen, nutrients {{and a way of}} removing metabolic wastes. This <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by the coronary circulation, which includes arteries, veins, and lymphatic vessels.

25|$|Maximum breaks have {{gradually}} become more commonplace in professional snooker. Only 8 maximums <b>were</b> <b>achieved</b> in the 1980s, but 26 were attained in the 1990s and 35 in the 2000s. Thus {{far in the}} 2010s, over 50 maximums have <b>been</b> <b>achieved.</b> The 100th official maximum break in professional competition <b>was</b> <b>achieved</b> by Mark Selby at the UK Championship on 7 December 2013.|$|R
50|$|The {{specific}} impulse that can <b>be</b> <b>achieved</b> <b>is</b> primarily {{a function of}} the propellant mix (and ultimately would limit the {{specific impulse}}), but practical limits on chamber pressures and the nozzle expansion ratios reduce the performance that can <b>be</b> <b>achieved.</b>|$|R
5|$|The new depot at Temple Mills, to {{the north}} of Stratford, {{replaced}} the North Pole depot in the west of London. In testing, the first Eurostar train ran in St Pancras on 6 March 2007. All CTRL connections are fully grade-separated. This <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> through use of viaducts, bridges, cuttings and in one case, the tunnel portal itself.|$|E
5|$|The {{nitrogen}} cycle in soils {{depends on the}} fixation of atmospheric nitrogen. This <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> {{by a number of}} diazotrophs. One way this can occur is in the nodules in the roots of legumes that contain symbiotic bacteria of the genera Rhizobium, Mesorhizobium, Sinorhizobium, Bradyrhizobium, and Azorhizobium.|$|E
5|$|There {{are three}} main muscle {{groups of the}} forelimb. The triceps muscle {{straightens}} the elbow and foreleg, running from the elbow {{to the bottom of}} the shoulder blade. The muscles which extend the lower leg are called extensor muscles, while the flexion of the lower leg joints <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> through movement of the flexor muscles. There are five main muscles and muscle groups in the hind legs. The vastus muscle flexes the hind leg and runs from stifle to hip, while the gluteal muscles, the large muscles in the hip, extend the femur. Forward motion and flexion of the hind legs <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> through the movement of the quadriceps group of muscles on the front of the femur, while the muscles at the back of the hindquarters, called the hamstring group, provide forward motion of the body and rearward extension of the hind limbs. Extension of the hock <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by the Achilles tendon, located above the hock.|$|E

5|$|These {{characteristics}} are genetically inherited {{and has been}} interpreted as {{the early stages of}} the speciation process. The two ecotypes will eventually become separate species once reproductive isolation <b>is</b> <b>achieved.</b> At the moment, both ecotypes are still capable of interbreeding and producing viable offspring, as such they are still considered a single species.|$|E
5|$|Wet {{deposits}} of ash on high voltage insulators can initiate a leakage current (small amount of current flow across the insulator surface) which, if sufficient current <b>is</b> <b>achieved,</b> can cause ‘flashover’ (the unintended electrical discharge around {{or over the}} surface of an insulating material).|$|E
5|$|Adequate {{potassium}} intake <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> {{by eating}} {{a variety of}} foods. Potassium is present in all fruits, vegetables, meat and fish. Foods with high potassium concentrations include yam, parsley, dried apricots, milk, chocolate, all nuts (especially almonds and pistachios), potatoes, bamboo shoots, bananas, avocados, coconut water, soybeans, and bran. Dried apricots have the highest concentration of potassium by weight of any food. Many processed foods contain no potassium.|$|E

5|$|Battles are turn-based {{and take}} place on grid-based maps. Victory <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> when an enemy base is {{captured}} or all enemies are defeated. Each character holds four weapons and four items, and each has an assigned character class, which affects their movement range, damage and what weapons can be used. Mounted units also {{have the option to}} dismount, which changes their abilities and stats while reducing movement range.|$|E
5|$|Enzymes must bind their {{substrates}} {{before they}} can catalyse any chemical reaction. Enzymes are usually very specific as to what substrates they bind and then the chemical reaction catalysed. Specificity <b>is</b> <b>achieved</b> by binding pockets with complementary shape, charge and hydrophilic/hydrophobic characteristics to the substrates. Enzymes can therefore distinguish between very similar substrate molecules to be chemoselective, regioselective and stereospecific.|$|E
5|$|In {{particle}} physics, {{quantum electrodynamics}} (QED) is the relativistic {{quantum field theory}} of electrodynamics. In essence, it describes how light and matter interact and is the first theory where full agreement between quantum mechanics and special relativity <b>is</b> <b>achieved.</b> QED mathematically describes all phenomena involving electrically charged particles interacting by means of exchange of photons and represents the quantum counterpart of classical electromagnetism giving a complete account of matter and light interaction.|$|E
