500|$|At {{the podium}} interview, {{conducted}} by former {{track and field}} athlete Edwin Moses, race winner Lewis Hamilton acknowledged [...] "a fantastic job by the team" [...] and expressed disappointment over the late safety car, calling it [...] "kind of an anti-climax {{when you have a}} good race like that". During the press conference after the race, Nico Rosberg accused his teammate of deliberately slowing down during the middle stint of the race and compromising his race in the process. Hamilton declared, when asked about the radio message telling him to speed up, that he [...] "wasn't controlling his [...] race, I was controlling my own race". Rosberg reacted to that statement by saying: [...] "It's just now interesting to hear from you, Lewis, that you were just thinking about yourself with the pace in front, and necessarily that was compromising my race." [...] Hamilton was subsequently backed up by Mercedes non-executive chairman Niki Lauda, who said: [...] "Sure, everyone drives selfish. [...] What do you think these guys are here to do? <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> egocentric bastards. That {{is the only way to}} win and the only way to win the Championship, they are all the same." ...|$|E
500|$|Barkley is {{an outspoken}} {{supporter}} of gay rights. In 2006, he told Fox Sports: [...] "I'm a big advocate of gay marriage. If {{they want to}} get married, God bless them." [...] Speaking to Wolf Blitzer on CNN two years later, he said: [...] "Every time I hear the word 'conservative,' it makes me sick to my stomach, because they're really just fake Christians, as <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>them.</b> That's all they are. ... I think they want to be judge and jury. Like, I'm for gay marriage. It's none of my business if gay people want to get married. I'm pro-choice. And I think these Christians, first of all, they're not supposed to judge other people. But they're the most hypocritical judge of people we have in the country. And it bugs the hell out of me. They act like they're Christians. They're not forgiving at all." [...] During a 2011 Martin Luther King, Jr. Day double-header on TNT, Barkley responded to a statement made by Dr. King's daughter Bernice, by saying, [...] "People try to make it about black and white. [...] he talked about equality for every man, every woman. We have a thing going on now, people discriminating against homosexuality in this country. I love the homosexuality people. God bless the gay people. They are great people." ...|$|E

"I {{was delighted}} to find this other way of using video because at last here's video which draws from another source, which is painting... <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> 'video paintings' because if {{you say to people}} 'I make videos', they think of Sting's new rock video or some really boring, grimy 'Video Art'. It's just a way of saying, 'I make videos that don't move very fast." ...|$|E

2500|$|Kant {{also claims}} that an {{external}} environment {{is necessary for}} the establishment of the self. Although Kant would want to argue that there is no empirical way of observing the self, we can see the logical necessity of the self when we observe that we can have different perceptions of the external environment over time. By uniting all of these general representations into one global representation, we can see how a transcendental self emerges. [...] "I am therefore conscious of the identical self in regard to the manifold of the representations that are given to me in an intuition because <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> all together my representations." ...|$|E
2500|$|I will {{be forever}} indebted to Dan [...] for his {{companionship}} and inspiration. Indebted, too, {{because it was}} Dan who insisted on giving my name to the Wulff Series and gave me stature I might never have had otherwise. We were fishing together on the Esopus {{in the spring of}} 1930 when I was trying out some new flies I'd designed in revolt to the then available Catskill patterns. The new flies had bucktail wings and tails for better floatation. I had planned to call one of them the Bucktail Coachman. It was Dan who insisted that <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> Wulffs and he started tying them under that name— Lee Wulff in the tribute in Mist on the River-Remembrances of Dan Bailey.|$|E
2500|$|The band {{prepared}} about 18 {{songs for}} the album and {{teamed up with}} Swedish producers Mikael Nord Andersson an Martin Hansen. All the songs from the album are new written material, except four songs: [...] "Slave Me", [...] "No Limit", [...] "Turn You On" [...] and [...] "The Best Is Yet to Come" [...] which were written during the recording sessions for Unbreakable. During those sessions [...] "Turn You On" [...] had a different title; [...] "The Best Is Yet to Come" [...] was planned to be recorded for the album following Unbreakable, but when the band received an offer from Desmond Child to record [...] they kept the song and recorded it for this album. James Kottak in the interview for Sleaze Roxx explained: [...] "The first four songs that we wrote for this record were actually dark. <b>I</b> <b>call</b> <b>them</b> dark songs because they were probably too heavy compared to the stuff we've done in the past. They were in the vein of [...] "The Good Die Young", but you can't have too many songs like that. I love [...] "The Good Die Young" [...] but I'm glad the way things evolved took us away from where we were headed initially in the songwriting process. We also co-wrote with our producers, Martin Hansen and Mikael Andersson, who took the whole thing to an entirely different level".|$|E
