The CPC followed his line, and at the 12th National Congress, the party constitution was amended, stating that the private economy was a [...] "needed complement to the socialist economy". This sentiment was echoed by Xue Muqiao; [...] "practice shows that socialism is not necessarily based on a unified public ownership by the whole society".|$|R

6000|$|Now, as I have said, I care {{comparatively}} little what is {{done with}} the mere voting part of the matter, {{so long as it}} is not claimed {{in such a way as}} to allow the plutocrat to escape his responsibility for his crimes, by pretending to be much more progressive, or much more susceptible to popular protest, than he ever has been. And there is this danger in many of those who have answered me. One of them, for instance, says that women have been forced into their present industrial situations by the same iron economic laws that have compelled men. I say that men have not been compelled by iron economic laws, but in the main by the coarse and Christless cynicism of other men. But, of course, this way of talking is exactly in accordance with the fashionable and official version of English history. Thus, you will read that the monasteries, places where men of the poorest origin could be powerful, grew corrupt and gradually decayed. Or you will read that the mediaeval guilds of free workmen yielded at last to an inevitable <b>economic</b> <b>law.</b> You will read this; and you will be reading lies. They might as well say that Julius Caesar gradually decayed at the foot of Pompey's statue. You might as well say that Abraham Lincoln yielded at last to an inevitable <b>economic</b> <b>law.</b> The free mediaeval guilds did not decay; they were murdered. Solid men with solid guns and halberds, armed with lawful warrants from living statesmen broke up their corporations and took away their hard cash from them. In the same way the people in Cradley Heath are no more victims of a necessary <b>economic</b> <b>law</b> than the people in Putumayo. They are victims of a very terrible creature, of whose sins much has been said since the beginning of the world; and of whom it was said of old, [...] "Let us fall into the hands of God, for His mercies are great; but let us not fall into the hands of Man." ...|$|E

60|$|But here, as in {{the case}} of the monasteries, we confront the strange problem of submission. If they stole the common from the goose, one can only say that he was a great goose to stand it. The truth is that they {{reasoned}} with the goose; they explained to him that all this was needed to get the Stuart fox over seas. So in the nineteenth century the great nobles who became mine-owners and railway directors earnestly assured everybody that they did not do this from preference, but owing to a newly discovered <b>Economic</b> <b>Law.</b> So the prosperous politicians of our own generation introduce bills to prevent poor mothers from going about with their own babies; or they calmly forbid their tenants to drink beer in public inns. But this insolence is not (as you would suppose) howled at by everybody as outrageous feudalism. It is gently rebuked as Socialism.

It is magnificently the new-fashioned, scientific, efficient business institution.... Except, perhaps, in one tiny detail. King Pemberton and his princely sons {{do not believe in}} all this nonsense about profit-sharing, or a minimum wage, or an eight-hour day, or pensions, {{or any of the other}} fads by which dangerous persons like Mr. Ford, the motor manufacturer, encourage the lazier workmen to think that they have just as much right to rise to the top as the men who have had nerve and foresight. And indeed Mr. Pemberton may be sound. He says that he bases wages on the <b>economic</b> <b>law</b> of supply and demand, instead of on sentiment; and how shrewdly successful are he and his sons is indicated by the fact that Pemberton's is one of the largest sources of drugs and proprietary medicines in the world; the second largest manufactory of soda-fountain syrups; of rubber, celluloid, and leather goods of the kind seen in corner drug-stores; and the third largest manufactory of soaps and toilet articles. It has been calculated that ninety-three million women in all parts of the world have ruined their complexions, and, therefore, their souls, by Pemberton's creams and lotions for saving the same; and that nearly three-tenths of the alcohol consumed in prohibition counties is obtained in Pemberton's tonics and blood-builders and women's specifics, the last being regarded by large farmers with beards as especially tasty and stimulating. Mr. Pemberton is the Napoleon of patent medicine, and also the Napoleon of drugs used by physicians to cure the effects of patent medicine. He is the Shakespeare of ice-cream sodas, and the Edison of hot-water bags. He rules more than five thousand employees, and his name is glorious on cartons in drug-stores, from Sandy Hook to San Diego, and chemists' shops from Hong-Kong to the Scilly Isles. He is a modern Allah, and Mr. S. Herbert Ross is his prophet.|$|E
6000|$|One {{other name}} of great {{importance}} should appear here, because it cannot appear very appropriately anywhere else: the man hardly belonged to the same school as Ruskin and Carlyle, but fought many of their battles, and was even more concentrated on their main task--the task of convicting liberal bourgeois England of priggishness and provinciality. I mean, of course, Matthew Arnold. Against Mill's [...] "liberty" [...] and Carlyle's [...] "strength" [...] and Ruskin's [...] "nature," [...] {{he set up a}} new presence and entity which he called [...] "culture," [...] the disinterested play of the mind through the sifting of the best books and authorities. Though a little dandified in phrase, he was undoubtedly serious and public-spirited in intention. He sometimes talked of culture almost {{as if it were a}} man, or at least a church (for a church has a sort of personality): some may suspect that culture was a man, whose name was Matthew Arnold. But Arnold was not only right but highly valuable. If we have said that Carlyle was a man that saw things, we may add that Arnold was chiefly valuable as a man who knew things. Well as he was endowed intellectually, his power came more from information than intellect. He simply happened to know certain things, that Carlyle didn't know, that Kingsley didn't know, that Huxley and Herbert Spencer didn't know: that England didn't know. He knew that England was a part of Europe: and not so important a part as it had been the morning after Waterloo. He knew that England was then (as it is now) an oligarchical State, and that many great nations are not. He knew that a real democracy need not live and does not live in that perpetual panic about using the powers of the State, which possessed men like Spencer and Cobden. He knew a rational minimum of culture and common courtesy could exist and did exist throughout large democracies. He knew the Catholic Church had been in history [...] "the Church of the multitude": he knew it was not a sect. He knew that great landlords are no more a part of the <b>economic</b> <b>law</b> than nigger-drivers: he knew that small owners could and did prosper. He was not so much the philosopher as the man of the world: he reminded us that Europe was a society while Ruskin was treating it as a picture gallery. He was a sort of Heaven-sent courier. His frontal attack on the vulgar and sullen optimism of Victorian utility may be summoned up in the admirable sentence, in which he asked the English what was the use of a train taking them quickly from Islington to Camberwell, if it only took them [...] "from a dismal and illiberal life in Islington to a dismal and illiberal life in Camberwell?" ...|$|E
6000|$|This is {{the simple}} {{statement}} of the well-known Wages-Fund Theory, [...] which {{has given rise to}} no little animated discussion. Few [...] economists now assent to this doctrine when stated as above, and [...] without changes. The first attack on this explanation of the rate [...] of wages came from what is now a very scarce pamphlet, written by [...] F. D. Longe, entitled “A Refutation of the Wage-Fund Theory of [...] Modern Political Economy” (1866). Because laborers do not really [...] compete with each other, he regarded the idea of average wages as [...] absurd as the idea of an average price of ships and cloth; he [...] declared that there was no predetermined wages-fund necessarily [...] expended on labor; and that “demand for commodities” determined [...] the amount of wealth devoted to paying wages (p. 46). While the [...] so-called wages-fund limits the total amount which the laborers [...] can receive, the employer would try to get his workmen at as [...] much less than that amount as possible, so that the aggregate fund [...] would have no bearing on the actual amount paid in wages. The [...] quantity of work to be done, he asserts, determines the quantity [...] of labor to be employed. About the same time (but unknown to Mr. [...] Longe), W. T. Thornton was studying the same subject, and [...] attracted considerable attention by his publication, “On Labor” [...] (1868), which in Book II, Chap. I, contained an extended argument [...] to show that demand and supply (i.e., the proportion between [...] wages-fund and laborers) did not regulate wages, and denied the [...] existence of a predetermined wages-fund fixed in amount. His [...] attack, however, assumes a very different conception of an [...] <b>economic</b> <b>law</b> from that which we think right to insist upon. The [...] character of mankind being what it is, it will be for their [...] interest to invest so much and no more in labor, and we must [...] believe that in this sense there is a predetermination of wealth [...] to be paid in wages. In order to make good investments, a certain [...] amount must, if capitalists follow their best interests, go to the [...] payment of labor.(162) Mr. Thornton’s argument attracted the more [...] attention because Mr. Mill(163) admitted that Mr. Thornton had [...] induced him to abandon his Wages-Fund Theory. The subject was, [...] however, taken up, re-examined by Mr. Cairnes,(164) and stated in [...] a truer form. (1.) The total wealth of a country (circle A in the [...] diagram) is the outside limit of its capital. How much capital [...] will be saved out of this depends upon the effective desire of [...] accumulation in the community (as set forth in Book I, Chap. [...] VIII). The size of circle B within circle A, therefore, depends on [...] the character of the people. The wages-fund, then, depends [...] ultimately on the extent of A, and proximately on the extent of B. [...] It can never be larger than B. So far, at least, its amount is [...] “predetermined” in the economic sense by general laws regarding [...] the accumulation of capital and the expectation of profit. Circle [...] B contracts and expands under influences which have nothing to do [...] with the immediate bargains between capitalists and laborers. (2.) [...] Another influence now comes in to affect the amount of capital [...] actually paid as wages, one also governed by general causes [...] outside the reach of laborer or capitalist, that is, the state of [...] the arts of production. In production, the particular conditions [...] of each industry will determine how much capital is to be set [...] apart for raw material, how much for machinery, buildings, and all [...] forms of fixed capital, and how many laborers will be assigned to [...] a given machine for a given amount of material. With some kinds of [...] hand-made goods the largest share of capital goes to wages, a less [...] amount for materials, and a very small proportion for machinery [...] and tools. In many branches of agriculture and small farming this [...] holds true. The converse, however, is true in many manufactures, [...] where machinery is largely used. No two industries will maintain [...] the same proportion between the three elements. The nature of the [...] industry, therefore, will determine whether a greater or a less [...] share of capital will be spent in wages. It is needless to say [...] that this condition of things is not one to be changed at the [...] demand of either of the two parties to production, Labor and [...] Capital; it responds only to the advance of mechanical science or [...] general intelligence. It is impossible, then, to escape the [...] conclusion that general causes restrict the amount which will, [...] under any normal investment, go to the payment of wages. Only [...] within the limits set by these forces can any further expansion or [...] contraction take place. (3.) Within these limits, of course, minor [...] changes may take place, so that the fund can not be said to be [...] “fixed” or “absolutely predetermined”; but these changes must take [...] place within such narrow limits that they do not much affect the [...] practical side of the question. How these changes act, may be seen [...] {{in a part of the}} following illustration of the above principles: ...|$|E
