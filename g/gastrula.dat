Experimentally modified embryos that do not express this protein will fail to develop mesoderm and initiate gastrulation. During the blastula and <b>gastrula</b> stages, Wnt as well as BMP and FGF pathways will induce the antero-posterior axis formation, regulate the precise placement of the primitive streak (gastrulation and mesoderm formation) {{as well as the}} process of neurulation (central nervous system development).|$|E
25|$|A zygote {{initially}} develops into {{a hollow}} sphere, called a blastula, which undergoes rearrangement and differentiation. In sponges, blastula larvae swim to a new location and develop into a new sponge. In most other groups, the blastula undergoes more complicated rearrangement. It first invaginates to form a <b>gastrula</b> with a digestive chamber, and two separate germ layers—an external ectoderm and an internal endoderm. In most cases, a mesoderm also develops between them. These germ layers then differentiate to form tissues and organs.|$|E
25|$|Another common {{argument}} against dualism consists {{in the idea}} that since human beings (both phylogenetically and ontogenetically) begin their existence as entirely physical or material entities and since nothing outside of {{the domain of the}} physical is added later on in the course of development, then we must necessarily end up being fully developed material beings. There is nothing non-material or mentalistic involved in conception, the formation of the blastula, the <b>gastrula,</b> and so on. The postulation of a non-physical mind would seem superfluous.|$|E
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown the {{presence}} of a network of extracellular fibrils on the inner surface of the ectodermal layer of the Ambysloma maculatum <b>gastrulae.</b> The alignment of the network along the blastopore-animal pole axis has suggested that the network of fibrils guides the migrating mesodermal cells in <b>gastrulae</b> by contact guidance. We have also shown that these fibrils can be deposited on substrata by explanted embryonic fragments and that substrata conditioned in this manner support directed cell migration. In this study, we found that the appearance of the fibrils in the embryos coincides with the start of cell migration towards the animal pole. <b>Gastrulae</b> of three urodele species examined (A. maculatum, A. mexicanum and Cynops pyrrhogaster) have similar dense networks of fibrils. Xenopus laevis <b>gastrulae</b> also have similar fibrils but fewer fibrils com-pared to urodele embryos. Rana pipiens <b>gastrulae</b> have very few extracellular fibrils.

There {{was no significant difference}} between <b>gastrulae</b> and 4 -arm plutei mortality from all sites examined. Furthermore, there was little variability in temperature tolerance across the biogeographic range as southern <b>gastrulae</b> and 4 -arm plutei exhibited similar tolerances to northern individuals. Relative levels of hsp 70 mRNA expression did not differ overall between the two developmental stages at each site. Across sites, all <b>gastrulae</b> and 4 -arm plutei exhibited maximum hsp 70 expression at approximately 25 °C; however, the range of hsp 70 expression was narrower in southern individuals, suggesting they are living closer to their upper thermal limit than northern individuals...|$|R

25|$|Deuterostomes {{differ from}} protostomes in several ways. Animals from both groups possess a {{complete}} digestive tract. However, in protostomes, the first {{opening of the}} gut to appear in embryological development (the archenteron) develops into the mouth, with the anus forming secondarily. In deuterostomes the anus forms first, with the mouth developing secondarily. In most protostomes, cells simply fill {{in the interior of}} the <b>gastrula</b> to form the mesoderm, called schizocoelous development, but in deuterostomes, it forms through invagination of the endoderm, called enterocoelic pouching. Deuterostome embryos undergo radial cleavage during cell division, while protostomes undergo spiral cleavage.|$|E
25|$|Dissection of Tarebia granifera showed blastula stage embryos in the brood pouches of snails {{as small}} as 8mm shell height. Small numbers of shelled embryos, {{including}} veligers, were found in snails of 10–14mm but became more plentiful in snails >14mm and especially those >20mm. Importantly, unshelled embryos (blastula, <b>gastrula</b> and trochophore stages) were not found in snails >16mm and the numbers of shelled embryos themselves decreased in the largest snails, >24mm. This suggests that differentiation of germinal cells in the ovary and their subsequent arrival in the brood pouch as blastulae is not a continuous process over a breeding season but occurs as one or more ‘cohorts’ or ‘pulses’ which stop before the birth rate of young snails reaches its maximum. So it seems that while the first birth may occur in snails {{as small as}} 8mm, these are few and most juveniles are born to snails >14mm.

40|$|SummaryThe {{vertebrate}} heart arises during gastrulation as cardiac precursors converge {{from the}} lateral plate mesoderm territories toward the embryonic midline and extend rostrally to form bilateral heart fields. G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) mediate {{functions of the}} nervous and immune systems; however, their roles in gastrulation remain largely unexplored. Here, we show that the zebrafish homologs of the Agtrl 1 b receptor and its ligand, Apelin, implicated in physiology and angiogenesis, control heart field formation. Zebrafish <b>gastrulae</b> express agtrl 1 b in the lateral plate mesoderm, while apelin expression is confined to the midline. Reduced or excess Agtrl 1 b or Apelin function caused deficiency of cardiac precursors and, subsequently, the heart. In Apelin-deficient <b>gastrulae,</b> the cardiac precursors converged inefficiently to the heart fields and showed ectopic distribution, whereas cardiac precursors overexpressing Apelin exhibited abnormal morphology and rostral migration. Our results implicate GPCR signaling in movements of discrete cell populations that establish organ rudiments during vertebrate gastrulation...|$|R

Embryos fixed with LN were embedded and sectioned at 70 - 80 nm and examined in the electron microscope. Both techniques show {{a dramatic increase in}} the amount of stainable material in the extracellular matrix during development. Blastula stage embryos have a small amount of material in the extracellular matrix. Early <b>gastrulae</b> have more stainable material than blastulae and this increased amount appears to be due to an accumulation of material in the marginal zone of the embryo, especially near the dorsal lip of the blastopore.

Interspecific arrested hybrid embryos do not show the same dramatic accumulation of stainable material in their extracellular matrices...|$|R
60|$|Section 8. The {{next phase}} of {{development}} has an equally curious resemblance to and difference from what occurs {{in the case of}} the ova of animals which do not contain yolk. In such types (e.g., amphioxus) a part of the blastosphere wall is tucked into the rest, and a <b>gastrula</b> formed by this process of invagination. In the frog (Figure 5) there is a tucking-in, but the part that should lie within the <b>gastrula,</b> the yolk-containing cells, are far larger than the epiblast (ep.) which should, form the outer layer of cells. Hence the epiblast can only by continual growth accommodate what it must embrace, and the process of tucking-in is accompanied by one of growth of the epiblast, as shown by the unbarbed arrow, over the yolk. This stage is called the <b>gastrula</b> stage; ar. is the cavity of the <b>gastrula,</b> the archenteron; b.p. is its opening or blastopore. Such a <b>gastrula,</b> formed mainly by overgrowth of the epiblast, is called an epibolic <b>gastrula,</b> as distinguished from the invaginate <b>gastrula</b> of amphioxus. The difference is evidently entirely due to the presence of yolk, and the consequent modification of invagination in the former case.|$|E

40|$|We {{have found}} that {{ectodermal}} fragments of Ambystoma maculatum <b>gastrulae</b> deposit immense numbers of 0 - 1 /im diameter extracellular fibrils on plastic coverslips. When migrating mesodermal cells from A. maculatum <b>gastrulae</b> are seeded on such conditioned plastic substrata, they attach and begin migrating after 15 — 30 min in vitro. We did {{a detailed analysis of}} the relationship between fibril orientation and cell migration using time-lapse cinemicrography, scanning electron microscopy, and a microcomputer with a graphics tablet and morphometric program. We found that cells move in directions closely related to the orientation of fibrils. Usually fibrils are oriented in dense arrays with a predominance of fibrils running parallel to the blastopore-animal pole axis of the explant, and cells move preferentially along lines parallel to the blastopore-animal pole axis. When fibrils are unalig-ned, cells move at random. We have also shown that cells move with a slightly stronger tendency towards the animal pole direction. These results are discussed concerning the mechanism of specific cell migration during amphibian gastrulation...|$|R
40|$|During early {{vertebrate}} embryogenesis, cell fate specification {{is often}} coupled with cell acquisition of specific adhesive, polar and/or motile behaviors. In Xenopus <b>gastrulae,</b> tissues fated to form different axial structures display distinct motility. The {{cells in the}} early organizer move collectively and directionally toward the animal pole and contribute to anterior mesendoderm, whereas the dorsal and the ventral-posterior trunk tissues surrounding the blastopore of mid-gastrula embryos undergo convergent extension and convergent thickening movements, respectively. While factors regulating cell lineage specification have been described in some detail, the molecular machinery that controls cell motility is not understood in depth. To gain insight into the gene battery that regulates both cell fates and motility in particular embryonic tissues, we performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) to investigate differentially expressed genes in the early organizer, the dorsal and the ventral marginal zone of Xenopus <b>gastrulae.</b> We uncovered many known signaling and transcription factors that {{have been reported to}} play roles in embryonic patterning during gastrulation. We also identified many uncharacterized genes as well as genes that encoded extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins or potential regulators of actin cytoskeleton. Co-expression of a selected subset of the differentially expressed genes with activin in animal caps revealed that they had distinct ability to block activin-induced animal cap elongation. Most of these factors did not interfere with mesodermal induction by activin, but an ECM protein, EFEMP 2, inhibited activin signaling and acted downstream of the activated type I receptor. By focusing on a secreted protein kinase PKDCC 1, we showed with overexpression and knockdown experiments that PKDCC 1 regulated gastrulation movements as well as anterior neural patterning during early Xenopus development. Overall, our studies identify many differentially expressed signaling and cytoskeleton regulators in different embryonic regions of Xenopus <b>gastrulae</b> and imply their functions in regulating cell fates and/or behaviors during gastrulation. clos...|$|R

60|$|Section 16. Invagination follows (Figure 6). In {{this process}} {{a portion of}} the blastosphere wall is the tucked into the rest, as {{indicated}} by the arrow, so that a two-layered sack is formed. The space ar. is the archenteron, the primordial intestine, and its mouth is called, the blastopore (bp.). The outer layer of this double-walled sac is called the epiblast. For the present we will give the inner lining no special term. The young amphioxus has, at this stage, which is called the <b>gastrula</b> stage, a curious parallelism with such a lowly form as the Hydra of our ditches. This latter creature, like the <b>gastrula,</b> consists essentially of two layers of cells, an outer protective and sensory layer, and an inner digestive one; it has a primordial intestine, or archenteron, and its mouth is sometimes regarded as being a blastopore. All animals that have little yolk, and start early in life for themselves, pass through a <b>gastrula</b> stage, substantially the same as this of amphioxus.|$|E

60|$|Section 25. There is no open {{invagination}} of an archenteron in the fowl, {{as in the}} frog--, the <b>gastrula,</b> {{like the}} blastosphere, stage is also masked. But, in the hinder region of the germinal area, a thick mass of cells, grows inward and forward, and, appearing in the dorsal view of the egg as a white streak, is called the primitive streak (p.s.). By {{a comparison of the}} figures of frog and fowl the student will easily perceive the complete correspondence of the position of this with the blastopore of the frog. The relation of the two will be easily understood if we compare the fowl's archenteron to a glove-finger under pressure-- its cavity is obliterated-- and the frog's to the glove-finger blown out. The tension of the protoplasm, straining over the enormous yolk, answers to the pressure. The <b>gastrula</b> in the fowl is solid. The primitive streak is, in fact, the scar of a closed blastopore. As we should expect from this view of its homology, at the primitive streak, the three embryonic layers are continuous and indistinguishable (Figure 2). Elsewhere in the blastoderm they are distinctly separate. Just as the yolk cells of the frog form the ventral wall of the intestine, so nuclei appear along the upper side of the yolk of the fowl, where some protoplasm still exists, and give rise to the ventral hypoblastic cells. By conceiving a gradually increasing amount of yolk in the hypoblastic cells in the ventral side of the archenteron, the substantial identity of the <b>gastrula</b> stage in the three types, which at first appear so strikingly different, will be perceived. Carry Figures 4 and 5 of the frog one step further by increasing the size of the shaded yolk and leaving it unsegmented, and instead of ar. in 5 show a solid mass of cells, and the condition of things in the fowl would at once be rendered.|$|E
60|$|Section 35. The early {{development}} of the rabbit is apt to puzzle students a little at first. We have an ovum practically free from yolk (alecithal), and, therefore, we find it dividing completely and almost equally. We naturally assume, from what we have learnt, that the next stages will be {{the formation of a}} hollow blastosphere, invagination, a <b>gastrula</b> forming mesoblast by hollow outgrowths from the archenteron, and so on. There is no yolk here to substitute epiboly (Section 9) for invagination, nor to obliterate the archenteron and the blastopore through its pressure.|$|E

40|$|Nodal and Smad 2 / 3 signals play pivotal {{roles in}} mesendoderm {{induction}} and axis determination during late blastulation and early gastrulation in vertebrate embryos. However, Smad 2 / 3 direct target genes during those critical developmental stages {{have not been}} systematically identified. Here, through ChIP-chip assay, we show that the promoter/enhancer regions of 679 genes are bound by Smad 2 in the zebrafish early <b>gastrulas.</b> Expression analyses confirm that {{a significant proportion of}} Smad 2 targets are indeed subjected to Nodal/Smad 2 regulation at the onset of gastrulation. The co-existence of DNA-binding sites of other transcription factors in the Smad 2 -bound regions allows the identification of well known Smad 2 -binding partners, such as FoxH 1 and Lef 1 /β-catenin, as well as many previously unknown Smad 2 partners, including Oct 1 and Gata 6, during embryogenesis. We demonstrate that Oct 1 physically associates with and enhances the transcription and mesendodermal induction activity of Smad 2, whereas Gata 6 exerts an inhibitory role in Smad 2 signaling and mesendodermal induction. Thus, our study systemically uncovers a large number of Smad 2 targets in early <b>gastrulas</b> and suggests cooperative roles of Smad 2 and other transcription factors in controlling target gene transcription, which will be valuable for studying regulatory cascades during germ layer formation and patterning of vertebrate embryos...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA new fate map for mesodermal tissues in Xenopus laevis {{predicted}} that the prime meridian, which runs from the animal pole to the vegetal pole {{through the center of}} Spemann's organizer, is the embryo's anterior midline, not its dorsal midline (M.

In this report, we demonstrate by lineage labeling that the column 1 blastomeres at st. 6, which populate the prime meridian, give rise to the anterior end of the embryo. In addition, we surgically isolate and culture tissue centered on this meridian from early <b>gastrulae.</b> This tissue forms a patterned head with morphologically distinct ventral and dorsal structures. In situ hybridization and immunostaining reveal that the cultured heads contain the anterior tissues of all three germ layers, correctly patterned. Regardless of how we dissect early <b>gastrulae</b> along meridians running from the animal to the vegetal pole, both the formation of head structures and the expression of anterior marker genes always segregate with the prime meridian passing through Spemann's organizer. The prime meridian also gives rise to dorsal, axial mesoderm, but not uniquely, as specification tests show that dorsal mesoderm arises in fragments of the embryo which exclude the prime meridian. These results support the hypothesis that the midline that bisects Spemann's organizer is the embryo's anterior midline...|$|R

Each, starting from the condition of a simple nucleated cell, becomes a cell-aggregate; and this passes through a condition which represents the <b>gastrula</b> stage, before taking on the features distinctive of the group to which it belongs. Stated in this form, the [...] "gastræa theory" [...] of Haeckel appears to the present writer to be one of most important and best founded of recent generalisations.

60|$|In certain animals {{belonging}} to {{every one of}} the chief groups into which the Metazoa are divisible, the cells of the cell-aggregate which results from the process of yelk-division, and which is termed a morula, diverge from one another in such a manner as to give rise to a central space, around which they dispose themselves as a coat or envelope; and thus the morula becomes a vesicle filled with fluid, the planula. The wall of the planula is next pushed in on one side, or invaginated, whereby it is converted into a double-walled sac with an opening, the blastopore, which leads into the cavity lined by the inner wall. This cavity is the primitive alimentary cavity or archenteron; the inner or invaginated layer is the hypoblast; the outer the epiblast; and the embryo, in this stage, is termed a <b>gastrula.</b> In all the higher animals a layer of cells makes its appearance between the hypoblast and the epiblast, and is termed the mesoblast. In the further course of development the epiblast becomes the ectoderm or epidermic layer of the body; the hypoblast becomes the epithelium of the middle portion of the alimentary canal; and the mesoblast gives rise to all the other tissues, except the central nervous system, which originates from an ingrowth of the epiblast.|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{classical}} three-signal {{model of}} amphibian mesoderm induction and more recent modifications together propose that an activin-like signaling activity is uniformly distributed across the vegetal {{half of the}} Xenopus blastula and that this activity contributes to mesoderm induction. In support of this, we have previously shown that the activin-response element (DE) of the goosecoid promoter is uniformly activated across the vegetal half of midgastrula-stage embryos. Here, we further examine {{the nature of this}} activity by measuring DE activation by endogenous signals over time. We find that the spatiotemporal pattern of DE activation is much more dynamic than was previously appreciated and also conclude that DE(6 X) Luc activity reflects endogenous nodal signaling in the embryo. Using both the DE(6 X) Luc construct and endogenous Xbra and Xgsc expression as read-outs for nodal activity, and the cleavage-mutant version of Xnr 2 (CmXnr 2) to regionally suppress endogenous nodal activity, we demonstrate that nodal signals act cell-autonomously in Xenopus <b>gastrulae.</b> Nodal-expressing cells are unable to rescue either reporter gene activation or target gene expression in distant nodal-deficient cells, suggesting that nodals function at short range in this context. Finally, we show that DE activation by endogenous signals occurs in the absence of dorsal β-catenin-mediated signaling, but that the timing of dorsal initiation is altered. We conclude that nodal signals in Xenopus <b>gastrulae</b> function cell autonomously at short ranges and that the spatiotemporal pattern of this signaling along the dorsoventral axis is regulated by maternal Wnt-like signaling...|$|R

We have identified a zebrafish ortholog of human FGF 17, named fgf 17 b. The first phase of fgf 17 b expression occurs in the blastodermal margin of late blastulae and in the embryonic shield of early <b>gastrulae.</b> The second phase starts after the onset of segmentation, mainly in the presomitic mesoderm and newly formed somites. Injection of fgf 17 b mRNA into one-cell embryos induces expression of the mesodermal marker no tail (ntl) and rescues ntl expression suppressed by overexpression of lefty 1 (lft 1). Overexpression of fgf 17 b dorsalizes zebrafish <b>gastrulae</b> by enhancing expression of chordin (chd), which is an antagonist of the ventralizing signals BMPs. In addition, overexpression of fgf 17 b posteriorizes the neuroectoderm. Simultaneous knockdown of fgf 17 b and fgf 8 with antisense morpholinos results in reduction of chd and ntl. Knockdown of fgf 17 b can alleviate inhibitory effect of ectopic expression of fgf 3 on otx 1. These data together suggest that Fgf 17 b {{plays a role in}} early embryonic patterning. We also demonstrate that fgf 17 b and fgf 8 have stronger mesoderm inducting activity than fgf 3, whereas fgf 17 b and fgf 3 have stronger activity in posteriorizing the neuroectoderm than fgf 8.
