From this period the fort is known as Castellum Beroart.|$|E

5|$|Camuston {{no longer}} exists as a village, but for {{location}} see for example the 1794 map by Ainslie. The Camuston Cross, once thought to mark the place of Camus' death, is now {{thought to be a}} late Pictish era monument, dating from the 10th Century. It should be noted that 'Camus' is not recognisable as a Scandinavian name, and that there are earlier variants of the place name, e.g. 'Cambistown' as it is called in <b>documents</b> <b>from</b> 1425–6, which has a Celtic etymology.|$|E
5|$|Described as the {{definitive}} deathblow to democracy in Guatemala, the coup was widely criticized internationally, {{and contributed to}} long-lasting anti-U.S. sentiment in Latin America. Attempting to justify the coup, the CIA launched Operation PBHISTORY, which sought evidence of Soviet influence in Guatemala among <b>documents</b> <b>from</b> the Árbenz era: the effort was a failure. Castillo Armas quickly assumed dictatorial powers, banning opposition parties, imprisoning and torturing political opponents, and reversing the social reforms of the revolution. Nearly four decades of civil war followed, as leftist guerrillas fought a series of U.S.-backed authoritarian regimes whose brutalities included a genocide of the Maya peoples.|$|E

5|$|Fripp's diaries were internationally {{discussed}} {{following his}} publication of <b>documents</b> <b>from</b> {{a dispute with}} Grooveshark, an on-line distributor of music. Fripp and Singleton complained that Grooveshark had been continuing to distribute his music, even after repeated takedown notices and other complaints.

Fripp's exchange with Grooveshark was included in a suit against Grooveshark by Universal Music Group, which was filed in November 2011.|$|E
5|$|From its {{founding}} in the 9th century until the Industrial Revolution, Oldham {{is believed to have}} been little more than a scattering of small and insignificant settlements spread across the moorland and dirt tracks that linked Manchester to York. Although not mentioned in the Domesday Book, Oldham does appear in legal <b>documents</b> <b>from</b> the Middle Ages, invariably recorded as territory under the control of minor ruling families and barons. In the 13th century, Oldham was documented as a manor held from the Crown by a family surnamed Oldham, whose seat was at Werneth Hall.|$|E
5|$|Fuad Shubaki, former {{financial}} aide to Arafat, {{told the}} Israeli security service Shin Bet that Arafat used {{several million dollars}} of aid money to buy weapons and support militant groups. During Israel's Operation Defensive Shield, the Israel army recovered counterfeit money and <b>documents</b> <b>from</b> Arafat's Ramallah headquarters. The documents showed that, in 2001, Arafat personally approved payments to Tanzim militants. The Palestinians claimed that the counterfeit money was confiscated from criminal elements.|$|E

5|$|George was {{ridiculed}} by his British subjects; {{some of his}} contemporaries, such as Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, {{thought him}} unintelligent {{on the grounds that}} he was wooden in public. Though he was unpopular in Great Britain due to his supposed inability to speak English, such an inability may not have existed later in his reign as <b>documents</b> <b>from</b> that time show that he understood, spoke and wrote English. He certainly spoke fluent German and French, good Latin, and some Italian and Dutch. His treatment of his wife, Sophia Dorothea, became something of a scandal.|$|E
5|$|Gossip soon {{spread of}} the {{existence}} of an illegitimate child. Some historians contend that, sometime before August 1800 in Weymouth, Sophia gave birth to a child fathered by Garth. Flora Fraser believes the rumours that Sophia had a child, but has questioned whether the child was fathered by Garth, or Sophia's brother the Duke of Cumberland. Historians further write that the child, baptised Thomas Garth like his father, was raised by his father in Weymouth, where his mother would visit him occasionally. In 1828 he apparently tried to blackmail the royal family with certain incriminating <b>documents</b> <b>from</b> his father about his supposed parents' relationship, though this ended in failure.|$|E
5|$|Handscroll: The handscroll {{originated}} from ancient Chinese text <b>documents.</b> <b>From</b> the Spring and Autumn period (770-481 BCE) through the Han dynasty (206 BCE - 220 CE), bamboo or wooden slips were bound {{and used to}} write texts on. During the Eastern Han period (25-220), the use of paper and silk as handscrolls became more common. The handscroll was {{the one of the}} main formats for texts up until the Tang dynasty (618-907). Since the Three Kingdoms (220–280), the handscroll became a standard form for mounting artwork. New styles were developed over time.|$|E
