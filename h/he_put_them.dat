25|$|Bloxam {{also noticed}} that the Hawaiian nectar-feeding birds were {{different}} from both humming birds and the genus {{with which they were}} then associated, Certhia (creepers). <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> into a new genus Nectarina and wrote that in their flight they resembled finches. It was some 150 years later that it was accepted that the Hawaiian honeycreepers (now in several different genera) had evolved from cardueline finches.|$|E

During the day of Yom Kippur, the High Priest would immerse himself five times and wash his hands and feet ten times. Except for this first immersion, he would do each on holy ground in the Parwah cell. They spread a linen sheet between him and the people. If the High Priest was either old or delicate, they warmed the water for him. He undressed, immersed himself, came up, and dried off. They brought him the golden garments; <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> on and washed his hands and feet.|$|E

25|$|Harrison {{intended}} to use the company as scouts and foragers. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in a wide formation around {{the main body of}} the army where they kept watch for enemies and gathered wild game to bring back to the main army. The company was successful and was even able to find beehives and bring back ten gallons of honey. On October 3 the army reached the site of modern Terre Haute, a strategic location on the Wabash River. The company continued to scout the countryside and forage while the rest of the army constructed Fort Harrison. A small detachment of mounted men under the command of Lieutenant Thomas Berry was added the Yellow Jackets.|$|E
25|$|All guests retire for bed except Lord Charles and Sir George. Mr. Carlile {{is sent to}} get {{the plans}} for the fighter from the safe, so he set off for the study, colliding with Mrs. Vanderlyn who wants to {{retrieve}} her handbag. The two men walk along the terrace, when Lord Charles is startled by a figure leaving the study by the French window, although Sir George sees nothing. When they enter the study, Mr. Carlile has the papers out but Lord Charles quickly sees that the plans of the fighter itself are gone. Carlile is adamant that they were in the safe and <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> on the table. He was distracted when he heard a woman's scream in the hallway and ran out to find Leonie, Mrs. Vanderlyn's maid, who claimed that she had seen a ghost. Carlile had not otherwise left the study. Sir George suggests calling in Hercule Poirot immediately.|$|E
500|$|That evening, Christian inveigled aboard Bounty a {{party of}} Tahitians, mainly women, for a social gathering. With the festivities under way, he cut the anchor rope and Bounty sailed away with her captive guests. Coleman escaped by diving {{overboard}} and reached land. Among the abducted group were six elderly women, for whom Christian had no use; <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> ashore on the nearby island of Mo'orea. Bountys complement now comprised nine mutineers—Christian, Young, Quintal, Brown, Martin, John Williams, William McCoy, John Mills, and John Adams (known by the crew as [...] "Alexander Smith")—and 20 Polynesians, of whom 14 were women.|$|E

500|$|After {{several days}} in hiding, Scheiman rejoined his wife, and Wiesenthal was taken {{by members of the}} {{underground}} to the nearby village of Kulparkow, where he remained until the end of 1943. Soon afterwards the Janowska camp was liquidated; this made it unsafe to hide in the nearby countryside, so Wiesenthal returned to Lvov, where he spent three days hiding in a closet at the Scheiman's apartment. He next moved to the apartment of Paulina Busch, for whom he had previously forged an identity card. He was arrested there, hiding under the floorboards, on 13 June 1944 and taken back to the remains of the camp at Janowska. Wiesenthal tried but failed to commit suicide to avoid being interrogated about his connections with the underground. In the end {{there was no time for}} interrogations, as Soviet forces were advancing into the area. SS-Hauptsturmfuhrer Friedrich Warzok, the new camp commandant, rounded up the remaining prisoners and transported them to Przemyśl, [...] west of Lvov, where <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> to work building fortifications. By September Warzok and his men were reassigned to the front, and Wiesenthal and the other surviving captives were sent to the Kraków-Płaszów concentration camp.|$|E
2500|$|His fellow umpire Simon Taufel said of him, as {{quoted in}} his Wisden obituary: [...] "What doesn't get {{highlighted}} is man-management skills, creating a happy environment for players to play in. And Shep was magnificent at that. The players had this enormous {{respect for him}} as a person. <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> at their ease and forged relationships that crossed all cultural and political divides." [...] In that obituary, the obituarist himself wrote: [...] "The authorities struggle for a definition of the Spirit of Cricket. Perhaps the best answer is David Shepherd.|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, the Thing was {{featured}} {{as half of}} the Saturday morning cartoon Fred and Barney Meet the Thing. The character of the Thing received a radical make-over for the series.

2500|$|Robert Rainbird, {{proprietor}} of the Greatwood Guest House at Mylor Creek, near Falmouth, [...] was familiar with Darlwyne, having cruised with Bown {{in one of the}} earlier Tall Ships trips. According to his later account, when two of his guests asked him about the possibility of organising a sea excursion, <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in touch with Bown. On the evening of Saturday 30 July, amid celebrations following England's victory in the 1966 FIFA World Cup Final, Bown and his friend Jeffrey Stock, a qualified engineer, visited Greatwood. As a result, enthusiasm for a sea trip spread to all the [...] guests, and an agreement was made to take a large party to Fowey the following day.

2500|$|They {{brought him}} to the Parwah cell, spread a sheet of linen between him and the people, he washed his hands and feet, and undressed.

They brought him white garments (as required by [...] ). <b>He</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> on and washed his hands and feet. Rabbi Meir taught that in the morning, he wore Pelusium linen worth 12 minas, and in the afternoon he wore Indian linen worth 800 zuz. But the sages said that in the morning, he wore garments worth 18 minas, and in the afternoon he wore garments worth 12 minas. The community paid for these sums, and the High Priest could spend more from his own funds if he wanted to.|$|E

2500|$|Geoff Boycott had now {{achieved}} {{his dream}} of becoming England captain, but {{failed to make the}} most of his opportunity in New Zealand. Although Barrington saw that the training facilities and grounds were poor compared to those in England he praised the New Zealanders for their efforts, but Boycott constantly complained and annoyed many locals who had worked hard to prepare for the England team's arrival. He became the first England captain to lose a Test to New Zealand when <b>he</b> <b>put</b> <b>them</b> in to bat in the First Test and saw England collapse to 64 all out in the last innings. Boycott made 1 and the other players resented his comments that they played like schoolboys. In the Second Test Barrington with the backing of the players told Boycott to declare so that England would have a chance of winning and by dismissing New Zealand for 105 they squared the series. The Third Test was drawn, but by arguing with Barrington in public and berating the New Zealand press corps Boycott made certain he would not be made England captain again. On their return to England Brearley soon resumed his role and Willis was made vice-captain; [...] "No manager worked harder on behalf of his players nor was better appreciated. Certainly no player on that tour that I spoke to would dissent from this view".|$|E
