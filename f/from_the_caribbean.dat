5|$|In North American waters, the finetooth shark {{is common}} and found from North Carolina to the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, and very occasionally straying {{as far north as}} New York. In Central and South American waters, it is rare, but may occur more widely than presently known, having been reported off Trinidad and Guyana, infrequently <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> Sea, and off southern Brazil from São Paulo to Santa Catarina. The northwestern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and South America populations are distinct, with little interchange between them. Old records exist of this species in the eastern Atlantic off Senegal and Guinea-Bissau, but these likely represent misidentifications of spinner sharks (C. brevipinna).|$|E
5|$|In the 1880s Ezra Asher Osborn and Elnathan T. Field of New Jersey {{started an}} {{enterprise}} {{to develop the}} Florida coast from Key Biscayne to Jupiter by clearing native vegetation, leveling Indian midden mounds and beach dunes, and planting coconuts. Osborn and Field imported 300,000unhusked coconuts <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean,</b> of which 76,000 were planted on Key Biscayne. Most of the shoots from the coconuts on Key Biscayne were eaten by rats and marsh rabbits (Sylvilagus palustris). As {{a result of their}} efforts, in 1885 Osborn and Field were allowed to purchase Key Biscayne and other oceanfront land from the Florida Internal Improvement Trust Fund for 70cents an acre.|$|E

5|$|The California {{spiny lobster}} {{is one of}} 19 species in the genus Panulirus, {{which is one of}} several genera of spiny {{lobsters}} whose names are anagrams of the original spiny lobster genus, Palinurus.

5|$|A {{tropical}} wave {{exited the}} coast of Africa on September 16. It traversed steadily westward, with the southern portion of the wave axis moving across northern South America. On September 26 the wave entered the eastern Pacific Ocean near Panama, and slowly organized. A weak low-level trough extended <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> Sea to south of Mexico, disrupting the normal flow of westward steering currents. On October 3, the tropical wave developed a distinct area of deep convection, and began to drift eastward {{to the south of}} Mexico. Two days later a low-level circulation formed, and midday on October 5 the system developed into Tropical Depression Eighteen-E while located about 250miles (410km) south-southwest of Huatulco in the state of Oaxaca.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1492 {{with the}} voyages of Christopher Columbus under the {{direction}} of Isabella I of Castile, the Spanish Crown amassed a large American empire over three centuries, spreading first <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> to Central America, most of South America, Mexico, what is today the Southwestern United States, and the Pacific coast of North America up to Alaska. These regions formed the majority of the Viceroyalty of New Spain, the Viceroyalty of Peru, the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata, and the Viceroyalty of New Granada, in each of which the Spanish monarch was represented by a viceroy. By the early 19th century, however, the Spanish sovereign's possessions in the Americas began a series of independence movements, which culminated in the Crown's loss of all its colonies on the mainland of North and South America by 1825. The remaining colonies of Cuba and Puerto Rico were occupied by the United States following the Spanish–American War, ending Spanish rule in the Americas by 1899.|$|E

5|$|Garfield Sobers, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> {{island of}} Barbados, was widely {{regarded}} as one of the world's finest cricketers from the late 1950s to the early 1970s, and is placed by many among the best to ever play the sport. An all-rounder, he made his debut for the West Indies cricket team, the multinational side representing the Caribbean in international cricket, at the age of 17 in 1954. He was a regular member of the team for the next two decades. Sobers set a then-world record highest individual score of 365 runs not out during a Test match against Pakistan in 1958, and became captain of the West Indies team six years later. In domestic first-class cricket, he was one of the first West Indians to play abroad, representing South Australia and Nottinghamshire during the 1960s and 1970s. His batting, bowling and fielding were all regarded as excellent by contemporaries, but his decision making and tactics were occasionally criticised.|$|E
5|$|Hurricane Frank was {{the last}} of three {{hurricane}}s in the 2010 Pacific hurricane season, which set a record low within modern day records for the basin. It formed from an area of thunderstorms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Caribbean</b> Sea, and became Tropical Depression Nine-E on August 21 while located just south of the Mexican Coast. It moved northwest, and became Tropical Storm Frank only 12 hours after it was declared a depression. It strengthened to its initial peak as a moderate tropical storm, and weakened due to increasing wind shear late on the August 23. It later recovered, and became a hurricane on August 25. After peaking as a strong Category 1 hurricane, it rapidly weakened, and dissipated on August 28. Although Frank never made landfall, it did impact western Mexico. A total of six people were killed with over 800,000 people affected.|$|E
