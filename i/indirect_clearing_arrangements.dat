40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been a marked {{expansion}} in the range of products cleared through central counterparty clearing houses, accompanied by a trend towards consolidation in the clearing infrastructure. The financial stability implications of these developments are of considerable policy interest. In this paper, we use a simulation approach to analyse, in a systematic way, the potential pre-settlement cost and risk implications of these developments. Our results point towards substantial risk-reduction benefits from multilateral <b>clearing</b> <b>arrangements,</b> arising from multilateral netting and mutualisation. The paper also examines individual incentives to join multilateral <b>clearing</b> <b>arrangements.</b> We suggest that arrangements with restricted direct participation and tiered membership may be a natural response to the uneven distribution of total pre-settlement costs when agents are of heterogeneous credit quality and it is costly to individually tailor margin. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to capture the}} portfolio incentives for central bank participation in a multilateral trade clearinghouse and to discuss the relation of those incentives to the volume of trade. Clearing­houses for the netting of multilateral intra-regional trade have existed since the 1950 s, but no work to date has attempted to explore the incentive effects of such arrangements. Instead previous work, primarily empirical, {{has focused on the}} tendency of preferential <b>arrangements</b> (<b>clearing</b> as well as favorable protectionist policies) between nations to encourage trade flows between them. This paper advances the notion that the effects of <b>clearing</b> <b>arrangements</b> must be modelled as a portfolio choice problem, in order to ascertain the precise influence of clearing alone.; The model developed here describes the choice of the central bank between holding reserve balances and investing in productive assets. For a given distribution of net export receipts and a given cash management policy of the central bank, expected daily demand for international reserves is derived. This demand is re-derived to illustrate the effects of a clearing­house; in addition, reserve demand is augmented to account for debt payments to external creditors.; Regardless of whether the central bank makes external debt pay­ments, the <b>clearing</b> <b>arrangement</b> reduces the demand for reserves to finance trade. It is possible, were the "freed" reserves invested in development of the export industry, that the <b>clearing</b> <b>arrangement</b> could translate into an increased volume of trade. If the country is burdened with external debt payments however, {{it is possible that the}} "freed" reserves would simply be used to increase payments to external creditors.

40|$|Clearinghouses support {{financial}} trades {{by keeping}} records of transactions and by providing liquidity through short-term credit that is periodically cleared by participants. We study efficient <b>clearing</b> <b>arrangements</b> for formal exchanges, where traders must clear with a clear-inghouse, and for over-the-counter (OTC) markets, where trades can be cleared bilaterally. When clearing is costly, {{we show that}} it can be efficient to subsidize the clearing process for OTC transactions by charging a higher price for the clearing of transactions in exchanges. This necessitates a clearinghouse that operates across both markets. As a clearinghouse offers credit, intertemporal incentives are needed in order to ensure settlement. An increase in the costs of liquidity provision worsens the incentives to settle. Hence, when liquidit...|$|R

The value of the Czech and Slovak Clearing Agreement (CSCA) depended on its ability to relieve pressure on convertible currency reserves and preserve inter-republic trade. The assessment is made by measuring the trend in the Czech and Slovak cases and comparing these results to instances without a bilateral arrangement. The CSCA experience reveals that a more widespread use of bilateral <b>clearing</b> <b>arrangements</b> by other transition economies might have provided little in terms of stability to convertible currency reserves. However, the evidence indicates a more positive effect on inter-republic trade than that attained under a number of non-bilateral scenarios. ...|$|R
