40|$|Graduation date: 1996 Volatile {{compounds}} {{of eight}} pear varieties were isolated and identified by GC/MS. A total of 112 components were identified from headspace of intact fruits, including 47 compounds {{reported for the}} first time in pear. The volatile profiles of these pear varieties were characterized by esters, alcohols, hydrocarbons, aldehydes and ketones. Qualitative and quantitative differences of compounds in the profiles are discussed in terms of flavor differences between pear varieties. Analysis of volatiles isolated from eating-ripe pears by direct sniffing GC indicated that a group of nine esters including 2 -methylpropyl-, butyl-, pentyl- and <b>hexyl</b> <b>acetates,</b> butyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, methyl trans- 2, cis- 4 -, ethyl trans- 2, cis- 4 - and ethyl cis- 2, cis- 4 - decadienoates from 'Bartlett', 'Cornice' and 'Anjou' pear possessed strong, specific pear-like aroma. A second group of esters was also found to possess very positive aroma and can significantly affect overall sensation by serving as 'contributory to flavor compounds'. A newly developed, solid-phase microextraction technique was used to follow changes of volatile production of 'Bartlett', 'Packham's Triumph' and 'Anjou' pears during ripening. The major esters were found to increase at different rates and times during fruit ripening. Highly significant correlations between specific groups of odor-active compounds and pear flavor intensity during ripening indicated the significant contribution of volatiles to overall pear flavor. The effects of harvest maturity on volatiles differed between fruit varieties. 'Bartlett' harvested at all maturities, upon ripening produced similar amounts of flavor constituents. Higher volatile production was observed in early harvested 'Packham's Triumph'. Delayed harvest significantly reduced volatile production in 'Anjou'. Prolonged storage of fruits resulted in severe reduction of volatile esters in 'Packham's Triumph' and 'Anjou'. Alcohol acyltransferase, the ester synthesizing enzyme was isolated from 'Bartlett', partially purified, and its properties characterized. The enzyme was estimated to have a molecular weight of 40 kD and was most active at pH 7. 5 and 3 O°C. The enzyme has Km= 0. 6 mM and Vmax = 0. 3 nmol/min for hexanol and Km= 53 μM and Vmax = 0. 2 nmol/min for acetyl-CoA.

In this library of compounds the bulkier substituents distort {{the geometry of}} the chromophores and shift the lowest energy absorption band {{as a consequence of}} reduced π–π stacking and inter-chromophore overlap. Longitudinal displacement of the conjugated core is affected by donor–acceptor intermolecular interactions and twisting of the thiophene ring out of the plane of the DPP core, whereas lateral displacement was correlated to distortion of the NLactam–C(R) bond out of the plane of the DPP core. The di-substituted TDPP with hexyl units exhibit high molecular planarity, strong close packing of the conjugated core and significant red shift of the maximum of absorption in the solid, whereas the mono-substituted compounds with <b>hexyl</b> and ethyl <b>acetate</b> units are the least distorted of the series because of strong intermolecular hydrogen bonding that increases the molecular overlap and planarity of the chromophores.

40|$|Compared {{to other}} melon types, Cantaloupe Charentais melons are highly {{aromatic}} {{with a major}} contribution to the aroma being made by aliphatic and branched esters. Using a transgenic line in which the synthesis of the plant hormone ethylene has been considerably lowered by antisense ACC oxidase mRNA (AS), the aliphatic ester pathway steps at which ethylene exerts its regulatory role were found. The data show that the production of aliphatic esters such as <b>hexyl</b> and butyl <b>acetate</b> was blocked in AS fruit and could be reversed by ethylene. Using fruit discs incubated {{in the presence of}} various precursors, the steps at which ester formation was inhibited in AS fruit was shown to be the reduction of fatty acids and aldehydes, the last step of acetyl transfer to alcohols being unaffected. However, treating AS fruit with the ethylene antagonist 1 -methylcyclopropene resulted in about 50 % inhibition of acetyl transfer activity, indicating that this portion of activity was ethylene-dependent and this was supported by the low residual ethylene concentration of AS fruit discs (around 2 µl l- 1). In conclusion, the reduction of fatty acids and aldehydes appears essentially to be ethylene-dependent, whilst the last step of alcohol acetylation has ethylene-dependent and ethylene-independent components, probably corresponding to differentially regulated alcohol acetyltransferases...|$|R

The impact of O. oeni esterases remains relatively unexplored. Four esterase genes were identified from O. oeni genome (estA 2, estA 7, estC, and estB). The dual objective of this study was, first to use a genetic tool enabling the expression of esterase genes in enological conditions and, second, to investigate the impact of O. oeni esterase gene expression during winemaking on wine aromatic profile. Both estA 2 and estA 7 genes were successfully cloned and expressed in O. oeni and recombinant strains were inoculated in Aligote wine to initiate malolactic fermentation (MLF).

In addition, untreated samples were analyzed {{to be used as}} a control. Although the target esters were differently affected by the three treatments depending on the ester considered, a general trend could be observed. The levels of ethyl 2 -methyl butanoate and isoamyl acetate decreased significantly with respect to the control sample with both (-) -methyl jasmonate and (+) -methyl jasmonate treatments. However, the variation in the concentrations of ethyl hexanoate and <b>hexyl</b> <b>acetate</b> depended on whether the (-) - or the (+) -enantiomer of methyl jasmonate was used in the treatment.

Changes in aroma after RA and CA storage {{were characterized by}} Osme and descriptive sensory analysis (DSA). <b>Hexyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> butyl acetate and 2 -methylbutyl acetate were emitted in the largest amounts and were perceived with the strongest intensities, with "ripe apple", "solvent" and "fruity" descriptors. Production of <b>hexyl</b> <b>acetate</b> and butyl acetate after CA storage decreased significantly compared to apples stored in RA, along with perceived intensities. 2 -Methylbutyl acetate only decreased in apples stored 20 weeks in CA. Other esters with an apple odor were butyl 2 -methylbutyrate and hexyl 2 -methylbutyrate. Methyl 2 -methylbutyrate, ethyl 2 -methylbutyrate and propyl 2 -methylbutyrate had sweet, fruity, and berry-like odors. Ester production after CA storage decreased at different rates. The non-ester compounds 4 -allylanisole (anise) and 0 -damascenone (grape juice) {{as well as an}} unidentified compound (watermelon), were perceived mostly from RA stored fruit. Other unidentified peaks had cucumber, mushroom, adhesive tape or skunk odors. Comparison of mixtures of 'Gala' odor-active compounds in water with whole 'Gala' apples revealed that <b>hexyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> hexanal and butyl acetate were necessary to impart an apple odor. 2 -Methylbutyl acetate and methyl 2 -methylbutyrate also contributed to the least difference between mixture solutions and apples. DSA of 'Gala' apples stored in RA and CA confirmed the general decrease in fruity aroma following CA storage. A floral descriptor was also significantly affected by CA storage. A musty note appeared in CA stored fruit, which may have corresponded to a garlic odorant peak detected during Osme. 'Gala' apples stored 16 weeks in CA followed by 4 weeks in RA emitted more volatiles than fruit stored 20 weeks in CA.

40|$|The {{distinctive}} {{flavor of}} wine, brandy, and other grape-derived alcoholic beverages {{is affected by}} many compounds, including esters produced during alcoholic fermentation. The characteristic fruity odors of the fermentation bouquet are primarily due to a mixture of <b>hexyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> ethyl caproate (apple-like aroma), iso-amyl acetate (banana-like aroma), ethyl caprylate (apple-like aroma), and 2 -phenylethyl acetate (fruity, flowery flavor with a honey note). The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the feasibility of improving the aroma of wine and distillates by overexpressing one of the endogenous yeast genes that controls acetate ester production during fermentation. The synthesis of acetate esters by the wine yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae during fermentation is ascribed to at least three acetyltransferase activities, namely, alcohol acetyltransferase (AAT), ethanol acetyltransferase, and iso-amyl AAT. To investigate the effect of increased AAT activity on the sensory quality of Chenin blanc wines and distillates from Colombar base wines, we have overexpressed the alcohol acetyltransferase gene (ATF 1) of S. cerevisiae. The ATF 1 gene, located on chromosome XV, was cloned from a widely used commercial wine yeast strain of S. cerevisiae, VIN 13, and placed under the control of the constitutive yeast phosphoglycerate kinase gene (PGK 1) promoter and terminator. Chromoblot analysis confirmed the integration of the modified copy of ATF 1 into the genome of three commercial wine yeast strains (VIN 7, VIN 13, and WE 228). Northern blot analysis indicated constitutive expression of ATF 1 at high levels in these yeast transformants. The levels of ethyl acetate, iso-amyl acetate, and 2 -phenylethyl acetate increased 3 - to 10 -fold, 3. 8 - to 12 -fold, and 2 - to 10 -fold, respectively, depending on the fermentation temperature, cultivar, and yeast strain used. The concentrations of ethyl caprate, ethyl caprylate, and <b>hexyl</b> <b>acetate</b> only showed minor changes, whereas the acetic acid concentration decreased by more than half. These changes in the wine and distillate composition had a pronounced effect on the solvent or chemical aroma (associated with ethyl acetate and iso-amyl acetate) and the herbaceous and heads-associated aromas of the final distillate and the solvent or chemical and fruity or flowery characters of the Chenin blanc wines. This study establishes the concept that the overexpression of acetyltransferase genes such as ATF 1 could profoundly affect the flavor profiles of wines and distillates deficient in aroma, thereby paving the way for the production of products maintaining a fruitier character for longer periods after bottling. 10 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Ionized acetates {{were used}} as model {{compounds}} to describe gas-phase behavior of oxygen containing compounds {{with respect to their}} formation of dimers in ion mobility spectrometry (IMS). The ions were created using corona discharge at atmospheric pressure and separated in a drift tube before analysis of the ions by mass spectrometry. At the ambient operational temperature and pressure used in our instrument, all acetates studied formed dimers. Using a homolog series of n-alkyl-acetates, we found that the collision cross section of a dimer was smaller than that of a monomer with the same reduced mass. Our experiments also showed that the reduced mobility of acetate dimers with different functional groups increased in the order n-alkyl ≤ branched chain alkyl ≤ cyclo alkyl < aromat. For mixed n-alkyl dimers we found that the reduced mobility of acetate dimers having the same number of carbons, for example a dimer of acetyl acetate and <b>hexyl</b> <b>acetate</b> has the same reduced mobility as a dimer composed of two butyl acetates. The fundamental behavior of acetate monomers and dimers described in this paper will assist in {{a better understanding of the}} influence of dimer formation in ion mobility spectrometry...|$|E
40|$|International audienceCoupled gas chromatographic-electroantennographic {{detection}} (GC-EAD) {{analyses of}} Super Q collected worker honey bee volatiles revealed several components that elicited antennal responses {{by the small}} hive beetle Aethina tumida. However, GC-MS analysis showed that eight of these EAD-active components dominated the volatile profile released into a wind tunnel by living adult worker honeybees and rubber septa impregnated with a Super Q extract of the volatiles of the bees in a 15 -min bioassay. These components were identified as isopentyl acetate, 2 -heptanone, octanal, <b>hexyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> nonanal, 2 -nonanone, methyl benzoate and decanal. In dual-choice wind tunnel bioassays, the Super Q extract and a blend of the eight components elicited dose-dependent upwind responses from beetles relative to a solvent control. At 375 -bee day equivalents, the Super Q extract and the 8 -component blend elicited 76 and 74 % upwind response, respectively, which compared with 84 % response from approx. 150 - 200 living worker honey bees. In contrast, the Super Q extract and the 8 -component blend lured only approx. 12 and 3 % of beetles, respectively, into a trap compared to 48 % by the odor from living adult worker bees...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} {{was aimed at}} determining {{if there were any}} changes in the volatile profile of strawberries cv. Camarosa, when subjected to various freezing and thawing treatments. Strawberries were cut in half, one half of the berries were frozen directly at - 20 °C or - 80 °C or rapidly frozen in liquid nitrogen (N 2) (- 196 °C). They were then stored overnight or for a week. Berries were later left to thaw at room temperature (natural thawing) for about 1 h and some were forced-thawed in a 30 °C water bath. Headspace volatile compounds were determined using an Atmospheric Pressure Chemical Ionisation-Mass Spectrometer (APCI-GPA) and validated with a Gas Chromatograph-Mass Spectrometer (GC-MS). In a comparison of thawed half berries and fresh berries, most esters such as <b>hexyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> ethyl methyl hexanoate, methyl acetate were increased significantly by week-long and not by overnight freeze/thaw treatments. Ethyl butyrate was not affected by any treatment. The abundance of aldehydes such as the acetaldehyde compounds was increased significantly when thawed naturally compared to when forced-thawed in all the cold storage treatments. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{discrimination}} study {{based on the}} antioxidant compounds, oxidative stability, aroma and sensory profiles of virgin olive oils from the main Tunisian cultivars, Chemlali and Chétoui, grown in two different locations, north and south Tunisia, with important differences in altitude, latitude and climatic conditions. There were {{significant differences between the}} oils from both cultivars when grown in the different environments. At higher altitude, the oils showed a greater amount of oleic acid, phenols and a higher stability, whilst in the open the oils had higher saturated and linoleic acid content. Aroma profiles were also influenced by the pedoclimatic conditions; hence, oils from the South had the highest level of (E) - 2 -hexenal and 1 -hexanol, whereas varieties from the North were higher in (E) - 3 -hexenyl acetate and <b>hexyl</b> <b>acetate.</b> In general, and independently of the growing area conditions, oils from Chétoui olives had higher levels of antioxidants, greater oxidative stability, higher antiradical activities and more marked intensity of bitterness. These results can be used to discriminate and to characterise the Chemlali and Chétoui olive oils from each region...|$|E
40|$|Two {{analytical}} methods based on gas chromatography with direct injection are described for the quantitative analysis of volatile compounds (acetals, aldehydes, esters, alcohols, and volatile phenols) in cider brandies. Analytes {{were divided into}} major, 15, and minor volatile, 24, compounds depending on their usual concentration in samples. Parameters usually tested for method validation are evaluated. Correlation coefficients are calculated to estimate linearity, obtaining values higher than 0. 999. Detection limits range between 0. 325 mg/L (1 -propanol) and 1. 663 mg/L (methanol) among the major volatile compounds and between 0. 086 mg/L (ethyl 2 -methylbutyrate) and 0. 332 mg/L (ethyl tetradecanoate) among the minor volatiles. Mean recoveries ranged between 109 % (ethyl lactate) and 95 % (1 -butanol) for major volatiles and between 109 % (1 -octen- 3 -ol) and 94 % (ethyl 2 -methylbutyrate) for minor volatiles, thus confirming the accuracy of both methods. Reproducibility for major volatiles is < 5. 4 % (furfural) in all cases and < 9. 6 % (<b>hexyl</b> <b>acetate)</b> for minor volatiles. Moreover, {{the accuracy of the}} methods is evaluated by analyzing a certified whisky and five samples from interlaboratory assays, generally obtaining results in accordance with previous values...|$|E
40|$|The {{profile of}} {{volatile}} compounds of yellow {{passion fruit juice}} was analyzed by solid phase microextraction headspace (HS-SPME) and optimized static headspace (S-HS) extraction techniques. Time, temperature, NaCl concentration and sample volume headspace equilibrium parameters was adjusted to the S-HS technique. The gaseous phase in the headspace of samples was collected and injected into a gas chromatograph coupled to a mass spectrometer. In the HS-SPME technique was identified 44 volatile compounds from the yellow passion fruit juice, but with S-HS only 30 compounds were identified. Volatile esters were majority in both techniques, being identified ethyl butanoate, ethyl hexanoate, (3 z) - 3 -hexenyl acetate, <b>hexyl</b> <b>acetate,</b> hexyl butanoate and hexyl hexanoate. Aldehydes and ketones were not identified in S-HS, but were in HS-SPME. &# 946;-Pinene, p-cymene, limonene, (Z) -&# 946;-ocimene, (E) -&# 946;-ocimene, &# 947;-terpinene, &# 945;-terpinolene and (E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 - nonatriene terpenes were identified in both techniques. This study showed that the S-HS optimized extraction technique was effective to recovery high concentrations of the major volatile characteristics compounds in the passion fruit, such as ethyl butanoate and ethyl hexanoate, which can be advantageous due to {{the simplicity of the}} method...|$|E
