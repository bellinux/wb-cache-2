It consists of 3 different games: 30 Second Blitz, where the goal is to get as many points as possible within 30 seconds; 25 Point Rush, where the player must get 25 points as fast as possible; and Bull's-Eye Ace, where the player tries to get a large percentage of bull's-eyes.|$|E
50|$|A {{compressed}} gas accumulator {{consists of a}} cylinder with two chambers that are separated by an <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> a totally enclosed bladder, or a floating piston. One chamber contains hydraulic fluid and {{is connected to the}} hydraulic line. The other chamber contains an inert gas under pressure (typically nitrogen) that provides the compressive force on the hydraulic fluid. Inert gas is used because oxygen and oil can form an explosive mixture when combined under high pressure. As the volume of the {{compressed gas}} changes, the pressure of the gas (and the pressure on the fluid) changes inversely.|$|E
5000|$|The {{manometric}} flame apparatus {{consisted of}} a chamber which acted {{in the same way}} as a modern microphone. Sound from the source to be measured was concentrated by means of a horn or tube into one half of the capsule chamber. The chamber was divided in two by an <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragm,</b> usually rubber. The sound caused the diaphragm to vibrate which modulated a flow of flammable illumination gas passing through the other half of the chamber. The illumination gas was passed to a Bunsen burner, the flame of which would then increase or decrease in size at the same frequency as the sound source.|$|E

In this paper, a new instrument is designed to accomplish the purpose of localizing the sound source by a relatively compact structure. This bionics structure is designed to mimic the localization function of the ears of the parasitoid fly Ormia ochracea, and it consists of three <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragms,</b> three bars which connected to the diaphragms, and the other mechanical components. The analysis of this structureâ€™s dynamic behavior shows that the incident angles of the sound have special relationship to the responses of this instrument, and the incident angles can be estimated by detecting the vibrations of the three <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragms.</b> Compared with traditional microphone arrays, this instrument {{has the advantage of}} compaction and higher integrated level...|$|R

50|$|The diagram to {{the right}} shows {{the design of a}} basic valve, {{controlling}} the flow of water in this example. At the top figure is the valve in its closed state. The water under pressure enters at A. B is an <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> and above it is a weak spring pushing it down. The diaphragm has a pinhole through its center which allows a very small amount of water to flow through it. This water fills the cavity C {{on the other side of}} the diaphragm so that pressure is equal on both sides of the diaphragm, however the compressed spring supplies a net downward force. The spring is weak and is only able to close the inlet because water pressure is equalized on both sides of the diaphragm.|$|E
50|$|The {{metal bellows}} {{accumulators}} function similarly to the compressed gas type, except the <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> or floating piston {{is replaced by}} a hermetically sealed welded metal bellows. Fluid may be internal or external to the bellows. The advantages to the metal bellows type include exceptionally low spring rate, allowing the gas charge to do all the work with little change in pressure from full to empty, and a long stroke relative to solid (empty) height, which gives maximum storage volume for a given container size. The welded metal bellows accumulator provides an exceptionally high level of accumulator performance, and can be produced with a broad spectrum of alloys resulting in a broad range of fluid compatibility. Another advantage to this type {{is that it does not}} face issues with high pressure operation, thus allowing more energy storage capacity.|$|E
50|$|NIHL {{occurs when}} too much sound {{intensity}} is transmitted into {{and through the}} auditory system. An acoustic signal from a sound source, such as a radio, enters into the external auditory canal, and is funneled through to the tympanic membrane (eardrum). The tympanic membrane acts as an <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> driving the ossicular chain {{of the middle ear}} system into motion. The middle ear ossicles transfer mechanical energy to the cochlea by way of the stapes footplate hammering against the oval window of the cochlea. This hammering causes the fluid within the cochlea (perilymph and endolymph) to push against the stereocilia of the hair cells, which then transmit a signal to the central auditory system within the brain. Different groups of hair cells are responsive to and conductive of different frequencies. There are two known biological mechanisms of NIHL from excessive sound intensity: damage to the hair cells and damage to the myelination or synaptic regions of auditory nerves.|$|E

A method based on frequency analysis of the acoustic signal obtained from an air-driven pump during operation is described in this paper. A fully digital system for frequency analysis based on a personal computer was developed for practical implementation of this method. The system was tested under laboratory and in plant conditions. Two types of laboratory tests were performed: tests performed on diaphragm containing different types of artificial flaws and tests performed on different types of diaphragm. Three tests were performed under in plant conditions. The main goal of these tests were to demonstrate {{the ability of the}} system in early failure detection of the pump. The tests were performed under very high level of background noise and lasted between two days and two weeks in length.

However, at least for the numerical simulation of the operation of single microsystem components, such as mechanical resonators, thermo-elements, <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragms,</b> reliable simulation tools are available. For the different engineering disciplines (like electronics, mechanics, optics, etc) a lot of CAD-tools for the design, simulation and verification of specific devices are available, but there is noCAD-environment within which we could perform a (micro-) system simulation due to the different nature of the devices. In general there are two different approaches to overcome this limitation: the first possibility would be to develop a new framework tailored formicrosystem engineering. The second approach, much more realistic, would be to use the existing CAD-tools which contain the most promising features, and to extend these tools {{so that they can be}} used for the simulation and verification of microsystems and of the devices involved.

50|$|The cell uses {{conventional}} piston and cylinder arrangement. The piston {{is placed}} in a thin <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragm.</b> The piston doesn't actually {{come in contact with}} the load cell. Mechanical stops are placed to prevent over strain of the diaphragm when the loads exceed certain limit. The load cell is completely filled with oil. When the load is applied on the piston, the movement of the piston and the diaphragm results in an increase of oil pressure. This pressure is then transmitted to a hydraulic pressure gauge via a high pressure hose. The gauge's Bourdon tube senses the pressure and registers it on the dial. Because this sensor has no electrical components, it is ideal for use in hazardous areas. Typical hydraulic load cell applications include tank, bin, and hopper weighing. By example, a hydraulic load cell is immune to transient voltages (lightning) so these type of load cells might be a more effective device in outdoor environments. This technology is more expensive than other types of load cells. It is a more costly technology and thus cannot effectively compete on a cost of purchase basis.|$|E
50|$|A {{pressure}} vessel 6 containing air cushions the hydraulic pressure shock when the waste valve closes, {{and it also}} improves the pumping efficiency by allowing a more constant flow through the delivery pipe. Although the pump could in theory work without it, the efficiency would drop drastically and the pump {{would be subject to}} extraordinary stresses that could shorten its life considerably. One problem is that the pressurized air will gradually dissolve into the water until none remains. One solution to this problem is to have the air separated from the water by an <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> (similar to an expansion tank); however, this solution can be problematic in developing countries where replacements are difficult to procure. Another solution is to have a mechanism such as a snifting valve that automatically inserts a small bubble of air when the suction pulse mentioned above reaches the pump. Another solution is to insert an inner tube of a car or bicycle tire into the {{pressure vessel}} with some air in it and the valve closed. This tube is in effect the same as the diaphragm, but it is implemented with more widely available materials. The air in the tube cushions the shock of the water the same as the air in other configurations does.|$|E

40|$|The {{in-plane}} fl exibility of untopped {{precast concrete}} double-tee diaphragms is often ignored in current design practice. The performance of parking structures during earthquakes and subsequent research studies have shown, however, that in-plane fl exibility of diaphragms {{may contribute to}} the development of large displacements, a concern for stability. The objective of this paper is to provide designers with a practical approach to judge the linear elastic in-plane fl exibility of discretely connected untopped double-tee diaphragms. Based on the results of detailed fi nite element model analyses of commonly used untopped diaphragms, a simplifi ed rational approximation is used to establish equivalent beam models. Methods of defi ning linear elastic stiffness parameters of the equivalent beam are derived and can be directly used in manual calculations or computer analysis.

40|$|Lab-on-a-disc is {{a unique}} {{microfluidic}} platform that utilizes centrifugal force to pump liquids. This offers many benefits for point-of-care devices because it {{eliminates the need for}} connections to multiple pumps and complex tubing connections. Broad applications including clinical chemistry, immunoassay, cell analysis, as well as nucleic acid tests, could be demonstrated on a spinning disc. To enable the performance of assays in a fully integrated and automated manner, the robust actuation of integrated valves is a prerequisite. However, conventional passive type of valves incur a critical drawback in that their operation is dependent on the rotational frequency, which is easily influenced by the channel geometry and chemistry, in addition to the physical properties of the liquids to be transferred. Even though a few active type valving techniques permit the individual actuation of valves, independent of the rotational frequency, complex procedures for the fabrication as well as actuation mechanisms have prevented their broader acceptance in general applications. Here, we report on lab-on-a-disc incorporating individually addressable diaphragm valves (ID valves), which enable the reversible and thermally stable actuation of multiple valves with unprecedented ease and robustness. An ID valve is configured from an <b>elastic</b> epoxy <b>diaphragm</b> embedded on a 3 D printed push-and-twist valve, which can be easily actuated by a simple automatic driver unit.

40|$|A {{tactile display}} device {{utilizes}} an electrorheological fluid to activate {{a plurality of}} tactile dots. A voltage is selectively produced uniformly across an electrorheological fluid flowing between a common ground electrode and a plurality of conductive dot electrodes, thereby producing {{an increase in the}} fluid's viscosity to the extent that fluid flow between the two electrodes is restricted. The flow restriction produces a build-up of electrorheological fluid in a corresponding dot actuator chamber. The resulting pressure increase in the chamber displaces an <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> fixed to a display surface to form a lump which can be perceived by the reader as one dot in a Braille character cell. A flow regulation system provides a continually pressurized flow system and provides for free flow of the electrorheological fluid through the plurality of dot actuator chambers when they are not activated. The device is adaptable to printed circuit techniques and can simultaneously display tactile dots representative of a full page of Braille characters stored on a medium such as a tape cassette or to display tactile dots representative of non-Braille data appearing on a computer monitor or contained on another data storage medium.

40|$|Existing {{methods of}} {{analyzing}} lateral force demands on structures during seismic events {{do not fully}} contemplate the amplification caused by diaphragm flexibility. Moreover, commonly used code provisions do not conservatively anticipate floor demands generated in shear wall buildings. In buildings with floors that act as rigid diaphragms, elastic response necessitates the accurate estimation of design forces, which is currently not provided with an equivalent lateral force analysis. In long span structures with perimeter walls, diaphragm flexibility may result in amplified floor demands. This amplification was addressed while investigating <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> demands in precast concrete buildings. Modal response spectrum analysis formulated {{the basis of the}} elastic design. A modified version of the modal first mode reduced method proposed by RodrÃ­guez et al.

This method conservatively estimates the design forces necessary for <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> response at the design earthquake hazard. Diaphragm demands were assessed in a large scope analytical with the proposed design method. Results show this method sufficiently bounds demands for rigid floor systems or for systems whose flexibility is included. An experimental program supported the analytical study providing in-plane diaphragm stiffness characteristics of a precast concrete building. A complete structural system was tested at 54 % scale with unique diaphragm systems on each of its three floors. Hybrid rocking walls minimized residual drift and allowed customized nonlinear wall behavior at different hazards. Extensive testing and abundant instrumentation generated valuable information regarding the seismic performance of precast concrete systems.

Floors and roofs of buildings are modeled using 4 -node <b>elastic</b> <b>diaphragm</b> elements. The procedure utilizes an iteration strategy applied to an implicit time-integration scheme to solve the nonlinear equations of motion at each time-step. Geometric nonlinearity is included. The plastic hinge beam element consists of two nodes at which biaxial flexural yielding is permitted, leading {{to the formation of}} plastic hinges. Elastic rotational springs are connected across the plastic hinge locations to model strain-hardening. Axial yielding is also permitted. A normalized PMM interaction surface is calculated for one of the model sections, and used to characterize the axial force-biaxial moment interaction for all model sections. The panel zone element consists of two orthogonal panels forming a cruciform section. Each panel may yield and strain-harden in shear. The elastofiber beam element is divided into three segments - two end nonlinear segments and an interior elastic segment. The cross-sections of the end segments are subdivided into fibers. Associated with each fiber is a nonlinear hysteretic stress-strain law for axial stress and strain. This accounts for coupling of nonlinear material behavior between bending about the major and minor axes of the cross-section and axial deformation. While beams and columns in moment-frames can be modeled using the elastofiber beam element, braces and columns susceptible to buckling may be modeled using a modified elastofiber beam element with the elastic segment in the standard elastofiber beam element subdivided into two elastic segments and a central nonlinear segment. First mode buckling in the element is simulated through yielding of the central nonlinear segment. All these elements are integrated into a building analysis program, FRAME 3 D.
