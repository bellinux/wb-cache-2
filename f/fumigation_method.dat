40|$|The {{impact of}} {{decreased}} biodiversity on ecosystem stability, or the diversity-stability (D-S) relationship, {{is one of}} the major concerns of modern ecological studies. Studies on the D-S relationship for soil microbial communities began in 2000 when the <b>fumigation</b> <b>method</b> was developed to generate different levels of soil microbial biodiversity. The studies used various measures and levels of biodiversity, and covered several functional parameters. Due to the lack of general concepts and reliable approaches to define microbial species, studies on the D-S relationship of soil microbial communities concentrate on genetic diversity and functional diversity more than species diversity. Contradictory results were observed in various studies on D-S relationship with possible factors affecting or even changing the directions of the D-S relationship including: (1) the methods of stability measurement, (2) the techniques in microbial diversity measurement, (3) the measures and levels of diversity, (4) the type and strength of disturbance, (5) the traits of functions, and (6) the hidden treatments stemming from diversity manipulation. We argue that future studies should take diversity, species composition and interaction, and soil environmental conditions holistically into account in D-S studies to develop modeling to predict soil functional stability.

Three main questions are researched: (i) does a higher tree species diversity result in a higher microbial functional diversity and/or microbial biomass, (ii) are different humus forms characterized by different microbial communities, and (iii) is there a relation between tree species diversity and humus form and what is the importance of the microbial community in this relation? Data from six study sites within Europe are used. On each study site plots are selected that differ in tree species richness. For each plot the diversity and identity of the tree species mixture and humus form is known. To characterize the microbial community, soil composite samples are taken on each plot.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate basal (BR) and specific respirations (qCO 2) of soils under native pasture and long-term cultivated soils at semiarid climate of the northern Turkey. In addition, the dependencies of BR to soil water content and the relationship between microbial biomass C (Cmic) and qCO 2 were determined in the both ecosystems. Soil samples were collected from 0 - 5, 5 - 15, and 15 - 30 cm layers of native pasture and long-term cultivated soils. Soil microbial biomass was determined using <b>fumigation</b> incubation <b>method.</b> Specific respiration was calculated as BR/Cmic. BR varied through growth season in the both ecosystems and native pasture generally had greater BR than long-term cultivated soil. The highest BR was observed in October at native pasture. However, qCO 2 was generally greater in long-term cultivated soil compared to native pasture. qCO 2 and Cmic were negatively correlated at all layers of both management systems. There was not a significant dependency between soil water content and BR in Fluvaquentic Haplustolls. Thus, long-term cultivation increased qCO 2 which varied through growth season. Soil organisms under stress condition increased qCO 2 compared to native pasture...|$|R
40|$|The {{occurrence}} of heterotrophic CO 2 fixation by soil microorganisms was tested in several mineral soils differing in pH and two artificial soils (a mixture of silica sand, alfalfa powder, and nutrient medium inoculated with a soil suspension). Soils were incubated at ambient (~ 0. 05 vol%) and elevated (~ 5 vol%) CO 2 concentrations under aerobic conditions {{for up to}} 21 days. CO 2 fixation was detected using either a technique for determining the natural abundance of 13 C or by measuring the distribution of labeled 14 C-CO 2 in soil and bacteria. The effects of elevated CO 2 on microbial biomass (direct counts, chloroform <b>fumigation</b> extraction <b>method),</b> composition of microbial community (phospholipid fatty acids), microbial activity (respiration, dehydrogenase activity), and turnover rate were also measured. Heterotrophic CO 2 fixation was proven in all soils under study, being higher in neutral soils. The main portion of the fixed CO 2 (98 – 99 %) was found in extracellular metabolites while only ~ 1 % CO 2 was incorporated into microbial cells. High CO 2 concentration always induced an increase in microbial activity, changes {{in the composition of}} the microbial community, and a decrease in microbial turnover. The results suggest that heterotrophic CO 2 fixation could be a widespread process in soils...|$|R
