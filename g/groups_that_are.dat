5|$|Eight of Arizona's fifteen {{counties}} are named after various Native American <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> resident {{in parts of}} what is now Arizona, with another (Cochise County) being named after a native leader. Four other counties, Gila County, Santa Cruz County, Pinal County, and Graham County, are named for physical features of Arizona's landscape: the Gila River, the Santa Cruz River, Pinal Peak, and Mount Graham, respectively. Another county, La Paz County, is named after a former settlement, while the final county, Greenlee County, is named after one of the state's early pioneers.|$|E
5|$|Japanese ethnographer Ino Kanori {{was charged}} {{with the task of}} {{surveying}} the entire population of Taiwanese aborigines, applying the first systematic study of aborigines on Taiwan. Ino's research {{is best known for his}} formalization of eight peoples of Taiwanese aborigines: Atayal, Bunun, Saisiat, Tsou, Paiwan, Puyuma, Ami and Pepo (Pingpu). This is the direct antecedent of the taxonomy used today to distinguish people <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> officially recognized by the government.|$|E
5|$|MS is {{more common}} in people who live farther from the equator, {{although}} exceptions exist. These exceptions include ethnic <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> at low risk far from the equator such as the Samis, Amerindians, Canadian Hutterites, New Zealand Māori, and Canada's Inuit, as well as groups that have a relatively high risk close to the equator such as Sardinians, inland Sicilians, Palestinians and Parsis. The cause of this geographical pattern is not clear. While the north-south gradient of incidence is decreasing, as of 2010 it is still present.|$|E
50|$|Statistically speaking, the <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> {{one-third of}} the {{population}} is the one most likely to persist and the <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> two-thirds the one most likely to dissolve into splinter groups, as if reacting to the cohesiveness of the <b>group</b> <b>that</b> <b>is</b> one-third.|$|R

5|$|The oldest {{confidently}} identified parasitic flatworm fossils are cestode eggs {{found in}} a Permian shark coprolite, but helminth hooks still attached to Devonian acanthodians and placoderms might also represent parasitic flatworms with simple life cycles. The oldest known free-living platyhelminth specimen is a fossil preserved in Eocene age Baltic amber {{and placed in the}} monotypic species Micropalaeosoma balticus, while the oldest subfossil specimens are schistosome eggs discovered in ancient Egyptian mummies. The Platyhelminthes have very few synapomorphies, distinguishing features that all Platyhelminthes and no other animals have. This makes it difficult to work out both their relationships with other groups of animals and the relationships between different <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> described as members of the Platyhelminthes.|$|E
5|$|Within the Malacostraca, no fossils {{are known}} for krill, while both Hoplocarida and Phyllopoda contain {{important}} <b>groups</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> now extinct as well as extant members (Hoplocarida: mantis shrimp are extant, while Aeschronectida are extinct; Phyllopoda: Canadaspidida are extinct, while Leptostraca are extant). Cumacea and Isopoda are both known from the Carboniferous, as are the first true mantis shrimp. In the Decapoda, prawns and polychelids appear in the Triassic, and shrimp and crabs appear in the Jurassic; however, the great radiation of crustaceans occurred in the Cretaceous, particularly in crabs, {{and may have been}} driven by the adaptive radiation of their main predators, bony fish. The first true lobsters also appear in the Cretaceous.|$|E
