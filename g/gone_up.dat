5|$|The {{literacy}} rate in Dhaka is also increasing quickly. It {{was estimated at}} 69.2% in 2001. The {{literacy rate}} had <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> to 74.6% by 2011 which is {{significantly higher than the}} national average of 51.77%.|$|E
5|$|About 200 free {{wireless}} access points {{were set up}} around the city to aid with the city's goal of increasing access to the internet. US Internet paid $500,000 up front and agreed to pay five percent of its yearly revenues for seven years to maintain them, totaling about $10 million. By 2010, 44 such points {{had been set up}} at community centers around Minneapolis, {{out of a total of}} 117 which had also <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> in parks and on street corners around the city. Per the request of law enforcement officials who were concerned about the potential ability to surf the internet anonymously, the free login points require the user to enter a username, password, and credit card number.|$|E
5|$|Leaving Russia before Reed, {{who wanted}} {{to report on the}} Bolshevik debate about Russian {{participation}} in the war with Germany, Bryant returned to New York, arriving on February 18, 1918. She found Greenwich Village much changed by the war; old friends had moved, rents had <b>gone</b> <b>up,</b> and tourists were replacing bohemians. Under government pressure, The Masses had shut down. Working out of a room at the Brevoort Hotel, Bryant wrote articles about the October Revolution and speeches or cables urging support of the workers' government in Russia.|$|E

50|$|What we {{can gather}} from {{this is the}} {{understanding}} of why an increased budget deficit <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> and down {{in tandem with the}} Trade Deficit. This is where we derive the appellation the Twin Deficits: if the US budget deficit <b>goes</b> <b>up</b> then either household savings must <b>go</b> <b>up,</b> the trade deficit must <b>go</b> <b>up,</b> or private investment will decrease.|$|R
5|$|One World Trade Center is principally {{owned by}} the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. Around 5percent equity of the {{building}} was sold to the Durst Organization, a private real estate company, in exchange for an investment of at least $100million. The Durst Organization assisted in supervising the building's construction, and manages the building for the Port Authority, having responsibility for leasing, property management, and tenant installations. By September 2012, around 55percent of the building's floor space had been leased, but no new leases were signed for three years until May 2014; the amount of space leased had <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> to 62.8percent by November 2014.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of decades or centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> {{and down in the}} past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.|$|E
5|$|Later, it was {{announced}} that should a sequel or reboot not start filming by October 10, 2012, the rights to the Daredevil franchise would revert from Fox back to Marvel. In early August 2012, Fox scrambled to find a replacement for David Slade, who dropped out of the director's chair due to scheduling conflicts. The studio briefly met with Joe Carnahan, for the job—however, Carnahan said on Twitter that his pitch, described as a hard-boiled '70s thriller, had <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> in smoke. Several sources commented that Fox had given up on the reboot, and were prepared to let the rights revert to Marvel and their parent company, The Walt Disney Company. On April 23, 2013, Kevin Feige confirmed that the rights for Daredevil returned to Marvel Studios and Disney, opening the possibility of including the character into the Marvel Cinematic Universe. That speculation was confirmed with the announcement of an original Netflix Daredevil television series, which premiered on the streaming service in April 2015, with English actor Charlie Cox in the title role.|$|E

5|$|Wells {{had survived}} {{the death of his}} first wife and all four of his brothers; he also had no children, leaving him without a clear heir. His estate was further {{complicated}} by his lack of a will. Accordingly, under New York law at the time, his holdings were divided among his widow, fifteen nephews and one grand nephew. They decided to subdivide and sell the property, and within a few years more buildings had <b>gone</b> <b>up,</b> {{just in time for the}} construction of the Hudson River Railroad in 1848, which laid its track on a causeway right across the river's mouth. Over the next several decades, as Yonkers' population grew rapidly, leading it to incorporate as a village and then, in 1872, a city, the rest of the estuary was filled in and narrowed and the bluffs on its south side graded out of existence.|$|E
5|$|Centered on Post Oak Boulevard and Westheimer Road, the Uptown District boomed {{during the}} 1970s and early 1980s when a {{collection}} of midrise office buildings, hotels, and retail developments appeared along Interstate610 West. Uptown {{became one of the}} most prominent instances of an edge city. The tallest building in Uptown is the 64-floor, -tall, Philip Johnson and John Burgee designed landmark Williams Tower (known as the Transco Tower until 1999). At the time of construction, it was believed to be the world's tallest skyscraper outside a central business district. The new 20-story Skanska building and BBVA Compass Plaza are the newest office buildings built in Uptown after 30years. The Uptown District is also home to buildings designed by noted architects I. M. Pei, César Pelli, and Philip Johnson. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a mini-boom of midrise and highrise residential tower construction occurred, with several over 30 stories tall. Since 2000 more than 30 high-rise buildings have <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> in Houston; all told, 72 high-rises tower over the city, which adds up to about 8,300 units. In 2002, Uptown had more than 23million square feet (2,100,000m²) of office space with 16million square feet (1,500,000m²) of class A office space.|$|E
5|$|The 2011–12 season started {{much as the}} {{previous}} one had ended, with Blackburn taking until 17 September to win a match, a 4–3 victory at home to Arsenal. On 20 November, Robinson won a penalty against Wigan; the goalkeeper had <b>gone</b> <b>up</b> to the Wigan box for a late corner, and was kicked in the face by Wigan midfielder David Jones. The penalty was scored by Yakubu to level the score at 3–3. In a repeat of {{the previous}} season, Robinson conceded seven goals as Blackburn lost an away match 7–1, this time to Arsenal, on 4 February 2012. A run of 30 matches without a clean sheet was finally ended in a 2–0 win against Wolverhampton Wanderers, a match which also took Blackburn out of the relegation zone, whilst another 2–0 win, this time against Sunderland, was the first time Robinson had kept back-to-back clean sheets since August 2010. Blackburn, however, would only score three points more all season and were relegated to the Championship after finishing in 19th position. In contrast to the two previous seasons where Robinson had averaged ten league clean sheets a season, he kept just three clean sheets in the league, having played 34 matches. All three clean sheets came from matches where Blackburn won 2–0. Following the departures of Christopher Samba and Ryan Nelsen from Ewood Park, Robinson became the Blackburn captain, initially on a temporary basis but later as the permanent captain.|$|E
