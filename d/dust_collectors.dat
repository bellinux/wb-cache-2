Scientists simultaneously measured dust concentrations with the personal samplers and two <b>dust</b> <b>collectors</b> - without mask and in the facepiece. Also, they measured the proportion of time, then the respirators were used by miners. For this purpose, two thermistor (one in the facepiece, {{the other on the}} belt) were used; over-heating PTC with expired air was a sign of wearing a mask. Because convenience of the respirators affect on the timeliness of its usage, scientists have studied the opinion of the miners on the use of respirators. A detailed report was published before the publication of the article.|$|E

FINDING THE DUST SOURCE AND LOOKING FOR VENTILATION MALFUNCTIONS [The first steps in fighting a dust problem are to take dust samples to pinpoint the source, check the ventilation system, and check the <b>dust</b> <b>collector.</b> Without knowing the exact source, efforts to reduce dust are hit-and-miss (mostly miss). ] Taking samples to pinpoint the dust source. In tunnels {{with high levels of}} airborne dust, the first task is to pinpoint where the dust enters the airstream. Most dust originates from rock breakage at the tunnel face, but the location where this dust enters the airstream can vary. Dust can leak from behind the TBM face shield, from gaps in the ventilation duct, or from a mal-functioning <b>dust</b> <b>collector.</b> It can be entrained into the air from the muck on a moving conveyor belt. It can even be shaken loose from the underside of the belt as it passes over the idlers.
