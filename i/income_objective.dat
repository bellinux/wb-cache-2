40|$|A country's {{level of}} <b>objective</b> <b>income</b> {{inequality}} and a person's income are predictors of individual level redistributive preferences. These theoretical assertions arise from formal models that ignore the subjective dimensions of income inequality. A country's level of <b>objective</b> <b>income</b> inequality, usually measured in Gini ratios, affects the life chances of individuals {{but not a}} person's normative values about income inequality. Such subjective dimensions of income inequality are important because they affect substantive outcomes. This dissertation examines the determinants of one subjective dimension of income inequality, individual tolerance for income inequality, {{and its effect on}} a person's redistributive preferences. This dissertation contributes to the income inequality literature by conceptualizing and testing the determinants of individual tolerance for income inequality. Using a cross-nation dataset of 87 countries, I show that an individual's subjective social status affects his level of tolerance for income inequality and I present a counterintuitive finding: a country's level of wealth and <b>objective</b> <b>income</b> inequality do not systematically affect an individual's level of tolerance for income inequality. Substantively, a person who lives in a poor country with high <b>objective</b> <b>income</b> inequality (e. g., Nigeria) and another person who lives in a rich country with low <b>objective</b> <b>income</b> inequality (e. g., Switzerland) are equally likely to feel that their respective country's level of income inequality is not too high. Redistribution is a government's way of reducing inequality but {{people who live in the}} same country have different levels of preferences for redistribution. This dissertation's second contribution is to the redistribution literature. I argue that a person's level of tolerance for income inequality and other socio-economic characteristics (e. g., income) affect his preferences for redistribution. Specifically, a person who feels that his country's level of <b>objective</b> <b>income</b> inequality is too high is more likely to support government redistribution. Contrary to extant studies, this dissertation finds that a country's level of wealth and <b>objective</b> <b>income</b> inequality do not systematically affect its citizens' preference for redistribution. I argue that the crux of the theoretical and empirical connections between redistribution and inequality are the multiple income inequalities that citizens perceive and a country's level <b>objective</b> <b>income</b> inequality, by itself, does not systematically affect a person's degree of preference for redistribution...|$|R

In {{order to determine}} the characteristics of this type of production system, a cross-sectional questionnaire survey on farm characteristics and management was collected from 182 farmers in Busia District. The mean farm size was one acre, while the mean number of pigs per farm was 3. 6. Pigs were mainly kept as a source of income (98 %) and majority were of cross breed variety (64 %). The production systems included farrow to weaner (12 %), porker to finisher (36 %), and mixed (46 %). Sixty five percent (65 %) of the pigs were tethered and housing was not provided in 61 % of the farms. Most of the feeds were sourced locally. Lack of castration and delayed weaning of pigs was observed on 49 % and 30 % of the farms, respectively. The main production constraints included pig diseases (81 %) and high cost or lack of feed (81 %). Haematopinus suis infestations and worm infections were considered {{to be the most important}} diseases by 71 % and 55 % of the farmers, respectively. Farmers had moderate knowledge on parasitic disease diagnosis with 31 % and 62 % not having a history of either deworming or spraying pigs with acaricides, respectively.

40|$|Background : Recent trends show an {{unprecedented}} feminisation of migration in China, {{triggered by the}} increasing demand for cheap labour in big cities {{and the availability of}} women in the labour market. These trends corroborate the evidence that non-agricultural work and remittance from urban labour migrants have become the major sources of rural household <b>income.</b> <b>Objective</b> : This paper investigates the extent of gender inequalities in job participation and wage earning among internal labour migrants in China. We hypothesize that female migrants in cities are economically more disadvantaged than male migrants in the job market. Methods : We use data from the 2010 National Migrant Dynamics Monitoring Survey conducted in 106 cities representing all 31 provinces and geographic regions. The study applies the standard Heckman two-step Probit-OLS method to model job participation and wage-earning, separately for 59, 225 males and 41, 546 females aged 16 - 59 years, adjusting for demographic and social characteristics and potential selection effects. Results : Female migrants have much lower job-participation and wage-earning potential than male migrants. Male migrants earn 26 Š higher hourly wages than their female counterparts. Decomposition analysis confirms potential gender discrimination, suggesting that 88 Š of the gender difference in wages (or 12 Š of female migrant wage) is due to discriminatory treatment of female migrants in the Chinese job market. Migrants with rural hukou status have a smaller chance of participation in the job market and they earn lower wages than those with urban hukou, regardless of education advantage. Conclusions : There is evidence of significant female disadvantage among internal labour migrants in the job market in Chinese cities. Household registration by urban and rural areas, as controlled by the hukou status, partly explains the differing job participation and wage earning among female labour migrants in urban China. Comments : Female migrants have higher opportunity costs and family constraints to participate in job market than male migrants. Higher job participation among male migrants suggests that men face stiff competition for jobs in cities {{and are more likely to}} accept jobs with a lower wage offer...|$|E
40|$|U. S. {{agriculture}} {{in the twentieth century}} evidenced dramatic change. With the {{reduction in the number of}} occupational farmers, the future of these farm operations and the decisions that shape the sector are of paramount importance. The objectives and choices made by farmers, particularly their approaches to business succession, will have significant impacts on the farm community and the future structure of U. S. agriculture. ^ The first paper of this thesis identifies factors that influence primacy between generations in the management structure of U. S. family farms. The paper fills an important gap in the farm succession literature by exploring succession (in management of the farm) as an incremental process. Estimation with cross-sectional data from the USDA-ERS’ Agricultural Resource Management Survey (ARMS) and a limited dependent variable model explains the decision for younger generation operators to assume primary farm management duties while a senior operator moves to a secondary role. Our findings include a number of statistically significant attributes that explain variation in the younger farmer’s managerial role (primary versus secondary). These results suggest that transferring primary operator status is more strongly influenced by family members’ characteristics such as age and education than any particular set of farm financial or operating characteristics. ^ The second paper of this thesis focuses on the lifecycle <b>income</b> <b>objective</b> of business-owning (farm and nonfarm) households. Specifically, we test for differences in saving behavior of these entrepreneurial households relative to the average U. S. household. We hypothesize that the complex relationship between household and business management decisions has the potential to counter predictions from standard household savings theory, a notion that previous studies in the literature have failed to take into account. With an increasing number of small business-owning families, this has the potential for analyses to misrepresent household savings rates. Here again we use a limited dependent variable model, keying in on the saving behavior and ability of household respondents in the Survey of Consumer Finances (SCF) for 2007. Econometric investigation is used to describe which attributes influence the probability of a household attaining a positive saving level in the past year. The estimation results indicate that, along with standard demographic influences of savings models, households owning a farm or nonfarm business have a significantly higher likelihood of maintaining private saving in a given year. Our results highlight the necessity for future research on household saving behavior to account for the differing objectives and choice sets faced by households that own businesses when conducting analysis of household saving. ...|$|E

40|$|In their chapter, ‘Pillar II: a real {{improvement}} of the CAP?’, Koester and Senior Nello note {{that the creation of}} the second pillar of the CAP (rural development policy) in 2000 appeared a rational choice and an {{improvement of}} theCAP, but in fact it involved the introduction {{of a wide range of}} measures, some of which were not very efficient or targeted. While the first pillar of the CAP covers market measures such as the single farm payment, at least in theory, measures under the second pillar should support agriculture	as	a	provider	of	public	goods. 	Rural development policy is centred on three central thematic axes: raising the competitiveness of the agricultural and forestry sectors; improving the environment and the countryside; and increasing the quality of life in rural areas and encouraging diversification of the rural economy. In terms of expenditure from the EU budget the second pillar is not	yet	as important as the first pillar, though the aim is to achieve a better balance 27 between the two pillars. Koester and Senior Nello concentrate on two aspects of the second pillar of the CAP: investment support and agri-environmental measures, also taking into consideration the question of ‘governance’. They maintain that present and future waste under the second pillar could exceed that of the first pillar. With regard to EU investment support, they conclude that measures are not	effective as they result in an increase in agricultural investment, but by much less than suggested by the level of support. In addition, overall investment in the economy declines as the tax burden for non- agricultural sectors increases. They maintain that the investment support is likely to lead to an increase in financial but not necessarily economic efficiency. The latter would require correction of market failure, and EU investment support is not focused on the	main market failures in rural areas: those in the labour market and the inadequate supply of public goods. There may also be problems of governance as a result	of distortions in incentives and failure to respect the principle of subsidiarity. In short, weaknesses in implementation and lack of genuine control cast doubts about whether farm investment support should be left as a responsibility of the EU. Turning to agri-environmental measures, the authors maintain that these are not efficient, as financial outlays are not based on an inventory of agri-environmental requirements, but mainly on the farm <b>income</b> <b>objective</b> and past expenditure on agriculture. Moreover agri- environmental measures encounter problems of governance on a number of counts. The principle of subsidiarity is not observed since most problems are located in regions or countries. Frequently	the impact of policies cannot be measured (a problem indicated also by the European Court of Auditors), and this difficulty is exacerbated by the fact that at times the effects of different measures overlap. Also in this case the authors conclude that implementation problems and the absence of adequate monitoring and controls could lead to substantial waste of EU money...|$|E
40|$|Although {{securing}} {{adequate and}} stable income levels for farm households still figures prominently among agricultural policy objectives in many OECD countries, {{there is usually}} no precise definition of income targets and information to evaluate achievements is often inadequate.

Three dimensions of adequacy are defined: income, poverty, and differentiation of pensioners’ material situation by gender. Next, sub-indicators measuring the individual dimensions of adequacy are proposed, along with an aggregation procedure based on the tools of multidimensional statistical analysis. First the sub-indicators are aggregated into synthetic indicators for individual dimensions, and finally the synthetic indicators for individual dimensions are aggregated into a single synthetic indicator of {{the adequacy of the}} pension system (APS). Based on the proposed procedure, the adequacy of the pensions systems of 26 European countries is measured, and the quality of this measurement is assessed. Filip Chybalsk...|$|R
