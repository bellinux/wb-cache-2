40|$|It is {{well known}} that a liquid drop {{released}} over a very hot surface generally does not contact the surface nor boils but rather levitates over a thin vapor film generated by its own evaporation (Leidenfrost effect). In particular, the case of a hot (and flat) solid substrate has been extensively studied in recent years. In contrast, we here focus on Leidenfrost drops over a superheated liquid bath, addressing the problem theoretically and comparing our predictions with experimental results, detailed in a separate talk. We predict the geometry of the drop and of the liquid bath, based on the <b>hydrostatic</b> Young-Laplace and <b>lubrication</b> equations. A good agreement is observed with the available experimental data concerning the deformation of the liquid bath. The modeling also yields a rather complete insight into the shape of the drop. As {{in the case of a}} solid substrate, the vapor layer generally appears to be composed of a vapor pocket surrounded by a circular neck. The influences of the superheat and of the drop size are parametrically investigated. A number of scaling laws are established. Unlike the case of a solid substrate, no chimney instability was found in the range of drop size studied. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
40|$|By definition, {{differential}} roughness occurs {{where the}} surface roughness of one region is distinctly {{different from that}} of an adjacent region. Differential roughness may occur on a sliding surface when the structure of an area of the surface is modified relative to the original material. Differential roughness may be used to effect a film thickness change so as to cause hydrodynamic or <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> effects just as if the surfaces were machined. The advantage of differential roughness is that the effective offset of film thickness continues to exist even if there is gross wear. One can effect film thickness changes which are smaller than can be made directly. Furthermore, asperity tip load support is the same over both the high roughness and small roughness regions. The potential uses for differential roughness are seals, bearings, and pumps. Some examples are presented...|$|E
40|$|Tilting-pad {{hydrodynamic}} {{thrust bearings}} {{are used in}} hydroelectric power stations around the world, reliably supporting turbines weighing hundreds of tonnes, over decades of service. Newer designs incorporate hydrostatic recesses machined into the sector-shaped pads to enhance oil film thickness at low rotational speeds. External pressurisation practically eliminates wear and enhances service life and reliability. It follows that older generating plants, lacking such assistance, stand to benefit from being retrofitted with <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> systems. The design process is not trivial however. The need to increase the groove size to permit spontaneous lifting of the turbine under hydrostatic pressure, conflicts {{with the need to}} preserve performance of the original plane pad design. A haphazardly designed recess can induce a significant rise in bearing temperature concomitant with reduced mechanical efficiency and risk of thermal damage. In this work, a numerical study of a sector-shaped pad is undertaken to demonstrate how recess size and shape can affect the performance of a typical bearing...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: From the {{engineering}} point of view, the mechanical face seal has two main constituent parts: {{one of them}} is fixed by the shaft and it’s rotating at the same time with it and the second one is the stator, which is fixed in the carcass. The two parts together form the primary mechanical seal. They can be rigidly tied by their support, {{but most of the time}} they allow one of more liberty degrees. These ties represent one or more secondary mechanical seals and also elastic elements. The optimization of a mechanical face seal means the satisfaction of two antagonistic conditions. One is trying to reduce to the minimum the leakages, even to make them vanish and also trying to limit the friction and the wear. The second one presumes that a lubrication normal operation of the HS, HD, THD, EHD and/or M surfaces is ensured. This paper takes into consideration just the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> from the primary mechanical seal, along with the purpose to place at projectors disposal different relations for the functional parameters (the opening axial force, the loss debit) ...|$|E

40|$|In rocket engines {{power is}} usually {{obtained}} by burning fuel and oxidizer which are mixed, pressurized, and directed to a combustion chamber {{by means of}} turbopumps. Roller bearings are generally used in these turbopumps, but because of bearing demands hydrostatic bearings were proposed. The use of such bearings is quite feasible because during flight <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> can reduce roller bearing wear. A disadvantage of such proposals is that during startup, acceleration, and shutdown high pressure fluids are not available for hydrostatic bearings. The fluid lubrication film is not always present in bearings of turbopumps. During these periods a second bearing is required to carry the load. This requirement suggests the use of hybrid bearings in rocket engine turbopumps. Such duplex bearings were provided, but when their inner races are keyed to the shaft or journal {{two of them are}} required. And such duplex bearings do not wear evenly.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{feasibility}} {{study of a}} special kind of toroidal CVT is presented based on different standpoints. The mechanism is briefly described and its kinematic structure is analysed. Its corresponding graph, which turns out to be not planar, is detected by means of a new method for classifying the nonholonomic pairs. The degrees of freedom are so evaluated and the independent circuits are identified. The kinematic analysis leads to a symbolic expression of the global transmission ratio and a simple relation between the two control angles is found to be necessary to theoretically avoid sliding at the contact points. The static force analysis is also carried out in order to ascertain the best method for applying the static pre-load needed to operate the transmission by friction in automotive applications. Finally, the two spherical pairs, which are embodied in the system, are made subject to a feasibility check by analysing the hydrodynamic lubrication conditions and by obtaining through a numerical approach, the oil film thickness and the pressure field over all the spherical domain.

40|$|Fluid film {{forces are}} {{generated}} in multirecess journal bearings by {{two types of}} lubrication mechanism: the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> in the bearing recesses and hydrodynamic lubrication in the bearing lands, when operating in rotation. The combination of both lubrication mechanism leads to hybrid journal bearings (HJB). When part of hydrostatic pressure is also dynamically modified by means of hydraulic control systems, one refers to the active lubrication, resulting in the active hybrid journal bearing (AHJB). The AHJB is mathematically modeled based on the Reynolds ’ equations in land regions {{and a set of}} modified continuity equations for the lubricant flow in the bearing recesses, coupled to equations describing pressure and flow in the servovalves. The solution of such a set o equations allows the determination of fluid film stiffness and damping coefficients of the hybrid and/or active lubricated bearing. Such coefficients are a function of design and operational parameters, characterized by the Sommerfeld number as well by the gains of the feedback control system. The main contribution of the present theoretical work is to analyze the stability characteristics of a flexible rotor-bearing system by using passively and actively lubricated hybrid journal bearing. The dynamic of a flexible rotor is modeled by using finite element method and, after coupling the bearing dynamic coefficients to the rotor model, the feedback control law is defined and a suitable set of control gains is calculated for the active lubrication, leading to a rotor with a wider and more safety operational frequency range...|$|E
30|$|In {{the drawing}} process, the sheet metal and punch are {{in close contact}} with each other when {{entering}} the die cavity. During this process, the sheet metal slides through the blank holder and lower die surface. Therefore, friction must be increased between the sheet metal and punch or decreased between the metal sheet and blank-holder or lower die to improve formability (Gong et al. 2011). Gong et al. (2011) used a diamond-like carbon coated blank holder and lower die in a cylindrical cup microforming experiment to reduce friction between the metal sheet and lower die and the blank holder, thereby enhancing formability. Additionally, the micro-features can be used to change the physical properties of the contact surface of the material (Segu and Kim 2014). Steinhoff et al. (1996) investigated the use of deterministic and stochastic surface structures in strip drawing processes. The experimental result shows that the <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> pockets results in a considerable improvement of the tribological behaviour. Costa and Hutchings (2009) studied the friction effects of controlled surface patterning in tribological situations by using the strip drawing test. The result shows that the relative orientation between the pattern and the drawing direction strongly influenced the friction performance. Moreover, Lin et al. (2015) adopted a microridge punch design that increased not only the friction between the sheet metal and the punch but also the pulling force of the microridges on the sheet metal, distributing the pulling force of the punch on the sheet metal to the microridges. This dispersed the pulling force at the nasal fillet of the punch on the sheet metal and substantially increased drawability.|$|E
40|$|The Department of Production and Industrial Administration of The College of Aeronautics {{has made}} a {{detailed}} analysis into the performance of numerically controlled machine tools, and this shows that when these machines are operating under light cutting loads, the total envelope tolerance is about 0. 003 ins. Further investigation into {{the source of the}} errors showed that about 80 per cent of this error was due to mechanical mechanisms in the machine tool. The electronic equipment operated inside a total band of 0. 0004 ins. over small distances, and 0. 0006 ins. over 10 inches. This situation appeared to justify a comprehensive survey into the methods which may be used to improve the mechanical performance of these machines. After due consideration had been given to a number of possible alternatives, it was decided to fit <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> to the slides, nut and screw arrangement, and the thrust bearings used on the X and Y axes of an existing No. 3 Archdale Milling Machine. The Z axis {{was not included in the}} redesign, because analysis showed that a new head casting would have been necessary.

40|$|Figures {{presented}} periodically by {{classification societies}} show, {{a major cause}} of ship casualty to be stem bearing failure. This is particularly the case for large fall bodied bulk carriers and tankers. Non-uniform wake distribution around the stem of vessels causes uneven and constantly varying loads upon the bearing. These loads are examined and it is concluded that they may cause lubricant film breakdown and seal failures. Examination of stem bearing failures generally confirms this view and several bearing case histories are presented Present designs of stem bearings are appraised with the conclusion that all recent advances in stem bearing design have been for the purpose of improving maintainability rather than reliability. Examination of the loading pattern and the basic design requirements of stem gear indicate that the provision of jacking oil would considerably improve stem gear reliability. This is particularly aimed at reducing the frequency of failure caused by turning gear operation. Experimental work in which oil film thickness measurements were taken on the aftermost bearing of a container ship is presented. This clearly demonstrates the problem of turning gear damage. Furthermore the shaft movements recorded at this plummer bearing show that considerable tallshaft lift (the full stem bearing clearance is taken up) occurs and that the tailskaft probably executes a closed loop under the action of the propeller. Design curves are given to show the lubricating oil pressures and quantities required. It is further postulated that, within the framework of existing classification society rules full <b>hydrostatic</b> <b>lubrication</b> would have even greater advantages. Design curves to a basis of shaft diameter are presented to enable clearance, pressure, lubricant flow, stiffness and basic dimensions to be derived by simple calculation. Experimental data on suitable materials are given and an overall material specification produced. Designs are given for three typical ship types and based upon these, cost comparisons made. Costs are such that an economic as well as technical case can be advanced for the use of hydrostatic stern bearings...|$|E
40|$|Steel sheet is the {{prevalent}} material for car body panels. In the manufacturing of steel sheets a certain surface roughness is achieved {{from the ground}} or textured rolls used in the three final reduction steps. When manufacturing car body panels the sheets first are formed and then painted. For these two processes, the roughness obtained from the reduction rolls will influence both friction and paint results. Furthermore, the processes have environmental effects through the choice of lubricant, amount of lubricant, paint, and amount of paint. From knowledge of pollution and cost, {{it is easy to}} understand that it is of great interest to decrease the amounts of both lubricant and paint. Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} how the surface topography influences frictional behaviour and paint results. The work presented in this thesis is focused on finding and describing features in the sheet surface topography that influence friction. In order to investigate frictional behaviour and the change in surface roughness of different sheet topographies during forming, a test method that simulates the die radius in the forming tool was used. The method is called Bending-Under-Tension, BUT. In the test, steel strips were bent and drawn over a cylindrical tool, under prescribed pressure, sliding velocity, and lubrication. Thereafter, the surface topography was measured in the contacthe tool was in contact when the test was stopped. By ball-filtering the surface roughness measurements, thereby simulating realistic contact conditions, and then estimating the area fraction of contact, a so-called WihlborgCrafoord index (WC index) can be calculated. This WC index indicates whether the surface has a good lubricant supply or not. It is well correlated to the friction coefficient achieved from BUT friction tests in mixed lubrication. The WC index is designed with respect to both the Micro Plasto HydroDynamic Lubrication (MPHDL) and Micro Plasto <b>HydroStatic</b> <b>Lubrication</b> (MPHSL) mechanisms. From this WC index and previous work on prediction of paint appearance, it can be stated that in regard to the surface topography, there is no conflict between the requirements for good paint results and low friction. The paint results depend on amplitudes of waviness between 0. 83 mm, while the frictional behaviour is dependent on features in an interval of much shorter wavelengths. For low friction, the surface should have many contact areas with many small pockets on them, and the ratio of the perimeter to the area of the pockets should be maximised. The peaks of these contact areas should be located at the same height, and the angle to the edge of a lubricant pocket should be small...|$|E
