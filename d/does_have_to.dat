25|$|Many of our {{important}} source documents, {{such as the}} Assyrian King List, are the products of government and religious establishments. They often have a built-in slant {{in favor of the}} king or god in charge. A king may even take credit for a battle or construction project of an earlier ruler. The Assyrians in particular have a literary tradition of always putting the best possible face on history. The tablets or inscriptions in question still have value, though one <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> keep the slant in mind.|$|E
25|$|Although {{advice from}} the Prime Minister to the Queen is binding, she <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> officially accept or assent in order for it to go into effect. The Governor-General's office source said that no {{decision}} from Elizabeth II had been made yet as to whether Itelali's removal by Telavi would be accepted, and thus, {{at the time of}} dismissing Telavi, Itelali remained the incumbent Governor-General of Tuvalu. It is suspected the Queen deliberately chose to take time before officially accepting the advice in order to allow Itelali to remove Telavi. Once Telavi was removed his pending advice to the Queen becomes moot, and Itelali remained Governor-General.|$|E

25|$|Because R. romandi nests {{can often}} be found on buildings, {{it is common for}} wasp nests to be built in heavily human {{populated}} areas. Their nests do not cause any structural damage, so if the nests are located in out of the way areas, they are best left alone. Attempting to knock them down will induce the aggressive behavior described above, and R. romandi tend to rebuild nests in similar spots. Additionally, paper wasps feed their young on caterpillars, so they can help eliminate common garden and agricultural pests. If one <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> get rid of a nest, it is recommended that the job is done by a professional exterminator, or with a fast acting can of insecticide. The best time to get rid of an R. romandi nest is at dawn or after dark when the wasps are most docile.|$|E

Brian Lowry of Variety believed [...] "One <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> question the logic behind adding nipples to the hard-rubber batsuit. Whose idea was that supposed to be anyway, Alfred's?

She <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> deal with the psychological effects of her husband coming off tour and readjusting to domestic life. After the extended 1992–1993 Zoo TV Tour, full of sensory overloads and alternate stage personae for Bono, the couple began a practice of hosting Sunday lunches at home, to establish a sense of regular, ordinary activities. The family became fixtures at Sunday services in Killiney as well, with a bond of Christianity still existing between the couple.

2500|$|Unlike {{most other}} states, New Hampshire permits voters {{who have not}} {{declared}} their party affiliation to vote in a party's primary. A voter <b>does</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> officially join a specific political party before voting; however, the voter can change his or her affiliation back to [...] "Undeclared" [...] immediately after voting, and hence he or she only has {{to belong to a}} party for the few minutes it takes to fill out and cast a ballot. Voters who are already registered members of a political party cannot change their affiliation at the polling place; that can only be done before the checklist is closed several weeks prior to the election. New voters can, however, register at the polling place. All voting is done with paper ballots; however, most of the paper ballots are counted by machine.|$|E
