We report the most complete demonstration to <b>date</b> <b>of</b> the <b>applicability</b> <b>of</b> the PS foraging game in a free-living animal, the Carib grackle (Quiscalus lugubris) of Barbados. As assumed by PS games, the payoffs obtained by scroungers were negatively frequency dependent.

Observations of marked birds revealed that group-level changes could be brought about by individual flexibility in tactic use. Despite consistent individual differences in tactic use, most birds used both tactics and could alter their use of producing and scrounging when conditions changed. We found no difference in the payoffs obtained by producers and scroungers, suggesting a symmetrical game equilibrium. Our results call for testing the PS foraging game in a broader range of biological systems that include different types of scrounging behavior (e. g., scramble, stealthful, or aggressive scrounging) as well as the exploitation of different phases of food production (e. g., searching, handling).

The <b>applicability</b> <b>of</b> this elemental pair {{needs to be}} established for stellar spectroscopy. Aims. We aim at a spectroscopic determination of the abundance of Hf and Th in the solar photosphere based on a CO 5 BOLD 3 D hydrodynamical model atmosphere. We put this into a wider context by investigating 3 D abundance corrections {{for a set of}} G- and F-type dwarfs. Methods. High-resolution, high signal-to-noise solar spectra were compared to line synthesis calculations performed on a solar CO 5 BOLD model. For the other atmospheres, we compared synthetic spectra of CO 5 BOLD 3 D and associated 1 D models. Results. For Hf we find a photospheric abundance A(Hf) = 0. 87 ± 0. 04, in good agreement with a previous analysis, based on 1 D model atmospheres. The weak Thii 401. 9 nm line constitutes the only Th abundance indicator available in the solar spectrum. It lies in the red wing of an Ni-Fe blend exhibiting a non-negligible convective asymmetry. Accounting for the asymmetry-related additional absorption, we obtain A(Th) = 0. 09 ± 0. 03, consistent with the meteoritic abundance, and about 0. 1 dex lower than obtained in previous photospheric abundance determinations. Conclusions. Only for the second time, to our knowledge, has a non-negligible effect of convective line asymmetries on an abundance derivation been highlighted.

Prediscovery and postdiscovery photometry of SN 2014 J is measured from images taken by two different telescopes of the network, and {{is compared to}} measurements from the Katzman Automatic Imaging Telescope and the Itagaki Observatory. In the early light-curve phase (which exhibits stable spectral behavior with constant color indices), these data agree with reasonably high accuracy (better than 0. 05 mag around maximum brightness, and 0. 15 mag at earlier times). Owing to the changing spectral energy distribution of the SN and the different spectral characteristics of the systems used, differences increase after maximum light. We augment light curves of SN 2014 J downloaded from the American Association of Variable Star Observers (AAVSO) online database with these data, and consider the complete brightness evolution of this important Type Ia SN.

The joint representation {{of space and time}} associated to an event as understood by the brain is shown to be different from that understood in modern physics. This indicates that the four-dimensional geometry i. e. Minkowski geometry is not an appropriate description for the internal world.
