5000|$|In Industrial Knitting applications, {{the terms}} [...] "Flat" [...] and [...] "Circular" [...] have very {{different}} meanings to those given above. A [...] "Flat" [...] or Vee Bed knitting machine consists of 2 flat needle beds arranged in an upside-down [...] "V" [...] formation. These needle beds can be up to 2.5 metres wide. A carriage, {{also known as a}} Cambox or Head, moves backwards and forwards across these needle beds, working the needles to selectively, knit, tuck or transfer stitches. A <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> machine is very flexible, allowing complex stitch designs, shaped knitting and precise width adjustment. It is, however relatively slow when compared to a circular machine. Knitting speed up to [...]5 m/s or low is considered the low speed in <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> which is generally in hand flat machines. The two largest manufacturers of industrial <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> machines are Stoll of Germany, and Shima Seiki of Japan. The industrial hand <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> machine is considered to be launched by the Isaac Lamb patents.|$|E

Establish the texture variation model based on the changing process from the normal yarn to loop that provides the realistic texture of the simulative loop. Then optimize the simulative loop based on illumination variation. This paper develops the computer program with the optimization algorithm and achieves the loop simulation of different yarns to verify the feasibility of the proposed algorithm. Our work provides a fast CAD of the <b>flat</b> <b>knitted</b> fabric with loop simulation, and it is not only more realistic but also material adjustable.

50|$|In <b>flat</b> <b>knitting,</b> {{generally}} stockinette stitch, the hand-knitter knits from right-to-left on {{one side}} of the fabric, turns the work (over), and then purls right-to-left back to the starting position. Usually the smooth side of the fabric is considered the right side, the one facing outwards for viewing; and the side that faces inwards, towards the body, the ridged side, is known as the wrong side. Thus, <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> involves knitting each row on the right side, then purling each row on the wrong side, etc. If each row is knit (no purls) this creates garter stitch, which has the same appearance on both sides and creates horizontal ridges offset by valleys, rather than a knit and purl side. Patterned stitching, such as cables, can be accomplished with either <b>flat</b> <b>knitting,</b> or in the round, however the technique must follow the desired pattern.|$|E

50|$|A {{substantial}} {{hand knitting}} industry {{is believed to}} have developed in Scotland by the late 15th century: bonnetmakers produced broad, <b>flat</b> <b>knitted</b> caps in imitation of the velvet caps popular amongst the upper classes of the time. Dyed with blue or grey vegetable dyes, they became popular with the peasantry {{and by the end of}} the 16th century - as noted by Fynes Moryson - the bonnet had been adopted nearly universally by men throughout the Lowlands, although it did not become widely worn in the Highlands until the following century. Martin Martin, writing around 1700, describes Highlanders as mainly wearing thick woollen bonnets of blue or grey. It was the bonnet's blue colour, as well as, perhaps, its Lowland and peasant origins, that influenced its adoption as a badge of the Covenanters, who used blue to distinguish themselves from their Royalist opponents and their red cockades and ribbons.|$|R

50|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>knitting</b> {{is usually}} contrasted with {{circular}} knitting, {{in which the}} fabric is always knitted from the same side. <b>Flat</b> <b>knitting</b> can complicate knitting somewhat compared to circular knitting, since the same stitch (as seen from the right side) is produced by two different movements when knitted from the right and wrong sides. Thus, a knit stitch (as seen from the right side) may be produced by a knit stitch on the right side, or by a purl stitch on the wrong side. This may cause the gauge of the knitting to vary in alternating rows of stockinette fabrics; however, this effect is usually not noticeable, and may be eliminated with practice (the usual way) or by using needles of two different sizes (an unusual and less effective way).|$|E
5000|$|Modern stockings, pantyhose, and thigh highs {{are made}} by either <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> {{or the use of}} {{circular}} machines. <b>Flat</b> <b>knitting</b> is the original hosiery manufacturing technique of the 1930s-1950s. After the fabric has been produced, each thigh high is individually seamed. The top of the seam has a [...] "finishing loop", a small hole that every seamed thigh high has {{as a result of the}} machinist turning the welt—the thigh high top—inside out, in order to finish off. Once sewn, the thigh highs are [...] "boarded". This is a process where each thigh high is stretched over a flat metal leg form and [...] "set" [...] with steam. The knit tightens, creases are eliminated and the leg is correctly shaped. Because the process is time consuming, seamed thigh highs are never cheap. Also, around a third of production—especially during the production of sheer stockings—is discarded during quality control.|$|E
5000|$|Hand {{knitting}} {{can either}} be done [...] "flat" [...] or [...] "in the round". <b>Flat</b> <b>knitting</b> is done {{on a set of}} single point knitting needles, and the knitter goes back and forth, adding rows. In Circular knitting, or [...] "knitting in the round", the knitter knits around a circle, creating a tube. This can be done with a set of four double pointed needles or a single circular needle.|$|E
40|$|An attempt {{has been}} made to improve the {{mechanical}} properties of the composites with knitted performs by introducing horizontal strands in the course direction in a flat-bed <b>knitting</b> machine. <b>Flat</b> <b>knitted</b> performs were produced with different proportions of axial inlay strands and the composite laminates were prepared using the vacuum-assisted resin transfer moulding technique. It is observed that the introduction of inlay strands influences the structure of the knitted preform by increasing course density, wale density and thickness. This result in the increased anisotropic behaviour of the composite laminate showing increased strength in the course direction and decreased strength in the wale direction. The flexural strength of the knitted preform composites increases in both wale and course directions with the introduction of inlay strands. Laminates from preforms with two inlays exhibit overall improved impact properties whereas those from preforms with one inlay show higher impact damage tolerance index. These observations are explained in terms of the change in fibre architecture brought about by the introduction of the inlay strands...|$|R

5000|$|Full Fashioned: Fully {{fashioned}} stockings are <b>knitted</b> <b>flat,</b> {{the material}} is then cut and {{the two sides are}} then united by a seam up the back. Fully fashioned stockings were the most popular style until the 1960s.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} methods for double knitting, {{including}} <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> on double-pointed knitting needles; after one row has been worked with one yarn, the knitter slides the stitches {{to the other}} end of the needle and begins the same row with the next yarn. Only half the stitches are knitted with any one yarn; the rest are slipped. After both passes are done, the knitter then turns the work and begins another row.|$|E
50|$|Seamless knitted gloves are knitted in {{one piece}} by a <b>flat</b> <b>knitting</b> machine. The cut {{protection}} is provided by high performance materials such as Para aramid (Twaron, Kevlar), HPPE (High Performance Poly Ethylene, Dyneema, Spectra), special PVA yarns (SupraBlock) or steelfibre and fibreglass yarns. Thick gloves are usually knitted on a 10gauge machine while thinner and more flexible styles are knitted on a 13gauge machine. The gloves are usually coated with solid or foamed Latex, Nitrile or Polyurethane.|$|E
50|$|After winding a {{few yards}} of each colour onto its own bobbin (and {{possibly}} several bobbins' worth of some colours), the knitter simply begins knitting their pattern. When they arrive {{at a point where}} the colour changes, the knitter brings the new colour up underneath the old one (to prevent holes) and starts knitting with it. If <b>flat</b> <b>knitting,</b> {{at the end of the}} row, the piece is turned round just as with regular knitting, and the knitter returns the way they came.|$|E
2500|$|The first US {{patent for}} a {{circular}} needle was issued in 1918, although in Europe {{they may have}} been used a little earlier. [...] Circulars are composed of two pointed, straight tips connected by a flexible cable and may be used for both <b>knitting</b> <b>flat</b> or <b>knitting</b> in the round. [...] The two tapered ends, typically 4–5 inches (10.5–13cm) long, are rigid, allowing for easy knitting, and are connected by the flexible strand (usually made of nylon or coated wire). [...] The tips may be permanently connected to the cable and made in overall lengths from [...] to [...] or composed of cables and interchangeable tips. This allows various lengths and diameters to be combined into many different sizes of needles, allowing for a great variety of needs to be met by a relatively few component pieces. [...] The ability to work from either end of one needle is convenient in several types of knitting, such as slip-stitch versions of double knitting.|$|R
50|$|Hand {{spinning}} {{can be done}} {{by using}} a spindle or the spinning wheel. Spinning turns the carded wool fibres into yarn which can then be directly woven, <b>knitted</b> (<b>flat</b> or circular), crocheted, or by other means turned into fabric or a garment.|$|R
50|$|Short rows {{may be used}} to bend a <b>flat</b> {{ribbon of}} <b>knitting,</b> which {{requires}} more fabric {{on the outside of the}} curve than on the inside of the curve. Short rows introduced on the outside edge will cause the ribbon to bend.|$|R
50|$|Circular {{knitting}} or knitting in {{the round}} {{is a form of}} knitting that creates a seamless tube. When knitting circularly, the knitting is cast on and the circle of stitches is joined. Knitting is worked in rounds (the equivalent of rows in <b>flat</b> <b>knitting)</b> in a spiral. Originally, circular knitting was done using a set of four or five double-pointed needles. Later, circular needles were invented, which {{can also be used to}} knit {{in the round}}: the circular needle looks like two short knitting needles connected by a cable between them.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Flat</b> <b>knitting</b> is {{a method}} for {{producing}} knitted fabrics in which the work is turned periodically, i.e., the fabric is worked with alternating sides facing the knitter. Another method of reaching the same result is to knit alternately {{from right to left}} and left to right without turning; this back-and-forth technique requires either innate or learned ambidextrous motor skills. The two sides (or [...] "faces") of the fabric are usually designated as the right side (the side that faces outwards, towards the viewer and away from the wearer's body) and the wrong side (the side that faces inwards, away from the viewer and towards the wearer's body).|$|E
5000|$|Combined {{knitting}} or combination knitting is a {{style that}} combines elements of Eastern-style knitting with the Western techniques. The name was suggested by Mary Thomas in her 1938 book [...] "Mary Thomas's Knitting Book", where she described the technique as [...] "..the better way to work in <b>Flat</b> <b>Knitting.</b> The resulting fabric is more even and closer in construction." [...] By wrapping the yarn the opposite way while purling, the knitter changes {{the orientation of the}} resulting loops; then the next row's knit stitches can be formed by inserting the needle through the back leg (as in Eastern knitting), rather than through the front leg, without twisting the stitch. This technique is suitable for all knitted fabrics from the basic Stockinette stitch, to any other style, such as Fair Isle, circular knitting, or lace knitting.|$|E
40|$|Wearable sensors {{have the}} {{potential}} to provide new methods of non-invasive physiological measurement in real-time. This work presents an alternative to the current clinical measurement of spinal flexion; the modified Schober’s test. The accuracy of the test is determined by each clinician, which causes a large tendency towards error [1]. By implementing a strain sensor {{as an alternative to the}} measuring tape currently used, it is proposed that inter-observer error would be reduced and more consistent measurements would be provided over time. Herein, two types of textile based sensors were tested for use in this application; a knitted spandex cylindrical structure with integrated carbon nanotubes (CNT) and a <b>flat,</b> <b>knitted</b> piezoresistive fabric (KPF) knitted with Lycra® [2]. Of each type, numerous samples were fabricated with varying length, width, core size, tension and knit direction. Each sensor was tested for resistance changes versus strain in the laboratory where it was clear that KPF sensors knit under high tension provided accurate and reproducible electrical properties. All varieties of CNT sensors showed inconsistent resistance measurements over time, rendering them unsuitable for use of such precise measurements. After calibration, it is proposed that these sensors can be easily integrated into a wearable device to be used in a clinical setting. ...|$|R

In advanced stages, reduction of adipose tissue is the only available effective treatment. In elderly patients with advanced lipedema, correction of increased skin laxity has {{to be considered for}} an optimal outcome. Methods: We report on a tailored combined approach to improve advanced lipedema in elderly females with multiple comorbidities. Microcannular laser-assisted liposuction of the upper legs and knees is performed under tumescent anesthesia. Medial thigh lift and partial lower abdominoplasty with minimal undermining are used to correct skin laxity and prevent intertrigo. Postsurgical care with nonelastic <b>flat</b> <b>knitted</b> compression garments and manual lymph drainage are used. Results: We report on three women aged 55 – 77 years with advanced lipedema of the legs and multiple comorbidities. Using this step-by-step approach, a short operation time and early mobilization were possible. Minor adverse effects were temporary methemoglobinemia after tumescent anesthesia and postsurgical pain. No severe adverse effects were seen. Patient satisfaction was high.

40|$|In fashion {{business}} customer demand is changing due to fashion trends and new designs. Time from customer demand to customer demand fulfillment {{is essential for}} company’s ability {{to compete in the}} fashion retailing business. During the last 20 years there has been a dramatic technical development in the production of <b>flat</b> <b>knitted</b> garments. This has made it possible to rationalize design and production in a way that it’s possible to make a knitted garment ready made directly in the knitting machine, with a minimum of after coming processes. Objective {{of this paper is to}} present a design, production and shop model for the “Knit on Demand ” concept and show of how this new production technology could be implemented in a fast fashion logistics system. A business model with the knitting machines and production equipment located in the store is presented. The customer takes part in the design process and garments are customized to fulfill actual demand. Aim is to present a lead time simulation of design- and production processes involved in the shop concept. Result is a model with starting point in customer demand and final point in demand fulfillment. Simulation shows that the customer could have an own designed garment in 2 - 5 hours. Simulation of the developed shop model is done in the software tool AutoMod. Methodology for this paper is based on a research project of the Knit on demand concept idea at the University College of Borås, literature research and discussions with suppliers of knitting production equipment. 1...|$|R
