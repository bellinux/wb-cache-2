40|$|Bacterial toxins are {{virulence}} {{factors that}} manipulate host cell functions {{and take over}} the control of vital processes of living organisms to favour microbial infection. Some toxins directly target innate immune cells, thereby annihilating a major branch of the host immune response. In this review we will focus on bacterial toxins that act from the extracellular milieu and hinder the function of macrophages and neutrophils. In particular, we will concentrate on toxins from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria that manipulate cell signalling or induce cell death by either imposing direct damage to the host cells cytoplasmic membrane or enzymatically modifying key eukaryotic targets. Outcomes regarding pathogen <b>dissemination,</b> <b>host</b> damage and disease progression will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|SummaryRhoA-inhibitory {{bacterial}} toxins, such as Staphylococcus aureus EDIN toxin, induce large transendothelial cell macroaperture (TEM) tunnels that rupture {{the host}} endothelium barrier and promote bacterial <b>dissemination.</b> <b>Host</b> cells repair these tunnels by extending actin-rich membrane waves from the TEM edges. We reveal that cyclic-AMP signaling produced by Bacillus anthracis edema toxin (ET) also induces TEM formation, which correlates with increased vascular permeability. We show that ET-induced TEM formation resembles liquid dewetting, a physical process of nucleation {{and growth of}} holes within a thin liquid film. We also identify the cellular mechanisms of tunnel closure and reveal that the I-BAR domain protein Missing in Metastasis (MIM) senses de novo membrane curvature generated by the TEM, accumulates at the TEM edge, and triggers Arp 2 / 3 -dependent actin polymerization, which induces actin-rich membrane waves that close the TEM. Thus, the balance between ET-induced TEM formation and resealing likely determines {{the integrity of the}} host endothelium barrier...|$|E
40|$|Bacteria {{of the genera}} Bacillus and Clostridium form highly {{resistant}} spores, which {{in the case of}} some pathogens act as the infectious agents. An exosporium forms the outermost layer of some spores; it plays roles in protection, adhesion, <b>dissemination,</b> <b>host</b> targeting in pathogens, and germination control. The exosporium of the Bacillus cereus group, including the anthrax pathogen, contains a 2 D-crystalline basal layer, overlaid by a hairy nap. BclA and related proteins form the hairy nap, and require ExsFA (BxpB) for their localisation on the basal layer. Until now, the identity of the main structural protein components of the basal layer were unknown. We demonstrate here that ExsY forms one of the essential components. Through heterologous expression in E. coli, we also demonstrate that ExsY can self-assemble into ordered 2 D arrays that mimic the structure of the exosporium basal layer. Self-assembly is likely {{to play an important role}} in the construction of the exosporium. The ExsY array is stable to heat and chemical denaturants, forming a robust layer that would contribute to overall spore resistance. Our structural analysis also provides novel insight into the location of other molecular components anchored onto the exosporium, such as BclA and ExsFA. This article is protected by copyright.

We infected mice that expressed Cre recombinase selectively in vascular endothelial cells or hepatocytes with a murine cytomegalovirus for which Cre-mediated recombination would generate a fluorescently labeled virus. We showed that endothelial cells and hepatocytes produced virus after direct infection. However, in the liver, the main contributor to viral load in the mouse, most viruses were produced by directly infected hepatocytes. Remarkably, although virus produced in hepatocytes spread to hepatic endothelial cells (and vice versa), there was no significant spread from the liver to other organs. Thus, the cell type producing the most viruses was not necessarily the one responsible for virus <b>dissemination</b> within the <b>host...</b>|$|R

The Nod-like {{receptor}} family pyrin domain containing 3 (NLRP 3) inflammasome, consisting of NLRP 3, ASC (the adaptor apoptosis-associated speck-like protein containing a CARD) and caspase- 1, has been implicated in protective immunity during pneumonia induced by high doses of S. pneumoniae serotype 2. Here we investigated the role of the NLRP 3 inflammasome in the host response during lethal airway infection with a low dose of serotype 3 S. pneumoniae. Mice were euthanized at predefined endpoints for analysis or observed in survival studies. In additional studies, Tlr 2 (-/-) /Tlr 4 (-/-) mice and Myd 88 (-/-) mice incapable of Toll-like receptor signaling were studied. In stark contrast with existing literature, both Nlrp 3 (-/-) and Asc(-/-) mice showed a strongly improved host defense, as reflected by a markedly reduced mortality rate accompanied by diminished bacterial growth and <b>dissemination.</b> <b>Host</b> defense was unaltered in Tlr 2 (-/-) /Tlr 4 (-/-) mice and Myd 88 (-/-) mice.

40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of {{strains of}} Neisseria gonorrhoeae to the bactericidal action of normal human sera was determined for isolates from patients with disseminated gonococcal infection and uncomplicated gonorrhea. Serum susceptibility {{was correlated with}} penicillin susceptibility and auxotype. 38 of 39 strains (97 %) of N. gonorrhoeae from Seattle patients with disseminated gonococcal infection were resistant to the complement-dependent bactericidal action of normal human sera. 36 of these were inhibited by {{less than or equal}} to mug/ml of penicillin G and required arginine, hypoxanthine, and uracil for growth on chemically defined medium (Arg-Hyx-Ura- auxotype). 12 of 43 isolates from patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea were also of the Arg-Hyx-Ura-auxotype, inhibited by {{less than or equal to}} 0. 030 mug/ml of penicillin G, and serum resistant. Of the 31 remaining strains of other auxotypes isolated from patients with uncomplicated gonorrhea, 18 (58. 1 %) were sensitive to normal human sera in titers ranging from 2 to 2, 048. The bactericidal action of normal human sera may prevent the dissemination of serum-sensitive gonococci. However, since only a small proportion of individuals infected by serum-resistant strains develop disseminated gonococcal infection, serum resistance appears to be a necessary but not a sufficient virulence factor for <b>dissemination.</b> <b>Host</b> factors such as menstruation and pharyngeal gonococcal infection may favor the dissemination of serum-resistant strains.

40|$|The {{spirochete}} Leptospira interrogans is {{a highly}} invasive pathogen of worldwide public health importance. Studies from our laboratories and another have demonstrated that L. interrogans can acquire host plasminogen on its surface. Exogenous plasminogen activators can then convert bound plasminogen into the functionally active protease plasmin. In this study, we extend upon those observations and report that leptospiral endostatin-like protein A (LenA) binds human plasminogen in a dose-dependent manner. LenA-plasminogen interactions were significantly inhibited by the lysine analog ξ-aminocaproic acid, suggesting that the lysine-binding sites on the amino-terminal kringle portion of the plasminogen molecule {{play a role in}} the binding. Previous studies have shown that LenA also binds complement regulator factor H and the extracellular matrix component laminin. Plasminogen competed with both factor H and laminin for binding to LenA, which suggests overlapping ligand-binding sites on the bacterial receptor. Finally, LenA-bound plasminogen could be converted to plasmin, which in turn degraded fibrinogen, suggesting that acquisition of host-derived plasmin by LenA may aid bacterial <b>dissemination</b> throughout <b>host</b> tissues...|$|R

Our findings collectively suggest that SECs serve to catalyze teaching and learning initiatives that enhance undergraduate opportunities in STEM. This was evidenced broadly by themes within and across levels revealing that center functions collectively serve to stimulate activity. For example, <b>dissemination</b> events <b>hosted</b> by SECs increase faculty and department interest in educational research and curricular reform.

Further, as these efforts grow, SECs also offer support and advice for the submission of grant proposals, and in some cases infrastructure for broader impacts. These examples show a clear progression of the ways that SEC functions can contribute to the initiation of new endeavors, and add momentum to current efforts. Across the six institutions, our data show that as engagement grows, a larger number of faculty had their accomplishments actually recognized, which often leads to further buy-in.|$|R
40|$|SummaryPathologically swollen {{lymph nodes}} (LNs), or buboes, {{characterize}} Yersinia pestis infection, yet how they form and function is unknown. We report that colonization of the draining LN (dLN) occurred due to trafficking of infected dendritic cells and monocytes in temporally distinct waves in response to redundant chemotactic signals, including through CCR 7, CCR 2, and sphingosine- 1 -phospate (S 1 P) receptors. Retention of multiple subsets of phagocytes within peripheral LNs using the S 1 P receptor agonist FTY 720 or S 1 P 1 -specific agonist SEW 2871 increased survival, reduced colonization of downstream LNs, and limited progression to transmission-associated septicemic or pneumonic disease states. Conditional deletion of S 1 P 1 in mononuclear phagocytes abolished node-to-node trafficking of infected cells. Thus, Y.  pestis-orchestrated LN remodeling promoted its <b>dissemination</b> via <b>host</b> cells through the lymphatic system but can be blocked by prevention of leukocyte egress from DLNs. These findings define a novel trafficking route of mononuclear phagocytes and identify S 1 P as a therapeutic target during infection...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of neoplastic cells with basement membrane molecules {{is the first}} step for the dissemination of tumor cells in vivo. Leukemic cells have a great ability to spread in the host, since cells are released from the bone marrow to the circulation. In this study we analysed whether CEM, U 937, K 562 and HL- 60 cells were able to attach to different concentrations of laminin and/or fibronectin and/or type IV collagen. Attachment to type IV collagen was low, but it increased with the addition of laminin and occurred in all four leukemic cell lines. On the other hand, attachment to fibronectin was higher, but it decreased with the addition of laminin in the assays using U 937 and HL- 60 cells. The combination of type IV collagen and fibronectin was a good substratum for cellular attachment. However, the addition of laminin to this substratum impaired its attachment activity in U 937, HL- 60 and K 562. These data suggest that laminin may control cellular attachment to the extracellular matrix during leukemic <b>dissemination</b> in <b>hosts</b> in different ways...|$|R

40|$|Herpesvirus {{transmission}} is sporadic, and infection may be asymptomatic or present only with secondary lesions after <b>dissemination.</b> Consequently <b>host</b> entry remains ill-understood. Experimental infections can be informative, but depend on inoculations that are inherently artificial and so need validation. Mice are a widely used experimental host. Alert mice inhale readily small (5. μl) liquid volumes, and Indian ink, luciferase or radiolabel delivered thus {{distributed to the}} nasopharynx and oropharynx. Murid Herpesvirus- 4 or Herpes simplex virus type 1 delivered thus infected only the nose, arguing that host entry is nasal rather than oral. Marker or virus delivery to the lung depended on general anesthesia and a large inoculum volume (30. μl), and so needs further validation of physiological relevance. While lungs could be infected at lower doses than the upper respiratory tract, tracking experiments showed that nasal inocula pass mostly into the oropharynx, even when restricted to 1. μl. Thus, the relative inefficiency of experimental upper respiratory tract infection was attributable to limited liquid retention in this site. Nonetheless low volume intranasal delivery to alert mice provides a convenient way to model experimentally an apparently natural mode of herpesvirus host entry...|$|R

In the oomycete Phytophthora infestans, the potato late blight pathogen, major shifts in mRNA profiles during developmental transitions were identified using microarrays. We used those data with search algorithms to discover about 100 motifs that are over-represented in promoters of genes up-regulated in hyphae, sporangia, sporangia undergoing zoosporogenesis, swimming zoospores, or germinated cysts forming appressoria (infection structures). Most of the putative stage-specific transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) thus identified had features typical of TFBSs such as position or orientation bias, palindromy, and conservation in related species. Each of six motifs tested in P. infestans transformants using the GUS reporter gene conferred the expected stage-specific expression pattern, and several were shown to bind nuclear proteins in gel-shift assays. Motifs linked to the appressoria-forming stage, including a functionally validated TFBS, were over-represented in promoters of genes encoding effectors and other pathogenesis-related proteins. To understand how promoter and genome architecture influence expression, we also mapped transcription patterns to the P. infestans genome assembly.

The causative agent of DF is dengue virus (genus Flavivirus) that comprises four distinct serotypes (DENV- 1 to DENV- 4).

However, {{little is known}} about the roles of these receptors in the pathogenesis of viral disease. Junctional adhesion molecule-A (JAM-A) is an IgSF protein that localizes to TJs and serves as a receptor for mammalian reovirus. We inoculated wild-type (WT) and isogenic JAM-A−/− mice perorally with reovirus and found that JAM-A is dispensable for viral replication in the intestine but required for systemic dissemination. Reovirus replication in the brain and tropism for discrete neural regions are equivalent in WT and JAM-A−/− mice following intracranial inoculation, suggesting a function for JAM-A in reovirus spread to extraintestinal sites. JAM-A promotes reovirus infection of endothelial cells, providing a conduit for the virus into the bloodstream.

40|$|Abstract Background Chronic {{periodontitis}} is {{an infectious}} {{disease of the}} periodontium, which includes the gingival epithelium, periodontal ligament and alveolar bone. The signature clinical feature of periodontitis is resorption of alveolar bone and subsequent tooth loss. The Gram-negative oral anaerobe, Porphyromonas gingivalis, is strongly associated with periodontitis, {{and it has been}} shown previously that P. gingivalis is capable of invading osteoblasts in a dose- and time-dependent manner resulting in inhibition of osteoblast differentiation and mineralization in vitro. It is not yet clear which receptors and cytoskeletal components mediate the invasive process, nor how the signaling pathways and viability of osteoblasts are affected by bacterial internalization. This study aimed to investigate these issues using an in vitro model system involving the inoculation of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277 into primary osteoblast cultures. Results It was found that binding between P. gingivalis fimbriae and integrin α 5 β 1 on osteoblasts, and subsequent peripheral condensation of actin, are essential for entry of P. gingivalis into osteoblasts. The JNK pathway was activated in invaded osteoblasts, and apoptosis was induced by repeated infections. Conclusions These observations indicate that P. gingivalis manipulates osteoblast function to promote its initial intracellular persistence by prolonging the host cell life span prior to its intercellular <b>dissemination</b> via <b>host</b> cell lysis. The identification of molecules critical to the interaction between P. gingivalis and osteoblasts will facilitate the development of new therapeutic strategies for the prevention of periodontal bone loss. </p...|$|R

We reviewed all published reports of PCA from 1967 to 2015. Cases were deemed eligible if they included the following: patient baseline characteristics (age, sex, underlying condition), evidence of proven or probable PCA, primary treatment strategy, and outcome. We identified 130 eligible cases reported from 1967 to 2015. The patients were predominantly male (63. 8 %) {{with a mean age}} of 30. 4  ±  22. 1 years.

Although the role played by components of cell-mediated immunity in the host's defense system and the mechanisms used by the pathogen to evade the host immune response are well understood, knowledge regarding the effects induced by H. capsulatum in host cells at the nuclear level is limited. According to the present findings, H. capsulatum yeast cells display a unique architectural arrangement during the intracellular infection of cultured murine alveolar macrophages, characterized as a formation of aggregates that seem to surround the host cell nucleus, resembling a crown. This extranuclear organization of yeast-aggregates generates damage on the nucleus of the host cell, producing DNA fragmentation and inducing apoptosis, even though the yeast cells are not located inside the nucleus and do not trigger changes in nuclear proteins. The current study highlights a singular intracellular arrangement of H. capsulatum yeast near to the nucleus of infected murine alveolar macrophages that may contribute to the yeast’s persistence under intracellular conditions, since this fungal pathogen may display different strategies to prevent elimination by the host's phagocytic mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Human Endogenous Retroviruses are {{expected}} to be the remnants of ancestral infections of primates by active retroviruses that have thereafter been transmitted in a Mendelian fashion. Here, we derived in silico the sequence of the putative ancestral “progenitor” element {{of one of the most}} recently amplified family—the HERV-K family—and constructed it. This element, Phoenix, produces viral particles that disclose all of the structural and functional properties of a bona-fide retrovirus, can infect mammalian, including human, cells, and integrate with the exact signature of the presently found endogenous HERV-K progeny. We also show that this element amplifies via an extracellular pathway involving reinfection, at variance with the non-LTR-retrotransposons (LINEs, SINEs) or LTR-retrotransposons, thus recapitulating ex vivo the molecular events responsible for its <b>dissemination</b> in the <b>host</b> genomes. We also show that in vitro recombinations among present-day human HERV-K (also known as ERVK) loci can similarly generate functional HERV-K elements, indicating that human cells still have the potential to produce infectious retroviruses...|$|R
40|$|Commercial shrimp Culture {{has emerged}} as one of the most {{important}} sectors of the aquaculture industry in India: The cultured shrimps in the coimtry alone contribute to 50 per cent of the total shrimp exports from India. Much of this phenomenal successs has been attributed to the production and <b>dissemination</b> of a <b>host</b> of improved technologies starting from pond preparation till harvest of the cultured shrimps. The existing knowledge structure of the farmers is further enhanced when they are exposed to more scientific farming technologies containing more attributes of the innovation which influence their adoption process. It is frequently asserted that as farrriers gain in experience or obtain more accurate and scientific knowledge, their capacity to manage shrimp ponds in a more sustainable way is enhanced. (Saengnore and Lebel, 2002). The technology adopted ranges from traditional to improved, traditional within the coastal regulation zone and extensive shrimp farming outside the coastal regulation zone (Anon. 2002) ...|$|R
40|$|SummaryListeria monocytogenes {{infected}} CD 8 α+ DCs in the spleen {{are essential}} for CD 8 + T cell generation. CD 8 α+ DCs are also necessary for Listeria expansion and <b>dissemination</b> within the <b>host.</b> The mechanisms that regulate CD 8 α+ DCs to allow Listeria expansion are unclear. We find that activating the B and T lymphocyte attenuator (BTLA), a coinhibitory receptor for T cells, suppresses, while blocking BTLA enhances, both the primary and memory CD 8 T cell responses against Listeria. Btla−/− mice have lower effector and memory CD 8 + T cells while paradoxically also being more resistant to Listeria. Although bacterial entry into Btla−/− CD 8 α+ DCs is unaffected, Listeria fails to expand within these cells. BTLA signaling limits Fas/FasL-mediated suppression of Listeria expansion within CD 8 α+ DCs to more effectively alert adaptive immune cells. This study uncovers a BTLA-mediated strategy used by the host that permits Listeria proliferation to enable increasing T cell responses for long-term protection...|$|R
