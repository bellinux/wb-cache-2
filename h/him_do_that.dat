5|$|In {{their shared}} hotel room Walter keeps Peter awake by reciting the {{chemical}} formula for root beer. The next morning Peter expresses his unhappiness with the arrangement to Olivia (Anna Torv) and tells her {{he wants to}} leave. She can't let <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> telling him that Walter refuses to work without him. The Fringe Team investigates the object that arrived in Brooklyn, a cylinder that is determined to vibrate at a particular frequency. In {{the course of the}} investigation, Walter assaults and forcibly sedates Junior Agent Astrid Farnsworth (Jasika Nicole) in order to hide the cylinder. He later meets with the bald man at a diner.|$|E
25|$|In 1310, count William III of Holland {{came to a}} {{reconciliation}} with representatives of Westergo, whereby the Frisians of Westergo acknowledged him as count and granted (!) him certain rights in their territory in exchange for him recognising certain privileges of theirs. William III had {{thought he would be}} able to quietly assume more rights over time, but the Frisians had no intention of letting <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and he got nowhere.|$|E
25|$|In {{one scene}} Hassan is {{attacked}} {{and it is}} suggested that he is raped. The filmmakers wanted Ahmad to take off his pants for the shooting, but his father refused to let <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> The boy has said that he would never have taken the role had he known Hassan would be raped. Reports vary on whether he and his family were properly informed in advance. The scene has now been depicted in a less harrowing manner than originally planned, and there is no nudity in it. Nevertheless, a body double was used to show the boy's pants being tugged slightly down.|$|E

[...] After which, while, as stiffly as ever--and it {{probably}} {{seemed to her}} impatience as stupidly--he didn't rise to it, she went on: [...] "If I offered you not again to see <b>him,</b> <b>does</b> <b>that</b> make for you the appearance--?" ...|$|R
25|$|Syed Qutb from a {{young age}} would save up his money for a man called Amsaalih, who used to sell books around the local villages. He would have a big {{collection}} of books, and another small collection specifically for Syed Qutb. If Syed never had the money, he would tell him that I don't have the money now, so let me borrow it and I'll give it you next time you come around. And Amsaalih would let <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> At the age of 12, {{he had his own}} library collection of 25 books, even though books were really expensive during that time. He would imitate the scholars by reading the books, and then give lectures {{to the rest of the}} village. If any women needed any information, they would wait till Syed Qutb came back from school, and ask him to share the knowledge he had to them. In many occasions he would be shy because he was a young man, but in some occasions he would go and teach the knowledge he had to the people who asked him.|$|E
2500|$|As for Hopkins, he {{was upset}} with the {{official}} decision {{and said that he}} was robbed of a clear points win. Hopkins said, [...] "I just really feel like I took the guy to school. I feel like I made him fight my fight, not his. I wanted him to run into my shots. I think I made <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and I think I made it look pretty easy. I think I controlled the pace, and I controlled the fight." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1979, Slash {{decided to}} form a band with his friend Steven Adler. The band never materialized, but it {{prompted}} Slash to take up an instrument. Since Adler had designated himself the role of guitarist, Slash decided {{to learn how to}} play bass. Equipped with a one-string flamenco guitar given to him by his grandmother, he began taking classes with Robert Wolin, a teacher at Fairfax Music School. During his first lesson, Slash decided to switch from bass to guitar after hearing Wolin play [...] "Brown Sugar" [...] by The Rolling Stones. His decision to play guitar was further influenced by one of his school teachers, who would play songs by Cream and Led Zeppelin for his students. As a result, Slash stated, [...] "When I heard <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> I said, 'That's what I want to do." [...] A champion BMX rider, Slash put the bike aside to devote himself to playing guitar, practicing up to 12 hours a day.|$|E
2500|$|On Boxing Day Faugheen {{returned}} to winning {{ways in the}} Christmas Hurdle after his first run of the season where a hard prep work with only few days prior of Morgiana Hurdle and the waiting tactics behind a sedate pace, later emerged as causes for the defeat with Willie Mullins claiming that Faugheen [...] "gallop before Punchestown was spectacular so I won't let <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> again". He became the fifth horse since 1969 to win back-to-back renewals of the Christmas Hurdle and faced four adversaries that included the best British hurdler The New One and Old Guard who {{was looking for a}} fourth consecutive victory after taking the Greatwood Hurdle and Bula Hurdle in his previous starts. Faugheen led all the way and approaching the last hurdle he pulled clear of the rest and won by seven lengths without being extended by Ruby Walsh who was relieved of the outcome: [...] "Yes, that was old Faugheen. I caught hold of him going to the second last, he pinged it and then he quickened really, really well." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If {{he tries}} that, he'll prob'ly lose his way," [...] said Trot. [...] "I've known <b>him</b> to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> lots of times. It's losing his way that gets him lost." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "George shoots {{better than}} I do, {{and has had}} more experience. I've seen <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> with a pistol. Of course not such a long shot, but a more {{difficult}} one." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{never knew}} <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> before," [...] ejaculated Arthur, in confusion, and heartily wishing Aleck somewhere else. [...] "I suppose {{he has taken}} a dislike to you. Dogs do sometimes, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was the Duchess {{who made}} him chuck it up," [...] she said. [...] "I {{could never have}} made <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> I was an idiot to let Parkins stay in England at all." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{original}} {{concept for}} the video was Squier's. [...] "It {{was based on}} the ritual of going to a concert," [...] Squier recalled in 2011. [...] "If we admit it, when we're getting ready to go out, we're checking our clothes and our hair." [...] His idea was to show <b>him</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that,</b> paralleled by younger fans doing the same and then sneaking out to the show. He took it to Bob Giraldi, a director at the time much sought after {{in the wake of his}} highly successful video for Michael Jackson's [...] "Beat It".|$|R
60|$|However, the Sunday after Easter {{he came to}} tea. Mrs. Leivers {{was glad}} to see him. She {{gathered}} something was fretting him, that he found things hard. He seemed to drift to her for comfort. And she was good to <b>him.</b> She <b>did</b> <b>him</b> <b>that</b> great kindness of treating him almost with reverence.|$|R
60|$|He {{took her}} hand in silence, and it seemed natural for <b>him</b> to <b>do</b> <b>that</b> reverent and tender thing which {{is no longer a}} part of our custom; he bent over it and kissed the chill, bony knuckles.|$|R

6000|$|... "He {{used to be}} {{considered}} quite a pitcher. In fact, he was so good as a boy pitcher {{that some of the}} local fans wanted him to sign up in one of the minor leagues. But of course they wouldn't let <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>that</b> because he was too young to leave school." ...|$|E
60|$|The great social idea, said Sir Joshua, was the SOCIAL {{equality}} of man. No, said Gerald, the idea was, that every man was fit {{for his own}} {{little bit of a}} task--let <b>him</b> <b>do</b> <b>that,</b> and then please himself. The unifying principle was the work in hand. Only work, the business of production, held men together. It was mechanical, but then society WAS a mechanism. Apart from work they were isolated, free to do as they liked.|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{would save}} your boy from disease," [...] said the {{stranger}} earnestly, [...] "his own professional pride or professional honour, whatever he {{might choose to}} call it, would compel <b>him</b> to <b>do</b> <b>that.</b> But the moment the doctor's work was <b>done,</b> <b>that</b> of the executioner would commence." ...|$|R
50|$|Śarabhanga (Sanskrit शरभन्ग) is a saint and anchorite {{mentioned}} in Book III (Aranya Kanda) of Ramayana. He is visited by Rama during his {{journey through the}} Dandaka forest. Lord Indra appears at his hermitage prior to Rama's visit. Śarabhanga's last wish was to put his eyes on Rama before leaving the mortal world. After seeing Rama, having performed the necessary rites, the holy man carries out a self-immolation by throwing his old body to the funeral pyre, and passes on to the heavenly Brahma's sphere. Before starting the rites, he asks Rama to watch <b>him</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It was not difficult," [...] {{continued}} Ricardo, after eyeing Schomberg fixedly for a moment. [...] "He {{was ready}} {{enough to get}} into the boat, and--here he is. He would let himself be chopped into small pieces--with a smile, mind; with a smile!--for the governor. I don't know about <b>him</b> <b>doing</b> <b>that</b> much for me; but pretty near, pretty near. I did the tying up and the untying, but he could see who was the boss. And then he knows a gentleman. A dog knows a gentleman--any dog. It's only some foreigners that don't know; and nothing can teach them, either." ...|$|R
