5|$|Balachander {{approached}} his favourite screenwriter Ganesh Patro {{to write the}} dialogues; Patro was credited for giving a native appeal to Balachander's successful Telugu films.

They planned to name the film Bilahari after the Carnatic raga of the same name, but changed it to Rudraveena to reflect the characters' anger, equating it {{to that of the}} Hindu god Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Crowley {{started the}} process of {{designing}} the Tumbler for the film by model bashing. Crowley used the nose cone of a P-38 Lightning model {{to serve as the}} chassis for the Tumbler's turbine engine. Six models of the Tumbler were built to 1:12 scale in the course of four months.

5|$|Following the {{rejection}} of the script, Roddenberry planned to convert his treatment into a novel. After his assistant Susan Sackett showed him the manuscript of a novel that actor Walter Koenig had asked her to type, Roddenberry sought Koenig's collaboration on The God Thing. Roddenberry had already produced 68 pages after working on it for a month when he handed it to Koenig, who added another 83 <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> Roddenberry received the changes enthusiastically, but a few weeks later Sackett informed Koenig that the project had been abandoned. In his 1997 autobiography Warped Factors, Koenig stated that he still had copies of the work he had completed on the book.|$|E

5|$|In an epilogue, Charlie is {{discovered}} {{by his parents}} in a catatonic state and does not show any movement despite being hit reluctantly by his father. After being admitted to a mental hospital, it is revealed that Helen actually sexually abused {{him when he was}} young, and his love for her (and empathy for her troubled youth) caused him to repress his traumatic memories. This psychological damage explains his flashbacks and derealization phases throughout the book. <b>In</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> Charlie is released, and Sam and Patrick visit him. In the epilogue, Sam, Patrick and Charlie go through the tunnel again and Charlie stands up and exclaims that he felt infinite.|$|E

5|$|In the 1840s, {{a serial}} format {{known as the}} roman-feuilleton was highly popular in France, and the most {{acclaimed}} expression of it was the socialist writing of Eugène Sue.

Writing quickly and with intense focus, Balzac produced La Cousine Bette, one of his longest novels, <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> It was published in Le Constitutionnel {{at the end of}} 1846, then collected with a companion work, Le Cousin Pons, the following year.|$|E

He finished Kubah <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>months,</b> first making a thematic overview for each chapter and then developing it further while writing.

Is Not a Fish That You Can Catch, which had only been released 14 months prior.

The band only took a break from recording to organize and perform at Summersault in 2000.

5|$|The {{design of}} the flag was {{completed}} <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>months</b> by a committee headed by Toh.

Both of these symbols were combined to create the national flag of Singapore.|$|E

Prior to this, there had been a smallpox outbreak in May–July 1963 in Stockholm, Sweden, brought from the Far East by a Swedish sailor; this had been dealt with by quarantine measures and vaccination of the local population.|$|E
5|$|This freelancing attempt did {{not start}} out well, with Benchley selling just one piece to Vanity Fair and accumulating countless {{rejections}} <b>in</b> <b>two</b> <b>months.</b> When a position as press agent for Broadway producer William A.

Benchley resigned to become a publicity director for the federal government's Aircraft Board at the beginning of 1918. His experience there was not much better, and when an opportunity was offered to return to the Tribune under new editorial management, Benchley took it.|$|E
