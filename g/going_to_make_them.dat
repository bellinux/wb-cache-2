He grew up listening to Boogie Down Productions, Public Enemy, N.W.A, and Juice Crew, and later Nine Inch Nails, Deftones, The Roots and Aphex Twin. Other influences and favorites of Shinoda's include Led Zeppelin, Run–D.M.C., The Beatles, Rage Against the Machine, Purity Ring, Arctic Monkeys and Santigold. In an interview with Rolling Stone, Shinoda explained, [...] "People just want junk food. They want throw-away junk food music that's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> lethargic and fat. We {{feel the same way about}} music. We want to hopefully move even more into being able to make more substantial music. We're definitely paying attention to the substance and the nuance, and we hope to make something that's really cutting edge and really different." ...|$|E
2500|$|Fabre {{alleged that}} the RPT had told his {{supporters}} that their fingerprints on the ballots could be traced {{and that they could}} therefore be hunted down and punished for their votes. He also repeated the accusations of vote-buying and [...] "massive" [...] fraud. Declaring that he was [...] "ready to die", Fabre led a group of UFC supporters in a protest on 7 March: [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> exhaust their stock of tear gas. We cannot let this go on, otherwise they'll hang on to power for the next 200 years." [...] Although UFC supporters formed a protective cordon around Fabre, he was sprayed with tear gas and the protesters were forced to disperse, fleeing back to the UFC headquarters.|$|E
2500|$|Two of Mick and Linda's children, Johnny and Nancy, were {{announced}} on 29 October 2013, with Sam Strike and Maddy Hill {{taking on the}} roles, and the first photo of the whole family of Mick, Linda, Johnny, Nancy, Shirley, Tina and the dog, was released. It was also revealed that Mick and Linda have a third child, Lee, who is a soldier in Afghanistan. Treadwell-Collins released a statement saying: [...] "My team have worked incredibly hard {{over the past few}} months to create the Carters—a contemporary British family with cracks, knocked edges and a touch of darkness that is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> very special to watch. A family of strong characters who love and hate each other, all rooted in the best traditions of EastEnders. Starting with Shirley, the Carters are slowly going to creep into Albert Square as Christmas approaches and by New Year, there will be a new vibrant EastEnders clan, firmly ensconced in the Queen Vic. Watch out Walford, The Carters are coming!" [...] Dyer said that Mick is protective of Nancy and does not think her fiancé, Wayne Ladlow (Malachi Kirby), is good enough for her. It was reported that Mick would be [...] "shocked" [...] to learn that Johnny is gay.|$|E
6000|$|Milt grinned irresistibly. [...] "Not a friend. But I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em.</b> I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> take up engineering, {{and some}} French, I guess, at the {{university}} there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> up {{a little}} fire in the parlor stove. I guess they won't want us round a great deal, when they come back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If they ain't {{found out}} nuthin' about <b>them</b> twins, I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> my own," [...] {{said the old}} frontiersman. [...] "I ain't got no chick nor child, an' I {{might as well be}} a-doin' somethin' for {{somebody}} in this world." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{they ought}} to know, Ozma, {{and we ought to}} know. Who's going to tell them, and how are we <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> behave?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{wanted to}} borrow a dozen monkeys, to use on Ozma's birthday," [...] {{explained}} the Wizard. [...] "We were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> small, and train them to do tricks, and put them inside Ozma's birthday cake." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> tell if they won't do it {{on their}} own account," [...] was Colonel Colby's answer. As a cadet at Putnam Hall, he had never had any use for a tale bearer.|$|E
6000|$|... "That's {{just what}} I mean," [...] he retorted. [...] "I need clean dishes, for all I have are soiled, and you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> clean or get trounced. So {{get to work}} and {{be careful not to}} break anything. If you smash a dish, the penalty is one lash from my dreadful cat-o'-nine-tails for every piece the dish breaks into," [...] and here Crinklink {{displayed}} a terrible whip that made the little girl shudder.|$|R
5000|$|... "I don't {{intend to}} go after the cities. Their {{newspapers}} are against me and they don't take me seriously. But I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stump every crossroads village between Fernandina and Pensacola and talk to the farmers and the crackers and show them their top ends were meant to be used for something better than hatracks. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> sit up and think. They won't mind mistakes in grammar if they find I'm talking horse sense." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{cruel to}} kill these things," [...] I said, [...] "for I don't know what use we are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> of <b>them,</b> {{and they must}} love life {{as much as we}} do." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Stuyvesant, [...] "I {{know they}} do, but I can't make rounds very well. And besides if I could, I {{could not make}} {{the holes in the}} side-pieces to put them into. So I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> square, and nail them right on." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] {{said our}} {{commander-in-chief}} to Lieutenant Mak, [...] "tell the niggers I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> a speech," [...] (this was received {{with a grunt}} of satisfaction), [...] "and that {{if they wish to}} have the smallest chance of overcoming their enemies, they had better give their closest attention to what I have to say." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am merely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> {{comfortable}} {{homes for}} poor but respectable women to live in. There is a class who cannot {{afford to pay}} much, yet suffer {{a great deal from}} being obliged to stay in noisy, dirty, crowded places like tenement houses and cheap lodgings. I can help a few of them and I'm going to try." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Go," [...] {{she told}} him, [...] "and bring up Negook {{and one other}} Indian. Michael's <b>going</b> <b>to</b> confess. <b>Make</b> <b>them</b> come. Take the rifle along and bring them up {{at the point of}} it if you have to." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "These {{films are}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be made {{regardless}} of who directs them. There's a market for them and the studios are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> continue <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them.</b> I've been doing this long enough, I think I can <b>make</b> <b>them</b> as good or better than anyone else." ...|$|R
6000|$|Ormsgill smiled again. [...] "I don't {{purpose to}} afford him the opportunity. He stole the boys, and I am merely <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him give <b>them</b> up again. With a little {{resolution}} I believe {{it can be}} done. Still, I am sorry to drag you into the thing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Taste life! I {{want to eat}} it," [...] cried Rilla, laughing. [...] "I want everything--everything a girl can have. I'll be fifteen {{in another}} month, and then nobody can say I'm a child any longer. I heard someone say once that the years from fifteen to {{nineteen}} are the best years in a girl's life. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> perfectly splendid--just fill them with fun." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The tarts," [...] she said; [...] "the {{raspberry}} tarts I {{was making}} for you, because you like them, and because Dora Bannister was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> for you, and I determined that I {{could do it}} {{just as well as}} she could, and that I would do it and that you would not have to miss her for anything. But it is of no use; I cannot do things as well as she can, and those tarts are not like tarts at all; they are like chimneys." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{all very}} well to say so, lads," [...] Mr. Penrose replied; [...] "but {{there is no doubt}} you showed a great deal of courage, as well as {{presence}} of mind, and you may be sure that I shall not forget it. And now, Mrs. Andrews," [...] he said, turning round to her, [...] "I feel rather in a false position. I came round to see the lads, who, when I last saw them, were not in very flourishing circumstances, and I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> a present for the service they had done me, and my daughter has brought them a basket with some wine, jelly, and other things such as are good for sick boys. Finding them as I find them, in your care and in such a home, you see I feel a difficulty about it altogether." ...|$|E
6000|$|Vergil Gunch {{summed it}} up: [...] "Fact is, we're mighty {{lucky to be}} living among a bunch of city-folks, that {{recognize}} artistic things and business-punch equally. We'd feel pretty glum if we got stuck in some Main Street burg and tried to wise up the old codgers {{to the kind of}} life we're used to here. But, by golly, there's this you got to say for 'em: Every small American town is trying to get population and modern ideals. And darn if a lot of 'em don't put it across! Somebody starts panning a rube crossroads, telling how he was there in 1900 and it consisted of one muddy street, count 'em, one, and nine hundred human clams. Well, you go back there in 1920, and you find pavements and a swell little hotel and a first-class ladies' ready-to-wear shop-real perfection, in fact! You don't want to just look at what these small towns are, {{you want to look at}} what they're aiming to become, and they all got an ambition that in the long run is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>'em</b> the finest spots on earth--they all want to be just like Zenith!" ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I’m {{a father}} of three {{beautiful}} children and you do your best to raise your kids.

[...] Craig Laundy ...|$|R
60|$|At {{last she}} saw Aunt Jane's trim little figure {{come out on}} the sands and make as {{straight}} for the children as she could, amid greetings and consultations, so with an exclamation, she jumped up and went over the shingle to meet them, finding an endeavour <b>going</b> on <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> tolerably respectable for the walk home, by shaking off the sand, and advising Val to give up her intention of dragging home a broad brown ribbon of weed with a frilled edge, all polished and shiny with wet. She was not likely to regard it as such a curiosity after a few days' experience of Rockquay, as her new friends told her.|$|R
60|$|Of {{course there}} were other people there. There was a Major Somebody who had shot things in Lapland, or somewhere of that sort; I forget what they were, but it wasn't for want of reminding. We had them cold with every meal almost, and he was {{continually}} giving us details of what they measured from tip to tip, as though he thought we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> warm under-things for the winter. I used to listen to him with a rapt attention that I thought rather suited me, and then one day I quite modestly gave the dimensions of an okapi I had shot in the Lincolnshire fens. The Major turned a beautiful Tyrian scarlet (I remember thinking at the time that I should like my bathroom hung in that colour), and I think that at that moment he almost found it in his heart to dislike me. Mrs. Babwold put on a first-aid-to-the-injured expression, and asked him why he didn't publish a book of his sporting reminiscences; it would be so interesting. She didn't remember till afterwards that he had given her two fat volumes on the subject, with his portrait and autograph as a frontispiece and an appendix on the habits of the Arctic mussel.|$|E
6000|$|... "That'll {{be about}} all from you! I've stood for your sneering at this town, and saying how ugly and dull it is. I've stood for your refusing to {{appreciate}} good fellows like Sam. I've even stood for your ridiculing our Watch Gopher Prairie Grow campaign. But one thing I'm {{not going to}} stand: I'm {{not going to stand}} my own wife being seditious. You can camouflage all you want to, but you know darn well that these radicals, as you call 'em, are opposed to the war, {{and let me tell you}} right here and now, and you and all these long-haired men and short-haired women can beef all you want to, but we're going to take these fellows, and if they ain't patriotic, we're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>them</b> be patriotic. And--Lord knows I never thought I'd have to say this to my own wife--but if you go defending these fellows, then the same thing applies to you! Next thing, I suppose you'll be yapping about free speech. Free speech! There's too much free speech and free gas and free beer and free love and all the rest of your damned mouthy freedom, and if I had my way I'd make you folks live up to the established rules of decency even if I had to take you----" ...|$|E

5000|$|Jebba as a town, {{since the}} Paper Mill closed, {{has failed to}} really provide jobs for its entire people.

60|$|By {{the time}} the two girls got down to the dining-table, every one had left the room, and there only {{remained}} one doubtful pear, and three baked apples, besides the loaf and the jug of milk. Mysie explained that not being a regular meal, no one was obliged to come punctually to it, or to come at all, but these who came tardily might fare the worse. As to the blackberries, for which Dolores inquired, the girls were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> jam of <b>them</b> themselves the next day; but Mysie added, with an effort, she would fetch some, as her cousin had had none in the gathering.|$|R
60|$|With {{a sigh of}} rapture she relapsed into silence. Matthew stirred uneasily. He felt {{glad that}} it would be Marilla and not he who would have to tell this waif of the world that the home she longed for was not to be hers after all. They drove over Lynde's Hollow, where it was already quite dark, but not so dark that Mrs. Rachel could not see them from her window vantage, and up the hill and into the long lane of Green Gables. By the time they arrived at the house Matthew was {{shrinking}} from the approaching revelation with an energy he did not understand. It was not of Marilla or himself he was thinking of the trouble this mistake was probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> for <b>them,</b> but of the child's disappointment. When he thought of that rapt light being quenched in her eyes he had an uncomfortable feeling that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> assist at murdering something--much the same feeling that came over him when he had to kill a lamb or calf or any other innocent little creature.|$|R

5000|$|Robert David Sullivan of The A.V. Club {{gave the}} episode a C-, saying [...] "I’ve been {{complaining}} about the dark humor in many Simpsons episodes this season, but it’s unimaginative dark humor that’s disappointing. I’m a champion of the episode “Homer’s Enemy,” {{all the way to}} its grim conclusion, and I love every blood-spurting moment of the Itchy and Scratchy cartoons. But “Whiskey Business” just bangs on the one note of Moe being so depressed he can’t even muster the energy to end it all. An episode that actually depicted a suicide would at least win points for <b>going</b> <b>to</b> extremes." [...] Teresa Lopez of TV Fanatic gave the episode {{two and a half stars}} out of five, saying [...] "In addition to the Moe and Lisa plots, the show also tried to shoehorn another story involving Grampa and Bart bonding when Grampa gets injured on Bart's makeshift waterslide. There were some cute moments between the two, but the episode had far too many threads <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any of <b>them</b> really satisfactory." ...|$|R
