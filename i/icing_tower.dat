40|$|Abstract: Degassing at Mount Erebus {{occurs as}} a plume from a {{persistent}} convecting anorthoclase phonolite lava lake, and by flank degassing through warm ground and fumarolic <b>ice</b> <b>towers</b> within the summit caldera. The fumarolic <b>ice</b> <b>towers</b> offer {{a unique and}} simple approach to quantifying the flank CO 2 emissions. Carbon dioxide efltuxes were determined at openings in the <b>ice</b> <b>towers</b> by measuring the CO 2 concentration, air-flow velocity, {{and size of the}} exit orifice. Fluxes ranged from < 0. 0001 to 0. 034 kg s- ~ at 43 actively degassing <b>ice</b> <b>towers.</b> Small patches of steaming warm ground contributed 0. 010 kg s-~. The ~J 3 C isotopic compositions of the CO 2 samples ranged from ~. 1 to 4. 7 % 0, suggesting a magmatic origin for the CO:. Fumarolic <b>ice</b> <b>towers</b> allow diffuse degassing to be visually identified, providing a strong advantage indetermining the total flux rate of these passive emissions. The estimated output of flank CO 2 degassing is 0. 46 kg s- 1 (40 Mg dl). Compared with direct airborne measurements of the volcanic plume, passive flank emissions constitute l ss than 2 % of the total volcanic CO 2 budget emitted from Mount Erebus. In recent years it has become apparent that degassing of magma within a volcanic edifice occurs not only by emissions from a summit crater but also by diffusive degassing around the flanks of a volcano. This is particularly true for CO 2. Significant flank degassing of CO 2 has been observed at Mount Etna (Allard et al. 1991), Kilauea (Gerlach & Graeber 1985) and Vulcano (Chiodini et al. 1996). Therefore, flank degassing through fumaroles and by soil gas emissions must be evaluated when quantifying the volatile budget of a volcano. Although some volcanoes lose only minor amounts of CO 2 via their flanks, in many others diffuse degassing {{is an important part of}} the volcanic CO 2 budget. Diffuse CO 2 emissions have been examined at numerous volcanic and geothermal areas over the last 15 years (Mori et al. 2001). At Mammot...|$|R

50|$|An ice spike is an ice formation, {{often in}} the shape of an {{inverted}} icicle, that projects upwards from the surface of a body of frozen water. Ice spikes created by natural processes on the surface of small bodies of frozen water have been reported for many decades, although their occurrence is quite rare. A mechanism for their formation, now known as the Bally - Dorsey model, was proposed in the early 20th century but this was not tested in the laboratory for many years. In recent years a number of photographs of natural ice spikes have appeared on the Internet as well as methods of producing them artificially by freezing distilled water in domestic refrigerators or freezers. This has allowed a small number of scientists to test the hypothesis in a laboratory setting and, although the experiments appear to confirm the validity of the Bally - Dorsey model, they have raised further questions about how natural ice spikes form, and more work remains to be done before the phenomenon is fully understood. Natural ice spikes can grow into shapes other than a classic spike shape, and have been variously reported as <b>ice</b> candles, <b>ice</b> <b>towers</b> or <b>ice</b> vases as there is no standard nomenclature for these other forms. One particularly unusual form takes the shape of an inverted pyramid.|$|R

40|$|She {{will never}} read this, But {{she was the}} main outlet for stress relief during the process. Salt {{deposits}} are widespread around the summit crater of the active 3794 meter high Erebus volcano in Antarctica. The distribution, composition and formation of the salts {{provide insight into the}} interaction of the gas plume with the snow and rocks around the summit crater. The greatest salt accumulations are located within 1 km of the active crater and are found under rocks and in crevices in the lava flows as white to yellow incrustations, massive deposits, efflorescences, and needles. Salt deposits are most abundant downwind of the crater where individual salt accumulations of 20 grams or more are common. The salts are not associated with fumaroles or fumarolic <b>ice</b> <b>towers</b> but form under the ambient- 15 to- 65 o C temperatures. XRD analyses of Erebus salts has led to the positive identification of alunite, calcite, gypsum, halite, khademite, mirabilite, ralstonite, sylvite, and thenardite, along with numerous tentatively identified phases. New salt phases identified in this study include rancieite, katoite, and potassian-halite. SEM observations indicate that the salts are well crystallized on a very fine scale, with crystal size ranging between 1 to 20 microns. One of the most common crystal habits consists of well-formed fiberous habit, although angular, cubic, hexagonal, needle, rectangular, spindle, stacked plate, and sub-angular habitss are also observed, along with cauliflowerand shark-tooth textures.
