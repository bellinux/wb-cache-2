50|$|Modular HRSGs can be {{categorized}} {{by a number of}} ways such as direction of exhaust gases flow or number of pressure levels. Based on the flow of exhaust gases, HRSGs are categorized into vertical and horizontal types. In horizontal type HRSGs, exhaust gas flows horizontally over vertical tubes whereas in vertical type HRSGs, exhaust gas flow vertically over horizontal tubes. Based on pressure levels, HRSGs can {{be categorized}} into single pressure and multi pressure. Single pressure HRSGs have only one steam drum and steam is generated at single pressure level whereas multi pressure HRSGs employ two (double pressure) or three (triple pressure) steam drums. As such triple pressure HRSGs consist of three sections: an LP (low pressure) section, a reheat/IP (intermediate pressure) section, and an HP (<b>high</b> <b>pressure)</b> <b>section.</b> Each section has a steam drum and an evaporator section where water is converted to steam.

50|$|In comparison, a {{compressor}} refrigerator uses an electrically powered compressor {{to increase the}} pressure on the gaseous refrigerant. The resulting hot, high-pressure gas is condensed to a liquid form by cooling in a heat exchanger ("condenser") that is exposed to the external environment (usually air in the room). The condensed refrigerant, now at a temperature near to that of the external environment, then passes through an orifice or a throttle valve into the evaporator section. The orifice or throttle valve creates a pressure drop between the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> condenser <b>section</b> and the low <b>pressure</b> evaporator <b>section.</b> The lower <b>pressure</b> in the evaporator section allows the liquid refrigerant to evaporate, which absorbs heat from the refrigerator food compartment.

In relation to this trend, energy consumption in turbomachinery {{has been increasing}} due to the scale up of both the machinery itself {{as well as the}} processing plants in which they operate.

40|$|Thermal barrier {{coatings}} (TBCs) deposited via Electron-Beam Physical Vapour Deposition (EB-PVD) {{are used to}} reduce the temperature on the metal blades situated in the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>section</b> of aircraft and stationary turbines. One {{of the most promising}} methods to improve the efficiency of these turbines is to optimize the TBCs properties through upgrade of their microstructure. The EB-PVD TBCs contain open (inter-columnar gaps and gaps between feather arms) and closed pores (intra-columnar pores) whose spatial and geometrical distribution can be altered by changing the process parameters, influencing additionally their thermal conductivity. Since such pores display large variations in size and accessibility, and exhibit high shape and distribution anisotropies, their characterization requires complex measuring methods. In this work, three different microstructures were manufactured by varying the process parameters. Their corresponding thermal conductivities were measured via the Laser Flash Analysis Method (LFA) in both the as-coated and after annealing (1100 °C/ 100 h). Analysis of the pore formation during processing was carried out by ultrasmall-angle x-ray scattering (USAXS), supported with a modelling programme developed by researchers at APS and NIST, which enables the characterization of the size, shape, volume and orientation of each of the pore populations in EB-PVD TBCs. Measurements and modelling results indicate that microstructures containing a higher volume fraction of fine anisotropic intra-columnar pores, and having larger oblate voids between the feather-arms with their planes oriented more closely with the substrate plane, correspond to lower thermal conductivity values. Inter-columnar gaps do no significantly contribute to lowering the thermal conductivity. On heat-treatment, the larger gaps between the feather-arms break up into arrays of nano-sized globular voids, and the anisotropic, elongated shapes of fine intra-columnar pores become also globular and less effective in reducing the thermal conductivity...|$|E
40|$|The {{combined}} cycle power plant is a non-linear closed loop system, {{which consists of}} the gas turbine (GT), heat recovery steam generator (HRSG), high pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) steam turbines. The gas turbine and HP, LP steam turbines operate concurrently to generate power. Through the fuel combustion process taking place inside the combustion chamber, the gas turbine is driven, after which the exhaust gas of the combustion flows into the HRSG to generate superheated steam to be used for driving the HP and LP steam turbines. The steam turbine in a {{combined cycle}} power plant {{is similar to that of}} a steam turbine in a conventional steam plant. The major difference is in the control philosophy of the turbine. In a combined cycle system, the steam turbine can be operated in two different modes; sliding pressure or fixed steam inlet pressure control. In practice, a combination of these operation modes is commonly used for {{combined cycle power plant}}s, depending on the level of power output required. During sliding pressure control, the throttling or control valves are fully open. The steam pressure is a function of the steam mass flow entering the steam turbine. When operating near the base load, most of the steam turbines of combined cycle plants operate on sliding pressure mode. In this thesis, the cause for fluctuation of the HP steam turbine governor after it gets fully opened (governor hunting), is investigated. A dynamic model is developed to represent this status of the steam turbine mainly based on the sliding pressure control mode. Being the components that cause major influence, only the HRSG's HP section, HP governor and HP, LP turbines are used for modeling. This component level modeling is done using the realistic plant operating data. The solutions are simulated using C programming with derived plant data. Whenever plant data is not available, approximated data is being used with reasonable assumptions. When compared the simulation results with the corresponding plant data, it is seen that they are in good agreement. This indicates that the developed models for the components could be used to represent the combined cycle power plant's <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>section,</b> when operating on sliding pressure control mode...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the requirements of}} a control system for active turbine tip clearance control in a generic commercial turbofan engine through design and analysis. The control objective is to articulate the shroud in the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> turbine <b>section</b> {{in order to maintain}} a certain clearance set point given several possible engine transient events. The system must also exhibit reasonable robustness to modeling uncertainties and reasonable noise rejection properties. Two actuators were chosen to fulfill such a requirement, both of which possess different levels of technological readiness: electrohydraulic servovalves and piezoelectric stacks. Identification of design constraints, desired actuator parameters, and actuator limitations are addressed in depth; all of which are intimately tied with the hardware and controller design process. Analytical demonstrations of the performance and robustness characteristics of the two axisymmetric LQG clearance control systems are presented. Takeoff simulation results show that both actuators are capable of maintaining the clearance within acceptable bounds and demonstrate robustness to parameter uncertainty. The present model-based control strategy was employed to demonstrate the tradeoff between performance, control effort, and robustness and to implement optimal state estimation in a noisy engine environment with intent to eliminate ad hoc methods for designing reliable control systems...|$|R
40|$|To achieve {{enhanced}} cooling of hot {{components in}} the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> (HP) <b>section</b> of an aeroengine, application of cooled cooling air (CCA) has been proposed. Here a “two row preswirl feed” arrangement is considered to accommodate the CCA, together with the uncooled cooling air (UCA) in <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> turbine (HPT) preswirl cavity. The CCA and UCA inflows are introduced into the preswirl cavity at two different radii. Most of the cooling air leaves the preswirl cavity from the receiver holes. To assess the CCA behavior in the preswirl cavity, a definition of feeding effectiveness is introduced based on the relative total temperature at the exit of the receiver hole. The CFD investigation for the preswirl cavity was conducted in a systematic way by altering both the radial position of the receiver hole and inflows of the CCA and UCA, while keeping other conditions unchanged. It {{was found that the}} feeding effectiveness increases as the radial position of the receiver hole decreases. An optimal feeding effectiveness close to a minimum mixing condition was achieved by adjusting the CCA and UCA inflows. Unsteady CFD investigations gave a similar prediction for the overall performance of the CCA in the preswirl cavity, but with a lower feeding effectiveness compared with its steady CFD counterpart. The reduction in the feeding effectiveness was attributed to an enhanced mixing from the discrete CCA and UCA inflows and associated unsteady effects...|$|R

Nickel-base superalloys are typically used as blades and disks in the <b>high</b> <b>pressure</b> turbine <b>section</b> because they possess excellent fatigue strength, creep strength and corrosion resistance at elevated temperatures. Components undergo thermomechanical fatigue conditions {{as a result}} of transient engine operation. Sharp geometric features, such as cooling holes in blades or fir-tree connections in disks, act as local stress raisers. The material surrounding these features are potential sites of localized inelastic deformation and crack formation. To reduce customer costs associated with unnecessary overhauls or engine down-time, gas turbine manufacturers require accurate prediction methods to determine component endurances. The influence of stress concentration severity on thermomechanical fatigue crack formation is of particular importance as cracks often initiate in these hot spots.
