5|$|The {{common loon}} {{is also known}} as the <b>great</b> <b>{{northern}}</b> <b>diver</b> in Eurasia. (Another former name, great northern loon, was a compromise proposed by the International Ornithological Committee.) It is one of five loon species that make up the genus Gavia, the only genus of the family Gaviidae and order Gaviiformes. Its closest relative is another large black-headed species, the yellow-billed loon or white-billed diver (Gavia adamsii). There are no recognised subspecies of the common loon.|$|E
5|$|The {{common loon}} or <b>great</b> <b>northern</b> <b>diver</b> (Gavia immer) {{is a large}} member of the loon, or diver, family of birds. Breeding adults have a plumage that {{includes}} a broad black head and neck with a greenish, purplish, or bluish sheen, blackish or blackish-grey upperparts, and pure whiteunderpartsexcept some black on the undertail coverts and vent. Non-breeding adults are brownish with a dark neck and head marked with dark grey-brown. Their upperparts are dark brownish-grey with an unclear pattern of squares on the shoulders, and the underparts, lower face, chin, and throat are whitish. The sexes look alike, though males are significantly larger and heavier than females. During the breeding season, they live on lakes and other waterways in Canada, the northern United States (including Alaska), {{as well as in}} southern parts of Greenland and Iceland. Small numbers breed on Svalbard and sporadically elsewhere in Arctic Eurasia. Common loons winter on both coasts of the US as far south as Mexico, and on the Atlantic coast of Europe.|$|E

2500|$|Pelican Island is only {{accessible}} by boat or chartered tours. [...] Nesting birds are easily disturbed, {{so people are}} not allowed to get too close or to disembark. [...] Visiting during nesting season (late November through late July), one can expect to see brown pelican, wood storks, white ibises, black-crowned night herons, double-crested cormorants, reddish, snowy, and great egrets, and great blue, little blue and tricolored herons. [...] Traveling in the winter, look for lesser scaup, blue-winged teal, mottled ducks, <b>great</b> <b>northern</b> <b>divers,</b> laughing gulls, American white pelicans, and red-breasted mergansers. [...] Summer visitors should watch for roseate spoonbills, magnificent frigatebirds and least terns. [...] Pelican Island also features some marine life in the Indian River including sea turtles, dolphins, and manatees.|$|R
500|$|There are {{numerous}} accounts of common threshers using the long upper lobes of their tail fins to stun prey, {{and they are}} often snagged on longlines by their tails after presumably striking at the bait. In July 1914, shark-watcher Russell J. Coles reported seeing a thresher shark use its tail to flip prey fish into its mouth, and that one fish that missed was thrown a [...] "considerable distance". On April 14, 1923, noted oceanographer W.E. Allen observed a [...] thresher shark pursuing a California smelt (Atherinopsis californiensis) off a pier at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography. The shark overtook the small fish and swung its tail above the water like a [...] "coachwhip" [...] with [...] "confusing speed", severely injuring its target. In the winter of 1865, Irish ichthyologist Harry Blake-Knox claimed to have seen a thresher shark in Dublin Bay use its tail to strike a wounded loon (probably a <b>great</b> <b>northern</b> <b>diver,</b> Gavia immer), which it then swallowed. Blake-Knox's account was subsequently disputed by other authorities, who asserted that the thresher's tail is not rigid or muscular enough to effect such a blow.|$|E
500|$|In its favoured bird manifestation the boobrie {{resembles a}} {{gigantic}} <b>great</b> <b>northern</b> <b>diver</b> or cormorant, but with white markings. According to folklorist Campbell of Islay, {{a detailed account}} of its dimensions provided by an authoritative source claims that it is [...] "larger than seventeen of the biggest eagles put together". It has a strong black beak about [...] wide and [...] in length, the final [...] of which taper like that of an eagle. The creature's neck is almost [...] long with a girth of a little under [...] Short black powerful legs lead to webbed feet with gigantic claws. An imprint of a boobrie's foot left in some lakeside mud equalled [...] "the span of a large wide-spreading pair of red deer's horns". It bellows noisily with displeasure, sounding more like a bull than a bird. The design of its wings is more conducive to swimming rather than for flight. Its evil powers when {{in the form of a}} bird were said by Campbell of Islay to have [...] "terrified a minister out of his propriety". The boobrie's insatiable appetite for livestock posed a threat to local farmers, as they relied on their animals as a means of providing income and food.|$|E

Evidently great numbers of the feathered tribes were moving about, either because they meant to retire at dissipatedly late, or had risen at unreasonably early, hours. Among them he clearly distinguished the musical note of the long-tailed duck and the harsh scream of the <b>great</b> <b>northern</b> <b>diver,</b> while the profound calmness of the weather enabled him to hear at intervals the soft blow and the lazy plash of a white whale, turning, it might be, on his other side in his water-bed on the Arctic Sea.|$|E
50|$|The crofting practises on Berneray {{encourage}} {{a wide array}} of birdlife. On early summer evenings you can sometimes hear snipe drumming, and even the rasp of a corncrake. Mute swans can be seen on Loch Brusda, and greylag geese are common. In the winter they are joined by barnacle, and a few brent geese. Ravens and buzzards are often to be seen. Golden eagles and hen harriers are rarer sights, usually in the winter. Wading birds on the shore include redshanks, sanderlings, turnstones, oyster catchers, dunlin, curlews, whimbrels, ringed plovers and herons. Further out, around the shores of Berneray, are mallards, eiders, red-breasted mergansers, and, more rarely, black-throated and <b>great</b> <b>northern</b> <b>divers.</b> Shags and cormorants fish in the seas around Berneray throughout the year, and in summer you can see gannets diving.|$|R

5000|$|The {{common loon}} {{is central to}} the plot of the children's novel <b>Great</b> <b>Northern?</b> by Arthur Ransome (in which it is {{referred}} to throughout as [...] "great northern diver", with the obsolete scientific name Colymbus immer).

60|$|The late walker or sailor, in the October evenings, {{may hear}} the murmurings of the snipe, {{circling}} over the meadows, the most spirit-like sound in nature; and still {{later in the}} autumn, when the frosts have tinged the leaves, a solitary loon pays a visit to our retired ponds, where he may lurk undisturbed till the season of moulting is passed, making the woods ring with his wild laughter. This bird, the <b>Great</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Diver,</b> well deserves its name; for when pursued with a boat, it will dive, and swim like a fish under water, for sixty rods or more, {{as fast as a}} boat can be paddled, and its pursuer, if he would discover his game again, must put his ear to the surface to hear where it comes up. When it comes to the surface, it throws the water off with one shake of its wings, and calmly swims about until again disturbed.|$|E

It is said (and beautifully insisted on, by Michelet,) that great spaces in the bones of birds that pass most of their lives in flight are filled with air: presumably the bones of the divers are made {{comparatively}} solid, or it is even conceivable--if conceptions or suppositions were of any use,--that the deep divers may take in water, to help themselves to sink. The enormous depths at which they have been caught, according to report, cannot be reached by any mere effort of strength, if the body remained as buoyant as it evidently is on the surface. The strength of the wing must, however, be enormous, for the <b>great</b> <b>northern</b> <b>diver</b> is described as swimming under water [...] "as it were with the velocity of an arrow in the air" [...] (Yarrell, vol. iii., page 431); or to keep to more measured fact, Sir William Jardine says, [...] "I have pursued this bird in a Newhaven fishing-boat with four sturdy rowers, and notwithstanding it was kept almost constantly under water by firing as soon as it appeared, the boat could not succeed in making one yard upon it" [...] (ibid., p. 432).|$|E

But this is {{followed}} by the amazing statement of Mr. Robert Dunn, p. 433, that in the act of diving it does not appear to make the least exertion, but sinks gradually under the surface, without throwing itself forward, the head being the last part that disappears. I am not fond of the word 'impossible,' but I think I am safe in saying that according to the laws of nature no buoyant body can sink merely by an act of volition; and that it must pull itself down by some hitherto unconceived action of the feet, which in this bird are immensely broad and strong, and so flat that it cannot walk with them, any more than we could with two flat boards a yard square tied to our feet; but, when it is caught on land, shoves its body along upon the ground, like a seal, by jerks. All these diving motions are executed in a more delicate but quite as wonderful way by the dabchick,--more wonderful indeed it may be said, because it has only the divided or chestnut-leaf-like foot, to strike with. We shall understand it perhaps a little better after tracing, in a future talk, the history of its relations among the smaller sea-gulls; meantime, in quitting the little dainty creature, I must plead for a daintier Latin name than it has now--'Podiceps.' No one seems to have the least idea what that means; and 'Colymbus,' diver, must be kept for the <b>great</b> <b>Northern</b> <b>Diver</b> and his deep-sea relatives, far removed from our little living ripple-line of the pools. I can't think of any one pretty enough; but for the present 'Trepida' may serve; and perhaps be applied, not improperly, to all the Grebes, with reference to their subtle and instant escape from any sudden danger. (See Stanley, p. 419.) [...] "It requires all the address of a keen sportsman to get within shot," [...] and when he does, the bird may still be too shrewd for him. [...] "I fired at the distance of thirty yards; my gun went quick as lightning, but the grebe went quicker, and scrambling over, out of sight, came up again in a few seconds perfectly unhurt." ...|$|E
