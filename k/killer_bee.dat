A would later fight in the Third Shinobi World War, where he would frequently fight with Minato Namikaze, only for all of their battles to create stalemates.

However, <b>Killer</b> <b>Bee</b> is brought back to Kumogakure, playing a role in teaching Naruto how to control Kurama's power.

While he was still loyal to Kirigakure, Kisame {{was one of the}} Seven Swordsmen of the Mist, a group of violent ninja that use particularly large swords in battle. His sword, , is a living weapon covered in scales that can absorb untold amounts of an opponent's chakra. Only allowing those it sees as worthy to wield it, Samehada can provide the user with the chakra it holds, ensuring him an infinite amount of stamina. Kisame himself has massive amounts of chakra, and by fusing Samehada into him, Kisame can assume a more shark-like form that increases his abilities. In battle, he frequently shapes water into the forms of sharks to damage opponents. After discarding Samehada when it chose <b>Killer</b> <b>Bee</b> over him, Kisame is decapitated by <b>Killer</b> <b>Bee</b> and the Raikage using Double Lariat. It is later revealed that the decapitation was just a shapeshifting technique performed by Zetsu; the real Kisame having hidden inside Samehada.

When Naruto learns that all his comrades are battling Tobi's army to protect him, he takes <b>Killer</b> <b>Bee</b> {{to join him in}} the battle, eventually cooperating with Kurama. As he fights, he becomes unconscious after Kurama is extracted from his body. When he is in a coma, Naruto meets Hagoromo Ōtsutsuki, the Sage of the Six Paths, who grants him enhanced Senjutsu that allows him to heal most of his fatal injuries he received in battle in order to face Madara, as well as making the powers of all nine tailed beasts at his disposal. After he and Sasuke fight Madara, they have to defeat Kaguya Ōtsutsuki, the creator of the Ten Tails, to prevent her from killing everyone, including themselves, on the battlefield.

The Third Hokage chose Iruka as Naruto's sensei on purpose because of their similar backgrounds. Naruto thinks of Iruka as a father-figure because of the fight against Mizuki, and Iruka, in turn, has immense faith in Naruto's potential to be a great ninja. During the Fourth Great Ninja War, Iruka is dispatched by the Allied Shinobi Forces to stop Naruto from leaving the island where he and <b>Killer</b> <b>Bee</b> are being kept safe. However, upon finding out that he was deceived, Naruto abandons Iruka, but Iruka slips Naruto a good luck note into his headband, restoring their mutual faith.

He possesses the Particle Style, a kekkei tota that combines Fire, Earth, and Wind elements to create three-dimensional shapes capable of disintegrating anything it touches, as well as the ability to alter gravity, enabling him flight. He is very proud, despite his frailty, and shows little respect to those much younger than him. During the Kage Summit, he admitted to have frequently hired Akatsuki. He defended his action, stating that the use of Akatsuki was necessary to protect themselves while still demilitarizing, but this and his advanced age still lead Mifune to deny him leadership of the forces to lead against Akatsuki.

Due to Gaara's actions and words during the meeting, Onoki reverts back to the noble man he once was before he became hard-headed. Later, he goes out to find Kabuto and prevent him from finding <b>Killer</b> <b>Bee</b> and Naruto and succeeds in protecting them. Throughout the war, Onoki's techniques proved instrumental in keeping Alliance members alive and he becomes the de-facto leader in the assault against the real Madara Uchiha.

Though Sasuke's rank initially alternated between the third and fourth spot, he has twice come first. Several items of Sasuke merchandise have been released, including plush toys with his Part I and Part II appearances, key chains, and numerous figurines. Theatergoers for the Boruto film were given two different types of fans with one of them using Sasuke and Sarada's images. NTT customers voted him their fifth favorite black haired male anime character in 2014. IGN also listed him as the seventh best Naruto character when the series ended in 2014. In a Japanese pollsters' Charapedia poll, Naruto and Sasuke's rivalry won first place. In a poll by Anime News Network, he was voted the 13th [...] "Best Guy". In developing the fighting game , CyberConnect2 CEO Hiroshi Matsuyama stated his favorite fight in making the series was the one between Sasuke and Itachi. In an interview of Mezamashi TV, Kishimoto was given questions by Nogizaka46's band member Rina Ikoma who was cosplaying as Sasuke; Kishimoto complimented Ikoma's cosplay. At New York's 2015 Comic-Con, stage moderator Christopher Butcher and editor Jo Otsuki discussed Sasuke's great popularity, noting that he became the series' most popular character. Otsuki admitted Sasuke was his own favorite character in the series. Butcher was surprised by this given Sasuke's pessimistic worldview and its contrast to Naruto's more positive outlook. Butcher wondered whether readers found Sasuke a more relatable character after the defeat of his worldview by Naruto's in the series finale. Otsuki thought that fans found Sasuke's character and abilities cooler than his rival, and given the similarities between these two characters and the series' happy ending, he thought Sasuke found a more positive worldview by the end. Animation director Chengxi Huang considered the battle between Sasuke and <b>Killer</b> <b>Bee</b> as one of best ones he saw in anime.|$|E
