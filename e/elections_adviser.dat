5000|$|The {{campaign}} {{focus on}} immigration {{may have been}} influenced by Howard's <b>election</b> <b>adviser</b> Lynton Crosby, who earlier had run similar tactics in Australian elections. Whether the hiring of Crosby was a good idea or not in hindsight, his organisation of the campaign was credited [...] with making the Conservative election drive much more professional and organised than at the previous election. Crosby was later re-hired by the Conservative Party to run their successful campaign in the 2008 London Mayor election.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} 1980s, LeWinter became {{a source for}} several writers {{investigating}} the October surprise conspiracy theory. The theory held that in late 1980, Ronald Reagan's <b>election</b> <b>advisers</b> had made an arrangement with the Iranian government. The arrangement called for the Iranians to delay the release of American diplomats held captive in Iran until after the November presidential election, {{in order to help}} Reagan defeat the incumbent President Jimmy Carter. Eventually several books were published claiming that there was indeed a conspiracy, including books by writers Barbara Honegger, Gary Sick, and Robert Parry.|$|R
50|$|Brennan {{was named}} to the U.S. Supreme Court through a recess {{appointment}} by Dwight D. Eisenhower in 1956, shortly before the 1956 presidential <b>election.</b> Presidential <b>advisers</b> thought the appointment of a Roman Catholic Democrat from the Northeast would woo critical voters in the upcoming re-election campaign for Eisenhower, a Republican.|$|R

2500|$|On 31 May 2006, a {{few days}} before the run-off <b>election</b> García's {{economic}} <b>adviser</b> Enrique Cornejo told the media that if García won in the second round, his government would renew a $422 million aid package with the International Monetary Fund. Anoop Singh, the IMF's Western Hemisphere Director, responded positively by saying he was [...] "impressed by the vision of the president-elected for Peru, especially his commitment to applying prudent economic policy." ...|$|R
5000|$|After the <b>election,</b> senior Brown <b>adviser</b> Eric Fehrnstrom {{stated that}} the turning point for Brown was the December 30 [...] "JFK ad" [...] which put the {{campaign}} on the map. [...] "After that, it was like riding a rocket ship for 2½ to 3 weeks till today," [...] he said. Another widely aired Brown TV ad featured him crisscrossing the state in his 2005 GMC Canyon pickup truck, which had amassed nearly 200,000 miles on the odometer. In his victory speech, Brown said [...] "I'm Scott Brown. I'm from Wrentham. I drive a truck." ...|$|R
5|$|Mr. Burns's {{political}} advisers {{break the}} news to Mr. Burns that he is greatly despised by many people while Bailey is beloved by all. To compensate for this, they force Mr. Burns to try being friendly and even smile. Mr. Burns makes a television commercial discussing Blinky with an actor portraying Charles Darwin, who claims Blinky is an evolutionary step and not a mutated fish. Combined with a promise to lower taxes and a smear campaign against Bailey, Mr. Burns ties {{with her in the}} polls. On the night before the <b>election,</b> Mr. Burns's <b>advisers</b> suggest that Mr. Burns have dinner at the home of a middle-class family as an opportunity to put himself in the lead. Mr. Burns scans his employees for the most average man he can find, and Homer is chosen.|$|R
2500|$|During the 2008 presidential {{election}} campaign, Senator Barack Obama advocated a full {{repeal of the}} laws barring gays and lesbians from serving in the military. Nineteen days after his <b>election,</b> Obama's <b>advisers</b> announced that plans to repeal the policy might be delayed until 2010, because Obama [...] "first wants to confer with the Joint Chiefs of Staff and his new political appointees at the Pentagon to reach a consensus, and then present legislation to Congress". As president he advocated a policy change to allow gay personnel to serve openly in the armed forces, stating that the U.S. government has {{spent millions of dollars}} replacing troops expelled from the military, including language experts fluent in Arabic, because of DADT. On the eve of the National Equality March in Washington, D.C., October 10, 2009, Obama stated in a speech before the Human Rights Campaign that he would end the ban, but he offered no timetable. Obama said in his 2010 State of the Union Address: [...] "This year, I will work with Congress and our military to finally repeal the law that denies gay Americans the right to serve the country they love because of who they are." [...] This statement was quickly followed up by Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs Chairman Michael Mullen voicing their support for a repeal of DADT.|$|R
2500|$|As expected, Obama {{swept the}} three nominating events on February 9, which {{were thought to}} favor him {{based on the results}} in similar states that had voted previously. He then scored a convincing win in Maine, where Clinton had hoped to hold her ground. The same day, Clinton's {{campaign}} announced the resignation of campaign advisor Patti Solis Doyle. Obama's momentum carried through the following week, as he scored large delegate gains in the Potomac Primaries, taking the lead in the nationwide popular vote, even under the projection most favorable to Clinton, with Florida and Michigan included. NBC News declared him [...] "Mr. Frontrunner" [...] on February 13. Clinton attempted a comeback win in the demographically more favorable state of Wisconsin, but Obama won again by a larger margin than expected. In a span of 11 days, he swept 11 contests and extended his pledged delegate lead by 120. At the end of the month, Obama had 1,192 pledged delegates to Clinton's 1,035. He also began to close the gap in superdelegates, although Clinton still led among superdelegates, 240 to 191. Clinton's campaign tried to downplay the results of the February contests, and the candidate refused to acknowledge the losses in her speeches on <b>election</b> nights. Her <b>advisers</b> acknowledged that she would need big wins in the upcoming states to turn the race around.|$|R
