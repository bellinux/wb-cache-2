5|$|Some of {{the first}} {{settlers}} lived in caves <b>dug</b> <b>out</b> of the river bank, but the city grew with construction of homes, churches, and wharves. The new landowners did not share Penn's vision of a non-congested city. Most people bought land along the Delaware River instead of spreading westward towards the Schuylkill. The lots they bought were subdivided and resold with smaller streets constructed between them. Before 1704, few people lived west of Fourth Street.|$|E
5|$|First rescue efforts {{came from}} {{surviving}} neighbours and co-workers who pulled and <b>dug</b> <b>out</b> victims from buildings. The initial informal response was soon joined by surviving policemen, firefighters and military personnel {{who began to}} arrive, as did anyone with a working vehicle; cars, trucks and delivery wagons of all kinds were enlisted to collect the wounded. A flood of victims soon began {{to arrive at the}} city's hospitals, which were quickly overwhelmed. The new military hospital, Camp Hill, admitted approximately 1400 victims on 6 December.|$|E
5|$|After {{peace was}} {{achieved}} with France in 1558, military attention shifted towards the Spanish {{threat to the}} increasingly prosperous south-west side of England. Tensions with Spain grew and invasion appeared likely in 1589, resulting in royal permission being given to reuse the stonework from the East Blockhouse for new coastal defences, but this work was not carried out. The fort continued to decay until the 20th century. With {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War in 1939, the East Blockhouse was adapted for use by the British military. The interior was cleared out and a shed was built in one corner. A slit trench was dug {{on the north side of}} the building, a rifle embrasure formed on the east side of the building, and a machine-gun position was <b>dug</b> <b>out</b> and protected with sandbags outside it.|$|E

5|$|As the long-tailed {{ground roller}} is remarkably silent and {{difficult}} to see during the non-breeding season, the local inhabitants of Madagascar once believed that this bird hibernated in its burrows. While not particularly tasty, this species is hunted for food due to its large size and the relative ease of capture compared with arboreal birds. In the early twentieth century, it was hunted by herdsmen with blowguns. In the 1950s and 1960s, natives trapped this ground roller and <b>dug</b> <b>out</b> its nesting burrows. This bird has been featured on several of Madagascar's stamps. Only one zoo, Germany's Weltvogelpark Walsrode, keeps this species. It is considered by birdwatchers {{to be one of}} the world's most elusive birds.|$|E
5|$|By 2005, the disused eastern {{trackbed}} {{was filled}} with rubble, brambles and weeds, and the station had acquired a bad reputation due to muggings {{and the use of}} illegal drugs on the station premises. A community garden project, Eastside Roots, was set up in the disused trackbed by local permaculture enthusiast Nick Ward. It was built using sustainable materials, including bricks <b>dug</b> <b>out</b> during the construction of the Cabot Circus shopping centre. The project led to a general improvement of the station ambience, and residents were more willing to use it. The footbridge was replaced in 2013 to allow for electrification of the line, but the new, higher, bridge angered local residents who felt it infringed on their privacy.|$|E
5|$|Castle Rising {{continued}} to be owned by the Howard family, and in the 19th century it was inherited by Mary Howard, and her husband Fulke Greville Howard. Fulke began to undertake restoration work, excavating {{the basement of the}} keep in 1822 and repairing some of the stonework. The ground level of the inner bailey, which had built up over the years, was lowered by about : according to the contemporary archaeologist Henry Harrod, this process required thousands of loads of earth to be <b>dug</b> <b>out</b> and removed. A great deal of medieval archaeological evidence was destroyed in the process, but the work uncovered the old Norman chapel and Harrod excavated the building in 1851. Mary continued the excavation work on the castle site after Fulke's death, and restored the stonework of the chapel.|$|E
50|$|Players' <b>dug</b> <b>outs</b> {{were moved}} from the Main Stand to the Popular Side in 1983. In September 1989, work started on nine {{executive}} boxes and an electronic scoreboard at the Dunriding Lane End.|$|R
50|$|The Greenfields Sports Ground {{features}} a small all-seater stand, some hard standing, <b>dug</b> <b>outs,</b> and floodlights. Its unusual wooden dugouts, set into a fence surrounding the pitch, were featured in David Bauckham's book Dugouts.|$|R
50|$|The club {{have built}} a stand which holds 300 people, two new <b>dug</b> <b>outs,</b> floodlights, new goalposts and new netting and a new scoreboard. Construction has started on a new {{building}} which will consist of new dressing rooms.|$|R
5|$|The Place de la Bastille still {{occupies}} most of {{the location}} of the Bastille, and the Opéra Bastille was built on the square in 1989 to commemorate the bicentennial anniversary of the storming of the prison. The surrounding area has largely been redeveloped from its 19th-century industrial past. The ditch that originally linked the defences of the fortress to the River Seine had been <b>dug</b> <b>out</b> {{at the start of the}} 19th century to form the industrial harbour of the Bassin de l'Arsenal, linked to the Canal Saint Martin, but is now a marina for pleasure boats, while the Promenade Plantée links the square with redeveloped parklands to the east.|$|E
5|$|The castle's Norman stone fortifications {{were added}} {{possibly}} {{as early as}} the 1080s onwards, and were finished before 1115, based around what is now the inner bailey of the castle, forming a stone version of a ringwork. It had four towers and a gatehouse tower along the walls, with a ditch <b>dug</b> <b>out</b> of the rock along two sides, the excavated stone being reused for the building works, and would {{have been one of the}} very first masonry castles in England. With its circular design and grand entrance tower, it has been likened to the earlier Anglo-Saxon burgheat designs. In 1096, Roger was stripped of his lands after rebelling against William II and they were reassigned to Roger's brother, Hugh.|$|E
5|$|The house {{expanded}} in several phases. In 1861, before the Del Valle family moved here permanently, they added three additional rooms {{as well as}} a free-standing cocina (kitchen). This was to keep fire away from the main building, as well as to keep it cooler. A basement was <b>dug</b> <b>out</b> as the foundation of the new rooms. In the 1870s, another wing was added perpendicular to the 1861 addition. Finally, some time after 1895, one more room was added to the new wing, {{as well as a}} breezeway to the kitchen, completing the current shape. Remodeling completed after this time was to the interior only.|$|E
50|$|In 2006, Knowsley Road was renovated slightly. On the club's new {{sponsorship}} {{deal with}} Earth Money, the stadium got new signs, new <b>dug</b> <b>outs</b> were installed, {{as were the}} toilet facilities which had been long complained about by supporters.|$|R
50|$|The {{school has}} an AstroTurf pitch: an {{all-weather}} court {{the size of}} a football pitch with <b>dug</b> <b>outs</b> and storage space. The school has 3 football and 2 rugby grass pitches and a leisure centre which is open to the public.|$|R
50|$|One side of {{the pitch}} backs on to a row of near-by houses and it is on this side where two large, brick built <b>dug</b> <b>outs</b> have been {{constructed}} with seats in to keep the players and management dry. Each dug-out could easily hold around 8 players/staff.|$|R
5|$|The son of Leslie Keith Davidson and Hilda Aileen Clifton, Davidson {{grew up in}} Lisarow, New South Wales (NSW) {{near the}} city of Gosford on the NSW Central Coast. He learnt to play cricket on a pitch that he <b>dug</b> <b>out</b> of a hill on his family's rural property. By the age of nine, he was playing in the second {{division}} of the Gosford grade competition. Throughout his high school years, he represented Northern High Schools in the state combined public schools' competition where he played against his future Test captain Richie Benaud, who captained City High Schools. During his teenage years, Davidson kept fit by working on the family property, chopping wood and carrying farm produce.|$|E
5|$|The venue was confiscated by the German {{occupation}} forces during World War II, {{who built}} a {{cold storage facility}} south of the pitch. In 1945, {{after five years of}} occupation, the pitch was in a detrimental state. The stadium received a major renovation, including a new pitch and replacing half the wooden terraces with concrete stands. The cold facility was converted to a club house and a basement was <b>dug</b> <b>out</b> and used as a changing room. In 1946, parts of Vang, including Briskebyen, were amalgamated with Hamar. The same year, Hamar Municipality signed an agreement with the club whereby municipal subsidies would cover the operating costs in exchange for the club allocating training time to other clubs.|$|E
5|$|The sloth bear, {{though not}} as {{specialised}} as polar bears and the panda, has lost several front teeth usually seen in bears, and developed a long, suctioning tongue to feed on the ants, termites, and other burrowing insects they favour. At certain times of the year, these insects can make up 90% of their diets. Some species may raid the nests of wasps and bees for the honey and immature insects, in spite of stinging from the adults. Sun bears use their long tongues to lick up both insects and honey. Fish are {{an important source of}} food for some species, and brown bears in particular gather in large numbers at salmon runs. Typically, a bear plunges into the water and seizes a fish with its jaws or front paws. The preferred parts to eat are the brain and eggs. Small burrowing mammals like rodents may be <b>dug</b> <b>out</b> and eaten.|$|E
5000|$|Tamburino Stand (Main Stand), is a {{cantilevered}} covered single tiered {{stand that}} is all-seated. The stand has some executive boxes running across its back and bar areas, the <b>dug</b> <b>outs</b> and players' tunnel, a small simple electric scoreboard, and it houses the ticket office and club shop.|$|R

5000|$|Immediately {{prior to}} the London Tigers' inaugural season at Labatt Park in 1989, {{numerous}} improvements were completed at the park costing approximately $1-million for new lights, new dressing rooms and <b>dug</b> <b>outs,</b> additional seating, field and entrance upgrades, food concession enhancements and a new 40 ft-by-19-foot electronic scoreboard (partially sponsored by Labatt Breweries). Previously, the scoreboard was changed manually.

5|$|Under the Commonwealth of England, Robert Blake {{used the}} harbour as his base during the First Anglo-Dutch War in 1652 and the Anglo Spanish War of 1654. He died {{within sight of}} the town {{returning}} from Cádiz. After the end of the Civil War in 1646, Portsmouth was among the first towns to declare CharlesII as king and subsequently began to prosper. In 1650, the first ship to be built for more than 100 years, HMS Portsmouth, was launched. Between 1650 and 1660, twelve ships were built. After the restoration of Monarchy, CharlesII married Catherine of Braganza in the Royal Garrison Church. During {{the latter half of the}} 17th century the town continued to grow; a new wharf was constructed in 1663 for military use, and in 1665 a mast pond was <b>dug</b> <b>out.</b> In 1684 a list of ships docked in Portsmouth gave evidence of its increasing national importance; the town was the only place of naval rendezvous in England at the time. Between 1667 and 1685 the town's fortifications were rebuilt; new walls were constructed with bastions and two moats were dug, making Portsmouth one of the most heavily fortified places in the world.|$|E
5|$|Some of {{the caves}} around Adams {{were subject to}} {{commercial}} ventures. In the 1860s, ice was gathered from the Ice Cave and shipped to Portland and The Dalles in years of short supply elsewhere. Oddly, a “claim” to the cave using mining laws was used {{in order to gain}} exclusive access to the ice. Cheese Cave was used for potato storage in the 1930s and later was home to the Guler Cheese Company, which produced, {{for a number of years}} in the 1950s, a bleu cheese similar to the Roquefort produced in Roquefort-sur-Soulzon, France. A legend from the Klickitats regarding the formation of the caves, involves a man and his wife who were of gigantic stature. The man left his wife and married a mouse, which became a woman. His wife was furious and because she threatened to kill the man and the “mouse-wife,” they hid farther up the mountain at a lake. The man’s wife assumed they were underground and began digging for them. In the process, she <b>dug</b> <b>out</b> the many caves in the area. Eventually, she reached the place where they were and the man allowed her to kill the “mouse-wife” to save his own life. Her blood colored the rocks of the lake red and the place was known as Hool-hool-se, which is from the Native American word for mouse. Eventually, the wife killed the man as well and lived alone in the mountains.|$|E

50|$|Two men courted a woman. One {{man should}} build a town, {{the other man}} should build an {{aqueduct}} to this town. And who would be first, he would receive her as his wife. Both done simultaneously, but that one, who had built the town, judged, that his town was not finished yet, and so the other one should marry her. With the earth, which was <b>dugged</b> <b>out</b> at {{the building of the}} aqueduct, was built a hill and on the hill a village. The name of that one, who built the aqueduct, was Rade and so is the village also called Radučka glavica.|$|R
