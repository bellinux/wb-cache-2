5|$|There were 32 IDWSs {{available}} to the Marine Corps in June 2012. The system had not been fired in combat as V-22s were routinely escorted by helicopter gunships and close air support aircraft, allowing them to focus on their transport role; squadrons also often flew without the belly gun, as the added weight reduced its cargo-carrying capacity. The Osprey's speed means that it can outrun supporting conventional helicopters, thus requiring a self-defense capability on long-range missions, and operate independently. The <b>infrared</b> <b>gun</b> camera has proven valuable for reconnaissance and surveillance. Other weapons are being studied to provide an all-quadrant defensive weapon system including nose guns, door guns, and nonlethal countermeasures {{to work with the}} current ramp-mounted machine gun and the IDWS.|$|E
50|$|Dornier {{intended}} the prototype to ready by February 1942. The machine, Wrk Nr. 1134, was a modified E-2 and equipped with FuG 202 and a Spanner-Anlage <b>Infrared</b> <b>gun</b> sight. These systems enabled the Dornier {{to detect the}} heat signature of enemy aircraft. Heat seeking detection at limited range making the Dornier a good proposition for the Defence of the Reich campaign. Testing was set back as the prototype crashed owing to engine failure. The continuing slow development of the IR equipment precluded its use in the J-1. Work on the IR program was sped up until late 1943. Modified IR equipment appeared in 1945 and was installed in the Ju 88 G-6.|$|E

500|$|The Men in Black: Alien Attack dark ride {{system was}} {{manufactured}} by MTS, with Rod Millen Special Vehicles theming {{the upper half}} of the ride vehicles. The system consists of two tracks, allowing riders of two vehicles to be pitted against each other. Each vehicle has two onboard computers which control the motion, lighting, audio and game play, with all vehicles communicating wirelessly to a central controller. The vehicles each seat six riders in two rows of three. The ride system consists of a total of 44 vehicles, allowing for 2,200 riders per hour. Riders must be [...] or taller to ride. The <b>infrared</b> <b>guns</b> mounted on the vehicles were developed by Universal in conjunction with toy and laser tag manufacturers. A patent for the ride system was filed on July 8, 1998, and was granted on April 24, 2001. The patent credits Craig Hanna, Jennifer Sauer, and Philip Hettema as the inventors, with Universal Studios as the assignee.|$|R
5000|$|T-10M (1957): Modernized {{version with}} longer M-62-T2 L/46 gun with five-baffle muzzle brake, 2-plane gun stabilizer, machine guns {{replaced}} with 14.5 mm KPVT (a better ballistic {{match for the}} new main <b>gun),</b> <b>infrared</b> night vision equipment, NBC protection. Overall length is 10.29 m.|$|R
5000|$|Other {{peripherals}} {{were released}} to add functionality. The Menacer is a wireless, <b>infrared</b> light <b>gun</b> peripheral used with compatible games. [...] Other third parties created light gun peripherals for the Genesis, {{such as the}} American Laser Games Pistol and the Konami Justifier. Released for art creation software, the Sega Mega Mouse features three buttons and is only compatible with a few games, such as Eye of the Beholder. A foam-covered bat called the BatterUP and the TeeVGolf golf club were released for both the Genesis and SNES.|$|R
5000|$|Photon players joined {{either a}} {{red or green}} team (solo games were not an option), and played in an arena. Dramatic music by Ken Caillat, strobe effects, and smoke {{machines}} {{were used in the}} arena during games to enhance play. Players gained points for shooting other players and for shooting the enemy team's base. Players lost points for being shot ("zapped" [...] in game terminology) or by shooting teammates. (A player [...] "zapping" [...] a teammate would lose a massive amount of score and be automatically [...] "zapped" [...] himself.) One feature of the game was that no player could be [...] "zapped" [...] more than three consecutive times by the same player. This forced players to vary, or [...] "clear", their targets before being able to score points on the same player again. When [...] "zapped", a player's weapon would be inert for five seconds and then reactivate automatically, with no need to [...] "charge up" [...] at a base as was required in the games of competitors. At some locations, the amount of time a player's weapon would be inert would vary based on score. A player with a high score would have an inert weapon for up to 10 seconds. For safety reasons, referees would try to enforce a rule that you must be at least 5 feet away from an opponent that you are shooting. Photon used an <b>infrared</b> <b>gun</b> and receiver system, which did not actually fire visible lasers. As technology improved and more arenas opened, IR guns using a visible laser and a built in gun site began to appear in gameplay.|$|E
40|$|Three {{different}} irrigation scheduling {{techniques were}} compared in this study; aerial infrared, hand -held infrared, and neutron moisture gage measurements. There were four treatments with three replications of each. Treatment one was scheduled using aerial infrared imaging and analyzes performed by Agrometrics, Inc. Treatment two was scheduled using a hand -held <b>infrared</b> <b>gun.</b> Irrigations for this treatment were initiated at a crop water stress index value of 0. 3. Treatments {{three and four}} were scheduled using neutron probe measurements. Treatment three was irrigated at 45 % depletion of the available soil water. Treatment four was irrigated at 45 % depletion of the available soil water until mid-bloom, when the strategy was changed to irrigate at 35 % depletion. Yield results showed {{no significant difference between}} the treatments...|$|E
40|$|The fourth NASA {{space shuttle}} flight {{incorporating}} redesigned solid rocket motors began on 4 May 1989. The flight motors were designated 360 Q 004 A (left-hand) and 360 H 004 B (right-hand); {{the mission was}} designated STS- 30 R. Overall engine performance was excellent. The low sample rate data that was available showed exceptional propulsion performance. All ballistic and mass property parameters closely matched the predicted values and were well within the required contract end item specification levels that could be assessed. No strain, vibration, or aft skirt heating environments could be addressed due to developmental flight instrumentation deletion. Infrared readings from the shuttle thermal imager were considered very good when compared with ground environment instrumentation readings taken during both the aborted and the actual countdowns. However, hand-held <b>infrared</b> <b>gun</b> reading/ground environment instrumentation comparisons were considered poor during both countdowns, {{with the exception of}} the T - 3 hour timeframe during the actual launch. Postflight inspection again verified superior performance of the insulation, phenolics, metal parts, and seals. All combustion gas was contained by the insulation in the field and case-to-nozzle joints. Inadequate parachute performance on the left-hand booster caused high splashdown loads, which resulted in a displaced nozzle and factory joint weatherseal unbond anomalies. Recommendations were made concerning improved thermal modeling and instruments. The rationale for these recommendations, the dispositions of all anomalies, and complete result details are given...|$|E
50|$|Tectoy {{was founded}} in 1987 {{by a group of}} former Sharp {{engineers}} led by Daniel Dazcal, with the purpose of making electronic toys, a niche that other Brazilian toy manufacturers had failed to notice. They quickly struck a deal to become the exclusive representative of Japanese video game giant Sega Enterprises Ltd.. Consequently, their first product was the Zillion <b>infrared</b> toy <b>gun.</b> In the coming years, they would release all of Sega's game consoles, from the Master System to the Dreamcast. Their success in the gaming field was so notable that toys became a minor part of their business.|$|R
40|$|Models are {{valuable}} tools for explaining and testing systems. Small-scale models {{can be especially}} useful for educational purposes. For models to be useful, they have to accurately depict the larger system that they are describing. A novel man-made system, known as an agrivoltaic structure, is being constructed at Biosphere 2 near Oracle, Arizona. The word agrivoltaic {{is a combination of}} agriculture and photovoltaics, or solar farming. My research involved creating a small-scale version of this system for educational purposes. The model of this system tested two predictions: that plants will grow better {{in the shade of a}} panel and that the plants will cool the solar panel through transpiration. These two predictions were tested using low-tech solutions that are affordable for classroom teachers. Predictions were tested using water and scales to measure soil moisture; <b>infrared</b> <b>guns</b> to measure plant and panel temperature; and HOBO air temperature sensors. There was little quantitative data to support the claim that plants grew better in shade than sun; however, the model system is young and may need time to grow. While some observational evidence supported the second prediction, the data was not significant. Both sets of data appeared to be highly dependent on environmental factors, such as sun position. Even without upholding the predictions, this model worked well as an educational tool, allowing students to better understand the value of research and the benefits and limitations of models...|$|R
40|$|The {{uncertainty}} of water {{supply to the}} western San Joaquin Valley of California poses certain irrigation and plant, soil, and water challenges to the established 187, 000 acres of Pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) trees. Consequently, growers have had to adapt and become more efficient with water. Evaluation of direct and indirect monitoring techniques, measuring plant water status in combination with new precision soil mapping techniques, were evaluated with the goal to conserve water and increase water use efficiency. Precision soil mapping techniques identified treatment zones by physical soil properties, mainly clay content and water holding capacity. Plant water status measurements were collected for each soil texture zone throughout the pistachio growing season using a pressure chamber device and <b>infrared</b> temperature <b>gun.</b> Yield data were collected and analyzed {{at the end of}} the season. Results demonstrated significant differences in plant water status and overall yield by soil texture zones. The high clay content soil textures zones exhibited lower water stress and higher yield as compared to the low clay content zones. The soil s physical characteristics, mainly the soil s water holding capacity, are attributed to the difference in plant water status and yield...|$|R
40|$|Objective: We {{investigated}} whether {{losses of}} inhibitory control could {{be responsible for}} some friendly-fire incidents. Background: Several factors are commonly cited to explain friendly-fire incidents, but failure of inhibitory control {{has not yet been}} explored. The Sustained Attention to Response Task (SART) could be a valid model for inhibition failures in some combat scenarios. Method: Participants completed small-arms simulations using near <b>infrared</b> emitter <b>guns,</b> confronting research assistants acting as friends or foes. In Experiment 1, seven participants completed three conditions with three different proportions of foes (high, medium, low). In Experiment 2, 13 participants completed high-foe (high-go) and low-foe (low-go) versions of a small-arms simulation as well as comparative computer tasks. Results: Participants made more friendly-fire errors (errors of commission) when foe proportion was high. A speed–accuracy trade-off was apparent, with participants who were faster to fire on foes also more likely to accidentally shoot friends. When foe proportion was higher, response times to foe stimuli were faster, and subjective workload ratings were higher. Conclusion: Failures of inhibitory control may be responsible for some friendly-fire incidents and the SART could be a suitable empirical model for some battlefield environments. The effect appears to be disproportionately greater at higher foe proportions. The exact nature of performance reductions associated with high-foe proportions requires further investigation. Application: The SART may be a useful model of friendly-fire scenarios. It could be used to indicate a soldier’s likelihood to commit a friendly-fire mistake and to identify high-risk environments...|$|R
40|$|Historically, the arc {{discharge}} analyzing technique {{was one of}} the first methods to determine the status of the insulation oil. Due to the harsh environment and the continue usage of the high voltage transformers, many problems of insulation can be produced leading to the failure of the transformer. The problem of the thesis is to find the best available solution to conduct real time analyzing of insulation oil of high voltage transformers, so that the high voltage transformer can be safeguarded from failure in the most effective and economic manner. In this work, the temperature of the insulation oil will be captured and calculated with and without partial discharge occurring. The simulated {{arc discharge}} is generated using 7. 5 kV power source in two round shape steel electrodes having 5 mm gap. This distance (between the sensor and arc discharge source) is set at 5 cm. The <b>infrared</b> thermometer (laser <b>gun)</b> was used to capture the insulation oil temperature by sending a laser light toward the insulation oil and that light will be reflected beck and received by the device and then the temperature of the oil will be captured and measured. This study will help to predict the insulation oil age of high voltage transformers, which reduce the maintenance cost of high voltage transformer...|$|R
