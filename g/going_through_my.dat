Vanilla Ice {{referred to his}} mainstream music as [...] "above-ground" [...] rather than underground, {{as he tried to}} make danceable beats and removed expletives so that the songs could reach a wider audience. A lot of his early hits had Ice boasting sexual conquests, in 1991, Ice was quoted [...] "I rap about what I know. Girls and stuff. That's what is <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>my</b> head." ...|$|E

Gaga told Access Hollywood about the shoot at Hearst Castle and the main idea behind the video: [...] "It was a great experience writing the treatment working with everyone and I was like, 'Don't touch anything, and if you knock over a sculpture I'm going to pass out!'. The intention of the video was to create something that was a true sort of road map of my journey, being an artist, a pop singer, a creative person..... It's interesting because in this video the fashion and the psychotic sort of whimsy is all happening around me and it's me almost like Alice in Wonderland <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>my</b> own rabbit hole in my brain and re-experiencing the past year of my life. Every moment that we were filming together was really joyous and really fun." ...|$|E

And then in they come and start wheeling my halves off in opposite directions. I was like 'hey, {{what are you guys}} doing?' At least they put me back together again afterwards - Although it was a while before I agreed to be sawed in half again." ...|$|R

Zoe told in interview that “Phir Mili Tanhai” {{was one of}} the very first songs she wrote and was inspired by her real relationship. [...] "Phir Mili Tanhai {{was one of the}} very first songs I wrote. In fact it’s a marker of the period when I turned to songwriting in the first place.

5000|$|In an interview, Larson stated, [...] "I {{think that}} I write about stuff that others don't write about. I don't {{have a bunch}} of love songs cause I don't really have much boy experience. I just write about what I am {{actually}} <b>going</b> <b>through</b> in <b>my</b> real life. That's where the title from my album comes from - Finally out of P.E. My P.E. teacher didn't like me at all, which was hard to deal with cause I was usually such a teachers' pet.

Someone asked me, 'Why are you so fucked up?', 'Well, I am from America.' I hate the fact that so many people have fucked the country up, and so many people fucked up my personal life and I allowed it to happen. So in a way, I feel like America as a whole feels, but in no way does that make me a tree-hugging patriotic freedom rocker." ...|$|R

By the time of his election to Congress in 1984 he was drinking [...] "eight, ten, twelve martinis a night at receptions and fundraisers." [...] In 1985 DeLay became a born-again Christian, and gave up hard liquor. Of the Rev. Ken Wilde, an evangelical minister from Idaho who founded the National Prayer Center in Washington, D.C., which houses volunteers who come to the capital to pray for the nation's leaders, DeLay said, [...] "This is the man who really saved me.

2500|$|Douglas Yancey [...] "Doug" [...] Funnie (Billy West in the Nickelodeon series; Tom McHugh in the Disney series): Doug is {{depicted}} as an introverted, quiet, insecure, and naive 11(later 12)-year-old boy who {{more often than not}} tries to deal with his fears of failure and of social rejection. He has talents for writing, drawing, making music (he plays a banjo), and caring for animals (he owns a dog named Porkchop). While Doug just wants to fit in with his peers, he possesses quite an imagination and a strong sense of morality that both make him stand out amongs them. Doug narrates every episode, and writes his experiences in his journal. His alter ego, Quailman, was inspired by Jinkins' and Roberts' home movies as children, posing as superheroes. Billy West, the original voice behind Doug, was assigned by executive Vanessa Coffey, to Jinkins' initial reluctance. Despite this, he would come to view it as the best possible voice for the character. West, in recording lines for Doug, noted that [...] "There's a lot of me in there, because I'm <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>my</b> own experiences in there, because I have a conscience." ...|$|E

5000|$|... "Scarless" [...] {{was written}} by Paulini, Thanh Bui and Alfred Tuohey. Lyrically, the song is about a {{long-term}} abusive relationship Paulini had in 2006 with Australian rugby league footballer Wes Naiqama. She wrote [...] "Scarless" [...] to help other victims of domestic violence. In an interview with The Daily Telegraph, Paulini said [...] "I've never spoken about it because really, when it first happened, I've got to say I {{just wanted to go}} into a hotel room and hide away. It was difficult for me to talk about because not only was I <b>going</b> <b>through</b> it, <b>my</b> family and friends were, too. I wasn't strong enough then like I am now.

You know, push that interview to the side, I'm happy as a clam to have written a song that is still being played and still dug by so many people.

[...] During the songwriting process for Laundry Service, Shakira wrote [...] "Underneath Your Clothes" [...] as a love song for de la Rúa.

In February 2005, Landon Jr. explained how the screenplay was conceived, saying [...] "The movie was centered around the divorce, and that was my main reason for making the film. I basically used the guidelines my father had set in his Life magazine article, the last interview he gave before he died. The movie put things in perspective {{from my point of view}} — the affair, his drinking, everything in the Life article. I went by the parameters set by my father in that article, and I was not going to disrespect those parameters. The only difference was that it was exploring what I was <b>going</b> <b>through,</b> and <b>my</b> brothers and sisters were going through." ...|$|R

60|$|For a {{time we did}} {{not meet}} very frequently, though always she professed an unblushing {{preference}} for my company, and talked my views and sought me out.

She would {{come up to the}} office, and sit by the window, and talk over the proofs of the next week's articles, <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>my</b> intentions with a keen investigatory scalpel. Her talk always puts me in mind of a steel blade. Her writing became rapidly very good; she had a wit and a turn of the phrase that was all her own. We seemed to have forgotten the little shadow of embarrassment that had fallen over our last meeting at Oxford. Everything seemed natural and easy between us in those days; a little unconventional, but that made it all the brighter.|$|E

But I'm mighty glad I came; I wouldn't have missed YOU for a thousand dollars. You see I haven't struck anyone I cared to talk to since." [...] Here he suddenly remarked that she hadn't looked at him, and that the delicate whiteness of her neck was quite suffused with pink, and stopped instantly. Presently he said quite easily: ...|$|E

I had intended to invest it, but in my muddled state put off doing so, and had gone on paying the interest {{as if it had}} been invested as ordered. When I knew that I had not enough in the bank to replace it, I went into foolish speculations to regain what I had lost; but until the crash came I had never fairly realised that I had not only ruined myself but was a swindler. I shall never forget the morning when James, who had been up all night <b>going</b> <b>through</b> <b>my</b> papers with my head-clerk, came down and told me what he had discovered. I was still stupid from what I had drunk overnight, but that sobered me. I need not tell you what passed between my son and me. I swore never to touch liquor again. He sold out of consols five thousand pounds which he had inherited from his mother, and handed it over to the man I had defrauded, giving him his personal bond that he would repay the rest of the money, should he live; and on those terms my client agreed to abstain from prosecuting me, and to maintain an absolute silence as to the affair.|$|E
