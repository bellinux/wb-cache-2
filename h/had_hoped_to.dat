5|$|Proctor's Theater: A 1914 {{theater on}} Fourth Street transitioned {{smoothly}} between live-entertainment and motion-picture eras.

5|$|Both the Austro-Hungarians and the Serbs {{suffered}} heavy casualties, {{with more}} than 20,000 dead on each side. The defeat humiliated Austria-Hungary, which <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> occupy Serbia {{by the end of}} 1914. On 22 December, Potiorek and von Frank were relieved of their respective commands, and the 5th and 6th armies were merged into a single 5th Army of 95,000 men.|$|E

5|$|In 1910, Whitehead {{resigned}} {{his senior}} lectureship in mathematics at Trinity {{and moved to}} London without first lining up another job. After being unemployed for a year, Whitehead accepted a position as lecturer in applied mathematics and mechanics at University College London, but was passed over a year later for the Goldsmid Chair of Applied Mathematics and Mechanics, a position for which he <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> be seriously considered.|$|E
5|$|In 1971, the IOC, at its Amsterdam session, {{voted to}} strip the South African NOC of recognition. Although Brundage <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> keep South Africa within the Olympic movement, he {{believed}} that those who sought its expulsion had made the stronger case. South Africa {{did not return to}} the Olympics until the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona, after the end of its apartheid government.|$|E

5|$|In October 1942, the Germans {{began to}} {{implement}} compulsory deportation of Belgian workers {{to work in}} German factories.

5|$|The Qinghe Special Steel Corporation ltd, {{established}} in 1987, {{had originally been}} a state-owned enterprise, and had been restructured into a private business.

5|$|Bryan <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> {{sweep the}} rural vote and make inroads on urban labor, {{but he was}} not successful. McKinley became the first Republican {{candidate}} to win in New York City, and won in its rival city of Brooklyn as well. He lost only one city with a population of over 45,000 in the Midwest, and won many rural counties in crucial states. Although Bryan won all states south of Kentucky and from Texas east, McKinley won most urban centers there.|$|E
5|$|Cagney's {{two films}} of 1938, Boy Meets Girl and Angels with Dirty Faces, both costarred Pat O'Brien. The former had Cagney {{in a comedy}} role, and {{received}} mixed reviews. Warner Bros. had allowed Cagney his change of pace, but was keen {{to get him back}} to playing tough guys, which was more lucrative. Ironically, the script for Angels was one that Cagney <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> do while with Grand National, but the studio had been unable to secure funding.|$|E
5|$|Chatwin <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> read Classics at Merton College, Oxford, {{but the end}} of National Service in the United Kingdom meant {{there was}} more {{competition}} for university places. He was forced to consider other options. His parents discouraged the ideas he offered—an acting career or work in the Colonial Service in Kenya. Instead, Chatwin's father asked one of his clients for a letter of introduction to the auction house Sotheby's. An interview was arranged, and Chatwin secured a job there.|$|E

5|$|Colbert {{attended}} Charleston's Episcopal Porter-Gaud School, {{where he}} participated in several school plays {{and contributed to the}} school newspaper but was not highly motivated academically. During his adolescence, he briefly fronted A Shot in the Dark, a Rolling Stones cover band. When he was younger, he <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> study marine biology, but surgery intended to repair a severely perforated eardrum caused him inner ear damage. The damage was severe enough that he was unable to pursue a career that would involve scuba diving. The damage also left him deaf in his right ear.|$|E
5|$|Coolbrith <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> {{tour the}} East Coast and Europe with Miller, but stayed behind in San Francisco {{because she felt}} obliged {{to care for her}} mother and her seriously ill, widowed sister Agnes who was unable to care for herself or for her two children.

5|$|For Cagney's next film, he {{traveled}} to Ireland for Shake Hands with the Devil, directed by Michael Anderson. Cagney <b>had</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>to</b> spend some time tracing his Irish ancestry, but time constraints and poor weather meant that {{he was unable to}} do so. The overriding message of violence inevitably leading to more violence attracted Cagney to the role of an Irish Republican Army commander, and resulted in what some critics would regard as the finest performance of his final years.|$|E
