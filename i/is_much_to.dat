5|$|A mutant who can freeze {{objects and}} create ice. His family is unaware {{that he is}} a mutant and simply {{believes}} he is at a boarding school. After returning home, Bobby reveals to them what he actually <b>is,</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> his brother's derision. He is also Rogue's boyfriend.|$|E
5|$|Trying to {{sort out}} what has happened, Hermie goes back to Dorothy's house. Dorothy has fled the island {{in the night and}} an {{envelope}} is tacked to the front door with Hermie's name on it. Inside is a note from Dorothy, saying she hopes he understands she must go back home as there <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> do. She assures Hermie she will never forget him, and he will find his way of remembering what happened that night. Her note closes with the hope that Hermie may be spared the senseless tragedies of life.|$|E
5|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved. Early fossil tetrapods have been found in marine sediments, and because fossils of primitive tetrapods in general are found scattered all around the world, they must have spread by following the coastal lines — they could not have lived in freshwater only.|$|E

5|$|Nicky is {{persuaded to}} drop out of {{university}} and work for corrupt local politician Austin Donohue (Alun Armstrong), swayed by Donohue's apparent idealism and desire to change Newcastle for the better. This <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> the annoyance of Nicky's trade unionist father Felix (Peter Vaughan), who does not want his son to waste opportunities that he never had when he was Nicky's age. Nicky's relationship with Mary ends when she becomes pregnant by Tosker and later marries him, which means she also drops out of university. On the run from a pregnant girlfriend himself and his abusive alcoholic father, Geordie leaves for London, where he falls in with seedy underworld baron Benny Barrett (Malcolm McDowell).|$|E
25|$|People {{should and}} {{do have a}} {{constitutional}} right to criticize Israel, even harshly, including challenging its right to exist. There must be robust debate about the wisdom of Israel's policies, and there <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> criticize.|$|E
25|$|The series {{revolves}} around {{the daily lives of}} two 23-year-old friends, Mordecai (a blue jay), and Rigby (a raccoon). They work as groundskeepers at a park, and spend their days trying to avoid work and entertain themselves by any means. This <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> the chagrin of their manager/boss Benson (a gumball machine) and their coworker Skips (a yeti), but to the delight of their (other) manager/boss Pops (a man with a lollipop-shaped head). Other coworkers include an overweight green man called Muscle Man, and a ghost called Hi-Five Ghost.|$|E

25|$|Trinidad has a rich {{tapestry}} of cultures which create occasions for celebrations beyond many's expectations {{for a small}} Caribbean island; thus there <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> see and do after work hours in Port of Spain, even long after the annual Carnival celebration. While {{the popularity of the}} major shopping area around Frederick Street as a nightspot centre has remained steady or declined, expansion of entertainment venues into the malls and outlying towns has occurred. St. James, 'uptown' Port of Spain (St. Clair and Woodbrook) have seen a boom in nightclubs, sports bars and fine dining restaurants as workers from government offices and large corporations disgorge on evenings from high-rise headquarters built in newly commercialized formerly upscale neighbourhoods.|$|E
25|$|The {{distress}} of the King's loyal American {{subjects who}} have been driven from their habitations and deprived of their property by the rebels has been an object of attention with His Majesty and Parliament from the first appearance of the rebellion; and very considerable sums have been expended in furnishing them with a temporary support. But, as their number is daily increasing and <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be apprehended (if a reconciliation does not soon take place) that scarcely any who retain their principles will be suffered {{to remain in the}} revolted provinces, it is judged proper in that event that a permanent provision should be made by which they may be enabled to support themselves and their families without being a continual burden upon the revenue of Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} Devonian, land plants had {{stabilized}} freshwater habitats, allowing the first wetland ecosystems to develop, with increasingly complex food webs that afforded new opportunities. Freshwater habitats {{were not the}} only places to find water filled with organic matter and choked with plants with dense vegetation near the water's edge. Swampy habitats like shallow wetlands, coastal lagoons and large brackish river deltas also existed at this time, and there <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> suggest that {{this is the kind of}} environment in which the tetrapods evolved.

25|$|Because of {{the damage}} done to his estate in Lacoste, which was sacked in 1789 by an angry mob, he moved to Paris. In 1790, {{he was elected to the}} National Convention, where he {{represented}} the far left. He was a member of the Piques section, notorious for its radical views. He wrote several political pamphlets, in which he called for the implementation of direct vote. However, there <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> suggest that he suffered abuse from his fellow revolutionaries due to his aristocratic background. Matters were not helped by his son's May 1792 desertion from the military, where he had been serving as a second lieutenant and the aide-de-camp to an important colonel, the Marquis de Toulengeon. Sade was forced to disavow his son's desertion in order to save himself. Later that year, his name was added – whether by error or wilful malice – to the list of émigrés of the Bouches-du-Rhône department.|$|E
25|$|Bareḳet (בָּרֶקֶת = in the masoretic text) / Smaragdos (in the Septuagint) - Bareketh {{etymologically}} means ‘lightning flash’, whence shimmering or shiny. Smaragdos is cognate with Emerald, {{and literally}} means green stone, but is {{somewhat of a}} false friend as the Greek term could apply {{to a number of}} different green gems, not just the emerald in particular. Smaragdos was often used in Greek literature to refer to an intensely bright crystal found in columnar formations. Emerald in the proper sense of green beryl exists locally in Egypt. Items carved from emerald are known from as early as the 12th Dynasty, 1900s BCE, during the Bronze Age. But these emeralds are random finds, and not actively mined until the Ptolemaic period. Cleopatra, the last of the Ptolemies, is famous for her love for the Egyptian emerald. Other minerals resembling emerald are heliodor (taking into account the implication of Smaragdos that it was green) and rock crystal (ignoring the literal meaning of Smaragdos, since the masoretic text doesn't appear to specify colour); there <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be said for Smaragdos being either of those. Although “emerald” is the most common form used to describe the Hebrew word, bareḳet, in other sources (e.g. the Septuagint on Ezek. 28:13), the word bareḳet is rendered as “onyx.” Aquilas the proselyte (Onkelos), in his Aramaic translation of the Pentateuch, writes בָרקָן = barḳan, for this word. According to the Midrash Rabba (Numbers Rabba 2:7), the stone called bareḳet had veins or parallel bands of colours white, black and red running through it, suggesting that it may have actually been a kind of agate or onyx. This may explain why in some French translations the word is rendered as “agate.” In the South Arabian dialect spoken in Yemen during the Middle Ages, baḳarani (believed to be a corruption of barḳan) was an exceptionally beautiful and rare onyx stone mined on Mount Anis, in Yemen, one variety of which having a red surface with a vein of white over another of black running through it. Symmachus, an ancient Jewish translator whose Greek translation of the Pentateuch appeared in Origen's Hexapla, has also written κεραύνιος (=onyx) for the stone known in Hebrew as bareḳet in Exo. 28:17.|$|E

500|$|... "Flop Starz" [...] is {{the first}} segment for the first {{official}} aired episode of the animated television series Phineas and Ferb. (After the pilot episode Rollercoaster (Phineas and Ferb)). The episode was originally broadcast on Disney Channel on February 1, 2008. In the episode, Phineas and Ferb become one-hit wonders {{in the matter of}} a morning. This <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> the disappointment of Candace, who is trying out for super stardom on a competition show titled The Next American Pop Teen Idol Star! Meanwhile, Doofenshmirtz converts his building into a giant robot to aid him in his attempt to conquer the tri-state area.|$|E
500|$|While some reviewers have {{praised the}} film for its {{ostensible}} [...] "historical accuracy", others have strongly questioned its adherence to historical fact. Dr. Malcolm Gaskill, Fellow and former Director of Studies in history at Churchill College, Cambridge, {{and author of}} Witchfinders: A 17th-Century English Tragedy, critiqued the film for the Channel 4 History website, calling it [...] "a travesty of historical truth" [...] while acknowledging that [...] "there <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be said in favour of Witchfinder General–but as a film, not as history." [...] Based purely on its level of historical accuracy, Gaskill gave the film [...] "3 stars" [...] {{on a scale of}} 0–10.|$|E

[...] The Cambridge University Boat Club secretary Charles Bagot wrote: [...] "It <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> be regretted that a foul should have taken place, as, besides rendering the race an imperfect test of {{the merits of the}} respective crews, it very much disturbed the harmony and good feeling which should exist between members of the rival Universities in such contests."

Federalist supporters of the Constitution could not overcome the protest caused by Mason's phrase 'There is no declaration of rights'."

500|$|The philosopher Michael Ruse {{wrote in}} [...] (1988) that Bell et al.′s {{findings}} about the parental backgrounds of heterosexuals and homosexuals were [...] "slanted {{in the way}} a Freudian would expect", adding that many other studies have pointed to very similar conclusions. Ruse argued that there <b>is</b> <b>much</b> <b>to</b> support Bell et al.′s conclusion that Freudian explanations of homosexuality confuse the direction of cause and effect and that the cold and distant relationships gay men report having with their fathers are a result of parental reactions to effeminate or sensitive sons. However, he noted that the accuracy of Bell et al.′s findings is open to doubt for many reasons: their subjects could have been unwittingly giving them the answers they wanted to hear, failed to remember accurately, or suppressed painful childhood memories.|$|E
