At the same time, there was another school of Jewish thought that emphasized traditional study and a Jewish response to the <b>ethical</b> <b>problems</b> of antisemitism and persecution, one form {{of which was the}} Musar movement. Polish Jews generally were less influenced by Haskalah, rather focusing on a strong continuation of their religious lives based on Halakha ("rabbis's law") following primarily Orthodox Judaism, Hasidic Judaism, and also adapting to the new Religious Zionism of the Mizrachi movement later in the 19th century.|$|E

25|$|Historically, LDLT {{began with}} {{terminal}} pediatric patients, {{whose parents were}} motivated to risk donating {{a portion of their}} compatible healthy livers to replace their children's failing ones. The first report of successful LDLT was by Dr. Christoph Broelsch at the University of Chicago Medical Center in November 1989, when two-year-old Alyssa Smith received a portion of her mother's liver. Surgeons eventually realized that adult-to-adult LDLT was also possible, and now the practice is common in a few reputable medical institutes. It is considered more technically demanding than even standard, cadaveric donor liver transplantation, and also poses the <b>ethical</b> <b>problems</b> underlying the indication of a major surgical operation (hemihepatectomy or related procedure) on a healthy human being. In various case series, the risk of complications in the donor is around 10%, and very occasionally a second operation is needed. Common problems are biliary fistula, gastric stasis and infections; they are more common after removal of the right lobe of the liver. Death after LDLT has been reported at 0% (Japan), 0.3% (USA) and <1% (Europe), with risks likely to decrease further as surgeons gain more experience in this procedure. Since the law was changed to permit altruistic non-directed living organ donations in the UK in 2006, the first altruistic living liver donation took place in Britain in December 2012.|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] In the present study, two CFH were designed in combination with ethical problem-solving guidelines. Two types of links, embedded links and question links, were used to foster crisscrossing navigation of the CFH and enhance performance in problem solving in engineering ethics. The main {{purpose of the study was}} two-fold: (a) Determine if the two types of links, question and embedded, differ significantly in promoting students' engineering <b>ethical</b> <b>problem</b> solving performance and on usage of website; (b) Determine if epistemological beliefs and moral judgment influence students' engineering <b>ethical</b> <b>problem</b> solving performance. Results indicated there were significant differences in <b>ethical</b> <b>problem</b> solving performance between the two groups who used two CFH. The question link and embedded link groups used the three cases similarly, however, question links were more frequently used than the embedded links, and in the question link group, a significantly larger number of participants used the question links. The influence of the use of question links and embedded links on participants' performance was different as well. Results also indicated that epistemological development was not a significant predictor for <b>ethical</b> <b>problem</b> solving performance in the two groups; while participants' moral reasoning skills did not influence <b>ethical</b> <b>problem</b> solving performance in the question link group, for the embedded link group, both P scores and N 2 scores were significant predictors for total case analysis scores...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to investigate possible relationships between religiosity levels, personal moral philosophies, ethical perceptions and intentions of associate’s and bachelor’s degree students. Therefore, a survey was conducted on 189 business administration students chosen through convenience sampling at Balıkesir University. In order to measure the respondents’ levels of religiosity and personal moral philosophies, some scales with established validity and reliability in literature were used. Religiosity variable was analyzed both uni- and multi-dimensionally to make a deeper analysis with multidimensional scales. To assess perceived <b>ethical</b> <b>problem</b> and <b>ethical</b> intentions variable, one question for each was developed with scenario method. Structural Equation Model was used in data analysis. The proposed model was composed of seven hypotheses. Religiosity level was independent variable in four of them. In the structure where religiosity variable was used uni-dimensionally, three of the hypotheses were accepted while one of them was rejected. On the other hand, in multidimensional construct three of the hypotheses were partly accepted whereas one of them was rejected. Regarding the three hypotheses without religiosity variable, perceived <b>ethical</b> <b>problem</b> was detected to have a relationship with ethical intentions; nevertheless, no relationship was found between personal moral philosophies (idealism and relativism) and perceived <b>ethical</b> <b>problem...</b>|$|R

500|$|In Aesthetic Realism {{classes and}} lessons, Koppelman learned that <b>ethical</b> <b>problems</b> are also artistic problems.

He learned he could go after precision in the studio as penance for being careless at other times, wanting {{to get away from}} things. [...] As freedom and order, truth and imagination became more integrated in his life, his art became more imaginative. “I had always had a classical bent in my work,” he wrote. “But there was also a wildness in me that had not come into my work sufficiently or gracefully.” As a result of his study, Koppelman noted, “Tightness and abandon, the classical and the wild, even the conservative and the rebel seemed to be working better together” resulting in art that was “more imaginative, freer in concept” [...] Boldness of imagination and an unerring sense of detail were two qualities Koppelman’s work became noted for.|$|E

In an article in the Society of Professional Journalists' Quill Magazine, Waite is paraphrased as saying that he approaches ethical questions of drone journalism by first checking to see whether a question has been dealt with before, as many of questions in drone journalism debates have already been raised with regard to journalistic use of telephoto lenses and helicopters.

2500|$|Photojournalism works {{within the}} same ethical {{approaches}} to objectivity that are applied by other journalists. What to shoot, how to frame and how to edit are constant considerations. Photographing news for an assignment {{is one of the}} most <b>ethical</b> <b>problems</b> photographers face.

The public is attracted to gruesome photographs and dramatic stories. A lot of controversy arises when deciding which photographs are too violent to show the public.|$|E
2500|$|Memory reconsolidation is {{a process}} of {{retrieving}} and altering a pre-existing long-term memory. Reconsolidation after retrieval can be used to strengthen existing memories and update or integrate new information. This allows a memory to be dynamic and plastic in nature. Just like in consolidation of memory, reconsolidation, involves the synthesis of proteins. Inhibition of this protein synthesis directly before or after retrieval of a traumatic memory can disrupt expression of that memory. When a memory is reactivated it goes into a labile state, making it possible to treat patients with post-traumatic stress disorder or other similar anxiety based disorders. This is done by reactivating a memory so that it causes the process of reconsolidation to begin. [...] One source described the process this way: [...] "ld information is called to mind, modified with the help of drugs or behavioral interventions, and then re-stored with new information incorporated." [...] There are some serious <b>ethical</b> <b>problems</b> with this process as the reactivation of traumatic memories can be very harmful and in some cases cause anxiety attacks and extreme levels of stress. Inhibition of reconsolidation is possible through pharmacological means. The administration of several different types of protein synthesis antagonists can be used to block protein synthesis that occurs after a traumatic memory is reactivated. The inhibition of creation of new proteins will stop the reconsolidation process and make the memory imperfect.|$|E
