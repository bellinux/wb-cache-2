40|$|I visited Hagihara Industries in Kurashiki City, Okayama Prefecture, in April 2013, {{finding a}} fascinating, highly {{specialized}} textile company. The company {{was founded in}} 1892, when Fuichi Hagihara entered the tatami (Japanese floor mat) business. In 1946, his son Fuichi Hagihara II entered the company, and in the 1950 s invented a very thin polyester monofilament called “flat yarn” to replace the cotton thread holding the mat reeds together. In 1962, the son established Hagihara Industries to produce <b>flat</b> <b>yarn</b> based on equipment he developed and built. Today, the company – still managed by the Hagihara family – produces {{a wide range of}} products for industrial uses based on <b>flat</b> <b>yarn.</b> It has two divisions: the synthetic resinprocessed product division makes and sells processed synthetic-resin related products based on <b>flat</b> <b>yarn,</b> and comprises about three-quarters of sales; and the machinery product division designs, manufactures, and sells automation equipment such as slit and winder machinery, a quarter of sales. Its two main strengths are its commitment to innovation and maintenance of a strong corporate culture, emphasizing quality, close working relationships, interdependence, and a widespread feeling of ownership by the workers. Hagihara Industries {{is an example of a}} Japanese small listed enterprise that manufactures niche products for broad markets, as distinguished from small- and medium-sized enterprises that sell most of their output to a dominant customer. From tatami to high-tech synthetic-fiber products, the company has woven a history of innovation...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the past of the poli (ethylenterephtalate) fibres, their {{advantages}} and limitations, and the alternative polyesters. Reference is made to the raw materials used to-day, to the oil crisis and its incidence {{on the cost of}} polyester fibres. The long world crisis has generated new processes and products. Of the new processes, reference is made to the substitution of the dymethyl tereghtalate by the terephtalatic acid, ahe continuous polimerization and the development sf highspeed spinning processes which have originated the MOY (medium oriented yarn) and POY (preoriented yarn) continuous yarns, used in texturization, and the HOY and FOY (high or full oriented yarn) continuous <b>yarn,</b> used as <b>flat</b> <b>yarns.</b> As to new products, mention is made to the latest in the market and to the different types of commercial polyester. Finally, polyester fibres have been placed, together with all the other fibres, In tables showing recent statistics. Market forecast for continuous yarn and discontinuous fibre are indicated...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a detailed study concerning {{the effects of}} chemicals like sodium hydroxide and environmental conditions such as temperature and time {{on the degradation of}} Poly lactic acid (PLA) as compared to Polyethylene terephthalate (PET). The aim is to study the effects of chemical and environmental conditions on the degradation of Poly lactic acids. In view of this, samples of PLA <b>flat</b> filament <b>yarns</b> and partially oriented PET yarns were hydrolysed with two different pH media i. e. neutral pH 7, and alkali pH 12. 0 - 13. 5 to study the physical changes that occurred in the yarn structure. Both the hydrolysed and non-hydrolysed yarns subjected to tensile test, DSC scans and FTIR analysis and the changes and the effects that took place before and after hydrolytic degradation at varied temperatures and times were analysed. The study showed that, at 60 o C and 90 o C hydrolysis yielded significant change in the physical appearance of the sample yarns as well as the structure. It could therefore be concluded that degradation highly occurred in the alkali medium than in the neutral medium when the time and temperatures were increased. This was also testified by the fact that elevated time and temperature aided in degrading the PLA <b>flat</b> filament <b>yarns</b> significantly than that of the partially oriented PET yarns...|$|R
40|$|Abstract––Mechanical crimp texturising {{technique}} is {{making use of}} differential migration behavior of the constituent filaments during their torsional deformation as well as bending deformation. Types of yarn, yarn fineness, filament fineness, shape factor etc. are the detrimental factors for these extents of deformations. Fully drawn continuous filament yarns with contrasting colours, apart from variation {{in one or more}} contributing factors mentioned above were grouped together for the desired production of fancy yarns. Structure of fancy yarn was analyzed by microscopical examination. The colour analysis of the product yarn was also done on Hunter lab colour measurement instrument Spectra Span 9100. This has permitted in identifying apparent colour of fancy yarn scientifically, which is different than its parent yarn colour. Favorable transformation of cheaper and stronger <b>flat</b> filament feeder <b>yarn</b> structure to favourable crimpy/bulky yarn structure was an added gain of this production process. All the samples were also shown good crimp associated properties. Thus newly designed fancy yarn produced out of <b>flat</b> filament <b>yarn</b> found to be a good option for value addition along with added comfort to apparel textiles as well as home furnishing...|$|R

Smooth it out so it is neither too loose nor too tight. Measure the number of wraps per inch (2.5 cm). For better accuracy, measure the wraps at the center of your yarn sample.|$|R
40|$|The textile {{industry}} in Europe {{is facing a}} new challenge {{in order to stay}} competitive into the textile market. They need to be flexible, cost efficient and produce with high quality. The setting of the machinery parameters is therefore an important aspect that combines implicit knowledge of workers and engineers with explicit knowledge. This makes it an ideal domain for CBR. It is used for an automatic parameter setting but the data cannot be reduced to a <b>flat</b> representation, as <b>yarns</b> and fabrics are multicomponent artefacts. Therefore we propose a combination of 4 algorithms to evaluate the similarity of the yarns. The application was successfully applied for spinning and it can be applied in the following steps of the textile processes like weavingPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R
40|$|This paper submits {{investigation}} on the tensile and bending {{properties of the}} flat braided thermosetting composites made using jute <b>yarns.</b> Combining <b>flat</b> braided jute <b>yarns</b> (untreated and coated) and vinylester resin, composite specimens were manufactured by hand lamination method. Tensile and 3 point bending tests were conducted. Test samples were polished and pre- and post-failure examinations were carried out using optical and scanning electron microscopy in order to analyze the test results and their relationships {{to the state of}} resin impregnation into the fibre bundles, fibre/matrix interfacial properties and the fracture and failure mechanisms. While tensile properties were slightly degraded due to coating treatments, bending properties of the composite showed improvement when coated yarns were used. These variations in the mechanical properties were broadly related to the state of resin impregnation into the fibre bundles and/or fibre/matrix interfacial interactions...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:-Mechanical crimp texturising {{method was}} {{developed}} with {{the virtue of}} imparting economy and versatility to the texturising process. Yarn produced by this technique has executed closer resemblance to preferable ring spun yarn structure as well as properties to <b>flat</b> multifilament <b>yarn.</b> Commercial success of this concept demands through study of impact of various raw materials, machine variables and process variables {{on the performance of}} this innovative yarn. This research work thereby designed to identify the influence of raw material variables on the mechanical crimp textured yarn performance. However, in order to avoid undue overlapping machine variables as well as process variables were kept constant. Empirically optimised values of these variables for polyester yarn have been adopted for this study. Fully drawn multifilament yarns belonging to two most commercially popular groups viz; Polyester and Nylon, were textured at three different false twist levels. These yarns were not only differing in terms of type of polymer group but also in terms of other contributing properties, viz; yarn fineness, filament fineness, cross sectional shape etc [...] However values of these variables were purely restricted by the availability of variations from the manufacturer end. Comparative evaluation of texturising as well mechanical properties of these product yarns have been done. All the samples irrespective of the material have shown the rise in the percent bulk, linear density, percent extension, percent boiling water shrinkage with finer trilobal cross section filament yarn. However, at identical yarn fineness, number of filaments (dpf) has played a detrimental role than modulus of polymeric yarn...|$|R
40|$|POY yarns {{are well}} know and commercialized since 1970 s. On the other hand, air-jet {{textured}} yarns are very common {{due to their}} unique structure which looks like natural spun-staple yarns. In the air-jet texturing process, the yarn is textured by overfeeding into a high-pressure of air to create a looped and more natural yarn appearance and also the bulkiness level of the yarn is controlled by input speed and jet-take out speed. This process reassigns <b>flat,</b> continous synthetic <b>yarns</b> into entangled, convoluted, bulky, spun like structured yarns. They are of higher bulk, exhibits increased covering power, have a more subdued lustre and are warmer in hand. Therefore, air-jet textured yarns possess some unique properties that require investigation. Hence, in this study, first the texturing process is introduced briefly and its principle of manufacturing is illustrated, later four different types of yarns were produced with two different fibre cross-sections at the three different nozzle types and three different core yarn feeding. The produced yarn production details are given and their breaking strength, elongation and work of rupture are studied along with their morphological structures by using light microscope and SEM. The {{aim of this study}} is to investigate the effect of POY fibre cross-section on air-jet textured yarn mechanical properties. The overall results showed that coarser air-jet textured yarns with a round shape have higher breaking strength, elongation and work of rupture than the trilobal shaped yarns. On the other hand, half matted yarn which was applied TiO 2 has also presented better breaking strength and elongation...|$|R
