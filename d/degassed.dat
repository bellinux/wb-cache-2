5|$|The {{composition}} of the lava domes suggests that they were formed by <b>degassed</b> magma {{left behind by the}} caldera-forming eruption. The pre-caldera lava domes were generated either directly from a common magma chamber or indirectly through secondary chambers. The lead isotope ratios are consistent with the volcano having formed at the edge of an area of granite and rhyolite of Paleozoic age. Incapillo magmas probably formed as adakitic high-pressure mafic magmas derived from the crust, either directly by anatexis or indirectly by dragged-down crustal fragments. The magmas are then modified by crustal contamination and fractional crystallization. As the subducting slab shallowed, crustal garnet-containing lherzolite and granulite-eclogite, contributed both from the crustal basis and forearc rocks that were dragged down by the subducting slab, became an increasingly important component of erupted magmas. Eventually, the Incapillo magma chamber was disconnected from the mantle and lower crust.|$|E

40|$|<b>Degassing</b> is very {{important}} for aluminum alloys especially for 7 xxx series alloys. In the present study, a high shear technology was used to <b>degas</b> 7032 aluminum alloy in order to study its <b>degassing</b> efficiency. The experimental results showed that the high shear technology can significantly <b>degas</b> 7032 aluminum alloy. By applying intensive melt shearing and an Ar injection of 60 seconds, the density index, Di, was reduced from 13. 25 % to 0. 28 % and the hydrogen concentration was significantly reduced from 0. 31 to 0. 10 mL/ 100 g Al. Compared with the conventional rotary <b>degassing,</b> high shear technology showed a much higher <b>degassing</b> efficiency, achieving a lower concentration of hydrogen in a shorter time. The water simulation experiment was used to study the mechanism of the high <b>degassing</b> efficiency. The small bubble size and the uniform distribution of Ar bubbles with the application of high shear technology are believed to be the main cause for the high <b>degassing</b> efficiency...|$|R

25|$|Because Callisto and Ganymede are {{structurally}} {{similar to}} Titan, {{it is unclear}} why their atmospheres are insignificant relative to Titan's. Nevertheless, the origin of Titan's N2 via geologically ancient photolysis of accreted and <b>degassed</b> NH3, as opposed to degassing of N2 from accretionary clathrates, {{may be the key}} to a correct inference. Had N2 been released from clathrates, 36Ar and 38Ar that are inert primordial isotopes of the Solar System should also be present in the atmosphere, but neither has been detected in significant quantities. The insignificant concentration of 36Ar and 38Ar also indicates that the ~40K temperature required to trap them and N2 in clathrates did not exist in the Saturnian subnebula. Instead, the temperature may have been higher than 75K, limiting even the accumulation of NH3 as hydrates. Temperatures would have been even higher in the Jovian subnebula due to the greater gravitational potential energy release, mass, and proximity to the Sun, greatly reducing the NH3 inventory accreted by Callisto and Ganymede. The resulting N2 atmospheres may have been too thin to survive the atmospheric erosion effects that Titan has withstood.|$|E
40|$|This work aims to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of ultrasonic <b>degassing</b> when applied to the AlSi 9 Cu 3 alloy when compared with other <b>degassing</b> techniques. The mechanism of aluminium <b>degassing</b> is discussed. A suitable ultrasonic <b>degassing</b> apparatus including a novel MMM (Multi-frequency Multimode Modulated) technology, able to supply up to 1. 2 kW power under a frequency up to 25 kHz, was developed specially for this purpose. Ultrasonic <b>degassing</b> is compared with rotary impeller <b>degassing</b> using argon and nitrogen as purging gases. Results characterization focuses the assessment of alloy density and final hydrogen content of the samples, using the Straube-Pffeifer method. Experimental results reveal that a constant value of density and hydrogen content can be reached after less than 2 minutes processing time, using ultrasonic energy, which is 3 times faster than rotary impeller <b>degassing.</b> Regardless of the processing time, final results (density and hydrogen concentration) achieved with ultrasonic <b>degassing</b> are much better than those reached using the gas purging technique...|$|R

30|$|The {{long-term}} stable <b>degassing</b> {{with a large}} {{emission rate}} is characteristic of persistent <b>degassing,</b> which is caused by conduit magma convection (Shinohara, 2008). Considering the large magma <b>degassing</b> rate, the conduit magma convection is the likely mechanism of the <b>degassing</b> at Shin-moedake after the lava effusion. The Shinmoedake volcanic gas composition, however, is quite S-poor compared with other persistently <b>degassing</b> volcanoes at subduction zones (Fig. 8). Melt inclusion analyses suggests that the H 2 O and S contents of the bulk magma are about 2 wt.% and 500 ppm (Saito et al., 2011), implying that the H 2 O/S mol ratio of the bulk magma is 70, {{which is similar to}} other persistently <b>degassing</b> volcanoes, such as the Satsuma-Iwojima and Miyakejima volcanoes (Saito et al., 2001, 2010). The S-poor volcanic gas composition of the Shinmoedake can be due to high-pressure <b>degassing.</b> Based on empirically estimated gas solubility, Giggenbach (1996) modeled the evolution of the gas composition with <b>degassing.</b> The model suggests that a shallow <b>degassing</b> results in a S-rich gas and the composition becomes S-poor with increasing pressure, then becomes also H 2 O-poor with further pressure increase (Fig. 8). This <b>degassing</b> trend qualitatively agrees with the results of recent experimental work by Lense et al. (2011) for basaltic magmas. This <b>degassing</b> trend suggests that the composition difference between the volcanic gases of the Shinmoedake and other persistently <b>degassing</b> volcanoes can be caused by higher pressure <b>degassing</b> at the Shinmoedake than at other volcanoes. The quantitative modeling of the gas composition evolution, however, is still not possible {{because of the lack of}} the experimental sulfur partitioning coefficient; in particular, with silicic magmas at low pressure ranges (Webster and Botcharnikov, 2011). The H 2 O-rich composition of the Shimoedake gases can also be due to the incorporation of meteoric water heated by the lavas in the crater.|$|R

Results show that the rotational speed has the greatest impact on the <b>degassing</b> of 4004 Al alloy, followed by gas flow and refining time; stewing time has the least impact. The optimum purification parameters obtained by current orthogonal analysis were: rotor speed of 500 r·min- 1, inert gas flow of 0. 4 mL·h- 1, refining time of 15 min, and stewing time of 6 min. <b>Degassing</b> rate using the optimum parameters reaches 68 %.

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{reports the}} results of batch and semibatch experiments involving bubbling of nitrogen in aqueous solutions of magnesium bicarbonate, with and without the addition of either carbonic anhydrase (CA) or Scenedesmus alga to the solution. Precipitation of nesquehonite occurred during both an accelerated <b>degassing</b> of CO 2 induced by sparging small nitrogen bubbles (representative diameter of 20 μm), and during slow <b>degassing</b> engendered by introducing large nitrogen bubbles (representative diameter of 5 mm). The response of the system during low rates of <b>degassing</b> closely approached quasi-thermodynamic predictions, which permitted an estimation {{of the level of}} supersaturation of nesquehonite, prior to the onset of precipitation. Small bubbles and CA significantly increased rates of <b>degassing</b> and indirectly the production of nesquehonite, as the rate of <b>degassing</b> can limit the precipitation process. The response of the system during rapid rates of <b>degassing,</b> prior to precipitation, was not entirely consistent with quasi-thermodynamic predictions. During precipitation, higher rates of <b>degassing</b> produced similar alkalisation and precipitation trends to that observed for lower rates of <b>degassing.</b> Our results agree with the formation of travertine deposits in nature, where the <b>degassing</b> of solutions enriched with inorganic carbon, and enhanced alkalisation by microorganisms, have been shown to influence carbonate formation. The results demonstrate a catalytic effect of CA on the rate limiting carbonate reactions, increasing CO 2 exchange between nitrogen and water, and indirectly accelerating the precipitation of carbonates for a system controlled by rate of <b>degassing.</b> The results of this study have applications to large-scale storage of CO 2 by mineralisation...|$|R
