40|$|This Article {{considers}} {{the allocation of}} power under the <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> law between the Attorney General along with the Department of Justice and the <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> whose appointment the Attorney General has triggered. Although the law explicitly transfers much of an Attorney General 2 ̆ 7 s lawful power to an <b>independent</b> <b>counsel,</b> it does {{not go far enough}} in reallocating that power. Thus, it leaves a fundamental gap between what the current statute purports <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> to be and what it actually empowers <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> to accomplish. After an introduction in Part I, Part II of this article reviews the current legal provisions, including the allocations to <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> of powers that ordinarily would belong to the Attorney General and the Department of Justice. Part III considers some instances in which the powers that the law or custom reserves to the Attorney General have been exercised to complicate or impede the work of <b>independent</b> <b>counsel.</b> Part IV proposes statutory modifications that would allocate further power to <b>independent</b> <b>counsel.</b> Part V considers some of the challenges that would arise and the political consequences that might flow from these proposed statutory modifications. I conclude in Part VI that an empowered <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> might have better working interactions with an Attorney General and the Department of Justice, facilitating quicker and more satisfying outcomes to <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> investigations. In the alternative, even if empowering <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> vis-a-vis the Attorney General would result in more visible and frequent political showdowns—between Attorneys General and <b>independent</b> <b>counsel</b> or between Presidents and independent counsel—this too could be healthy for our larger governmental processes...|$|R
