500|$|In 1990, Clarendon Press {{published}} <b>Gasper's</b> work The Dragon and the Dove: The Plays of Thomas Dekker. Writing in The Yearbook of English Studies, John Stachniewski of the University of Manchester {{described the}} book as [...] "trenchant and well-informed" [...] and expressed the view that he found <b>Gasper's</b> thesis [...] that Dekker's dramatic works subscribed to a militant Protestant ideology [...] to be [...] "convincing". John Harmon of Syracuse University reviewed <b>Gasper's</b> book for the English Studies journal, describing it as [...] "crisply researched" [...] and [...] "eminently readable" [...] although thought that she argued [...] "somewhat defensively" [...] that scholars should take Dekker's work more seriously. Reviewing the book for The Review of English Studies, T. H. Howard-Hill of the University of South Carolina noted that despite the work's title, it did not examine all of Dekker's 26 plays but only a selection of them. While noting that the work was [...] "thoroughly researched, well documented, and densely written", Hill also opined that it was [...] "disjointed, digressive, repetitive, and rambling" [...] and felt {{that it did not}} [...] "convincingly illustrate Decker's militant Protestant orientation" [...] in some of the plays that she had discussed.|$|R
500|$|Olivia Marks-Woldman, chief {{executive}} of the Holocaust Memorial Day Trust, criticised <b>Gasper's</b> claims as disappointing: [...] "Whilst it is important to recognise the differences between the ways the Nazis persecuted different groups, this shouldn't lead us to question the fact that thousands of gay men suffered appalling persecution because of their sexuality." ...|$|R

500|$|In April 2014, she {{declared}} there were {{far too many}} gay people in the Houses of Parliament, deeming this a [...] "violation of democracy". Claiming that only 1.5% {{of the population was}} gay, she stated this could justify no more than ten gay MPs, far less than the hundreds that she alleged existed. In the same post, she called for the gay networking and dating app Grindr to be banned as a threat to [...] "public health". Questioned by the BBC, the English Democrats' party spokesman Steve Uncles defended <b>Gasper's</b> [...] "personal opinion", which he claimed was based on a traditional, Christian understanding of sexuality, adding that she was [...] "factually correct" [...] in her claims regarding the number of homosexuals in Parliament. Conversely, her statistics were dismissed as [...] "absurd" [...] by the Oxford University Student Union's LGBT representative; they characterised <b>Gasper's</b> comments as representing evidence of the continuing existence of those with [...] "alarming prejudices" [...] who [...] "wish to actively discriminate against LGBTQ people".|$|R
500|$|Commenting in {{an article}} in Cherwell, Samuel Rutishauser-Mills {{questioned}} why the media bothered reporting on <b>Gasper's</b> anti-LGBT comments, noting that as a parish councillor her [...] "political significance is tenuous... and scarcely newsworthy or interesting." [...] He warned that excessive coverage of such opinions was counterproductive to the advancement of LGBT rights, by making [...] "extreme homophobia" [...] seem more commonplace than it really is.|$|R
25|$|Author Ichiei Ishibumi {{mentioned}} that Rias was {{developed into a}} second lead character and heroine, and Asia to be the second heroine, as well as Issei the protagonist, in the afterword of the first light novel. Some of his characters are loosely referenced from the Bible, non-fiction books, and mythology, and he created a world with a war being waged between three major factions (angels, devils, and fallen angels) with Rias being a devil. In Volume 5 of the light novels, Ishibumi writes that he likes to pair the main characters: Rias and Akeno are the big sister duo, Asia and Xenovia are the church-related duo who become friends, <b>Gasper</b> and Koneko are the young first-years, and Issei and Yuto are the guys.|$|E
500|$|The forum {{was shut}} down, <b>Gasper</b> {{resigned}} from her position {{as chairman of}} UKIP's Oxford branch, {{and a number of}} her supporters were also removed from the committee. A party spokesperson stated <b>Gasper</b> had stepped down [...] "to avoid doing herself or the party any more damage". <b>Gasper</b> insisted the withdrawal was her own decision, adding that she had been the victim of a [...] "press vendetta".|$|E
500|$|In January 2013, The Sunday Mirror {{revealed}} {{that in a}} UKIP members' online forum <b>Gasper</b> had condemned LGBT rights as a [...] "lunatic's charter", while claiming that some homosexuals prefer sex with animals over that with other humans, and reiterating her belief in a link between homosexuality and paedophilia. The newspaper characterised the comments as [...] "extremist and offensive" [...] and noted that the forum contained many homophobic and racist statements from UKIP members. When The Sunday Mirror asked for comment, <b>Gasper</b> stated that [...] "I'm {{not going to talk}} about them. It's none of your business." [...] Political commentator Nick Cohen, commenting in The Observer, described <b>Gasper</b> as an advocate of [...] "dumb prejudice".|$|E
5000|$|Air {{from the}} [...] "mix manifold" [...] is {{directed}} to overhead distribution nozzles [...] in the various [...] "zones" [...] of the aircraft. Temperature in each zone may be adjusted by adding small amounts of [...] "trim air", which is low-pressure, high-temperature air tapped off the aircraft pack upstream of the TCV. Air is also supplied to individual gaspers: small, circular vents above each passenger seat that can be adjusted by passengers for their personal comfort. A revolving control on the vent can be turned to adjust ventilation between no air output at all and a fairly substantial breeze.Gaspers usually receive their air from the air conditioning packs aboard the aircraft, which in turn receive compressed, clean air from the compressor stages of the aircraft's jet engines or when on the ground from the auxiliary power unit (APU) or a ground source. A master control for <b>gaspers</b> {{is located in the}} cockpit, and <b>gaspers</b> may be temporarily turned off during certain phases of flight, when the load on the engines from bleed-air demands must be minimized (e.g. take-off and climb).|$|R

The involvement of end users in the design process is indispensible for suitability, safety, and acceptance [24, 25]. Therefore, the aim of this study was to perform an evaluation of expert opinions regarding handle designs of currently used laparoscopic <b>gaspers</b> and to determine surgeons’ needs and expectations regarding haptic feedback instruments.|$|R

500|$|Later {{that month}} <b>Gasper</b> complained that readers of Pink News had {{threatened}} her, declaring {{that they should}} be forcibly institutionalised under the Mental Health Act. In doing so, she compared her situation to that of Salman Rushdie during The Satanic Verses controversy. She then claimed that she had received email death threats and was under police protection, assertions that local police refused to either confirm or deny. Commenting to Cherwell, she claimed her views on LGBT issues were [...] "very, very middle ground" [...] and that she had not said anything homophobic, but been the victim of [...] "a malicious witch hunt". Roweena Russell, former chair of the International Gay Lesbian Bisexual Transgender Youth and Student Organisation, emailed <b>Gasper</b> to discuss the latter's comments, to which <b>Gasper</b> responded that Russell too should be institutionalised. Russell proceeded to condemn <b>Gasper,</b> stating that [...] "as a long-term political activist I'm disgusted she used this kind of language. Using mental health as a slur {{on top of everything else}} she's doing is just unacceptable." [...] Rafe Jeune, chair of Oxford's Pride parade, characterised Gasper's comments as [...] "abhorrent" [...] and [...] "disgusting", noting that there was no evidence to link paedophilia and homosexuality.|$|E
500|$|In November 2013, <b>Gasper</b> was criticised for {{an essay}} {{entitled}} [...] "The Myth of the Homocaust", which she uploaded to her academia.edu account. It claimed that LGBT rights activists had fabricated {{the extent of}} the Nazi persecution of homosexuals.|$|E

Although describing the [...] "exciting" [...] work as an [...] "interesting exercise in historical biography", he noted that <b>Gasper</b> paints a [...] "hagiographic image" [...] of von Neuhoff, for instance by unconvincingly portraying him as a [...] "military genius" [...] and by falling into [...] "the trap of seeing things {{in black and white}} by frequently presenting Neuhoff and his followers as heroes ﬁghting against villains." ...|$|E
