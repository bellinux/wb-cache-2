5|$|A {{home run}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> {{in which the}} player reaches home plate, and scores a run on the same play without being called out. Most often in modern baseball, this occurs when a player hits the ball over the outfield wall in fair territory. However, it can occur on a ball hit to the outfield with a fast runner when the ball does not leave the field of play; this is called an inside-the-park home run. Home-run hitters are often likely to be larger, slower players due to their strength, {{and may not be}} fast enough to {{complete}} the triple. The MLB single-season and all-time leader in home runs is Barry Bonds, who hit 73 home runs in the 2001 season and notched 762 in his 22-season career. Bonds never hit for the cycle. The highest on the list to do so is Alex Rodriguez (fourth all-time; 696 home runs as of January 16, 2017), who hit for the cycle on June 5, 1997.|$|E

Angela accepts Pam's offer to merge the parties. Oscar enters the office with his partner Gil just as Angela is singing The Little Drummer Boy, pauses for a moment, says, [...] "Too soon" [...] and leaves.|$|E

Before the release the song was remixed by Sadkin at RAK Studios, in London. About the process Bailey commented: [...] "You know what a great producer is? It's someone who takes great ideas and makes them into good records. In our field, great music <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> record." [...] The song became the Thompson Twins' biggest hit in America, {{but at the same time}} it pressured the band to produce top-selling music, even if they were not completely comfortable with that, as Alannah Currie stated in an interview with David Oriard of The Spokesman-Review: ...|$|E

Queen said the {{collaboration}} with Wisin & Yandel came about from her work on their album, La Revolución (2009).

Reviewing the Telugu version, M.L.

Every song he composed <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> to this day." [...] S. Theodore Baskaran in his book The Eye of the Serpent noted, [...] "One factor that sustains the popularity of this film to this is the songs [...] ". On [...] "Intha Telisi", DakshinamurthyM. of The Hans India noted, [...] "The 'pallavi' and 'charanam' are in Kharaharapriya, second 'charanam' is in Ranjani {{and the last one}} is in Mohana. The switching from 'charanam' to 'pallavi' and vice versa is so smooth, one forgets to notice the change in 'ragam' and 'bhavam'." ...|$|E
500|$|In baseball, {{a triple}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> {{in which the}} batter {{advances}} to third base in one play, with neither {{the benefit of a}} fielding error nor another runner being put out on a fielder's choice. [...] Triples were more common in baseball's dead-ball era, when teams relied more on stolen bases and hit and run plays than on the home run. [...] More distant fences in old ballparks, such as Pittsburgh's Forbes Field and Detroit's Tiger Stadium, also produced fewer home runs and more triples on well-hit balls. As a result, most of the players on this list have been retired for decades. In 2006, the Hardball Times lamented the decline of the 100-triple player, although three have joined the list since that time. Fangraphs, a statistical website, likewise noted the lack of modern 100-triple hitters in 2013. Of the 162 Major League Baseball players who have hit 100 or more triples, 69 are members of Baseball's Hall of Fame.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Krusty the Clown Prison Special" [...] {{is based}} on Johnny Cash's 1968 {{appearance}} at Folsom Prison. Krusty's song is a parody of [...] "Folsom Prison Blues". The mention of Arthur Fiedler's wake is an apparent reference and parody of Frasier Crane's upper class Seattle lifestyle. The episode contains several references to Frasier, {{with the intention of}} making it obvious that The Simpsons was parodying the series. These include a title card just {{before the start of the}} second act which says [...] "Frasier <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit</b> show on the NBC television network" [...] in a similar typeface and style as Frasiers intertitles, with jazz music playing over it as it does in the series. [...] When Bart jumps on Cecil and says [...] "guess who," [...] Cecil replies with [...] "Maris?" [...] Cecil's inability to see Bart also refers to the fact that Maris, Niles' wife in Frasier, is never actually seen.|$|E
500|$|Thomas Conner {{from the}} Chicago Sun-Times neither praised nor criticized the song, but instead {{focused on the}} steamy nature of the composition. [...] " [...] and panting duet partner Drake steam the {{recording}} studio windows as he raps a helpless play-by-play". Bill Lamb from About.com gave the song a positive review, saying that [...] "There it is, the chorus opens the track with [...] "Oh na na...what's my name?" [...] and the hook is firmly implanted. It's not long before Drake's added on rap kicks in with clever, sexy and romantic rhyming. Then the dreamy drum machine rhythms and Rihanna's vocals kick in again. This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit...</b> "What's My Name?" [...] is a good addition to that romantic evening playlist." [...] Jocelyn Vena from MTV praised the [...] "song's chorus" [...] and [...] "Drake's verse". Molly Lambert of Pitchfork Media praised Rihanna's performance saying that [...] "On 'What's My Name', Rihanna doesn't have {{to tell us how}} desirable she is – it is a given.

While ABC News writer, Steve Jones, described how [...] "Bye Bye" [...] packed the bum with [...] "an emotional wallop", The Washington Posts Freedom De Luc compared it heavily to [...] "Don't Forget About Us", Carey's 2005 single. De Luc wrote how both shared similar piano instrumentation, however different lyrical settings; [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] finds Carey playing a [...] "broken-hearted lover", while [...] "Bye Bye" [...] an [...] "inspirational song that comes with {{its own set of}} suggested demographics and instructions." [...] Some reviewers felt the song was a sub-par effort from an artist of Carey's stature, with many describing it as unoriginal and not a good follow-up single to [...] "Touch My Body". Entertainment Weeklys Margeaux Watsman felt [...] "Bye Bye" [...] was an [...] "odd choice" [...] for a second single, and called it [...] "somber edgy". Nick Levine from Digital Spy described the track as a [...] "shmaltzy ballad", while an anonymous VH1 critic wrote [...] "with the “We Belong Together” sonic template and lyrics tailored appeal to everyone on such a basic level seems like too easy of a combination for someone as established as Mimi. This one’s like insurance – in case nothing else <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>hit,</b> here’s a sure-shot. But ultimately, {{it turns out that the}} album is too good for that." ...|$|E

She noted that the album is rich on [...] "summary riffs and brisk tempos", before summarising, [...] "by refusing to settle for [...] "good enough" [...] – and by creating a homage to youthful, timeless pop punk – New Found Glory sound revitalised and relevant." [...] AbsolutePunk staff writer Thomas Nassiff described the album as containing [...] "beautiful pop-punk jammers" [...] while awarding a score of 8 out of 10. Though {{pointing out that the}} album offers nothing new to the band's catalog, he reflected [...] "New Found Glory has too many good records to call this one their best, but that doesn't really matter in the end. Comparing Radiosurgery to Sticks and Stones, New Found Glory or even Catalyst or Not Without a Fight is simply irrelevant. It's better to concentrate on what's in front of us: a hard-hitting, purely enjoyable album from South Florida's proudest sons." [...] David McLaughlin of Kerrang! magazine expressed that [...] "Radiosurgery is pretty much everything anyone could want from a New Found Glory record." [...] Awarding an [...] "excellent" [...] four K! rating, he noted the album's [...] "nostalgic 90s sound" [...] by adding, [...] "Age-old tales about lovestruck boys and girls told in three minutes via three chords, killer choruses and golden melodies. The Ramones knew {{a thing or two about}} that. So do New Found Glory. These tried and tested musical staples still make for some really special moments." [...] Tom Williams of Big Cheese magazine awarded the album five stars out of five in his review.

[...] Gregory Heaney of Allmusic awarded the album a favorable three and a half stars out of five in his review. He noted how [...] "pop-punk is becoming a lost art, a rarefied ability to sugarcoat heartache rather than embellish it, and that's exactly what New Found Glory do on this album. Without falling back on breakdowns, half-time choruses, or screaming, the band delivers 11 tracks of upbeat rock ruminations on unrequited love and heartbreak." ...|$|E
