Noggings may be made of timber, steel, or aluminium. If made of timber they are cut slightly longer than the space they fit into, and are driven into place so they fit tightly or are rebated into the wall stud.|$|E
5000|$|The {{same can}} not be said of the Flood of 1936. The failure of a major ice jam sent large ice blocks downriver, {{striking}} both ends of the upstream side of the bridge. This left the structure leaning upstream. Only the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bracing</b> prevented collapse. [...] The decision was made to fix, rather than demolish, the bridge. This required efforts similar to the initial construction. [...] The results were that the truss span was shortened by 54 ft during the procedure in November and December 1936. This was performed by the American Bridge Company (Philadelphia), at a cost of US$120,000 (US$ in present terms), substantially less than would have been required to replace the bridge.|$|E
50|$|The Spit Bridge over Middle Harbour can be {{described}} as a steel and concrete girder bridge with a bascule lift span. The Spit Bridge comprises 7 spans of a total length of 745 ft, has four traffic lanes with a width of 44 ft and a pedestrian walkway of 5 ft on either side. There are three spans {{at either end of the}} opening span. Each of the six fixed spans have four welded plate girders as the main members, with cross girders, but without stringers or <b>horizontal</b> <b>bracing.</b> The concrete deck is dowelled to the steelwork. The opening span (Span 4) is a single-leaf bascule. It has two main girders, with cross girders and stringers, covered by an open mesh steel deck.|$|E
50|$|The channel-iron <b>horizontal</b> <b>braces</b> did not butt {{up against}} the column body; correct {{separation}} was dependent on bolts being tightly nipped up (previous comments {{about the lack of}} facing applied here also). Because holes in lugs were cast not drilled, their position was more approximate, and some <b>horizontal</b> <b>braces</b> had been site-fitted, leaving burrs up to 3/16th inch.|$|R

5000|$|In {{tandem with}} the bundled tube system, the {{structure}} will also employ shear walls to stabilize the tower's slender multi-level [...] "tubes." [...] The bundled tube structure alone provides vertical strength - that is to say, the bundled tubes act as columns, carrying large loads of weight straight down, but are unable to resist lateral loads. The shear walls act as <b>horizontal</b> <b>bracing,</b> with effects {{similar to those of}} William LeBaron Jenney's cross bracing or X-bracing that allowed for the first skyscrapers to be constructed in Chicago. The walls tie into the central core of the tower. As lateralload is applied to the building (such as wind, snow and rain), the shear walls resist the load and transfer it deeper into the building to the core. The core then carries the load down to the bedrock at the foundation.|$|E
50|$|Panelled timber {{doors with}} fretwork fanlights are {{opposite}} {{each other at}} the back of the hall. They each lead into large rooms, formerly the wards of the sanatorium, now subdivided into four small rooms. These rooms do not have full height partitions and the space of the wards is discernible. The raked ceiling is lined with tongue-and-groove with two <b>horizontal</b> <b>bracing</b> members running across the room at the same level as the top of the walls. Light fittings and switches are suspended from these members. The northern face of the ceiling has a centrally located, timber framed, fixed glass skylight whilst on the western and eastern walls respectively, there are small corrugated fibreglass panels that also let in light. A section of rendered brick provides evidence of the chimney once located in the eastern ward. The chimney remains in the western ward, however, it has been blocked up and there is no fireplace. Evidence of windows is visible along the northern walls of both wards.|$|E
50|$|The {{residence}} at 98 Mt Crosby Road has a short-ridge pyramid roof and is sheeted in corrugated iron. The front verandah has been removed. A section of side verandah {{on the southern}} {{side of the house}} remains with its iron lace balustrade, its posts, brackets and capitals, and an acroterian remains on at least one corner of the roof guttering. The iron lace is similar to or identical with that of the earlier house, Oaklands, at 100 Mt Crosby Road, and the brackets are similar or identical with those on the later house, Wrightson, at 106 Mt Crosby Road. Walls facing the former front verandah are single-skin, vertically-jointed boards with <b>horizontal</b> <b>bracing.</b> Under the main roof are 5 bedrooms, a sleepout, study, formal lounge with marble and tiled fireplace, dining room, living room, and a kitchen. A small hip-roof structure at the right of the house is sheeted in corrugated iron and may originally have functioned as a service wing or business office.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the project, engineers had to figure out the safest way to build the tunnel without endangering the existing elevated highway above.

50|$|Brace posts {{are placed}} in-line about 8 ft {{from the corner}} post. A <b>horizontal</b> {{compression}} <b>brace</b> connects {{the top of the}} two posts, and a diagonal wire connects the top of the brace post {{to the bottom of the}} corner post.

A second set of brace posts (forming a double brace) is used whenever the barbed wire span exceeds 200 ft.|$|R
50|$|Building length: 3 m (10' +/-) to 10 m (32' +/-) is common. Length is {{primarily}} {{limited by the}} ability of the load path to transfer loads to a vertical brace system (e.g. gable endwall).

5000|$|On the Tay Bridge the {{diagonal}} bracing was {{by means of}} flat bars running from one lug at the column section top (an {{integral part of the}} column casting) to two sling plates bolted to {{the diagonal}}ly opposite lug. Bar and sling plates all had a matching longitudinal slot in them; the tie bar was placed between the sling plates with all three slots aligned and overlapping and a gib driven through all three slots and secured. Two cotters (metal wedges) were then positioned to fill the rest of the slot overlap, and driven in hard to put the tie under tension. <b>Horizontal</b> <b>bracing</b> was provided by (wrought iron) channel iron. The various bolt heads were too close to each other, and to the column for easy tightening up with spanners; this coupled with lack of precision in the preparation of the channel iron braces led to various on site fitting expedients (one of them described by a witness to the enquiry as [...] "about as slovenly a piece of work as ever I saw in my life").) ...|$|E
50|$|Batak Toba culture centres on Lake Toba and {{the sacred}} island of Samosir that lies within it. Jabu is the Toba {{language}} word for rumah adat. The houses {{are made up}} of three sections. A substructure of large wooden pillars resting on flat stones (or concrete nowadays) protects the structure from rising damp. Some of these pillars support longitudinal beams known as labe-labe, which run the length of the house at head height to carry the massive roof. Other pillars carry two large beams with carved singa heads which, with two lateral beams mortised into them, form a great ring beam bearing the small living area. The substructure is strengthened by beams mortised into the piles which double as night stalls for cattle. Walls are lightweight and lean outwards and provide additional stability to the structure. The wall and the wall plate supporting the rafters hang from the labe-labe with rattan cord, while the base of the wall sits on the ring beam. The rafters spring from the wall plate and are angled outwards producing the roof curve. In lieu of <b>horizontal</b> <b>bracing</b> battens, diagonal ties - running {{from the middle of the}} labe-labe to the gable ends - provide reinforcement.|$|E
5000|$|On the Crumlin and Belah Viaducts, however, <b>horizontal</b> <b>bracing</b> was {{provided}} by substantial fitted cast-iron girders securely attached to the columns, with the diagonal braces then being attached to the girders. [...] The Chairman of the Court of Inquiry quoted at length from a contemporary book praising the detailed engineering of the Belah viaduct piers (and describing the viaduct {{as one of the}} lightest and cheapest of the kind that had ever been erected)....It is a distinguishing feature in this viaduct that the cross, or distance girders of the piers encircle the columns, which are turned up at that point, the girders being bored out to fit the turned part with great accuracy. No cement of any kind was used in the whole structure, and the piers when completed, and the vertical and horizontal wrough-iron bracings keyed up, are nearly as rigid as though they were one solid piece...... The fitting was all done by machines, which were specially designed for the purpose, and finished the work with mathematical accuracy The flanges of the column were all faced up and their edges turned, and every column was stepped into the one below it with a lip of about 5/8 of an inch in depth, the lip and socket for it being actually turned and bored. That portion of the column against which the cross girders rested was also turned. The whole of these operations were performed at one time, the column being centred in a hollow mandril-lathe. After being turned the columns passed on to a drilling machine, in which all the holes in each flange were drilled out of the solid simultaneously. And as this was done with them all in the same machine, the holes of course, perfectly coincided when the columns were placed one on the other in the progress of erection. Similar care was taken with the cross-girders, which were bored out at the ends by machines designed for that purpose. Thus, when the pieces of the viaduct had to be put together at the place of erection there was literally not a tool required, and neither chipping or filing to retard the progress of the work.Either, said the Chairman, the Belah viaduct had been over-engineered, or the Tay Bridge had been under engineered.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{investigate}} the different mechanical behavior of column-bracing system between fixed-ended and pin-ended column base, {{a large number of}} column-bracing systems with fixed-ended and pin-ended column base were studied using the ANSYS program, in which random combination of the initial imperfections between columns and braces was well considered by the Monte Carlo method. Based on the above comparative study, probability density function of the bracing force was found through probability statistics and the design bracing force is obtained. The results show that the ultimate load-carrying capacity and the bracing forces of the mid-height <b>horizontal</b> <b>braces</b> of column-bracing systems with pin-ended column base are higher than that of column-bracing systems with fixed-ended column base, and the higher ultimate load-carrying capacity of the former more significantly increases the bracing forces of the mid-height horizontal braces; that the bracing forces of the mid-height <b>horizontal</b> <b>braces</b> in compression or in tension have also randomness because of the randomness of the initial imperfection of both columns and braces...|$|R

40|$|A steel construction, {{divided into}} two parts, was {{designed}} for the building object of a production block of a bio power plant. The two parts separate the boiler room and the engine room. Due to the specific load caused by the operation equipment, also several plateaus, consoles, footbridges and technological constructions were designed. A system of principal pillars HEB, transversely frame-connected with plane solid girders IPE, forms the hall construction. Pillars in rows 1 and 4 are rigidly jointed to foundations. A bearing structure of the roof deck is imposed on the girders. It is composed {{of a system of}} purlins – rolled profiles type UPE. The rigidity of the roof is secured by <b>horizontal</b> <b>bracing</b> between the purlins. The construction of the boiler room is attached to the construction of the engine room, which is formed of frame-connected principal pillars HEB in rows 4, 7 and 8. The roof truss IPE is designed for 12 900 mm span between rows 4 and 7 and for 4 800 mm between rows 7 and 8. The spatial rigidity of the structure is not only secured by the rigid connection of pillars and foundation combined with the frame-connected roof rungs. It is mainly maintained thanks to the system of vertical wall bracings interacting with the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bracing</b> of the roof. Between the pillar rows B, C, D, E, F and G and 8 to 9 a construction of a substation is attached. In the engine room is situated technological structure. The construction is formed by supporting frames consisting of pillars type HEA, rungs type IPE and HEA and vertical bracing of rolled profiles.

The rigidity of the structure is secured both ways by vertical bracing and by the connection of the plateau beams with the hall girders...|$|E
50|$|Entrance {{into the}} prison {{building}} {{is through a}} pair of doors located {{in the center of}} the front wall. The outer of the two might possibly be a replacement; the inner one, with vertical beaded boards and <b>horizontal</b> <b>braces,</b> appears to be a product of the eighteenth century. The door is flanked by two small square windows, both unglazed; the southern one is only a conjectural restoration, based on the surviving northern window. The remains of three vertical iron bars were found in this opening, and they have served as a pattern for some of the restoration work. There is a small opening in the back wall of the jail that appears to have been used as a latrine slot.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Due to the {{frequent}} occurrence of earthquakes sudden failure of structures leads to maximum loss of lives and property. Multistoryed buildings are affected severely {{since they are}} more susceptible to damage during earthquakes. Due to the large lateral displacements, both structural and non structural distress and damages are observed in reinforced concrete frames. The current codal provisions emphasis lateral forces rather than lateral displacements. The maximum lateral displacements are checked {{at the end of the}} design process to satisfy serviceability requirements. In recent times a growing interest in performance based design procedures in which lateral displacements are emphasized than lateral forces. From the lessons learnt due to past earthquakes is it observed that large numbers of multistoryed buildings are severely affected. This leads to increased awareness in the analysis of multistoreyed buildings. In this study seismic analysis of five stoyred reinforced cement concrete frames is carried with and without the <b>horizontal</b> <b>bracing</b> element at substructure level. The analysis is carried out using standard software package. The results are compared to study the earthquake resistant behaviour of the multistoryed building frame systems with and without horizontal brace elements...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{concerns the}} analysis of structural behaviour of some historic-monumental buildings in which steel structures are used for the seismic protection. A dynamic model {{has been made to}} individuate the macro-element with an high seismic risk, that is, for church studied, the drum-dome system. Then a scaled model has been tested to determinate the evolution of the lesions, the retrofitting works, that are constituted by steel frames, bare or braced, inserted inside door/window holes of the drum-dome system, and the variation structural ductility. An elastic linear analysis, with a FEM software, has been developed for other type of buildings, in which the vertical structures are made with squared blocks of calcarenite connected by mortar. These buildings have the plan of rectangular shapes and are characterized by flexible floors. A suitable upgrading technique consists in using <b>horizontal</b> <b>braced</b> steel frames connected to the walls in order to prevent local mechanisms and to limit the interstorey drift values...|$|R
50|$|The tunnel is {{constructed}} {{of a series}} of two to eight rings, usually eight to ten feet in diameter to allow headroom for the people using the tunnel. The vertical rings are connected to <b>horizontal</b> <b>braces</b> forming a cylinder similar in shape to a large coffee can with the ends removed. The interior of the spinning tunnel is lined with fabric or plastic sheeting with secured to the rings and braces in whatever manner is expedient to the builder or designer of the tunnel. Velcro straps, duct tape, and staples are used in different constructions. The liner can be printed or decorated with images or abstract designs that draw the eye and further the optical illusion fostered by the rotating liner. The use of flourescent inks or paint and black lighting can add to the enjoyment of the attraction by creating a spooky, darkly lit environment. Music or other sound effects help to mask the sound of the rotating tunnel and the operation of the drive motor.|$|R
50|$|The longer span, (136 ft) {{uses the}} same {{materials}} but is more intricate. It has nine panels, each 15 ft wide, creating chords which arch both {{above and below the}} deck {{to the point that they}} are 22 ft apart at their most distant from each other, in mid-span. The upper chord is made of flanged plate girders riveted together with top and bottom iron cap plates bolted on; the lower of double 1+1/4 by 3 in wrought iron bars. Both are joined at the span's end with end pins. A lattice-braced system similar to that on the short span supports the lenticular truss, with similar members serving as <b>horizontal</b> <b>braces</b> below the deck. Iron tie rods 1+1/4 in wide serve as diagonal cross-braces on the panels, and there is a horizontal tension rod at each end of the truss. A set of expansion rollers at the west end, intended to provide additional stability, has since corroded due to road salt and rust.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the influence}} of <b>horizontal</b> <b>bracing</b> restraints provided by the friction between pallet bases and rail beams on the static behaviour and design of steel drive-in storage racks. The pallet bracing restraints are shown to significantly influence the structural behaviour of the rack, and their effect on the bending moment distribution of the uprights is studied in the paper. The 2 D single upright model proposed by Godley is improved in this study by including the restraints provided by the plan flexural stiffness of the rail beams and the friction between the pallets and rail beams. The improved 2 D model was found to accurately reproduce the bending moment distributions obtained using 3 D advanced finite element analysis. The 2 D single upright model is used to analyse 36 drive-in racks under various load case combinations. The paper evaluates {{the influence of}} the pallet bracing restraints on the ultimate capacity of drive-in racks, clarifies the loading pattern(s) governing the structural design and determines the friction coefficient, or strength of a restraining device, required to prevent the pallets from sliding. It is shown that while restraints from pallets could potentially be considered in design, they would not lead to more economic structural solutions.

A shell element was used to model the steel web, bottom flange, and end-diaphragms. A three-dimensional beam element was adopted to model the top flanges, cross-bracings, and top chords. An extensive parametric study, using the finite-element modelling, was conducted, in which 15 non-composite single-cell bridge prototypes were analyzed to evaluate their load distribution factors for moment, reaction, axial force and deflection under dead load conditions. The span length of prototype bridges ranged from 20 to 100 meters. The width of the cell was taken as 3. 0, 3. 8, and 4. 65 meters. The span-to-radius of curvature ratio was taken as 0, 0. 4, 1. 0, 1. 4, and 2. 0 for selected prototype bridges.

40|$|As {{the worlds}} demand for energy is {{increasing}} mostly {{due to the}} increase in population, and coal, oil and gas deposits are limited, it is desirable to gather energy from renewable energy sources. Wind energy is a form of renewable energy. Wind turbines have been common on land and near shores for some time, but now one wants {{to take advantage of the}} wind resources further away from the coast. As the length from the coast increases, so does the water depth making it necessary to use other foundations than the well-known monopile. In this thesis the &# 147;Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency&# 148; in Germany, also known as Bundesamt f&# 252;r Schifffarth und Hydrographie requires in the standard &# 147;Design of Offshore Wind Turbines&# 148; that an offshore wind turbine needs to be risk evaluated against a ship tanker of more than 500 MJ in collision energy in order to be classified as collision energy. This is to prevent environmental pollution in form of oil spill. Whether the offshore wind turbine models used in this thesis are collision friendly or not relies on different factors. When the given soil properties are used the analyses show in all cases except one that the offshore wind turbine models can be called collision friendly. The case were it could not be called collision friendly was a case with the small jacket at a water depth of 27 m getting hit by a loaded ship at a column of the jacket, but installing a <b>horizontal</b> <b>brace</b> on this jacket would make it also collision friendly. The effects of soil, water depth and a horizontal x-brace are looked further into in this thesis. If the soil had been stronger it is not certain that the outcome would be the same. When the jackets were fixed to the sea bed, several of the models could collapse in the dangerous direction over the ship. A <b>horizontal</b> <b>brace</b> was seen to have a positive effect when installed on the different jacket models. It seems also that it is more favorable to use jackets at deeper water. </p...|$|R
