40|$|We {{analyze the}} effects of Geographical Indication (GI) {{labeling}} on quality choices and welfare with two vertically differentiated goods, one labelable, the other not. We consider two attributes of these goods: <b>gustatory</b> <b>quality</b> and geographical origin. We investigate two extreme cases of the Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) label: a denomination standard, which guarantees only {{the origin of the}} product, without any requirement on production specifications; and a minimum quality requirement, which guarantees both the origin {{and the quality of the}} product. We find that the PDO good is not necessarily the high-quality good. When it is, the introduction of the denomination standard causes its quality to decrease. Binding production specifications that maintain the quality level of the labeled good adversely affect the PDO firm. ...|$|E

As sensory quality is a great expectation from organic consumer, breeding strategy will integrate sensory criteria. In order to create new type populations, a large germplasm of broccoli have been first screened for their agronomical performance and their sensory quality. On these results, a minimum number of common traits required have been proposed on the agronomical, <b>gustatory</b> <b>qualities</b> and more secondary on appearance traits.

40|$|Milk {{and dairy}} {{products}} {{are one of the}} most prevalent and broadly consumed foodstuffs. Ice-cream occupies an important place in a wide range of dairy products. The goal of the paper. To analyze the technological process of ice-cream production in the one of the most advanced enterprise UAB Vikeda. To examine the influence of biologically valuable additives on the technological process of the ice-cream production and quality. Novelty of the paper. Samples of ice-cream have been produced under laboratory conditions of the Technology Laboratory at Lithuanian Food Institute using the following additives: wheat fiber gel Vitacel, acacia gum fiber Fibergum, lupine proteins Lupine protein and Omega-fatty acids. Physical and sensual qualities of the ice-cream have been examined. Methods of research. Research has been performed in UAB Vikeda located in Kedainiai and in Lithuanian Food Institute. The following qualities of ice-cream have been analyzed: melting of ice-cream; hardness of ice-cream; sensual evaluation of ice-cream; research of consumers. The melting of ice-cream samples has been determined in accordance with the methods presented by Lithuanian Food Institute. Instrumental research of the hardness of the ice-cream texture has been performed using the semi-automatic penetrometer Labor. Sensual qualities of ice-cream have been evaluated in accordance with the „Methods on Sensual Evaluation of Milk and Dairy Products Sensual Analysis“, worked out by Lithuanian Food Institute. Conslusions: 1) The usage of Vitacel (0. 8 - 1. 2 %) adds to the product no negative <b>gustatory</b> <b>qualities.</b> It allows supposing that the chosen concentrations of Vitacel may be used in the production of ice-cream and concentration of the mentioned amount has no negative influence on sensual quality of ice-cream. 2) After adding Fibergum (1 - 1. 5 %) ice-cream has become harder and melted more slowly. The additive used has influenced freezing sense, however, it has not provided the product with negative <b>gustatory</b> <b>qualities.</b> Therefore, the additive may be used in the production of ice-cream. 3) The additive of lupine proteins (1 - 2 %) has influenced both <b>gustatory</b> and texture <b>qualities.</b> It allows supposing that the chosen concentrations of lupine proteins should not be used in the production of ice-cream. 4) The additive of Omega- 3 fatty acids (0. 2 - 0. 3 %) has demonstrated no influence on the production process and the quality of ice-cream and may be used in production of ice-cream...|$|R
40|$|Are {{geographical}} indications a worthy quality signal? A framework with endogenous quality choice The paper provides {{a theoretical framework}} to analyze the effects of Protected Designation of Origin (PDO) labeling on quality choices and welfare. Our model distinguishes two attributes of goods: <b>gustatory</b> <b>quality,</b> which is a search attribute, and geographical origin, which is a credence attribute. We compare equilibria with no label, “non-binding labeling ” (i. e. when no requirement on production methods is binding to get the PDO label) and “binding labeling”. We find that the PDO good {{is not necessarily the}} high-quality good. When it is, the introduction of non-binding labeling causes a decrease in quality. Restrictions on production methods are warranted to maintain the quality level of the labelable good, but they adversely affect the PDO firm. 1...|$|E

40|$|International audienceSensory {{evaluation}} plays a {{key role}} in characterizing different cultivars. The eating quality of new European Pyrus communis cultivars with those of traditional cultivars were compared. Fruits were tasted by a trained panel after cold storage followed by ripening to a firmness of about 1. 5 kg. Harrow Delicious and Williams cultivars were compared and found to have similar eating quality, but Williams had a higher rating for the coarseness criterion. Elliot, a bronze cultivar, was characterized by high astringency, but was otherwise comparable to Conference. Winter Forelle was a remarkably stable cultivar with a characteristic high crunchiness rating, but its other sensory criteria received lower ratings. In the category represented by Doyenné du Comice, Taylor's Gold (a bronze cultivar) was characterized by strong <b>gustatory</b> <b>qualities</b> and marked astringency. Angélys had eating quality very similar to those of Doyenné du Comice. Verdi had more marked astringency and high acidity characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Context The hypogeous sporophores {{of several}} Tuber species, renowned for their {{aromatic}} and <b>gustatory</b> <b>qualities,</b> are widely commercialized. One {{of the most}} valuable species is Tuber melanosporum Vittad., the P,rigord black truffle also known as "the black diamond". However, many aspects of T. melanosporum life cycle remain unsolved. Aims In this work, we examine past and recent findings on the life cycle of T. melanosporum, currently regarded as a model system for Tuber species, with the view of highlighting aspects of its life cycle which remain unsolved. Results Several aspects of its life cycle have recently been elucidated (i. e. characterization of two mating type genes, heterothallism, prevalence of sexual reproduction on vegetative propagation, exclusion of one mating type by its opposite on ectomycorrhizas, dependency of ascocarps on their host for carbon allocation), while others remain unaddressed. Conclusion Numerous additional aspects of the T. melanosporum life cycle remain unsolved, such as exclusion or competition mechanisms between ectomycorrhizal mating types, factors involved in ascocarp initiation, the nature of the connection linking ascocarps and mycorrhizas and atmospheric nitrogen fixation...|$|R
40|$|It was {{recently}} shown {{that in some}} subjects capsaicin can evoke bitterness as well as burning and stinging, particularly in the circumvallate (CV) region of the tongue. Because perception of bitterness from capsaicin is characterized by large individual differences, the main goal {{of the present study}} was to learn whether people who taste capsaicin as bitter also report bitterness from structurally similar sensory irritants that are known to stimulate capsaicin-sensitive neurons. The irritancy and taste of capsaicin and two of its most commonly studied congeners, piperine and zingerone, were measured in individuals who had been screened for visibility of, and reliable access to, the CV papillae. Approximately half of these individuals reported tasting bitterness from all three irritants when the stimuli were swabbed directly onto the CV papillae. Concentrations that produced similar levels of burning sensation across subjects also produced similar (though lower) levels of bitter taste. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that capsaicin and its congeners stimulate bitterness via a common sensory receptor that is distributed differentially among individuals. Additionally, bitter tasters rated <b>gustatory</b> <b>qualities</b> (but not burning and stinging) slightly but significantly higher than did bitter non-tasters, which suggests that perception of capsaicin bitterness is associated with a higher overall taste responsiveness (but not chemesthetic responsiveness) in the CV region...|$|R
40|$|Coding of {{gustatory}} {{information is}} complex and unique among sensory systems; information is received by multiple receptor populations located throughout the oral cavity and carried to a single central relay by four separate nerves. The geniculate ganglion is {{the location of the}} somata of two of these nerves, the greater superficial petrosal (GSP) and the chorda tympani (CT). The GSP innervates taste buds on the palate and the CT innervates taste buds on the anterior tongue. To obtain requisite taste response profiles of GSP neurones, we recorded neurophysiological responses to taste stimuli of individual geniculate ganglion neurones in vivo in the rat and compared them to those from the CT. GSP neurones had a distinct pattern of responding compared to CT neurones. For example, a small subset of GSP neurones had high response frequencies to sucrose stimulation, whereas no CT neurones had high response frequencies to sucrose. In contrast, NaCl elicited high response frequencies in a small subset of CT neurones and elicited moderate response frequencies in a relatively large proportion of GSP neurones. The robust whole-nerve response to sucrose in the GSP may be attributable to relatively few, narrowly tuned neurones, whereas the response to NaCl in the GSP may relate to proportionately more, widely tuned neurones. These results demonstrate the diversity in the initial stages of sensory coding for two separate gustatory nerves involved in the ingestion or rejection of taste solutions, and may have implications for central coding of <b>gustatory</b> <b>quality</b> and concentration as well as coding of information used in controlling energy, fluid and electrolyte homeostasis...|$|E
40|$|Gustatory {{differentiation}} is {{one possible}} means of segmentation. Consumer preferences of carrot were studied {{within the framework}} of the CosiVeg project. The characteristics of batches offered for consumer assessment enables their preferences to be evaluated. In preparation for a hedonic test of raw grated carrots that was carried out in autumn 2011, the carrot sensory space was studied in 2010 using 48 batches that were evaluated using quantative descriptive sensory analysis. The cultivars were representative of different types, Nantais, Imperator, Flakkee, coloured carrots and genetic resources.. Significant differences were observed for all criteria, allowing varieties to be grouped based on their sensory characteristics. Texture, flavor and aroma contribute to the “identity” of carrots. Overall aroma is correlated with perceptions of bitterness, sharpness and chemical aroma. Fourteen orange carrot varieties were selected for sowing in 2011. In 2010, although maximum scores were obtained for pungent and bitter attributes, this was not the case in 2011. In spite of this, the selected batches allowed the different profiles of the sensory characteristics of the carrots to be determined. Ten batches of carrot that represented a wide range of variability were tasted by a trained panel as well as a consumer panel; the product was presented as raw grated carrot. The sensory measurements obtained were used to map preferences, underlining preferences for a carrot that is juicy, aromatic and sweet. However bitter and chemical flavour carrots were not appreciated. Three types of consumer exist each having different expectations in terms of quality. Almost 20 % of people questioned are looking for a high quality product, for 33 % of consumers carrots are a staple food and they have no specific expectations and 48 % are satisfied with the current product but are potentially interested by a product that would distinguish itself as regards to quality.

40|$|A process-based model {{simulating}} {{the change}} in total soluble solids (TSS (%)) in fruit flesh was developed to describe the effect of climatic conditions on the sugar content of 'Queen Victoria' pineapple at harvest on Reunion Island. Sugar content varies throughout fruit development according to three processes (the supply of carbohydrates to the fruit, fruit metabolism, and dilution) which are affected by environmental factors, mainly temperature, rainfall and fertilization. The ecophysiological model of soluble sugar accumulation was linked to SIMPIÑA, a crop model that accurately predicts the daily increases in flesh dry and fresh weight. When the process-based model and crop model were linked, the dry and fresh matter of the pineapple flesh, as affected by climatic conditions, {{could be used as}} inputs to predict the TSS (%) at harvest. The relative rate of transformation of carbon as sugars in the fruit flesh for the synthesis of compounds other than sugars was estimated during fruit growth. TSS (%) were compared for harvested fruit grown under eight agro-climatic conditions. In the flesh of fruit harvested close to maturity, i. e., at 1400 degree-days after flowering, TSS (%) were significantly related (r 2 = 0. 55, P < 0. 001) to total soluble sugar content. The variability of TSS (%) between the eight agro-climatic groups ranged from 16. 9 for pineapples grown in dry locations irrigated, under N-deficit conditions to 19. 4 for pineapples grown in dry locations, without irrigation and without N deficiency. The variability of TSS (%) was substantial within each of the eight agro-climatic groups: standard deviations ranged from 0. 9 to 1. 5 for pineapples grown in dry locations, irrigated, without N deficiency and in dry locations, without irrigation and without N deficiency, respectively. For data from 14 experiments conducted under different climatic conditions, N fertilization, and irrigation conditions, the model predicted the TSS (%) at harvest with an RRMSE of 0. 04. By linking this sugar model to the SIMPIÑA crop model, the impact of environmental conditions and cultural practices on the growth and development of pineapple are taken into account to predict the <b>gustatory</b> <b>quality</b> of pineapple grown on Reunion Island. The model could have a practical application to manage fruit quality, plan harvest, and marketing. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

40|$|Not only do {{scientists}} make objects matter, act {{and resist}} in the world. Simple producers as wine producers do it too. However, {{they do not}} resort on laboratories, or research and metrology networks. How do they achieve such a performance? Our communication explores this issue by examining the controversy surrounding the wine quality sign AOC, a French quality label based on “terroirs”- terroirs being a collective understanding of wine quality based on nature and culture interactions. Terroir advocate wine-growers are calling into question the AOC capacity to differentiate between qualities; they highlight the “drift” in standard of the AOC label and contest its capacity to clearly differentiate the terroir quality of the AOC wines. They are therefore asking for a reform of the AOC quality sign {{in order to make}} it more discriminating. The administration has answered by asking the producers to provide for guarantees of the presence of terroir, and namely criteria allowing for a terroir test. Scientists have tried to isolate an “authentic” terroir quality, but without success. Other attempts to define terroir and its <b>gustatory</b> <b>qualities</b> were equally vain. As a consequence, the same scientists often contest the validity of these notions and the claims put forward by the label users; and the impossibility of supplying identification tests for terroir quality fuels their doubts. In their point of view, terroir is nothing more than a pure “social construction”, that is, a void illusion, a competition barrier or a support for social stratification. Therefore, the reform the producers ask for is in stand by. But why cannot scientists provide for a test of terroir? Those scientists would answer: “because terroir does not have any ‘real’ referent”. We venture a different interpretation by showing that the wine producers have come up with a particular procedure to make terroir matter, distinct from the classic scientific way. They do not proceed through the “objectivation” of a “thing” called terroir. They recur to a collective critique-framed procedure, which spreads the terroir over a myriad of judges who try to appreciate it. Therefore, its definition and interpretation are definitively distributed, which makes one of the basic scientific proofs, the test, useless: it is impossible to build a test involving only a limited amount of “representative” people in a “representative” place at a “representative” moment in time. This other production of knowledge, which is comparable to “hot” science, that is the knowledge-in-the-making, in turn, requires to invent a different way to test and guarantee “things”. This implies for STS to go further into the description of the “state of being” of these objects, which, the article argues, is not merely a question of “construction” of the knowledge, but of its ontology and the hypotheses we make about representation...|$|R

Taste {{disorders in}} the elderly Magdalena Sykuła, Aleksandra Stelmach, Monika Szacoń, Katarzyna Kuśmierz, Małgorzata Sutuła, Marcin Rząca, Hanna Kachaniuk Introduction: Disorders of the sense of taste mainly affect the elderly. There are many factors that contribute to their development, including various types of chronic diseases, polypharmacy, and the use of stimulants. Taste impairments lead to improper nutritional behaviour in the elderly, which may cause deterioration of their health and reduce their quality of life. Goal: The aim of the study was to estimate taste deficits in the elderly. Method: The participants were 24 persons aged 70 – 86. Sample size was limited by the number of available professional taste test kits (for identification of the four basic gustatory qualities: sweet, salty, sour, and bitter). The respondents were assisted by a researcher to fill in a survey about their health status, eating habits, and subjective assessment of their taste function. Results: Most of the elderly persons assessed their taste function as being good, and the rating increased with the age of the participants. However, the organoleptic test showed that taste identification became less accurate with age. The participants had the greatest trouble recognizing the salty (58 %) and sour (79 %) tastes and had much less difficulty identifying the sweet (96 %) and bitter (92 %) tastes. The subjects' perception of taste became less and less intense with age. Conclusions: 	The seniors were the least likely to accurately recognize the salty taste. 	With age, the accuracy of identification of sweet, sour, bitter and salty <b>gustatory</b> <b>qualities</b> became lower. 	The positive subjective assessment of the taste function in the elderly did not go hand in hand with their actual taste perception, which declined with age. 	The use of stimulants such as alcohol and tobacco, pharmacological treatment of chronic diseases, and use dental prostheses reduced the perceived intensity of taste. 	The taste disorders observed among the elderly can lead to dietary mistakes and thus negatively affect their health. Key words: dysgeusia, seniors, eating habits, health risk...|$|R
