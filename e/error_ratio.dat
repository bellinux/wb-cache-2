Twenty-four kindergarten children with delayed phonemic segmentation skills were taught to segment phonemes through a 20 -lesson, 10 -minutes-per-day, group intervention with two levels of scaffolding. The two experimental conditions each contained 12 students (one subgroup each of three, four, and five students) who had been matched on their segmentation pretest performance and randomly assigned to an instructional condition. One group was taught to segment with two-dimensional boxes serving as concrete phonemic representations and another group participated in a strictly verbal format. A curriculum, including a six-skill hierarchy, was developed based on principles of effective phonological awareness instruction for diverse learners. Scripted, small-group lessons and individual booster sessions were conducted in general-education classrooms to develop skill mastery. A 2 x 6 randomized block design examined effects across six segmentation measures (pretest, three progress monitoring checks, posttest, and skill maintenance check). Growth in phonemic blending was also assessed as a measure of generalization. Instructional efficiency was gauged by evaluating student opportunities to respond and <b>error</b> <b>ratios</b> during instruction. Student satisfaction was also examined across conditions. Analyses revealed that both instructional conditions resulted in improved student performance on every segmentation measure; however, {{there were no significant differences}} between the instructional conditions for first sound, onset-time, segmenting all phonemes, or total segmenting scores. The concrete condition resulted in a statistically significant superior performance on the blending measure. The experimental conditions did not differ statistically on measures of opportunities to respond and <b>error</b> <b>ratios,</b> the measures of instructional efficiency. Statistically significant differences were noted for group size, as smaller instructional groups performed better than larger groups on total segmenting gains, opportunities to respond, and <b>error</b> <b>ratios.</b> Two time effects were observed: (a) instructional efficiency improved as the students progressed through the curriculum, and (b) afternoon instruction resulted in lower <b>error</b> <b>ratios</b> than morning instruction. There were no differences in student satisfaction between the concretes and no-concretes conditions...|$|R
