40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effects of}} differential turnover patterns {{and the existence of}} firm specific training, jointly financed by employer and employee, on male-female wage and employment differentials. Chapter 1 introduces the topic of sex differences in occupational distribution and compensation and presents some of the more common economic theories which are relevant to the subject. Chapter 2 presents a model of a firm that <b>invests</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> of its workers, where employee turnover represents depreciation on human capital. Differences in the turnover rates of men and women is shown to be an important determinant of the incentive to the employer to hire and train women as well as men. The empirical implications of the model for the relative wage and occupational distribution of women are contrasted with those derived from a model of general human capital investment. Chapter 3 outlines the problems involved in empirical formulation of the model, the choice of the unit of observation for empirical, testing, and data limitations, and presents the results of empirical testing of the model on aggregate occupational data for males and females from the 1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity. In Chapter 4, the model is applied to occupational data from the 1967 Survey of Economic Opportunity for black and white men as an additional test of its applicability and empirical power. Chapter 5 summarizes the empirical findings and conclusions of the paper. ...|$|E

It is evident that, as opposed to other actions already developed by FHP professionals in other health care areas, which has appeared clearly and objectively. This fact is observed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> daily activities of FHP professionals, which give little attention to drugs-related problems. However, research emphasizes that there exists a broad range of action possibilities for FHP professionals.

40|$|The {{capacity}} of early diagnosis of dementia to facilitate effective treatment and care is well established. The pivotal {{role of the}} GP has also been identified by research, although accuracy in detecting and diagnosing dementia {{at an early stage}} varies considerably. Despite the likely influence of attitude on practice, little is known about GP attitudes towards early diagnosis. This study collected attitudinal data, and supplementary commentary, from nearly 60 % of GPs in one health authority. The research suggests consistency between belief <b>in</b> <b>the</b> value of early diagnosis and reported practice. Specifically, results reveal that three variables significantly predict practice - a belief there are benefits to patients from early diagnosis, a belief that negative outcomes may result from a failure to diagnose early and the accessibility of local support services. Overall, the study found that 40 % of GPs hold positive views and 20 % hold negative views towards early diagnosis. These views are underpinned by specific ‘drivers’ and ‘barriers’. The study concludes that if GPs are to extend their commitment to early diagnosis, development work needs to focus on <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> and resources, which facilitate practice, and challenging attitudinal barriers, which undermine it...|$|R

40|$|The U. S. {{health care}} system is at a turning point, and no more so than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nation's hospitals. They face {{increasing}} pressures to provide more and better care at lower cost. At the same time, revenue streams [...] from Medicare and other sources [...] are uncertain, as is the future of health insurance reform. New models are emerging for coordinating care and delivering it in a patient-centered way, as are new technologies, from new diagnostic and treatment methods to electronic health records. And the emphasis on demonstrated, measurable evidence of hospital performance has rarely been greater. Yet one thing is constant: health care is a distinctly high-touch, labor-intensive enterprise. And it depends in part on workers at the front lines of care: nursing assistants, housekeepers, medical assistants, unit secretaries, dietary service workers, and a host of others who work 24 / 7 to answer call lights, empty bed pans, pass trays, or draw blood. Today, some health care providers are discovering that <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> education, <b>training,</b> and career advancement of these frontline workers pays off not only in dollars and cents but also in less measurable ways, including enhanced worker performance and skill, better functioning patient care teams, expanded pipelines for filling positions, and improved morale. <b>The</b> concept of <b>investing</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> frontline health care workforce is in good currency, but translating that into wider practice is not simple. At times, it requires overcoming the skepticism of decision makers, both private and public, about the value of long-term investments in human capital.

Furthermore, we check the effects of other variables which measure some distinctive features of local labour markets, like the degree of specialization, average firms’ size, intensity of job turnover, economic density, employment in R&D activities and some other control variables on the employers’ decision to <b>invest</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>training</b> of their workers.
