5000|$|The SexBomb Dancers were {{originally}} composed of four female dancers upon their formation in November 1999 (Rochelle, Che-che, Debra, Janine) {{with the name}} [...] "Chicken Sandwich Dancers" [...] as the background dancers of Eat Bulaga! and {{an offshoot of the}} Danz Focus Dancers (house dancers of the said gameshow). The name [...] "Sex Bomb" [...] came from Tom Jones hit song. Of the four, only Rochelle remained (thus landing her the role and title as the group leader) until the group expanded during their SexBomb dance searches in 2000-2001 and their first FHM appearances to an all-time high of 22. In 2002, the SexBomb Singers were formed, and were billed as [...] "SexBomb Girls" [...] in their shows and promotional materials, with their renowned first-published album Unang Putok in which the hit songs and crazes Bakit Papa?, ,Crush Kita, Pretty Little baby", [...] "Di Ko Na Mapipigilan" [...] and [...] "Tulog Na Baby" [...] emerged. In 2003 They release their sophomore album entitled [...] "Round 2" [...] which successfully hit with a song [...] "Spageti" [...] Featuring Joey De Leon. In 2004 Sexbomb girls released their third album entitled [...] "Bomb Thr3ath" [...] and a hit song [...] "Halukay Ube" [...] came out. The dancers did shows under their dance albums, Sexiest Hits in 2002, Sexiest Hits 2 in 2003, and Sexiest Hits 3 in 2004 which all hit a platinum record awards" [...]The SexBomb Singers and Dancers were then collectively referred to as The SexBomb Girls. The SexBomb Girls was managed by Joy Cancio, of <b>Focus</b> <b>E</b> Incorporated. Joy is veteran of the Vicor Dancers of the 1980s.|$|E
5000|$|Known {{for their}} {{platinum}} hits such as Spaghetti, Bakit Papa up to Bilog na Hugis Itlog, their latest single which was lauded for being instrumental in GMA-7’s Voter Education Campaign, the Sexbomb Dancers are raring {{more than ever}} to reach new heights and share the glory with a new member. Coming from humble beginnings themselves, they {{believe that there are}} many undiscovered dancers whose talents are worth seeing on television and whose dreams are worth fulfilling. <b>Focus</b> <b>E,</b> Incorporated and GMA Network, in harmony with the group’s belief, put together a dance reality show that will not only entertain but more importantly, capture a global quality of dancing. There will be rigorous training, unexpected challenges, various dance themes, wild transformations and a grand prize worth half a million pesos (250, 000 cash and 250,000 worth of contract) -all in the name of selecting and honing the one best dancer. To host the show are no less than the Badboy of the Dance Floor Mark Herras and Sexbomb Diva Izzy Trazona. Since the hopefuls are unavoidably budding showbiz personalities, they will be tested on and off the stage. From Monday to Friday, the sizzling duo of Mark and Izzy will update audiences about their progress, setbacks, personal issues and whatnots. As the hopefuls bust their moves, they will be under the meticulous eye of judges composed of choreographer extraordinaire Maribeth Bechara, Sexbomb leader Rochelle Pangilinan and a surprise guest of the week. The audiences too will determine who deserves to stay via their text votes. Sexbomb guru Joy Cancio and Sexbomb adviser Presley Balili, aside from giving constant moral support, will also help in the first wave of the elimination process. Of course, the show would not be complete without the Sexbomb Girls themselves. Together, they will test the hopefuls’ skills and determination by becoming showdown masters who will either teach or compete with the contestants. All these plus loads of bombastic twists and turns, literally and figuratively, await the hopefuls. Who will be the top 40 auditionees that will officially dance their way to stardom? Who will deliver the loudest bomb on the dance floor and grab the coveted title of Sexbomb dancer? ...|$|E
40|$|This {{meta-analysis}} synthesized 102 {{effect sizes}} reflecting {{the relation between}} specific moods and creativity. Effect sizes overall revealed that positive moods produce more creativity than mood-neutral controls (r =. 15), but {{no significant differences between}} negative moods and mood-neutral controls (r = -. 03) or between positive and negative moods (r =. 04) were observed. Creativity is enhanced most by positive mood states that are activating and associated with an approach motivation and promotion <b>focus</b> (<b>e.</b> g., happiness), rather than those that are deactivating and associated with an avoidance motivation and prevention <b>focus</b> (<b>e.</b> g., relaxed). Negative, deactivating moods with an approach motivation and a promotion <b>focus</b> (<b>e.</b> g., sadness) were not associated with creativity, but negative, activating moods with an avoidance motivation and a prevention focus (fear, anxiety) were associated with lower creativity, especially when assessed as cognitive flexibility. With a few exceptions, these results generalized across experimental and correlational designs, populations (students vs. general adult population), and facet of creativity (e. g., fluency, flexibility, originality, eureka/insight).

40|$|Mainstream {{approaches}} {{in the design}} of virtual libraries basically exploit the same ambient space as their physical twins. Our paper is an attempt to rather capture automatically the actual space on which the books live, and learn the virtual library as a non-linear book manifold. This tackles tantalizing questions, chief among which whether modeling should be static and book <b>focused</b> (<b>e.</b> g. using bag of words encoding) or dynamic and user <b>focused</b> (<b>e.</b> g. relying on what we define as a bag of readers encoding). Experiments on a real-world digital library display that the latter encoding is a serious challenger to the former. Our results also show that the geometric layers of the manifold learned bring sizeable advantages for retrieval and visualization purposes. For example, the topological layer of the manifold allows to craft Manifold association rules; experiments display that they bring dramatic improvements over conventional association rules built from the discrete topology of book sets. Improvements embrace each of the following major standpoints on association rule mining: computational, support, confidence, lift, and leverage standpoint...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the co-activation of cooperation versus competition goals with regulatory focus, and tested whether the combined effects on creativity are interactive or additive. An experiment with 192 adults showed two main effects, such that participants with a cooperation goal and a promotion <b>focus</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>focus</b> on ideals) demonstrated {{the highest levels of}} originality of ideas, whereas the combination of a competition goal and a prevention <b>focus</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>focus</b> on duties) led to the lowest originality. These findings indicate that the two motivational constructs have additive effects which lead to the highest originality if a promotion focus and a cooperation goal are co-activated, whereas a prevention focus and a competition goal may diminish originality. In conclusion, the concurrent activation of multiple motivational constructs should be considered when investigating the situational effects of cooperative/competitive settings on creativity...|$|R
40|$|This paper builds upon Colin McFarlane's 2011 call in City for an ‘assemblage urbanism’ to {{supplement}} critical urbanism. It does so by mapping the spatio-political contours of London's 21 st-century housing crisis through the geophilosophical framework of Deleuze and Guattari's A Thousand Plateaus ([1980] 2013, London: Bloomsbury] and Hardt and Negri's {{analysis of the}} metropolis in Commonwealth (2009, Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press). The paper examines the <b>Focus</b> <b>E</b> 15 housing campaign based around {{a group of young}} mothers in the East London borough of Newham. In 2013, the mothers were living in the <b>Focus</b> <b>E</b> 15 foyer supported housing unit for young people in Newham, but they were subsequently threatened with eviction as a result of welfare cuts. After successfully contesting the mothers’ own prospective expulsion from the city, the campaign shifted to the broader struggle for ‘social housing not social cleansing’. The paper draws upon participant observation at campaign events and interviews with key members. The <b>Focus</b> <b>E</b> 15 campaign has engaged in a series of actions which form a distinctive way of undertaking housing politics in London, a politics that can be understood using a Deleuzoguattarian framework. Several campaign actions, including temporary occupations, are analysed. It is argued that these actions have created ‘smooth space’ in a manner which is to an extent distinctive from many other London housing campaigns which are rooted in a more sedentary defensive approach based around the protection of existing homes and communities—‘our place’. It is such spatio-political creativity—operating as a ‘nomadic war machine'—which has given rise to the high-profile reputation of the <b>Focus</b> <b>E</b> 15 campaigners as inspirational young women who do not ‘know their place’...|$|E

40|$|When {{operating}} in multiteam settings, {{it is important}} that goals are cohesive between team members, especially in high-stakes, risky, and uncertain environments. This study explored goal consistency during a multiteam emergency response simulation. A total of n = 50 commanders from the UK Police Services, Fire and Rescue Services, and Ambulance Services took part in a simulated terrorism exercise, who were split into n = 13 teams. Each team responded to the same simulated terrorist event, which was based on a ‘Marauding Terrorist Firearms Attack’ (MTFA) at a city centre train station. Data were collected using electronically time-stamped ‘decision logs’ and post-incident questionnaires that measured team members’ self-reported goals. Goals that were ‘attack’ <b>focussed</b> (<b>e.</b> g., ‘treat patients’) were coded as ‘approach’ (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>focussed</b> on achieving positive outcomes) and goals that were ‘defence’ <b>focussed</b> (<b>e.</b> g., protect emergency responders) were coded as ‘avoid’ (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>focussed</b> on avoiding negative outcomes). It emerged that different agencies prioritized different goal types; Fire commanders initially prioritized avoid goals but then increased approach orientations, Ambulance commanders were consistently approach oriented, and Police commanders showed goal conflict (tensions between adopting approach and avoid goals). Despite goal differences, participants rated that their interagency goals were consistent in a post-scenario questionnaire, suggesting that commanders were unaware of the nuanced differences between their agency-specific objectives. At the multiteam level, teams who predominantly held attack/approach goals were significantly faster at decision logging early in the incident, yet defend/avoid teams were faster at decision logging later into the incident. Implications for multiteam coordination are discussed...|$|R

40|$|According to {{embodied}} cognition theories, {{concepts are}} contextually situated and grounded in neural systems that produce experiential states. This view predicts that processing mental state concepts recruits neural regions associated with {{different aspects of}} experience {{depending on the context}} in which people understand a concept. This neuroimaging study tested this prediction using a set of sentences that described emotional (e. g., fear, joy) and nonemotional (e. g., thinking, hunger) mental states with internal <b>focus</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>focusing</b> on bodily sensations and introspection) or external <b>focus</b> (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>focusing</b> on expression and action). Consistent with our predictions, data suggested that the inferior frontal gyrus, a region associated with action representation, was engaged more by external than internal sentences. By contrast, the ventromedial prefrontal cortex, a region associated with the generation of internal states, was engaged more by internal emotion sentences than external sentence categories. Similar patterns emerged when we examined the relationship between neural activity and independent ratings of sentence focus. Furthermore, ratings of emotion were associated with activation in the medial prefrontal cortex, whereas ratings of activity were associated with activation in the inferior frontal gyrus. These results suggest that mental state concepts are represented in a dynamic way, using context-relevant interoceptive and sensorimotor resources...|$|R
