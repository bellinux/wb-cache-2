50|$|The Dodinga Hills <b>guereza</b> hasn't been {{recorded}} since the 1960s. Unlike most other primate species, the mantled <b>guereza</b> can survive habitat degradation {{and can even}} thrive in degraded forests. Sometimes, logging may {{increase the number of}} preferred food trees for the mantled <b>guereza</b> and it is more abundant in logged areas than unlogged ones. However, complete forest clearance causes dramatic declines in numbers. In Uganda complete forest clearings caused a decline of 50% over eight years. The mantled <b>guereza</b> is also threatened by hunting for meat and its skin. Mantled <b>guereza</b> meat sells as bushmeat for $4-9 US. The skins have been sold for fashion or in the tourist trade.|$|E

2500|$|Opened in 2003, the Destination Africa {{project was}} among the zoo's most ambitious expansions. [...] The complex of four {{buildings}} includes the TransAlta Rainforest and the African Savannah. The TransAlta Rainforest occupies 2,900 square metres (31,000 square feet) and features a collection of African rainforest flora and fauna. The African Savannah building is home to hippos, giraffes, red river hogs, and a baobab tree. A 340,000-litre (80,000-gallon) indoor pool for hippos offers view of the creatures underwater. In the warmer months, the doors lift to connect the building {{with the rest of}} the Savannah exhibit, home to zebras, grey crowned cranes and ostriches. Many other animals of the grasslands, including African lions, also reside in the Savannah exhibit. In the TransAlta Rainforest, there are mammalian primates such as gorillas, <b>guerezas,</b> and mandrills, and a number of reptiles including Leopard tortoises, [...] Malagasy tree boas, a panther chameleon and a pair of broad-snouted crocodiles, as well as an aviary containing various species of African birds.|$|R

5000|$|Because it {{can live}} in both dry and gallery forests and move on the ground, the mantled <b>guereza</b> is less {{threatened}} than many other colobine species. The IUCN lists it as Least Concern because [...] "although locally threatened in parts of its range, this widespread species is not thought to be declining fast enough to place it in a higher category of threat." [...] However, some of the subspecies are classified under different categories. The Mt Uaraguess <b>guereza,</b> C. g. percivali, is listed as Endangered due to its small range and its risk from hunting, while the Dodinga Hills <b>guereza,</b> C. g. dodingae, the Djaffa Mountains <b>guereza,</b> C. g. gallarum, and the Mau Forest <b>guereza,</b> C. g. matschiei are all listed as Data Deficient.|$|E
5000|$|The mantled <b>guereza</b> {{is in the}} Colobinae {{subfamily}}, {{also known}} as the leaf-eating monkeys, a group of Old World monkeys from Asia and Africa. This subfamily is split into three groups, the colobus monkeys of Africa, of which the mantled <b>guereza</b> is a part, the langurs, or leaf monkeys, of Asia, and an [...] "odd-nosed" [...] group. The African colobus monkeys are divided again by distinctions in color, behavior, and ecology. The three genera are the black-and-white colobi, the red colobi, and the olive colobi. There are three black-and-white colobi: the mantled <b>guereza,</b> Colobus <b>guereza,</b> the king colobus, C. polykomos, and the Angola colobus, C. angolensis. Groves lists seven subspecies of mantled <b>guereza</b> in Mammal Species of the World (MSW) (2005). The validity of the Djaffa Mountain <b>guereza,</b> C. g. gallarum, is uncertain, although not listed by Groves in MSW, it is recognised in his 2007 Colobinae review paper, and by International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) assessors Gippolliti and Butynski in 2008.|$|E
40|$|Socioecological models {{assume that}} quality and {{distribution}} of food ultimately determine female social relationships: a high quality diet and clumped food distribution should result {{in the establishment of}} a hierarchy with stable rank relations which is supported by empirical studies on frugivorous cercopithecines. By contrast, folivorous species with their low quality diet and dispersed food distribution should have egalitarian social relationships but empirical data are very rare. This study on female <b>guerezas</b> of a zoo group aimed to test the models in a colobine species and the results largely agreed with the predictions of the models: facial expressions, vocalizations, and gestures were not used for signalling dominance or subordination. Unritualized aggressions occurred frequently but were of low intensity, and interventions by third parties were never observed. Aggressions were exchanged bidirectionally and this was true also for food stealing and retreats. All this indicated the lack of established rank relations. Allogrooming was distributed rather equally and showed no kin bias. All these features characterize egalitarian social relationships and, hence, support the socioecological models...|$|R
50|$|The {{most diverse}} class of prey {{in the diet}} as known are mammals, with over 90 {{mammalian}} prey species reported. In the Cape Province, the 2.1 kg cape hare (Lepus capensis) reportedly dominates the prey selection, comprising about 53% of the foods selected. Other lagomorphs, namely the slightly smaller Smith's red rock hare (Pronolagus rupestris), mildly larger African savanna hare (Lepus microtis) and the much larger 3.6 kg scrub hare (Lepus saxatilis), are not infrequently taken both in {{and outside of the}} Cape area, but lagomorphs are not typically the main prey elsewhere. For the most part rodents are ignored as prey as they are probably too small despite martial eagles taking at times appreciable numbers of Cape (Xerus inauris) and unstriped ground squirrels (Xerus rutilus). However, rodents selected as prey have ranged in size from the 0.14 kg Southern African vlei rat (Otomys irroratus) to the 3.04 kg South African springhare (Pedetes capensis) and the 4 kg greater cane rat (Thryonomys swinderianus). There are records of predation on 0.28 kg (the second largest African bat) straw-coloured fruit bats (Eidolon helvum) and galagos of various sizes (usually weighing a kilo or less) but otherwise mammalian prey they pursue tends to be relatively larger.Locally, large numbers are taken of any species of hyrax. The attractiveness of hyraxes as a prey resource may encourage martial eagles to vary their hunting techniques to potentially more time-consuming perch hunting so that they may capture rock hyraxes from rock formations and tree hyraxes from trees, contrary to their usual preference for capturing prey {{on the ground in the}} open after soaring high. Ranging in average mass from 2.2 to 3.14 kg, hyraxes can comprise a healthy meal for a family of martial eagle and are probably among the larger items that male eagles will regularly deliver to nests. Another miscellaneous mammal known to fall prey to martial eagles is the ground pangolin (Smutsia temminckii), although it is not clear the age pangolins that are preyed on and how they are dispatched, considering that adults weigh some 11.6 kg and have a hard keratin shell that is capable of withstanding lion (Panthera leo) jaws when in its rolled-up defensive posture. Although far less accomplished and prolific as a predator of monkeys than the crowned eagle, the martial eagle has been known to prey on at least 14 species of monkey. The monkeys to turn up most often as martial eagle prey are grivets (Chlorocebus aethiops), vervet monkeys (Chlorocebus pygerythrus) and malbroucks (Chlorocebus cynosuros), with mean body masses of 2.8 kg, 4.12 kg and 4.53 kg, respectively, because of their savanna-woods dwelling habits, tendencies to forage on the ground and their primarily diurnal activity. Similarly, the larger Patas monkey (Erythrocebus patas), at 8.13 kg, also dwells in similar habitats and so may be subject to occasional predaceous attacks. There’s evidence that these monkey species have specific alarm calls, distinct from those uttered in response to the presence of a leopard (Panthera pardus) for example, specifically for martial eagles. Martial eagles are also known to prey on mangabeys, Cercopithecus sp., colobus monkeys and <b>guerezas,</b> presumably around forest clearings, but these are probably quantitatively rare as prey given their forest-dwelling habits. Predatory attacks by martial eagles have been reported as well for every species of baboon, although either mostly or entirely on young ones, and even on young chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes). It has been claimed that juvenile monkeys are the most often selected as prey by martial eagles, even for species as small as vervet monkeys but little comprehensive analysis is known on this (the most accomplished primate predator, the crowned eagle, in Uganda, selects adult monkeys 52% of the time, juveniles 48% of the time). On the hand, at times, martial eagles may at times be able to dispatch adult male monkeys weighing 9 kg or more, such as patas monkeys and Tana River mangabeys (Cercocebus galeritus), in seldom cases.|$|R

50|$|Like all colobi, the mantled <b>guereza</b> is able {{to digest}} leaves and other plant fibers with a large, multi-chambered stomach that {{contains}} bacteria in certain areas.

The mantled <b>guereza</b> is mostly preyed on by the crowned hawk-eagle, but it is also eaten by other birds of prey such as Verreaux's eagle.

50|$|The mantled <b>guereza</b> is {{primarily}} arboreal, but does sometimes descend {{on the ground}} to forage and travel, perhaps more so than most other colobines.

Sometime after dawn, mantled <b>guereza</b> groups leave their sleeping trees and will return to them at dusk. During the day, the mantled <b>guereza</b> has long rest periods in between periods of moving and feeding.

50|$|The mantled <b>guereza</b> is {{distributed}} throughout Equatorial Africa. It ranges from Nigeria and Cameroon {{in the west}} to Ethiopia, Kenya, Uganda, and northern Tanzania in the east. The mantled <b>guereza</b> lives in both deciduous and evergreen forests. It mainly inhabits forest and savannah woodlands and often extend into highland and montane forests. It can be found in other forest habitats, both primary and secondary, such as riparian (near fresh or brackish water), gallery, and upland forests. It is particularly common in forests close to rivers and lakes and at high elevations. It can be found in elevations as high as 3300 m. This species prefers secondary forests and selects them over old-growth forests if given the choice. It is likely that the mantled <b>guereza</b> prefers these forests due to the increased number of food trees and the weaker chemical defenses of the species within. The mantled <b>guereza</b> is sometimes found in swamps as well as human-made habitats such as Eucalyptus plantations, which may be frequented when the monkey has nutritional deficiencies.|$|E
