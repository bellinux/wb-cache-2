50|$|Reese accepts <b>Finch's</b> {{offer and}} begins {{following}} Diane Hansen, an assistant district attorney. <b>Finch</b> takes Reese to his hidden workplace, a disused library <b>Finch</b> bought via a bank he controls. As they work together, Reese teaches <b>Finch</b> about his strategies, and becomes increasingly curious about who <b>Finch</b> is, fueled by <b>Finch's</b> insistence he's {{a very private}} person. Furnished with six cover identities and funds, Reese sees <b>Finch's</b> lengthy list for the first time; social security numbers the origin of which <b>Finch</b> refuses to divulge. As Reese undertakes his investigation, he and <b>Finch</b> establish their working model: Reese {{in the field and}} <b>Finch</b> on the computer continuously connected by cell phone and ear bud as each report to the other.|$|R

50|$|<b>Finch's</b> {{approach}} to the <b>Finch</b> SS100 is somewhat different to the other SS100 replica manufacturers. <b>Finch</b> endeavoured to recreate their <b>Finch</b> SS100 as faithfully as possible and do not use the XJ6 as the base donor car. <b>Finch</b> sourced original factory drawings and build their SS100 chassis to the original design. The bodies of the <b>Finch</b> SS100 are made from aluminium metal-shaped to fit the traditional wooden frames built by <b>Finch.</b> <b>Finch</b> SS100 mechanicals are sourced from 'deceased' MkIV and SS Jaguars to obtain contemporary components.|$|R
50|$|Dormer {{learns that}} Burr {{has gone to}} <b>Finchâ€™s.</b> He finds Kay's letters in <b>Finch's</b> {{apartment}} and realizes that <b>Finch</b> intends to kill Burr. He learns of <b>Finch's</b> lake house and rushes there. At the house, <b>Finch</b> knocks Burr unconscious just as Dormer arrives. Dormer is too disoriented from lack of sleep to fight off <b>Finch.</b> Burr revives and saves Dormer, while <b>Finch</b> escapes. Burr reveals she knows Dormer shot Eckhart, and {{he admits that he}} is no longer certain if it was an accident. From his shed, <b>Finch</b> shoots at them with a shotgun, and Burr returns fire while Dormer sneaks around to <b>Finch's</b> location. After a scuffle, <b>Finch</b> shoots Dormer, who shoots and kills <b>Finch.</b> Burr rushes to the fatally wounded Dormer's aid and comforts him by affirming that Eckhart's shooting was accidental, then moves to throw away the shell casing to preserve Dormer's secret. Dormer stops Burr, however, telling her not to lose her way and tells her to let him sleep as he dies.|$|R

5|$|The Fijian parrotfinch is {{endemic to}} a single country; {{although}} its population is unknown, it is described as uncommon or locally common. In the absence of evidence for any decline in numbers, its population {{is believed to be}} stable, and it is therefore classed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List. It is protected under Schedule 2 of Fiji's Endangered and Protected Species Act 2002, which regulates the import and trade of species that are not thought to be at a high risk of extinction, but may be threatened if trade in those species is not regulated. In the early 20th century, Europeans in Fiji kept these <b>finches</b> as cagebirds, calling them croton <b>finches</b> because of their liking for the croton bush, but the pet trade appears not to be a significant factor at present.|$|E

5|$|Raptors, songbirds, {{and ground}} birds {{are found in}} the park's grassland, while the Puerco River's {{riparian}} corridor is a good place for year-round residents as well as migrants such as warblers, vireos, avocets, and killdeer. Developed areas around the visitor center and museum attract western tanagers, hermit warblers, house <b>finches,</b> and others. Occasional shorebirds and eastern birds also visit the park.|$|E
5|$|The American {{goldfinch}} {{is found}} in residential areas throughout its range. Backyard birders attract it using feeders containing Nyjer thistle seed, or by planting grasses and perennial plants, such as zinnias, cosmos, bee balm, or globe thistle, which produce seedheads favored by <b>finches.</b> Although some controversy surrounds bird feeding (see bird feeder for details), an increase in backyard feeding by humans has generally been beneficial to this species.|$|E

50|$|The citril <b>finch</b> {{differs from}} the Corsican <b>finch</b> C. corsicana in habitat selection. While the {{mainland}} citril <b>finch</b> is rather restricted to subalpine coniferous forests and alpine meadows, the insular Corsican <b>finch</b> {{may be found in}} different habitats from sea level to the highest mountain slopes. The citril <b>finch</b> nests mainly in conifers such as pines (Pinus) and spruces (Picea) while the Corsican <b>finch</b> uses also lower bushes such as tree Heath (Erica arborea), juniper (Juniperus) and bramble (Rubus).|$|R

It will also feed on invertebrates, especially during the breeding season when the young are fed mainly on animal food; it takes insects, woodlice, millipedes, centipedes, spiders and harvestmen.|$|E
5|$|They {{went on to}} Albemarle Island, where Darwin saw a small jet {{of smoke}} from a {{recently}} active volcano. On 1 October he landed near Tagus Cove and explored Beagle Crater. There he saw his first Galapagos land iguanas. Water pits were disappointingly inadequate for drinking, but attracted swarms of small birds and Darwin made his only note of the <b>finches</b> he was not bothering to label by island. He caught a third species of mockingbird.|$|E
