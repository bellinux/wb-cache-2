5|$|This road {{would serve}} as the initial mail road linking Kingston to Toronto, but was poorly {{maintained}} and soon allowed to fall into disrepair. By 1817, the Kingston Road replaced or bypass much of Danforth's Road, following a similar path to the Trent River (with minor improvements in routing around Scarborough, Port Hope, Cobourg and Grafton) but then blazing a more northerly route through Belleville and Napanee. Like the Danforth Road before it, this 1817 York Road was initially a muddy dirt road; it would, however, suffice to establish reliable scheduled stagecoach runs by which mail and passengers could make the two-day trip from Kingston to Toronto and permit enterprises (such as {{the branches of the}} newly established Bank of Montreal) safe and timely <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>documents</b> and valuables. By 1839, the Napanee-Kingston route was being improved for use as a gravel toll road.|$|E

40|$|Present day summarisation {{technologies}} are imperfect. At {{a certain level}} of abstraction, they all work by performing data reduction over the original document source. In order for such summaries to be useful, it is necessary to be able to know how they relate to the documents. In order for such summaries to be usable, it is necessary for them to function as windows into the whole documents, with suitably designed interfaces for navigation into areas of particular interest. This paper discusses the notion of strong contextualisation <b>of</b> <b>document</b> highlights, how this translates into necessary features for document analysis, and how the document abstractions derived from such principles facilitate dynamic <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> content. We argue that dynamic document abstractions effectively mediate different levels of granularity of analysis, from terse document highlights to fully contextualised foci of particular interest.

40|$|We propose {{and compare}} {{different}} schemes to implement an automated <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> <b>document</b> updates through a caching infrastructure.

When documents are updated at fixed times {{or when they}} are updated randomly but clients and servers are willing to risk a small degree of staleness, automated pull with a caching infrastructure has a low bandwidth usage, keeps the number of requests at the origin server low, and reduces the network traffic generated by the poll messages. However, when clients always require the most upto -date document version, pull generates many requests to the origin server. For this situation, we consider a true push scheme through a caching infrastructure, which can be implemented with small modifications of the existing protocols and requires little state information at the origin server and the caches.
