40|$|The play is a deconstructive {{reading of}} great American writer Ray Bradbury’s {{most famous and}} {{influential}} work, <b>FARENHEIT</b> 451. It is also informed by the important filmic re-workings of the story, including the recent use of the concept and title in Michael Moore’s documentary <b>FARENHEIT</b> 9 / 11. The play uses research into the concept of reading as subversion in Bradbury’s novella, as in Greenburg (1980) and Johnson (1980) and then uses post-modern concepts of citation and pastiche to re-work the plot {{to make it into}} a contemporary story. Also relevant is Milan Kundera’s novella SLOWNESS, which examines the post-modern cult of speed...|$|E

40|$|This paper, {{first result}} of a larger research, proposes a query about some aspects of social {{representation}} of libraries and librarians, as they appear in literary and cinematographic productions. Little by little, this query, which arose from purposes of organizing catalogues, revealed elements that established different series, in which the narrative genre (literary or cinematographic) has no relevance to either libraries or librarians` representations. The presence of these elements seems to show some expectations and utopias {{in relation to the}} common knowledge, independently from narratives being located in the past, in the present or in the future, stimulating reflection on some medieval and baroque traditions about the library universe and its main characters, the librarians. The cinematographic material selected for research was The time machine, <b>Farenheit</b> 451, The day after tomorrow, Star Wars - episode II and the novels Martin Eden, The man without qualities, The time machine and La sombra del viento...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} an efficient solution to monitor in real time, uniformly and continuously the temperature evolution in vats hosting for must fermentation. The environment {{is characterized by}} strong temperature gradients with fast evolutions, and this justifies {{the need for a}} pervasive and dense measurement. Inside the vats several mechanical operations are continuously performed, and these may cause disruptions to cables of any form. Despite these characteristics, which might require the deployment of wireless sensor nodes, the environment is difficult to the radio propagation and aggressive for all electronic parts. Moreover, recently the wine makers would like to follow the temperature evolution with precisions below 0. 8 degree <b>Farenheit,</b> and this requires the construction of sensors with improved analogue/digital conversion. All these requirements have been matched by setting up a wireless sensor network solution in the 865 / 915 MHz bandwidths, which uses PT 100. The solution has been tested during the fermentation of the 2014 vintage in Montalcino, Italy...|$|E
40|$|Indoor Air Quality is an {{increasing}} concern in the world today. The mere presence {{of people in a}} building or residence can signiﬁcantly alter indoor air quality. Relative humidity over the range of normal indoor temperatures (66 - 80 degrees <b>Farenheit)</b> has been linked both directly and indirectly to various health and structural problems. The purpose of this project was to discover whether residential dwellings might beneﬁt from an indoor humidiﬁcation system. The project consisted of the deployment of three separate sensor networks consisting of 12 tmote sky modules manufactured by the Moteiv corporation, each equipped with a temperature and humidity sensor manufactured by Sensirion. Each tmote sky module continuously transmitted the raw data readings to a base station to be processed. The lifetime of each network was approximately four days of continuous data transmission. The results veriﬁed the hypothesis that relative humidity levels have a signiﬁcant affect on the indoor environment and can be linked to the health and structural problems reported by the occupants of each monitored residence. Based on the project ﬁndings residential dwellings would beneﬁt from an indoor humidiﬁcation system, given the symptoms associated with relative humidity level problems exist...|$|E
40|$|This {{study is}} an {{examination}} of the rhetorical concept of the dialectic as it is realized in selected works of North American dystopian literature. The dialectic {{is one of the main}} factors in curtailing enlightenment rationalism which, taken to an extreme, would deny man freedom while claiming to bestow freedom upon him. The focus of this dissertation is on an analysis of twentieth-century dystopias and the dialectic of Fyodor Dostoevsky's Grand Inquisitor parable which is a precursor to dystopian literature. The Grand Inquisitor parable of The Brothers Karamazov is a blueprint for dystopian states delineated in anti-utopian fiction. Also, Dostoevsky's parable constitutes a powerful dialectical struggle between polar opposites which are presented in the following twentieth-century dystopias: Zamiatin's Me, Bradbury's <b>Farenheit</b> 451, Vonnegut's Player Piano, and Atwood's The Handmaid's Tale. The dialectic in the dystopian genre presents a give and take between the opposites of faith and doubt, liberty and slavery, and it often presents the individual of the anti-utopian state with a choice. When presented with the dialectic, then, the individual is presented with the capacity to make a real choice; therefore, he is presented with a hope for salvation in the totalitarian dystopias of modern twentieth-century literature...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} breed, backfat thickness, {{and methods of}} cooking on quality of beef roasts was {{determined}} by sensory and objective methods. Arm and rib roasts from Hereford, Shorthorn, Charolais, and Shorthorn-Charolais animals were cooked by several methods. Roasts of the ninth to twelfth ribs were all dry roasted at 325 <b>Farenheit.</b> Boned and unboned roasts (sixth to eighth ribs) were cooked by conventional and electronic methods. Only significant results are reported herein. Objective tests using the Warner-Bratzler shear indicated roasts of Shorthorn animals {{to be the most}} tender of the four breeds. Sensory analysis by an experienced panel of judges rated roasts of Hereford and Shorthorn to be most tender, juicy, and flavorful. Conventional methods of cooking resulted in higher quality beef than did electronic cooking. Greater total losses, less juiciness, less flavor, and less tenderness were recorded for meat cooked by microwave activity. There was a high correlation between objective and sensory measurements for tenderness and juiciness. Age of animal and shear values showed high correlation with the younger animals (11 months) in this study being less tender. Flavor was shown to be related to backfat thickness...|$|E
40|$|This essay {{begins the}} {{exploration}} of two contemporary and related film trends: the recent popular enthusiasm over the previously arty documentary film and the mandatory filming of custodial interrogations and confessions. The history and criticism of documentary film, indeed contemporary movie-going, understands the documentary genre as political and social advocacy (recent examples are Michael Moore 2 ̆ 7 s <b>Farenheit</b> 9 / 11 and Errol Morris 2 ̆ 7 s Fog of War). Judges, advocates, and legislatures, however, assume that films of custodial interrogations and confessions reveal a truth and lack a distorting point of view. As this Article explains, the trend at law, although aimed at furthering venerable criminal justice principles, holds a fairly naïve view of film 2 ̆ 7 s indexical relationship to the lived world and abjures consideration of the contemporary trend in cinema. Understanding the documentary as truth-revealing is a mistake, a mistake which can frustrate (if not undermine) the criminal justice goals of the legislation. Whatever may explain the convergence of filmmaking in the precinct house and a penchant for mainstream documentary movie-going, the trends are shaping contemporary expectations about film in contradictory ways. Investigating these trends together exposes competing norms regarding film as a legal tool and as a knowledge producing discourse. It also situates the criminal justice trend {{in the context of}} a long history of filmmaking and critical spectatorship. In light of the growing use of film as a policing mechanism, better understanding of film as both an art and a legal tool is in order...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} {{was developed for}} calculating the radial temperature distribution in a gas turbine with only the temperatures of the gas and the cooling air and the surface heat-transfer coefficient known. This {{analysis was}} applied to determine the temperatures of a complete wheel of a conventional single-stage impulse exhaust-gas turbine. The temperatures were first calculated for {{the case of the}} turbine operating at design conditions of speed, gas flow, etc. and with only the customary cooling arising from exposure of the outer blade flange and one face of the rotor to the air. Calculations were next made for the case of fins applied to the outer blade flange and the rotor. Finally the effects of using part of the nozzles (from 0 to 40 percent) for supplying cooling air and the effects of varying the metal thermal conductivity from 12 to 260 Btu per hour per foot per degree <b>Farenheit</b> on the wheel temperatures were determined. The gas temperatures at the nozzle box used in the calculations ranged from 1600 F to 2000 F. The results showed that if more than a few hundred degrees of cooling of turbine blades are required other means than indirect cooling with fins on the rotor and outer blade flange would be necessary. The amount of cooling indicated for the type of finning used could produce some improvement in efficiency and a large increase in durability of the wheel. The results also showed that if a large difference is to exist between the effective temperature of the exhaust gas and that of the blade material, as must be the case with present turbine materials and the high exhaust-gas temperatures desired (2000 F and above), two alternatives are suggested: (a) If metal with a thermal conductivity comparable with copper is used, then the blade temperature can be reduced by strong cooling at both the blade tip and root. The center of the blade will be less than 2000 F hotter than the ends; (b) With low conductivity materials some method of direct cooling other than partial admission of cooling air is essential. From this study, it can be deduced that indirect cooling of turbine blades will not make possible large increases in gas temperature...|$|E
