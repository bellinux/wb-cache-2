5|$|Congress {{passed a}} new {{counterfeiting}} statute in 1816 when it created the Second Bank of the United States. In United States v. Turner (1833), interpreting the new act, the Court <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> offense of counterfeiting was committed {{even if the}} signatures forged were those of the wrong bank officers. But, in United States v. Brewster (1833), the Court <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> crime applied only to counterfeit bills, not counterfeit notes.|$|E

5|$|In United States v. Amedy (1826), the Court <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> federal {{criminal}} insurance fraud statute was no {{subjected to}} the same formalities as civil insurance fraud claims. First, the Court <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> state statute of incorporation of the insurance company required {{no more than the}} state's seal to be authenticated. Second, {{there was no need to}} prove the existence of the insurance company (i.e., that its stock had actually been subscribed) because it was not a party. Nor was it necessary to prove that the policy would have been binding against the insurance company. Nor did it matter whether the policy would have paid out under the circumstances of the fraud. Finally, it was held that an insurance corporation was a person within the meaning of the statute.|$|E
5|$|In United States v. Gooding (1827), the Court {{construed}} {{the elements}} of the fitting out offense.

Second, the Court <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> statute could be violated by a partial fitting out (as opposed to a complete fitting out) of a vessel for that purpose. Third, the Court held thatsince slave trading was a misdemeanorthere was no distinction between principal and accessory. Fourth, the Court held that, for the statute to be violated, the fitting out must have occurred within the United States. Finally, the Court <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> statute's mens rea required that the owner intend to cause the vessel to be used for slave trading, as opposed to intending that the vessel be used for slave trading (by some third party).|$|E

5|$|In the {{eleventh}} century, Ibn al-Haytham (Alhazen, 965–1040) rejected the Greek ideas about vision, whether the Aristotelian tradition that <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> {{form of the}} perceived object entered the eye (but not its matter), or that of Euclid and Ptolemy that <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> eye emitted a ray. Al-Haytham proposed in his Book of Optics that vision occurs by way of light rays forming a cone with its vertex {{at the center of}} the eye. He suggested that light was reflected from different surfaces in different directions, thus causing objects to look different. He argued further that the mathematics of reflection and refraction needed to be consistent with the anatomy of the eye.|$|E

5|$|The High Court <b>held</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Minister's {{order to}} {{prohibit}} all publications by WTBTS was not excessive.
