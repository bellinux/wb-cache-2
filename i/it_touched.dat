5|$|About {{five hours}} after the {{aircraft}} departed Andrews, <b>it</b> <b>touched</b> down at Naval Base Ventura County, Point Mugu, California. The public, including sailors from the USS Ronald Reagan, was there to witness the plane's arrival. Reagan's body was driven in a large motorcade on one final trip though the streets of southern California.|$|E
5|$|October 1968: The last {{storm to}} impact Arizona {{during the decade}} was Hurricane Pauline, which added high amounts of {{moisture}} ahead of a cold front in early October. The added instability in the atmosphere allowed the cold front to produce severe thunderstorms, including an F2 tornado that wrecked several homes and caused $250,000 (1968 USD) in damage when <b>it</b> <b>touched</b> down in Glendale.|$|E
5|$|On 15 September 2005, B-1B (s/n 85-0066) was {{extensively}} {{damaged by}} fire while landing at Andersen Air Force Base, Guam. The {{investigation into the}} incident concluded that leaking hydraulic fluid and sparks from a wheel being gouged caused a fire to start in the aircraft's right main landing gear as <b>it</b> <b>touched</b> down. The resulting fire damaged the B-1's right wing, engine nacelle, airframe and landing gear, leading to an estimated repair cost of more than $32million.|$|E

5|$|The Hamden tornado {{was by far}} {{the most}} {{destructive}} tornado of this family, and possibly the most damaging of the entire outbreak. <b>It</b> <b>touched</b> down at 5:38pm near the Wilbur Cross Parkway. Industrial cranes and cars were tossed through the air, and rows of houses, as well as an industrial park, were flattened. The tornado lifted just a few minutes later at 5:45. The damage path was only five miles long, stopping just short of the city of New Haven, but it damaged or destroyed almost 400 structures in its path.|$|E
5|$|The five UH-1 gunships {{immediately}} strafed Viet Cong {{positions with}} 2.75-inch rockets, {{but failed to}} suppress the enemy fire. After South Vietnamese soldiers had disembarked from the helicopters, one CH-21 was too severely damaged {{to get off the}} ground. A second CH-21 was sent to rescue the crew, but it too was immobilized as soon as <b>it</b> <b>touched</b> the ground. One of the Hueys returned to pick up the crews of the two downed CH-21s. As it prepared to land, the main rotor was struck by enemy gunfire. The aircraft flipped over to the right and crashed. Almost simultaneously, a third CH-21 sustained heavy damage and was forced to land on the rice fields a short distance from the first two helicopters. By 10:30, all the South Vietnamese soldiers who had landed on the field were under heavy fire from inside Ap Bac and refused to move. Sergeant Arnold Bowers, who had ridden in the first crashed helicopter, raced back and forth to rescue injured American airmen.|$|E
5|$|The strongest tornado in the United States during 2015 {{first began}} at 6:39p.m. CDT (23:39UTC) on April9, just {{northeast}} of Franklin Grove, Illinois. <b>It</b> <b>touched</b> down over a field, producing swirls in crops, before moving northeast and causing EF1 damage to Crest Foods plant. The tornado soon exited Lee County and entered Ogle County, inflicting EF1 damage to two farm outbuildings that were completely destroyed and EF0 {{damage to a}} similar structure that had a portion of its roof uplifted. Intensifying to EF3 strength, much more severe damage was noted along South Skare Court as the tornado entered an area of semi-rural subdivisions to the northwest of Rochelle. A few homes in this area were destroyed at EF3 intensity, with other homes nearby sustaining EF2 damage. One large house had a room ripped off on its second floor, while a split-level home was almost completely leveled.|$|E

5|$|A violent multiple-vortex tornado struck {{portions}} of extreme northern Georgia and southeast Tennessee during the mid-evening hours of April 27. <b>It</b> <b>touched</b> down along Davis Ridge Road in Catoosa County, Georgia, and {{moved through the}} town of Ringgold at EF3 strength, destroying numerous homes and businesses. A Baymont Inn & Suites, located near Interstate 75 was partially destroyed by the tornado, along with a McDonald's, a Taco Bell, and several gas stations located on Highway 151 in Ringgold at the Interstate 75 interchange (exit 348). The Catoosa County Department of Family and Children Services and other businesses on Nashville Street in downtown Ringgold were also heavily damaged. The Kellerhals Center for Visual Arts Education at Ringgold High School was destroyed (RHS itself had minor damage), and Ringgold Middle School was heavily damaged. Past downtown Ringgold, the tornado reached EF4 intensity as it tore through a subdivision along Cherokee Valley Road at the north edge of town. Twelve homes were completely obliterated and swept away at that location (though they were not well-built). There were 74 destroyed homes and/or businesses, 60 with major damage, and 118 with minor damage {{for a total of}} 252 affected structures in the Ringgold area. Eight people were killed, mainly at the subdivision along Cherokee Valley Road.|$|E
5|$|Del Piero {{was a free}} {{kick and}} penalty kick (62 goals from {{penalties}}) specialist. He is the third highest scorer of penalties in Serie A history, scoring 50 times out of 61 attempts, behind only Francesco Totti and Roberto Baggio. Del Piero's unique free kick technique was usually characterised by a curling strike which rose high over the wall, and then suddenly dropped into the top corner of the goal; he attributes his ability on set pieces to the time spent studying Roberto Baggio in training during their time together at Juventus, and was also influenced by the free kick technique {{of one of his}} idols, Platini. Indeed, in his early years with the Turin club, Del Piero's free kick technique was compared to that of the Frenchman, as he preferred to strike the ball from a distance of around 20 metres from the goal, with a direct kick, rather than having <b>it</b> <b>touched</b> by a teammate first. Del Piero is currently the Italian all-time top scorer from free kicks in all competitions (52 goals: 46 goals at club level, 6 goals with the Italy national team). He is also the third all-time highest goalscorer of free kicks in Serie A, with 22 goals, behind only Andrea Pirlo and Siniša Mihajlović. In addition to his talent and footballing abilities, Del Piero also drew praise throughout his career for his leadership with Juventus, and for his fair play and correct behaviour on the pitch.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was landing at Samara Kurumoch Airport, when <b>it</b> <b>touched</b> down about 400 meters {{short of a}} runway in heavy fog, bouncing and flipping over.

25|$|The 18th century {{witnessed}} {{three major}} changes in the production of Shakespeare's plays. In England, the development of the star system transformed both acting and production; {{at the end of the}} century, the Romantic revolution touched acting as <b>it</b> <b>touched</b> all the arts. At the same time, actors and producers began to return to Shakespeare's texts, slowly weeding out the Restoration revisions. Finally, by the end of the century Shakespeare's plays had been established as part of the repertory outside of Great Britain: not only in the United States but in many European countries.|$|E
25|$|The ball {{came very}} close to hitting the ground before Harris scooped it up.

The only other known NBC video was an end zone shot from above and behind the goalposts depicting Harris scooping the ball before <b>it</b> <b>touched</b> the ground. The best NFL Films shot of the play, from ground level, is a tight shot from the end zone of Harris snaring the ball, with his feet and the ground just out of frame below.|$|E

It left JFK for San Juan, Puerto Rico, at 01:07 am on August 2, 1970, with 359 or 360 passengers and 19 crew. At 02:47 am, {{a young man named}} R.Campos produced a gun and a bottle out of a bag that he claimed contained explosives, and hijacked the airplane to Havana, where <b>it</b> <b>touched</b> down at Jose Marti Airport at 05:31 am.

25|$|Thonemann {{continued}} {{working on}} the idea and began a rigorous programme to explore the basic physics of plasmas in a magnetic field. Starting with linear tubes and mercury gas, {{he found that the}} current tended to expand outward through the plasma until <b>it</b> <b>touched</b> the walls of the container (see skin effect). He countered this with the addition of small electromagnets outside the tube, which pushed back against the current and kept it centred. By 1949, he had moved on from the glass tubes to a larger copper torus, in which he was able to demonstrate a stable pinched plasma. Frederick Lindemann and Cockroft visited and were duly impressed.|$|E
