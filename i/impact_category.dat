30|$|A {{comprehensive}} set {{of environmental}} <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> was investigated {{to identify the}} most relevant <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> for the product.

The relationships between anthropogenic disturbance, aquatic macroinvertebrate species composition, and environmental variables at these springs have received little study. We selectively visited 40 sandstone springs in southeastern Utah and southwestern Colorado to span a range of impacts. We classified the springs into <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> based on a spring impact score, and we measured biodiversity (aquatic macroinvertebrates), water chemistry (nutrients, dissolved O 2, pH, specific conductivity, temperature, turbidity, coliform bacteria [Escherichia coli]), physical characters (solar radiation, substrate, vegetation cover, bank stability, discharge), and presence of anthropogenic disturbance. Escherichia coli abundance was higher in high <b>impact</b> <b>categories,</b> and turbidity increased with increasing disturbance. No differences in total N, total P, specific conductivity, flow, dissolved O 2, pH, or substrate were found among the <b>impact</b> <b>categories.</b> Vegetation cover was higher in low <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> than in moderate and high <b>impact</b> <b>categories,</b> while potential annual and growing-season solar radiation was lower in low <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> than in high <b>impact</b> <b>categories.</b> Global and subsequent multiple response permutation procedure (MRPP) comparisons suggested strong differences in aquatic macroinvertebrates between low and high impact springs and no difference at moderate impact springs. Mean taxa richness (α-diversity), total taxa richness (γ-diversity), and percent of taxa richness composed of shredders peaked at moderate disturbance levels. The percentage of non-insect taxa richness was reduced in high <b>impact</b> <b>categories,</b> and Odonata (dragonflies and damselflies) were higher in low <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> than in high <b>impact</b> <b>categories.</b> All high <b>impact</b> springs had both livestock use and vehicle use (roads or off-highway vehicles), and our data suggest that disturbances caused by one or both of these uses alter the aquatic macroinvertebrate assemblage.

40|$|We {{thank the}} members of the CEN TC WG 1 and WG 3, the EC-JRC and all experts {{involved}} for their valuable inputsThe European standards developed by CEN TC 350 for assessing the sustainability of construction works, i. e. EN 15804 (construction products) and EN 15978 (buildings), consider seven <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> within the life cycle assessment approach. When looking at commonly used Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA) methods (e. g. IMPACT 2002 + and ReCiPe) and the recently developed Product Environmental Footprint (PEF) of the European Commission, more <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> are included. Scientific studies indicate the necessity to consider these additional <b>impact</b> <b>categories.</b> The question arises if declaring solely the seven CEN TC 350 <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> is sufficient or if additional <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> should be taken up. In the context of this potential need for a broader environmental perspective, a new work item proposal within CEN TC 350 has been approved for drafting a CEN Technical Report (TR) containing an overview and evaluation of additional <b>impact</b> <b>categories.</b> The goal of the TR is to collect information on six impact categories: human toxicity, ecotoxicity, particulate matter, ionising radiation, land use/biodiversity and water scarcity. The TR can be used as input for further discussions on the need for updating the standards. The draft TR was finalised in January 2016 on the basis of literature study and feedback from experts, amongst others the EC-Joint Research Centre.

30|$|The {{environmental}} load of the ‘energy depletion’ <b>impact</b> <b>category</b> in the Chinese {{case study is}} lowest in scenario 2, mainly due to the avoided coal and oil for mineral fertilizer production.

30|$|The {{environmental}} load of the ‘energy depletion’ <b>impact</b> <b>category</b> in the Indian {{case study is}} lowest in scenario 1, second lowest in scenario 3, and highest in scenario 2. This is because electricity replaced by energy recovered in the incineration plant significantly reduced the consumption of coal and natural gas in the fossil-based fuel thermal power plant. The ‘global warming potential’ <b>impact</b> <b>category</b> is lowest in scenarios 2 and 3. This is mainly due to the biological processes in these scenarios which take out CH 4 from the global warming potential, {{as well as the}} subsequent conversion of this gas into electricity. The ‘acid rain’ <b>impact</b> <b>category,</b> which consists of NOx and SO 2 as indicators, has the lowest impact in scenario 2, second lowest in scenario 3, and highest in scenario 1. The biggest contribution is from the avoided NOx emission from the production of mineral fertilizer. The ‘resource consumption’ <b>impact</b> <b>category,</b> which has Fe, Ni, Sn, Al 2 O 3, Au, and Ag as indicators, has the lowest {{environmental load}} in scenario 3, followed by scenarios 2 and 1, as the amount of fertilizer produced by anaerobic digestion replaces the production of mineral fertilizer. The ‘air pollution’ <b>impact</b> <b>category</b> has the lowest environmental load in scenario 1, followed by scenarios 2 and 3, especially because of the NOx emission from the biogas and landfill gas cogeneration units. The ‘waste disposal’ <b>impact</b> <b>category</b> is highest in scenario 1 because the amount of inert material contained in Indian municipal waste produces significant amounts of slag and residues.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to perform}} comparative impact assessment for production of conventional aluminum alloy (AlMg 3) used in aircraft fuselage and lighter weight carbon-fiber reinforced polymer (CFRP). The epoxy resin (EP), a thermosetting polymer typically impregnated with carbon fiber (CF) tows {{is assumed to}} be replaced by polypropylene (PP) which is a thermoplastic polymer. The assessment framework is demonstrated by postulating a scenario where AlMg 3 in Boeing B 737 - 800 fuselage is substituted with CFRP to reduce the fuselageweight by about 4. 3 tons. OpenLCA 1. 4. 2 platform, including Ecoinvent v 2. 2 life cycle inventory (LCI) database and TRACE 2. 1 methodology for life cycle impact assessment (LCIA), is used to quantify and compare mid-point <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> of the AlMg 3 -based scenario and the postulated base case scenario using CFRP (53. 8 wt% CF). The CF content in CFRP is used as a sensitivity parameter for <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> calculations. The assessment results showed that AlMg 3 -based scenario leads to higher <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> compared to the postulated CFRP (53. 8 wt% CF) base case scenario. Additionally, results of the performed scenario analysis show ≈ 42 % reduction in energy intensity associated with the high-volume CFRP production (base case scenario) compared to the low-volume production scenario. All calculated <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> associated with the low-volume production scenario exceed the corresponding <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> associated with the high-volume production (base case scenario). For example, ozone depletion potential (ODP) for the low-volume production scenario is ≈ 20. 7 % higher than that of the high-volume production scenario and global warming potential (GWP) for the low-volume production scenario is ≈ 10. 2 % higher than that of the high-volume production scenario. This research also compares <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> associated with recycled CF (rCF) from end-of-life (EOL) CFRP (with PP resin matrix) to those corresponding to rCF from EOL-CFRP (with EP resin matrix). Overall, the results of this research support its alternative hypothesis (H 1) which claims that replacing PE with PP in CFRP reduces the energy intensity and LCIA <b>impact</b> <b>categories</b> associated with CFRP production as well as rCF from EOL-CFRP. Finally, replacing fuselage’s AlMg 3 with CFRP in Boeing’s new aircraft fleet by 2035 (Boeing Market Outlook 2016 – 2035) will lead to an estimated global carbon footprint reduction of ≈ 1 x 10 ^ 6 tons CO 2 eq.
