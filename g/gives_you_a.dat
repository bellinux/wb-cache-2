As Hail to the Thief was the last album released on Radiohead's six-album contract with EMI, the band had no contractual obligation to release new material. Drummer Philip Selway said: [...] "It was definitely {{time to take a}} break.

500|$|Rivera had an {{impeccable}} {{ability to}} accurately locate pitches and consistently throw strikes, {{particularly on the}} inside and outside edges of the strike zone. This strength offset his reliance on one pitch and hitters' anticipation of it. His former catcher Joe Girardi said, [...] "He was so easy to catch because he always put the ball right there. I don't think there's ever been a pitcher that great who was so easy to catch." [...] Rivera's 4.10 career strikeout-to-walk ratio in the regular season ranks ninth-best in major league history. His control was a byproduct of his smooth, easily repeated pitching motion, which some opposing hitters found to be deceptive. One such player, Darrin Fletcher, said in 1999 that Rivera [...] "almost kind of lulls you to sleep with his delivery. It <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> false sense of security, and then the ball is on you and it's exploding." ...|$|E

500|$|Stone {{wanted to}} shoot the movie in New York City and that {{required}} a budget of at least $15 million, a moderate shooting budget by 1980s standards. The studio that backed Platoon {{felt that it was}} too risky a project to bankroll and passed. Stone and producer Edward R. Pressman took it to 20th Century Fox and filming began in April 1987 and ended on July 4 of the same year. According to Stone, he was [...] "making a movie about sharks, about feeding frenzies. Bob [...] and I wanted the camera to become a predator. There is no letup until you get to the fixed world of Charlie’s father, where the stationary camera <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> sense of immutable values".

500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{revelation of}} Danielle's identity {{was set at}} Archie's wedding to Peggy (Barbara Windsor), matriarch of the Mitchell family. Crace deemed the wedding [...] "the perfect opportunity" [...] for the storyline to conclude, and Santer explained: [...] "Weddings are great because they bring the community together. A wedding <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> stage, it gives you an event, the context to play things out, so it felt right that these big Mitchell stories would collide at Peggy's wedding." [...] Writer James Payne concurred that setting the reveal at the wedding helped to make the moment [...] "as dramatic and sensational" [...] as it could possibly be. The episode saw Danielle announce that she was Ronnie's daughter {{in front of the}} entire wedding reception party, in what Crace has named her favourite scene on the show. She opined that the disbelief Danielle was faced with was [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and served to highlight the fact that [...] "she came as the outsider and she still is the outsider because no one steps in to help her".|$|E

[...] Ralph Novak of People complained [...] "The ads that say 'this film may be too intense for younger children' are fraudulent. No parent should allow a young child to see this traumatizing movie; it would be a cinematic form of child abuse. Even Harrison Ford is required to slap Quan and abuse Capshaw. There are no heroes connected with the film, only two villains; their names are Steven Spielberg and George Lucas." [...] The Observer described it as [...] "a thin, arch, graceless affair." [...] The Guardian summarized it as [...] "a two-hour series of none too carefully linked chase sequences ... {{sitting on the edge of}} your seat <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> sore bum but also a numb brain."

500|$|Coppola's {{first three}} films examine {{feminine}} self-definition and maturation, usually in privileged circumstance. Lost in Translation (2003) depicts an encounter and brief friendship between two lonely Americans in a luxurious Tokyo hotel; Marie Antoinette (2006), a stylized biopic of the eponymous queen, examined her loneliness. Somewhere examines similar themes {{of success and}} isolation, but from a male perspective. The film explores Marco's seclusion and depression despite his outward professional success and the resulting wealth and fame. He appears to suffer from anhedonia, the inability to feel pleasure, but the film itself is reticent in suggesting its causes. [...] "He believes he's nothing", summarized film critic Roger Ebert, [...] "and it appears he's correct". The film's opening shot, a Ferrari circling a race-track {{in and out of}} a stationary camera position, its whine and roar rising and falling, establishes the theme of ennui. The sequence's length also offers a visual cue from Coppola to relax, observe and withhold expectations. Coppola said she wanted to hint at this with a simple camera set-up, [...] "so you're alone with this guy and not aware that it's a movie. But I hope it's a welcome contrast to the style of most movies out there. Something that <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> chance to take a breath".|$|E
500|$|Variety {{was added}} to the city itself, as certain areas were {{designed}} around the villains that control that particular territory. Dax Ginn, marketing game manager at Rocksteady Games, said, [...] "If you move into Joker's territory, you get a very Joker-ized experience, and all the artwork on the buildings– whether that's graffiti, signage, or whatever it might be– <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> dense kind of Joker experience. So our art team has really put a lot of effort in making that sort of transition between one turf zone to another– really helping the player feel like they're making a physical transition into another emotional space." [...] The architecture was imbued with 19th century Art Nouveau design, such as Strange's Wonder Tower which was inspired by the Eiffel Tower, while character designs employed a modern Hyperrealism style. To keep the environments interesting, base color schemes such as Mr Freeze's ice-themed area, Joker's fire-themed steel mill, and Poison Ivy's jungle-themed area were populated with contrasting elements: for example, the steel mill uses large, white clown faces to contrast the oranges and reds used throughout. To develop the expanded environment of Arkham City and build a [...] "natural urban environment" [...] for Batman, Rocksteady expanded its workforce from 75 to over 100 people.|$|E

It was all quite surreal. I still think Kylie's people were trying to call Jamelia, and they just got the wrong number. It'd be much more funny if that is how it actually happened". Musically, the song is an eighties-inspired synthpop track. It utilises a very simple and [...] "minimalist" [...] style of production and was described as an [...] "electro-pop/disco fusion with percolating crackle-and-pop beats and sugary vocal overdubs" [...] by Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine. Additionally, it contains elements of electroclash and club music. Through the lyrics of the song, Minogue urges a man, whom she meets at a club, to [...] "slow down" [...] and dance with her. According to Minogue, the lyrics of the song are about [...] " [...] how time and space have a different meaning when you meet someone".

Midfielder Stewart Downing was awarded the Alan Hardaker Trophy as {{the man of the}} match.

500|$|In 2009, Beckinsale {{starred in}} the comic-book {{adaption}} Whiteout as a U.S.Marshal tasked with investigating a murder in Antarctica. It was filmed in Manitoba, Canada. She found the action scenes less physically demanding than those in Underworld because [...] "three pairs of trousers and a parka <b>gives</b> <b>you</b> <b>a</b> bit more protection than the latex suit." [...] The film was critically panned and a box office failure, failing to recoup its budget. With critics consensus: Beckinsale is the lovely as ever, and does her best with the material, but moribund pacing and an uninspired plot leave Whiteout in the cold. She also made a brief cameo in the prequel she appeared in flashforwards composed of footage from 2003's Underworld. Also in 2009, Beckinsale {{starred in the}} family drama Everybody's Fine alongside Robert De Niro, Drew Barrymore, and Rockwell, her Snow Angels co-star. Beckinsale was excited by {{the opportunity to work}} with De Niro, whom she had first encountered [...] "years and years ago when I just had Lily and he was putting together a reading of The Good Shepherd.". Everybody's Fine was a box office flop, failing to recoup its production budget. In May 2010, Beckinsale sat on the nine-member 2010 Cannes Film Festival jury, chaired by director Tim Burton. Unable to find a script she felt passionate about, Beckinsale kept a low profile in 2010 and 2011, opting to spend time with her daughter.|$|E

He also enjoyed the [...] "fleshing out" [...] of Gus's character, that [...] "we now see Gus as quite the brainiac" [...] and [...] "rather than saying nothing but 'No, Shawn'...
