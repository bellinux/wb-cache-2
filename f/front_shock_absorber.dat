40|$|Abstract—The {{objective}} of this work {{is to develop a}} new testing and analysis methodology to obtain the nonlinear characteristics of an automotive shock absorber. The <b>front</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> on a Mazda CX- 7 was tested on the single-post shaker test bench. The shock absorber piston velocity test range is between 0. 01 m/s and 1. 3 m/s, corresponding to typical velocities of a vehicle suspension generated by road irregularities. Three shock absorber models were built and validated using experimental shock absorber data. The power function model and polynomial model accurately capture the nonlinear characteristics of a shock absorber and can be quickly fit to experimental data for use in vehicle simulations. The influence of the shock absorber models on vehicle dynamics in vertical direction was analyzed. Index Terms—shock absorber, nonlinearity, vehicle dynamics. I...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{a method to}} analyse the dynamics of passenger cars with McPherson strut suspension systems, which {{will make it possible}} to consider the friction that takes place between major components, i. e. piston rod and cylinder, of <b>front</b> <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers.</b> The analysis was carried out with making use of modern tools to support the engineering design process, i. e. the Autodesk Inventor program (used to work out geometric models of the car under consideration), and the MSC. ADAMS software (in the environment of which the dynamics of the structural model of the car under consideration was analysed). The analysis included investigation of the tendency exhibited by a car to have variations in the distribution of car body weight among road wheels at sudden lane-change manoeuvres, {{especially in the case of}} previous severe defect (oil outflow) of one of the car <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers</b> as a result of which the <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> would fail to function fully. In such a situation, dry friction may occur between mating parts of the defective <b>shock</b> <b>absorbers,</b> which would impede (or even prevent) relative translational motion of the parts.

40|$|The use {{of modern}} control theory to produce an {{electrical}} motor simulation of a Formula 1, Grand Pnx, passive motorcycle <b>front</b> suspension <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> is investigated. It is shown, using a test-rig comprising two permanent magnet DC motors directly coupled, that desired <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> responses to load forces can be achieved using model reference control. The controller feedback in this test rig is provided via a high resolution rotary position sensor. A stochastic Kalman filter is used to produce estimates of the load(disturbance), force and velocity from this position information. All states are then used in the controller. A mass, spring and damper model is chosen as a suitable representation of a <b>shock</b> <b>absorber,</b> and is assumed sufficiently complex to justify the control techniques used. This linear model is translated using mathematical techniques into a rotary equivalent that is compatible {{for use in the}} controller. This translation takes into account thermal effects, as well as kinematic requirements encountered by the motor on the basis of load-force data taken from the front suspension of a Formula 1 motorcycle in race conditions. The parameters of the mass spring and damper model are found from simple static tests using the <b>shock</b> <b>absorber</b> removed from the bike...|$|R
