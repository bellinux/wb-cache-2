5|$|The {{party is}} unable to heal Sophie with magic or {{medicine}} so Pascal suggests the party travel to Fodra, a nearby planet, where Sophie originates from to find a cure. After finding a space shuttle left by Pascal's ancestors, the party travel to Fodra where they meet <b>Emeraude,</b> the last remaining human on the desolated planet. Using advanced machinery, Sophie is healed and regains her memories revealing she is a biological humanoid engineered to defeat Lambda, the monster that attacked them in their childhood and is currently possessing Richard. <b>Emeraude</b> helps the party bypass the barrier on the Lastalia where they confront and defeat Richard. <b>Emeraude</b> betrays the party and attempts to absorb Lambda's power but dies in the process. Lambda begins to fuse with the Lastalia causing the party to see his memories and learn about his suffering caused by humanity. The party defeats the materialized Lambda; Since Lambda can not be killed by normal means, Sophie intends to sacrifice herself to kill him. Instead, Asbel absorbs and convinces Lambda to let him show humanity's worth. Lambda agrees before falling into a deep sleep.|$|E

Most systems during the season remained weak, with only three storms (Uriah, <b>Emeraude,</b> and Fantala) reaching at least tropical cyclone strength with winds of 120km/h (75mph), compared to the average of five. However, the season featured Cyclone Fantala, which became the strongest tropical cyclone on record in the basin in terms of 10-minute sustained winds at 250km/h (155mph).|$|E
25|$|As {{with the}} <b>Emeraude,</b> Piel {{obtained}} type certification for the Diamant, {{allowing it to}} be manufactured on a commercial basis. However, unlike the <b>Emeraude,</b> this did not actually transpire, and the Diamant was only ever built as a homebuilt.|$|E

25|$|The Diamant is a conventional, low-wing {{cantilever}} monoplane {{and essentially}} an enlarged version of Piel's successful <b>Emeraude</b> {{designed to accommodate}} more passengers. This extra capacity is provided by a redesigned fuselage which is higher in the rear section and longer overall. While the <b>Emeraude</b> has only two seats, side-by-side, the Diamant has an extra bench seat {{at the rear of}} the cabin to seat one or two more people. The wingspan is also greater than that of the <b>Emeraude,</b> allowing for a greater maximum take-off weight. The 110 page set of plans included modifications for retractable gear, tricycle gear, and wing mounted fuel tanks.|$|E
25|$|The Scintex {{version of}} the <b>Emeraude</b> was the {{standard}} design with upward-opening cabin doors. From 1960 the CP.301C version was introduced, and this incorporated a single-piece clearview sliding canopy.|$|E
2500|$|Punk rock {{had arisen}} in the 1970s and {{continued}} into the next decade, perhaps best represented by Oberkampf and Métal Urbain. [...] 80s progressive rock peaked early in the decade, with Dun's Eros, <b>Emeraude's</b> Geoffroy and Terpandre's Terpandre, all from 1981, representing the genre's pinnacle.|$|R
25|$|With {{the lack}} of sales success with the Rubis, Scintex {{abandoned}} aircraft production in late 1964. At the same time, the firm subcontracted construction of all Super <b>Emeraudes</b> to CAARP at Beynes-Thiverval airfield near Paris and in due course CAARP built the aircraft in its own right.|$|R
50|$|Piel later {{moved to}} CAARP (Cooperatives des Ateliers Aéronautiques de la Region Parisienne). In 1965, CAARP {{was set up}} by Auguste Mudry, principally as a design bureau using the skills of Piel, Nenad Hrissatovic and Louis de Goncourt. The company {{originally}} built CP1310-C3 Super <b>Emeraudes,</b> and went on to make the CP100 and CAP10 derivatives.|$|R
25|$|Scintex {{was formed}} in 1956 by Jean-Michel Vernhes and a {{production}} line was established to build the Piel CP.301 <b>Emeraude,</b> designed by Claude Piel, initially as the CP.30, under licence for French club and private owners.|$|E
25|$|Claude Piel, who {{had worked}} for SCANOR (Societe de Constructions Aeronautiques du Nord), which built Emeraudes, joined Scintex in 1959 and the company {{introduced}} the CP.1310 Super <b>Emeraude</b> which first flew on 20 April 1962 and incorporated a strengthened airframe for elementary aerobatics and a generally cleaned-up layout. The majority of the Scintex Emeraudes and Super Emeraudes were built at the Menavia factory at Clermont-Ferrand, but the CP.320 version was intended for construction by amateurs.|$|E
500|$|In 1986, l'aéroclub du Boulonnais {{took over}} Saint-Inglevert {{following}} closure {{of their previous}} base at Ambleteuse. Since its closure, the runway had {{been used as a}} dump for old tyres and scrap vehicles, and it took three years to restore the airfield, which reopened on 30 July 1989. On the night of 5–6 April 2010, a fire in a hangar at Saint-Inglevert destroyed the hangar and eight aircraft. The destroyed aircraft were replaced by a Robin DR300, a Robin DR400, a Piel <b>Emeraude</b> CP3005 and a Jodel D195. A Piper PA-28 was also acquired which needed restoration to make it airworthy. The replacement aircraft were housed in a [...] tent hangar erected on the airfield, or temporarily outstationed at Calais or Le Touquet. A new [...] hangar, replacing the one destroyed by the fire, was officially opened on 30 March 2012, and can accommodate ten aircraft. Following the fire, a NOTAM was issued temporarily restricting the use of the airfield until 15 November 2010 to aircraft based there. On 26 August 2010, Saint-Inglevert was given the ICAO identifier LFIS, allowing it to be classed as a public airfield instead of a private one. This had taken ten years to achieve.|$|E

50|$|<b>Emeraudes</b> {{were also}} {{produced}} in the United Kingdom (by Fairtravel as the Linnet) and in South Africa by General Aircraft ("Genair") of Virginia Airport as the Aeriel 2 with imported engines, the first aircraft to be manufactured entirely in that country. The Linnet was modified by the Garland Aircraft Company, formed by P.A.T Garland and D.E. Bianchi, to meet British airworthiness requirements. The first aircraft (G-APNS) was built at White Waltham and first flown on 1 September 1958 by Squadron Leader Neville Duke. Two more aircraft were planned but only one more was built by Garland-Bianchi in 1962. Between 1963 and 1965 three more aircraft were built with 100-hp Rolls Royce Continental O-200-A engines. The last two aircraft had one-piece sliding cockpit canopies.|$|R
50|$|The {{second part}} of the series deals with the {{complications}} caused by Princess <b>Emeraude's</b> death. Set a year later, it opens with the three protagonists struggling with their guilt and despair over their role in her death. Meeting again at Tokyo Tower, they find themselves transported mysteriously to Cephiro again, and discover that only a single piece of Cephiro remains, which holds a castle where the survivors gather to take refuge. With the Pillar gone, Cephiro is, for the most part, defenseless, and the girls are saddened to learn that a new Pillar must be chosen by the Pillar system before the whole planet is destroyed. Three warring planets begin their attempts to conquer Cephiro: Autozam, a technologically advanced world which intends to use the Pillar system to remove the pollution in its air; Fahren, whose childish ruler Lady Aska plans {{to turn it into a}} world of her whims; and Chizeta, an overpopulated world whose sibling rulers Tatra and Tarta see Cephiro as a potential colony.|$|R

2500|$|The modern English word [...] "emerald" [...] comes via Middle English <b>Emeraude,</b> {{imported}} from Old French Ésmeraude and Medieval Latin Esmaraldus, from Latin smaragdus, from Greek σμάραγδος smaragdos meaning ‘green gem’, from Hebrew ברקת bareket (one {{of the twelve}} stones in the Hoshen pectoral pendant of the Kohen HaGadol), meaning ‘lightning flash’, referring to ‘emerald’, relating to Akkadian baraqtu, meaning ‘emerald’, and possibly relating to the Sanskrit word मरकत marakata, meaning ‘green’.
