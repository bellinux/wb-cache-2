Consequently, this kind of top-down planning will leave communities, enterprises and ultimately workers with a significant level of freedom to decide their own economic future (see <b>decentralized</b> <b>planning</b> [...] ).|$|E

50|$|An {{economic}} system consisting of self-managed enterprises is {{sometimes referred to}} as a participatory economy, self-managed economy or cooperative economy. This economic model is a major version of market socialism and <b>decentralized</b> <b>planned</b> economy, stemming from the notion that people should be able to participate in making the decisions that affect their well-being. The major proponents of self-managed market socialism in the 20th century include the economists Benjamin Ward, Jaroslav Vanek and Branko Horvat. The Ward-Vanek model of self-management involves the diffusion of entrepreneurial roles amongst all the partners of the enterprise.|$|R
