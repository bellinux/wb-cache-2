Mohandar, however, believed <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> Zamara was going – Ehlna, a Nerazim sanctuary moon. There, the Nerazim, who had no preservers, used modified khaydarin crystals to store memories.|$|E
5|$|On {{the night}} of November 1, 1824, Desha {{attended}} a celebration at a neighbor's house. He later stayed the night at Doggate's Tavern in Fairview, just over the county line in Fleming County. The next morning, he ate breakfast at the tavern, joined by eight other men, including Francis Baker. Editor of the Mississippian newspaper in Natchez, Baker was returning to his hometown of Trenton, New Jersey to marry a young woman there. Over breakfast, Baker mentioned wanting to visit a friend, Captain John Bickley, {{who lived in the}} area. Desha remarked that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> Bickley lived and, intending to ride in that direction, asked if Baker wanted to join him. Baker accepted, and the two men left about 8 a.m. toward Maysville. Desha rode his bay mare and Baker his gray mare, a fine horse that had already attracted much attention during his travel through Kentucky.|$|E

25|$|It {{is presumed}} {{that he was}} {{disposing}} of his belongings throughout the town of Sligo and then folding the bag and putting it in his pocket. Authorities were unable to identify what he was throwing away in the public rubbish bins as the man used the blind spots of the surveillance cameras to his advantage. His movements were very meticulous and methodical as if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> to hide his personal belongings that could have identified him.|$|E

He asked if she knew whether or not her husband was okay, and when she did not answer, Bryant then told her he was okay and that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> her husband was.|$|E
25|$|A goalkeeper {{can also}} try to {{distract}} the taker by talking to them prior to the penalty being taken. Netherlands national team goalkeeper Tim Krul used this technique during the penalty shootout in the quarter-final match of the 2014 FIFA World Cup against Costa Rica. As the Costa Rican players were preparing to take the kick, Krul told them that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> {{they were going to}} put their penalty in order to get in their heads. This resulted in him saving two penalties and the Netherlands winning the shootout 4-3.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the Colonist leaving, Sydney Weaver had endeavoured {{to induce}} {{a friend of}} his to visit an island with him. Weaver related an {{extraordinary}} tale of hidden wealth on the island which was known only to him. The vessel cleared ostensibly for the Christmas Islands with no cargo and only a quantity of spades and firearms on board.

25|$|Jerry Atkins, Booker's band leader, had {{arranged}} with the girl's parents {{to take her}} to and from the dances, taking turns with bandmate Ernie Holcomb. It was Holcomb's turn that night, but he said Booker told him that she had a ride with an old friend. Atkins was awakened the next morning at 6:00 with a telephone call. It was a female asking if <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> Booker was. He had no knowledge of Booker's change of plans and told the caller that Holcomb took her home, but he was informed she had been expected at a party but never came. Atkins received a similar call around 8:00 from another girl, and he asked if she had checked with Booker's parents. This girl told him that Booker had gone with a friend named Paul but neither had attended the party.|$|E

500|$|He learned {{baseball}} at {{an early}} age, his biggest rival being Juan González, whom he often played against in his youth. As a Little League player and just 8 years old, he moved from pitcher and third baseman(his favorite position) to catcher because his father, who was also his coach, thought he was throwing too hard and scaring opposing players with his pitches. Rodríguez attended Lino Padron Rivera High School, where he was discovered by scout Luis Rosa. Rosa reported that [...] "He showed leadership at 16 that I'd seen in few kids. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> he was going." [...] Rodríguez {{signed a contract with}} the Texas Rangers in July 1988, at the age of 16, and began his professional baseball career.|$|E
500|$|On May 30, 2010—five {{years to}} the day after Holloway's disappearance—Stephany Flores Ramírez, a 21-year-old {{business}} student, was reported missing in Lima, Peru. She was found dead three days later in a hotel room registered in Van der Sloot's name. On June 3, Van der Sloot was arrested in Chile on a murder charge and extradited to Peru the next day. On June 7, Peruvian authorities said that Van der Sloot confessed to killing Flores after he lost his temper because she accessed his laptop without permission and found information linking him to Holloway. Police chief César Guardia related that Van der Sloot told Peruvian police that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> Holloway's body was and offered to help Aruban authorities find it. However, Guardia stated that the interrogation was limited to their case in Peru, and that questions about Holloway's disappearance were avoided. On June 11, Van der Sloot was charged in Lima Superior Court with first-degree murder and robbery. On June 15, Aruban and Peruvian authorities announced an agreement to cooperate and allow investigators from Aruba to interview Van der Sloot at Miguel Castro Castro prison in Peru. In a September 2010 interview from the prison, Van der Sloot reportedly admitted to the extortion plot, stating: [...] "I wanted to get back at Natalee's family—her parents have been making my life tough for five years." [...] On January 11, 2012, Van der Sloot pleaded guilty to murdering Ramírez and was sentenced to 28 years in prison.|$|E

500|$|Another major rivalry {{heading into}} the event was between Shawn Michaels and Chris Masters. This feud began the night after SummerSlam, where Michaels lost a match to Hulk Hogan. Michaels {{admitted}} he fell victim to Hogan's leg drop, a move where Hogan drops his legs across the opponent's head or chest. He concluded that Hogan was the better man {{and it was time}} to get [...] "back to reality". Midway through Michaels' speech, Masters interrupted him and informed Michaels that individuals like Hogan and Michaels did not know how to pass the torch to new wrestlers. Michaels went along with Masters' comments and warned Masters to not group him with Hogan. Masters concluded by stating that he was not [...] "trying" [...] to steal the spotlight from Michaels, but that he was going to [...] "take it". Michaels responded by saying that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> Masters was coming from, which led to Michaels slapping Masters. The two then brawled, thus turning Michaels into an on-screen hero, as he had been a villain in rivalry between Hogan. On the September 5 episode of Raw, Michaels was involved in the Masterlock Challenge, a challenge where the wrestler must break free from Master's full Nelson submission hold, which he calls the Master Lock. Despite Michaels' best efforts, he could not break free. Upset at the vigorous resistance of Michaels, Masters released the hold and hit Michaels with a steel chair before re-applying the hold. The following week, Michaels issued a challenge to Masters at Unforgiven, in which he vowed to get revenge on Masters for his actions the previous week.|$|E

We set up a lot of plays for him. <b>He</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> he was going, <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> the screen was coming. He was not playing {{one-on-one}} basketball. He was playing set-up basketball. I would say he is one of our all-time greats. And the longevity of his career as a shooter will prove it. The records he gave Philippine basketball as a shooter will be hard to beat." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to al Rehaief's {{version of}} the {{events leading up to}} Lynch's rescue, he walked six miles to a US Marine {{checkpoint}} to inform American forces that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> Lynch was being held.

2500|$|Ramsay {{compares the}} {{numerous}} legends {{related to the}} life and death of Lafitte to those about King Arthur and Robin Hood. Lafitte is rumored to have buried treasure at many locations, including Galveston and sites along coastal Louisiana, such as Contraband Bayou in Lake Charles. Ramsay believes that over time, almost [...] "every foot of Grande Isle has been spaded for pirate gold". In 1909, a man was given a six-year prison sentence for fraud after swindling thousands of dollars from people, by claiming that <b>he</b> <b>knew</b> <b>where</b> the Lafitte treasure was buried and taking their money for the promise to find it.|$|E
