50|$|To {{maintain}} their self-esteem, and protect their vulnerable true selves, narcissists {{need to control}} others' behavior - particularly that of their children seen as extensions of themselves. Thus narcissistic parents may speak of carrying the torch, maintaining the family image, or making mother or father proud and may reproach their children for exhibiting weakness, being too dramatic, or not meeting the standard of what is expected. As a result, children of narcissists learn to play their part and to perform their special skill, especially in public or for others; but typically do not have many memories of having felt loved or appreciated <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>themselves,</b> rather associating their experience of love and appreciation with conforming {{to the demands of}} the narcissistic parent.|$|E
40|$|Commentary "We {{have found}} little to {{indicate}} that indiscriminately promoting self-esteem in today’s children or adults, just <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>themselves,</b> offers society any compensatory benefits beyond the seductive pleasure it brings to those engaged in the exercise. (Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger, & Vohs, 2005) " In June this year, Wellesley High School became a focus of attention worldwide, following a graduation speech made by {{a teacher at the}} school. Departing from the traditional rhetoric of such ceremonies, English teacher David McCullough told the assembled graduates that they were neither special nor exceptional, but may well believe they were because they had been ‘pampered, cosseted, doted upon, helmeted, and bubble-wrapped, feted and fawned over’, an effect, he argued, of Americans’ ‘love of accolades more than genuine achievement’ (Christakis, 2012, p. 1). This assertion struck a chord not only in his home country, but more widely in the Western world, with many educators, childcare workers and parents experiencing a sense of unease {{about the extent to which}} this claim was justifiable, and if so, what sort of corrective might be needed...|$|E
40|$|Starting {{with recent}} social theory {{accounts}} of individualisation, detraditionalisation and how governmentality discourses around enterprise and personal responsibility have shaped young people’s lives, the research examines the experiential nature of contemporary identity and ‘unmapped’ transitions to adulthood. Using in-depth interviews with 20 ‘twentysomethings’ graduates from southeast England it traces negotiations of leaving fulltime education and entering a labour market buoyed by pre-economic crisis optimism whereby they feel overwhelmed with opportunities, choice and uncertainty. Through narrative analysis the thesis charts the struggles and anxieties {{generated by the}} ambiguous structural position capitalism casts them into but which ‘demands’ enterprise and adaptability. Their circumstances, however, deny certainty or secure paths forward and generate existential trouble and, for some, mental pathologies as insecurity and self-doubt prevail. The thesis explores how after university individual expectations met indecision and uncertainty. Resulting anxiety was offset through ‘falling’ into jobs, ‘drifting’ and avoiding getting ‘stuck’ in ‘dangerous places’. Twentysomethings, without a secure profession or sense of security, developed new work values: either seeing it as a site of potential to realize themselves or rejecting it; preferring autonomy and authenticity outside of that domain. Identifying ‘critical moments’ in narratives showed how these could liberate desire but also subsume individual subjectivity to new forms of capitalist regulation. Lastly, it explores how ‘strategies’ of thinking uncertainty can stifle individual agency and ‘thinking too much’ generates emotional ambiguities, impeding decision-making compared to those that viewed uncertainty as a positive opportunity. These negotiations testify to the intensification of subjective difficulties in late capitalism and compromise a future-oriented, meaningful self that can adequately withstand them. Presumptions of cognitive responses to uncertainty are misplaced as ‘internal ambiguities’ arising from the weight of responsibility individuals now have <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>themselves</b> demonstrate the need to think and understand the contemporary self beyond the rigidity of (economic) rationalism.

40|$|The author {{reflects}} {{on the issue of}} the value of human life in the contexts of current “posthuman” era. There is a host of evidence that the value of human <b>for</b> human <b>beings</b> <b>themselves</b> has been radically reduced or ignored, or replaced by other non-human values, and even neglected. The axiological crisis of humanity, as envisioned by Nietzsche, has become the existential and moral crisis of humanity today. No matter how contemporary technological culture challenges the traditional values, the ancient questions of “how to live?”, “what makes us happy?”, and “what makes life significant?” are still here with us and provide even greater challenges to every individual. The author points to pluralist ways of how to deal with these questions including the “stoic pragmatism” among them...|$|R
40|$|This project {{explores the}} {{representation}} of teenagers {{in some of the}} most popular Young Adult Fiction (YA) books of the early 2010 s. A dominant assumption within the scholarly discussion of YA is that YA books are books for young people that feature protagonists with whom young people personally identify. Through an analysis of nine American YA books, this thesis offers an overview of the sorts of protagonists often found in the novels on New Zealand’s YA bestseller lists. Reporting results from a questionnaire and one-on-one interviews conducted with young YA readers, it explores whether or not this model of being a teenager is one with which young people do actually identify. Using Erving Goffman’s 1959 theory of impression management as a lens, this thesis explores how the protagonists of the selected novels see their world as a stage upon which they are expected to act out socially acceptable roles. While female protagonists use strategies to meet this pressure and emerge as competent social actors, male protagonists find themselves governed by forces beyond their control that render them social aliens. Whereas female protagonists face negative consequences <b>for</b> <b>being</b> <b>themselves,</b> male protagonists are rewarded for doing so. Regardless of their acting ability, all protagonists are represented as confused, insecure and troubled. The selected texts thus support stereotypes about teenage girls, teenage boys and young people in general that differ from those of the past but are ultimately no less problematic. The participants in this project’s small mixed-methods study shared this view of the protagonists but did not generally identify with them. While they enjoyed reading these books, this was not necessarily because of the protagonists, for whom they felt more concern than empathy. Rather than reflecting any kind of ‘truth’ about what it means to be a teenager, it seems that the protagonists of the selected texts reflect how adult authors, editors and booksellers imagine teenagers to be. This is a significant finding given the rising numbers of adults who are reading YA and the declining numbers of teenagers who are reading for pleasure...|$|E
40|$|This {{articles}} discusses {{aspects of}} female labour in the strategies developed by farming families from Minas {{so as to}} ensure both access to and permanence in farmlands. Case studies {{have been carried out}} in two communities- one of which being an old constitution, Boa Vista, in Itaguara, MG, the other being a newly consituted unit, Assentamento Dom Orione, in Betim, MG- where it was possible to observe the importance of women’s role with their struggle and labor in the composition of family strategies. The Boa Vista community has been experiencing changes in the families’ production dynamics due to the decline in income from farming activities, causing handcraft work to gain greater and greater economic importance. Such activity involves all family members, but it is the women who outstand for coordinating the related activities and <b>for</b> <b>being,</b> <b>themselves,</b> the artisans, the connoisseurs of the office. The new importance of handcraft work done in loomshas redefined gender relations {{in and out of the}} family nucleus. However, that does not bring deeper changes in cultural patterns. In spite of modifying men and women, they not only keep, but also reaffirm gender relations, female subordination included. As for the life history of the families from Assentamento Dom Orione brings to light aspects of alterations in women’s bahaviour patterns and roles. Of rural origin, these families have undergone intense migratory processes, motivated by the search for land and work. Women stood for labour force of communitary organization and played a fundamental role in children raising and family care. It is important to mention that the community in question is located in the metropolitan boundaries of Belo Horizonte, and the families are devoted mainly to farming activities, the non-farming activities performed by them not being the chief ones. Thus, female farm work becomes auxiliary and subordinated to men’s. Besides, women’s participation in the gestion of the community is of secondary importance, occupying positions of smaller political strength. The farming environment in this rural space which lies next to the urban space strongly controls the role played by women. family farming, female labour, rural woman.,...|$|E

5000|$|Whether Lanta {{was ever}} able to {{coordinate}} with Reformed Church members within Toulouse, remains unknown, {{but he did}} begin to levy troops throughout the villages around his country estate (including Blagnac, Colomiers, and Seilh). Lanata's return and his suspicious activities did not go unnoticed by agents of Blaise de Lasseran-Massencôme, seigneur de Montluc the Catholic military lieutenant in Gascony. Montluc forwarded his suspicions to Mansencal, president of the Parlement of Toulouse, saying that he believed Lanta was set to take the city with 1,200 troops on Pentecost (April 18). The Parlement immediately met in emergency session. Thirty-seven [...] signed a document charging over twenty of their colleagues with heresy. Some were viewed as unacceptably moderate (Politiques or Nicodemites), some <b>for</b> <b>being</b> humanists, others on suspicion of Protestant sympathies (not <b>for</b> <b>being</b> Protestants <b>themselves</b> but <b>for</b> allowing their wives or family members to attend Protestant services), still others were viewed as convinced Calvinists. Fully purged, the Parlement issued decrees to counter the planned insurrection by requesting additional military assistance from Anne de Joyeuse to garrison strategic locations in the city including fortifying the Hôtel de Ville. They also discussed how to ban Reformed Church services {{within the walls of}} Toulouse.|$|R
40|$|After innumerable {{scientific}} studies have documented {{the link between}} children’s violence victimization (CVV) and {{a wide range of}} medical, emotional, psychological and behavior disorders, we need to develop and implement effective interventions to treat but also to prevent the negative outcomes of victimization. With regard to prevention, there is growing evidence that CVV is linked to intimate partner violence between parents (IPV) as well as to couple conflict and separation/divorce in general. Children, growing up in high conflict families, are at a heightened risk for child mental health problems over time. Moreover, witnessing IPV increases the children’s risk <b>for</b> <b>being</b> maltreated <b>themselves.</b> Therefore it seems promising to focus on couple functioning when thinking about how to prevent CVV. Fortunately, there are efficacious prevention programs for relationship distress. The following review provides an overview of the definition and prevalence of CVV {{and its impact on the}} individual as well as on society. After synthesizing the most important research findings on the link between CVV, IPV, and couple conflict, evidence-based prevention programs for couples are introduced.
