40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{innovation and}} entrepreneurial opportunities of Internet ventures. In {{the last decade}} the Internet has become an important communication tool {{as well as a}} platform for new business enterprises. Internet businesses are global, easy to set up with little or no capital requirements and innovative. These businesses range from intermediary services such as financial service providers supporting online payments and e-markets facilitating buying and selling in horizontal and vertical markets, to new enterprises selling unique products. However, the Internet age has seen a rise in startup <b>dot.</b> <b>coms,</b> a failure of <b>dot.</b> <b>coms</b> and an increasing trend in consolidation of the digital economy. Entrepreneurial opportunities on the Internet are highlighted in this paper with a review of literature on entrepreneurship opportunities, characteristics and and challenges. It includes case studies demonstrating the opportunities and challenges of Internet innovations and discusses characteristics of cyber entrepreneurs identified from the case studies. The relevance of technical knowledge such as computing and programming skills, perseverance and the ability to set up business with little or no capital are important traits of cyber entrepreneurs discussed in this paper. The other issues apparent from the case studies are an opportunistic and innovative mindset, and an ability to create value where there was none before. This paper highlights that Internet ventures are a type of e-business that are easy to implement, have no barriers to entry and for which technical knowledge is an asset. <br /...|$|R

Using this model, provider organizations can systematically deconstruct healthcare delivery {{in the real world}} and reconstruct appropriate pieces in the virtual world. Observed barriers to virtual healthcare delivery are: resistance to telecommunication integrated delivery networks and outsourcing; confusion over virtual infrastructure requirements for telemedicine and full-service web portals, and the impact of integrated delivery networks and outsourcing on extant cultural norms and revenue generating practices.

The popularity of electronic commerce among the masses {{is still not}} what it was expected and the fall of <b>DOT.</b> <b>COMs</b> has made it even worst. Whereas business-to-business electronic commerce has found the Internet as a new medium to deploy age old EDI based trading mechanism and thus getting a new boost, while business-to-consumer electronic commerce is finding it hard to gather the customer's confidence in trading over the Internet. Many people are reluctant to adopt the new {{way of doing business}} mostly because of distrust on the products and services advertised by many vendors and as a whole on the Internet itself. While the distrust on the Internet is abating thanks to improved cryptographic techniques, the former reason of distrust is still there. In this paper we present a framework to improve customer's trust on the products and services provided over the Internet. Our solution also takes into consideration smaller merchants who want to enter the huge Internet marketplace by providing them a venue for competing with the bigger organizations something that they cannot do in the traditional markets...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The {{business}} {{community in the}} past decade has been characterised by debate over the value or effectiveness of e-Commerce and how this type of technology needs to be implemented. During this period the business world has witnessed many examples of failures of Internet based business. There is little doubt that the high failure rate in <b>Dot.</b> <b>Coms</b> {{had much to do with}} misconceptions regarding the ease with which e-Commerce could be implemented. Unrealistic expectations caused tried and tested business rules to be abandoned as hyperbole over took sound business sense. Although it is clear today that the Internet and the Web can facilitate business processes to add value to organisations, this technology has to be managed with considerable care. This paper reports on a case study conducted in kalahari. net, a well known South African e-Tailing business. This case study highlights several valuable lessons to do with the evaluation of an e-Commerce investment and how to ensure its success. Specifically the case study closely examines aspects of kalahari. net’s IS management policy, and identifies a set of preliminary e-Commerce success dimensions.

40|$|Empirical {{analysis}} from several recent studies has shown mixed {{results on the}} “frictionless market ” hypothesis, claimed by many, about Internet retailing compared to conventional channels. This study takes {{a different approach to}} deal with this paradox of online retailing. Focusing on a homogenous product (videotapes), we use the data set collected between July 12 and August 16, 2000 with a total of 4800 price observations to compare the pricing behavior of six major online branches of traditional retailers with six top specialized Internet retailers. We find that posted prices by the pure Internet players are significantly lower than posted prices by the hybrids online, 6. 42 % on average. However, it is only 3 % lower on average in the full price sense (including shipping costs) and such differences do not seem statistically significant. Further, price changes by both types are few but adjustment magnitudes are large, indicating that menu cost is not as negligible as many claim for the online markets. Price dispersion seems rather large by both types, around 30 %, and statistic evidence shows that it is significantly lower among the <b>dot</b> <b>coms</b> than among the hybrids online in the sense of posted prices, but the contrary in the sense of full prices.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} the emerging {{application service provider}} (ASP) industry which represents the third wave in global IT outsourcing (Currie 2000 a). This is fundamentally different from first wave, traditional service bureau outsourcing, and second wave, enterprise system outsourcing. ASPs offer a new business model {{in the form of}} application outsourcing (AO), enabling large and midsize customers to rent business critical software applications which run over the Internet or a local area network. The utility model offered by ASPs is an attractive value proposition for companies since it may lower their total cost of ownership (TCO) of IT and enable them to scale their business according to their own timescales. The market for branded application outsourcing services is expected to grow to $ 21 billion by 2001. This paper draws from the findings of a large-scale empirical study on the ASP industry in the US and Europe. It develops an analytical framework {{in the form of a}} taxonomy of ASPs, and evaluates their strategies for deploying, hosting, managing and pricing applications on behalf of their customers. Using case study research into pure play, enabler, enterprise, vertical, and horizontal ASPs, the paper seeks to evaluate the opportunities and pitfalls of the ASP business model. It argues that simple choices concerning outsourcing or insourcing are irrelevant in the ASP model, since many SMEs, <b>dot.</b> <b>coms</b> and start-up firms, alike, all of which are seeking hyper-growth, are precluded from sourcing IT capabilities and skills in short time scales- unless they outsource...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to {{critically}} {{examine the impact of}} Internet on business with a particular emphasis on the New Zealand business situation. The focus is on the human elements rather than the technical aspects affecting organisations. The literature review establishes the context for the study with an overview of the development and progress of the Internet as a key component of the business environment. The information gathered from early stages of the research provided a cross-sectional analysis of Internet use in New Zealand industry sectors. Information gained served as a basis for selecting businesses for a more in-depth analysis for face-to-face interviews. A range of interviews were held with participants from organisations that were in the high, moderate and low Internet adoption sectors as identified by the questionnaire responses. Questionnaires were sent to businesses representing the full range of industry sectors via traditional paper channels. An industry- wide, New Zealand- wide sample was sought to give baseline data on New Zealand organisations to gain an understanding of current and future uses. To assess the issues involved in the future application of modern computer communications, issues such as cost-benefit analysis, privacy, security, access to information services and databases, competitive advantage, information management, public relations, marketing and electronic commerce will be explored. A range of issues identified from both the online and offline literature that seemed indicative of emerging and future trends formed the basis of the questions. Once the paper questionnaires had been returned, a comparable sample of respondents was sought, again indicative of all seventeen industry sectors. All respondents in this sample were from organisations that at least had email, even if they did not yet have a presence on the Internet. These customers of Internet Service Providers were sent a largely identical questionnaire by email. The aim was to gather data about organisations already online to identify any early-adopter characteristics and to gather more specific detailed information applicable to this group as existing Internet users. The final research phase was a longitudinal study using a case study methodology. Selected organisations were followed through a three-part process of planning for technology, acquisition and implementation of technology and the final stage of evaluation and audit. Trends from the literature and the questionnaires were examined in the context of New Zealand organisations. Structured interviews were conducted with these organisations. The results of the investigation form the success factors with discussion on the necessary planning, implementation and evaluation for businesses wishing to embrace the medium. As 94 % of New Zealand business are small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs), the majority of findings are relevant to that context in particular although a number can be extrapolated to Internet-connected organisations in general. Three objectives run through the various research phases. The research objectives are: - to identify {{the nature and extent of}} Internet based business activities by organisations in New Zealand - to examine the motives and impacts of these initiatives - to determine factors that contribute to the success of these endeavours The first research phase focusses on the planning issues including perceived and actual information needs of organisations using the Internet. The process of selecting appropriate technology and Internet providers is considered and study made of the competitive advantage offered by the Internet. Implications for organisations such as knowledge gaps, changing power structures with new technology and issues of privacy and controls are also considered. Implications for individuals including workload, communication patterns, training, reskilling and deskilling are pursued. The second research phase focusses on the acquisition and implementation of the Internet by organisations. Comparisons are made between organisations and their strategies for getting online and managing the process of changeover and transition to an Internet-based business environment. The third research phase compares expected and actual outcomes from Internet implementation in organisations. A review is carried out with participating organisations by examining the role of the Internet on business effectiveness. The area of Internet use in organisations needs investigation as the majority are faced with devising an Internet strategy, yet most companies have barely considered the online world till relatively recently. This research considers the implications of this for successful Internet use and presents success factors for organisations. The recent downturn in <b>dot.</b> <b>coms</b> has increased interest in the factors determining success although the cases included in this thesis are not <b>dot.</b> <b>coms</b> as such but ordinary businesses that want to use the Internet...|$|R

For example, the recalled {{position of a}} memorised item is biased toward the average location of all items in a memory array. A recent suggestion is that averaging reflects an attempt to optimise single-item recall by exploiting ensemble statistics. This proposal predicts that the average location is memorised independently from that of individual items. We compared normal subjectsâ�� perceptual estimates of the centre of mass (<b>COM)</b> of three-stimulus <b>dot</b> arrays, <b>COM</b> from recall and single items from recall. Perceptual estimates of COM showed a systematic bias toward the arrayâ��s incenter, COM recall did not show this bias. The precision of COM recall was lower than COM perceptual estimates and higher than single item recall. In a right hemisphere patient with left hemianopia and neglect, COM perceptual estimates were systematically biased contralesionally, while COM recalls were biased ipsilesionally, confirming the dissociation between perception and recall. These findings suggest that COM is recalled by averaging the memorised itemsâ�� positions rather than by retrieving its memorised perceptual estimate. Averaging in spatial recall may arise instead from a reference frame transformation, ensuring that the relative position of the item in the sample array is recalled...|$|R
