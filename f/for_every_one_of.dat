Some losses were to death or desertion, but many Brunswickers became {{familiar}} with America during their time with the Convention Army, and when the war ended, they were granted permission to stay by both Congress and their officers. Many had taken the opportunity to desert as the Convention Army was twice marched through Pennsylvania German settlements in eastern Pennsylvania. As the Duke of Brunswick received compensation from the British <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> his soldiers killed in America, it was in his best interest to report the deserters as dead, whenever possible. The Duke even offered six months' pay to soldiers who remained or returned to America.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{approach}} suggested by , Thomas Hales, {{then at the}} University of Michigan, determined that the maximum density of all arrangements could be found by minimizing a function with 150 variables. In 1992, assisted by his graduate student Samuel Ferguson, he embarked on a research program to systematically apply linear programming methods to find a lower bound {{on the value of}} this function for each one of a set of over 5,000 different configurations of spheres. If a lower bound (for the function value) could be found <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> these configurations that was greater than the value of the function for the cubic close packing arrangement, then the Kepler conjecture would be proved. To find lower bounds for all cases involved solving about 100,000 linear programming problems.|$|E

In October 1879 Newport RFC played Cardiff RFC in a floodlit game at Rodney Parade; the first ground to have floodlights installed in Wales. Newport rugby club enjoyed six highly successful seasons, having been unbeaten for six consecutive seasons. Newport sustained their first defeat in the 1870s, they were again unbeaten in seasons 1891-2 and 1922-3. Monmouthshire County Cricket Club played at Rodney Parade from 1901 to 1934. Newport RFC provided internationals <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the four home countries at Rodney Parade, as well as South Africa. Newport were once scheduled for a regular fixture, against Bristol - a team drawn from Welsh, English, Irish and Scottish internationals.

25|$|Bermudians {{turned from}} their failed {{agricultural}} economy {{to the sea}} after the 1684 dissolution of the Somers Isles Company. With a total landmass of , and lacking any natural resources, other than the Bermuda cedar, the colonists applied themselves fully to the maritime trades, developing the speedy Bermuda sloop, which was well suited both to commerce and to commerce raiding. Bermudian merchant vessels turned to privateering at every opportunity, during the 18th century, preying on the shipping of Spain, France and other nations during a series of wars. They typically left Bermuda with very large crews. This advantage in manpower was vital in seizing larger vessels, which themselves often lacked enough crewmembers {{to put up a}} strong defence. The extra crew men were also useful as prize crews for returning captured vessels. Despite close links to the American colonies (and the material aid provided the continental rebels {{in the form of a}} hundred barrels of stolen gunpowder), Bermudian privateers turned as aggressively on American shipping during the American War of Independence. An American naval captain, ordered to take his ship out of Boston Harbour to eliminate a pair of Bermudian privateering vessels, which had been picking off vessels missed by the Royal Navy, returned frustrated, saying the Bermudians sailed their ships two feet <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> ours. The only attack on Bermuda during the war was carried out by two sloops captained by a pair of Bermudian-born brothers (they damaged a fort and spiked its guns before retreating). It greatly surprised the Americans to discover that the crews of Bermudian privateers included Black slaves, as, with limited manpower, Bermuda had legislated that a part of all Bermudian crews must be made up of Blacks. In fact, when the Bermudian privateer Regulator was captured, virtually all of her crew were found to be Black slaves. Authorities in Boston offered these men their freedom, but all 70 elected to be treated as Prisoners of War. Sent to New York on the sloop Duxbury, they seized the vessel and sailed it back to Bermuda. The American War of 1812 was to be the encore of Bermudian privateering, which had died out after the 1790s, due partly to the buildup of the naval base in Bermuda, which reduced the Admiralty's reliance on privateers in the western Atlantic, and partly to successful American legal suits, and claims for damages pressed against British privateers, a large portion of which were aimed squarely at the Bermudians. During the course of the American War of 1812, Bermudian privateers were to capture 298 ships (the total captures by all British naval and privateering vessels between the Great Lakes and the West Indies was 1,593 vessels).|$|E

By early January, the defenders could count on fire support from 46 artillery pieces of various calibers, five tanks armed with 90mm guns, and 92 single or Ontos-mounted 106mm recoilless rifles. The base could also depend on fire support from US Army 175mm guns located at Camp Carroll, east of Khe Sanh. Throughout the battle, Marine artillerymen fired 158,891 mixed rounds. In addition, over 100,000 tons of bombs were dropped until mid-April by aircraft of the Air Force, US Navy and Marines onto the area surrounding Khe Sanh. This equates to roughly 1,300 tons of bombs dropped daily—five tons <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the 20,000 NVA soldiers initially estimated to have been committed to the fighting at Khe Sanh.

500|$|Another myth {{concerns}} Saul Bass, {{the graphic}} designer who created {{many of the}} title sequences of Hitchcock's films and storyboarded some of Psychos scenes, claiming he had directed the shower scene.

I was in that shower for seven days, and, believe me, Alfred Hitchcock was right next to his camera <b>for</b> <b>every</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those seventy-odd shots." [...] Hilton A.

500|$|Although {{the cathedral}} is modest in size, {{it is very}} richly ornamented. As was his usual practice, {{from his office in}} Buckingham Street {{and in the course of}} many site visits, Burges oversaw all aspects of the design, {{including}} the statuary, the stained glass and the furniture, charging 10% rather than his usual 5%, owing to the high level of his personal involvement.

Lawrence and Wilson consider the result [...] "undoubtedly [...] greatest work in ecclesiastical architecture" [...] with an interior that is [...] "overwhelming and intoxicating." [...] Through his ability, by the careful leadership of his team, by total artistic control, and by vastly exceeding the intended budget of £15,000, Burges produced a building that in size is little more than a large parish church but in impression is described in Lawrence and Wilson's study as [...] "a cathedral becoming such a city and one which posterity may regard as a monument to the Almighty's praise." ...|$|E
