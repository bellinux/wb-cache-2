25|$|Ramsey's theorem is a {{foundational}} {{result in}} combinatorics. The {{first version of}} this result was proved by F. P. Ramsey. This initiated the combinatorial theory now called Ramsey theory, that seeks regularity amid disorder: general conditions {{for the existence of}} substructures with regular properties.

The question now to be answered is whether the legislative act here assailed is subject to the same condemnation. Certainly, it is not so on its face, for, although the mode of death described is conceded to be unusual, there is no common knowledge or consent that it is cruel; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of fact whether an electric current of sufficient intensity and skillfully applied will produce death without unnecessary suffering.|$|E

25|$|Most labyrinthodonts {{had special}} sense organs in the skin, forming a lateral line organ for {{perception}} of water flow and pressure, like {{those found in}} fish {{and a number of}} modern amphibians.

Early labyrinthodont groups had massive stapes, likely primarily anchoring the brain case to the skull roof. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of some doubt whether early terrestrial labyrinthodonts had the stapes connected to a tympanum covering their otic notch, and if they had an aerial sense of hearing at all.

500|$|After the British 5th Infantry Division had {{achieved}} its objectives, the 5th New Zealand Infantry Brigade attacked at 04:00 on 24 December. Despite intensive artillery support (272 guns on a [...] front), the tired and understrength New Zealand battalions {{struggled to make}} progress. By the afternoon, it had become clear to the New Zealand commander—Bernard Freyberg—that the stubborn defences of the 26th Panzer Division would not be broached. He {{is reported to have}} remarked, [...] "It {{is not a question of}} further advance, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of holding on to what we have got".

500|$|In 1948, Henery Wise {{who visited}} Lahaina Fort, where the then {{governor}} was residing, noted: “ a large square enclosure constructed of red coral rocks, banked up fifteen feet with earth , and mounting an oddly resorted battery of some thirty pieces of artillery, {{of all sorts}} of cartridges , and claibre long, short, and medium; they commanded the usual anchorage and no doubt very well to prevent any acts of violence from merchant ships; but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> if, at the second discharging of shot, they do not tremble to pieces.

[...] The writer Sigurd Hoel asked: [...] "When did it become a reason for deportation that one looked in a microscope when one was not a trained biologist?" [...] Reich received support from overseas, first from the anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, who in March wrote to the press in Norway that Reich's sociological works were [...] "a distinct and valuable contribution toward science," [...] and from A.S.

500|$|As the whaling {{industry}} declined and the California Gold Rush gained {{prominence in}} the late 1840s, Hawaii's population dropped, and infectious disease epidemics contributed {{to the loss of}} local populations. The fort was restored in 1847 but was now used more as a prison than for defending the Kingdom. The cannons were rusting and the fort was mostly empty of personnel except for a few soldiers and the Governor of Maui who lived there. When Henry Augustus Wise visited in 1848, he met James Young (1797–1851), then Governor of Maui, who was living in the fort. [...] Wise wrote that it was: an oddly assorted battery of some thirty pieces of artillery, of all sorts of carriages and calibre—long, short, and mediums; they command the usual anchorage, and no doubt do very well to prevent any acts of violence from merchant ships; but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question,</b> if, at the second discharge of shot, they do not tumble to pieces.|$|E

The Ohio Works club gained steam, however, and began to win games. On May 11, 1905, the Youngstown team garnered controversy when The Akron Times-Democrat reported that the Ohio Works' sponsors provided player salaries that nearly doubled those offered by other clubs in the Ohio–Pennsylvania League. In {{a report on the}} outcry in Akron, The Youngstown Daily Vindicator warned that, [...] "if the Youngstown backers keep adding and force the other clubs to add to the salaries, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of only a short time until independent baseball will be an impossibility".

500|$|Edward Teller {{was opposed}} to the hearing, feeling it was {{improper}} to subject Oppenheimer to a security trial, but was torn by longstanding grievances against him. He was called by Robb to testify against Oppenheimer, and shortly before he appeared Robb showed Teller a dossier of items unfavorable to Oppenheimer. Teller testified that he considered Oppenheimer loyal, but that [...] "in {{a great number of}} cases, I have seen Dr. Oppenheimer act – I understand that Dr. Oppenheimer acted – in a way which for me was exceedingly hard to understand. I thoroughly disagreed with him in numerous issues and his actions frankly appeared to me confused and complicated. To this extent I feel that I {{would like to see the}} vital interests of this country in hands which I understand better, and therefore trust more." [...] Asked whether Oppenheimer should be granted a security clearance, Teller said that [...] "if <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of wisdom or judgement, as demonstrated by actions since 1945, then I would say one would be wiser not to grant clearance." [...] This led to outrage by many in the scientific community and Teller's ostracism and virtual expulsion from academic science.|$|E

500|$|On 18 June {{the judge}} began his summing-up. He drew the jury's {{attention}} to the previous good character of the defendants, whom he characterised as [...] "men of hitherto unblemished reputation." [...] Cantley described Thorpe as [...] "a national figure with a very distinguished public record". The judge was scathing about the principal witnesses: Bessell was a [...] "humbug" [...] whose contract with The Sunday Telegraph was [...] "deplorable"; Scott was a fraud, a sponger, a whiner, a parasite—"but of course he could still be telling the truth. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>question</b> of belief." [...] Newton was characterised as a perjurer and a chump, [...] "determined to milk the case {{as hard as he}} can." [...] The mystery surrounding the £20,000 that Thorpe had obtained from Hayward was dismissed as an irrelevance: [...] "The fact that a man obtains money by deceit does not [...] that the man {{was a member of a}} conspiracy." [...] Waugh felt that the judge's lack of even-handedness could well provoke a counteraction against the accused from the jury. The summing-up became the subject of a scathing parody by the satirist Peter Cook, written and delivered shortly after the trial at The Secret Policeman's Ball in aid of Amnesty International. Cook's version, according to Freeman and Penrose, was [...] "actually not that different from the original." ...|$|E
