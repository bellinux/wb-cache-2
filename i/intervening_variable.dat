40|$|The {{on going}} {{quest for a}} better {{understanding}} and prediction of adoption behaviour through the identification {{and analysis of the}} most influential behaviour determinants gave rise to this study. It was especially designed with the main objective of determining the comparative role of independent and <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> on the adoption of seed spacing among maize growers in the Njombe district of Tanzania. A pre-tested structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 113 farmers randomly selected to represent 5 percent samples of four villages selected to represent the biggest variation in terms of the climatic conditions in the district. The outstanding finding of this research is the much stronger and more consistent relationship that <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> have compared to the independent variables, which is in support of the research hypothesis. The total contribution of <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> to the variation of adoption behaviour is as much as 93 percent, which far exceeds that of the independent variables contributing only 6 percent. This supports the assumption that the <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> are the direct precursors of adoption behaviour and that the influence of independent variable becomes manifested in adoption behaviour via the <b>intervening</b> <b>variables.</b> From this emerge exciting possibilities for behaviour interventions of development programmes, but more research is necessary to verify the findings in different countries and cultures and to refine the selection of the most relevant <b>intervening</b> <b>variables...</b>|$|R

40|$|The ongoing {{quest for}} a better {{understanding}} of adoption behaviour, and more specifically the search for relevant, and meaningful behaviour determinants that can be useful in the understanding, analysis and change of adoption behaviour, has prompted this study. It was specifically focused on the role of <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> and their influence relative to the commonly used independent variables. A pre-tested, structured questionnaire was used to collect data from 113 farmers randomly selected to represent five percent samples of four villages selected to represent the biggest variation in terms of climatic conditions within the Njombe district of Tanzania. Correlations, chi-square, and regressions were used to determine the relationship between the independent and the dependent variables. The results show that most of the farmers’ (97. 3 percent) production efficiency falls well below the optimum maize yield of about 40 bags per acre. Various independent and intervening factors were found to influence adoption. In general, the <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> show, without exception, much stronger influence relationships with adoption behaviour than is the case with independent variables. Also, unlike what is a common phenomenon among independent variables, these relationships show great consistency, which further supports the research hypothesis. The most convincing evidence in support of the critical role of <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> in decision making and adoption behaviour are the regressions, which explain about 73. 2 to 93. 6 percent of the variation in adoption as compared to the mere 6. 0 to 32. 9 percent of the independent variables. The explanation for this highly significant difference is that the <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> are probably the immediate and direct determinants of adoption behaviour and that the influence of <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> only becomes manifested in adoption behaviour via the <b>intervening</b> <b>variables.</b> This explains why the influence of independent variables is much smaller and more inconsistent than that of the <b>intervening</b> <b>variables.</b> The practical implications of these findings are that the emphasis in the analysis and understanding of adoption behaviour should be on the <b>intervening</b> <b>variables.</b> They lend themselves as so-called “forces of change” and thus represent the focus of extension endeavours, but also as criteria for evaluation and monitoring. From the study arise various issues that call for further research like refinement of the measurements. Thesis (PhD(Agrarian Extension)) [...] University of Pretoria, 2008.

40|$|Since {{about the}} mid- 19602 ̆ 7 s {{there has been}} {{increasing}} interest in diffusion research among consumer researchers, especially that focused on innovations. Most consumer researchers have considered time of adoption as directly related to innovativeness as a personality trait. However, Midgley and Dowling (1978) suggested communication and complex situational effects intervene in the individual 2 ̆ 7 s innovativeness, and concluded that it was meaningless to ascribe any meaning to empirical correlations without {{a model of the}} processes intervening between trait innovativeness and innovative behavior. ^ The {{purpose of the study was}} to construct an operational model of innovativeness and compare it to the Midgley and Dowling (1978) hypothetical model. Four hypotheses were formulated for the present study. ^ One hundred and sixty nine Lafayette area residents contacted by means of a mailed survey served as subjects for the study. ^ LISREL analysis was used to test the hypotheses of the study. The results suggested that: (1) there was no significant direct relationship between trait innovativeness and innovative behavior as predicted; (2) there was a significant indirect relationship between trait innovativeness and innovative behavior; (3) the significant <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> between trait innovativeness and innovative behavior were interest in product category, media exposure, and word of mouth; and (4) the sequence of <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> was interest in product category, media exposure, and word of mouth. ^ The present investigation supports the theory which implies that innovative behavior as evidenced by the adoption of new products by an individual is exhibited through a process rather than as a direct effect of trait innovativeness. A model which includes <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> might help to provide a better means of prediction of innovative behavior. Therefore, it might be more desirable to consider <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> as a part of a multi-stage process in innovativeness research. Even though <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> were important for the process of innovativeness, most of the variables, except interest in product category, did not show significant effects on innovative behavior at the. 05 probability level. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to {{identify}} the main factors influencing the small-scale production of sugar cane in Nkomazi, Mupumalanga province. The study assesses the influence of some selected personal and environmental, and intervening factors on the adoption of recommended agricultural practices and farming success or production efficiency of small-scale sugar cane growers. A total of 139 farmers were randomly drawn from two distinct districts of Komatipoort and Malelane in Nkomazi, which represented a ` 10 % stratified sample. In the analysis of data, correlation, chi-square analysis, as well as multiple regressions analysis were used in order to identify the most important determinants associated with behavioural change and to calculate their contribution to the variance of farming success. The results indicate that, the <b>intervening</b> <b>variables</b> tended to have the highest prediction value. They were found to explain 87, 13 % of the variance of behaviour associated with the production efficiency, while the independent variables had R 2 of 0. 50 thus contributing significantly less to the variance of farming success. Amongst the <b>intervening</b> <b>variables,</b> needs and knowledge were found to have the greatest effect on the farming success or dependent variables (P< 0, 0001).

50|$|Racism {{consists}} of both prejudice and discrimination based in social perceptions of observable biological differences between peoples. It often {{takes the form}} of social actions, practices or beliefs, or political systems in which different races are perceived to be ranked as inherently superior or inferior to each other, based on presumed shared inheritable traits, abilities, or qualities. In a given society, those who share racial characteristics socially perceived as undesirable are typically under-represented in positions of social power, i.e., they become a minority category in that society. Minority members in such a society are often subjected to discriminatory actions resulting from majority policies, including assimilation, exclusion, oppression, expulsion, and extermination. Overt racism usually feeds directly into a stratification system through its effect on social status. For example, members associated with a particular race may be assigned a slave status, a form of oppression in which the majority refuses to grant basic rights to a minority that are granted to other members of the society. More covert racism, such as that which many scholars posit is practiced in more contemporary societies, is socially hidden and less easily detectable. Covert racism often feeds into stratification systems as an <b>intervening</b> <b>variable</b> affecting income, educational opportunities, and housing. Both overt and covert racism can take the form of structural inequality in a society in which racism has become institutionalized.|$|E
50|$|Ethnic {{prejudice}} and discrimination operate {{much the same}} as do racial {{prejudice and}} discrimination in society. In fact, only recently have scholars begun to differentiate race and ethnicity; historically, the two were considered to be identical or closely related. With the scientific development of genetics and the human genome as fields of study, most scholars now recognize that race is socially defined on the basis of biologically determined characteristics that can be observed within a society while ethnicity is defined on the basis of culturally learned behavior. Ethnic identification can include shared cultural heritage such as language and dialect, symbolic systems, religion, mythology and cuisine. As with race, ethnic categories of persons may be socially defined as minority categories whose members are under-represented in positions of social power. As such, ethnic categories of persons can be subject to the same types of majority policies. For example, the Bosnian war {{that took place in the}} 1990s was accompanied by a threat of extermination called ethnic cleansing of the Muslim Bosniak and Croat population, especially in eastern Bosnia and throughout the Republika Srpska. Whether ethnicity feeds into a stratification system as a direct, causal factor or as an <b>intervening</b> <b>variable</b> may depend on the level of ethnocentrism within each of the various ethnic populations in a society, the amount of conflict over scarce resources, and the relative social power held within each ethnic category.|$|E

In addition, in a dual setting, the resulting subproblems yield simple analytical relationships between the primal and dual variables, which is often not the case with the original nonlinear approximations.
