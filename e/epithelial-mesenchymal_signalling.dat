40|$|Summary Salivary glands {{provide an}} {{excellent}} {{model for the}} study of epithelial–mesenchymal interactions. We have looked at the interactions involved in the early initiation and development of murine salivary glands using classic recombination experiments and knockout mice. We show that salivary gland epithelium, at thickening and initial bud stages, is able to direct salivary gland development in non-gland pharyngeal arch mesenchyme at early stages. The early salivary gland epithelium is therefore able to induce gland development in non-gland tissue. This ability later shifts to the mesenchyme, with non-gland epithelium, such as from the limb bud, able to form a branching gland when combined with pseudoglandular stage gland mesenchyme. This shift appears to involve Fgf signalling, with signals from the epithelium inducing Fgf 10 in the mesenchyme. Fgf 10 then signals back to the epithelium to direct gland down-growth and bud development. These experiments highlight the importance of <b>epithelial–mesenchymal</b> <b>signalling</b> in gland initiation, controlling where, when and how many salivary glands form...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{development}} of feather buds {{is a highly}} ordered process involving <b>epithelial–mesenchymal</b> <b>signalling.</b> Cellular morphology {{is determined by the}} actin cytoskeleton, which is controlled by networks of regulators such as the GTPases. EphA 4 belongs to a receptor tyrosine kinase family that has been consistently shown to regulate the cytoskeleton via Rho family GTPases in neural development and is expressed in early stages of feather bud development though its role has not been defined. We therefore used an in vitro skin culture system to interfere with EphA 4 levels in feather buds using anti-sense oligonucleotides, demonstrating a severe effect on both their number and morphological form. Analysis of the Rho family of GTPases revealed that this effect was mediated by the GTPase RhoB, the expression of which was altered in response to altered levels of EphA 4. In addition, the inhibition of RhoB mimicked the effects of reduced EphA 4 levels on feather development. Significantly, manipulation of cytoskeletal dynamics revealed that those cells undergoing morphogenetic change regulate the patterning signals responsible for initiating feather development. We propose that this molecular maintenance mechanism between EphA 4 –RhoB and the actin cytoskeleton converges or coordinates with other morphogenic signalling systems to control feather bud development...|$|E
40|$|The role of {{epidermal}} keratinocytes in {{the early}} phase of normal unimpaired wound healing has been extensively studied. However, little is known of the cell biological process in the epidermis {{and the role of}} keratinocytes in hypertrophic scar formation. This study investigated the possible role of p 63 {{in the early}} phase of hypertrophic scarring pathogenesis. Nine skin samples were taken from nine patients during plastic surgery operations, as follows: 1. six samples from patients who on account of thyroid disease or other reasons presented risk factors (RFs) for hypertrophic scarring; 2. one sample from a healthy young person (as control); and 3. one sample from the upper eyelid during blepharoplasty and one sample from an elderly patient during breast reduction. All the patients were women, and were followed up clinically for 12 months. Skin specimens were cultured and sectioned, and analysed by histology and immunohistochemistry. In normal skin, nuclear p 63 was abundantly expressed by the basal cells, but expressed by very low levels of transient amplifying (TA) keratinocytes covering the surface. TA keratinocytes, immediately after their withdrawal from the stem cell compartment, reduced p 63, even though they possessed a proliferative capacity. In some skin, samples with RFs possessed a high level of p 63 expression - not only basal stem cells but also four to five rows of parabasal cells. Four of the six skin samples with RFs showed significant epidermal abnormalities through the expression of both p 63 and ki- 67. Staining for ki- 67, a marker for cell proliferation, revealed more increase in the suprabasal than in the basal keratinocyte proliferation rate. These results suggest that the epidermal keratinocytes may have an important role in hypertrophic scarring pathogenesis, using paracrine or <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signalling.</b> At 3, 6, and 12 months post-operation this finding clinically appeared in four patients with RFs...|$|E
40|$|<b>Epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> {{interactions}} are critical events that regulate organogenesis. The research {{presented in this}} thesis establishes that the extra-cellular BMP antagonist Gremlin is essential to initiate, maintain and propagate such <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> feedback <b>signaling</b> during limb and metanephric kidney organogenesis. Furthermore, modulating BMP activity by Gremlin-mediated antagonism appears to be critical to epithelial morphogenesis. In particular, Gremlin-mediated BMP antagonism is essential for proper differentiation of AER epithelial cells, a key event in initiation of distal limb bud outgrowth. Moreover, Gremlin is also involved in the differentiation of lung epithelial cells that {{play a major role}} in supporting gas exchange. Finally, genetic studies establish that the Gremlin loss-of-function allele generated by gene targeting is allelic to the mouse limb deformity (ld) mutation. These studies show that Gremlin, not Formin, is the gene whose disruption causes the ld limb phenotype. The ld limb phenotype is caused either by disruption of the Gremlin transcription unit or by disruption of distant cis-regulatory elements with features of a global control region (GCR) that regulates activation of both Gremlin and Formin expression in the posterior limb bud mesenchyme...|$|R

The testicular defects seen in PDGF-A 2 / 2 mice, combined with the normal developmental expression of PDGF-A and PDGF-R a, indicate that through an <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling,</b> the PDGF-A gene {{is essential for the}} development of the Leydig cell lineage. These findings suggest that PDGF-A may play a role in the cascade of genes involved in male gonad differentiation.

50|$|The protein encoded by {{this gene}} {{is a member}} of the {{fibroblast}} growth factor (FGF) family. FGF family members possess broad mitogenic and cell survival activities, and are involved in a variety of biological processes, including embryonic development, cell growth, morphogenesis, tissue repair, tumor growth and invasion. Fibroblast growth factor 10 is a paracrine signaling molecule seen first in the limb bud and organogenesis development. FGF10 starts the developing of limbs and its involved in the branching of morphogenesis in multiple organs such as the lungs, skin, ear and salivary glands. During the limb development Tbx4/Tbx5 stimulate the production of FGF10 in the lateral plate mesoderm where it will create an <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> FGF <b>signal</b> with FGF8. This positive feedback loop will increase the amount of mesenchyme resulting in a bulge. Afterwards, FGF10 will induce the formation of apical ectodermal ridge (AER) where the foot and hands will be formed. Lung development uses the same <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> from FGF10 in the foregut mesenchyme with FGFR2 in the foregut epithelium. FGF10 signaling is required for epithelial branching. Therefore, all branching morphogen organs such as the lungs, skin, ear and salivary glands required the constant expression of FGF10. This protein exhibits mitogenic activity for keratinizing epidermal cells, but essentially no activity for fibroblasts, which is similar to the biological activity of FGF7.|$|R
40|$|Cell-cell communication, and {{specifically}} <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signalling,</b> {{is a key}} factor determining normal tissue development and organisation in hollow organs such as gastrointestinal tract. Mechanisms governing normal epithelial-mesenchymal communication have been studied for many years, but the changes occurring during tissue damage, infection and inflammation, and in cancer, remain unclear. Myofibroblasts are recognised as key mesenchymal cells involved in this communication in health and in disease. Myofibroblasts produce and secrete many proteins responsible for the assembly of extracellular matrix (ECM), tissue organisation and morphogenesis. Initial studies from this laboratory suggested that myofibroblasts might exhibit regulated secretion. The aim of this project {{was to determine the}} secretory mechanisms of myofibroblasts from the upper gut of normal and cancer tissues, and to address their significance in cancer. Gastric myofibroblasts were shown to exhibit calcium-dependent secretion of the small ECM protein, Transforming growth factor-β inducible protein or TGFβig-h 3, in response to acute stimulation (30 min) with insulin-like growth factor (IGF) s. Inhibitors of protein synthesis (actinomycin D and cycloheximide) and of protein transport from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to Golgi (brefeldin A) inhibited basal, but not IGF-stimulated secretion, as seen from Western blot analyses of media. These observations support the idea that evoked secretion occurs from a pre-formed pool of vesicles. Myofibroblasts from the upper gut showed differences in their secretory phenotype; specifically normal myofibroblasts from stomach exhibited regulated secretion, but their counterparts from oesophagus did not. Moreover, gastric cancer-associated myofibroblasts (CAMs) from patients with poor survival tend not to exhibit regulated secretion. These findings suggest a role for the tissue microenvironment in determining the secretory phenotype of myofibroblasts. Secretome-wide analysis of myofibroblasts media collected after IGF stimulation revealed that about 85 % of the secretome exhibits evoked release. The relevant proteins belonged to different classes including ECM proteins, ligands, binding proteins, carbohydrate-binding proteins, proteases and protease inhibitors. These data indicate that myofibroblasts may contribute to tissue organisation by rapid release of substances involved in re-modelling the tissue microenvironment. The regulated secretory phenotype of myofibroblasts was associated with the expression of the chromogranin-like protein, secretogranin II. Knock-down of secretogranin II inhibited regulated secretion, whereas over-expression in myofibroblasts that lacked regulated released - induced it. Expression of secretogranin II by myofibroblasts coincided with the expression of dense core secretory vesicles that were similar to those found in neuroendocrine cells. This work indicates that there is a neuroendocrine-like secretory phenotype in myofibroblasts, as illustrated by the expression of neuroendocrine cell protein secretogranin II and the presence of regulated secretion. However, not all normal myofibroblasts exhibit the regulated phenotype, and in gastric cancer the phenotype correlates with early stage of disease. These findings may be exploitable both in the development of novel therapies and in understanding cancer progression...|$|E
40|$|In {{common with}} other hollow organs, the gastric mucosa {{consists}} of exocrine and endocrine epithelial cells and sub-epithelial stromal cells, {{all of which}} secrete mediators into the tissue microenvironment that define mucosal architecture and maintain organ function. Gastric myofibroblasts are an important stromal cell population involved in maintaining mucosal integrity, and are implicated in pathophysiological processes including chronic inflammation, fibrosis and cancer. Urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its inhibitor plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI) - 1 are secreted by gastric epithelial and stromal cells and, together with the uPA receptor (uPAR), {{are believed to be}} involved in <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signalling.</b> However, the role of the uPA system in regulating gastric mucosal morphological homeostasis and responses to acute and chronic challenges is not yet fully understood. In this thesis, it was shown that transgenic PAI- 1 -H/Kβ mice, which have increased expression of PAI- 1 in gastric parietal cells, have elevated concentrations of circulating PAI- 1 and develop age-dependent increases in corpus mucosal thickness, independent of changes in parietal cell and myofibroblast abundance. PAI- 1 did not have a direct trophic effect on gastric epithelial cells, indicating that PAI- 1 might act via an indirect mechanism to modulate gastric epithelial cell turnover. In order to determine whether PAI- 1 influences the gastric tissue microenvironment via myofibroblast gene expression, global transcript expression profiles of gastric myofibroblasts from wild-type and PAI- 1 null (PAI- 1 -/-) mice were compared. Whole genome microarrays and subsequent validation by immunofluorescence indicated that mouse antral myofibroblasts are highly heterogeneous, including both desmin positive and desmin negative cells with distinct global transcript expression profiles. Furthermore, there was evidence that antral myofibroblasts displayed phenotypic plasticity in vitro, developing a neuroendocrine-like phenotype marked by expression of secretogranin- 2. Plasticity may be functionally significant in vivo, supporting the role of myofibroblasts in wound healing. The role of PAI- 1 in gastric mucosal responses to chronic Helicobacter infection was investigated using the H. felis model in wild-type, PAI- 1 -/- and PAI- 1 -H/Kβ mice. Both absence of PAI- 1 and increased expression of gastric PAI- 1 were protective against Helicobacter-induced preneoplastic gastric histopathology. Responses to acute gastric mucosal injury were investigated using intragastric indomethacin administration. Gastric PAI- 1 protected against the development of lesions, whilst exogenous PAI- 1 exacerbated the development of indomethacin induced gastric mucosal injury. Gastric uPA expression did not effect the development of lesions, whilst absence of uPAR tended to exacerbate lesion development. Taken together, the data presented in this thesis suggest a broadly protective role of PAI- 1 in the gastric mucosa. A common therapeutic strategy for the prevention of NSAID-induced gastric injury, ulcer complications and progression of Helicobacter-induced gastric preneoplasia might be emerging, aimed at specifically increasing PAI- 1 bioavailability in the gastric mucosa...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{prostate}} gland {{plays an important}} role in male reproduction, and is also an organ prone to diseases such as benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer. The prostate consists of ducts with an inner layer of epithelium surrounded by stroma. Reciprocal signaling between these two cell compartments is instrumental to normal prostatic development, homeostasis, regeneration, as well as tumor formation. Hedgehog (HH) signaling is a master regulator in numerous developmental processes. In many organs, HH plays a key role in <b>epithelial–mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> that regulates organ growth and tissue differentiation, and abnormal HH signaling has been implicated in the progression of various epithelial carcinomas. In this review, we focus on recent studies exploring the multipotency of endogenous postnatal and adult epithelial and stromal stem cells and studies addressing the role of HH in prostate development and cancer. We discuss the implications of the results for a new understanding of prostate development and disease. Insight into the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying epithelial–mesenchymal growth regulation should provide a basis for devising innovative therapies to combat diseases of the prostate...|$|R
40|$|Hair {{follicle}} morphogenesis, {{a complex}} process requiring interaction between epithelia-derived keratinocytes and the underlying mesenchyme, is an attractive model system to study organ development and tissue-specific signaling. Although hair follicle development is genetically tractable, fast and reproducible analysis of factors essential for this process remains a challenge. Here we describe a procedure to generate targeted over expression or shRNA-mediated knockdown of factors using lentivirus in a tissue-specific manner. Using {{a modified version of}} a hair regeneration model 5, 6, 11, we can achieve robust gain-or loss-of-function analysis in primary mouse keratinocytes or dermal cells to facilitate study of <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways that lead to hair follicle morphogenesis. We describe how to isolate fresh primary mouse keratinocytes and dermal cells, which contain dermal papilla cells and their precursors, deliver lentivirus containing either shRNA or cDNA to one of the cell populations, and combine the cells to generate fully formed hair follicles on the backs of nude mice. This approach allows analysis of tissue-specific factors required to generate hair follicles within three weeks and provides a fast and convenient companion to existing genetic models...|$|R
40|$|Neural crest cells (NCCs) are {{a subset}} of multipotent, migratory stem cells that {{populate}} {{a large number of}} tissues during development and are important for craniofacial and cardiac morphogenesis. Although microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of development and disease, little is known about their role in NCC development. Here, we show that loss of miRNA biogenesis by NCC-specific disruption of murine Dicer results in embryos lacking craniofacial cartilaginous structures, cardiac outflow tract septation and thymic and dorsal root ganglia development. Dicer mutant embryos had reduced expression of Dlx 2, a transcriptional regulator of pharyngeal arch development, in the first pharyngeal arch (PA 1). miR- 452 was enriched in NCCs, was sufficient to rescue Dlx 2 expression in Dicer mutant pharyngeal arches, and regulated non-cell-autonomous signaling involving Wnt 5 a, Shh and Fgf 8 that converged on Dlx 2 regulation in PA 1. Correspondingly, knockdown of miR- 452 in vivo decreased Dlx 2 expression in the mandibular component of PA 1, leading to craniofacial defects. These results suggest that post-transcriptional regulation by miRNAs is required for differentiation of NCC-derived tissues and that miR- 452 is involved in <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> in the pharyngeal arch...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Epimorphin is a mesenchymal {{morphogen}} {{that has}} been shown to mediate <b>epithelial–mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> interactions in various organs. We now show that epimorphin functions in hair follicle morphogenesis; using a novel ex vivo organ culture assay, we define a mechanism for epimorphin signaling that may provide insight into general developmental processes. We found that epimorphin was produced by follicular mesenchymal cells and bound selectively to follicular epithelial cells, and that treatment with recombinant epimorphin could stimulate procession of hair follicles from telogen (resting stage) to anagen (growing stage). Based on analyses of epimorphin proteolytic digests that suggested a smaller peptide might be able to substitute for the full-length epimorphin molecule, we determined that pep 7, a 10 -amino acid peptide, was capable of inducing telogen-to-anagen transition both in the culture assay and in the mouse. That pep 7 showed maximal activity only when modified with specific sulfhydryl-reactive reagents suggested that a particular structural conformation of the peptide was essential for activity; molecular dynamics studies were pursued to investigate the active peptide structure. These findings define a previously unknown morphogenic process in the hair follicle that may have applications to many other organs. OTakebe, K., Oka, Y. ...|$|R
40|$|Formation of {{numerous}} internal organs involves reciprocal <b>epithelial–mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> and subsequent patterning {{and growth of}} the organ primordium. Capsulin is a basic helix–loop–helix transcription factor expressed in mesenchymal cells that encapsulate the epithelial primordia of internal organs, including the kidney and lung, {{as well as the}} epicardium, which gives rise to the coronary arteries. Capsulin is also expressed in the mesothelium that gives rise to the spleen. We demonstrate that mice homozygous for a capsulin null mutation fail to form a spleen. The homeobox genes Hox 11 and Bapx 1, shown previously to be essential regulators of spleen organogenesis, and a lacZ reporter introduced into the capsulin locus, were expressed in the early splenic primordium, derived from the splanchnic mesoderm, of homozygous mutant embryos. However, this primordium failed to develop beyond an initial group of precursor cells and underwent rapid apoptosis. The phenotype of capsulin mutant mice demonstrates that capsulin acts within a subpopulation of splanchnic mesodermal cells to control an essential early step in spleen organogenesis that is likely to represent a point of regulatory convergence of the capsulin, Hox 11, and Bapx 1 genes...|$|R

40|$|AbstractEvolution {{of facial}} {{morphology}} arises from {{variation in the}} activity of developmental regulatory networks that guide the formation of specific craniofacial elements. Importantly, the acquisition of novel morphology must be integrated with a phylogenetically inherited developmental program. We have identified a unique region of the secondary palate associated with the periodic formation of rugae during the rostral outgrowth of the face. Rugae function as SHH signaling centers to pattern the elongating palatal shelves. We have found that a network of signaling genes and transcription factors is spatially organized relative to palatal rugae. Additionally, the first formed ruga is strategically positioned at the presumptive junction of the future hard and soft palate that defines anterior–posterior differences in regional growth, mesenchymal gene expression, and cell fate. We propose a molecular circuit integrating FGF and BMP signaling to control proliferation and differentiation during the sequential formation of rugae and inter-rugae domains in the palatal epithelium. The loss of p 63 and Sostdc 1 expression and failed rugae differentiation highlight that coordinated <b>epithelial–mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> is lost in the Fgf 10 mutant palate. Our results establish a genetic program that reiteratively organizes signaling domains to coordinate {{the growth of the}} secondary palate with the elongating midfacial complex...|$|R
40|$|In the {{indirect}} developing sea urchin embryo, the primary mesenchyme cells (PMCs) acquire {{most of the}} positional and temporal information from the overlying ectoderm for skeletal initiation and growth. In this study, we characterize {{the function of the}} novel gene strim 1, which encodes a tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein, that adds to the list of genes constituting the <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> network. We report that strim 1 is expressed in ectoderm regions adjacent to the bilateral clusters of PMCs and that its misexpression leads to severe skeletal abnormalities. Reciprocally, knock down of strim 1 function abrogates PMC positioning and blocks skeletogenesis. Blastomere transplantation experiments establish that the defects in PMC patterning, number and skeletal growth depend upon strim 1 misexpression in ectoderm cells. Furthermore, clonal expression of strim 1 into knocked down embryos locally restores skeletogenesis. We also provide evidence that the Otp and Pax 2 / 5 / 8 regulators, as well as FGFA, but not VEGF, ligand act downstream to strim 1 in ectoderm cells, and that strim 1 triggers the expression of the PMC marker sm 30, an ectoderm-signaling dependent gene. We conclude that the strim 1 function elicits specific gene expression both in ectoderm cells and PMCs to guide the skeletal biomineralization during morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The mouse limb {{deformity}} (ld) mutations cause limb malformations by disrupting <b>epithelial–mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> {{between the}} polarizing {{region and the}} apical ectodermal ridge. Formin was proposed as the relevant gene because {{three of the five}} ld alleles disrupt its C-terminal domain. In contrast, our studies establish that the two other ld alleles directly disrupt the neighboring Gremlin gene, corroborating the requirement of this BMP antagonist for limb morphogenesis. Further doubts concerning an involvement of Formin in the ld limb phenotype are cast, as a targeted mutation removing the C-terminal Formin domain by frame shift does not affect embryogenesis. In contrast, the deletion of the corresponding genomic region reproduces the ld limb phenotype and is allelic to mutations in Gremlin. We resolve these conflicting results by identifying a cis-regulatory region within the deletion that is required for Gremlin activation in the limb bud mesenchyme. This distant cis-regulatory region within Formin is also altered by three of the ld mutations. Therefore, the ld limb bud patterning defects are not caused by disruption of Formin, but by alteration of a global control region (GCR) required for Gremlin transcription. Our studies reveal the large genomic landscape harboring this GCR, which is required for tissue-specific coexpression of two structurally and functionally unrelated genes...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mice {{lacking the}} {{activities}} of Dlx 1 and Dlx 2 (Dlx 1 / 2 -/-) exhibit cleft palate, {{one of the most}} common human congenital defects, but the etiology behind this phenotype has been unknown. Therefore, we analyzed the morphological, cellular, and molecular changes caused by inactivation of Dlx 1 and Dlx 2 as related to palate development. RESULTS: Dlx 1 / 2 -/- mutants exhibited lack of vertical growth in the posterior palate during the earliest stage of palatogenesis. We attributed this growth deficiency to reduced cell proliferation. Expression of a cell cycle regulator Ccnd 1 was specifically down-regulated in the same region. Previous studies established that the <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> loop involving Shh, Bmp 4, and Fgf 10 is important for cell proliferation and tissue growth during palate development. This signaling loop was disrupted in Dlx 1 / 2 -/- palate. Interestingly, however, the decreases in Ccnd 1 expression and mitosis in Dlx 1 / 2 -/- mutants were independent of this signaling loop. Finally, Dlx 1 / 2 activity was required for normal expression of several transcription factor genes whose mutation results in palate defects. CONCLUSIONS: The functions of Dlx 1 and Dlx 2 are crucial for the initial formation of the posterior palatal shelves, and that the Dlx genes lie upstream of multiple signaling molecules and transcription factors important for later stages of palatogenesis...|$|R

However, it was unknown whether Math 1 is sufficient to induce the program of secretory cell differentiation. To examine the function of Math 1 in the differentiation of intestinal epithelial cells, intestinal morphology and epithelial and mesenchymal cell fate were examined by histological staining and marker gene expression in transgenic mice expressing a villin-regulated Math 1 transgene. Late prenatal transgenic founders exhibited a gross cellular transformation into a secretory epithelium. The expansion of secretory cells coupled with the almost complete loss of absorptive enterocytes suggested reprogramming of a bipotential progenitor cell. Moreover, Math 1 expression inhibited epithelial cell proliferation, as demonstrated by a marked reduction in Ki 67 positive cells and blunted villi. Unexpectedly, the transgenic mesenchyme was greatly expanded with increased proliferation. Several mesenchymal cell types were amplified, including smooth muscle and neurons, with maintenance of basic radial patterning. Since transgenic Math 1 expression was restricted to the epithelium, these findings suggest that <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> is altered by the cellular changes induced by Math 1. Thus, Math 1 is a key effector directing multipotential precursors to adopt secretory and not absorptive cell fate...|$|R

The molecular pathways that regulate {{the development of this}} heterogenous group of cells from mesenchymal precursors are poorly understood. Here, we identified epithelial Wnt 7 a and Wnt 7 b as possible ligands of Fzd-mediated β-catenin (Ctnnb 1) -dependent (canonical) Wnt signaling in the adjacent undifferentiated periotic mesenchyme (POM). Mice with a conditional deletion of Ctnnb 1 in the POM exhibited a complete failure of fibrocyte differentiation, a severe reduction of mesenchymal cells surrounding {{the cochlear}} duct, loss of pericochlear spaces, a thickening and partial loss of the bony capsule and a secondary disturbance of cochlear duct coiling shortly before birth. Analysis at earlier stages revealed that radial patterning of the POM in two domains with highly condensed cartilaginous precursors and more loosely arranged inner mesenchymal cells occurred normally but that proliferation in the inner domain was reduced and cytodifferentiation failed. Cells with mis/overexpression of a stabilized form of Ctnnb 1 in the entire POM mesenchyme sorted to the inner mesenchymal compartment and exhibited increased proliferation. Our analysis suggests that Wnt signals from the cochlear duct epithelium are crucial to induce differentiation and expansion of fibrocyte precursor cells. Our findings emphasize the importance of <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> in inner ear development...|$|R

We hypothesized that the regenerating gut epithelium in inflammatory gut disorders would show an upregulation of SHH/SHH signaling and this abnormal signal may explain the increased incidence of neoplasia in these diseases. Archived healthy gut and inflammatory gut diseased tissues were analyzed by RNA in situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry to describe location and levels of SHH signaling. We show that SHH/SHH and its receptor PTCH 1 /PTCH 1 expression is restricted to the glandular epithelium of the gut, in an antiluminal pattern (strongest in basal layers and weak to absent in luminal epithelium). Inflammatory diseases of the gut show dramatic increases in epithelial SHH signaling. Expression increases in inflamed glandular epithelium (including metaplastic glandular epithelium), losing its radial (crypt-villous) polarity, and expression appears upregulated and present in all epithelial cells. We also describe strong SHH/SHH and PTCH 1 /PTCH 1 expression in intraepithelial and mucosal inflammatory cells. We suggest that SHH signaling in inflammatory diseases of the gut acts to ensure stem cell restitution of damaged mucosal epithelium. However, such signaling may also present a risk for neoplastic transformatio...|$|R
40|$|AbstractT 1 α, a {{differentiation}} gene of lung alveolar epithelial type I cells, is developmentally regulated and encodes an apical {{membrane protein}} of unknown function. Morphological differentiation of type I cells {{to form the}} air-blood barrier starts {{in the last few}} days of gestation and continues postnatally. Although T 1 α is expressed in the foregut endoderm before the lung buds, T 1 α mRNA and protein levels increase substantially in late fetuses when expression is restricted to alveolar type I cells. We generated T 1 α null mutant mice to study the role of T 1 α in lung development and differentiation and to gain insight into its potential function. Homozygous null mice die at birth of respiratory failure, and their lungs cannot be inflated to normal volumes. Distal lung morphology is altered. In the absence of T 1 α protein, type I cell differentiation is blocked, as indicated by smaller airspaces, many fewer attenuated type I cells, and reduced levels of aquaporin- 5 mRNA and protein, a type I cell water channel. Abundant secreted surfactant in the narrowed airspaces, normal levels of surfactant protein mRNAs, and normal patterns and numbers of cells expressing surfactant protein-B suggest that differentiation of type II cells, also alveolar epithelial cells, is normal. Anomalous proliferation of the mesenchyme and epithelium at birth with unchanged numbers of apoptotic cells suggests that loss of T 1 α and/or abnormal morphogenesis of type I cells alter the proliferation rate of distal lung cells, probably by disruption of <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling...</b>|$|R
40|$|Although “fetal {{programming}} ” {{has been}} extensively studied in many organs, there is only limited information on pulmonary effects in the offspring following intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR). We aimed {{to determine the effects}} of nutrient restriction on the lung structure and lung lipid differentiation programs in offspring using an animal mode of maternal food restriction (MFR). We utilized a rodent model of 50 % MFR from day 10 of gestation to term and then using lung morphology, Western blotting, Real Time- RT-PCR and oil red O staining, lung structure and development of the offspring were examined at postnatal days (p) 1, p 21, and 9 months (9 M). At postnatal day 1, MFR pups weighed significantly less compared to control pups, but at p 21 and 9 M, they weighed significantly more. However, lung weight, expressed as a percentage of body weight between the two groups was not different at all time-points examined. The MFR group had significantly decreased alveolar number and significantly increased septal thickness at p 1 and 9 M, indicating significantly altered lung structure in the MFR offspring. Furthermore, although at p 1, compared to the control group, lung lipid accumulation was significantly decreased in the MFR group, at 9 M, it was significantly increased. There were significant temporal changes in the Parathyroid Hormone-related Protein/Peroxisome Proliferator-Activated Receptor gamma signaling pathway and surfactant synthesis. We conclude that MFR alters fetal lung lipid differentiation programming and lung morphometry by affecting specific <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> pathways, offering the possibility for specific interventions to overcome these effects...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTransforming growth factor-beta (TGF-β) {{superfamily}} signaling {{has been}} implicated in many developmental processes, including pancreatic development. Previous studies are conflicting with regard to an exact role for TGF-β signaling in various aspects of pancreatic organogenesis. Here we have investigated the role of TGF-β isoform signaling in embryonic pancreas differentiation and lineage selection. The TGF-β isoform receptors (RI, RII and ALK 1) were localized mainly to both the pancreatic epithelium and mesenchyme at early stages of development, but then with increasing age localized to the pancreatic islets and ducts. To determine the specific role of TGF-β isoforms, we functionally inactivated TGF-β signaling {{at different points in}} the signaling cascade. Disruption of TGF-β signaling at the receptor level using mice overexpressing the dominant-negative TGF-β type II receptor showed an increase in endocrine precursors and proliferating endocrine cells, with an abnormal accumulation of endocrine cells around the developing ducts of mid–late stage embryonic pancreas. This pattern suggested that TGF-β isoform signaling may suppress the origination of secondary transition endocrine cells from the ducts. Secondly, TGF-β isoform ligand inhibition with neutralizing antibody in pancreatic organ culture also led to {{an increase in the number}} of endocrine-positive cells. Thirdly, hybrid mix-and-match in vitro recombinations of transgenic pancreatic mesenchyme and wild-type epithelium also led to increased endocrine cell differentiation, but with different patterns depending on the directionality of the <b>epithelial–mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling.</b> Together these results suggest that TGF-β signaling is important for restraining the growth and differentiation of pancreatic epithelial cells, particularly away from the endocrine lineage. Inhibition of TGF-β signaling in the embryonic period may thus allow pancreatic epithelial cells to progress towards the endocrine lineage unchecked, particularly as part of the secondary transition of pancreatic endocrine cell development. TGF-β RII in the ducts and islets may normally serve to downregulate the production of beta cells from embryonic ducts...|$|R
40|$|Airway {{inflammation}} and epithelial remodeling are two key features of asthma. IL- 13 and other cytokines produced during T helper type 2 cell-driven allergic inflammation contribute to airway epithelial goblet cell metaplasia and may alter <b>epithelial–mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling,</b> leading to increased subepithelial fibrosis or hyperplasia of smooth muscle. The beneficial effects of corticosteroids in asthma {{could relate to}} their ability to directly or indirectly decrease epithelial cell activation by inflammatory cells and cytokines. To identify markers of epithelial cell dysfunction and the effects of corticosteroids on epithelial cells in asthma, we studied airway epithelial cells collected from asthmatic subjects enrolled in a randomized controlled trial of inhaled corticosteroids, from healthy subjects and from smokers (disease control). By using gene expression microarrays, we found that chloride channel, calcium-activated, family member 1 (CLCA 1), periostin, and serine peptidase inhibitor, clade B (ovalbumin), member 2 (serpinB 2) were up-regulated in asthma but not in smokers. Corticosteroid treatment down-regulated expression of these three genes and markedly up-regulated expression of FK 506 -binding protein 51 (FKBP 51). Whereas high baseline expression of CLCA 1, periostin, and serpinB 2 was associated with a good clinical response to corticosteroids, high expression of FKBP 51 was associated with a poor response. By using airway epithelial cells in culture, we found that IL- 13 increased expression of CLCA 1, periostin, and serpinB 2, an effect that was suppressed by corticosteroids. Corticosteroids also induced expression of FKBP 51. Taken together, our findings show that airway epithelial cells in asthma have a distinct activation profile and identify direct and cell-autonomous effects of corticosteroid treatment on airway epithelial cells that relate to treatment responses and can now be the focus of specific mechanistic studies...|$|R
40|$|The {{extent to}} which cell {{signaling}} is integrated outside the cell is not currently appreciated. We show that {{a member of the}} low-density receptor-related protein family, Lrp 4 modulates and integrates Bmp and canonical Wnt signalling during tooth morphogenesis by binding the secreted Bmp antagonist protein Wise. Mouse mutants of Lrp 4 and Wise exhibit identical tooth phenotypes that include supernumerary incisors and molars, and fused molars. We propose that the Lrp 4 /Wise interaction acts as an extracellular integrator of <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> cell <b>signaling.</b> Wise, secreted from mesenchyme cells binds to BMP’s and also to Lrp 4 that is expressed on epithelial cells. This binding then results in the modulation of Wnt activity in the epithelial cells. Thus in this context Wise acts as an extracellular signaling molecule linking two signalin...|$|R
40|$|SummaryAlterations in estrogen-mediated {{cellular}} signaling play {{an essential}} role in the pathogenesis of endometriosis. In addition to higher estrogen receptor (ER) β levels, enhanced ERβ activity was detected in endometriotic tissues, and the inhibition of enhanced ERβ activity by an ERβ-selective antagonist suppressed mouse ectopic lesion growth. Notably, gain of ERβ function stimulated the progression of endometriosis. As a mechanism to evade endogenous immune surveillance for cell survival, ERβ interacts with cellular apoptotic machinery in the cytoplasm to inhibit TNF-α-induced apoptosis. ERβ also interacts with components of the cytoplasmic inflammasome to increase interleukin- 1 β and thus enhance its cellular adhesion and proliferation properties. Furthermore, this gain of ERβ function enhances <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> transition <b>signaling,</b> thereby increasing the invasion activity of endometriotic tissues for establishment of ectopic lesions. Collectively, we reveal how endometrial tissue generated by retrograde menstruation can escape immune surveillance and develop into sustained ectopic lesions via gain of ERβ function...|$|R
40|$|Tooth {{development}} {{provides a}} dynamic {{process that has}} recently been studied at molecular level. There has been much progress toward the understanding of <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> cell <b>signaling</b> in tooth germ formation, morphogenesis and cell differentiation. The epithelial-mesenchym interaction is suggested {{to be the most}} important mechanism in organogenesis that stimulate mitosis and prevent apoptosis adjacent to the tissue surface. Moreover it affects cell formation and cell differentiation. Enamel knot is assumed to act as a signaling center in the tooth germ epithelial in organizing the tooth pattern as well as controlling the tooth growth. The genes involved in this mechanism are p 21, Fgf- 4, Shh, Bmp- 2, bmp- 4, Msx- 1 and Lef- 1 which are expressed in the enamel knot during the bud stage and cap stage. At the further step of differentiation, epithelial ameloblast and mesenchymal odontoblast will deposit organic matrix in enamel and dentin.

40|$|The {{mammary gland}} {{undergoes}} morphogenesis {{through the entire}} reproductive life of mammals. In mice, ductal outgrowth from the nipple across the fat pad results in an intricate, well spaced ductal tree that further ramifies and develops alveolar structures during pregnancy. Ductal morphogenesis is regulated by the concerted action of circulating steroid and polypeptide hormones, and local <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> inductive <b>signals.</b> Transforming growth factor (TGF) -β 1 - 3 and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) /scatter factor (SF) are important components of this latter signaling pathway. TGF-β 1 and TGF-β 3 have roles in both promotion and inhibition of branching morphogenesis that are dependent on concentration and context. HGF/SF promotes ductal outgrowth and tubule formation in the mammary gland. These data suggest that these two growth factors have complementary roles in promoting mammary ductal morphogenesis and in maintaining ductal spacing. In addition, TGF-β 3 triggers apoptosis in the alveolar epithelia, which is a necessary component of mammary gland involution and return of the ductal structure to a virgin-like state after lactation...|$|R
40|$|The {{building}} of the skeleton in the indirect developing sea urchin embryo is a complex morphogenetic process that is executed by the Primary Mesenchyme Cells or PMCs (Ettensohn et al, 1997; Wilt 2002). It {{is well known that}} the PMCs acquire most of the positional and temporal information from the overlying ectoderm for skeletal initiation and growth (Armstrong 1993; Cavalieri et al, 2003; Röttinger et al, 2008). In this study, we analyze the function of a novel gene, encoding for a tripartite motif-containing (TRIM) protein denoted strim 1, that adds up to the list of genes constituting the <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> <b>signaling</b> network. We show that strim 1 is expressed in ectoderm regions adjacent to the bilateral clusters of PMCs. Strim 1 misexpression causes the number of PMCs to double and leads to skeletal abnormalities. By micromere transplantations, we establish that skeletal defects depend upon strim 1 misexpression in ectoderm cells. Reciprocally, knock-down of strim 1 function abrogates PMC migration and blocks skeletogenesis. Identical phenotype is shown by chimeras in which strim 1 function is blocked selectively in the ectoderm. We also show that clonal expression of strim 1 into ectoderm cells from knocked-down embryos restores the correct skeletogenic program. Finally, we report that strim 1 triggers the expression of the ectodermspecific gene pax 2 / 5 / 8, and the PMC marker sm 30 (an ectoderm signaling dependent gene). We conclude that strim 1 function is able to elicit specific gene expression both in ectoderm cells and PMCs to guide the biomineralization during morphogenesis.

40|$|BMP {{signaling}} is pivotal {{for normal}} limb bud development in vertebrate embryos and genetic analysis of receptors and ligands in the mouse revealed their requirement in both mesenchymal and ectodermal limb bud compartments. In this study, we genetically assessed the potential essential functions of SMAD 4, a mediator of canonical BMP/TGFss signal transduction, in the mouse limb bud ectoderm. Msx 2 -Cre {{was used to}} conditionally inactivate Smad 4 in the ectoderm of fore- and hindlimb buds. In hindlimb buds, the Smad 4 inactivation disrupts the establishment and signaling by the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) from early limb bud stages onwards, which results in severe hypoplasia and/or aplasia of zeugo- and autopodal skeletal elements. In contrast, the developmentally later inactivation of Smad 4 in forelimb buds does not alter AER formation and <b>signaling,</b> but prolongs <b>epithelial-mesenchymal</b> feedback <b>signaling</b> in advanced limb buds. The late termination of SHH and AER-FGF signaling delays distal progression of digit ray formation and inhibits interdigit apoptosis. In summary, our genetic analysis reveals the temporally and functionally distinct dual requirement of ectodermal Smad 4 during initiation and termination of AER signaling...|$|R

We identified 132 differentially expressed proteins, among them, 53 proteins were upregulated and 79 proteins were downregulated.
