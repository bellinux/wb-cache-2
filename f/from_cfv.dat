40|$|The {{bacterium}} Campylobacter fetus (C. fetus) {{can cause}} disease in humans and animals. In humans, C. fetus can cause septicemia and intestinal illness. Contaminated food, like unpasteurized milk, is possibly {{a source of}} human C. fetus infections. This thesis focuses on the mammal-associated C. fetus subsp. fetus (Cff) and C. fetus subsp. venerealis (Cfv). Cfv is described as the causative agent of Bovine Genital Campylobacteriosis (BGC), a syndrome characterized by infertility and abortion in cattle. Cff and Cfv can be differentiated with two biochemical tests. Nowadays, the BGC control programs focus only on Cfv and not Cff, while it is described that Cff can also cause abortions in cattle. The aim of this thesis was to study the molecular characteristics of the C. fetus strains. Furthermore, we studied if we could associate the molecular characteristics with the virulence of the strains. It is known that the biochemical tests used to differentiate Cfv and Cfv are not always reliable. In this study, we tested all available molecular methods and showed {{that none of these}} methods could reliable differentiate the C. fetus strains. To improve current diagnostics, we developed a novel PCR assay, which was able to differentiate Cff <b>from</b> <b>Cfv</b> strains reliable. During the study, C. fetus strains were sequenced and we determined the molecular characteristics. The classification of the strains based on the molecular characteristics was not consistent with the classification based on the biochemical tests. The BGC control programs use the biochemical tests to differentiate between Cff and Cfv, while this differentiation cannot be associated with the virulence of the strains. It is more important for the BGC control programs to differentiate between virulent and non-virulent C. fetus strains. Therefore, we studied the presence of type IV secretions systems (T 4 SSs), a potential virulence factor, in the strains and revealed that C. fetus strains can contain multiple T 4 SSs, which were not Cfv-specific, but also found in Cff strains. The results of this thesis showed that the classification of C. fetus strains based on their molecular characteristics was not consistent with the biochemical characteristics of the strains. Furthermore, it was revealed in this study that Cfv has recently diversified from a Cff ancestor, indicating that Cfv is most likely not a different subspecies, but more likely a Cff clone restricted to the genital tract of cattle. In the C. fetus strains, several potential virulence factors were identified, including T 4 SSs, but we could not associate these factors with the clinical characteristics of strains. Further research is necessary to unravel the role of the potential virulence factors in C. fetus pathogenesis...|$|E
40|$|The {{critical}} flow venturi (CFV) has long been recognized as a high quality gas flow calibration artifact. A program is underway to compile data {{to be used in}} determining the intrinsic repeatability and reproducibility of a CFV. This paper describes the initial results of the program, it is divided into three parts. First, primary calibration data <b>from</b> a single <b>CFV</b> are tracked over a 30 year period. Second, results of a test program are presented with the objective of classifying short and long term random effects. Third, results from two test programs are presented with the objective of identifying the source of random effects. REPEATABILITY AND REPRODUCIBILITY One objective {{of this paper is to}} present data in support of estimated values for both repeatability and reproducibility. What is the difference between these two terms? Repeatability is a measure of the dispersion of a series of measurements made under the exact same conditions. Reproducibility is a measure of the dispersion of a series of measurements made under similar conditions. One “condition ” that differentiates betwee...|$|R
40|$|Objective-To {{compare the}} {{recovery}} rates of Campylobacter fetus subsp venerealis (<b>Cfv)</b> <b>from</b> preputial scrapings of infected bulls with passive filtration on selective medium versus nonselective medium, {{with and without}} transport medium. Samples- 217 preputial scrapings from 12 bulls (4 naturally and 8 artificially infected with Cfv). Procedures-Preputial scrapings were collected in 2 mL of PBS solution and bacteriologically cultured directly on Skirrow medium or passively filtered through 0. 65 -μm filters onto blood agar, with or without 24 hour preincubation in modified Weybridge transport enrichment medium (TEM). After 72 hours, plates were examined for Cfv and bacterial and fungal contamination or overgrowth. Results-Passive filtration of fresh preputial scrapings onto blood agar yielded significantly higher recovery rates of Cfv (86 %) than direct plating on Skirrow medium (32 %), whereas recovery from TEM was poor for both media (35 % and 40 %, respectively). Skirrow cultures without TEM {{were significantly more likely}} to have fungal contamination than were cultures performed with any other technique, and fungal contamination was virtually eliminated by passive filtration onto blood agar. Bacterial contamination by Pseudomonas spp was significantly more common with Skirrow medium versus passive filtration on blood agar, regardless of TEM use. Conclusions and Clinical Relevance-The use of transport medium and the choice of culture medium had significant effects on Cfv recovery and culture contamination rates from clinical samples. Both factors should be considered when animals are tested for this pathogen...|$|R
40|$|The {{detection}} and subspeciation of Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis (<b>CFV)</b> <b>from</b> veterinary samples {{is important for}} both clinical and economic reasons. Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis is the causative agent of bovine genital campylobacteriosis, a venereal disease {{that can lead to}} serious reproductive problems in cattle, and strict international regulations require animals and animal products to be CFV-free for trade. This study evaluated methods reported in the literature for CFV {{detection and}} reports the translation of an extensively tested CFV-specific polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primer set; including the VenSF/VenSR primers and a real-time, quantitative PCR (qPCR) platform using SYBR Green chemistry. Three methods of preputial sample preparation for direct qPCR were evaluated and a heat lysis DNA extraction method was shown to allow for CFV detection at the level of approximately one cell equivalent per reaction (or 1. 0 × 103 CFU/mL) from prepuce. The optimized sample preparation and qPCR protocols were then used to evaluate 3 western Canadian bull cohorts, which included 377 bulls, for CFV. The qPCR assay detected 11 positive bulls for the CFV-specific parA gene target. DNA sequence data confirmed the identity of the amplified product and revealed that positive samples were comprised of 2 sequence types; one identical to previously reported CFV parA gene sequences and one with a 9 % sequence divergence. These results add valuable information towards our understanding of an important CFV subspeciation target and offer a significantly improved format for an internationally recognized PCR test...|$|R
40|$|The RFV {{strain of}} the Friend virus complex induces an {{erythroleukemia}} that spontaneously regresses. The tropism of regressing Friend virus complex (RFV), which is conferred by its helper MuLV component, MuLV- RF, {{is different from that}} of the conventional virus strain, CFV. RFV is NB-tropic and CFV is N-tropic. Passage of nonregressing CFV through Fv- 1 incompatible Swiss/ICR mice changed the tropism of <b>CFV</b> <b>from</b> N to NB and resulted in a virus strain which induced erythroleukemia that regressed. Passage of NB-tropic CFV back through Fv- 1 compatible mice maintained NB-tropism and regression. Altering the quantity or type of helper MuLV in RFV complex by addition of Ri-MuLV inhibited regression in proportion to the amount of added Ri-MuLV. These studies indicate a relationship between a change in virus tropism to NB by passage in certain hosts (e. g., Swiss/ICR mice) and the ability of Friend virus to induce erythroleukemia that spontaneously regresses. MuLV-RF isolated from the RFV complex induced lymphocytic leukemia in newborn mice which regressed and caused the regression of CFV-induced erythroleukemia. MuLV-RF is NB-tropic, contains no spleen focus-forming virus (SFFV) activity and helps SFFV form spleen foci in genetically restrictive mice. Pseudotype viruses were prepared, consisting of MuLV-RF, or other MuLV's, and SFFV derived from FV-B. The pseudotype viruses each acquired the tropism of the MuLV used in rescue. The pseudotype prepared with MuLV-RF or another NB-tropic MuLV-F, but not the virus obtained by rescue with N-tropic MuLV-F, induced erythroleukemia that spontaneously regressed. These studies demonstrate that the ability of RFV to induce erythroleukemia that spontaneously regresses is due to its helper MuLV component...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjective: Endovascular {{placement}} of prosthetic valves {{is currently in}} clinical trials as treatment for lower extremity venous hypertension caused by valvular insufficiency. Femoropopliteal vein sizing is {{a critical factor in}} treatment planning. A wide diameter range could influence selection of an endoprosthesis. Quantitative data describing intrasubject vein diameter variation are scant. We measured vein diameters with ultrasound imaging to assess minimum-maximum diameter range under forced conditions of venoconstriction and venodilatation. Methods: Diameter of the common femoral vein (CFV), proximal femoral vein (PFV), mid-femoral vein (MFV), and distal femoral vein (DFV) in the thigh and the popliteal vein (PV) was measured in the morning under conditions of minimal venodilation and in the afternoon under conditions of stressed venodilatation that included activities of daily living and a 5 -minute treadmill walk. Measurements were obtained twice on two different days in both extremities in 20 subjects with CEAP clinical classification C 0 (n = 10), C 3 (n = 7), C 4 (n = 1), or C 5 (n = 2). Results: Average vein diameter increased, from 11. 2 ± 2. 5 (SD) mm to 14. 5 ± 2. 3 mm at the <b>CFV,</b> <b>from</b> 6. 9 ± 1. 8 mm to 9. 4 ± 1. 9 mm at the PFV, from 6. 9 ± 1. 6 mm to 9. 0 ± 1. 8 mm at the MFV, from 7. 3 ± 1. 7 mm to 9. 1 ± 1. 5 mm at the DFV, and from 8. 4 ± 1. 4 mm to 9. 7 ± 1. 8 mm at the PV (P <. 001 for all differences). Maximum diameter change was 8. 2 mm at the CFV, 7. 0 mm at the PFV, 6. 6 mm at the MFV, 6. 0 mm at the DFV, and 5. 1 mm at the PV. Dilatation of 4 mm or greater occurred in 43 % of CFV, 15 % of PFV, 11 % of MFV, 3 % of DFV, and 1 % of PV. Minimum vein diameter was found at PFV in 41 %, MFV in 34 %, and DFV in 23 % of morning measurements and at PFV in 21 %, MFV in 38 %, DFV in 28 %, and PV in 16 % of afternoon measurements. Conclusions: Femoropopliteal veins demonstrated a wide range of diameters, and significant diameter changes were detected in all vein segments. Variations in vein diameter must be evaluated in candidates for endovascular venous valve prostheses. Such devices must adapt to a wide range in vein diameter.

40|$|TEE-Doppler from LAD artery {{combined}} with pharmacologically induced coronary hyperemia represents a promising {{tool for the}} evaluation of coronary reserve in man; however, standard protocols for this technique are still lacking. Aim of the studywas to compare the coronary vasodilator response to i. v. infusion of Adenosine (ADN) and Dipyridamole (DIP) in patients with coronary reserve impairment of different origin and in normal controls (NL). Patients and MethodsTwelve NL, 14 normotensive pts with angiographically proven CAD and LAD stenosis ≤ 50 %, and 8 pts with LVH secondary to arterial hypertension and angiographically normal coronary arteries were investigated. Coronary flow velocity (<b>CFV)</b> <b>from</b> LAD artery was monitored by TEE-Doppler, together with 12 -lead ECG and serial BP measurements (1 -min intervals), at baseline and during sequential i. v. infusion of ADN (0. 140 μg/kg/min for 5 min) and DIP (DIP-I: 0. 56 mg/kg/ 4 min, followed after 2 min by DIP-II: 0. 28 mg/kg/ 2 min); a 5 -min interval was allowed between ADN and DIP infusions. Mean total CFV at baseline, at peak-ADN, and after DIP-I and DIP-II was determined, and the correspondent indexes of coronary resistance were calculated. ResultsBP. HR and CFV before ADN and DIP infusions were comparable in each group.

40|$|Gum arabic is {{a natural}} product used widely in the food {{industry}} as an emulsifier and stabilising agent. The gum contains 3 main fractions: an arabinogalactan (~ 80 wt%; AG) fraction, a glycoprotein (~ 2 wt%; GP) fraction and an arabinogalactan-protein complex (~ 18 wt%; AGP). This AGP fraction is {{largely responsible for the}} functional properties of gum arabic and, due to natural variation, the proportion of AGP within a gum arabic batch varies enormously. There is industrial interest, therefore, in fractionating the gum arabic to allow creation of a more homogenous product, as well as new products for the food industry. The aim of this work was to investigate the feasibility of using membrane technology to fractionate gum arabic. Polymeric membranes were used initially and showed success at rejection of AGP by size exclusion. Polysulfone membranes of 0. 1, 0. 5 and 0. 8 μm nominal pore size were employed and the rejection of AGP was seen to decrease with increasing pore size, but the overall transmission of solids was seen to increase. Beneficial fouling was observed with the larger two pore sizes, which allowed greater fractionation after a fouling layer had developed. It was hypothesised that the 0. 1 μm PS membrane was fouled by mainly cake formation, whereas the 0. 5 and 0. 8 μm PS membranes were subject to more in pore fouling. The critical flux of gum arabic was measured for these three pore sized membranes and was found to be highest (27 L m- 2 h- 1) for the 0. 1 μm PS membrane. This was attributed to the lack of in pore fouling, which the 0. 5 and 0. 8 μm membranes suffered and resulted in fouling occurring at lower fluxes for these membranes; the critical fluxes for these membranes was found to be 15 and 22 L m- 2 h- 1, respectively Increasing the crossflow velocity (<b>CFV)</b> <b>from</b> 0. 18 to 0. 67 m s- 1 was found to increase the critical flux. Filtration experiments above and below the critical flux for each pore size demonstrated the efficiency of operating below the critical flux, as operation could be sustained for much longer periods (up to 4 h was tested) without the need for cleaning cycles. It also demonstrated the beneficial effect of the fouling layer with the 0. 5 iii and 0. 8 μm membranes, which showed little or no fractionation during operation below the critical flux. Finally, filtration studies were carried out with 3 different membrane materials and detailed surface analysis was performed to explain the differences in performance observed. Both polysulfone and fluoropolymer membranes were fairly hydrophobic, with contact angles of between 70 and 90 º, and showed very high overall rejection of solids. High transmission of solids is required together with good rejection of AGP for an effective fractionation process. Hydrophilic cellulose acetate, however, showed very high transmission of gum arabic (~ 75 %), but no rejection of AGP. Overall, the work has shown that fractionation of gum arabic with membranes is feasible using polysulfone membranes, but that further work is needed to optimise the separation. Higher transmission of the GP and AG are required whilst maintaining rejection of the AGP...|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} {{method for}} {{the diagnosis of}} bovine genital campylobacteriosis is the culture and identification of the causative organism, Campylobacter fetus subsp. venerealis (<b>Cfv)</b> <b>from</b> the genital tract. This approach is considered relatively insensitive due to {{the fragility of the}} bacteria, their specific nutritional and atmospheric requirements and their being easily overgrown by commensal bacteria. The identification of isolates is also problematic due to the limited biochemical activity of the bacteria. With the rapid advances made in the molecular field, assays have become more robust and cost-effective making them feasible for the diagnostic laboratory. The potential speed, sensitivity and specificity offered by these assays provide attractive alternatives for the identification of pathogens which are notoriously difficult to identify. The first part of this investigation was concerned with the implementation and evaluation of a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay for the direct detection of C. fetus in bovine preputial specimens. The specificity of a published C. fetus-specific primer pair was established by testing C. fetus reference and field isolates in addition to a collection of other Campylobacter species and organisms which may encountered in the genital tract of cattle. All C. fetus isolates tested yielded a single PCR amplicon of approximately 750 bp. No amplicons were generated when any of the other non-C. fetus isolates were tested. Following minor modifications to the assay, the sensitivity of the assay was determined using spiked Weybridge medium. A detection limit of 615 Cfv/mR Weybridge medium (or 6, 15 cell equivalents per PCR assay) was obtained. Preputial material collected and submitted for laboratory testing may often be contaminated with faeces, urine, semen and/or blood. All of these components are known to be potential PCR inhibitors and the influence of each, on the sensitivity of the PCR assay, was subsequently evaluated. Faeces were identified as a potent inhibitor and contamination of specimens with as little as 1 % (w/v) faeces reduced the sensitivity of the assay. Concentrations of up to 50 % (v/v) of blood, urine and semen had no effect on the sensitivity of the assay. Preputial specimens, collected in Weybridge medium, were subsequently pooled and spiked and used to establish the sensitivity of both the PCR and culture methods as well as determine the influence of time on the sensitivity of the assays. Testing was carried out in triplicate on samples collected from different herds which were ascertained to be free of Cfv based on the use of specific selection criteria. The detection limit of the culture method was found to be better than that achieved using PCR only immediately after the samples were spiked. The detection limit of the culture method decreased with time whilst the detection limit of the PCR assay remain unchanged up to 72 hours post-inoculation. Ensuing field evaluation involved the testing of 212 clinical samples using both the culture method and the optimized PCR assay. Of the samples tested 4, 2 % were found to be positive using the PCR assay, whilst only 3, 8 % were found to be positive by culture. Based upon this evaluation the analytical specificity of the PCR assay was calculated to be 99 % and the analytical sensitivity, 85, 7 %. The second part of this investigation was concerned with the subspeciation of C. fetus isolates. Currently the only test recommended by the Office International des Epizooties (OIE) for the subspeciation of isolates, is tolerance to 1 % glycine. Doubts over the reliability of this test have led to alternative or supplementary tests being sought. Within the context of this investigation a collection of 40 South African field isolates were subspeciated using a previously described subspecies-specific primer set as well as the traditional 1 % glycine tolerance phenotyping test. Additionally, other phenotyping tests (selenite reduction, growth at 42 °C and susceptibility to metronidazole and cefoperazone) were evaluated to determine their suitability for use as an aid in the subspeciation of C. fetus isolates. None of the field isolates yielded a Cfv-specific subspecies PCR amplicon using the published primer set suggesting that all of the isolates were Campylobacter fetus subsp. fetus (Cff). Based on tolerance to 1 % glycine however, only 6 isolates were identified as Cff (glycine tolerant), whilst the remainder were classified as Cfv. The results of the ‘sensitive’ hydrogen sulphide test indicated that the Cfv isolates were specifically Cfv biovar intermedius. The lack of agreement between the PCR and the phenotyping subspeciation results concur with the findings reported by other researchers. It is consequently concluded that the published VenSF/VenSR subspecies-primer set is unsuitable for the subspeciation of South African field isolates.
