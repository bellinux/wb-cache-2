40|$|Object range data provide {{valuable}} information in recognition and modeling applications. Therefore, {{it is extremely}} important to reliably extract the range data from a given object. There are various range scanners based on different principles. Among these, structured light based range scanners deserve spacial attention. In these systems, coded light stripes are projected onto the object. Using the bending of these light stripes on the object and the triangulation principle, range information can be obtained. Since this method is simple and fast, it is used in most <b>industrial</b> <b>range</b> scanners. Unfortunately, these range scanners can not scan shiny objects reliably. The main reason is either highlights on the shiny object or the ambient light in the environment. These disturb the coding by illumination. As the code is changed, the range data extracted from {{it will also be}} disturbed. In this study, we propose a color invariant based binary coded structured light range scanner to solve this problem. The color invariant used can eliminate the effects of highlights on the object and the ambient light from the environment. This way, we can extract the range data of shiny objects in a robust manner.

A moving mesh approach was adopted to model the screw dynamics inside the press barrel and a modified version of OpenFoam solver was developed. Rheological test and numerical simulations reciprocally validate each others: errors in rheological characterization would results in errors in numerical results, while wrong numerical modeling would not match experimental extrusion data.

Yet, there is at present a lack of knowledge regarding void closure mechanisms and there is no reliable model that can accurately predict void closure. The main aim of this work is to develop a highly accurate mean field model able to predict the evolution of the voids volume after each forming stage. This proposed model is accounting for both stress triaxiality ratio Tx and Lode angle θ in order to override the hypothesis of axisymmetric loading, which is generally considered in the existing models handling void closure in the literature. Based on an advanced multiscale approach, this model also accounts for voids shape and orientation. An optimization method, using a database of explicit RVE simulations, is developed in order to calibrate the new proposed model. Several void morphological parameters and an <b>industrial</b> <b>range</b> of mechanical loading parameters are analyzed regarding void closure. The proposed mean field model is validated by comparison with explicit full field simulations and with a recent pre-existing mean field model, named Cicaporo 1 model hereafter (Saby et al., 2015 [19]).

The AD 677 circuitry is segmented onto two monolithic chips— a digital control chip fabricated on Analog Devices DSP CMOS process and an analog ADC chip fabricated on our BiMOS II process. Both chips are contained in a single package. The AD 677 is specified for ac (or “dynamic”) parameters such as S/(N+D) Ratio, THD and IMD which are important in signal processing applications. In addition, dc parameters are specified which are important in measurement applications. The AD 677 operates from + 5 V and ± 12 V supplies and typically consumes 450 mW using a 10 V reference (360 mW with 5 V reference) during conversion. The digital supply (VDD) is separated from the analog supplies (VCC, VEE) for reduced digital crosstalk.

40|$|Because of {{the strict}} {{legislation}} for currently applied solvents {{in the industrial}} extraction of caprolactam, being benzene, toluene and chlorinated hydrocarbons, a need exists for alternative, environmentally benign solvents. An experimental screening procedure consisting of several steps {{was used to determine}} a suitable replacement solvent. (1) The distribution ratio of caprolactam was investigated at 293 K for an initial 10 mass% aqueous caprolactam solution; (2) the capacity and mutual solvent solubility were determined as function of the aqueous caprolactam concentration at equilibrium for solvents or solvent mixtures showing favourable capacities compared to benzene and toluene; (3) the equilibrium phase compositions for conditions covering the full <b>industrial</b> <b>range</b> were determined and correlated using the NRTL model for solvents or mixtures showing favourable characteristics compared to benzene and toluene; (4) the physical properties, being density and viscosity data of the separate phases and interfacial tension data of the liquid–liquid systems were determined and correlated for the remaining candidate solvents.

Based on a high capacity, a low mutual solvent solubility and beneficial physical properties the solvent mixture of 40 mass% heptanol in heptane was finally selected as replacement solvent. Calculating the solvent to feed ratio (S/F) and the number of theoretical stages (NTS) needed to reach the industrially required raffinate concentrations, it was found that in the forward extraction the S/F is 3. 0 for the mixed solvent and benzene, whereas the NTS is 5 and 9, respectively.

40|$|Drying {{of paper}} by {{impinging}} jets of superheated steam was studied in an apparatus which closely simulates {{conditions for a}} potential industrial impingement dryer. Drying was found to consist in a constant rate period, followed by a falling rate period where the drying rate decreases linearly with moisture content. The relation found between the constant rate and Reynolds number and temperature of the jet {{is consistent with a}} previous correlation for air impingement heat transfer, suitably modified for conditions in a steam environment. For a given mass flux, steam drying is slower than air drying below an inversion temperature of 175 $ sp circ$C and faster above. The specific blower power for steam drying is much lower than for air drying at temperatures in the <b>industrial</b> <b>range.</b> Equilibrium moisture content measurements showed that complete drying can be obtained at steam temperatures only slightly above the boiling point. Expressions for the critical moisture content in impingement drying in steam and in air were obtained. In steam drying, the falling rate period was found to be determined more by internal transport resistance than by adsorption of water on the fibers. A new arrangement for drying paper, in which {{the first half of the}} drying is done by a conventional dryer to which steam is supplied from a steam impingement dryer handling the second half, was analyzed. In regions with low electricity cost, recirculation of steam around the impingement dryer circuit by a mechanical fan is much more economical than by a thermocompressor. However, this advantage is only marginal where electricity cost is high. The overall performance is optimized by using the highest temperature and lowest jet velocity possible.

40|$|Some of {{the most}} common unit {{operations}} being used in the chemical industry are based upon packed bed configurations. Multi-tubular catalytic reactors are a prominent example of such systems which are believed by many experts to be the heart of the chemical profession and frequently the most expensive units of the plant. They offer extensive surface area between phases of the matter in a compact physical manner, and also are relatively easy to construct and maintain. The successfuld esign of such systems depends on models, which should describe the processes occurring within the fixed bed and must also be able to accurately represent the intrinsic behaviour of the reactor quantitatively. It is therefore necessary to have good estimates of the associated transport parameters, namely the wall heat transfer coefficient, effective radial and axial thermal conductivity coefficients and radial and axial dispersion coefficients, in order to design efficiently. Unfortunately, the accuracy of the design data for the prediction of these parameters are in doubt. They are considered to be unreliable because of being based on poorly defined packed bed models in terms of structure of the packing. The non-uniformities of voidage in the packing matrix must be appreciated and hence be included in descriptive models of the physical system in order to establish reliable design data. As the roles of modelling and experimentation are complementary, a number of beds comprised of equilateral cylindrical particles were prepared to examine their global and local structural properties, with a view to identifying and characterising features which could be used for prediction purposes. The microstructural details within packed beds were studied by means of an image analyser, so that the local variations of voidage in angular, axial and radial directions could be portrayed. It is only {{on the basis of this}} kind of information that a well-defined description of the bed structure becomes accessible.

The effect of operating variables, including pressure (0. 7 - 3. 5 MPa), temperature (423 - 523 K), mixing speed (13. 3 - 20 Hz), and alumina powder (used as a support for cobalt catalyst) concentration (0 - 50 wt. %) on kLa and C* values were statistically investigated using the Central Composite Statistical design and analysis technique. The data were measured within wide ranges of operating condition covering the <b>industrial</b> <b>range</b> of this Fischer-Tropsch synthesis. The transient physical gas absorption technique {{was used to determine}} kLa under the operating conditions used. The C* values for the four gases in the two liquids used appeared to increase linearly with increasing pressure at constant temperature, i. e., obey Henry's Law over the pressure ranges studied. The C* values were found to decrease and then increase with increasing temperature and the effect of temperature on C* was described by an Arrhenius-type equation, where the apparent activation energy of absorption was a function of temperature. The solubility values for the four gases in the two liquids used followed the trend: C*CO>C*N 2 >C*H 2 >C*He and the values in Sasol wax were slightly higher than obtained those in PAO- 8. The kLa values for the four gases in the two liquids were found to increase with increasing pressure, temperature and mixing speed. The kLa values, however, slightly decreased (20 %) at solid concentrations less than 30 wt% and then dramatically decreased (80 %) with increasing solid concentrations from 30 to 50 wt%. Under similar operating conditions, kLa values for the four gases were found to be higher in Sasol wax than in PAO- 8. This behavior was related to the greater gas-liquid interfacial area created in the Sasol wax due to its lower surface tension and foamability when compared with those of the PAO- 8. Statistical correlations were developed to predict the kLa values for the four gases in the two liquids with a regression coefficient (R 2) greater than 97 %. Also, an empirical correlation using dimensionless numbers was proposed to predict kLa values in gas induction slurry agitated reactors with a regression coefficient (R 2) greater than 94 %...|$|E
