The basic model is found to reduce to a boundary value problem with a second-order linear partial differential equation of the hyperbolic type for this range of <b>forcing</b> <b>frequencies.</b> The <b>forced</b> solutions are shown to exhibit resonances with the normal modes of oscillation of the layer. The characteristics of the resonant modes are analyzed in terms of mean tropospheric values of temperature, temperature lapse, wind speed, horizontal and vertical wind shears, latitude, and the frequency and horizontal wavelength of the forcing mechanism. These solutions are compared with solutions to the model for a different (subinertial) range of <b>forcing</b> <b>frequencies.</b> This comparison leads to an elliptic boundary value problem.

[...] The gravitational restoring force from a bend is substantially weaker in finite or inhomogeneous galaxies than in infinite sheets and slabs, {{since there is}} less matter at large distances {{to contribute to the}} restoring force. As a result, the long-wavelength modes are not stabilized by gravity, as implied by the dispersion relation derived above. In these more realistic models, a typical star feels a vertical <b>forcing</b> <b>frequency</b> from a long-wavelength bend that is roughly twice the frequency [...] of its unperturbed orbital motion along the long axis.

50|$|Fatigue {{is related}} to large {{inertial}} forces, and {{is affected by the}} type of motion that a moving part has. A moving part that has a uniform rotation motion is subject to less fatigue than a moving part that oscillates back and forth. Vibration leads to failure when the <b>forcing</b> <b>frequency</b> of the machine's operation hits a resonant frequency of one or more moving parts, such as rotating shafts. Designers avoid this by calculating the natural frequencies of the parts at design time, and altering the parts to limit or eliminate such resonance.|$|E
40|$|Abstract In the {{vertebrate}} spinal cord, a {{neural circuit}} called the central pattern gen-erator produces the basic locomotory rhythm. Short and long distance intersegmental connections serve to maintain coordination {{along the length}} of the body. As a way of examining the influence of such connections, we consider a model of a chain of coupled phase oscillators in which one oscillator receives a periodic forcing stimulus. For a certain range of <b>forcing</b> <b>frequencies,</b> the chain will match the stimulus frequency, a phenomenon called entrainment. Motivated by recent experiments in lampreys, we derive analytical expressions for the range of <b>forcing</b> <b>frequencies</b> that entrain the chain, and how that range depends on the forcing location. For short intersegmental connec-tions, in which an oscillator is connected only to its nearest neighbors, we describe two ways in which entrainment is lost: internally, in which oscillators within the chain n...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} an experimental {{study on the}} dynamics of a ducted, conical, laminar premixed flame subjected to acoustic excitation of varying amplitudes. The flame transfer function is measured over a range of <b>forcing</b> <b>frequencies</b> and equivalence ratios. In keeping with previous works, the measured flame transfer function is in good agreement with that predicted by linear kinematic theory at low amplitudes of acoustic velocity excitation. However, a systematic departure from linear behaviour is observed as the amplitude of the velocity forcing upstream of the flame increases. This non-linearity is mostly in the phase of the transfer function and manifests itself as a roughly constant phase at high forcing amplitude. Nonetheless, as predicted by non-linear kinematic arguments, the response always remains close to linear at low <b>forcing</b> <b>frequencies,</b> regardless of the forcing amplitude. The origin of this phase behaviour is then sought through optical data post-processing...|$|R
40|$|The {{viscoelastic}} {{properties of}} the epoxy surface have been investigated by nano-dynamic mechanical analysis (nano-DMA). Both a Berkovich tip and a conospherical tip were used under the condition of different forces (i. e. different penetration depths) in the frequency range of 10 – 200 Hz. Loss tangent and storage modulus are characteristics that describe the viscoelastic properties. The effect of <b>force</b> <b>frequency,</b> penetration depth and tip shape on the viscoelastic properties is studied and discussed according to the features of microstructures and mobility of molecular chains. The experimental results show important variations when the penetration depth is shallow (< 30 nm). As the depth becomes deeper, the results tend to be stable and become almost constant over 120 nm. The two kinds of indenter tip can cause a slight difference of the storage modulus. A “master curve” of the storage modulus {{as a function of}} <b>force</b> <b>frequency</b> is established...|$|R
