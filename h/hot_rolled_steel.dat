500|$|Colossus's {{movements}} were re-recorded with performer T.J. Storm, as Tricoteux {{had been unable}} to move athletically due to the platform shoes he had to wear on set to replicate the character's height. LaSalle was used for his facial performance. DD then mapped these performances onto a digital model that was designed to be comic-accurate. The team sought specific reference for Colossus's metallic finish to avoid looking [...] "chromey", visiting a metal company to look at various samples. They settled on cold rolled steel, with the darker <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> used for his hair. The model also includes ridges on the character, which could be moved separately {{from the rest of the}} model to keep them always perfectly straight as in the comic books. DD also created the model of Deadpool that was used by all vendors. His mask is animated around the eyes to be expressive as in the comics, which helped balance out the [...] "chinwag" [...] caused by Reynolds' acting coming through the bottom of the mask. Replacing Deadpool's head fully was going to be too costly, so Weta Digital instead warped each shot based on facial reference from Reynolds, and adjusted the lighting to reflect the changes. This was called an [...] "ingenious 2D-ish solution".|$|E

40|$|Role of microalloying {{elements}} in the microstructure of <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>steels</b> A comparative study {{of some of the}} most important effects of the diverse {{microalloying elements}} on austenite and ferrite microstructure of <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> microalloyed <b>steels</b> is carried out. The values of different aspects such as pinning and driving forces, size of precipitates, activation energies or diffusion coefficients are discussed. Titanium is the most effective element to control grain growth at high reheating temperatures and a weight Ti/N ratio close to 2 is recommended. Aluminum can help to control grain growth at medium temperatures, but its addition to Ti steels can promote abnormal grain growth. Niobium is the most effective element to inhibit static recrystallization of austenite, due to the adequate precipitation temperature range at deformation temperatures and the strong pinning effect of Nb carbonitrides. Finally, the preferential nucleation of intragranular ferrite on particles such as vanadium carbonitrides enhances the ferrite grain refinement...|$|R

The {{inhibitive}} {{action of}} extract from mint leaves (EML) on Q 235 A <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> carbon <b>steel</b> (HRCS) in 0. 5 mol/L H 2 SO 4 solution was studied using weight loss measurement, electrochemical polarization and {{scanning electron microscope}} (SEM) characterization.

40|$|M. Ing. Grade 350 W {{structural}} steel was {{introduced into the}} South African steel market to replace its predecessor 300 W {{structural steel}}. 350 W structural steel has a 50 MPa increase in its minimum yield strength. Currently, little or no experimental data exists that describes the behaviour of full scale 350 W structural sections. No extensive comparisons between 350 W and 300 W, as to their structural behaviour, exist. The main aim {{of this investigation was}} firstly to determine if the minimum yield strength was fully realised throughout typical sections and if the increase in yield strength changed the yielding behaviour of the material. Secondly, the effect that the increased yield strength has on the structural resistance of axial compression members. The investigation largely consisted of an evaluation of firstly the material and then secondly the structural behaviour of full scale member sections as axial members. It was found that all the sections tested complied with the minimum specified yield strength of 350 MPa. In general, 350 W <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> structural <b>steel</b> yields more gradually than 300 W <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> structural <b>steel.</b> This increase is small and seems to be of little significance as far as the overall behaviour is concerned. In general, the increase in minimum yield strength from 300 MPa to 350 MPa has realised an increase in critical buckling strength well into the medium slenderness ratio region and is beneficial for members of short and intermediate lengths. The data seems to indicate that SANS 10162 - 1 : 2005 can be used with confidence when designing axial compression members in 350 W <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> structural <b>steel...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of intercritical rolling on the microstructural development during {{the processing of}} <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> multiphase <b>steels</b> is characterised. Intercritical rolling leads to dynamic recovery of ferrite and to strain-induced transformation of austenite into ferrite. The prior deformation of austenite considerably influences the bainite transformation. It is shown that a smaller amount of austenite transforms into bainite when bainite forms from deformed austenite. This is explained by the physics of the bainite transformation...|$|R

50|$|The SCS process imparts {{a measure}} of rust {{resistance}} to the sheet steel, so that when exposed to a noncondensing atmosphere, its propensity to rust is markedly {{less than that of}} <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> that is not treated with the SCS process. The exact metallurgical phenomenon underlying this transformation of the surface to make it more rust resistant is not fully understood; however, it is theorized that the remaining wustite layer (chemical symbol FeO) contains a much lower proportion of oxygen than the removed hematite and magnetite layers and is, therefore, more stable and less prone to oxidation when exposed to a noncondensing atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|The type of {{guideway}} used on {{a system}} varies between networks. Two parallel roll ways, each {{the width of a}} tyre, are used, either of concrete (Montreal Metro, Lille Metro, Toulouse Metro, most parts of Santiago Metro), concrete slab (Busan Subway Line 4), H-Shape <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>steel</b> (Paris M√©tro, Mexico City Metro, the non-underground section of Santiago Metro), or flat steel (Sapporo Municipal Subway). As on a railway, the driver does not have to steer, because the system relies on a redundant system of railway steel wheels with flanges on steel rail tracks. The Sapporo system is an exception as it uses a central guide rail only. The VAL system used in Lille and Toulouse has conventional track between the guide bars.|$|E
40|$|Abstract‚ÄîIn this paper, {{an immune}} {{inspired}} multi-objective fuzzy modeling (IMOFM) mechanism is proposed specifically for high-dimensional regression problems. For such problems, high predictive accuracy {{is often the}} paramount requirement. With such a requirement in mind, however, one should also put considerable efforts in making the elicited model as interpretable as possible, {{which leads to a}} difficult optimization problem. The proposed modeling approach adopts a multi-stage modeling procedure and a variable length coding scheme to account for the enlarged search space due to the simultaneous optimization of the rule-base structure and its associated parameters. IMOFM can account for both Singleton and Mamdani Fuzzy Rule-Based Systems (FRBS) due to the carefully chosen output membership functions, the inference and the defuzzification methods. The proposed algorithm has been compared with other representatives using a simple benchmark problem, and has also been applied to a high-dimensional problem which models mechanical properties of <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> <b>steels.</b> Results confirm that IMOFM can elicit accurate and yet transparent FRBSs from quantitative data...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} further reveal the {{microstructural}} characterization and formation mechanism of abnormal segregation band of <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> ferrite/pearlite <b>steel,</b> the microstructure {{of this type}} steel was intensively studied with Scanning Auger Microprobe (SAM), etc. The results show that severe C‚ÄìMn segregation exists in the abnormal segregation band region {{at the center of}} <b>hot</b> <b>rolled</b> ferrite/pearlite <b>steel,</b> which results from the Mn segregation during solidification process of the continuous casting slab. The C‚ÄìMn segregation causes relative displacement of pearlite transformation curve and bainite transformation curve of C curve in the corresponding region, leading to bay-like shaped C curve. The bay-like shaped C curve creates conditions for the transformation from supercooling austenite to bainite at relatively lower cooling rate in this region. The Fe‚ÄìMn‚ÄìC Atomic Segregation Zone (FASZ) caused by C‚ÄìMn segregation can powerfully retard the atomic motion, and increase the lattice reconstruction resistance of austenite transformation. These two factors provide thermodynamic and kinetic conditions for the bainite transformation, and result in the emergence of granular bainitic abnormal segregation band at the center of steel plate, which leads to lower plasticity and toughness of this region, and induces the layered fracture...|$|R
