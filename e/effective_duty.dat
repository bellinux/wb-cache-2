The transformer leakage inductance {{is used in}} the ZCS-purposed resonant process, eliminating thus the need for an additional resonant inductor.

40|$|Break-throughs in {{the study}} of {{superfluid}} He- 3 weak links and recent demonstration of Josephson effect in He- 4 are a result of significant advances in ultra-sensitive transducer and nanofabrication technology.

In existing devices, the DC Josephson effect is driven by chemical potential difference produced by a pressure applied across the weak link.

This paper proposes a new three-phase voltage fed DC-DC converter, which is suitable for high-voltage, high-current applications. The transformer turn ratio is reduced to half owing to Δ-Y connection. The zero-voltage and zero-current switches (ZVZCS) for all switches are achieved over wide load range without affecting <b>effective</b> <b>duty</b> cycle. A clamp circuit not only clamps the surge voltage but also reduces the circulation current flowing in the high-current side, resulting in significantly reduced conduction losses.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the complete theoretical analysis, simulation and design optimisation of a Full-Bridge ZeroVoltage -Switched Phase-Shift (FB-ZVS-PS) DC-DC converter with an LCC auxiliary circuit, {{working with a}} frequency of 250 kHz and with an output power of 1 kW. The converter uses a voltage capacitor divider to create half of the input voltage in one terminal of the auxiliary inductor. The voltage at the inductor terminals will, therefore, oscillate between [...] V I / 2 and +V I / 2, producing an additional current reinforcing the primary current during the passive-to-active transition and increasing the energy available to achieve ZVS. This way, {{it is possible to}} design FB-PS-ZVS DC/DC converter without using a commutating inductor in series with the power transformer, avoiding the problems related with the <b>effective</b> <b>duty</b> cycle reduction.

40|$|Molecular motors {{are found}} {{throughout}} {{the cells of the}} human body, and have many different and important roles. These micro-machines move along filament tracks, and have the ability to convert chemical energy into mechanical work that powers cellular motility. Different types of motors are characterized by different duty-ratios, which is the fraction of time that a motor is attached to its filament. In the case of myosin II - a non-processive molecular machine with a low duty ratio - cooperativity between several motors is essential to induce motion along its actin filament track. In this work we use statistical mechanical tools to calculate the duty ratio of cooperative molecular motors. The model suggests that the <b>effective</b> <b>duty</b> ratio of non-processive motors that work in cooperation is lower than the duty ratio of the individual motors. The origin of this effect is the elastic tension that develops in the filament which is relieved when motors detach from the track. Comment: Accepted for publication in PR...|$|E

The features of each mechanism have been thoroughly and quantitatively explored and optimized for certain kinds of applications, but a comparison of some key parameters, especially in the aspect of the repetition rate, is required. In this paper, we will first review the theoretical models and existing performance of these two mechanisms and, consequently, compare them quantitatively in different aspects: the focal group delay dispersion, the pupil size, the <b>effective</b> <b>duty</b> ratio, and the temporal numerical aperture. All these fundamental parameters are related to the repetition rate.

The central trapping electrode accumulation cell increases sensitivity by providing the necessary potential well in a confined volume to capture ions currently lost during the detection event of LC/FTICR experiments. With this electrode geometry the time needed to gate the ions into the analyzer cell is reduced and pump down delays are minimized. The decreased scan time improves LC resolution and increases the number of mass spectral scans per eluted component while maintaining appropriate base pressures for high performance ESI/FTICR.

Much past work has examined microarchitectural policies for reducing total chip power, but these techniques alone are insufficient if not aimed at mitigating individual hotspots. The industry’s current trend has been toward multicore architectures, which provide additional opportunities for dynamic thermal management. This paper explores various thermal management techniques that exploit the distributed nature of multicore processors. We classify these techniques in terms of core throttling policy, whether that policy is applied locally to a core or to the processor as a whole, and process migration policies. We use Turandot and a HotSpot-based thermal simulator to simulate a variety of workloads under thermal duress on a 4 -core PowerPC TM processor.
