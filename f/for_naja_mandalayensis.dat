50|$|The Mandalay {{spitting}} cobra (<b>Naja</b> <b>mandalayensis),</b> {{also called}} the Burmese spitting cobra or Mandalay cobra, is a species of spitting cobra endemic to the dry zone in central Myanmar.|$|R
50|$|Although {{this is not}} a {{spitting}} cobra, {{some individuals}} (mostly specimens from Guizhou Province) are capable of ejecting venom towards a threat within a distance of 2 m. In Taiwan there were 593 recorded cases of envenomation by the Chinese cobra from 1904-1938, of those 87 cases were fatal which is a 15% mortality rate.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the allelopathic activity of two submersed macrophytes with different growth forms and nutri-ent uptake modes, Ceratophyllum demersum and Najas marina ssp. intermedia. A bioassay-directed method development revealed optimal extraction solvents for allelochemicals from both macrophytes. <b>For</b> <b>Najas,</b> 50 % methanol and for Ceratophyllum 50 % acetone yielded the strongest inhibition in the agar-diffusion assay with various filamentous or chroococcal cyanobacteria as target species. Further fractionation by liquid–liquid extraction (LLE) and solid phase extraction (SPE) procedures showed that both aquatic plants {{appear to have}} more than one active fraction, one being hydrophilic and one moderately lipophilic. The water-soluble allelochemicals may inhibit phytoplankton whereas the lipophilic allelochemicals may act through direct cell–cell contact, e. g., against epiphytes.

40|$|The {{protective}} {{activity of}} some antivenoms on the neuromuscular activity in vitro of six snake venoms {{was established in}} order to test the feasibility of using a simple isolated nerve-muscle preparation to compare different antivenoms. Six venoms designated as International Reference Venoms by the World Health Organization (WHO) were used: Echis carinatus (Iran), Echis carinatus (Mali), Naja naja kaouthia, Notechis scutatus, Trimeresurus flavoviridis, and Vipera russelli (Thailand). The chick biventer cervicis nerve-muscle preparation was used to detect neurotoxic and myotoxic effects. The ratio of the amount of antivenom needed to neutralize a dose of venom (w/w) was calculated in order to quantify the potencies of the antivenoms. The antivenom to venom ratios were 1000 for Echis carinatus (Mali) and for Notechis scutatus; 100 <b>for</b> <b>Naja</b> naja kaouthia and Vipera russelli; and 10 for Echis carinatus (Iran) and Trimeresurus falvoviridis.

40|$|Environmental niche {{conservatism}} {{defines a}} concept, stating that species {{could live in}} the same environmental condition in both native and invasive ranges. Niche modeling often used this as basis for the prediction of the range of invasive plants. However, it is debatable whether environmental niches of invasive plant species are conserved or shift between native and invasive ranges. Only few studies have investigated such a shift in aquatic plant invaders (APIs) on a meaningful global scale. Environmental niche modeling was used to project climatic niche distributions of 10 APIs based both on the native range and the invasive range of species. We found that niche shifts of APIs between native and invasive ranges may occur throughout the world. Moreover, we found niche shifts of APIs between native and invasive ranges across different biomes. The largest climatic niche shift was detected <b>for</b> <b>Najas</b> minor and the smallest for Alternanthera philoxeroides. For all 10 APIs, overlap between both ranges was maximal for large river deltas, while overlap was minimal for temperate floodplain rivers and wetlands. For APIs, the suitability of the climatic habitat was highest in temperate coastal rivers for invasive models in invasive ranges. More importantly, based on invasive models, climatic suitability was significantly higher for temperate coastal rivers and temperate floodplain rivers and wetlands in invasive ranges and compared to native models. We suggest to integrate climatic niches of both native and invasive ranges into projections of the global climatic niche distribution of APIs...|$|R

5000|$|Many factors {{influence}} {{the differences in}} cases of fatality among different species within the same genus. Among cobras, the cases of fatal outcome of bites in both treated and untreated victims can be quite large. For example, mortality rates among untreated cases of envenomation by the cobras as a whole group ranges from 6.5-10% for N kaouthia. [...] to about 70% for N. oxiana. Mortality rate <b>for</b> <b>Naja</b> atra is between 15 and 20%, 5-10% for N. nigricollis, 50% for N. nivea, 65-70% for N. melanoleuca, 20-25% <b>for</b> N. <b>naja,</b> and 50-60% <b>for</b> N. samarensis. In cases where victims of cobra bites are medically treated using normal treatment protocol for elapid type envenomation, differences in prognosis depend on the cobra species involved. The vast majority of envenomated patients treated make quick and complete recoveries, while other envenomated patients who receive similar treatment result in fatalities. The most important factors in the difference of mortality rates among victims envenomated by cobras is {{the severity of the}} bite and which cobra species caused the envenomation. The Caspian cobra (N. oxiana) and the Philippine cobra (N. philippinensis) are the two cobra species with the most toxic venoms based on [...] studies on mice. Both species cause prominent neurotoxicity and progression of life-threatening symptoms following envenomation. Death has been reported in as little as 30 minutes in cases of envenomation by both species. N. philippinensiss purely neurotoxic venom causes prominent neurotoxicity with minimal local tissue damage and pain and patients respond very well to antivenom therapy if treatment is administered rapidly after envenomation. Envenomation caused by N. oxiana is much more complicated. In addition to prominent neurotoxicity, very potent cytotoxic and cardiotoxic components are in this species venom. Local effects are marked and manifest in all cases of envenomation - severe pain, severe swelling, bruising, blistering, and tissue necrosis. Renal damage and cardiotoxicity are also clinical manifestations of envenomation caused by N. oxiana, though they are rare and secondary. The untreated mortality rate among those envenomed by N. oxiana approaches 80%, the highest among all species within the genus Naja. Antivenom is not as effective for envenomation by this species as it is for other Asiatic cobras within the same region, like the Indian cobra (N. naja) and due to the dangerous toxicity of this species venom, massive amounts of antivenom are often required for patients. As a result, a monovalent antivenom serum is being developed by the Razi Vaccine and Serum Research Institute in Iran. Response to treatment with antivenom is generally poor among patients, so mechanical ventilation and endotracheal intubation is required. As a result, mortality among those treated for N. oxiana envenomation is still relatively high (up to 30%) compared to all other species of cobra (<1%).|$|R

40|$|International audienceAn impedimetric {{biosensor}} {{to determine}} the activity of phospholipase A 2 has been developed for the first time. This biosensor {{is based on the}} immobilization of the enzyme phospholipase A 2 (PLA 2) from snake venom on the surface of a gold electrode. The enzymatic reaction takes place {{in the presence of the}} L-α -phosphatidylcholine (lecithin) substrate, in 10 mM pH 7. 4 phosphate buffer. The impedance of the enzymatically modified electrode/ electrolyte interface increased as the concentration of lecithin increases. A detection limit of 10 − 11 M and a linear range of 10 − 10 M to 10 − 5 M were obtained. At a fixed concentration of lecithin (10 − 3 mM), when the PLA 2 enzyme with a certain level of activity is injected, the impedance of the enzymatically modified electrode/ electrolyte interface changed in the inverse direction, due to the competitive effect of the injected PLA 2 enzyme. A linear range of 10 to 400 ng/L (corresponding to 16 to 640 U/L) was obtained <b>for</b> commercial <b>naja</b> mossambica mossambica snake venom.

40|$|BACKGROUND: In West Africa, envenoming by saw-scaled or carpet vipers (Echis ocellatus) causes great {{morbidity}} and mortality, {{but there is}} a crisis in supply of effective and affordable antivenom (ISRCTN 01257358). METHODS: In a randomised, double-blind, controlled, non-inferiority trial, "EchiTAb Plus-ICP" (ET-Plus) equine antivenom made by Instituto Clodomiro Picado was compared to "EchiTAb G" (ET-G) ovine antivenom made by MicroPharm, which is the standard of care in Nigeria and was developed from the original EchiTAb-Fab introduced in 1998. Both are caprylic acid purified whole IgG antivenoms. ET-G is monospecific for Echis ocellatus antivenom (initial dose 1 vial) and ET-Plus is polyspecific <b>for</b> E. ocellatus, <b>Naja</b> nigricollis and Bitis arietans (initial dose 3 vials). Both had been screened by pre-clinical and preliminary clinical dose-finding and safety studies. Patients who presented with incoagulable blood, indicative of systemic envenoming by E. ocellatus, were recruited in Kaltungo, north-eastern Nigeria. Those eligible and consenting were randomly allocated with equal probability to receive ET-Plus or ET-G. The primary outcome was permanent restoration of blood coagulability 6 hours after the start of treatment, assessed by a simple whole blood clotting test repeated 6, 12, 18, 24 and 48 hr after treatment. Secondary (safety) outcomes were the incidences of anaphylactic, pyrogenic and late serum sickness-type antivenom reactions. FINDINGS: Initial doses permanently restored blood coagulability at 6 hours in 161 / 194 (83. 0 %) of ET-Plus and 156 / 206 (75. 7 %) of ET-G treated patients (Relative Risk [RR] 1. 10 one-sided 95 % CI lower limit 1. 01; P = 0. 05). ET-Plus caused early reactions on more occasions than did ET-G [50 / 194 (25. 8 %) and 39 / 206 (18. 9 %) respectively RR (1. 36 one-sided 95 % CI 1. 86 upper limit; P = 0. 06). These reactions were classified as severe in 21 (10. 8 %) and 11 (5. 3 %) of patients, respectively. CONCLUSION: At these doses, ET-Plus was slightly more effective but ET-G was slightly safer.
