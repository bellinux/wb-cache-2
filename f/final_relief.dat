25|$|Green {{began the}} 2012 Nationwide Series {{schedule}} year driving {{the year in}} the new No. 10 for TriStar, but after an injury to Eric McClure after the 2012 Talladega race, Green was named interim driver of the No. 14. Green finished 19th in his first relief start at Darlington, but finished 32nd at Iowa and Lowe's due to a crash and an engine failure respectively. In his fourth relief start, Green posted his best finish of the year, 17th, at Dover International Speedway In his <b>final</b> <b>relief</b> start, Green finished on the lead lap in 18th at Michigan International Speedway. He has since returned to the No. 10.|$|E
25|$|He {{entered the}} Royal Navy as a {{midshipman}} in 1779. He {{served in the}} West Indies from 1779 to 1783, seeing action in the Caribbean during the American Revolutionary War and in Lord Howe's <b>final</b> <b>relief</b> of the French and Spanish siege of Gibraltar in 1782. From 1783 to 1793, {{he served in the}} East Indies. Promoted to commander, he defeated a French division off Puerto Rico on 5 June 1795, and, in 1796, he participated in the capture of the Dutch colonies of Demerara, Essequibo and Berbice, becoming the British governor of Netherlands Guiana. He continued to fight against the French in Santo Domingo, from 1797 to 1799, losing his ship HMS Pique but capturing the French frigate Seine at the Action of 30 June 1798 and, in 1800, he captured the French frigate La Vengeance off the coast of Africa.|$|E
25|$|Malcolm was {{commissioned}} {{in what would}} later {{become known as the}} Royal Marines in 1779 at the age of twelve. During the American Revolutionary War he was assigned to the Channel Fleet. In October, 1782, the fifteen-year-old Marine Lieutenant participated in Howe's <b>final</b> <b>relief</b> of the British forces in the Great Siege of Gibraltar, and the subsequent Battle of Cape Spartel, under the orders of Admiral Lord Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe. Royal Marine Captain James Malcolm fought at sea under the command of Vice Admiral Sir John Duckworth, 1st Baronet in the Battle of San Domingo. In the course of the fighting, in which Royal Marines played an important role, all of the enemy's ships of the line were either captured or destroyed. For his valour in that action, Captain Malcolm was brevetted a Major on the Army List with seniority in that grade dating 6 February 1806.|$|E

50|$|The {{designs were}} overseen by master {{craftsmen}} {{who must have}} had access the prints and woodcuts of contemporary works of art, and seem especially influenced by diptych and triptych panel paintings. The tools and equipment used {{were similar to those}} used in the production of larger altarpieces, and would have included rip and crosscut saws, planes and card scrapers (to smooth out the markings left by the saws), chisels, augers, braces and gimlets. The wood was at first cut into the required dimensions as blocks, after which the joins were carved out. The next step was to establish the surface plane onto which the <b>final</b> <b>reliefs</b> would be added. These would have been created from multiple separate wood pieces or gossamer sheets, individually produced before being overlaid onto one another and joined in layers.|$|R
25|$|The {{earliest}} Campana reliefs {{were made}} {{in the middle of the}} first century BC, during the final period of the Roman Republic, and they were most common in the first quarter of the first century AD. At this time, the reliefs experienced not only their greatest extent but also their greatest variety of motifs. The <b>final</b> <b>reliefs</b> derive from about two hundred years later - production and use stopped in the time of Hadrian. While this general dating is largely viewed as secure, the exact date of the individual pieces can rarely be given. A relative chronology might be determined on the basis of comparison of motifs and styles. Iconographic research is unhelpful for this purpose because the motifs derive from a traditional repertoire, which was used largely without variation over a long period of time. Motifs from daily life are more helpful, however, since some of them depict datable building work such as the Capitoline Temple, which was built in AD 82 and is depicted on a relief from the Louvre Museum, providing a terminus ante quem for that tile.|$|R
500|$|In the <b>final</b> <b>relief</b> {{appearance}} of Ramírez's first stint {{with the major}} league club, he faced the Tampa Bay Devil Rays on July 20. Without an appearance since July 6 in Anaheim, he was pitching on two weeks of rest. Without control of his pitches, Ramírez walked four batters and allowed a grand slam to Dioner Navarro without recording an out. Only two of his 19 pitches were called strikes. [...] After the game, Ramírez, shaken by his performance, cut short his comments to reporters, and was seen crying at his locker. The Yankees optioned Ramírez back to Scranton/Wilkes-Barre the following day. In his first appearance with Scranton/Wilkes Barre following his demotion, Ramírez continued pitching effectively, striking out two in [...] hitless innings, helping Joba Chamberlain hold onto his first career Class AAA victory.|$|E
500|$|During {{the next}} few seasons, Richard split time between the minors and majors and did not become a regular starter with the Astros until 1975. After his [...] "cup of coffee" [...] with the Astros in 1971, Richard was sent back down to Class-AAA {{baseball}} {{to work on his}} pitching with the Oklahoma City 89ers for the 1972 season. He started 19games with the 89ers before being called back up to the Astros. In Triple-A baseball in the American Association, Richard finished with 10wins and eightlosses in 128innings of work. His 3.02ERA was slightly higher than that of the previous season, but he maintained approximately the same walks per nine innings ratio (BB/9IP) that he had the previous year. He recorded six complete games and finished with 169strikeouts, for a ratio of 11.88strikeouts per 9innings. Richard re-entered the majors, starting a day game of a day-night doubleheader for the Astros against the San Diego Padres on July 30, 1972. He struggled and took the 10–7 loss. Richard did not pitch again until two weeks later, when he entered in relief for Ken Forsch in the fifth inning to keep the Giants limited to a one-run lead. In two innings of relief, Richard gave up one hit, struck out three batters and garnered the win. In his two <b>final</b> <b>relief</b> appearances of the season, Richard gave up five earned runs in just over one inning of work. He finished the season with a 13.50ERA in only six innings of work and was again sent back down to Triple-A, this time with the Astros-affiliated Denver Bears.|$|E
2500|$|On each {{face of the}} {{pedestal}} is a bas-relief depicting {{a scene from the}} passion. The first on {{the pedestal}}'s south side shows Jesus praying in the Garden of Olives/Gethsemane as three of his apostles sleep ("Agonie du Christ"). The bas-relief {{at the rear of the}} calvary, the eastern side, shows the flagellation. Jesus is surrounded by two soldiers holding whips. The third relief on the west side depicts Christ's resurrection and in the <b>final</b> <b>relief</b> on the north side Jesus sits between two Roman soldiers who are kneeling and mocking him, one handing him a reed and joking that he should hold it as his sceptre; the [...] "Christ aux outrages" [...] or [...] "Dėrision du Christ". It is not thought that the bas-reliefs are by either Guillouic or Jacquot but that they are the work of two different 16th Century sculptors.|$|E

2500|$|Phipps {{was then}} given {{command of the}} newly {{captured}} 36-gun [...] in July 1780. Monsieur completed fitting out at Portsmouth in October 1780, and Phipps soon scored his first success with her, capturing the 20-gun Chevreuil on 15 December. He next commanded her at the relief of Gibraltar in 1781 with George Darby's fleet, and on 10 October that year assisted [...] in capturing the French 22-gun ship Jason off Cape Clear. His final command was the 74-gun , which he took over in March 1782. Berwick served as part of Lord Howe's fleet for the third and <b>final</b> <b>relief</b> of Gibraltar in late 1782, and was in action at the Battle of Cape Spartel on 20 October 1782. She then sailed to the West Indies with Sir Richard Hughes's fleet, and arrived there in December. Berwick was paid off in June 1783, {{after the end of}} the American War of Independence, and Phipps went ashore, apparently having no further seagoing commands.|$|E

6000|$|It was {{as such a}} one, therefore, that, {{for three}} or four days more, Milly watched Kate as just such another; and it was {{presently}} as such a one that she threw herself into their promised visit, at last achieved, to Chelsea, the quarter of the famous Carlyle, the field of exercise of his ghost, his votaries, and the residence of [...] "poor Marian," [...] so often referred to and actually a somewhat incongruous spirit there. With our young woman's first view of poor Marian everything gave way but the sense of how, in England, apparently, the social situation of sisters could be opposed, how common ground, for a place in the world, could quite fail them: a state of things sagely perceived to be involved in an hierarchical, an aristocratic order. Just whereabouts in the order Mrs. Lowder had established her niece was a question not wholly void, as yet, no doubt, of ambiguity--though Milly was withal sure Lord Mark could exactly have fixed the point if he would, fixing {{it at the same time}} for Aunt Maud herself; but it was clear that Mrs. Condrip was, as might have been said, in quite another geography. She would not, in short, have been to be found on the same social map, and it was as if her visitors had turned over page after page together before the <b>final</b> <b>relief</b> of their benevolent [...] "Here!" [...] The interval was bridged, of course, but the bridge, verily, was needed, and the impression left Milly to wonder whether, in the general connection, it were of bridges or of intervals that the spirit not locally disciplined would find itself most conscious. It was as if at home, by contrast, there were neither--neither the difference itself, from position to position, nor, on either side, and particularly on one, the awfully good manner, the conscious sinking of a consciousness, that made up for it. The conscious sinking, at all events, and the awfully good manner, the difference, the bridge, the interval, the skipped leaves of the social atlas--these, it was to be confessed, had a little, for our young lady, in default of stouter stuff, to work themselves into the light literary legend--a mixed, wandering echo of Trollope, of Thackeray, perhaps mostly of Dickens--under favour of which her pilgrimage had so much appealed. She could relate to Susie later on, late the same evening, that the legend, before she had done with it, had run clear, that the adored author of The Newcomes, in fine, had been on the whole the note: the picture lacking thus more than she had hoped, or rather perhaps showing less than she had feared, a certain possibility of Pickwickian outline. She explained how she meant by this that Mrs. Condrip had not altogether proved another Mrs. Nickleby, nor even--for she might have proved almost anything, from the way poor worried Kate had spoken--a widowed and aggravated Mrs. Micawber.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2015 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from Aug. 27, 2014 - Sept. 11, 2015 Relief shading {{is the most common}} type of cartographic relief representation for print and digital maps. Manual relief shading results in informative and visually pleasing representations of terrain, but it is time consuming and expensive to produce. Current analytical relief shading can be created quickly, but the resulting maps are not as aesthetically appealing and do not show landscape features in an explicit manner. This article introduces an automated digital method that produces shaded relief with locally adjusted illumination directions to simulate the techniques and cartographic principles of manual relief shading. Ridgelines and valley lines are derived from a digital terrain model, vectorized, and used in a diffusion curve algorithm. A graph-based network analysis generalizes the lines before using them for diffusion curve shading. The direction of illumination is adjusted based on the spatial orientation of ridgelines and valley lines. The diffusion curve shading is combined with standard analytical relief shading to create a <b>final</b> shaded <b>relief</b> image. Similar to manual relief shading, major landforms and the structure of the terrain are more clearly shown in the <b>final</b> shaded <b>relief</b> image. The presented method best highlights major landforms in terrain characterized by sharp, clearly defined ridges and valleys...|$|R

He recorded his first NHL shutout on 3 March 2015, over the Buffalo Sabres in a 28-save performance. Vasilevskiy's first playoff win came on 6 June 2015, when he replaced starting goaltender Ben Bishop twice during the third period of Game 2 of the Finals; he thus became the first goalie in 24 years to win a playoff <b>Final</b> in <b>relief</b> {{and the first to}} earn his first career playoff win in <b>relief</b> in the <b>Final</b> since Lester Patrick in 1928.|$|R
