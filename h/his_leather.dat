25|$|A {{ballpoint pen}} is a writing {{instrument}} with an internal ink reservoir and a sphere for a point. The internal chamber {{is filled with}} a viscous ink that is dispensed at its tip during use by the rolling action of a small sphere. The first ballpoint pen {{is the creation of}} American leather tanner John Loud of Weymouth, Massachusetts in 1888 which contained a reservoir for ink and a roller ball to mark up <b>his</b> <b>leather</b> hides. Despite Loud being the inventor of the ballpoint pen, it wasn't a practical success since the ink often leaked or clogged up. Loud took out a patent (British patent #15630) in the United Kingdom on October 30, 1888. However, it wasn't until 1935 when Hungarian newspaper editor László Bíró offered an improved version of the ballpoint pen that left paper smudge-free.|$|E
25|$|In 1817 Jesse, and a John F. Wells, {{were offered}} {{work in a}} large tannery in Ravenna, now owned and managed by Mrs. Mary Mason, the widow of Jared Mason. She later married Wells and sold the tannery to Jesse who became the sole owner. Jesse sold and shipped much of <b>his</b> <b>leather</b> to a {{merchant}} in Point Pleasant, which would become his future home in 1820. During this time Jesse took up lodging at an inn {{across the street from}} the tannery. Within two years he managed to save some $1500. Jesse's father Noah Grant died in Maysville, Kentucky, on February 14, 1819. That year, at age 25, Jesse became ill and was sent to Kentucky to recover from malaria, while his affliction sickness lasted more than a year. Unable to work and with creditors pressing he lost most of his savings. In 1820, when he was partially recovered and able to travel short distances, he moved to Maysville and lived with relatives for several weeks. After recovering he returned to Ohio and the tannery business.|$|E

Bär evaded Soviet patrols which rushed to the crash site. Bär remained in hiding through to the following night. He turned <b>his</b> <b>leather</b> jacket inside-out and discarded his flying boots to present himself as a Russian peasant. Vanity prevented him from throwing away the Knight's Cross and Oak Leaves and he hid the items. Bär eventually made it to German lines but aggravated his injuries and spent two months in hospital.|$|E
500|$|The winning entry was by Angel Gracia and Cliff Guest and {{it showed}} the female protagonist (played by the director's sister Anabel Garcia) being {{supported}} and guided by her girlfriends who introduce her with the male protagonist. The girl even goes to the boy's door to gift him flowers, thereby reversing the usual gender-directed pattern of gift-giving. The male protagonist is portrayed as a [...] "perfect boy" [...] (played by William Fitzgibbon) having the sensibilities like attentiveness, cuteness, playfulness like a friend (after the lyrics [...] "You're my best friend") and not sexual overtones. The video in-turn contrasts him with a self-centered boy who puts on sunglasses, throws <b>his</b> <b>leather</b> jacket {{over his shoulder and}} walks away from the girl. Other videos portrayed a girl pining for her sailor, US-Soviet relations and an arguing couple with the girl in a scene inspired by the music video of Tina Turner's 1984 single [...] "What's Love Got to Do with It".|$|E
500|$|On 20July 1917, {{soon after}} {{arriving}} {{at his new}} unit in France, Pentland achieved his first victory in the SPAD when he shared {{in the destruction of}} an Albatros two-seater.

Four days later, after stopping an enemy truck convoy in its tracks by crippling its lead vehicle with machine-gun fire, he reportedly engaged ten Albatros fighters single-handedly; {{by the time he had}} driven them off, four bullets had penetrated <b>his</b> <b>leather</b> flying suit without injuring him, while his plane had absorbed so much punishment that it had to be scrapped when he got back to base. After sharing another Albatros two-seater on 20August, Pentland led a raid on Marcke aerodrome, home of Baron von Richthofen's Jasta11, on 26August. On the way, he helped bring down a DFWC.V, then achieved complete surprise at the airfield, which he and his flight proceeded to shoot up. On the return journey, he strafed an enemy train until his guns jammed and then, having managed to clear them, engaged two more German scouts.

500|$|After {{three years}} of study with Berghof and Uta Hagen at the HB Studio, Charles Grodin told Wilder about Lee Strasberg's method acting. Grodin persuaded {{him to leave the}} studio and begin {{studying}} with Strasberg in his private class. Several months later, Wilder was accepted into the Actors Studio. Feeling that [...] "Jerry Silberman in Macbeth" [...] did not have the right ring to it, he adopted a stage name. He chose [...] "Wilder" [...] because it reminded him of Our Town author Thornton Wilder, while [...] "Gene" [...] came from Thomas Wolfe's first novel, Look Homeward, Angel. He also liked [...] "Gene" [...] because as a boy, he was impressed by a distant relative, a World War II bomber navigator who was [...] "handsome and looked great in <b>his</b> <b>leather</b> flight jacket." [...] He later said that he could not see Gene Wilder playing Macbeth, either. After joining the Actors Studio, he slowly began to be noticed in the off-Broadway scene, thanks to performances in Sir Arnold Wesker's Roots and in Graham Greene's The Complaisant Lover, for which Wilder received the Clarence Derwent Award for [...] "Best Performance by an Actor in a Nonfeatured Role." [...] One of Wilder's early stage credits was playing the socially awkward mental patient Billy Bibbit in the original 1963-64 Broadway adaptation of Ken Kesey's novel One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest opposite star Kirk Douglas.|$|E

2500|$|By 1945, Creţu argues, Negoiţescu {{had reached}} his {{creative}} maturity, primarily by perfecting the [...] "deconstruction" [...] of texts making {{the object of}} his reviews. In particular, Creţu sees as outstanding the young critic's verdicts on George Călinescu's novel Enigma Otiliei (where Negoiţescu had identified, probably ahead of all other commentators, a level of parody running underneath the formal borrowings from Honoré de Balzac) and on the poems of George Bacovia (compared by Negoiţescu to the overall artistic standards of the local Symbolist circles, with which Bacovia had been formally affiliated). Written in parallel, Povestea tristă a lui Ramon Ocg, described by Ştefănescu as marking Negoiţescu's brief affiliation with Surrealism, romanticizes the life of Mexican film star Ramón Novarro, with emphasis on Navarro's homosexuality. In Bogdan Creţu's definition, the book shows Negoiţescu's commitment to anti-fascism, and especially his use of satire against [...] "the fascist ideology, with all its abuses." [...] Creţu also notes that the printing of Povestea tristă... was financed with money Negoiţescu had made by selling <b>his</b> <b>leather</b> boots, part of a Guardist's paramilitary attire.|$|E

5000|$|When Knievel {{switched}} to the Laverda motorcycle in 1969, he switched <b>his</b> <b>leathers</b> to a white jumpsuit with Confederate stars on blue stripes.

Following the Confederate stars, Knievel adjusted the blue stripes to a V-shape (the first version of the V-shape was also used in the 1971 film's final jump). For the remainder of his career, variants of the V-shaped white-starred jumpsuit would be a constant, including a special nylon/canvas flightsuit that matched <b>his</b> white <b>leathers</b> for the X-2 jump. Each variant would become more elaborate, including the addition of the red-white-blue cape and the Elvis-styled belt-buckle with his initials [...] "EK". In 1975, Knievel premiered the blue leathers with red stars on the white stripes for the Wembley jump. [...] Both the blue leathers and white leathers were featured in Viva Knievel!.|$|R

2500|$|Albarn was {{interested}} in music from an early age, attending an Osmonds concert {{at the age of}} six. He started playing guitar, piano and violin in his youth and {{was interested}} in composing music, one of his compositions winning a heat in the nationwide Young Composer of the Year competition. Damon and Jessica both attended a primary school nearby which, according to Damon, was burnt down seven times over a period of 18 months by one of the teachers. After both siblings failed their eleven-plus exams, they started attending Stanway Comprehensive School, where Damon described himself as being [...] "really unpopular" [...] and [...] " [...] a lot of people". However, he developed an interest in drama and started acting in various school productions. It was at Stanway where he would meet future Blur guitarist Graham Coxon, who recalls seeing him act and feeling that he was a [...] "confident performer" [...] as well as a [...] "show off". Albarn's first words directed at Coxon were [...] "Your brogues are crap, mate. Look, mine are the proper sort" [...] as he was showing off <b>his</b> <b>leather</b> shoes, fashionable footwear at the time influenced by the Mod Revival. Nevertheless, the pair went on to become good friends, due to their shared passion for music, particularly bands such as The Jam, The Beatles, The Human League, XTC and Madness.|$|E
2500|$|Finch {{was coming}} {{to the end of}} a course of the {{antidepressant}} drug Effexor on a reduced dose when he ended his own life unseen on a rainy Saturday afternoon. He left <b>his</b> <b>leather</b> briefcase against the pedestrian walkway railing mid-span of the Golden Gate Bridge. His office desk contained several suicide notes but his death was not confirmed until his body was found nearly six weeks later, seven miles out to sea, near Pillar Point Harbor, about 25 miles south of the bridge from which he jumped. The coroner described his body as [...] "intact but unrecognisable". Many of his friends and colleagues were deeply shocked by his death but his close friends were not surprised by his cinematic ending. His eulogist, Jenni Olson, summed it up: [...] "Of course, given his personality, I just thought, 'Oh, how Mark' that it would be so spectacular. He doesn't do anything in a small way." [...] A memorial service was held at the Castro Theatre on 26 February 1995, and the 19th San Francisco Festival was dedicated to Finch's memory. A special fund was established in his name [...] "to help support the work of emerging queer filmmakers". Ten years after his death Olson made a film, The Joy of Life, of which the second half addresses his suicide and the part played in it by the Golden Gate Bridge.|$|E
2500|$|Art {{historian}} Uwe Schneede {{considers this}} performance pivotal for {{the reception of}} German avant garde art in the United States, as it {{paved the way for}} the recognition of Beuys' own work, but also that of contemporaries such as Lüpertz, Baselitz, Kiefer and many others in the 1980s. In May 1974 Beuys flew to New York and was taken by ambulance to the site of the performance, a room in the René Block Gallery at 409 West Broadway. Beuys lay on the ambulance stretcher swathed in felt. He shared this room with a coyote, for eight hours over three days. At times he stood, wrapped in a thick, grey blanket of felt, leaning on a large shepherd's staff. At times he lay on the straw, at times he watched the coyote as the coyote watched him and cautiously circled the man, or shredded the blanket to pieces, and at times he engaged in symbolic gestures, such as striking a large triangle or tossing <b>his</b> <b>leather</b> gloves to the animal; the performance continuously shifted between elements that were required by the realities of the situation, and elements that had a purely symbolic character. At the end of the three days, Beuys hugged the coyote that had grown quite tolerant of him, and was taken to the airport. Again he rode in a veiled ambulance, leaving America without having set foot on its ground. As Beuys later explained: ‘I wanted to isolate myself, insulate myself, see nothing of America other than the coyote.’ ...|$|E
