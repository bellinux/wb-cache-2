25|$|On November 6, the {{formation}} talks became the longest in Belgian history. When the Parliament confirmed {{the formation}} of an interim Government, it had been 196 days since the Belgian people had voted out the previous coalition. It was the second longest <b>formation</b> <b>period</b> in European history, after the Dutch record of 208 days in 1977. Talks were interrupted twice by the resignation of the formateur, which left the political parties waiting for a new appointment by the King. Guy Verhofstadt was appointed as mediator on December 3, with the task not only of looking into {{the formation of}} a new government, but also of investigating how the government could handle certain urgent policy matters. Pressed by time, and some say by the King, on 19 December, Verhofstadt concluded a deal on a Government and presented it to Parliament on 21 December; on the same day the Ministers took the oath of office.|$|E

Past returns and past trading volumes of up to one year were used to form winner and loser portfolios, high volume and low volume portfolios, and portfolios with both extreme returns and extreme volumes. Portfolios were held for periods of up to one year and returns were examined. It was found that winner portfolios out performed loser portfolios and that a zero cost strategy out performed a market portfolio. High volume portfolios outperformed low volume portfolios for <b>formation</b> <b>periods</b> of up to six months. For portfolios based on past volume and past returns winners outperfoemd the market irrespective of volume and losers under performed the market irrespective of volume. Zero cost portfolios conditional on low volume show return momentum emerging for <b>formation</b> <b>periods</b> longer than six months.

40|$|Pair bond {{duration}} and age are suggested {{to be important}} determinants for reproductive success in long-term monogamous pair bonding. These two effects are generally difficult to separate, however, and experimental approaches are scarce. We experimentally examined {{the role of the}} extended pair bond period, controlling for age and experience, in the bearded reedling, Panurus biarmicus. In this species pairs form in juvenile flocks and usually remain stable for life. We experimentally manipulated the pair-formation period in aviary pairs prior to their first breeding season and observed the effect of varying pair bond duration on breeding success, male parental effort and breeding coordination. This was done for pairs with long (6. 5. months), medium (4. months) and short (2. weeks) <b>formation</b> <b>periods.</b> Our results suggest that the length of the bonding period does not influence male parental effort, as males with medium and short <b>formation</b> <b>periods</b> did not reduce their parental effort in nest building, during incubation or in nestling provisioning. Nevertheless, coordination of pair partners (in terms of simultaneous start of nest building) occurred more often when the pair bond period was long, and these pairs also started breeding earlier. Pairs with long bonds succeeded more often in breeding attempts and had higher hatching and fledging success than pairs with medium and short <b>formation</b> <b>periods.</b> Thus, our results support the hypothesis that the duration of the pair bond may improve coordination within a pair before the start of breeding and thereby may result in enhanced reproductive success...|$|R

The contrarian profit is statistically significant for the strategies using short <b>formation</b> and holding <b>periods,</b> especially for the <b>formation</b> <b>periods</b> of 1 to 3 months and the holding periods of 1 to 3 months.
