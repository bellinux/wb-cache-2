Based on an {{engineering}} example of intrusion-clearance of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>wall,</b> the mechanism and effect factors of intrusion-clearance are discussed by monitoring data and numerical analysis. The research result {{shows that the}} deviation of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>wall,</b> bad quality of improved soil and insufficient outward-moving of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>wall</b> cooperatively lead to intrusion-clearance, and the first has a significant effect. Moreover, dewatering of foundation pit also cause deformation of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>wall,</b> which {{accounts for more than}} 25 % of the deformation during excavation, but usually despised in construction. The improving effect of reinforced soil attributes more to the deformation of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>wall,</b> especially the area closed to <b>diaphragm</b> <b>wall.</b> Some remedies and precautions are also given in this article, which could provide references of design and construction for similar projects...|$|R

Considering {{adverse effects}} of shallow gas geology on Hangzhou Metro construction, based on the fluid-solid {{coupling}} analytical method of multi-phase media, effects of shallow gas on <b>diaphragm</b> <b>wall</b> trenching construction were examined by using FLAC- 2 D software.

This project provides an unusual opportunity to study the differential heaves of center columns and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> during excavation.

40|$|The {{subject of}} diploma thesis is a {{geostatic}} {{analysis for the}} protection of a deep construction pit for the facility Zeleni park in Koper. This demanding construction pit was dug in sea sediments. Demanding geotechnical conditions required the use of “top-down” method to protect the construction pit with progressive opening of a reinforced concrete <b>diaphragm</b> <b>wall</b> using basement facility plates. Such construction requires a geotechnical calculation of the construction pit considering excavation phases. The main goal of diploma paper is to evaluate the geotechnical research and to make geostatic analyses for construction pit protection observing different material models for soil in undrained, partially drained and drained conditions, followed by a comparison of results. Diploma paper begins with information about the location and soil structure. Geotechnical researches are resumed and implementation technology in relation to construction pit protection is explained. In continuation, comparative calculations of construction pit protection with the <b>diaphragm</b> <b>wall</b> are presented using two material models for soil with isotropic hardening: the Hardening Soil Model (HS) and the Hardening Soil Model with Small-Strain Stiffness (HSS) which also observes small-strain stiffness of the ground. A calculation of maximum axial forces in bracing plates is made for each model with maximum values of transverse forces, bending moments in <b>diaphragm</b> <b>wall</b> and <b>diaphragm</b> <b>wall</b> shifts. <b>Diaphragm</b> <b>wall</b> was dimensioned for all analyses.

40|$|Deep shafts {{are usually}} {{required}} during tunnels construction (for maintenance tasks when tunnel boring machines –TBM- are used) and/or the operation stage of tunnels (emergency exits). Generally, these shafts are constructed below {{the water table}} and by the cut and cover method. Therefore, impervious <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> are desired for two main reasons: (1) to reduce risks (stability, inflows, flooding, etc.) and outside impacts (loose of groundwater resource, holes and sinkholes, etc.) during the excavation stage of a shaft and, (2) to avoid leaks and inflows of groundwater during the operation stage once the shaft is finished. Given that defects in <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> are frequent and can relatively easy be repaired before starting the excavation stage, a useful and new methodology to assess the state of enclosures before excavation is proposed. Its use would allow to reduce impacts on groundwater (construction and operation stages) and costs in case of defects {{as well as to}} increase the safety during the construction. The groundwater response regarding different scenarios of <b>diaphragm</b> <b>walls</b> is studied numerically in order to propose a successful procedure to evaluate underground enclosures imperviousness by internal pumping tests.
