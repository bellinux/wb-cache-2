40|$|The {{characteristics}} of urban runoffs {{and their impact}} on rainwater utilization and storm pollution control were investigated in three different functional areas of Zhengzhou City, China. The results showed that in the same rain event the pollutant loads (chemical oxygen demand (COD) and total suspended solids (TSS)) in the sampling areas were in the order of industrial area > commercial area > residential area, and within the same area the COD and TSS concentrations of road runoffs were higher than those of roof runoffs. The first flush effects in roof and road runoffs were observed, hence the initial rainwater should be treated separately to reduce rainwater utilization cost and control storm pollution. The <b>initial</b> roof <b>rainfall</b> of 2 mm in residential area, 5 mm in commercial area and 10 mm in industrial area, and the <b>initial</b> road <b>rainfall</b> of 4 mm in residential area and all the road rainfall in commercial and industrial areas should be collected and treated accordingly before direct discharge or utilization. Based on the strong correlation between COD and TSS (R(2), 0. 87 - 0. 95) and the low biodegradation capacity (biochemical oxygen demand BOD(5) /COD < 0. 3), a sedimentation process and an effective filtration system composed of soil and slag were designed to treat the initial rainwater, which could remove over 90 % of the pollutant loads.

To reducing the initial period rainwater pollution, the effective control measures must be taken for initial period rainwater.

40|$|Due to overgrazing, {{mining and}} other {{anthropogenic}} disturbances, {{large sections of}} the Karoo region have been degraded, resulting in areas with low vegetation cover, where erosion rates are high and vegetation is dominated by unpalatable species. These areas have low and unpredictable rainfall, with slow to non-existent autogenic recovery, and this often forces landowners to implement reseeding rehabilitation {{in an attempt to}} increase both overall vegetation cover and the relative abundance of palatable plants. Landowners use soil preparation treatments, which include creating micro-catchments, ripping, mulching and brush packing, to supplement land rehabilitation. This study investigated the significance of <b>initial</b> <b>rainfall,</b> mean monthly rainfall, soil preparation techniques, slope, existing vegetation cover, litter, mulch and stone cover in determining the success of reseeding rehabilitation. Rainfall had the most significant influence, where long-lived shrubs established best under low <b>initial</b> <b>rainfall</b> and high mean monthly rainfall, and grasses established best after receiving high <b>initial</b> <b>rainfall.</b> Micro-catchments proved the most successful soil preparation technique for the establishment of long-lived shrubs, while ripping and mulching impacted negatively on grass establishment. A combination of mulch and micro-catchments aided Osteospermum sinuatum establishment in soils where soil shrinkage cracks occurred. Temperature influenced seed germination and drought tolerance of Lessertia annularis, Fingerhuthia africana and O. sinuatum, with higher germination success of O. sinuatum under temperatures simulating summer, and of F. africana under temperatures simulating winter. L. annularis germination had a faster growth rate and higher survival when germinated under autumn/spring temperatures.

Baseflow is restored by leaking rainwater {{at the rate of}} 240 L/day. Storm initial loss is the sum of rainfall from the start of an event until the tank overflows. Results show the ARD system provides superior initial loss emulation, reduced mean annual overflow and increased baseflow, under the low demand scenario. Leaking and ARD systems provide similar results under the high demand scenario. However, the ARD system is recommended as rainwater demand can change with occupant water use habits. These stormwater management outcomes can potentially create an avenue for retrofitting WSUD in urban catchments and improving urban stream health, without duplicating or redesigning municipal services, and while maintaining an alternate water supply. ...|$|E

To provide a contribution to this topic, the paper proposes an engineering reference framework to evaluate the amount of both rainfall infiltrating the ground surface and runoff flowing as wash out and remarks are outlined {{as far as the}} time to runoff and the slope failure time.

Furthermore, slope stability analyses show that time to failure can be either shorter or longer than time to runoff depending on soil mechanical parameters.

40|$|Central Florida is {{the ideal}} test {{laboratory}} for studying convergence zone-induced convection. The region regularly experiences sea breeze fronts and rainfall-induced outflow boundaries. The focus {{of this study is}} the common yet poorly-studied convergence zone established by the interaction of the sea breeze front and an outflow boundary. Previous studies have investigated mechanisms primarily affecting storm initiation by such convergence zones. Few have focused on rainfall morphology yet these storms contribute a significant amount precipitation to the annual rainfall budget. Low-level convergence and mid-tropospheric moisture have both been shown to correlate with rainfall amounts in Florida. Using 2 D and 3 D numerical simulations, the roles of low-level convergence and mid-tropospheric moisture in rainfall evolution are examined. The results indicate that time-averaged, vertical moisture flux (VMF) at the sea breeze front/outflow convergence zone is directly and linearly proportional to initial condensation rates. This proportionality establishes a similar relationship between VMF and <b>initial</b> <b>rainfall.</b> Vertical moisture flux, which encompasses depth and magnitude of convergence, is better correlated to <b>initial</b> <b>rainfall</b> production than surface moisture convergence. This extends early observational studies which linked rainfall in Florida to surface moisture convergence. The amount and distribution of mid-tropospheric moisture determines how rainfall associated with secondary cells develop. Rainfall amount and efficiency varied significantly over an observable range of relative humidities in the 850 - 500 mb layer even though rainfall evolution was similar during the initial or "first-cell" period. Rainfall variability was attributed to drier mid-tropospheric environments inhibiting secondary cell development through entrainment effects. Observationally, 850 - 500 mb moisture structure exhibits wider variability than lower level moisture, which is virtually always present in Florida. A likely consequence of the variability in 850 - 500 moisture is a stronger statistical correlation to rainfall, which observational studies have noted. The study indicates that vertical moisture flux forcing at convergence zones is critical in determining rainfall in the initial stage of development but plays a decreasing role in rainfall evolution as the system matures. The mid-tropospheric moisture (e. g. environment) plays an increasing role in rainfall evolution as the system matures. This suggests the need to improve measurements of magnitude/depth of convergence and mid-tropospheric moisture distribution. It also highlights the need for better parameterization of entrainment and vertical moisture distribution in larger-scale models...|$|E

High temporal resolution drip rate monitoring combined with monthly isotope drip water and rainfall sampling at Cathedral Cave, Australia, demonstrates that drip water discharge to the cave occurs irregularly, and only after occasional long duration and high volume rainfall events, where the soil moisture deficit and evapotranspiration is overcome. All drip waters have a water isotopic composition that is heavier than the weighted mean annual precipitation, some fall along the local meteoric water line, others trend towards an evaporation water line.

40|$|Surface {{microrelief}} affects {{overland flow}} generation {{and the related}} hydrologic processes. However, such influences vary depending on other factors such as rainfall characteristics, soil properties, and initial soil moisture conditions. Thus, in-depth {{research is needed to}} better understand and evaluate the combined effects of these factors on overland flow dynamics. The objective of this experimental study was to examine how surface microrelief, in conjunction with the factors of rainfall, soil, and initial moisture conditions, impacts overland flow generation and runoff processes in both laboratory and field settings. A series of overland flow experiments were conducted for rough and smooth surfaces that represented distinct microtopographic characteristics and the experimental data were analyzed and compared. Across different soil types and initial moisture conditions, both laboratory and field experiments demonstrated that a rough soil surface experienced a delayed initiation of runoff and featured a stepwise threshold flow pattern due to the microrelief-controlled puddle filling-spilling-merging dynamics. It was found from the field experiments that a smooth plot surface was more responsive to rainfall variations especially during an <b>initial</b> <b>rainfall</b> event.

In order to improve the practicability of the LCM model, r= 0. 833 with λ= 0. 2 is reasonable for simplifying calculation.

40|$|The {{continuous}} {{collection of}} both hydrological and Meteorological data {{has been a}} problem in most areas of the world. Therefore, such data normally have gaps in the time series. For proper water quality management of any river or lake basin there must be a basis for quantification of pollution loads transported in the water. This is only possible if discharge data is known for the duration of study. In order to fill gaps existing in such data, a modelling approach can be employed to generate the missing data. An appropriate model must therefore be used in such cases. The changes in discharge depend on precipitation but can also be heavily influenced by various activities in the catchment. Estimation of flow for rivers Sio, Nzoia and Yala draining the northern catchment of the Kenyan basin of Lake Victoria was carried out for a 50 -year period. This study used the NAM hydrological model in order to fill in the missing data for a time series and estimate the flow.

The common understanding is that higher probability of slopes failure normally occurred after prolonged heavy rainfall or antecedent rainfall.

When the soil particles disperse into suspension and transported by water along the flowing movement, the removal particles will lead to internal erosion process.

However, issues associated with copper migration from treated wood have created increasing concerns about potential risks to non-target organisms in surrounding environments, especially those in sensitive aquatic environments. Various Best Management Practices (BMPs) that can help produce clean and residue-free wood have been developed to minimize potential chemical leaching into the surrounding environment. The effects of various BMPs were assessed by examining the copper concentrations in runoff from boards subjected to a given BMP and exposed to simulated rainfall for up to 9 hours. The results suggested that BMP method markedly affected the rate of copper losses from boards treated with ACZA, CA or ACQ. Copper losses in runoff tended to be highest during the <b>initial</b> <b>rainfall</b> exposure and then decreased to background levels. Air seasoning or kiln drying were associated with lower copper losses from boards treated with ACZA, while those steamed for 6 hours were associated with higher copper losses. Increasing ACZA retentions were associated with exponentially higher copper losses. Hot water or ammonia bathes were associated with lower copper losses from boards treated with CA or ACQ. Increasing hot water bath time from 1 to 3 hours or decreasing ammonia bath time from 3 to 1 hours tended to decrease copper losses. These results suggest that BMPs are not uniformly effective on all treatments...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{provides}} an original and simple methodology to map surface soil moisture {{with a fine}} temporal and spatial resolution over large areas based on a satellite rainfall accumulation product and soil microwave emission measurements at C-band. The first motivation {{of this study was}} to obtain high temporal frequency (~ 1 h) in order to study the possible feedback mechanisms between soil moisture and convection in West Africa. The use of soil moisture maps derived from satellite microwave measurements was not possible due to the low (at best daily) temporal resolution. Thus, a rainfall accumulation product based on Meteosat geostationary satellite measurements was used together with a simple Antecedent Precipitation Index (API) model to produce soil moisture map at the 10 &times; 10 km 2 and 30 min resolution. Due to uncertainties on the satellite-based rainfall accumulation product, derived soil moisture maps were found to be erroneous. An assimilation technique based on AMSR-E C-band measurements into a microwave emission model was developed. The assimilation technique described in this study consists of modulating the rainfall accumulation estimate between two successive AMSR-E brightness temperatures (TB) measurements in order to match simulated and observed TB. When a rainfall event happens, the <b>initial</b> <b>rainfall</b> accumulation estimate is modulated using a multiplicative factor ranging from 0 to 7. The best solution is given by the rainfall rate which minimizes the difference between observed and simulated TB. Ground-based soil moisture measurements obtained at three sites in Niger, Mali and Benin were used to assess the methodology which was found to improve the soil moisture estimates over the three sites...|$|E
40|$|In the {{framework}} of an integrated approach to urban drainage systems, first flush flows management {{is going to become}} one of the primary targets for the protection of receiving water bodies and the related pollution control. It has been demonstrated that, during storm events, the pollutant load associated with first flush flows is sometimes higher than the waste water one in ordinary conditions. However the evaluation of the first flush runoff volume and the design and optimisation of possible detention tanks and treatment facilities require a deeper understanding of the first flush phenomenon. In order to investigate runoff pollution and the relationship between pollutant load and runoff, two monitoring systems have been installed in the experimental catchment of Villa Cambiaso, University of Genoa, for sampling separately roof and road runoff. Since January 2002, both water quality and flow measurement data have been collected by analysing the following parameters: total suspended solids, COD, NH 4 +, pH and heavy metals in dissolved form (Zn, Pb, Cu, Cd, Cr, Ni). Cumulative load curves were produced for all monitored water quality parameters. As for the road runoff, the magnitude of the first flush in the monitored events strongly depends on the duration of the antecedent dry weather period, while the influence of the <b>initial</b> <b>rainfall</b> intensity was observed on the occurrence of the phenomenon. Regarding roof runoff, the entity of first flush of heavy metals in dissolved form is affected by both rainfall event characteristics (intensity and total depth) and environmental conditions prior to the rain event; the occurrence of first flush of suspended solids is mainly affected by the duration of the antecedent dry weather period, which regulates pollutant, building u...|$|E

We evaluated {{the applicability of the}} Soil and Water Assessment Tool (SWAT) model in a case study of Heeia, Pacific-island watershed that has highly permeable volcanic soils and suffers from hydrological data scarcity. Applicability of the model was enhanced with several modifications to reflect unique watershed characteristics. The calibrated model was then used {{to assess the impact of}} rainfall, temperature, and CO 2 concentration changes on the water balance of the watershed. New hydrological insights for the study regionCompared to continental watersheds, the Heeia watershed showed high <b>rainfall</b> <b>initial</b> abstraction due to high initial infiltration capacity of the soils. The simulated and observed streamflows generally showed a good agreement and satisfactory model performance demonstrating the applicability of SWAT for small island watersheds with large topographic, precipitation, and land-use gradients. The study also demonstrates methods to resolve data scarcity issues. Predicted climate change scenarios showed that the decrease in rainfall during wet season and marginal increase in dry season are the main factors for the overall decrease in water balance components. Specifically, the groundwater flow component may consistently decrease by as much as 15 % due to predicted rainfall and temperature changes by 2100, which may have serious implications on groundwater availability in the watershed...|$|R
40|$|The sensitivities of runoff {{generation}} to <b>rainfall</b> variability and <b>initial</b> wetness conditions were examined {{for a major}} flash flood event that occurred during August 29, 2003 on the upper Tagliamento river basin in the eastern Italian Alps. The Triangulated Irregular Network (TIN) -based Real-time Integrated Basin Simulator (tRIBS) distributed hydrologic model was used to simulate the hydrologic response over a range of sub-basins. The model was calibrated for the single flash flood event based on the observed hydrograph at the outlet of the basin examined (Fella basin) and was validated based on the available observed hydrographs at interior points of the basin. A series of hydrologic simulations were performed for different initial soil moisture conditions and rainfall forcing resolutions in order to evaluate the sensitivity of runoff {{generation to}} those variables. Evaluation of the results suggests that both <b>initial</b> wetness and <b>rainfall</b> resolution affect significantly the simulated peak flow and runoff volume during the flash flood event. Sensitivity to initial wetness exhibits a scale dependence with the sensitivity increasing with basin scale. The bias introduced to the basin-averaged rainfall due to aggregation {{had a significant effect}} on runoff generation for all basin scales, while the effect of variability smoothing was important only for the larger scale basins. Finally, the sensitivity of the flood hydrograph to rainfall aggregation was shown to be more important for drier initial wetness states...|$|R
