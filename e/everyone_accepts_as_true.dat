40|$|From {{a purely}} {{mathematical}} viewpoint, once a statement is rigorously proven, {{it should be}} <b>accepted</b> <b>as</b> <b>true.</b> Surprisingly, in applications, users are often reluctant to accept a rigorously proven statement until the proof is supplemented by its intuitive explanation. In this paper, we show that this seemingly unreasonable reluctance makes perfect sense: the proven statement is about the mathematical model which is an approximation to the actual system; an intuitive explanation provides some confidence that the statement holds {{not only for the}} model, but also for systems approximately equal to this model – in particular, for the actual system of interest. Users are often reluctant to accept rigorously proven results: a problem. In theoretical mathematics, once a statement is (rigorously) proven, this statement is <b>accepted</b> <b>as</b> <b>true.</b> Of course, it is nice to also have an intuitive understanding of why this statement is true (“idea of the proof”), but even withou...|$|R
