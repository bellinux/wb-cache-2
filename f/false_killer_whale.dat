5|$|The {{bottlenose}} dolphin sometimes forms mixed species groups with other species from the dolphin family, particularly larger species, {{such as the}} short-finned pilot whale, the <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> and Risso's dolphin. They also interact with smaller species, such as the Atlantic spotted dolphin and the rough-toothed dolphin. While interactions with smaller species are sometimes affiliative, {{they can also be}} hostile.|$|E
5|$|Fossils of an extinct relative, Globicephala baereckeii, {{have been}} found in Pleistocene {{deposits}} in Florida. Another Globicephala dolphin was discovered in Pliocene strata in Tuscany, Italy, and was named G. eturia. The pilot whales were also close relatives of the extinct blunt-snouted dolphin. Close living relatives of the pilot whales are the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> and Risso's dolphin.|$|E
5|$|The {{killer whale}} {{is one of}} 35 species in the oceanic dolphin family, which first {{appeared}} about 11 million years ago. The killer whale lineage probably branched off shortly thereafter. Although it has morphological similarities with the pygmy killer whale, the <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> and the pilot whales, a study of cytochrome b gene sequences by Richard LeDuc indicated that its closest extant relatives are the snubfin dolphins of the genus Orcaella.|$|E
50|$|Behavioral {{differences}} {{can also be}} used to differentiate pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> from <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales.</b> Pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> usually move slowly when at the surface whereas <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> are highly energetic. Pygmy <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> rarely bow ride but it is common in <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>False</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> {{are kept}} in captivity and studied in the wild by scientists. Several public aquaria display them. For example, Okinawa Churaumi Aquarium in Japan {{displays}} <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> in the Okichan Theater.|$|R
50|$|On January 14, 2017, an {{estimated}} 95 individuals beached {{themselves on a}} remote mangrove beach in mainland Monroe County, Florida, in the western Everglades National Park. This was the largest stranding of <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> in recorded Florida history. At least 81 died and others disappeared during the night. Two other strandings of <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> have been recorded in Florida. The first was in 1986 when 28 <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> beached near Key West. Three years later, 40 individuals beached off Cedar Key.|$|R
5|$|Finally, {{other species}} are {{encountered}} only accidentally, or so rarely in Canadian territory {{that it is}} impossible to tell whether they are permanent resident. Most of these species are cetaceans, some generally poorly known: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), the dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and K. breviceps), Blainville's and True's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris and M. mirus), the <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> (Pseudorca crassidens), and the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). The big free-tailed and evening bats (respectively Nyctinomops macrotis and Nycticeius humeralis), as well as the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) are found mostly in areas south of the U.S.-Canada frontier, and occasionally in Canada.|$|E
25|$|Various {{methods of}} feeding exist among and within species, some {{apparently}} exclusive {{to a single}} population. Fish and squid are the main food, but the <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> and the orca also feed on other marine mammals. Orcas on occasion also hunt whale species larger than themselves.|$|E
25|$|The {{killer whale}} {{is known to}} prey on {{numerous}} other toothed whale species. One example is the <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale.</b> To subdue and kill whales, orcas continuously ram them with their heads; this can sometimes kill bowhead whales, or severely injure them. Other times, they corral their prey before striking. They are typically hunted by groups of 10 or fewer killer whales, but they are seldom attacked by an individual. Calves are more commonly taken by killer whales, but adults can be targeted, as well. Groups even attack larger cetaceans such as minke whales, gray whales, and rarely sperm whales or blue whales. Other marine mammal prey species include nearly 20 species of seal, sea lion and fur seal.|$|E

25|$|In 1933, three strange {{dolphins}} beached off the Irish coast; {{they appeared}} to be hybrids between Risso's and bottlenose dolphins. This mating was later repeated in captivity, producing a hybrid calf. In captivity, a bottlenose and a rough-toothed dolphin produced hybrid offspring. A common-bottlenose hybrid lives at SeaWorld California. Other dolphin hybrids live in captivity around the world or {{have been reported in the}} wild, such as a bottlenose-Atlantic spotted hybrid. The best known hybrid is the wolphin, a false killer whale-bottlenose dolphin hybrid. The wolphin is a fertile hybrid. Two wolphins currently live at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii; the first was born in 1985 from a male <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> and a female bottlenose. Wolphins have also been observed in the wild.|$|E
25|$|The spinner dolphin feeds {{mainly on}} small mesopelagic fish, squids, and sergestid shrimps, and will dive 200–300 m {{to feed on}} them. Spinner {{dolphins}} of Hawaii are nocturnal feeders and forage in deep scattering layers, which contain many species. The dwarf spinner dolphin may feed mostly on benthic fish in reefs and shallow water. Off Oahu, Hawaii, spinner dolphins forage at night and cooperatively herd their prey into highly dense patches. They swim around the prey {{in a circle and}} a pair may swim through the circle to make a catch. Spinner dolphins are in turn preyed on by sharks. Other possible predators include the killer whale, the <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> the pygmy killer whale and the short-finned pilot whale. They are susceptible to parasites, both external ones like barnacles and remoras, and internal ones, like nematodes, trematodes, cestodes and acanthocephalans.|$|E
25|$|Various {{species of}} {{dolphins}} {{are kept in}} captivity. These small cetaceans are {{more often than not}} kept in theme parks, such as SeaWorld, commonly known as a dolphinarium. Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species of dolphin kept in dolphinariums as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity and have a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of bottlenose dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Other species kept in captivity are spotted dolphins, false killer whales and common dolphins, Commerson's dolphins, as well as rough-toothed dolphins, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. There are also fewer than ten pilot whales, Amazon river dolphins, Risso's dolphins, spinner dolphins, or tucuxi in captivity. An unusual and very rare hybrid dolphin, known as a wolphin, is kept at the Sea Life Park in Hawaii, which is a cross between a bottlenose dolphin and a <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale.</b>|$|E
40|$|SPECIES INFORMATION: <b>False</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> (Pseudorca crassidens) can {{be found}} at the {{broadest}} range of depths of all the cetaceans in Hawai#i. In Hawai#i, <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> feed primarily on mahi mahi and yellowfin tuna. They discard the internal organs, gills, and tail. To increase success of finding prey, these whales travel in a broad band that can be up to several kilometers (miles) wide. Food sharing has been documented, and they feed during the day and at night. <b>False</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> have a breeding season that lasts several months. Gestation periods range from 14 to 16 months and lactation occurs for one and a half to two years. <b>False</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> have low reproduction rates with calving intervals of approximately seven years. These whales are gregarious and form strong social bonds. They are usually found in groups of ten to twenty that belong to much larger groups of up to 40 individuals in Hawai#i and 100 individuals elsewhere. They also are found with other cetaceans, most notably the bottlenose dolphin. <b>False</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> in Hawai#i may be reproductively isolated from other populations in the Pacific; however, there are no island resident populations. DISTRIBUTION: They are found throughout the Hawaiian Islands in both shallow and deep water. In the Main Hawaiian Islands, a recent study found them off the island of Hawai#i, O#ahu, and the island group of Maui, Moloka#i, Lāna#i, and Kaho#olawe. ABUNDANCE: Barlow (2003) estimates population abundance at 268 in the entire Hawaiian Exclusive Economic Zone. <b>False</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whales</b> are rarely seen in Hawaiian waters.

25|$|With {{regard to}} living mammals, the more {{striking}} of Owen's contributions {{relate to the}} monotremes, marsupials and the anthropoid apes. He {{was also the first}} to recognize and name the two natural groups of typical Ungulate, the odd-toed (Perissodactyla) and the even-toed (Artiodactyla), while describing some fossil remains, in 1848. Most of his writings on mammals, however, deal with extinct forms, to which his attention seems to have been first directed by the remarkable fossils collected by Charles Darwin, in South America. Toxodon, from the pampas, was then described and gave the earliest clear evidence of an extinct generalized hoof animal, a pachyderm with affinities to the Rodentia, Edentata and herbivorous Cetacea. Owen's interest in South American extinct mammals then led to the recognition of the giant armadillo, which he named Glyptodon (1839) and to classic memoirs on the giant ground-sloths, Mylodon (1842) and Megatherium (1860), besides other important contributions. Owen also first described the <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> in 1863.|$|E
25|$|This {{term has}} often been misused in the US, mainly in the fishing industry, where all small {{cetaceans}} (dolphins and porpoises) are considered porpoises, while the fish dorado is called dolphin fish. In common usage the term 'whale' is used only for the larger cetacean species, while the smaller ones with a beaked or longer nose are considered 'dolphins'. The name 'dolphin' is used casually as a synonym for bottlenose dolphin, {{the most common and}} familiar species of dolphin. There are six species of dolphins commonly thought of as whales, collectively known as blackfish: the killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae and qualify as dolphins. Though the terms 'dolphin' and 'porpoise' are sometimes used interchangeably, porpoises are not considered dolphins and have different physical features such as a shorter beak and spade-shaped teeth; they also differ in their behavior. Porpoises belong to the family Phocoenidae and share a common ancestry with the Delphinidae.|$|E
25|$|Various {{species of}} toothed whales, mainly dolphins, {{are kept in}} captivity, {{as well as several}} other species of {{porpoise}} such as harbour porpoises and finless porpoises. These small cetaceans are more often than not kept in theme parks, such as SeaWorld, commonly known as a dolphinarium. Bottlenose dolphins are the most common species kept in dolphinariums, as they are relatively easy to train, have a long lifespan in captivity, and have a friendly appearance. Hundreds if not thousands of Bottlenose Dolphins live in captivity across the world, though exact numbers are hard to determine. Killer whales are well known for their performances in shows, but the number kept in captivity is very small, especially when compared to the number of bottlenose dolphins, with only 44 captives being held in aquaria as of 2012. Other species kept in captivity are spotted Dolphins, false killer whales, and common dolphins, Commerson's dolphins, as well as rough-toothed dolphins, but all in much lower numbers than the bottlenose dolphin. Also, fewer than ten pilot whales, Amazon river dolphins, Risso's dolphins, spinner dolphins, or tucuxi are in captivity.

500|$|The term [...] "whale" [...] is {{sometimes}} used interchangeably with dolphins and porpoises, {{acting as a}} synonym for Cetacea.

500|$|A typical {{killer whale}} distinctively bears a black back, white chest and sides, {{and a white}} patch above and behind the eye.

Adult killer whales are very distinctive and are not usually confused with any other sea creature. When seen from a distance, juveniles can be confused with other cetacean species, such as the <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> or Risso's dolphin. The killer whale's teeth are very strong and its jaws exert a powerful grip; the upper teeth fall into the gaps between the lower teeth when the mouth is closed. The front teeth are inclined slightly forward and outward, thus allowing the killer whale to withstand powerful jerking movements from its prey while the middle and back teeth hold it firmly in place.|$|E

500|$|Odontocetes {{are known}} as toothed whales; they have teeth and only one blowhole. They rely on their {{well-developed}} sonar {{to find their way}} in the water. Toothed whales send out ultrasonic clicks using the melon. Sound waves travel through the water. Upon striking an object in the water, the sound waves bounce back at the whale. These vibrations are received through fatty tissues in the jaw, which is then rerouted into the ear-bone and into the brain where the vibrations are interpreted. All toothed whales are opportunistic, meaning they will eat anything they can fit in their throat because they are unable to chew. These animals rely on their well-developed flippers and tail fin to propel themselves through the water; they swim by moving their fore-flippers and tail fin up and down. Whale ribs loosely articulate with their thoracic vertebrae at the proximal end, but they do not form a rigid rib cage. This adaptation allows the chest to compress during deep dives as opposed to resisting the force of water pressure. Excluding dolphins and porpoises, odontocetes consist of four families: belugas and narwhals (monodontids), sperm whales (physeterids), dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (kogiids), and beaked whales (ziphiids). There are six species, sometimes referred to as [...] "blackfish", that are dolphins commonly misconceived as whales: the killer whale, the melon-headed whale, the pygmy killer whale, the <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale,</b> and the two species of pilot whales, all of which are classified under the family Delphinidae (oceanic dolphins).|$|E
50|$|They are {{extremely}} intermediate between both parents. Since a bottlenose may have about 88 teeth and a <b>false</b> <b>killer</b> <b>whale</b> has about 44, a wholphin will have 66.
