40|$|A {{pilot study}} to {{estimate}} the survival of saithe escaping from a cod-end with 145 mm <b>diamond</b> <b>meshes</b> was done in April-May 1992 north of the Faroes. Escaped fish were collected in fine meshed net cages (2 x 2 x 5 m aluminium frame) mounted aft on a cod-end cover. After one hour trawling below 150 m depth the cages were released {{by means of an}} acoustic release system and slowly hauled up to 40 m below sea surface for UTV observations (6 - 7 days). The net cages were drifting freely with the current in the area north of the Faroes and located by means of radio tracked buoys.

None of the experimental mesh sizes proved to be adequate for N. norvegicus, since all estimated values of length of 50 % retention (L 50) were lower than the length at first maturity and those of length of 25 % retention (L 25) were lower than the legislated minimum landing size.

40|$|Trawlers {{involved}} in the Antarctic krill (Euphausia superba) fishery use different trawl designs, and very {{little is known about}} the size selectivity of the various gears. Size selectivity quantifies a given trawl’s ability to catch different sizes of a harvested entity, and this information is crucial for the management of a sustainable fishery. We established a morphological description of krill and used it in a mathematical model (FISHSELECT) to predict the selective potential of <b>diamond</b> <b>meshes</b> measuring 5 – 40 mm with mesh opening angles (oa) ranging from 10 to 90 u. We expected the majority of krill to encounter the trawl netting in random orientations due to high towing speeds and the assumed swimming capabilities of krill. However, our results indicated that size selectivity of krill is a well-defined process in which individuals encounter meshes at an optimal orientation for escapement. The simulation-based results were supported by data from experimental trawl hauls and underwater video images of the mesh geometry during fishing. Herein we present predictions for the size selectivity of a range of netting configurations relevant to the krill fishery. The methods developed and results described are important tools for selecting optimal trawl designs for krill fishing...|$|R
40|$|We {{develop a}} mixed finite-element {{approximation}} scheme for Kirchhoff plate theory {{based on the}} reformulation of Kirchhoff plate theory of Ortiz and Morris [1]. In this reformulation the moment-equilibrium problem for the rotations is in direct analogy {{to the problem of}} incompressible two-dimensional elasticity. This analogy in turn opens the way for the application of diamond approximation schemes (Hauret et al. [2]) to Kirchhoff plate theory. We show that a special class of meshes derived from an arbitrary triangulation of the domain, the <b>diamond</b> <b>meshes,</b> results in the automatic satisfaction of the corresponding inf[*]−[*]sup condition for Kirchhoff plate theory. The attendant optimal convergence properties of the diamond approximation scheme are demonstrated by means of the several standard benchmark tests. We also provide a reinterpretation of the diamond approximation scheme for Kirchhoff plate theory within the framework of discrete mechanics. In this interpretation, the discrete moment-equilibrium problem is formally identical to the classical continuous problem, and the two differ only in the choice of differential structures. It also follows that the satisfaction of the inf[*]−[*]sup condition is a property of the cohomology of a certain discrete transverse differential complex. This close connection between the classical inf[*]−[*]sup condition and cohomology evinces the important role that the topology of the discretization plays in determining convergence in mixed problems...|$|R
40|$|During {{the fishing}} process, fish {{react to a}} trawl {{with a series of}} {{behaviours}} that often are species and size specific. Thus, a thorough understanding of fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear and a scientific understanding of the ability of different gear designs to utilize or stimulate various behavioural patterns during the catching process are essential for developing more efficient, selective, and environmentally friendly trawls. Although many behavioural studies using optical and acoustic observation systems have been conducted, harsh observation conditions on the fishing grounds often hamper the ability to directly observe fish behaviour in relation to fishing gear. As an alternative to optical and acoustic methods, we developed and applied a new mathematical model to catch data to extract detailed and quantitative information about species- and size-dependent escape behaviour in towed fishing gear such as trawls. We used catch comparison data collected with a twin trawl setup; the only difference between the two trawls was that a 12 m long upper section was replaced with 800 mm <b>diamond</b> <b>meshes</b> in one of them. We investigated the length-based escape behaviour of cod (Gadus morhua), haddock (Melanogrammus aeglefinus), saithe (Pollachius virens), witch flounder (Glyptocephalus cynoglossus), and lemon sole (Microstomus kitt) and quantified the extent to which behavioural responses set limits for the large mesh panel's selective efficiency. Around 85 % of saithe, 80 % of haddock, 44 % of witch flounder, 55 % of lemon sole, and 55 % of cod (below 68 cm) contacted the large mesh panel and escaped. We also demonstrated the need to account for potential selectivity in the trawl body, as it can bias the assessment of length-based escape behaviour. Our indirect assessment of fish behaviour was in agreement with the direct observations made for the same species in a similar section of the trawl body reported in the literature...|$|R

The baskets were made and repaired by the fishermen themselves during the closed season between August 14 and May 1. The wooden putcher was gradually superseded, from 1942, by galvanised steel wire baskets and then later by baskets of aluminium wire, both of which were more seawater resistant. After 1952 the baskets at Goldcliff and Porton were exclusively aluminium, although the traditional measurements were strictly adhered to by the modern manufacturers. The galvanised putchers with 3 in square mesh were supplied flat and wired into shape by the fishermen. The aluminium putchers, with a <b>diamond</b> <b>mesh,</b> were supplied ready-formed, although at Goldcliff they were strengthened with additional wire bands. All-wire putchers were fixed to the wooden ranks by means of the two staples hammered into the wooden rails on the ranks.|$|E

This technique is used for bags, hammocks, headbands and scarves. Another type is square mesh netting which also goes back and forth in rows but is worked in the diagonal. This type of net is used for trawling.The first row starts at one corner and the last row finishes the corner diagonal to the first corner. This is often used as a foundation for lacis or net embroidery. Spiral netting is a type of netting that goes around and around in a similar manner to knitting or crochet.

Though a center of gravity in this field of research lies in the EUproject BACOMA (participants Finland Sweden, Denmark) also the corresponding national institutes of other Baltic countries (Germany, Poland, Russia) have been active with similar investigations. German experiments in 1999 dealt with the effect of the use of netting made of double instead of single yarn on the selectivity. Further research was done on modifications of codends made from netting turned 90 ° from its original orientation and on simplified versions of the so-called Multipanel codend which consists of three equal diamond and three square mesh panels. The experiments demonstrated on the one hand a definite deterioration of the selective properties in a codend made from double instead of single yarn. Constructional changes in codends made from netting turned 90 ° on the other hand brought a further improvement of the selectivity of such codends. Finally, the investigations on the Multipanel codend revealed the overwhelming influence of the square mesh panels on the selectivity success. If in a conventional diamond codend three windows are cut out starting 50 cm from the real end of the codend {{in such a way that}} the remaining parts have the same breadth as the square mesh panels to insert, the selective effect of such a codend is remarkably improved.

40|$|The {{survival}} of fish discarded after being caught {{can be improved}} by simple gear-based technical measures aimed at reducing discards. We look at the effects of three different codends on the initial health and short-term {{survival of}} trawl-caught skate (Rajidae), using a control codend (80 mm <b>diamond</b> <b>mesh</b> used as standard in the fishery) and two experimental codends (100 mm <b>diamond</b> <b>mesh</b> and 100 mm <b>diamond</b> <b>mesh</b> turned on the square). Both experimental nets reduced discarded numbers of fish by ~ 70 %, with no commercial loss. This reduction in discards had an effect in reducing the total weight of the experimental codends {{by as much as}} 80 %. We also placed 278 skate in onboard holding tanks for 48 h and evaluated the survival rates of fish caught in the different codends. Visual inspection of "health" at time zero was a good indicator of survival, because 86 % of skate with a good health score survived (p < 0. 01). From a further 1539 skate assessed for health, we show that fish caught in the control codend have the lowest proportional good health score (25 %), followed by the 100 mm <b>diamond</b> <b>mesh</b> codend (34 %) and the 100 mm square mesh codend (47 %). The health of the fish caught is related to codend weight (p = 0. 01). We conclude that technical measures aimed at reducing discards have an additional benefit; they indirectly increase discard survival, and the benefits of mitigating discards through by-catch reduction devices may be a more powerful tool in fisheries management than previously thought...|$|E
5000|$|In {{addition}} to the 4 strings used to affix the mesh piece, shooting strings are woven through the <b>diamonds</b> of the <b>mesh</b> {{in order to help}} fine-tune the pocket's characteristics.

They serve to increase the pocket's hold on the ball, as well as fine-tune the way the stick throws. They can act to change the tension of various portions of the pocket, helping to create a [...] "ramp" [...] for the ball to roll along as it exits the pocket. As of the 2013 season, the NCAA has passed a rule stating that shooting strings are limited to an area within a 4-inch arc drawn {{from the top of the}} plastic of the scoop.

40|$|To {{improve the}} cod {{stocks in the}} Baltic Sea, a number of {{regulations}} have recently been established by the International Baltic Sea Fisheries Commission (IBSFC) and the European Commission. According to these, fishermen are obliged to use nets with escape windows (BACOMA nets) with a mesh size of the escape window of 120 mm until end of September 2003. These nets however, retain only fish {{much larger than the}} legal minimum landing size would al-low. Due to the present stock structure only few of such large fish are however existent. As a consequence fishermen use a legal alternative net. This is a conventional trawl with a cod-end of 130 mm diamond-shaped meshes (IBSFC-rules of 1 st April 2002), to be increased to 140 mm on 1 st September 2003, according to the mentioned IBSFC-rule. Due legal alterations of the net by the fishermen (e. g. use of extra stiff net material) these nets have acquired extremely low selective properties, i. e. they catch very small fish and produce great amounts of discards. Due to the increase of the minimum landing size from 35 to 38 cm for cod in the Baltic, the amount of discards has even increased since the beginning of 2003. Experiments have now been carried out with the BACOMAnet on German and Swedish commercial and research vessels since arguments were brought forward that the BACOMA net was not yet sufficiently tested on commercial vessels. The results of all experiments conducted so far, are compiled and evaluated here. As a result of the Swedish, Danish and German initiative and research the European Commission reacted upon this in June 2003 and rejected the increase of the diamond-meshed non-BACOMA net from 130 mm to 140 mm in September 2003. To protect the cod stocks in the Baltic Sea more effectively the use of traditional <b>diamond</b> <b>meshed</b> cod-ends with-out escape window are prohibited in community waters without derogation, becoming effective 1 st of September 2003. To enable more effective and simplified control of the bottom trawl fishery in the Baltic Sea the principle of a ”One-Net-Rule“ is enforced. This {{is going to be the}} BACOMA net, with the meshes of the escape window being 110 mm for the time being. The description of the BACOMA net as given in the IBSFC-rules no. 10 (revision of the 28 th session, Berlin 2002) concentrates on the cod-end and the escape window but only to a less extent on the design and mesh-composition of the remaining parts of the net, such as belly and funnel and many details. Thus, the present description is not complete and leaves, according to fishermen, ample opportunity for manipulation. An initiative has been started in Germany with joint effort from scientists and the fishery to better describe the entire net and to produce a proposal for a more comprehensive description, leaving less space for manipulation. A proposal in this direction is given here and shall be seen as a starting point for a discussion and development towards an internationally uniform net, which is agreed amongst the fishery, scientists and politicians. The Baltic Sea fishery is invited to comment on this proposal, and recommendations for further improvement and specifications are welcomed. Once the design is agreed by the Baltic Fishermen Association, it shall be proposed to the IBSFC and European Commission via the Baltic Fishermen Association. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{stucture}} of {{the human}} lympl vessel wall was studied with a special reference to the muscular architecture, and also to the regional and individual differences. Twenty-eight preserved cadavers of Japanese adults and one fresh corpse were used. The specimens were prepared from them within the range macroscopically possible of obtaining necessary materials. Therefore, the smallest vessels {{were not involved in}} the present study. Besides ordinary histological procedures, film specimen method and graphical reconstruction were also applied. 1. The muscle bundles of the lymph vessel wall, ever changing their course, branching out, and anastomosing with one another, form a flat network (muscle bundle group or muscle plate). At the thicker portion, the muscular coat consists of multiple muscle plates. Their bundles intersect with one another obliquely and form <b>diamond</b> <b>meshes,</b> but there never interlace with one another like textile fabrics. Often a group of muscle bundles branches out from one muscle plate and form new musucle plate, the bundles of which are directed in another direction. Such communications of msucle bundles can be observed commonly in between each layer of the muscular coats (see below). 2. Elastica interna of the lymph vessel is poorly developed. It spreads out around the bundels of the inner longitudinal muscle, forming the elastic sheathes. Therefore, it is not necessarily of a single layer, but is often made up of a rather wide zone including longitudinal muscle bundles. 3. The muscles of the intima and the adventitia are thin, generally consisting of a single or double muscle plates running approximately longitudinally. The muscular coat of the media is thick. The muscle bundles rung enerally longitudinally in the inner layer and circularly in the outher layer with ones in transitional state in between. However, some of the vessels show all the muscle bundles of the media running longitudinally, while in others all circularly. The longitudinal muscle bundles of the intima and inner layer of the media, connecting with each other, constitute the inner longitudinal muscle of the lymph vessel. The course and obiqueness of the muscle bundles of the media are extremely irregular so that the coat offers variable patterns. 4. The regional differences {{in the structure of the}} lymph vessel are most markedly exhibited in the amount of the longitudinal and circular muscles. Furthermore, systematic differences are involved to a great extent in them, and local ones seem to be less significant. 5. Systematic differences. a) In the most peripheral lymph vessels the wall is thin, and contains only a small quantity of longitudinal muscle, suggesting the transformation to muscleless vessels. However, more proximally the wall becomes fairly thicker, the vessel showing considerable contraction. In this type the muscular coat is composed mostly of longitudinal bundles and only a few circular bundles can be recognized. Still nearer to the center the vessels are now made up of three muscular coats, namely, the inner logitudinal, the middle ciruclar and the outer longitudinal. As compared with the lumen the wall in rather thin, and contains less muscles, the contraction of the vessels growing weaker. According to these differences in the muscular architecture, author divided lymph vessels into five types. Of them the vessels consisted of three muscle coats seem to be designated as conducting lymph ducts. The thoracic duct and other lymph trunks as weel as vessels in the upper and lower limbs (excepting those in the periphery) and the chain of vessels ascending from the deep subinguinal nodes to the lumbar trunks belong to this category. Most of other medium-sized vessels belong to the vessels consisted only of longitudinal muscle...|$|R

The wall is composed of a central unit of criss-cross fibrils (/usellar Jabrlc), interlaced with parallel fibrils whose grouping appears as the spiral line (spiral line J:abric). The conus is lined with a granular or. felted sheet (sheetjfabrac). The diaphragm, at the apex of the conus, appears to be formed of fusellar fabric. The cauda is formed of fusellar and spiral fabrics with a central cavity apparently not open to tlre conus interior. An outer layer {diamond, meshJabnc) of fibrils forming a <b>diamond</b> <b>mesh</b> covers both conus and cauda, and is itself overlain by longitudi-nal rods. The apex of the cauda is formed of a second domed diaphragm of criss-cross fibrils, covered by a sheet fabric. The nema is extended distally as a series of finger-shaped increments, overlain by bandages.

Our scheme is of the same inspiration as the one called CeVe-DDFV ([9]), with a more straightforward dual mesh construction. We sketch the construction in which, starting from a given 3 D mesh (which can be non conformal and have arbitrary polygonal faces), one defines a dual mesh and a <b>diamond</b> <b>mesh,</b> reconstructs a discrete gradient, and proves the discrete duality property.

40|$|Abstract. This {{investigation}} {{examines the}} possibility of adding niobium (Nb) to the Fe-Cu system in order to obtain, after powder compaction and sintering, a binder material (bonding matrix) with the adequate wear properties needed for the fabrication of diamond impregnated tools for stone cutting. The main objective is the replacement of cobalt (Co) by Nb in the Fe-Cu-Co alloys that are currently used in diamond tools. For this purpose, a comparative study has been conducted on some selected compositions of matrices integrated in cutting discs. Results of diamond impregnated 25 wt%Fe- 50 wt%Cu- 25 wt%Nb and 25 wt%Fe- 50 wt%Cu- 25 wt%Co matrices are directly compared because all tests were conducted under similar conditions. Two types of diamonds were used: without coating and Ti-coated. After the hot-pressing cycles, the main mechanical properties of the sintered bodies were evaluated. Cutting tests under real conditions, in Porriño granite, were carried out to compare {{the performance of the}} tools. Although the mechanical properties of the matrices with Nb were different from those found in the matrices with Co, the results obtained from the cutting tests have revealed that the tools made of 25 wt%Fe- 50 wt%Cu- 25 wt%Nb and 25 wt%Fe- 50 wt%Cu- 25 wt%Co matrices, both with 50 / 60 <b>mesh</b> <b>diamonds,</b> show quite similar behaviour during the cutting operations, thus indicating that replacement of Co by Nb is a promising route to be followed in the near future...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} an {{increase}} in cod end mesh size from 55 to 60 and 70 mm and a change of <b>mesh</b> configuration from <b>diamond</b> to square <b>mesh</b> on the size selectivity for rose shrimp Parapenaeus longirostris and Norway lobster Nephrops norvegicus captured off the Portuguese south coast were evaluated. The results were analysed taking into account between-haul variation in selectivity, and indicate a significant increase in L- 50 for rose shrimp with an increase in mesh size or {{with the use of a}} square mesh cod end, while for Norway lobster only mesh configuration was found to affect this parameter. Two other important external variables were identified; the trawling depth and the cod end catch, which influence between-haul variation, by increasing the selection range for rose shrimp and Norway lobster, respectively. The results obtained suggest that an increase in the current minimum mesh size of 55 mm would be advisable for rose shrimp in order to respect the minimum landing size of 24 mm carapace length presently established for this species. Moreover, trawling for rose shrimp should be avoided at depths above 200 m, in order to avoid catches consisting almost exclusively of juveniles. Such an increase in mesh size would have a minor impact in terms of losses of individuals above the minimum landing size for Norway lobster and would contribute to reducing the amount of discards in this fishery.

40|$|An outdoor earth science museum exhibit was {{designed}} for the Exploration Station in Grover Beach, California, and will use the harvesting methods of fog as a clean water resource to educate children. The design of the exhibit has two parts: a 1 m x 1 m static Standard Fog collector for long term fog collection which rises 2 m off the ground, and a mobile six-panel display consisting of six different materials and structures of meshes, all of which could potentially {{be used in a}} large scale fog collection setting. The six-panel portion will present the children with a hands-on method of applying “fog” to different meshes and quantify the efficiency of each by measuring the amount of water collected in a trough while using qualitative observations of the collection process. The meshes were chosen during the design process using observational differences in attachment {{on the surface of the}} mesh (including droplet size and surface area), the rundown rate, and the final collection. The material types (polymers and steel) were tested with varying sizes of square, <b>diamond</b> and Raschel <b>mesh.</b> Qualitative results for the condensation of the water droplets for square steel and polyvinylchloride mesh showed a small diameter droplet size and high surface tension. The polypropylene Raschel mesh had larger drop size but the water did not bead, implying a lower surface tension. The differences in collection will allow children to see how small changes in design (i. e. material selection and mesh design) can yield large changes in outcome...|$|R
