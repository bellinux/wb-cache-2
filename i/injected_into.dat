5|$|After HIV has {{bound to}} the target cell, the HIV RNA and various enzymes, {{including}} reverse transcriptase, integrase, ribonuclease, and protease, are <b>injected</b> <b>into</b> the cell. During the microtubule-based transport to the nucleus, the viral single-strand RNA genome is transcribed into double-strand DNA, which is then integrated into a host chromosome.|$|E

5|$|If oral {{medications}} and mechanical treatments fail, the second choice is local injections: medications such as papaverine and prostaglandin that alter the blood flow and trigger erection are <b>injected</b> <b>into</b> the penis.

5|$|Portable devices {{having an}} USB On-The-Go port {{may want to}} charge and access USB {{peripheral}} at the same time, but having only a single port (both due to On-The-Go and space requirement) prevents this.

5|$|Little {{is known}} about West Alseks {{subsequent}} civilian career until early 1929. In February of that year, West Alsek, still under USSB ownership, was selected for the addition of pulverized coal-fired boilers for testing purposes. Coal pulverizers would take coal—often cheaper, inferior grades normally unsuitable for marine use—and grind them into coal dust. This dust would then be mixed with air and automatically <b>injected</b> <b>into</b> the boilers {{without the need for}} hand-feeding. West Alsek entered the Todd Brooklyn shipyard to undergo the conversion in late February.|$|E
5|$|Mara Aramov arrives {{to shoot}} Phagan, but she convinces Gabe and Lian {{that she came}} to help. The three travel to PharCom's {{warehouses}} in hopes of preventing Rhoemer from launching a missile. Lian reveals that the serum Gabe <b>injected</b> <b>into</b> the test subjects was really a lethal chemical, and Markinson was having them killed. Using the fighting between Rhoemer's terrorists and Phagan's security personnel to cover his insertion, Gabe descends into a silo and searches for the missile's detonation codes.|$|E
5|$|Other merozoites {{develop into}} {{immature}} gametocytes, {{which are the}} precursors {{of male and female}} gametes. When a fertilized mosquito bites an infected person, gametocytes are taken up with the blood and mature in the mosquito gut. The male and female gametocytes fuse and form an ookinete—a fertilized, motile zygote. Ookinetes develop into new sporozoites that migrate to the insect's salivary glands, ready to infect a new vertebrate host. The sporozoites are <b>injected</b> <b>into</b> the skin, in the saliva, when the mosquito takes a subsequent blood meal.|$|E

Also, for each ordinal tau of uncountable cofinality, we construct a continuous bijection of Cp(tau, { 0, 1 }) onto a subgroup of Cp(tau+ 1, { 0, 1 }), which is in addition a group isomorphism.

5|$|The risk {{of sexual}} {{transmission}} of syphilis {{can be reduced}} by using a latex condom. Syphilis can be effectively treated with antibiotics.

In those with neurosyphilis, intravenous penicillin G potassium or ceftriaxone is recommended. During treatment people may develop fever, headache, and muscle pains, a reaction known as Jarisch-Herxheimer.|$|E

5|$|According to Einstein's {{theory of}} special relativity, as an electron's speed {{approaches}} {{the speed of}} light, from an observer's point of view its relativistic mass increases, thereby making it {{more and more difficult}} to accelerate it from within the observer's frame of reference. The speed of an electron can approach, but never reach, the speed of light in a vacuum, c. However, when relativistic electrons—that is, electrons moving at a speed close to c—are <b>injected</b> <b>into</b> a dielectric medium such as water, where the local speed of light is significantly less than c, the electrons temporarily travel faster than light in the medium. As they interact with the medium, they generate a faint light called Cherenkov radiation.|$|E
5|$|Brown's {{government}} introduced {{monetary and}} fiscal policies {{to help keep}} the banks afloat during the financial crisis in 2008, and as a result the United Kingdom's national debt increased dramatically. The Government took majority shareholdings in Northern Rock and Royal Bank of Scotland, both of which experienced financial difficulties. Large amounts of money were <b>injected</b> <b>into</b> several other banks, including newly merged HBOS-Lloyds TSB, which received £17billion. Domestic policies focusing on education, employment and health were introduced by the administration. The Labour Party was persuaded to give Gurkhas settlement rights in Britain by the campaign of actress Joanna Lumley and attracted criticism for its handling of the Scottish Government's release of Abdelbaset al-Megrahithe only person to have been convicted over the 1988 Lockerbie bombing. Brown was also dogged by allegations of bullying.|$|E
5|$|Diagnosis of a {{cerebrospinal}} fluid leak is performed {{through a combination}} of measurement of the CSF pressure and a computed tomography myelogram (CTM) scan of the spinal column for fluid leaks. The opening fluid pressure in the spinal canal is obtained by performing a lumbar puncture, also known as a spinal tap. Once the pressure is measured, a radiocontrast agent is <b>injected</b> <b>into</b> the spinal fluid. The contrast then diffuses out through the dura sac before leaking through dural holes. This allows for a CTM with fluoroscopy to locate and image any sites of dura rupture via contrast seen outside the dura sac in the imagery.|$|E
50|$|In non-diesel {{internal}} combustion engines, {{gasoline direct injection}} (GDI), also known as petrol direct injection, direct petrol injection, spark-ignited direct injection (SIDI) and fuel-stratified injection (FSI), is a variant of fuel injection employed in modern two-stroke and four-stroke gasoline engines. The gasoline is highly pressurized, and injected via a common rail fuel line directly into the combustion chamber of each cylinder, as opposed to conventional multipoint fuel injection that <b>injects</b> fuel <b>into</b> the intake tract or cylinder port. Directly <b>injecting</b> fuel <b>into</b> the combustion chamber requires high-pressure injection, whereas low pressure is used <b>injecting</b> <b>into</b> the intake tract or cylinder port.|$|R
