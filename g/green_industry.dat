2500|$|Agriculture {{has served}} as a strong {{foundation}} for Taiwan's economic miracle. After retrocession from Japan in 1945, the government announced a long-term strategy of [...] "developing industry through agriculture, and developing agriculture through industry". As such, agriculture became the foundation for Taiwan's economic development during early years and served as an anchor for growth in industry and commerce. Where as in 1951 agricultural production accounted for 35.8% of Taiwan's GDP, by 2013 it had been vastly surpassed and its NT$475.90 billion accounted for only 1.69% of the GDP. , Taiwan's agriculture was a mixture of crops (47.88%), livestock (31.16%), fishery (20.87%) and forestry (0.09%). Since its accession into the World Trade Organization and the subsequent trade liberalization, the government has implemented new policies to develop the sector into a more competitive and modernized <b>green</b> <b>industry.</b>|$|E

40|$|AbstractThere is {{a growing}} {{interest}} in innovation for sustainability {{and the development of}} <b>green</b> <b>industries</b> and <b>green</b> jobs. But how can <b>green</b> <b>industries,</b> <b>green</b> manufacturing jobs, and green goods innovation be measured? This paper probes current and recent attempts to define and measure these categories, with a focus on studies in the UK. We review the methods, estimates and trends contained in these studies. While these efforts have value, they also raise significant conceptual and measurement issues. The paper discusses a series of these issues and considers strategies to further refine the categorization and detection of green sector enterprises. A new identification approach is put forward using search term combinations and text mining to discern green goods sector companies. This method is tested through a search of small and medium-size green goods enterprises in the UK. Findings from our search approach are presented, along with a discussion of advantages and limitations...|$|R
