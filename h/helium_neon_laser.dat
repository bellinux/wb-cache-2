40|$|Up to now all {{commercial}} interferometers only {{allow the}} determination {{of changes in the}} pathlength of the interferometer during a displacement of the measuring reflector. In contrast to this traditional incremental interferometry with frequency stabilized <b>helium</b> <b>neon</b> <b>lasers,</b> the absolute distance interferometry with tunable laser diodes allows the static measurement of distances. Consequently the main disadvantages of present interferometers such as beam loss or beam interruption can be eliminated. The emitted wavelength of the laser diode can be controlled by varying the injection current. It can also be tuned over a wide range without modehops in a single longitudinal mode. Because of their small size, their low power requirements and their low price, laser diodes provide a perspective to enlarge the scope of laser interferometers as highly sensitive measuring systems. This report describes an absolute interferometric method, which allows the measurement of distances. This is done by continuously tuning the laser wavelength and suitably analysing the corresponding phase variation of the measuring interferometer and the reference interferometer. The unknown distance can be determined as the ratio of both detected phase shifts multiplied by the reference length. This way absolute distances up to 15 m can be measured with an uncertainty of about 10 high - 6...|$|R

Methods: A review was carried out of the literature from 1960 to 2008 in the Lilacs, Medline, and PubMed databases using the following key words: Laser Therapy, Wound Healing, and Tissue repair. Results: the most frequently used types of <b>laser</b> are <b>helium</b> <b>neon</b> (HeNe) <b>lasers</b> and diode lasers, including gallium-aluminum-arsenium (GaAlAs), arsenium-gallium (AsGa), and indium-gallium-aluminum-phosphide (InGaAlP) lasers.

Conclusions: the majority of authors report that laser therapy speeds up the process of tissue repair, but further studies are suggested to determine the best parameters to be used.

40|$|The stress {{development}} and relaxation of magnetron sputtered copper and amorphous-silicon (a-Si) films {{at room temperature}} are studied. Samples were prepared {{as a function of}} pressure and deposition power. In-situ stress measurements with the wafer curvature method were made using a <b>helium</b> <b>neon</b> gas <b>laser</b> system with a 10 mm beam splitter. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and atomic force microscopy (AFM) were used to perform post-growth microstructural and surface analysis. SEM cross-section analysis was used to determine the final film thickness. Phase compositions were studied by X-ray diffraction. The growth rates of copper films decreased with increasing pressure. Copper film stress development followed a non-monotonic compressive, tensile then tensile relaxation curve. In order to investigate further the nature of the stress relaxation, stress curves both after deposition was stopped and after it is restarted were also measured. Correlations between growth rate and pressure were also observed in a-Si sputter deposition. In some contrast to what was observed for Cu deposition, stress measurement during a-Si deposition showed a trend of tensile {{development and}} relaxation at all pressures studied. In a new approach to understanding stress relaxation during film growth, an acoustic emission (AE) system is introduced to measure the AE energy during sputter deposition. Evidence shows a certain relation between the strain energy of films calculated using the measured stresses and AE energy recorded during the deposition. AE energy occurs immediately after deposition starts and follows the trend of stress development (increasing hits and energies) and relaxation (decreasing hits and energies). No further signal was detected after deposition, matching the results of stress curve measurements showing that stress magnitude after deposition stays at the same level as before deposition stopped. Results also show a lower AE energy magnitude with increasing deposition pressure...|$|R
