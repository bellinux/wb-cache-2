40|$|Abstract — Immunosuppression {{observed}} in chronic alcohol users {{is caused by}} multiple factors including the amount of alcohol consumed and alcohol-induced nutritional deficiencies. Investigators of the <b>immunotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of ethanol (ETOH) frequently concentrate {{on the effects of}} ETOH and neglect nutrition as a confounding variable. This study investigated the <b>immunotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of ETOH under variable dietary nutritional conditions. Mice were fed diets containing various levels of nutrients and ethanol for 7 weeks. Spleen cell number, and interleukin- 2 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -secretion were independent of the diet consumed, but were affected by consumption of ETOH. Body and spleen weights, and interferon-gamma secretion were modulated by ETOH as well as by diet. The results indicate that the nutritional composition of the diet consumed during concurrent administration of ETOH modulates the <b>immunotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of chronic ETOH ingestion. We conclude that the levels of various nutrients in animal diets have to be planned and controlled carefully in order to identify directly the <b>immunotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of ETOH...|$|R

The <b>immunotoxic</b> <b>effect</b> of 10 µM TBT (sublethal concentration) consists of (1) inhibition of yeast phagocytosis, Ca 2 +-ATPase activity, and respiratory burst; (2) increase in intracellular Ca 2 + concentration; and (3) alterations in cell morphology.

Treatment together with 20 µg/ml calmodulin (CaM) can partially restore the cytoskeleton architecture. These results suggest a relationship between TBT and Ca 2 + homeostasis in ascidian hemocytes. By interfering with Ca 2 +-ATPase activity through CaM inhibition, either directly or indirectly, TBT induces an excess of intracellular Ca 2 + accumulation, which first causes internal disorganization of cytoskeletal proteins and consequently inhibition of phagocytosis, beginning from chemotaxis and particle adhesion...|$|E

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells (MNC) were incubated with increasing concentrations of these metals and then cellular apoptosis was determined by flow cytometry and by DNA electrophoresis. We found that arsenic induced a significant level of apoptosis at 15 μm after 48 h of incubation. Cadmium had a similar effect, but at higher concentrations (65 μm). In addition, cadmium exerted a cytotoxic effect on MNC that seemed to be independent of the induction of apoptosis. In contrast, concentrations of lead as high as 500 μm were nontoxic and did not induce a significant degree of apoptosis. Additional experiments showed that arsenic at concentrations as low as 1 · 0 μm had a significant pro-apoptotic effect when cells were cultured in the presence of this pollutant for more than 72. Non-T cells were more susceptible than T lymphocytes to the effect of arsenic and cadmium. Interestingly, MNC from children chronically exposed to arsenic showed a high basal rate of apoptosis and a diminished in vitro sensibility to this metalloid.

In addition, SAF at all doses could not produce any signiﬁcant changes in hematological parameters, HA titer, DTH and lymphoproliferation responses, as well as in release of cytokines by isolated splenocytes (p > 0. 05). Despite a few studies demonstrating some immunomodulatory effects for saffron extract, SAF as a major constituent of saffron did not induce any marked effects in immune system parameters of mice.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Many {{biological}} and chemical agents {{have the capacity to}} alter the way the immune system functions in human and animals. This study evaluates the immunotoxicity of 20 substances used widely in work environments. METHODS: A systematic literature search on the immunotoxicity of 20 chemicals was performed. The first step was to review literature on immunotoxicity testing and testing schemes adopted for establishing immunotoxicity in humans. The second step consisted of providing a documentation on immunotoxicity of substances that are widely used in work environment, by building tables for each chemical of interest (benzene, trichloroethylene, PAHs, crystalline silica, diesel exhausts, welding fumes, asbestos, styrene, formaldehyde, toluene, vinyl chloride monomer, tetrachloroethylene, chlorophenols, 1, 3 -butadiene, mineral oils, P-dichlorobenzene, dichloromethane, xylene, 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane, ethylene oxide). The third step was the classification of substances; an index (strong, intermediate, weak, nil) was assigned {{on the basis of the}} evidence of toxicity and type of immunotoxic effects (immunosuppression, autoimmunity, hypersensitivity) on the basis of the immune responses. Finally substances were assigned a score of immunotoxic power.

Each substance was assigned an index of immunotoxic evidence, a score of immunotoxic power and type of <b>immunotoxic</b> <b>effect.</b> CONCLUSIONS: This matrix can represent a tool to identify chemicals with similar properties concerning the toxicity for the immune system, and to interpret epidemiological studies on immune-related diseases...|$|E

Histopathological examination of the DON-injected pigs revealed systemic apoptosis of lymphocytes in lymphoid tissues and hepatocytes. Apoptosis of lymphocytes and hepatocytes was confirmed by the TdT-mediated dUTP-biotin nick end-labeling (TUNEL) method and immunohistochemical staining against single-stranded DNA and cleaved caspase- 3. The number of TUNEL-positive cells in the thymus and Peyer's patches of the ileum was increased at 24 h PI compared to 6 h PI, but the peak was at 6 h PI in the liver. The mRNA expression of interleukin (IL) - 1 β, IL- 6, IL- 18, and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) -α in the spleen, thymus and mesenteric lymph nodes were determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR, and elevated expression of IL- 1 β mRNA at 6 h PI and a decrease of IL- 18 mRNA at 24 h PI were observed in the spleen.

Immunoglobulin E, thymic stromal lymphopoietin (TSLP), and interleukin- 33 (IL- 33) are integral in the etiology of childhood allergy and detectable at birth. The objective {{of this study was}} to determine the association between maternal levels of phthalates, bisphenol A (BPA), and perfluoroalkyl substances and elevated umbilical cord blood levels of IgE, TSLP, and IL- 33. This study utilized data collected in the Maternal-Infant Research on Environmental Chemicals (MIREC) Study, a trans-Canada cohort study of 2001 pregnant women. Of these women, 1258 had a singleton, term birth and cord blood sample. A Bayesian hierarchical model was employed to determine associations between log-transformed continuous variables and immune system biomarkers while adjusting for potential confounding from correlated environmental contaminants. Inverse, nonlinear associations were observed between maternal urinary MCPP levels and elevated levels of both IL- 33 /TSLP and IgE and between maternal urinary BPA levels and elevated levels of IL- 33 /TSLP. In this primarily urban Canadian population of pregnant women and their newborns, maternal urinary and plasma concentrations of phthalate metabolites, BPA, and perfluoroalkyl substances were not associated with <b>immunotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> that manifest as increased odds of elevated levels of IgE, TSLP or IL- 33...|$|R
40|$|A {{bacterial}} challenge assay {{was developed}} utilizing the earthworm, Lumbricus terrestris, {{in order to}} assess potential <b>immunotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> from exposure to specific polychlorinated biphenyl congeners. Earthworms were inoculated with Aeromonous hydrophila, establishing a 10 -day LD 50. In vitro assays for effects of PCBs on phagocytosis agreed with mammalian studies, demonstrating potent suppression of phagocytosis by the non-coplanar PCB congener 138 and no suppression by the coplanar congener 126. However, when the effects of the two PCB congeners were evaluated for suppression of resistance to a whole animal infection challenge assay, coplanar PCB 126 decreased the ability of L. terrestris to withstand infection while non-coplanar PCB 138 did not...|$|R
