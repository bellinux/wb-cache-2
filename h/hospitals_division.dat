The practices and rhetorical devices nurse managers employed in doing demarcation are treated herein as examples of “boundary-work. ” The management context is an arena which has hitherto been neglected in symbolic interactionist studies of the <b>hospital</b> <b>division</b> of labor and, as a consequence, the understanding of the processes through which occupational jurisdictions are constituted remains partial. This article aims to begin to address this gap in the literature by considering the contribution of these microsociological processes to the practical accomplishment of the <b>hospital</b> <b>division</b> of labor...|$|R

40|$|This {{second annual}} {{report of the}} Irish Maternity Indicator System (IMIS) {{provides}} national results for 30 metrics from all public maternity units and hospitals for January – December 2015. 1 The data from 2014 are also provided for comparison and reflect the latest available data for that year. 2 [See Appendix 2 for the IMIS data collection form; the data and methods of analysis are described in Appendix 5. ] Senior Managers in hospitals are now using IMIS {{on a monthly basis}} to monitor and manage their hospital activities. In the past year, staff at the maternity hospitals have been taking measures {{to improve the quality of}} their data and their data collection and reporting processes. Further, based on the improved data, measures have also been taken at maternity units to improve the quality of care delivered. During the year, HSE Acute <b>Hospitals</b> <b>Division</b> decided to use the IMIS data to populate the Maternity Patient Safety Statement, which was recommended in the report of the Chief Medical Officer into the maternity services in Midland Regional Hospital, Portlaoise (see Appendix 4). We continue to develop and maintain relationships with Quality Assurance (QA) Officers at all of the units. During 2015, we organised and facilitated two workshops where the QA Officers attended to share their experiences of IMIS and learn about new developments. The enthusiasm and collaboration from this group for the IMIS has been instrumental to its successful implementation. This 2015 national report has now been published within nine months of the year ending, deeming it to be the most current national report of its nature; next year, we plan to publish the 2016 report within the second quarter of 2017. Also in 2017, following a review of the IMIS in collaboration with staff in the maternity units, we plan to refine the definitions of the existing metrics and extend the range of metrics.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} {{left ventricular}} mass (LVM) index in hypertensive and normotensive obese individuals. METHODS: Using M mode echocardiography, 544 essential hypertensive and 106 normotensive patients were evaluated, and LVM was indexed for {{body surface area}} (LVM/BSA) and for height² (LVM/h²). The 2 indexes were then compared in both populations, in subgroups stratified according to body mass index (BMI) : or = 30 kg/m². RESULTS: The BSA index does not allow identification of significant differences between BMI subgroups. Indexing by height² provides significantly increased values for high BMI subgroups in normotensive and hypertensive populations. CONCLUSION: Left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) has been underestimated in the obese {{with the use of}} LVM/BSA because this index considers obesity as a physiological variable. Indexing by height² allows differences between BMI subgroups to become apparent and seems to be more appropriate for detecting LVH in obese populations.

40|$|PURPOSE - To {{evaluate}} diastolic dysfunction (DD) in {{essential hypertension}} {{and the influence}} of age and cardiac geometry on this parameter. METHODS - Four hundred sixty essential hypertensive patients (HT) underwent Doppler echocardiography to obtain E/A wave ratio (E/A), atrial deceleration time (ADT), and isovolumetric relaxation time (IRT). All patients were grouped according to cardiac geometric patterns (NG - normal geometry; CR - concentric remodeling; CH- concentric hypertrophy; EH - eccentric hypertrophy) and to age (60 years). One hundred six normotensives (NT) persons were also evaluated. RESULTS - A worsening of diastolic function in the HT compared with the NT, including HT with NG (E/A: NT - 1. 38 ± 0. 03 vs HT - 1. 27 ± 0. 02, p< 0. 01), was observed. A higher prevalence of DD occurred parallel to age and cardiac geometry also in the prehypertrophic groups (CR). Multiple regression analysis identified age as the most important predictor of DD (r²= 0. 30, p< 0. 01). CONCLUSION - DD was prevalent in this hypertensive population, being highly affected by age and less by heart structural parameters. DD is observed in incipient stages of hypertensive heart disease, and thus its early detection may help in the risk stratification of hypertensive patients.
