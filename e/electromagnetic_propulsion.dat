50|$|One of {{the first}} {{recorded}} discoveries regarding <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>propulsion</b> was in 1889 when Professor Elihu Thomson made public his work with electromagnetic waves and alternating currents. A few years later Emile Bachelet proposed {{the idea of a}} metal carriage levitated in air above the rails in a modern railway, which he showcased in the early 1890s. In the 1960s Eric Roberts Laithwaite developed the linear induction motor, which built upon these principles and introduced the first practical application of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>propulsion.</b> In 1966 James R. Powell and Gordon Danby patented the superconducting maglev transportation system, and after this engineers around the world raced to create the first high-speed rail. From 1984 to 1995 the first commercial automated maglev system ran in Birmingham. It was a low speed Maglev shuttle that ran from the Birmingham International Airport to the Birmingham International Railway System.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>propulsion</b> (EMP), is the {{principle}} of accelerating an object by the utilization of a flowing electrical current and magnetic fields. The electrical current is used to either create an opposing magnetic field, or to charge a field, which can then be repelled. When a current flows through a conductor in a magnetic field, an electromagnetic force known as a Lorentz force, pushes the conductor in a direction perpendicular to the conductor and the magnetic field. This repulsing force is what causes propulsion in a system designed {{to take advantage of}} the phenomenon. The term <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>propulsion</b> (EMP) can be described by its individual components: electromagneticusing electricity to create a magnetic field, and propulsionthe process of propelling something. One key difference between EMP and propulsion achieved by electric motors is that the electrical energy used for EMP is not used to produce rotational energy for motion; though both use magnetic fields and a flowing electrical current.|$|E

5000|$|Although not {{presently}} in wide use for space, {{there exist}} proven terrestrial examples of [...] "Field Propulsion", in which electromagnetic fields act upon a conducting medium such as seawater or plasma for propulsion, {{is known as}} magnetohydrodynamics or MHD. MHD is similar in operation to electric motors, however rather than using moving parts or metal conductors, fluid or plasma conductors are employed. The EMS-1 and more recently the Yamato 1 are examples of such <b>electromagnetic</b> Field <b>propulsion</b> systems, first proposed in patent [...] There is definitely potential to apply MHD to the space environment and experiments such as the NASA's electrodynamic tether, Lorentz Actuated Orbits, the wingless electromagnetic air vehicle, and magnetoplasmadynamic thruster (which does use propellant) lay a solid foundation for using [...] "fields" [...] to propel spacecraft without propellant and standard concepts of chemical thrust. Since electrodynamics is well proven science, electromagnetic fields themselves carry momentum (see the Nichols radiometer), and <b>electromagnetic</b> field <b>propulsion</b> {{is not limited to}} the ejection velocity of particle propellants, these new concepts offer tremendous potential as a future space propulsion system. They represent a radical departure from current ideas of aeronautics and rocket propulsion, and as such are controversial, but field propulsion may offer the radical breakthroughs in performance capabilities required for deep space exploration. The main limiting factors appear to the generation of the significant amounts of electrical power required and a method of strongly coupling the fields to large volumes.|$|R
5000|$|The {{science of}} <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>propulsion</b> {{does not have}} origins with any one {{individual}} and has application in many different fields.

Current applications can be seen in maglev trains and military railguns. Other applications that remain not widely used or still in development include ion thruster for low orbiting satellites and magnetohydrodynamic drive for ships and submarines.|$|E
5000|$|A skyhook is a {{proposed}} momentum exchange tether {{that aims to}} reduce the cost of placing payloads into space. A heavy orbiting station is connected to a cable which extends down towards the upper atmosphere. Payloads, which are much lighter than the station, are hooked {{to the end of the}} cable as it passes, and are then flung into orbit by rotation of the cable around the centre of mass. The station can then be reboosted to its original altitude by <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>propulsion,</b> rocket propulsion, or by deorbiting another object equal in mass to the payload.|$|E
50|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> <b>propulsion</b> designs which {{operate on}} the {{principle}} of reaction mass have been around {{since the start of the}} 20th century. In the 1960s, extensive research was conducted on two designs which emit high velocity ionized gases in similar ways: ion thrusters that convert propellant to ions and accelerate and eject them via electric potentials, and plasma thrusters that convert propellant to plasma ions and accelerate and eject them via plasma currents. In the latter, plasma can be generated from an intense source of microwave or other radio-frequency (RF) energy, and in combination with a resonant cavity, can be tuned to resonate at a precise frequency.|$|E
5000|$|The optimal habitat orbits {{are still}} debated, and so orbital {{stationkeeping}} {{is probably a}} commercial issue. The lunar [...] and [...] orbits are now thought to be {{too far away from}} the moon and Earth. A more modern proposal is to use a two-to-one resonance orbit that alternately has a close, low-energy (cheap) approach to the moon, and then to the Earth. This provides quick, inexpensive access to both raw materials and the major market. Most colony designs plan to use <b>electromagnetic</b> tether <b>propulsion,</b> or mass drivers used as rocket motors. The advantage of these is that they either use no reaction mass at all, or use cheap reaction mass.|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} a new methodological {{approach}} to electrodynamics based on a fluidic viewpoint. We develop a systematic approach establishing analogies between physical magnitudes and isomorphism (structure-preserving mappings) between systems of equations. This methodological approach allows us to give a general expression for the hydromotive force, thus re-obtaining the Navier-Stokes equation departing from the an appropriate electromotive force. From this ground we offer a fluidic approach to different kind of issues with interest in propulsion, e. g., the force exerted by a charged particle on a body carrying current; the magnetic force between two parallel currents; the Magnus's force. It is shown how the intermingle between the fluid vectors fields and electromagnetic fields lead to new insights on their dynamics.

40|$|International audienceRecently, we have {{proposed}} to use {{both positive and}} negative ions for thrust in an <b>electromagnetic</b> space <b>propulsion</b> system. This concept is called PEGASES for Plasma Propulsion with Electronegative GASES and has been patented by the Ecole Polytechnique in France in 2007. The basic idea is to create a stratified plasma with an electron free (ion-ion plasma) region at the periphery of a highly ionized plasma core such that {{both positive and negative}} ions can be extracted and accelerated to provide thrust. As the extracted beam is globally neutral {{there is no need for}} a downstream neutralizer. The recombination of positive and negative ions is very efficient and will result in a fast recombination downstream of the thruster and hence there is no creation of a plasma plume downstream. The first PEGASES prototype, designed in 2007, has recently been installed in a small vacuum chamber for preliminary tests in our laboratory and the first results have been presented in several conferences. This paper reviews important work that has been used in the process of designing the first PEGASES prototype...|$|R
50|$|A linear {{induction}} motor consists of two parts: the primary coil assembly and the reaction plate. The primary coil assembly consists of phase windings surrounded by steel laminations, and includes a thermal sensor within a thermal epoxy. The reaction plate consists of a 3.2 mm (0.125 inch) thick aluminum or copper plate bonded to a 6.4 mm (0.25 inch) thick cold rolled steel sheet. There is an air gap between these two parts that creates the frictionless property an <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>propulsion</b> system encompasses. Functioning of a linear {{induction motor}} begins with an AC force that is supplied to the coil windings within the primary coil assembly. This creates a traveling magnetic field that induces a current in the reaction plate, which then creates its own magnetic field. The magnetic fields in the primary coil assembly and reaction plate alternate, which generates force and direct linear motion.|$|E

40|$|<b>Electromagnetic</b> (RF) plasma-based <b>propulsion</b> {{systems have}} gained {{increasing}} interest, as able to yield continuous thrust and controllable and wide-ranging exhaust velocities. An RF plasma thruster essentially features a plasma source, a booster unit and a magnetic nozzle. The usual {{choice for the}} booster is the ion-cyclotron resonance heating (ICRH), a well-established technology in fusion experiments to convey RF powers to magnetized plasmas. To help design the booster unit, TOPICA was extended to deal with magnetized cylindrical inhomogeneous plasmas [1]. The latter required a new module in charge of solving Maxwell's equations within the plasma to obtain the pertinent Green's function in the Fourier domain, i. e. {{the relation between the}} transverse magnetic and electric fields at the air-plasma interface. Calculating the antenna impedance - and hence the plasma loading-relies on an integral-equation formulation and subsequent finite-element weighted-residual scheme to evaluate the current density distribution on the conducting bodies and at the air-plasma interface. In this work the design of an ICRH stage with TOPICA is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A new {{approach}} for the <b>electromagnetic</b> control and <b>propulsion</b> of a current carrying electric arc plasma ring is described. The {{essence of the}} approach is to form and manipulate the arc plasma outside rather than inside an electromagnetic field (B-field) producing coil so that pulsed plasma thrusts can be produced in a choice of different directions. The interaction of the electric arc, formed in atmospheric pressure air, with such B-field has been investigated. It {{has been shown that}} a stable azimuthal plasma ring can rapidly be produced by the simple process of separating two annular contacts. Pulsed plasma propulsion is obtained when the arc plasma, and B-field sustaining current is automatically reduced to zero, whereby the constraining electromagnetic forces are removed and, as a consequence, the resulting plasma ring radially expands outwards. Several different measurement techniques have been deployed for investigating the behavior of the plasma ring. These include electrical probing, B-field probing, and high-speed plus video photography. Experimental results are shown to be in good agreement with theoretical estimates based upon a Sedov's self-similar model...|$|R

40|$|Recent {{advances}} in <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>propulsion</b> {{have made the}} use of such devices practical and cost-effective for unmanned probes and satellites within the solar system. These propulsion methods are more efficient than conventional methods, but they operate at a much lower level of thrust.

Instead of the usual tightly controlled bursts of thrust, separated by long periods of gliding, <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>propulsion</b> systems are thrusting for close to the entire duration of their flight, slowly accelerating or decelerating. This project was intended to design both the specific parameters of the pulsed plasma thruster (PPT), one of the <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>propulsion</b> systems currently under research at NASA, as well as to examine at the potential control and navigation systems that would include a PPT. The modelling of the details of the physics of the PPT proved to be outside of the scope of a semester project, and so the model of the control system became the new focus.

40|$|Some {{problems}} in electro dynamics {{have been studied}} {{in the light of}} electromagnetic field theory and computational techniques. One is that of the retrograde motion of the electric arc – an old and intriguing problem of physics. A more complete model based on electrodynamics has been proposed for study of this problem. In this model, the plasma column is treated as a flexible conductor. The associated 3 -dimensional boundary-value problem was solved by the boundary element method (BEM). It has been shown that the retrograde motion can indeed be understood in terms of electrodynamics and a number of the reported features of this phenomenon have been explained by the proposed model. The others are concerned with a recent controversy in electrodynamics. It has been discussed in the thesis that Lorentz and Ampere force laws are equivalent in the sense of magnetostatics provided that the latter is appropriately used. The interactions of electromagnetic forces on the systems of the <b>electromagnetic</b> jet <b>propulsion</b> and the <b>electromagnetic</b> impulse pendulum have been examined. It turns out that the observations are consistent with the laws of electromagnetic energy and momentum. Two aspects of the water-arc explosion problem have been studied. One is the electromagnetic (EM) aspect which is calculated by the method of separation of the variables, the other is the magnetohydrodyuamic (MHD) aspect which is solved by the finite difference method (FDM). The numerical results of the two aspects show that neither the pure EM model nor the MHD model for the incompressible fluid could explain the explosive phenomenon; this strongly suggests that the shock wave produced by the under-water arc must account for the phenomenon. On the wire fragmentation, a preliminary study has shown that this phenomenon could be caused by the electromagnetically driven stress waves and a theoretical model has been proposed for further investigation. This is described in an Appendix to the thesis. </p...|$|R
