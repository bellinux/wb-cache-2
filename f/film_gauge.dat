5000|$|... 135 is {{photographic}} film {{in a film}} format used for still photography. It is a cartridge film with a <b>film</b> <b>gauge</b> of 35 mm, typically used for hand-held photography in 35 mm film cameras. Its engineering standard for the film is controlled by ISO 1007.|$|E
50|$|In {{the case}} of motion picture film, the format may also include audio {{parameters}} (though often not). Other characteristics usually include the <b>film</b> <b>gauge,</b> pulldown method, lens anamorphosis (or lack thereof), and film gate or projector aperture dimensions, all of which need to be defined for photography as well as projection, as they may differ.|$|E
5000|$|... 28 mm {{film was}} {{introduced}} by the Pathé Film Company in 1912 under the name Pathé Kok. Geared toward the home market, 28 mm utilized diacetate film stock rather than the flammable nitrate commonly used in 35 mm. The <b>film</b> <b>gauge</b> was deliberately chosen such {{that it would be}} uneconomical to slit 35 mm nitrate film.|$|E
5000|$|More significantly, {{these new}} cine <b>film</b> <b>gauges</b> {{were the first}} truly {{practical}} formats for making casual amateur [...] "home movies" [...] of vacation trips, family gatherings, and important events such as weddings.

50|$|For the Feature and Non-Feature Films sections, {{films in}} any Indian language, shot on 16 mm, 35 mm, a wider <b>film</b> <b>gauge</b> or a digital format, and {{released}} in cinemas, on video or digital formats for home viewing were eligible.

50|$|Film perforations, {{also known}} as perfs, are the holes placed in the film stock during {{manufacturing}} and used for transporting (by sprockets and claws) and steadying (by pin registration) the film. Films may have different types of perforations depending on <b>film</b> <b>gauge,</b> film format, and intended usage. Perforations are also used as a standard measuring reference within certain camera systems {{to refer to the}} size of the frame.|$|E
5000|$|The {{choice of}} {{shooting}} format affects {{how easy it}} would be to achieve a deep focus look. This is because the size of the sensor or <b>film</b> <b>gauge</b> dictates what particular lens focal length would be used in order to achieve a desired viewing angle. Smaller sensors or film gauges will require an overall range of shorter focal lengths to achieve any desired viewing angle than larger sensors or film gauges. Because depth of field is a characteristic of lens focal length (in addition to aperture and focus distance setting), it is easier to achieve a deep-focus look with a smaller imaging sensor or <b>film</b> <b>gauge.</b> For example: a 40mm lens will give a 30-degree horizontal angle of view in the Super35 format. To achieve the same viewing angle with a 1/2" [...] 16:9 sensor, you would need a 13mm lens. A 13mm lens inherently has much more depth-of-field than a 40mm lens. To achieve the same depth of field with a 40mm lens would require a very small aperture, which in turn would require far more light, and therefore time and expense.|$|E

The film focuses on a long cycle of self-destruction in Claire and Sebastien's relationship.|$|R
5000|$|After the Second World War, {{developments}} in cinema technology stimulated {{the growth of}} a mass market, particularly the introduction of the 8mm and super-8 <b>film</b> <b>gauges</b> which resulted in the widespread use of amateur cinematography.

World War I stopped European production of 28 mm. It continued in North America until 1920 before ceasing entirely. Shortly after, 9.5 mm and 16 mm would take the amateur <b>film</b> <b>gauge</b> role 28 mm had once filled.|$|E
50|$|Super16 is a Danish {{non-traditional}} {{film school}} {{based at the}} Nordisk Film Studio in Valby, Copenhagen.

5000|$|Wings of Courage was {{the first}} IMAX 3-D short film created to be {{projected}} on the world's largest screens, with a process that uses a wider <b>film</b> <b>gauge,</b> more intense light and a brighter screen (covered with five coats of silver).

5000|$|The crucial {{advantage}} {{cellulose triacetate}} had over nitrate {{was that it}} was no more of a fire risk than paper (the stock is often erroneously referred to as [...] "non-flam": this is not true—it is combustible, but not in as volatile or as dangerous a way as nitrate), while it almost matched the cost and durability of nitrate. It remained in almost exclusive use in all <b>film</b> <b>gauges</b> until the 1980s, when polyester/PET film began to supersede it for intermediate and release printing.|$|R

50|$|British {{broadcasters}} used telerecordings {{for domestic}} purposes {{well into the}} 1960s, with 35 mm being the <b>film</b> <b>gauge</b> usually used as it produced a higher quality result. For overseas sales, 16 mm film would be used, as it was cheaper. Although domestic use of telerecording in the UK for repeat broadcasts dropped off sharply after the move to color in the late 1960s, 16 mm black and white film telerecordings were still being offered for sale by British broadcasters well into the 1970s.|$|E
50|$|High-end movie {{productions}} {{were often}} produced in this <b>film</b> <b>gauge</b> in the 1950s and 1960s and many very large screen theaters are {{still capable of}} projecting it in the 21st century. It {{is often referred to}} as 65/70, as the camera uses film 65 mm wide, but the projection prints are 70 mm wide. The extra five millimeters of film accommodated the soundtrack, usually a six track magnetic stripe. The most common theater installation would use dual gauge 35/70mm projectors.|$|E
5000|$|... 35 mm film (millimeter) is the <b>film</b> <b>gauge</b> most {{commonly}} used for motion pictures and chemical still photography (see 135 film). The name of the gauge refers to {{the width of the}} photographic film, which consists of strips 34.98 ±0.03 mm (1.377 ±0.001 inches) wide. The standard negative pulldown for movies ("single-frame" [...] format) is four perforations per frame along both edges, which results in 16 frames per foot of film. For still photography, the standard frame has eight perforations on each side.|$|E
