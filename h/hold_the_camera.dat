5|$|Because of {{the viewer}} {{backlash}} Animal Planet received for allowing meerkats from the Meerkat Manor series to die, the producers of the film debated including the filmed death of a young meerkat who was bitten by a snake. They questioned whether viewers would understand that the meerkats were wild animals and that human interference would disrupt the animals' natural life cycles. In addition, to avoid disrupting the research, crews are only allowed to film within the research area under a strictly enforced agreement not {{to interfere with the}} meerkats' lives. The producers ultimately included the scene, but the meerkat's cries for help as it lay dying were edited out. Other meerkat deaths depicted were reenactments. For Viale's death scene, the crew rigged a camera mounted on a platform {{on the side of a}} truck. Robin Smith, the film and series main cinematographer, hung partially out of the truck to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> steady, giving the visual impression of a truck bearing down on a meerkat. To provide bird and snake footage, professional handlers were employed, ensuring the meerkats were not deliberately put in danger.|$|E

50|$|In {{place of}} or to {{supplement}} a tripod, some photographers use a one-legged telescoping stand called a monopod for convenience in setup and breakdown. A monopod requires the photographer to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> in place, {{but because the}} monopod reduces the number of degrees of freedom of the camera, and also because the photographer no longer has to support {{the full weight of}} the camera, it can provide some of the same stabilization advantages as a tripod.|$|E
50|$|The Lumix DMC-L10 {{is perhaps}} most notable for the {{improvements}} to the live view facility, permitting the image to be previewed on the LCD screen when composing the shot. The Lumix DMC-L10 features a second-generation live view function that allows autofocus with live view turned on, and without the mirror moving up and down, although only with certain lenses. Even more important, the Lumix DMC-L10 is the first DSLR camera with a fully articulating LCD monitor and live view system, allowing the user to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> at pretty much any angle while still {{being able to see}} the LCD.|$|E
50|$|The {{film was}} based on the {{successful}} play Juno and the Paycock by Seán O'Casey. Hitchcock filmed a faithful reproduction of the play using few of the directorial touches he had incorporated in his previous films. Instead he often asked cinematographer Jack Cox to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> for long single shots. He was eager to have a scene set outside the flat inserted into the film, and after permission from O'Casey, added a pub scene. O'Casey made quite an impression on Hitchcock, and was the inspiration for the prophet of doom in the diner in The Birds.|$|E

5000|$|For maximum {{strength}} and stability, {{as well as}} for easy levelling, most photographic tripods are braced around collapsible telescopic legs, with a center post that moves up and down. To further allow extension, the center post can usually extend above the meeting of three legs. At the top of the tripod is the head, which includes the camera mount (usually a detachable plate with a thumbscrew to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera).</b> The head connects to the frame by several joints, allowing the camera to pan, tilt and [...] The head usually attaches to a lever so that adjustments to the orientation can be performed more delicately. Some tripods also feature integrated remote controls for a camera, though these are usually proprietary to the company that manufactured the camera.|$|E

5000|$|... 1949: VEB Zeiss Ikon (Dresden) Contax S (East Germany): second {{pentaprism}} eyelevel viewing 35 mm SLR. First M42 {{screw mount}} camera. (The East German KW Praktica came out {{at about the}} same time.) With earlier [...] "waist level" [...] SLR viewfinder systems (in which the photographer looks downward at the reflex mirror's image on the focusing screen), moving subjects are seen to track across the field-of-view in reverse direction of their actual motion, making action shooting counter-intuitive. A pentaprism is an eight-sided (only five are of significance; the other three are cut off corners) chunk of glass silvered on three sides that collects, redirects and re-reverses the light from the mirror with minimal light loss. With a proper pentaprism, all a photographer needs to do is <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> up to eyelevel and everything is there. The pentaprism SLR had first been proposed in the 19th century and was used in non-35 mm SLRs in the 1930s. Similar systems (or, in the 1990s, its cheaper alternative, the pentamirror) became so common in 35 mm SLRs by the late 1950s that it is the characteristic pentaprism [...] "head" [...] atop the camera body that defines the type for most people.|$|E
30|$|For the laparoscopic skills training, five {{validated}} laparoscopic box trainer exercises {{were used}} [7]. These exercises were placing a pipe cleaner through four small circles, placing beads {{in the form}} of a B on a board, stretching out a rubber band around 16 nails on a wooden board, cutting a circle from a rubber glove and intracorporeal knot tying. The level of performance on each task was established by adding the time to completion of a task with penalty points, consequently rewarding precision and speed. Additionally, the resulting score could be compared to a pre-established expert level, used as performance standard [7]. Three hours of hands-on training started after a 10 -min introduction video in which the exercises were explained. For each two participants, one box trainer was available. Consequently, one resident could <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera,</b> while the other performed the exercises. Approximately, half an hour was reserved for each participant per exercise. Six experts in minimally invasive gynecology supervised the training as tutors. Although not specifically trained to teach basic laparoscopic skills, they work as consultants in teaching hospitals and have at least 5  years of experience in these skills courses. They had been instructed to guide the participants through the exercises and to provide feedback and instructions on the BLS.|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} reconstruction from image sequence {{with very}} small motion {{as shown in}} (a), where the motion between images are hard to observe. (b) and (c) shows our reconstruction results and our method leads to interesting applications such as synthetic aperture effect as shown in (d), where the foreground object is in focus and the background is blurred. We have discovered that 3 D reconstruction can be achieved from a single still photographic capture due to ac-cidental motions of the photographer, even while attempt-ing to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera</b> still. Although these motions result in little baseline and therefore high depth uncertainty, in theory, we can combine many such measurements over {{the duration of the}} capture process (a few seconds) to achieve usable depth estimates. We present a novel 3 D reconstruc-tion system tailored for this problem that produces depth maps from short video sequences from standard cameras without the need for multi-lens optics, active sensors, or in-tentional motions by the photographer. This result leads to the possibility that depth maps of sufficient quality for RGB-D photography applications like perspective change, simulated aperture, and object segmentation, can come “for free ” for a significant fraction of still photographs under reasonable conditions. 1...|$|E

40|$|Pre‐Congress Oncosurgical Video Workshop - Session IV: {{abstract}} no. W. 3. 15 Since mid- 2008, we {{have started}} to perform Laparoscopic Radical Hysterectomy with Robotic Assistance (Da Vinci). The advantages of the Da Vinci Robots over conventional laparoscopic radical hysterectomy include (1) better vision: with a 3 D camera; with easy manipulation of the video camera which can be put deep into POD and still maintaining a good angle of vision; with full control by the operator; without tremor despite long hours of operation leading to fatigue of assistant holding onto the camera and better control on {{the intensity of the}} light. (2) better instruments: with the 270 degree wrist like movement of the instruments that can manipulate or operate on tissues deep in the pelvis at angles normally difficult to reach with conventional straight or slightly curved but fix instruments; the third arm for holding allows for firm and stable grape and also at position as desired by the operator; easier and more precise in dissection and suturing. (3) better ergonomics for operator and assistants: everybody can sit down with less stress on legs and backs; easier to assist with good view and no need to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> The video will try to demonstrate these advantages by showing different steps in the laparoscopic radical hysterectomy using the Da Vinci...|$|E
40|$|International audienceOBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the current place of robotics in laparoscopic urological surgery. MATERIAL AND METHODS: A {{review of the}} international literature was conducted to {{evaluate the}} various available endoscope robot systems and telemanipulator robots and to establish their practical limitations and their contribution to surgery. RESULTS: Robotic systems are based on various structures, which each present specific disadvantages. Two types of systems can be distinguished: endoscope robots and telemanipulator robots (complete robotic systems) with different degrees of complexity, dimensions and costs. Each system is different in terms of service rendered. Endoscope robot systems (EndoAssist, AESOP, LapMan) are reliable and {{eliminate the need for}} an assistant to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Man-machine interfaces can be manual, by pedal or by voice recognition. They are relatively large and expensive, limiting their diffusion at the present time. Complete instrument-handling robots (master-slave manipulators) are currently represented by 2 robots (Zeus and Da Vinci) which have demonstrated their efficacy in many difficult operations. Their very high cost and their large dimensions also constitute limitations to their diffusion, making them inaccessible to the majority of centres. The urological community has largely contributed to the evaluation of robots in laparoscopic operations, as reflected by the large number of publications. CONCLUSION: Considerable technological progress has been made over recent years to make laparoscopic surgery more accessible. Current robotized tools are still imperfect systems, but, in the future, may possibly facilitate difficult laparoscopic operations, particularly in urology...|$|E
30|$|Undergraduate medical {{education}} does not usually involve training in laparoscopic skills {{despite the fact}} that minimal access surgery has become the norm in the developed world. We designed a study to evaluate the attitude of surgeons and medical students to formal teaching of these skills. Two surveys were sent; one to fourth year medical students at the University of Bristol and another to specialist laparoscopic surgeons. Student questions centred on whether they would find training in basic laparoscopic skills useful, whilst surgeons were asked whether it would be acceptable for medical students to assist with a laparoscopic case. Sixty percent [131 / 220] of students responded, with 60  % [79 / 131] of respondents stating that they would find assisting with laparoscopic surgery beneficial, despite 79  % [103 / 131] being undecided or having no interest in a surgical career, with 66  % [87 / 131] stating it would allow them to become more involved during theatre sessions. Eighty-three percent [83 / 100] of surgeons responded, and 74  % [62 / 83] said they would allow medical students to <b>hold</b> <b>the</b> <b>camera.</b> Seventy percent [65 / 83] felt that basic knowledge of the equipment was {{the most important aspect of}} training, and 66  % [55 / 83] felt that assisting was the second most important. This is the first study to look at both the student’s and surgeon’s views on laparoscopic training of medical students. The study highlights the benefits of acquiring laparoscopic skills such as camera holding and assisting. In response, we have set up a course for students prior to placements in surgical specialties.|$|E
