5|$|By 1300, Southampton was a {{major port}} and a large provincial town, with a {{population}} of around 5,000.

By the middle of the 14th century, Southampton Castle sat alongside one and a quarter miles (2 km) of town walls, although the castle and the walls were kept administratively separate.|$|E
