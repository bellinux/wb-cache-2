25|$|In July, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation {{confirmed}} {{the election of}} Pyotr Sumin to head {{the administration of the}} Chelyabinsk oblast, something that Yeltsin had refused to accept. As a result, a situation of dual power existed in that region from July to October in 1993, with two administrations claiming legitimacy simultaneously. Another conflict involved the decision of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation regarding the regional presidency in Mordovia. The court delegated the question of legality of abolishing the post of the region's president to the Constitutional Court of Mordovia. As a result, popularly elected President , member of the pro-Yeltsin <b>Democratic</b> <b>Russia</b> movement, lost his position. Thereafter, the state news agency (ITAR-TASS) ceased to report on a number of Constitutional Court decisions.|$|E
