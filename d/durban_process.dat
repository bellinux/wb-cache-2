40|$|The eThekwini Municipality (Durban, South Africa) {{landfill}} gas Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) project {{was the first}} to be registered and verified in Africa. The idea for the project was developed in 2002, yet {{it was not until the}} end of 2006 that the smaller Component One (1 Â MW) was registered, while the larger Component Two (9 Â MW) followed only in March 2009. Valuable lessons were learnt from Component One, and these were applied to Component Two. The paper describes the <b>Durban</b> CDM <b>process,</b> the lessons learnt, and assesses the viability of {{landfill gas}} to electricity CDM projects in Africa. It concludes that small to medium sized landfill gas to electricity CDM projects are not viable in Africa unless there is a renewable energy feed-in-tariff, or unless the gas is simply flared rather than being utilised for power generation.

40|$|The <b>Durban</b> Platform <b>process</b> {{towards a}} new global climate {{agreement}} has thrown open for debate all issues, including those earlier settled in the Kyoto Protocol. Any new compact must ensure sharply reduced global emissions as required by science, while adhering to principles of equity between nations regarding utilisation of the atmospheric commons. India faces serious difficulties in reconciling international expectations and domestic developmental priorities. India's recent economic growth, increased emissions and great power ambitions suggest greater need and capacity for mitigation whereas its continuing burden of income and energy poverty severely inhibits additional commitments. This article examines the factors driving India's negotiating position. It argues that an equitable development perspective within India, a clearer appreciation of climate science and its likely impacts, and a more balanced view of its diplomatic interests especially in the global South, would yield a more coherent position than a US or first world‐driven agenda and inevitable defensive reactions...|$|R

The reason for the change was that most of those benefiting from free basic water were not poor.

These papers assess post 2020 climate policies aimed at achieving the 2 degrees C target. The assessment is based on an ensemble of scenarios consistently implemented by a suite of leading integrated assessment models. The scenarios, conceptualized as possible outcomes of the <b>Durban</b> Platform negotiation <b>process,</b> allow for a comprehensive assessment of the implementation of policies consistent with 2 degrees C in the major economies, under different assumptions about medium-term action and its distribution across regions...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. U. R. D. P.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, <b>Durban,</b> 2009. <b>Processes</b> of {{dispossession}} {{led to the}} deconstructing and reconstructing of {{new forms}} of citizenship through new political identities. Concepts of citizenship and identity are now re - emerging with the reconstruction of a new political order post 1994. Who farm dweller families are in the newly constructed polity, or how their identities are understood by the new state, will have bearing on what they can rightfully access {{as part of the}} programmes of redress and transformation. Making the argument that farm dwellers are neither ‘peasant’ nor ‘labour’ or ‘worker’ in the dominant theoretical sense the research sets out to contextualise the farm dwellers’ development dilemma. This research attempts to situate farm dweller families in a dynamic and his torically fraught political economy so that a more accurate consideration is given to the impact of future settlement options on their households’ economy. This study evaluates the relationship between farm dweller settlement patterns and their household f ood security. in the Amajuba District of KwaZulu - Natal, South Africa. The situation of the farm dweller families in the Amajuba district tells a story of extreme vulnerability. The vulnerability is a product of their dependent relationship on the owners of the land for permission to access these basic but critical livelihood needs. Their continued dependence on natural resources, rather than the cash economy, is also a product of this decades’ long relationship which has perpetuated levels of generational chronic poverty. The cycle of this level of poverty is clearly vicious and without directed targeted intervention might take generations to overcome, if it is ever broken. The political economic context of an aggressive global food industry fed by industrial forms of agriculture, the levels of vulnerability, dependency and lack of agency in the farm dweller household economy and the incredibly uncertain government settlement and agricultural policy environment, makes the feasibility of new rural settlemen ts with new forms of economic and social functionality almost unimaginable. What the research finds is that in presenting the farm dweller perspective a good motivation can be made for developing a specific targeted state intervention that has short, medium and long term trajectories to provide farm dwellers with redress, and economic development opportunities...|$|R

5000|$|The Durban {{conferences}} {{had previously}} been criticized by Western governments for allegedly promoting rather than combating racism. Australia, Austria, Bulgaria, Canada, the Czech Republic, France, Germany, Israel, Italy, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Poland, the United Kingdom and the United States all boycotted Durban III. They charged that the <b>Durban</b> <b>process</b> {{has been used to}} promote racism, intolerance, antisemitism and Holocaust denial, and to erode freedom of speech and Israel's right to exist.

40|$|There is a world-wide {{shift from}} burnt to green cane harvesting. In many countries, {{including}} the United States and South Africa, certain areas are changing to green cane harvesting due to public, tourism and environmental pressures against open field burning, increasing labour costs, {{and the potential}} use of sugarcane trash as biomass {{for the production of}} bio-products. While some countries have already converted to total green cane harvesting, of the 23 million tonnes of cane that is annually processed in South Africa, almost 85 % is still burnt. Since the 1940 s there have been factory trials all over the world on green cane processing but, due to the sheer magnitude of such trials, none have managed to shed much light on the effect on downstream processing beyond clarification. This paper reports on the effects of harvesting green billeted sugarcane compared to burnt billeted and/or whole-stalk sugarcane on factory front end processes and on downstream processing in a pilot plant. Pilot plant processing was done on samples collected from two factories situated in the Midlands area of South Africa. Sufficient cane of each treatment was harvested and processed to purge the extraction plant of other cane. Trash materials and mixed juice were collected and analysed. The effects of trash levels on prepared cane, bagasse and mixed juice are reported. Factory mixed juice (300 L) was transported to the SMRI in <b>Durban</b> and further <b>processed</b> in the SMRI pilot plant to clarified juice, syrup, A-massecuite, A-molasses, A-sugar, and affinated sugar. Various differences in physico-chemical parameters including colour and ash are presented...|$|R
