5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} {{is a disease}} of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus that is not normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern <b>in</b> <b>areas</b> <b>such</b> <b>as</b> Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected.

These proteins use the energy released from passing electrons from reduced molecules like NADH onto oxygen to pump protons across a membrane.|$|E
