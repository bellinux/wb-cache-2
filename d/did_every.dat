5|$|During the screenwriting process when Ephron {{would not}} feel like writing, she would {{interview}} people {{who worked for the}} production company. Some of the interviews appeared in the film as the interludes between certain scenes featuring couples talking about how they met, although the material was rewritten and reshot with actors. Ephron supplied the structure of the film with much of the dialogue based on the real-life friendship between Reiner and Crystal. For example, in the scene where Sally and Harry appear on a split screen, talking on the telephone while watching their respective television sets, channel surfing, was something that Crystal and Reiner <b>did</b> <b>every</b> night.|$|E

25|$|The Navy was modernized in the 1880s, {{and by the}} 1890s {{had adopted}} the naval power {{strategy}} of Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan—as indeed <b>did</b> <b>every</b> major navy. The old sailing ships were replaced by modern steel battleships, bringing them {{in line with the}} navies of Britain and Germany. In 1907, most of the Navy's battleships, with several support vessels, dubbed the Great White Fleet, were featured in a 14-month circumnavigation of the world. Ordered by President Theodore Roosevelt, it was a mission designed to demonstrate the Navy's capability to extend to the global theater.|$|E
25|$|To {{resolve the}} situation, both Scully and Summerall were paired with Madden in four-week stretches, which coincided {{with each of}} their {{respective}} absences due to other engagements. While Summerall was away calling the US Open tennis tournament for CBS as he <b>did</b> <b>every</b> September, Scully called the first four {{weeks of the season}} alongside Madden. After that Scully went on to cover the National League Championship Series and World Series for CBS Radio, as he had done for the past few Octobers, and Summerall returned to the broadcast booth to work with Madden. Scully then teamed with Stram {{for the remainder of the}} NFL season.|$|E
25|$|Just before 3 pm Kelly's superior, Wing Commander Clark, {{called him}} at home and spoke to him for 6-7 minutes. Clark called again at about 3:20 pm; the call was {{answered}} by Mrs Kelly who said that Kelly had gone {{out for a walk}} as he <b>did</b> <b>every</b> day. He appears to have gone directly to an area of woodlands known as Harrowdown Hill about a mile away from his home where he ingested up to 29 tablets of painkillers, co-proxamol, an analgesic drug and to have then cut his left wrist with a knife he had owned since his youth. His wife reported him missing shortly after midnight that night, and he was found early the next morning. Questioned on a flight to Hong Kong that day, Blair denied that anyone had been authorised to leak Kelly's identity.|$|E

25|$|Born to a Jewish {{family in}} Dublin, Molins is the cousin of two brothers, Jason and Greg Molins, who both {{played for the}} Irish men's team (though not at ODI level). Playing school cricket for Wesley College and club cricket for Railway Union, she made her under-23 debut for Ireland {{at the age of}} 16, at the 1996 European Under-23 Championship. Molins made her ODI debut for Ireland in June 1999, in a one-off game played while India were touring England. She was one of two debutants for Ireland in the match, the other being Isobel Joyce. Molins went wicketless, as <b>did</b> <b>every</b> other Irish bowler, as the two Indian opening batsmen (Reshma Gandhi and Mithali Raj) both scored unbeaten centuries. She was next {{selected}} for an ODI in July 2000, when Pakistan toured to play five ODIs and a single Test (to date, Ireland's only Test against any country). Her sole match in that series was the third ODI, when she took 2/34 from 10 overs to help Ireland win by 150 runs.|$|E

These start with Bond's showing an emotional side, visiting the grave of Casino Royale's Vesper Lynd, which he <b>did</b> <b>every</b> year. The emotional side continues with Bond asking Tracy to marry him. The character of Tracy is not as well defined as some other female leads in the Bond canon, but Benson points out {{that it may be}} the enigmatic quality that Bond falls in love with. Benson also notes that Fleming gives relatively little information about the character, only how Bond reacts to her.|$|E
500|$|Every {{tropical}} cyclone {{in the season}} was of hurricane status, or with winds at or exceeding 74mph (119km/h). [...] In only two other seasons <b>did</b> <b>every</b> cyclone attain hurricane status; those years were 1858 and 1884. [...] All five cyclones affected land; the strongest was the first storm, which caused severe damage and loss of life when it made landfall near the border between Mississippi and Alabama. [...] The second storm of the season struck Puerto Rico, where it caused over 100deaths, primarily from flooding. [...] In the middle of September, the third storm moved across Florida with strong wind gusts and light rainfall, and a week later the fourth storm passed over or north of the Lesser and Greater Antilles. [...] The last storm hit the Florida Panhandle, though damage was less than expected.|$|E

500|$|Impetus for {{the passage}} of a three-cent coin came when Congress, in January 1851, {{considered}} reducing postage rates from five cents to three. [...] In 1849, House Committee on Ways and Means chairman, Samuel Vinton, had written to Mint director Robert M. Patterson that his committee was considering both reducing the postage rate and instituting a three-cent coin. [...] Although no legislative action was then taken, Patterson had the mint prepare experimental pattern coins. The House committee proposing the 1851 bill included Dickinson's three-cent piece, and provided that it be legal tender up to 30 cents. [...] When the bill was debated in the House on January 13, 1851, New York Congressman William Duer indicated that he felt both coin and stamp should be denominated at 2 cents, and his fellow New Yorker, Orsamus Matteson, offered an amendment to that effect. [...] The amendment failed, as <b>did</b> <b>every</b> other attempt to change the legislation, including Dickinson's plea, in the Senate, to restore the requirement that the new coin be used to retire some of the Spanish silver. [...] The bill passed both houses, and became the Act of March 3, 1851 when President Millard Fillmore signed it.|$|E
500|$|Buono chose {{black and}} red for the rink's new color palette. Red was used for its {{intensity}} and energy, and black was utilized because the rink would appear larger. Additionally, usage of black would contrast more boldly with the red colors. The ceiling above the rink was removed for lighting purposes. The rink floor was also refinished with darker colors to provide better light reflection. Rigging for the lights became an artistic challenge for Buono. Working with the art department, the rigging electrics and the rigging grips, he designed a wagon wheel effect that moved with {{the motion of the}} skating and allowed the lights to be programmed, aesthetically lighting both ends of the rink and capturing the action of the skating sequences. The skate rental section, arcade and snack bar were redesigned at the rink as well, so that the areas besides the skating floor wouldn't feel monotonous. “We <b>did</b> <b>every</b> inch of that rink,” said Buono. “The carpet on the walls, painting the ceiling, putting in the lights, painting the snack bar, changing the color of the tables. We used a lot of neon and bold bright colors.” ...|$|E
