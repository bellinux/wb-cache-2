The 80 cells built into the walls surrounding the its vast courtyard were demolished by the British after the Freedom <b>Fight</b> <b>of</b> 1857, so as to prevent them from being used for anti-British activities. The cells were replaced by open arcades known as dalans.|$|E

5|$|At Sony's 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo (E3) press conference, the North American {{release date}} was {{confirmed}} as March 12, 2013. A single-player demo was shown, revealing new gameplay mechanics and combat systems. An {{encounter with the}} sea monster Charybdis {{was included in the}} demo, but this sequence was cut from the final game. Charybdis was recast as the creature that Alecto transforms into during the final <b>fight</b> <b>of</b> the game. The same day, Papy confirmed on PlayStation.Blog that a collector's edition of the game would be released. He said Ascension was being developed to feature stereoscopic 3D, but it was ultimately cut. At gamescom 2012, new multiplayer footage was shown, followed by the announcement of a multiplayer beta.|$|E

5|$|Cotto's first <b>fight</b> <b>of</b> 2004, was a fourth-round {{knockout}} {{victory over}} the former world title contender Victoriano Sosa. This was after an eventful week prior to the fight, which included Cotto having to wait four hours for his luggage to arrive (after a 2 a.m. local time arrival) at McCarran International Airport in Las Vegas, and almost being removed from the Mandalay Bay Hotel, where the fight was held, by a security guard {{who thought he was}} an unaccompanied minor.|$|E
5|$|Hughes {{made his}} mixed martial arts debut on January 1, 1998 at Joe Gaytia's JKD Challenge. He slammed his {{opponent}} {{to the ground}} in just fifteen seconds, winning via KO. The slam became his signature move. He won his next fight via submission due to strikes. Hughes fought three times at Extreme Challenge 21, on October 17, 1998 defeating Victor Hunsaker via TKO and future UFC Midleweight Champion Dave Menne via unanimous decision. In the third <b>fight</b> <b>of</b> that night he lost to then-undefeated Dennis Hallman by technical submission (guillotine choke) at 0:17 of the first round. The result was announced as a KO. In the process, Hallman handed Hughes his first professional defeat.|$|E
5|$|The final <b>fight</b> <b>of</b> Johnson's early period, {{during which}} the stake money was {{relatively}} low, was his comprehensive win over a ponderous fighter called Fry for a prize of 50guineas at Kingston. The fight, which lasted less than 30minutes, ended with Fry badly beaten up and Johnson with barely a scratch on him. This fight did not attract many supporters of the sport; it took place on 6June 1786 and was therefore during the period when the wealthy were away from London.|$|E

5|$|These repressive {{measures}} included taking prominent Serbs hostage against Serb attacks. To {{avoid being}} {{taken as a}} hostage, Stojanović paid 100,000 dinars to the Ustaše in Prijedor. Resistance began to emerge in occupied Yugoslavia; royalists and Serbian nationalists {{under the leadership of}} then-Colonel Draža Mihailović founded the Ravna Gora Movement, whose members were called Chetniks. The KPJ, led by Josip Broz Tito, prepared to rise to arms at a favourable moment. In the view of the KPJ, the fight against the Axis and its domestic collaborators would be a common <b>fight</b> <b>of</b> all Yugoslav peoples.|$|E
5|$|While Silva had an {{impending}} fight with Franklin, {{he was still}} asked about his future with Jackson. Indeed, {{in an interview with}} Fighters Only Magazine, Silva reiterated his desire to fight Jackson for a fourth time, and added that he wants it to be the final <b>fight</b> <b>of</b> his career. He also said that he no longer has problems with Jackson outside of the cage. Silva ended by saying that he spoke with Jackson at UFC 95 in London, England, and the two shook hands.|$|E
5|$|As Lucas' {{business}} prospers, {{he makes}} a point of operating quietly and dressing with a modest conservatism both as a sign of strength and to avoid attracting police attention. Also, he stays away from the drugs to avoid making hard decisions under the influence. However, Lucas violates these principles when he attends the <b>Fight</b> <b>of</b> the Century with Eva, sporting gaudy clothes that were a present by Eva; Roberts attends the fight, notices the previously unknown Lucas with even better seats than the Italian mobsters, and investigates him. Meanwhile, Lucas needs to deal with Lucchese mafia boss Dominic Cattano, who threatens to destroy Lucas' family unless he gets in on a deal, and corrupt NYPD detectives led by Nick Trupo, who attempts to extort and blackmail him to give them a cut. Lucas must also compete with local crime figure Nicky Barnes, a young gun trying to take over Harlem who has been diluting Lucas' Blue Magic and selling it under the same brand name. After the Fall of Saigon cuts off Lucas' supply, he is forced to rely on the other crime rings.|$|E

5|$|Devil's Den {{was located}} at the extreme left of the III Corps line, manned by the large brigade (six regiments and two {{companies}} of sharpshooters, 2,200 men in all) of Brigadier General J. H. Hobart Ward, in Maj. Gen. David B. Birney's division. It was {{the southern end of}} Houck's Ridge, a modest elevation on the northwest side of Plum Run Valley, made distinctive by piles of huge boulders. These boulders were not the direct avenue of approach used by the Confederates. The 3rd Arkansas and the 1st Texas drove through Rose Woods and hit Ward's line head-on. His troops had lacked the time or inclination to erect breastworks, and for over an hour both sides participated in a standup <b>fight</b> <b>of</b> unusual ferocity. In the first 30 minutes, the 20th Indiana lost more than half of its men. Its colonel, John Wheeler, was killed and its lieutenant colonel wounded. The 86th New York also lost its commander. The commander of the 3rd Arkansas fell wounded, one of 182 casualties in his regiment.|$|E
5|$|Elements of the 7th Infantry Division {{first saw}} combat in the amphibious assault on Attu Island, the western-most Japanese entrenchment in the Aleutian islands chain. Elements landed on 11 May 1943, spearheaded by the 17th Infantry Regiment. The initial {{landings}} were unopposed, but Japanese forces mounted a counteroffensive the next day, and the 7th Infantry Division fought an intense {{battle over the}} tundra against strong Japanese resistance. The division was hampered by its inexperience and poor weather and terrain conditions, but was eventually able to coordinate an effective attack. The fight for the island culminated in a battle at Chichagof Harbor, when the division destroyed all Japanese resistance on the island on 29 May, after a suicidal Japanese bayonet charge. During its first <b>fight</b> <b>of</b> the war, 600 soldiers of the division were killed, while killing 2,351 Japanese and taking 28 prisoners. After American forces secured the island chain, the 159th Infantry Regiment was ordered {{to stay on the}} island, and the 184th Infantry Regiment took its place as the 7th Division's third infantry regiment. The 184th Infantry remained with the division {{until the end of the}} war. The 159th Infantry Regiment stayed on the island for some time longer until returning to the United States, where it remained until the end of the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{fight was}} a rematch {{of the main}} event at UFC 117, also a contest for the UFC Middleweight Championship. In that match, Silva (after losing four rounds on points) made Sonnen submit to a {{triangle}} choke with 1:50 left in the fight. Sonnen landed 320 strikes against Silva, {{more than any other}} fighter since UFC 5 (when Royce Gracie landed 355 strikes against Ken Shamrock). Silva had only absorbed 166 strikes (combined) in his previous 11 matches. With the win Silva retained the UFC Middleweight Championship, his undefeated record in the UFC and extended his winning streak to 13. The bout received the <b>Fight</b> <b>of</b> the Year award at the 2010 World MMA Awards. After UFC 117 Silva defended the title twice, with KO and TKO wins over Vitor Belfort and Yushin Okami respectively. Sonnen is also undefeated since UFC 117, defeating Brian Stann and Michael Bisping and setting the stage for the most-anticipated rematch of the year.|$|E
