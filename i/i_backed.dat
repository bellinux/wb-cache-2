500|$|The album's lyrical content {{included}} several themes of empowerment, inspired by an incident of sexual harassment, with Jackson recalling [...] "the danger hit home {{when a couple}} of guys started stalking me on the street... Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. <b>I</b> <b>backed</b> them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were born, {{out of a sense of}} self-defense." [...] Its innovative fusion of dance-pop and industrial music with hip-hop and R undertones influenced the development of the new jack swing genre by bridging the gap between the latter two styles. The accompanying music videos shot for the album's singles became popular on MTV, and obtained a then-unknown Paula Abdul a recording contract for her choreography work with Jackson. Billboard stated [...] " [...] accessible sound and spectacularly choreographed videos were irresistible to MTV, and helped the channel evolve from rock programming to a broader, beat-driven musical mix." ...|$|E
500|$|The lyrics were rewritten {{to convey}} Jackson's {{feelings}} about her recent annulment from James DeBarge. It {{was the last}} song to be recorded for Control, and was ultimately chosen as the lead single for the album, as Jam and Lewis felt it best represented Jackson's outlook on life: [...] "I {{think it was very}} representative of the sparseness and the funkiness {{that the rest of the}} album had and the attitude Janet had about being in control, being mature to the point where she had definite opinions about what she wanted to say". The song was inspired by one of her experiences in Minneapolis when a group of men made sexual advances towards her outside the hotel she resided at during the recording of Control. She recalled, [...] "They were emotionally abusive. Sexually threatening. Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. <b>I</b> <b>backed</b> them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were born, out of a sense of self-defense." ...|$|E
500|$|For {{the song}} [...] "What Have You Done for Me Lately", which was {{originally}} penned {{for one of}} Jam and Lewis's own records, the lyrics were rewritten to convey Jackson's feelings about her recent annulment from James DeBarge. The song {{was chosen as the}} lead single for Control, as Jam and Lewis felt it best represented Jackson's outlook on life. [...] "Nasty", which in Jackson's opinion was the most innovative song on the album, was inspired by her experience with street harassment in Minneapolis by a group of men outside the hotel she resided at during the recording of Control. She recalled, [...] "They were emotionally abusive. Sexually threatening. Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection, I took a stand. <b>I</b> <b>backed</b> them down. That's how songs like 'Nasty' and 'What Have You Done for Me Lately' were born, {{out of a sense of}} self-defense." [...] Jimmy Jam wrote and played the keyboard arrangement, with Jackson playing the accompaniment. Background vocals were sung by Jackson, Jam and Lewis. The distinctive triplet swing beat of the song was developed by Jam on an Ensoniq Mirage keyboard. [...] "Let's Wait Awhile" [...] was centered on safe sex and abstinence, a subject of significant social commentary at the time. Jam commented that it is common practice for songwriters to use current events as a means of inspiration for lyrics and that the AIDS pandemic had raised awareness about sexually transmitted diseases. He commented, [...] "The theme of the song ('Let's Wait Awhile') was Janet's idea. She's not a preachy person. She's not telling people how to live their lives. All she's doing is offering an opinion." ...|$|E

In On a Wing and a Prayer Campese writes that, [...] "We led at 19-3 half-time, having plundered a gale-force wind in our favour {{in the first half}} at Athletic Park, Wellington. After two early Roger Gould penalty goals, I got through and found Mark Ella close by in support. Gould took it on, <b>I</b> <b>backed</b> him up and gave Gary Ella the scoring pass." ...|$|E
2500|$|In 2011 and 2012, Plunkett {{struggled}} with form and played just three Championship matches for Durham. In October 2012, Plunkett signed {{to play for}} Yorkshire. He stated, [...] "At this stage of my career, I believe that a fresh challenge would benefit me and I feel this is required to help me reach my goal of representing my country again". In his first season at Yorkshire, Plunkett played in 12 of the club's 16 matches in the County Championship, managing to take 36 wickets. He credits Jason Gillespie, Yorkshire's coach and former Australia international fast bowler, with helping him regain his confidence and felt that his problems had been exacerbated by over-coaching. In an interview in June 2014 Plunkett explained [...] "Different coaches told me different things and when you're a youngster you're like a sponge and {{take a lot of}} things in.... When I came to Yorkshire, Jason Gillespie just told me to run it and bowl quick. And when I did that <b>I</b> <b>backed</b> myself, bowled in my good areas and started picking up wickets." [...] Under the tutelage of Yorkshire coach and former Australia fast bowler Jason Gillespie, Plunkett's fortunes improved and he was awarded his county cap in 2013. The following year, Plunkett was recalled to the England Test team.|$|E
