25|$|By 1845, it {{was known}} through the work of Fresnel, Malus, and others that {{different}} materials are able to modify the direction of polarization of light when appropriately oriented, making polarized light a very powerful tool to investigate the properties of transparent materials. Faraday firmly believed that light was an electromagnetic phenomenon, and as such should be affected by electromagnetic forces. He spent considerable effort looking for evidence of electric forces affecting the polarization of light through what are now known as <b>electro-optic</b> effects, starting with decomposing electrolytes. However, his experimental methods were not sensitive enough, and the effect was only measured thirty years later by John Kerr.|$|E

25|$|The {{applications}} for sol gel-derived products are numerous. For example, scientists {{have used it}} to produce the world’s lightest materials and also some of its toughest ceramics. One of the largest application areas is thin films, which can be produced {{on a piece of}} substrate by spin coating or dip coating. Protective and decorative coatings, and <b>electro-optic</b> components can be applied to glass, metal and other types of substrates with these methods. Cast into a mold, and with further drying and heat-treatment, dense ceramic or glass articles with novel properties can be formed that cannot be created by any other method. Other coating methods include spraying, electrophoresis, inkjet printing or roll coating.|$|E
25|$|Michelson sought another measurement, {{but this}} time in an {{evacuated}} tube to avoid difficulties in interpreting the image owing to atmospheric effects. In 1930, he began a collaboration with Francis G. Pease and Fred Pearson to perform a measurement in a 1.6km tube 3 feet in diameter at the Irvine Ranch near Santa Ana, California. In multiple reflections the light path was increased to 10 miles. For {{the first time in}} history the speed of light was measured in an almost perfect vacuum of 0.5mm of mercury. Michelson died with only 36 of the 233 measurement series completed and the experiment was subsequently beset by geological instability and condensation problems before the result of 299,774±11km/s, consistent with the prevailing <b>electro-optic</b> values, was published posthumously in 1935.|$|E
25|$|An optical {{frequency}} comb {{can be generated}} by modulating the amplitude and/or phase of a continuous-wave laser with an external modulator driven by a radio-frequency source. In this manner, the frequency comb is centered around the {{optical frequency}} provided by the continuous-wave laser and the modulation frequency or repetition rate is given by the external radio-frequency source. The advantage of this method {{is that it can}} reach much higher repetition rates (>10GHz) than with mode-locked lasers and the two degrees of freedom of the comb can be set independently. The number of lines is lower than with a mode-locked laser (typically a few tens), but the bandwidth can be significantly broadened with nonlinear fibers. This type of optical frequency comb is usually called electrooptic frequency comb. The first schemes used a phase modulator inside an integrated Fabry–Perot cavity, but with advances in <b>electro-optic</b> modulators new arrangements are possible.|$|E

2500|$|In 1922, Georges Friedel {{described}} {{the structure and}} properties of liquid crystals and classified them in 3 types (nematics, smectics and cholesterics). In 1927, Vsevolod Frederiks devised the electrically switched light valve, called the Fréedericksz transition, the essential effect of all LCD technology. In 1936, the Marconi Wireless Telegraph company patented the first practical application of the technology, [...] "The Liquid Crystal Light Valve". In 1962, the first major English language publication on the subject [...] "Molecular Structure and Properties of Liquid Crystals", by Dr. George W. Gray. In 1962, Richard Williams of RCA found that liquid crystals had some interesting <b>electro-optic</b> characteristics and he realized an electro-optical effect by generating stripe-patterns in {{a thin layer of}} liquid crystal material by the application of a voltage. This effect is based on an electro-hydrodynamic instability forming what are now called [...] "Williams domains" [...] inside the liquid crystal.|$|E
2500|$|ST Kinetics {{is one of}} the few {{producers}} of both 40mm munition and weapon systems. The range of 40mm rounds include low velocity, high velocity, less-than-lethal, camera, self-destruct, airburst and enhanced blast insensitive explosive rounds. There are currently 3 weapon systems available, namely the 40mm Grenade Launcher (40GL), the 40mm Automatic Grenade Launcher (40AGL) and the 40mm Lightweight Automatic Grenade Launcher (40LWAGL, a portable version that is half the weight of conventional AGLs). The 40AGL was made in 1990, followed by the 40LWAGL in 2001 (previously called the 40mm Super Light Weight AGL). The 40AGL is mounted in combination with the 12.7-mm 50MG in the ST Kinetics' 40/50 cupola weapon system, installed on the M113 and Bionix. The 40AGL weighs 33kg without mount or ammunition. The objective of ST Kinetics in designing the 40LWAGL was to keep the grenade launcher's weight to below 20kg, or half the weight of conventional AGLs. Prototype weapons weighed around 14kg and small quantities have been sold to a few countries, including Sweden, mostly for evaluation. St Kinetics is also collaborating with Australia's Metal Storm and Electro Optics System to develop a new high-speed and recoilless 40mm grenade launcher called the Redback Lightweight. [...] The company is reportedly the world's largest producer of the 40AGL, with more than 2,000 of the 40AGLs sold to the SAF and overseas customers. [...] In 2008, the company entered into a teaming agreement with <b>Electro-Optic</b> Systems (EOS) and Metal Storm (MS) to develop a 3-shot under-barrel grenade launcher called the 3GL. [...] The 3GL is intended to replace the M203 under barrel grenade launcher for most military rifles including the M16, AK-47, SAR 21 and Steyr AUG. [...] It can also be detached to operate as a stand-alone weapon.|$|E
