2500|$|TiVo Inc. v. EchoStar Corp. is a [...] case {{stretching}} from 2004 to 2011, {{which took place}} in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Texas and the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit. TiVo Inc. sued EchoStar Corp. [...] claiming patent infringement of a DVR technology. The issues addressed during litigation included patent infringement, wording of injunctions, <b>infringing</b> <b>product</b> redesign, contempt of court orders, and contempt sanctions. Ultimately, the court held that EchoStar Corp. had indeed infringed TiVo Inc's patent and was in contempt of court for noncompliance of an injunction. The parties reached a settlement wherein EchoStar Corp. paid TiVo Inc. a licensing fee. Further, the court replaced the established contempt test with a single step test. The simplified test makes it more difficult for patent holders to prove contempt as a result of repeat infringement.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} appeal concluded, TiVo Inc. motioned to hold EchoStar Corp in {{contempt}} {{of the permanent}} injunction. The District Court utilized the two-part test for patent infringement established in KSM Fastening Systems, Inc. V. H.A. Jones Company, Inc. [...] The crux of this test involved determining whether there is “more than a colorable difference” between the original <b>infringing</b> <b>product</b> and the redesign. EchoStar claimed significant changes to their DVR system {{in order to be}} compliant with the ruling. [...] The key changes to the system were replacing the infringing event detection system with [...] "start code detection was replaced by statistical estimation, a method which EchoStar characterized as an indexless system and a brute-force search method." [...] The court determined that EchoStar Corp’s software redesign still infringed TiVo Inc. ‘389 patent; thus, EchoStar was held in contempt of the Infringement Provision of the permanent injunction.|$|E
50|$|Profits are {{calculated}} using a direct cost accounting method.

50|$|In the United States, {{a patent}} holder {{may wish to}} pursue a cause of action in the United States International Trade Commission (ITC) instead of, or in {{addition}} to, the court system. The ITC is an agency of the U.S. federal government empowered to enforce patent holders' rights under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930. In contrast to courts, which have {{a wide range of}} remedies at their disposal, including monetary damages, the ITC can grant only two forms of remedy: exclusion orders barring <b>infringing</b> <b>products</b> from being imported into the United States, and cease-and-desist orders preventing the defendants (known as respondents) in the ITC action from importing <b>infringing</b> <b>products</b> into the United States. In addition, the ITC can grant temporary relief, similar to a preliminary injunction in U.S. federal court, which prevents importation of allegedly <b>infringing</b> <b>products</b> {{for the duration of the}} ITC proceeding. In some cases, this may provide a quicker resolution to a patent owner's problems.|$|R

[...] The bill additionally required a detailed record to be created of the basis for determining damages, presumably for use during appeal procedures, and finally, the bill created new limitations on when the whole market value of an <b>infringing</b> <b>product</b> was used as the royalty base.|$|E

40|$|This case {{presents}} {{two issues}} that justify this Court’s review. First, the Federal Circuit upheld {{a finding of}} design patent infringement based on the very same Apple designs that it found functional under trade dress law. Such a counterintuitive outcome is possible because the Federal Circuit has constructed a highly constrained definition of functionality in design patent law, which {{is at odds with}} this Court’s precedent in both utility patent and trade dress cases. Coupled with its recent re-interpretation of the design patent infringement standard, the Federal Circuit’s approach to functionality makes it quite likely that defendants will be held liable for doing nothing more than implementing functional features that could not be protected with utility patents. This Court should grant review to address the relationship of functionality to design patent infringement. Second, despite Samsung’s own patents, its engineering and design work, and the fact that technologies developed by Google and countless other inventors are incorporated in Samsung’s phones, the Federal Circuit affirmed the jury’s damages award of Samsung’s entire profit from phones that were held to infringe Apple’s design patents. Under the Federal Circuit’s reading of 35 U. S. C. § 289, design patent infringers, unlike infringers of copyrights, trademarks, or utility patents on technical inventions, are liable for their entire profits from an <b>infringing</b> <b>product,</b> even if the patented design is only a minor feature of that produc...|$|E
40|$|The {{claim for}} damages is an {{effective}} sanction to react to infringements of intellectual property rights like patents, utility models, designs, copyrights and trademarks. Article 125 of the Italian Industrial Property Code expressly provides the obligation of the infringer to pay the rightholder damages to compensate the injury suffered. Damage claims in this field are not governed by the same principles which run for different property rights. The italian Supreme Court held that the right-holder can choose among three methods {{for the assessment of}} the damages suffered: 1. actual damages, including lost profits; 2. the royalty which is normally paid by a licensee; 3. the profits obtained by the infringer. Under the new Code the right-holder can elect two different remedies, a wrong one –with the three methods - and a restitutionary one, in which the basic principle is restitution and not wrong or tort, because the remedy is provided even though the infringement is not wilfully or negligently committed, and the infringer can deduct a portion of his general overheads allocated to the production and marketing of the <b>infringing</b> <b>product.</b> The claimant can award either damages and the recovery of profits which are attributable to the infringement and are not taken into account when calculating the compensatory damages. The claim is a restitutionary one and not only, or not always, a tort: or, as common law courts say, the award is not (or not only) for its loss but for an account of the profits made by the defendant {{as a result of the}} infringement. We cannot assume that all of the profits will be awarded, and so the problem, under a legal framework like the one designed by the european directives, is more and more how the profits have to be calculated. It can be assumed that in the future a right-holder will more often choose the restitutionary remedy to recover all the profits made by the infringer which are attributable to the infringement and which are not taken into account when calculating the compensatory damages. The right holder cannot recover the profits attributable to factors other than the protected property right. Whereas under English law the claimant must make an election between damages and account of profits, under the new italian Code, a successful claimant can award both damages and restitutionary remedy, to strip the defendant of its gains: the defendant is entitled to deduct from its profits certain costs incurred and must only account for the profits made as a result of the wrongdoing...|$|E
40|$|One {{fundamental}} {{impetus for}} the development of modern law stems from the need to settle disputes between neighbors. Indeed, the focus of the most-cited article in law review history, Ronald Coase 2 ̆ 7 s The Problem of Social Cost, is firmly on the issue of how the law should deal with someone who interferes {{with the use of a}} neighbor 2 ̆ 7 s property. The myriad of uses to which Coase 2 ̆ 7 s analysis has been put over the last forty years has obscured the relatively straightforward nature of the question that interested him: Should the law force an entity to bear the full cost of its behavior? When one neighbor harms another, should the law impose liability in the form of a damages action, or in the form of a tax (as suggested famously by Pigou), or, perhaps, do nothing at all? The original conundrum contemplated by Coase arises with spectacular clarity in the context of the emerging problem of pollen drift. Genetically modified (GMO) crops constitute a significant segment of agricultural production, and pollen from these crops drifts inexorably across property lines. Consider the situation faced by farmers in the United States who grow non-genetically modified (non-GMO) crops for buyers in jurisdictions that heavily regulate or forbid the sale of genetically modified food products, like the European Union or Japan, or who sell to purveyors of organic food products in the United States or elsewhere. The market for non-GMO crops is enormous, and such goods often command a premium price, but due to the widespread planting of GMO crops, non-GMO farmers run the constant risk of contamination by pollen from patented genetically modified plants. If a farmer has a forward contract for non-GMO corn for sale in Europe, and her corn fields are pollinated by a neighbor 2 ̆ 7 s genetically modified crop, then the anticipated premium from selling the non-GMO crop will be lost. More importantly, the non-GMO farmer may find herself unable to sell the contaminated crop at all. If her plants are now found to contain patented cell structures claimed by the patentee of the GMO corn, then the farmer is arguably a patent infringer and selling her crop without the patentee 2 ̆ 7 s permission will be fraught with risk. The possibility of patent law exacerbating the harm done to the victim of this type of pollution adds an intriguing twist to the original problem. Although the fact of contamination through pollen drift is very real for non-GMO farmers, the danger posed by patent law may seem far-fetched because, in most areas of the law, passive bystanders have a complete defense. Patent law, however, is based on the concept of strict liability. If a department store sells an <b>infringing</b> <b>product,</b> for example, the store is liable whether it knew the product was infringing or not. A scientist working in her lab is guilty of patent infringement even if she has no idea that the new compound she has just synthesized happens to fall within the claims of an existing patent. Monsanto Corporation, the world 2 ̆ 7 s leading agricultural biotech company, has been particularly active in using federal law to police anyone it finds to be growing its patented plants. For instance, in the famous Schmeiser litigation, Monsanto, and other commentators, took the position that a bystanding farmer could be liable for patent infringement stemming from windblown GMO pollen. In fact, Monsanto 2 ̆ 7 s lead in its industry is certainly due in part to its use of forceful investigations and prosecutions against those it suspects of patent infringement, regardless of whether such infringers act willfully or are even aware of their alleged infringement. In short, Monsanto is in the unique position of being able to take a problem that it created [...] the contamination of non-GMO plants by pollen drift from GMO plants [...] and use it to its advantage by prosecuting those bystanding farmers whose crops become contaminated. In Part I of this Article, we apply the Coase Theorem and its most useful corollary to the problem of pollen drift. We conclude that the liability of pollen polluters should be governed by balancing rules under nuisance law, to be applied on a case-by-case basis, rather than by a blanket liability or immunity rule. We also conclude that truly bystanding non-GMO farmers should have a viable defense to patent infringement because liability would result in the application of a reverse Pigovian tax that cannot be justified under accepted economic theory. Only a contextual approach can account for the wide variety of costs that must be identified before determining whether liability for genetic pollution is socially desirable. In the rest of this Article, we demonstrate that existing legal doctrines support the adoption of the framework we advocate. In order to do that more effectively, we briefly provide the background science of genetically modified plants and how their patented characteristics can be adventitiously transferred, and we also highlight the consequences of pollen drift by canvassing the multi-billion dollar market for non-GMO crops. Then, we discuss the common law nuisance and trespass doctrines that may provide farmers with an affirmative cause of action when pollen drift causes a reduction in the value of a planted crop. Finally, we discuss patent law defenses that may be available to patent infringement defendants who characterize themselves as victims of pollen drift (bystanding farmers). We find significant opportunities for true bystanding farmers to rebut patent infringement claims in the voluntary act doctrine and in the doctrines of patent misuse, unclean hands, and volenti non fit injuria. In the spirit of truly descriptive law and economics analysis, we conclude that applicable common law and equitable doctrines appear to be efficient...|$|E
