5|$|On 14 August, Canadian forces {{launched}} Operation Tractable, {{in conjunction}} with American movements northwards to Chambois. On 19 August, a brigade of the Polish 1st Armoured Division linked up with forces of the 90th U.S. Infantry Division, sealing off some 50,000 German troops <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket.</b> By 21 August, German attempts to reopen the gap had been thwarted, and all German troops trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> surrendered to Allied forces, effectively {{putting an end to}} the German 7th Army.|$|E

5|$|The Americans {{closed the}} gap in their lines on 11 November, but by then Shōji and between 2,000 and 3,000 of his men had escaped into the jungle to the south. On 12 November, Sebree's forces {{completely}} overran and killed all the remaining Japanese soldiers left <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket.</b> The Americans counted the bodies of 450–475 Japanese dead {{in the area and}} captured most of Shōji's heavy weapons and provisions. The American forces suffered 40 killed and 120 wounded in the operation.|$|E
5|$|Although the Falaise Gap was {{narrowed to}} a {{distance}} of several hundred yards, attacks and counter-attacks by two battle groups of the 1st Polish Armoured Division and the II SS Panzer Corps on Hill 262 (Mont Ormel) prevented the quick closing of the gap and thousands of German troops escaped. During two days of nearly continuous fighting, Polish forces using artillery barrages and close-quarter fighting, managed to hold off counter-attacks by seven German divisions. On 21 August, elements of the First Canadian Army relieved the Polish survivors and sealed the Falaise Pocket by linking up with the Third US Army. This led to the surrender and capture of the remaining units of the German 7th Army <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E

Bagramyan was tasked with attacking the forces <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket,</b> cross the Daugava River and, along with Third Belorussian, clear the {{surrounding}} areas of Vitebsk of German forces. Although he felt {{the plans for the}} Bagration were sound, he worried {{about the possibility of a}} German incursion by Army Group North against his forces from the north. He appealed to his superiors once more, Zhukov and Alexander Vasilevsky, to have the First Baltic Front move westward to help eliminate the Third Panzer Army, thus splitting Army Group North in two. Zhukov and Vasilevsky accepted his argument, introducing it to Stalin in a meeting on 23 May who formally approved it in a directive on 31 May.|$|E
5|$|Early in his career, Sanchez {{was praised}} {{for his ability}} to {{maintain}} composure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> amidst defensive pressure and focus on finding an open receiver to extend the team's offensive series. In his four-year career, Sanchez has had ten fourth quarter comebacks and twelve game winning drives. These characteristics were highlighted by Bill Parcells and Sam Wyche and garnered comparisons to Ben Roethlisberger. Sanchez was also noted for his proficiency in short passing situations and competitive nature; in December 2010, following dismal performances, Rex Ryan threatened to reduce Sanchez's repetitions with the first team offense during practice which infuriated Sanchez.|$|E
5|$|In early August 1941, Petrov was {{appointed}} {{commander of the}} 20th Rifle Corps in the Gomel area. On 16 August, he became commander of the new 50th Army of the Bryansk Front {{as a result of}} a Stavka directive on 14 August. The 50th Army defended the Bryansk and Kaluga approaches, and conducted unsuccessful counterattacks against a German bridgehead on the Desna River. The army's sector was relatively calm during September and around this time the 50th Army headquarters was visited by journalist Vasily Grossman. In early October, the army was surrounded during the Orel-Bryansk Defensive Operation, in an area known as the Bryansk Pocket. On 7 October, while trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> with his troops, Petrov became commander of the Bryansk Front after front commander Andrey Yeryomenko was mistakenly reported killed.|$|E

5|$|Unfortunately for the Germans, {{the bulk}} of the British Army escaped from the port of Dunkirk. The German Army {{eventually}} won the ensuing Battle of Dunkirk, forcing the Allied Armies to leave behind large amounts of equipment, but failed, through controversial circumstances, to eliminate the British manpower trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket.</b> The encirclement destroyed the best units of the French Army, including a prisoner of war total of 40,000, but significant forces did escape (139,732 British and 139,037 French). Some French forces would return to France and participate in the battles of June 1940, before surrendering {{along with the rest of}} the French armed forces on 25 June 1940, when the Armistice of 22 June took effect.|$|E
5|$|After {{a strong}} {{performance}} by rookie quarterback Browning Nagle in the team's 5–0 1992 preseason, Coslet promoted {{him to the}} starting lineup. Despite throwing {{for a total of}} 366 yards against the Atlanta Falcons in the opener, then the second-highest yardage total for a quarterback making his NFL debut, the team lost 20–17; the Jets lost their first four games. Wide receiver Al Toon retired on November 27, 1992, having suffered the ninth concussion of his career earlier in the season. Two days later, defensive end Dennis Byrd collided with teammate Scott Mersereau when Chiefs quarterback Dave Krieg stepped forward <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> as the two players were about to sandwich him. Mersereau managed to walk away and continue his career with New York, but Byrd suffered a fracture to his C-5 vertebra that left him partially paralyzed. Inspired by Byrd's persistent high spirits, New York traveled to Buffalo the following week and defeated the AFC champion Bills. The Jets finished the season 4–12.|$|E

He reasons that their relation resulted in a blood connection that helped them open the gateway to rescue her.

Just as Emma and Palmer were not part of a ghost story but a love story, the Doctor considers the same for the creatures — that the one trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> universe has been trying to reunite with its mate.

5|$|By {{the evening}} of 21 August 1944, the vast {{majority}} of the German forces remaining in the Falaise Pocket had surrendered. Nearly all of the strong German formations that had caused significant damage to the Canadian 1st Army throughout the Normandy campaign had been destroyed. Two panzer divisions—the Panzer Lehr and 9th SS—now existed in name only. The formidable 12th SS Panzer Division had lost 94% of its armour, nearly all of its field-guns and 70% of its vehicles. Several German units, notably the 2nd and the 12th SS Panzer Divisions had managed to escape east toward the Seine River, albeit without most of their motorized equipment. Conservative estimates for the number of German soldiers captured in the Falaise Pocket approach 50,000, although some estimates put total German losses (killed and captured) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Pocket</b> as high as 200,000.|$|E
5|$|In {{the case}} of '4 Minutes', Tim had a vision from the {{beginning}} of how things should go, especially sonically... When I opened up the session of '4 Minutes', there was so much going on that I knew right away that the hard part would be {{to make sure that the}} vocals would cut through and were right <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket.</b> Beginning with working on the vocals was the only way to achieve this. After that I formed all the other parts around the vocals. The other challenge was to make sure that everything in the track sounded clear and that you could hear every instrument, every syllable, every breath. Also, I do almost always work linear in time on a track. It's easier, because when you're done, you're done. So I keep working on section after section, until I get to the end of the track and then I know the whole mix is pretty close.|$|E

5|$|On April 15, {{after the}} Allies had split the pocket into two, Major-General Matthew Ridgway {{commanding}} the U.S. XVIII Airborne Corps called upon Model to surrender rather than throw {{the lives of}} the soldiers under his command away in an impossible tactical situation for Army Group B. Model's reply was that he still considered himself bound by his oath to Adolf Hitler and his sense of honour as a German field marshal, and in consequence a formal surrender was out of the question. However, instead of continuing the fight he ordered Army Group B's dissolution. The oldest and youngest soldiers were discharged from military service, and the remaining men were granted leave by order to surrender or attempt to break out at their discretion. The Fifth Panzer Army had already laid down its arms before this order was given, and Model's command communications <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket</b> was disintegrating. On 20 April, Joseph Goebbels' Propaganda Ministry in Berlin publicly denounced Army Group B as traitors to the Reich, marking the final act between Model and the Nazi regime he had served.|$|E
5|$|The {{concept of}} the {{wristwatch}} {{goes back to the}} production of the very earliest watches in the 16th century. Elizabeth I of England received a wristwatch from Robert Dudley in 1571, described as an arm watch. From the beginning, wrist watches were almost exclusively worn by women, while men used pocket-watches up until the early 20th century. This was {{not just a matter of}} fashion or prejudice; watches of the time were notoriously prone to fouling from exposure to the elements, and could only reliably be kept safe from harm if carried securely <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket.</b> When the waistcoat was introduced as a manly fashion at the court of Charles II in the 17th century, the pocket watch was tucked into its pocket. Prince Albert, the consort to Queen Victoria, introduced the 'Albert chain' accessory, designed to secure the pocket watch to the man's outergarment by way of a clip. By the mid nineteenth century, most watchmakers produced a range of wristwatches, often marketed as bracelets, for women.|$|E
5|$|Night {{was welcomed}} by the German and Polish forces {{surrounding}} Mont Ormel. Fighting was sporadic, as both sides avoided contact with one another. Frequent Polish artillery barrages interrupted German attempts {{to retreat from}} the sector. In the morning, German attacks on the position resumed. Although not as coordinated as on the day before, the attack still managed to reach {{the last of the}} Polish defenders on Mont Ormel. As the remaining Polish forces repelled the assault, their tanks were forced to use the last of their ammunition. At approximately 12:00, the last SS remnants launched a final assault on the positions of the 9th Battalion. Polish forces defeated them at point-blank range. There would be no further attacks; the two battlegroups of the Polish 1st Armoured Division had survived the onslaught, despite being surrounded by German forces for three days. Both Reynolds and McGilvray place the Polish losses on the Maczuga at 351 killed and wounded and 11 tanks lost, although Jarymowycz gives higher figures of 325 killed, 1,002 wounded, and 114 missing — approximately 20% of the division's combat strength. Within an hour, The Canadian Grenadier Guards managed to link up with what remained of Stefanowicz's men. By late afternoon, the remainder of the 2nd and 9th SS Panzer Divisions had begun their retreat to the Seine River. The Falaise Gap had been permanently closed, with a large number of German forces still trapped <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>pocket.</b>|$|E
