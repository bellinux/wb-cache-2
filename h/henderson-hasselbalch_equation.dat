Rearrangements of the median-effect equation lead to Michaelis-Menten, Hill, Scatchard, and <b>Henderson-Hasselbalch</b> <b>equations.</b> The &#x 201 c;median&#x 201 d; serves as the &#x 201 c;universal reference point&#x 201 d; and the &#x 201 c;common link&#x 201 d; for the relationship of all entities at all dynamic orders, and is also the &#x 201 c;harmonic mean&#x 201 d; of kinetic dissociation constants. Over 300 mechanism-specific equations have been derived and published using the mathematical induction-deduction process.

The physiologist focuses on molecular, cellular, and whole organ, transport processes that modulate the acidity of a given body fluid compartment. The clinician emphasizes the diagnosis, clinical causes, and most appropriate treatment of acid-base disturbances. Historically, two different conceptual frameworks have evolved among clinicians and physiologists for interpreting acid-base phenomena.

40|$|The present {{review of}} fluid therapy studies using {{balanced}} solutions versus isotonic saline fluids (both crystalloids and colloids) aims to address recent controversy in this topic. The {{change to the}} acid–base equilibrium based on fluid selection is described. Key terms such as dilutional-hyperchloraemic acidosis (correctly used instead of dilutional acidosis or hyperchloraemic metabolic acidosis to account for both the <b>Henderson–Hasselbalch</b> and Stewart <b>equations),</b> isotonic saline and balanced solutions are defined. The review concludes that dilutional- hyperchloraemic acidosis is a side effect, mainly observed after the administration of large volumes of isotonic saline as a crystalloid. Its effect is moderate and relatively transient, and is minimised by limiting crystalloid administration {{through the use of}} colloids (in any carrier). Convincing evidence for clinically relevant adverse effects of dilutional-hyperchloraemic acidosis on renal function, coagulation, blood loss, the need for transfusion, gastrointestinal function or mortality cannot be found. In view of the long- term use of isotonic saline either as a crystalloid or as a colloid carrier, the paucity of data documenting detrimental effects of dilutional-hyperchloraemic acidosis and the limited published information on the effects of balanced solutions on outcome, we cannot currently recommend changing fluid therapy to the use of a balanced colloid preparation...|$|R
