40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} using simulation and optimization {{to maximize the}} throughput of an order-picking area is presented. The retrieval of pallets from a <b>high-bay</b> <b>warehouse</b> to the picking stations is formulated as an assignment problem and solved. To consider the dynamic effects of the materials handling system (conflicts, blocking), the optimal static assignment is validated with simulation. The obtained results are very promising. The throughput was significantly improved. Introduction Industrial material flow systems consist of several sources and destinations, connected by different kinds of materials handling systems such as conveyors, forklifts or automated guided vehicles (AGV). The demand of every station has to be satisfied (under the given capacity restrictions), work-in-process (WIP), sojourntime have to be minimized and throughput respectively maximized. To achieve this, typically non-mathematical approaches such as heuristics are implemented (Tompkins and White, 1984 [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Today, fo r {{the purpose}} of warehousing, {{companies}} {{are more and more}} building fully automated <b>high-bay</b> <b>warehouses.</b> In the thesis design and development of supervisory and control system is presented. Special attention was given to the user friendly user interface, which comprehends simple but informative graphical screens together with logging and notification of user in case of unusual events. For {{the purpose of}} intervention in the warehouse, a mobile panel was designed and developed in the same way. While developing the control system and all other connected information systems a need for a simulator of a stacker-crane was indicated in order to shorten the development cycle. The integration of simulator, running on a programmable logic controller in real time, requires only minimal changes of programming code on the programmable logic controller of the stacker-crane. ...|$|R

The grippers are formed as drawbars (2) which can be swivelled about rotating joints (1), having rotating rollers (8) at their picking ends for hooking into {{the handle of the}} storage container (7), whereby the swivel movement of the drawbar (2) is driven by a single linear drive (15) and a detent pawl (12) interacting with the linear drive (15) and the drawbar (2) is provided to change the pull-in/out movement of the drawbar (2). A friction belt drive (10) engaging laterally in the storage container (7) is arranged in the inner contour area of the load carrying device, the reaction force of the friction belt drive being taken up by pressure absorption devices (11) loca ted opposite...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} {{of information technology}} has also made {{its impact on the}} industrial networks, as the TCP/IP Ethernet bus communication is ever more frequently used for communicating between programmable logic controllers and high-level systems. In this thesis we have developed a program code that enables communication between the controller and the higher-level system on Ethernet bus. Our focus was on the controller side. To complete the task, it was necessary to determine the structure of the message - telegram, that you send between communication partners. Telegrams are build of two parts, control and data. Key for the system smooth functioning is that the telegrams are not lost during communication path. The program code was developed for different types of hardware, we used two Siemens controllers, controller Simatic S 7 - 300 and Simotion D 425. We also used the module CP 343 - 1 Lean which is an expansion module for the controller S 7 - 300. The program code was developed for use in automated <b>high-bay</b> <b>warehouse</b> for communication between crane controllers and higer-level systems. ...|$|E
40|$|In modern storing {{technology}} High-Bay Warehouses are {{of great}} importance due to their large capacity by combining relatively small floor area with random access on all units, a large band-width with respect to weight and measurement of the storage good and the simplicity of integration in the logistical peripheries. The storage and retrieval operations are usually performed by automated rail-bound storage at retrieval machines, or types of manual floor-travelling fork-lifts for High-Bay Warehouses. Particularly by automated <b>high-bay</b> <b>warehouse</b> systems, {{a high degree of}} positioning accuracy is a basic requirement for sufficient reliability. The aim of this work is to investigate the essential elements required for improving the positional accuracy with reference to the various influential parameters. The influential parameters are wearout, tolerance, static and dynamic deformation of the storage and retrieval machine, as well as the tolerance and static deformations of the rack structure or travel and guide rails. Another basic parameter is the positional aberation at the centring location. To study the qualities of positioning systems, an experimental model was conceived and constructed allowing the emulation of the vibration of the wing unit of storage and retrieval machines. Theoretical calculations as well as the experimental results show that both the vibration level of the column of signle mast machines and the vertical vibrations of the lifting carriage can be simulated with adequate precision. Various arrangements of positioning systems were compared with respect to the expected qualities. One arrangement based upon a laser positional transducer was chosen, built, and investigated {{with the help of the}} developed experimental model. A high positioning accuracy of this positioning system was verified-which was almost independent of all the enumerated influential parameters. (orig.)

40|$|In {{addition}} to the warehouse strategy and availability, the cycle times of the shelf storage and retrieval machines is a factor influencing the throughput of a <b>high-bay</b> <b>warehouse.</b> However, driving storage and retrieval machines can cause substantial mast vibration. This can have an adverse effect on stress, the positioning operation and warehouse cycle times. To increase capacity and reduce dynamic stress, it is therefore important {{to be able to}} drive storage and retrieval machines {{in such a way that}} unwanted vibrations can either be avoided or corrected. The studies relating to the travel drive control are based on the elastokinetic model of the two-mass oscillator. The dual-mass model simulates the vibration behaviour of the shelf storage and retrieval machine very closely and is ideal for examining the coefficient of oscillation which characterizes vibration. In {{addition to}} the initial mast vibration conditions, the given acceleration characteristic and the control unit used are the only other factors which can influence the coefficient of oscillation to be minimized. The results of a parameter study show that the current state-of-the-art cascade control is incapable of damping mast vibration. However, tests have shown that vibration behaviour can be improved considerably by using state control and fuzzy control. These active vibration damping measures make it possible to position the shelf storage and retrieval machine and simultaneously control vibration. Vibrations induced by changing rates of acceleration while the shelf storage and retrieval machine is traveling are correct immediately, thereby reducing dynamic stress. A comparison of the controls discussed shows that the state control best meets the existing requirements by virtue of its closed-loop control dynamics. (orig.)

Each of these load suspension devices bears a crossover conveyor mounted on the rigid platform or a rigid frame (16); each crossover conveyor can be adjusted over the entire length and beyond the end of the platform or frame. This crossover conveyor is designed as a carriage (23) which runs in guides (24 a, 24 b) of the platform or frame. A linear drive arranged on the platform of the frame (16) acts on the carriage.
