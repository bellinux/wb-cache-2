5|$|Because {{the names}} of the eight players had been kept secret, the general public was not {{informed}} that Bruce Smith, who had developed into one of the best defensive players in the country, {{would not be able to}} participate in the 1984 Independence Bowl. Only when Smith filed suit to force Virginia Tech and the NCAA to allow him to play in the game was the situation revealed. Dr. Cecil Lloyd, chairman of the Independence Bowl, announced at the time of the lawsuit that had he known about the restrictions on Smith, he likely would not <b>have</b> <b>invited</b> Tech to play in the game.|$|E
5|$|Described in the chronicles as a rash and temperamental man, Carrouges {{was also}} a fierce and brave warrior whose death in battle came after a forty-year {{military}} career in which he served in Normandy, Scotland and Hungary with distinction and success. He was also heavily involved in court politics, initially at {{the seat of his}} overlord Count Pierre of Alençon at Argentan, but later in the politics of the Royal household at Paris, to which he was attached as a chevalier d'honneur and Royal bodyguard in the years following the judicial duel. During his life he conducted a long trail of legal and financial dealings which infuriated his contemporaries and may <b>have</b> <b>invited</b> violence against himself and his family. The truth of the events which led him into public mortal combat in the Paris suburbs may never be known, but the legend is still debated and discussed 600 years later.|$|E
5|$|Dunstanburgh Castle is a 14th-century {{fortification}} on {{the coast}} of Northumberland in northern England, between the villages of Craster and Embleton. The castle was built by Earl Thomas of Lancaster between 1313 and 1322, taking advantage of the site's natural defences and the existing earthworks of an Iron Age fort. Thomas was a leader of a baronial faction opposed to King Edward II, and probably intended Dunstanburgh to act as a secure refuge, should the political situation in southern England deteriorate. The castle also served as a statement of the earl's wealth and influence, and would <b>have</b> <b>invited</b> comparisons with the neighbouring royal castle of Bamburgh. Thomas probably only visited his new castle once, before being captured at the Battle of Boroughbridge as he attempted to flee royal forces for the safety of Dunstanburgh. Thomas was executed, and the castle became the property of the Crown before passing into the Duchy of Lancaster.|$|E

25|$|Lange {{was called}} to the Wannsee Conference by Heydrich in January 1942. Lange (an SS major) was the lowest-ranking officer present. Heydrich viewed Lange's {{first-hand}} experience in conducting the mass murder of deported Jews as valuable for the conference. Instead of Lange, Heydrich could <b>have</b> <b>invited</b> either Karl Jäger or Erich Ehrlinger, who commanded the SiPo and SD in Lithuania and Belarus respectively, and were responsible for similar massacres. He chose Lange because Riga was the main deportation destination, and because Lange's doctorate made him seem more intellectual {{than the other two}} men. Lange's superior, Franz Walter Stahlecker, was not invited, as he was not familiar with the realities of the Jewish deportations and was not located in Riga.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} Pathan colonies in the Doab are that of Aliganj and Kasganj, both in Etah District. These Pathans belong {{mainly to the}} Lodi tribe, {{but there are also}} important settlements of Ghoris, Mohammadzais and Yousafzais. Both the settlements of Aliganj and Kasganj were founded by a Yaqut Khan. Yaqut Khan is said to <b>have</b> <b>invited</b> Pathans to settle in these two towns. A further settlement was founded at Kadirganj and Sajawar. Most of the early settlers belonged to the Lodi tribe, who still form the largest sub-group. In addition to these settlements, Bhai Khan from Toya khel who links to the Bangash tribe, a courtier of the Bangash Nawab of Farrukhabad founded the village of Sarai Aghat, which still remains a settlement of Danish khan Pathan.|$|E

25|$|The Allied {{plan was}} to anchor in the free water inside the crescent. Codrington's {{squadron}} would take up position facing {{the centre of the}} Ottoman line; the French and Russian squadrons would face the Ottoman left and right wings respectively. The French position in the line had been specifically determined so that they would face the Egyptian fleet, which had been trained by the French and might be reluctant to fight against Egypt's closest European ally. In conventional naval doctrine, Codrington's plan would have been regarded as an unacceptable risk, as it would <b>have</b> <b>invited</b> the enemy to try to surround the Allies. Furthermore, with the prevailing wind blowing from the SW, straight up the entrance, Codrington risked becoming trapped, unable to extricate his squadrons quickly if necessary. The adoption of this high-risk plan shows the total confidence of the Allied commanders in the tactical superiority of their vessels.|$|E
25|$|In May 1719, The 1st Duke of Newcastle, the Lord Chamberlain, ordered Handel to {{look for}} new singers. Handel {{travelled}} to Dresden to attend the newly built opera. He saw Teofane by Antonio Lotti, and engaged members of the cast for the Royal Academy of Music, founded {{by a group of}} aristocrats to assure themselves a constant supply of baroque opera or opera seria. Handel may <b>have</b> <b>invited</b> John Smith, his fellow student in Halle, and his son Johann Christoph Schmidt, to become his secretary and amanuensis. By 1723 he had moved into a Georgian house at 25 Brook Street, which he rented {{for the rest of his}} life. This house, where he rehearsed, copied music and sold tickets, is now the Handel House Museum. During twelve months between 1724 and 1725, Handel wrote three outstanding and successful operas, Giulio Cesare, Tamerlano and Rodelinda. Handel's operas are filled with da capo arias, such as Svegliatevi nel core. After composing Silete venti, he concentrated on opera and stopped writing cantatas. Scipio, from which the regimental slow march of the British Grenadier Guards is derived, was performed as a stopgap, waiting for the arrival of Faustina Bordoni.|$|E

500|$|Harrison {{wrote and}} {{recorded}} [...] "Don't Let Me Wait Too Long" [...] {{during a period}} marked by his heightened devotion to Hindu spirituality, which coincided with marital problems with his first wife, Pattie Boyd, and the financial complications affecting his Bangladesh aid project. The track is an upbeat love song {{in the tradition of}} early 1960s Brill Building songwriters. Its lyrics <b>have</b> <b>invited</b> debate among commentators as to whether Harrison is addressing a lover such as Boyd or, like the majority of his lyrics on Material World, God.|$|E
500|$|Harrison wrote [...] "If I Needed Someone" [...] as a {{love song}} to Pattie Boyd, the English model whom he married in January 1966. The lyrics convey an {{ambivalent}} tone, however, and <b>have</b> <b>invited</b> interpretation as a message to a casual love interest. Harrison based the song's guitar riff on that used by Roger McGuinn in the Byrds' adaptation of [...] "The Bells of Rhymney". Following its inclusion in the set list for the Beatles' 1965 UK tour, the song became the only Harrison composition performed live by the group during their years of international fame.|$|E

500|$|Sources {{for events}} after this date are {{extremely}} scarce, but a tradition, reported {{as early as}} the mid-6th century by a British priest named Gildas, records that the British sent for help against the barbarians to Aetius, a Roman consul, probably in the late 440s. No help came. Subsequently, a British leader named Vortigern is supposed to <b>have</b> <b>invited</b> continental mercenaries to help fight the Picts who were attacking from the north. The leaders, whose names are recorded as Hengest and Horsa, rebelled, and a long period of warfare ensued. [...] The invaders—Angles, Saxons, Jutes, and Frisians—gained control of parts of England, but lost a major battle at Mons Badonicus (the location of which is not known). [...] Some authors have speculated that Ælle may have led the Saxon forces at this battle, while others reject the idea out of hand.|$|E

After announcing this to Bart and Lisa, he reclaims his [...] "fun dad" [...] title, leaving Marge worried about losing her new bond with the children. In one of her dreams that night, she and the children are trying out new food together with chef Anthony Bourdain when Homer jumps in on a hop ball and eats up everything, taking away the children's attention from Marge. Homer, Bart, Lisa, Bourdain, and other famous chefs that have shown up, such as Mario Batali, then jump away from Marge on hop balls, leaving her by herself. Afterwards, Gordon Ramsay appears next to her, using profanity while telling her that she should not <b>have</b> <b>invited</b> Homer.
