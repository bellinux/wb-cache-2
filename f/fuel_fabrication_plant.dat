Using the Westinghouse Recycle Fuels Plant as representative of future mixed-oxide <b>fuel</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants,</b> critical structures and equipment (systems, components, and piping/ducting) were identified. These included the manufacturing building and 11 different pieces of equipment.

Because critical equipment analysis and test methods generally use floor-response spectra as their seismic input loading, several methods used to generate floor spectra were also examined. These include the time-history approach and the Kapur and Biggs approximate methods. The examination included the effect of site characteristics and both horizontal and vertical structural response.

40|$|Abstract—Effectively {{implementing}} safeguards in {{fuel reprocessing}} and <b>fuel</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants</b> requires the {{extensive use of}} state-of-the-art instrumentation for accurate material characterization.

Multiple detection technologies are implemented that provide the necessary Continuity of Knowledge (CoK) and inventory control required for effective safeguards. In a Pu/U-oxide (MOX) fuel processing facility, much of the detection technology is based on moderated 3 He neutron detectors. Recent concerns with respect to the possible lack of sufficient quantities of 3 He has resulted in the interest in developing alternative detection technologies for current and future needs and applications.

To improve the quality control in nuclear <b>fuel</b> <b>fabrication</b> <b>plants,</b> an automated pellet inspection system based on advanced techniques is needed. Such a system addresses the following concerns of the current manual inspection method: (1) the reliability of inspection due to typical human errors, (2) radiation exposure to the workers, and (3) speed of inspection and its economical impact.
