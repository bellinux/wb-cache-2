5|$|The Americans stopped sharing any {{information}} on heavy water production, the method of electromagnetic separation, the physical or chemical properties of plutonium, the details of bomb design, or the facts about <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> reactions. This was a major disappointment which hindered the British and the Canadians, who were collaborating on heavy water production and several {{other aspects of the}} research programme. By 1943 Britain had stopped sending its scientists to the United States, which slowed down the pace of work there, which had relied on efforts led by British scientists. In March 1943 Conant approached the Military Policy Committee, which decided that Britain's help would benefit some areas of the project. Chadwick, Penney, Peierls, Oliphant and other British scientists were important enough that the bomb design team at the Los Alamos Laboratory needed them, despite the risk of revealing weapon design secrets.|$|E
5|$|Compton asked {{theoretical}} physicist J. Robert Oppenheimer of the University of California, Berkeley, to {{take over}} research into <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> calculations—the key to calculations of critical mass and weapon detonation—from Gregory Breit, who had quit on 18 May 1942 because of concerns over lax operational security. John H. Manley, a physicist at the Metallurgical Laboratory, was assigned to assist Oppenheimer by contacting and coordinating experimental physics groups scattered across the country. Oppenheimer and Robert Serber of the University of Illinois examined the problems of neutron diffusion—how neutrons moved in a nuclear chain reaction—and hydrodynamics—how the explosion produced by a chain reaction might behave. To review this work and {{the general theory of}} fission reactions, Oppenheimer and Fermi convened meetings at the University of Chicago in June and at the University of California, Berkeley, in July 1942 with theoretical physicists Hans Bethe, John Van Vleck, Edward Teller, Emil Konopinski, Robert Serber, Stan Frankel, and Eldred C. Nelson, the latter three former students of Oppenheimer, and experimental physicists Emilio Segrè, Felix Bloch, Franco Rasetti, John Henry Manley, and Edwin McMillan. They tentatively confirmed that a fission bomb was theoretically possible.|$|E
5|$|Each fusion {{event in}} the D-T fusion reactor gives off an alpha {{particle}} and a <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> with around 14MeV of kinetic energy. This is enough energy to cause fission in U-238, and many other transuranic elements as well. This reaction is used in H-bombs to increase the yield of the fusion section by wrapping it in a layer of depleted uranium, which undergoes rapid fission when hit by the neutrons from the fusion bomb inside. The same basic concept {{can also be used}} with a fusion reactor like LIFE, using its neutrons to cause fission in a blanket of fission fuel. Unlike a fission reactor, which burns out its fuel once the U-235 drops below a certain threshold value, these fission–fusion hybrid reactors can continue producing power from the fission fuel as long as the fusion reactor continues to provide neutrons. As the neutrons have high energy, they can potentially cause multiple fission events, leading to the reactor as a whole producing more energy, a concept known as energy multiplication. Even leftover nuclear fuel taken from conventional nuclear reactors will burn in this fashion. This is potentially attractive because this burns off many of the long lived radioisotopes in the process, producing waste that is only mildly radioactive and lacking most long-lived components.|$|E

Cells were exposed to X rays or to <b>fast</b> <b>neutrons</b> at doses ranging from 0. 5 to 8 Gy. Apoptosis was determined by measurements of the sub-G(0) /G(1) -phase DNA content and by the externalization of phosphatidylserine. <b>Fast</b> <b>neutrons</b> induced extensive apoptosis in TK 6 cells, {{as shown by the}} formation of hypodiploid particles, the externalization of phosphatidylserine, and the activation of caspases. In contrast, cell death was triggered at a significantly lower rate in cells lacking functional TP 53. However, TP 53 -independent cell death also expressed the morphological and biochemical hallmarks of apoptosis. Proliferation tests and clonogenic assays showed that <b>fast</b> <b>neutrons</b> can nevertheless kill WTK 1 and NH 32 cells efficiently. The absence of functional TP 53 only delays radiation-induced cell death, which is also mediated by caspases. These results indicate that fast-neutron irradiation activates two pathways to apoptosis and that the greater relative biological effectiveness of <b>fast</b> <b>neutrons</b> reflects mainly an increase in clonogenic cell death.

25|$|The second easiest {{reaction}} is to fuse deuterium with itself. Because of its low cost, deuterium {{is commonly used}} by Fusor amateurs. Bussard's polywell experiments were performed using this fuel. Fusion of deuterium or tritium produces a <b>fast</b> <b>neutron,</b> and therefore produces radioactive waste. Bussard's choice was to fuse boron-11 with protons; this {{reaction is}} aneutronic (does not produce neutrons). An advantage of p-11B as a fusion fuel is that the primary reactor output would be energetic alpha particles, which can be directly converted to electricity at high efficiency using direct energy conversion. Direct conversion has achieved a 48% power efficiency against 80–90% theoretical efficiency.|$|E

25|$|Some transuranium {{elements}} such as plutonium, neptunium and americium can form volatile fluorides, but these compounds are not stable when the fluorine partial pressure is decreased.

25|$|One design {{weakness}} of the two-fluid design is the necessity for a barrier wall between the core and the blanket region, a wall {{that would have to}} be replaced periodically because of <b>fast</b> <b>neutron</b> damage. Graphite was the material chosen by ORNL because of its low neutron absorption, compatibility with the molten salts, high temperature resistance, and sufficient strength and integrity to separate the fuel and blanket salts. The effect of neutron radiation on graphite is to slowly shrink and then swell the graphite to cause an increase in porosity and a deterioration in physical properties. Graphite pipes would change length, and may crack and leak. ORNL chose not to pursue the two-fluid design, and no examples of the two-fluid reactor were ever constructed.|$|E
25|$|<b>Fast</b> <b>neutron</b> {{reactors}} use fast neutrons {{to cause}} fission in their fuel. They {{do not have}} a neutron moderator, and use less-moderating coolants. Maintaining a chain reaction requires the fuel to be more highly enriched in fissile material (about 20% or more) due to the relatively lower probability of fission versus capture by U-238. Fast reactors have the potential to produce less transuranic waste because all actinides are fissionable with fast neutrons, but they are more difficult to build and more expensive to operate. Overall, fast reactors are less common than thermal reactors in most applications. Some early power stations were fast reactors, as are some Russian naval propulsion units. Construction of prototypes is continuing (see fast breeder or generation IV reactors).|$|E

25|$|Typical fission events release {{about two}} hundred million eV (200MeV) of energy for each fission event. The exact isotope which is fissioned, {{and whether or not}} it is {{fissionable}} or fissile, has only a small impact on the amount of energy released. This can be easily seen by examining the curve of binding energy (image below), and noting that the average binding energy of the actinide nuclides beginning with uranium is around 7.6 MeV per nucleon. Looking further left on the curve of binding energy, where the fission products cluster, it is easily observed that the binding energy of the fission products tends to center around 8.5 MeV per nucleon. Thus, in any fission event of an isotope in the actinide's range of mass, roughly 0.9 MeV is released per nucleon of the starting element. The fission of U235 by a slow neutron yields nearly identical energy to the fission of U238 by a <b>fast</b> <b>neutron.</b> This energy release profile holds true for thorium and the various minor actinides as well.|$|E
