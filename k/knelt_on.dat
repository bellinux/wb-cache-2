5|$|Milan Pořádek, the fan whom Blythe {{admitted}} to shoving off the stage, testified {{on the third}} day of the trial. Pořádek said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage. Pořádek testified that Blythe knocked him down, <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe definitely did not choke him. He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he (Pořádek) was drunk and the way he acted, Blythe's reaction was adequate. He commented that he grasped {{the fact that he was}} not wanted on stage.|$|E
5|$|Tennessee had {{one final}} {{opportunity}} to score after receiving Virginia Tech's kickoff with 2:38 remaining. Jonathan Crompton threw several passes downfield, completing throws of 9, 9, 8, and 26 yards, advancing the Volunteers {{toward the end}} zone. Inside the Virginia Tech red zone, however, the Volunteers found less success. They committed a false start penalty, advanced the ball with a five-yard run, then Crompton threw two incomplete passes. On fourth down, Crompton was sacked for a 14-yard loss, the Volunteers' final play of the game. Virginia Tech <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> the ball to run the final seconds off the clock and clinch the 37-14 victory.|$|E
5|$|Blythe, who is nearsighted, {{took off}} his glasses before {{entering}} the stage, which together with the smoke and light effects allegedly left him half-blind. Blythe said that people could easily reach the band members or climb up to the stage. One of the fans, who was identified as Milan Pořádek by Czech newspapers, and who was scheduled to testify later during the proceedings, managed to climb the stage twice without being stopped by security. Blythe testified that during the first attempt, Pořádek rushed the stage and started waving his arms before stage diving. The second time, he tried to {{put his arms around}} Blythe in an attempt to hug him. Blythe, who according to his own words perceived this as a danger, caught Pořádek's collar, pushed him on the ground, <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> him and repeatedly told him to stop. He then led the fan by his hair {{to the edge of the}} stage, where the fan jumped off. It was only after watching a video of the incident that Blythe found out that a security officer was actually pushing the fan from back. Blythe further said that he saw Pořádek trying to reach the stage yet again before finally being stopped by security.|$|E

60|$|To this O'Brien agreed. A {{handkerchief}} {{was tied}} over his eyes, blindfolding him, and he <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> the deck {{with his back}} to Sullivan.|$|R
25|$|Security {{cordoned off}} the east {{entrance}} to the Great Hall, but several students pressed forward. Three of these students <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> {{the steps of the}} Great Hall to present a petition and demanded to see Premier Li Peng. However, no leaders emerged from the Great Hall, leaving the students disappointed and angry; some called for a class boycott.|$|E
25|$|The Giants wasted {{several seconds}} in the huddle in dismay over the play-calling. At the line, Clack saw the play clock winding down and {{took it upon himself}} to snap it with 31 seconds left in the game to avoid a delay-of-game penalty, which would have stopped the clock and cost the Giants five yards. Had the Giants <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> the {{subsequent}} play, there still would have been one second left on the game clock once the play clock ran down, requiring a fourth-down play to be run (the play clock at the time ran for 30 seconds; it now runs for 40).|$|E
500|$|After Bowie married Iman in {{a private}} {{ceremony}} in 1992, he said they knew that their [...] "real marriage, sanctified by God, had to happen in a church in Florence". Earlier that year, he <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> stage at The Freddie Mercury Tribute Concert and recited the Lord's Prayer before a television audience of up to one billion people. In 1993, Bowie said he had an [...] "undying" [...] belief in the [...] "unquestionable" [...] existence of God. Interviewed in 2005, Bowie said whether God exists [...] "is not a question that can be answered.... I'm not quite an atheist and it worries me. There's that little bit that holds on: 'Well, I'm almost an atheist. Give {{me a couple of}} months.... I've nearly got it right. In his will, Bowie stipulated that he be cremated and his ashes scattered in Bali [...] "in accordance with the Buddhist rituals".|$|E

500|$|On February 4, 1999, Christopher Drayton and Clifton Brown, Jr. were {{traveling}} on a Greyhound bus bound for Detroit, Michigan. When the bus made a planned stop in Tallahassee, Florida, passengers {{were told to}} get off the bus so it could be cleaned and refueled. After the passengers re-boarded, the driver allowed Officers Blackburn, Hoover, and Lang of the Tallahassee Police Department to enter the bus [...] "as part of a routine drug and weapons interdiction effort". Although the officers displayed visible badges, they carried concealed weapons and were not in uniform. Upon entering the bus, Officer Hoover <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> the driver's seat, Officer Blackburn stood {{at the back of the}} bus, and Officer Lang walked along the aisle of the bus to talk to passengers. He asked passengers which luggage was theirs and where they were going. None of the officers blocked the aisle or otherwise obstructed the exit, and passengers were free to leave while the officers conducted their investigation. However, the officers did not inform passengers of their right to refuse to cooperate with the investigation.|$|E
500|$|Madonna {{performed}} [...] "Oh Father" [...] on her 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour with [...] "Live to Tell", {{during the}} second segment of the show. As the performance of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] ended, Madonna, who {{was dressed in a}} clergyman's robe with a crucifix around her neck, and a veil around her head, <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> a church nave, while incense fumes wafted around her. She started singing [...] "Live to Tell" [...] from a confession bench, with Roman columns and a platform full of votive candles in the background. In the middle of the song, she started singing [...] "Oh Father" [...] while a dancer in a black frock played the role of a priest. The dancer, Carlton Wilborn, recalled that this performance required a lot of rehearsal time, since the dance portrayed Madonna as a woman trying to find her religion. He explained: [...] "One side knew she needed it, another side was resistant, and our dance represented that battle inside." [...] At the end of the performance, Wilborn pushed down Madonna's head before pulling her back up again, thus portraying his role as the priest, trying to wake up Madonna to the importance of religion. Two different performances were taped and released on video, the Blond Ambition – Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and the Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990.|$|E
2500|$|While {{dozens of}} people from the stopped train shouted and cursed at officers, Mehserle and Pirone {{positioned}} Grant face-down. [...] According to Pirone, Grant was disobeying instructions and cursing at officers. [...] Witnesses said that Grant pleaded with BART police not to shock him with a Taser. [...] Pirone <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> Grant's neck and told him that he was under arrest for resisting an officer.|$|E

60|$|The great {{door was}} flung open. He entered,--the same tall warrior, slim, and beautiful, blazing in shining steel. He {{approached}} the Prince's throne, supported {{on each side}} by a friend likewise in armor. He <b>knelt</b> gracefully <b>on</b> one knee.|$|R
60|$|Tom Brixton {{took that}} step at once. He <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> a mossy bank, and there, with the glorious {{prospect}} of the beautiful wilderness before him, and the setting sun irradiating his still haggard countenance, held communion with God.|$|R
2500|$|Both {{government}} representatives and the Chilean public have repeatedly credited Divine Providence with keeping the miners alive while the Chilean public viewed their subsequent rescue as a miracle. Chile's president Sebastián Piñera stated, [...] "When the first miner emerges safe and sound, I hope all the bells {{of all the}} churches of Chile ring out forcefully, with joy and hope. Faith has moved mountains." [...] When Esteban Rojas {{stepped out of the}} rescue capsule, he immediately <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> the ground with his hands together in prayer then raised his arms above him in adoration. His wife then wrapped a tapestry bearing the image of The Virgin Mary around him as they hugged and cried.|$|E
2500|$|On June 5 the Rays were {{involved}} in a benches clearing brawl at Fenway Park with the Boston Red Sox following a series of events leading up from the previous night's game. In the previous game, Red Sox Center Fielder Coco Crisp attempted to steal 2nd Base, and slid into the base head first. Rays Shortstop Jason Bartlett who was covering the base on the play, <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> his left knee while attempting to catch the throw from Catcher Dioner Navarro, which blocked the base and caused Crisp to make contact with Bartlett's leg, jamming Crisp's thumb. Crisp was safe on the play. Crisp stated that Bartlett's actions were [...] "not something you do. You can do that, but that's shady. And he's not a bad dude, but that was shady. If you going to hurt me, I'm gonna come back and hurt you." ...|$|E
2500|$|The couple {{decided to}} leave Britain for Australia. There were complications; having married Balawaider, Florance had {{acquired}} Polish nationality and was classified as an alien. Balawaider had war service credentials {{and was able to}} fly ahead to Australia, but Florance had to deal with official obstacles before she and the three children could embark on the Aberdeen & Commonwealth Line vessel [...] "Esperance Bay" [...] on 6 March 1948. On arrival in Fremantle, Peter Oyston recalls that his mother [...] "ran down the gangplank ahead of everyone else and against the orders of the Captain or the crew, and <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> the soil in the port, and then grabbed a handful of gravel and started eating it, and saying, 'Oh, Australia, Australia, I'm home, I'm home. My lovely country'" [...] Florance was soon reunited with her husband and the family moved into a run-down wooden cottage in Prahan, a suburb of Melbourne.|$|E

2500|$|As {{the third}} track on the album, [...] "Baby's in Black" [...] conveys the same sad and resentful outlook {{of the two}} {{preceding}} songs. Music critic Richie Unterberger views it as [...] "a love lament for a grieving girl that was perhaps more morose than any previous Beatles song". It was the first song recorded for the album and features a two-part harmony sung by Lennon and McCartney. McCartney recalled: [...] "'Baby's in Black' we did because we liked waltz-time... And I think also John and I {{wanted to do something}} bluesy, a bit darker, more grown-up, rather than just straight pop." [...] Beatles historian Mark Lewisohn cites the band's dedication to achieving a discordant twanging sound for Harrison's lead guitar part, and Martin's objection to the song opening with this sound, {{as an example of the}} Beatles breaking free of their producer's control for the first time. To achieve the desired swelling effect, Lennon <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> the studio floor and altered the volume control on Harrison's Gretsch as he played.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tactics of}} the Fulani were {{continually}} refined over time, as they gained more victories and themselves began to acquire numbers of horses for their own cavalry arm. Dan Fodio wrote on tactics employed by his forces as the jihad campaign unfolded: The infantry armed themselves with large shields (diraq) and carried long lances and javelin. Grouped into ranks, a spearman <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> the left knee, holding his round shield before him. Behind the ranks of spearmen the archers stood ready. They were ordered to shoot at the enemy horse and men in chain mail (duru). As the enemy cavalry approached the infantry would launch its javelins and the archers would keep shooting. If the enemy wavered, the infantry formation would then part left and right, so that their own cavalry was unleashed in pursuit. The writings of Dan Fodio on tactics echo a sentiment that would be approved by many a military commander: [...] "Concentration {{is the first thing}} in victory: the beginning of defeat is dispersion." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nguyễn Công Minh, {{daughter}} of the Deputy Mayor of Huế at the time, reported that her father, who was of old age, was arrested {{at his home in}} the beginning of the Communist occupation, 3 days after he ordered his children (incl. Nguyễn Công Minh) and wife to flee via the back of their house when Communist troops first came knocking at their home. Upon telling the troops that he was Deputy Mayor of Huế who was set to retire in one year (1969), he was ordered to report to a camp for reeducation, and pack clothing and food sufficient for 10 days. He was never seen again, nor were his remains recovered. [...] She recalled that in the search of her father's remains, she witnessed that many of the bodies she came across in the mass graves were found to be in a fetal position, with their hands tied behind their backs, and the back of the heads/skulls were smashed, indicating that they <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> the ground prior to their deaths and they died due to blunt-force trauma to their heads.|$|E
6000|$|But {{her brother}} had passed in between them and her, [...] And calmly <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> the high-altar stair-- [...] Of an infantine aspect so stern to the view [...] That the priest could not smile on the child's eyes of blue [...] As he would for another.|$|R
60|$|Gabriel {{took the}} torch with {{trembling}} fingers and <b>knelt</b> down <b>on</b> {{the floor to}} examine it closely.

5000|$|A true eccentric, Schmidt {{compared}} {{himself to}} Rip Van Winkle, Paul Bunyan, Robin Hood, and Baron Munchausen; [...] "I became some {{greater part of}} this mountain up here.

2500|$|Empress Dowager Longyu {{endorsed}} the [...] "Imperial Edict of the Abdication of the Qing Emperor" [...] (清帝退位詔書) on 12 February 1912 under a deal brokered by Prime Minister Yuan Shikai (a {{general of the}} Beiyang Army) with the imperial court in Beijing and the Republicans in southern China. At the crucial meeting in the Forbidden City, Puyi watched the meeting between Longyu and Yuan, which he remembered as: [...] "The Dowager Empress {{was sitting on a}} kang [...] in a side room of the Mind Nature Palace, wiping her eyes with a handkerchief while a fat old man [...] <b>knelt</b> <b>on</b> a red cushion before her, tears rolling down his face. I was sitting {{to the right of the}} Dowager and wondering why the two adults were crying. There was nobody in the room besides us three and it was very quiet; the fat man was sniffing while he talked and I could not understand what he was saying ... This was the occasion Yuan directly brought up the question of abdication". Under the [...] "Articles of Favourable Treatment of the Great Qing Emperor after His Abdication" [...] (清帝退位 優待條件), signed with the new Republic of China, Puyi was to retain his imperial title and be treated by the government of the Republic with the protocol attached to a foreign monarch. This was similar to Italy's Law of Guarantees (1870) which accorded the Pope certain honors and privileges similar to those enjoyed by the King of Italy. Puyi and the imperial court were allowed to remain in the northern half of the Forbidden City (the Private Apartments) as well as in the Summer Palace. A hefty annual subsidy of four million silver taels was granted by the Republic to the imperial household, although it was never fully paid and was abolished after just a few years. Puyi himself was not informed in February 1912 that his reign had ended and China was now a republic and continued to believe that he was the still the Emperor for sometime afterwards. In 1913, when the Empress Dowager Longyu died, President Yuan Shikai arrived at the Forbidden City to pay his respects, which Puyi's tutors told him meant that major changes were afloat.|$|E
