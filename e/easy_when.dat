The family struggles {{to make ends meet}} and things aren't <b>easy</b> <b>when</b> their father, Bill {{abandons}} them. Jill must work alongside her mother to help put her brothers through college. She works as a manicurist and also has aspirations of being a model. In 2003, Jill's birth certificate confirmed the year of her birth as 1957.|$|E
5|$|Peart {{got a job}} in Lakeside Park, in Port Dalhousie on {{the shores}} of Lake Ontario, which later {{inspired}} a song of the same name on the Rush album Caress of Steel. He worked on the Bubble Game and Ball Toss, but his tendency to take it <b>easy</b> <b>when</b> business was slack resulted in his termination. By his late teens, Peart had played in local bands such as Mumblin’ Sumpthin’, the Majority, and JR Flood. These bands practiced in basement recreation rooms and garages and played church halls, high schools and roller rinks in towns across Southern Ontario such as Mitchell, Seaforth, and Elmira. They also played in the northern Ontario city of Timmins. Tuesday nights were filled with jam sessions at the Niagara Theatre Centre.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Bay {{generally}} {{stands between}} , and is always bay in colour. Bright bay horses (bays {{with a more}} reddish tint than normal) are the most preferred by breeders, followed by ordinary bay, dark bay and then light bay. This preference for brighter shades of bay was originally stated in the official breed standard, although this stipulation has since been removed. In some bloodlines of the breed, light, grayish hairs in the mane and tail are known as a characteristic of pure blood. White markings, except for a small star on the forehead, render the horse inadmissible to the stud book. Horses {{are expected to have}} complete black points, including completely black lower legs. Legs that are red below the knees and hocks are considered faulty in colour, although they do not disqualify a horse from registry. The occasional red legs that appear in the breed are thought to come from chestnut Thoroughbred stallions that were crossed into Cleveland Bay and Yorkshire Coach Horse bloodlines at some points in the history of both breeds. The uniformity in colour is encouraged as it makes creating matching driving teams and pairs very <b>easy.</b> <b>When</b> the breed was first developed, the horses almost always had a countershaded dorsal stripe, but these disappeared with the outcrossings of the 18th century.|$|E

25|$|Diagnosis is {{relatively}} <b>easy</b> <b>when</b> all {{the symptoms of}} narcolepsy are present, but if the sleep attacks are isolated and cataplexy is mild or absent, diagnosis is more difficult. It is also possible for cataplexy to occur in isolation. Three tests that are commonly used in diagnosing narcolepsy are the polysomnogram, the multiple sleep latency test (MSLT), and administration of the Epworth Sleepiness Scale. These tests are usually performed by a sleep specialist. The polysomnogram involves continuous recording of sleep brain waves {{and a number of}} nerve and muscle functions during night time sleep. When tested, people with narcolepsy fall asleep rapidly, enter REM sleep early, and may often awaken during the night. The polysomnogram also helps to detect other possible sleep disorders that could cause daytime sleepiness.|$|E
500|$|All of {{the players}} were {{cooperative}} except for Jose Canseco, who was intimidating. He disliked his original part and insisted it be rewritten, and the writers grudgingly made him as heroic as possible. He was originally slated {{to wake up in}} bed with Edna Krabappel and miss the game, but Canseco's then-wife, Esther Haddad, objected. He disliked his caricature, stating that [...] "the animation looked nothing like ," [...] but that he found the acting was very <b>easy.</b> <b>When</b> asked in 2007 about his part by the San Jose Mercury News, he responded, [...] "that was 100 years ago," [...] {{hung up the phone and}} did not answer any of the paper's subsequent calls for an interview about his guest spot.|$|E

500|$|Following her {{appearance}} in the episode, Janssen was offered a five-year contract {{to appear in the}} main cast as Jadzia Dax on [...] but turned it down as {{she did not want to}} be tied to a long term series contract, and felt it would have made her lazy as an actor. The makeup worn by Janssen was used on the actress cast in that part, Terry Farrell, although without stencilling. This was as a result of Berman's rejection of the original Trill makeup from [...] "", with Kamala's makeup suggested as a replacement. At the time of an interview with Starlog magazine in 1993, Janssen said that she would be happy to return to The Next Generation to portray Kamala once again. She did not return to the series, but went on to appear as Jean Grey alongside Stewart in the 2000 film X-Men and subsequent films in the series. She found working with Stewart <b>easy</b> <b>when</b> they were reunited, because of their previous work on [...] "The Perfect Mate".|$|E
500|$|The stage used {{multimedia}} projection {{and technology}} conceived by Moment Factory and Cirque du Soleil. After Madonna's entrance, {{the ground and}} stage floor revealed animated Vogue magazine covers featuring the singer. The effect was achieved by projection mapping, which turns an object (often irregularly-shaped) into a surface for video projection. Although projection mapping {{had been used to}} introduce the Nokia Lumia and project images of NBA players on the Hudson River in 2011, it had never been used on such a large scale. Moment Factory partner and executive producer Eric Fournier said that since the studio had been associated with technology-dependent shows, preparing for and accommodating the requirements of the Super Bowl were <b>easy.</b> <b>When</b> Moment Factory began the halftime-show preparations, Madonna's team had already selected the songs, and the studio developed visual effects complementing the songs' choreography. According to Moment Factory creative director Sakchin Bessette, using video projections was the most efficient method for the visual effects, as this required moving less equipment to the field than other methods. Fournier said, [...] "It all came from the decision at the beginning to make a show out of it, not just a performance. Madonna's a perfectionist, and she wanted to do something extraordinary, so that was the objective of everybody." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Zito {{started off}} with a win against the Mariners. He went 6 innings and allowed an earned run, an RBI single by Olerud in the first inning. In his next start, Zito went 7 innings, struck out 7, walked 4, and allowed one run against Texas. In the process, he became only the fifth A's pitcher to win 10 {{straight}} games, the first since Welch in 1990. On April 18, Zito went nine innings, allowing six hits and no runs in a start against the Rangers. Zito improved to 9–0 in his career against Texas. After the game, Texas manager Buck Showalter said, [...] "I got the feeling he made it look pretty <b>easy.</b> <b>When</b> he {{has that kind of}} command, you can see what happens." [...] Zito struggled in his second-to last start before the All-Star Break on July 8. He allowed seven earned runs and 15 hits against the Devil Rays. The 15 hits allowed were a career high. Devil Rays manager Piniella was stunned by Zito's bad start. He said, [...] "If you'd have told me we'd get 15 hits off Zito in five or six innings, I would have looked at you a little funny." [...] Nevertheless, Zito bounced back in his next start. He went eight innings without surrendering a run against the Baltimore Orioles. Zito was again named to the All Star team, the second time he has been named to the team.|$|E

500|$|Critics commented {{positively}} on {{the development}} of Will and Emma's relationship; TV Guide Natalie Abrams wrote that she had been waiting for them to kiss since the pilot episode. Flandez felt that the kiss made the [...] "poignant moment" [...] of the glee club's final performance [...] "even more dear", and hoped {{that it would not be}} the last between them, while Aly Semigran of MTV praised the development and called the kiss [...] "sweet [...] longing". Goldman wrote: [...] "Schue and Emma finally coming together was very hard to not feel good about, even though you know it just won't be that <b>easy</b> <b>when</b> the show returns". Gerrick Kennedy of the Los Angeles Times opined that it was clear Ken and Emma would not marry, and added that when Will kissed Emma: [...] "I died". In discussing Will and Emma's conversation about how she would have left Ken if Will had shown any interest in her, Pardue commented: [...] "That's maybe the sweetest and the saddest thing I've ever heard." [...] She called the kiss between Will and Emma [...] "romantic" [...] commenting that it made her [...] "heart happy". Entertainment Weekly Dan Snierson commented that although there was satisfaction in the episode ending on the kiss, it may have been [...] "more intriguing" [...] to conclude with Will finding Emma's office empty, or [...] "before she smiled approvingly after their kiss", questioning whether it was too soon for the two of them to begin a relationship, or [...] "about freakin' time".|$|E
500|$|... "The Climb" [...] won [...] "Best Song from a Movie" [...] at the 2009 MTV Movie Awards and [...] "Music Choice: Single" [...] at the 2009 Teen Choice Awards. At the 52nd Grammy Awards, [...] "The Climb" [...] {{received}} a nomination for the Best Song Written for a Motion Picture, Television or Other Visual Media, a songwriter's award. However, Walt Disney Records withdrew the song from consideration because {{the song was}} not [...] "written specifically for a motion picture, television or other visual media", as the Grammy eligibility rules dictated. According to Rolling Stone magazine, [...] "The Climb" [...] was submitted for consideration by mistake. The National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences (NARAS), the presenters of the Grammy Awards, released a statement stating, [...] "Walt Disney Records was proactive and forthcoming to our awards department and verified that the song was not written specifically for the film Hannah Montana: The Movie. Based on this information, the Academy has complied with the label's request." [...] NARAS replaced the nomination with the song with the next highest initial vote count, [...] "All is Love", which was written by Karen O and Nick Zinner for the film Where the Wild Things Are. Dan Milliken of Country Universe gave the song a D+. His review consisted solely of two motivational posters: one reading [...] "Life: Its not about the destination, but the journey" [...] to describe the song's content, and a mock poster reading [...] "Success: Everything is <b>easy</b> <b>when</b> you're cute" [...] for his actual review. He later expanded his review, calling it [...] "a soulless rephrasing of an extremely famous philosophical message (so famous it borders on cliche) that doesn’t provide an emotionally coherent context or justification". Milliken gave the song a higher grade because [...] "she’s a pretty good singer for someone her age".|$|E

2500|$|Churchill {{wound up}} the debate for the government, {{defending}} {{the conduct of}} the Norwegian campaign with some robustness.

[...] "It is <b>easy</b> <b>when</b> you have no responsibility. If you dare, and forfeit is exacted, it is murder of our sailors; and if you are prudent, you are craven, cowardly, inept and timid". If nothing similarly bold had been done at Trondheim, it was not because it was thought too dangerous; but because it had been thought unnecessary: military advice had been against an opposed landing and instead predicted rapid success from the steps actually taken.|$|E
2500|$|The {{substitution}} of oil with other fossil fuels is theoretically relatively <b>easy</b> <b>when</b> static installations are concerned, {{as in the}} case for electricity generation. Reserves of coal are substantial, and the technology to use it is well established. Increasing the use of coal, however, would lead to higher carbon emissions which is likely to be politically unacceptable in many countries due to the implications of global warming, although carbon capture and storage may provide a solution. Natural gas is another alternative, and combined cycle power generation using natural gas is the cleanest source of power available using fossil fuels, producing about 30% less carbon dioxide than burning petroleum and about 45% less than burning coal. The major difficulty in the [...] use of natural gas is transportation and storage because of its low density. Natural gas pipelines are economical, but are impractical across oceans.|$|E
2500|$|A {{recurring}} optional boss enemy {{throughout the}} series is the legendary Ragu O Ragula, known as the [...] "King of the Monsters". He is strongly hinted at being an alien lifeform, as he has [...] "traveled the stars". In each Wild ARMs game, he is the ultimate extra boss. In games in which the Abyss — a sometimes ridiculously long optional dungeon that appears {{in many of the}} games — is present, he will be {{at the end of that}} dungeon. [...] The player is not often given many clues to find him, but he is always alluded to in a few bookshelves throughout the game. [...] When defeated, Ragu usually bestows upon the player the iconic Sheriff Star accessory, which not only proves the player's valor, but also tends to make the remainder of the game quite <b>easy</b> <b>when</b> equipped due to its effects. This trend was broken in Wild Arms 5, in which when defeated, Ragu drops a badge called [...] "The Omega".|$|E
