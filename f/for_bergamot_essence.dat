40|$|Physical {{properties}} are often required for designing post harvest handling/processing equipment <b>for</b> agricultural products. <b>Bergamot</b> is {{a species of}} citrus fruit. Physical properties of <b>bergamot</b> are necessary <b>for</b> equipment used in activities such as transportation, storage, grading, packing, and in food production processes like drying, jam production and so on. In this study some physical properties of bergamot were determined. Properties which were measured included fruit dimensions, mass, volume, projected area, fruit density, shell ratio, geometric mean diameter, sphericity and surface area. Bulk density, porosity and also packing coefficient were measured for three groups of small, medium and large category of bergamots. Experiments were carried out at moisture content of 84. 9 % w. b. <b>for</b> <b>bergamot</b> shell and 87. 34 % w. b. for its meat. Result showed that average mass and volume were 291. 9 g and 456. 83 cm 3, respectively. Dimensions increased from 78. 7 to 160 mm in length, 64. 2 to 128. 5 mm in width, and 64 to 125 mm in thickness. The mean projected area perpendicular to length, width, and thickness obtained 7063. 61, 7933. 39 and 8137. 77 mm 2, respectively. The geometric mean diameter and surface area were calculated as 97. 02 mm, 30412. 31 mm 2, respectively, while sphericity and shell ratio (w. b.) were measured at 0. 89 and 0. 62 %, respectively...|$|R
50|$|Methoxsalen is {{extracted}} from Ammi majus, a plant {{of the family}} Apiaceae. The substance is also present in other Apiaceae as well as Rutaceae, <b>for</b> example <b>bergamot</b> oil which is used in many perfumes and aromatherapy oils. When these products are applied to skin and exposed to UVA radiation, the skin may turn brownish due to the phototoxic effects of methoxsalen present in the bergamot oil. Most modern perfumes containing bergamot have the Methoxsalen removed.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Volatiles from {{flowers at}} three {{blooming}} stages of nine citrus cultivars {{were analyzed by}} headspace-solid phase microextraction (HS-SPME) -GC-MS. Up to 110 volatiles were detected, with 42 tentatively identified from citrus flowers for the first time. Highest amounts of volatiles were present in fully opened flowers of most citrus, except for pomelos. All cultivars were characterized by {{a high percentage of}} either oxygenated monoterpenes or monoterpene hydrocarbons, and the presence of a high percentage of nitrogen containing compounds was also observed. Flower volatiles varied qualitatively and quantitatively among citrus types during blooming. Limonene was the most abundant flower volatile only in citrons; α-citral and β-citral ranked 2 nd and 3 rd only <b>for</b> <b>Bergamot,</b> and unopened flowers of Ponkan had a higher amount of linalool and β-pinene while much lower amount of γ-terpinene and p-cymene than Satsuma. Taking the average of all cultivars, linalool and limonene were the top two volatiles for all blooming stages; β-pinene ranked 3 rd in unopened flowers, while indole ranked 3 rd for half opened and fully opened flower volatiles. As flowers bloomed, methyl anthranilate increased while 2 -hexenal and p-cymene decreased. In some cases, a volatile could be high in bot...|$|R
40|$|S u m m a r y In 2006 – 2007 {{the studies}} aimed {{to compare the}} {{biological}} value of fresh herb of wrinkled-leaf mint (Mentha crispa L.), water mint (Mentha aquatica L.) and three varieties of pepper-mint: bergamot mint (Mentha x piperita L. var. citrata Ehrh.), white peppermint (Mentha x piperita L. var. officinalis Sole f. pallescens Camus) and black peppermint (Mentha x piperita L. var. officinalis Sole f. rubescens Camus) were carried out. Content of dry matter, chlorophyll a, total carotenoids, total polyphenols and antioxidant activity (herb and oil) differed sig-nificantly in the species and varieties of mint tested in the experiment.

As flowers bloomed, methyl anthranilate increased while 2 -hexenal and p-cymene decreased. In some cases, a volatile could be high in both unopened and fully opened flowers but low in half opened ones. Through multivariate analysis, the nine citrus cultivars were clustered into three groups, consistent with the three true citrus types. Furthermore, an influence of blooming stages on clustering was observed, especially with hybrids Satsuma and Huyou. Altogether, it was suggested that flower volatiles can be suitable markers for revealing the genetic relationships between citrus cultivars but the same blooming stage needs to be strictly controlled...|$|R
40|$|Objectives : There is {{very little}} information, to date, on the {{antifungal}} activity of bergamot oil. In this study, we investigated the in vitro activity of three <b>bergamot</b> oils (natural <b>essence,</b> furocoumarin-free extract and distilled extract) against clinically relevant Candida species.

40|$|BackgroundThe {{magnitude}} of multimodal enhancement {{in the brain}} is believed {{to depend on the}} stimulus intensity and timing. Such an effect has been found in many species, but has not been previously investigated in insects. ResultsWe investigated the responses to multimodal stimuli consisting of an odour and a colour in the antennal lobe and mushroom body of the moth Manduca sexta. The mushroom body shows enhanced responses for multimodal stimuli consisting of a general flower odour and a blue colour. No such effect was seen <b>for</b> a <b>bergamot</b> odour. The enhancement shows an inverse effectiveness where the responses to weaker multimodal stimuli are amplified more than those to stronger stimuli. Furthermore, the enhancement depends on the precise timing of the two stimulus components. ConclusionsInsect multimodal processing show both the principle of inverse effectiveness and the existence of an optimal temporal window...|$|R
40|$|Stored {{fish are}} {{frequently}} contaminated by foodborne pathogens. Lipid oxidation and microbial growth during storage {{are also important}} factors in the shelf-life of fresh fish. In order {{to ensure the safety}} of fish items, there is a need for control measures which are effective through natural inhibitory antimicrobials. It is also necessary to determine the efficacy of these products for fish protection against oxidative damage, to avoid deleterious changes and loss of commercial and nutritional value. Some synthetic chemicals used as preservatives have been reported to cause harmful effects to the environment and the consumers. The present investigation reports on the extraction by hydrodistillation and the chemical composition of three citrus peel essential oils (EOs) : orange (Citrus sinensis L.), lemon (Citrus limonum L.) and bergamot (Citrus aurantium L.) from Algeria. Yields for EOs were between 0. 50 % and 0. 70 %. The chemical composition of these EOs was determined by gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC/MS). The results showed that the studied oils are made up mainly of limonene (77. 37 %) for orange essential oil (EO); linalyl acetate (37. 28 %), linalool (23. 36 %), <b>for</b> <b>bergamot</b> EO; and finally limonene (51. 39 %), β-pinene (17. 04 %) and γ-terpinene (13. 46 %) for lemon EO. The in vitro antimicrobial activity of the EOs was evaluated against Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) using the agar diffusion technique. Results revealed that lemon EO had more antibacterial effects than that from other EOs. Minimal inhibitory concentrations (MICs) showed a range of 0. 25 – 0. 40 μL/mL. Lemon and bergamot citrus peel EOs were added at 1 × MIC and 4 × MIC values to Sardina pilchardus (S. pilchardus) experimentally inoculated with S. aureus at a level of 3. 5 log 10 CFU/g and stored at 8 ± 1 °C. The results obtained revealed that the 4 × MIC value of bergamot reduced completely the growth of S. aureus from day 2 until the end of storage. The presence of EOs significantly extended lipid stability. Samples treated with bergamot EO displayed greater antioxidant activity than lemon EO. In fact, the oxidation rate is inversely proportional to the concentration of EO. At 1 × MIC and 4 × MIC values of bergamot EO, the levels of malonaldehyde compared to the control samples were 1. 66 and 1. 28 mg malonaldehyde/kg at the end of storage, corresponding to inhibition percentages of 42. 76 % and 55. 87 %, respectively. These results suggest the possibility that citrus EOs could be used as a way of combating the growth of common causes of food poisoning and used as potent natural preservatives to contribute to the reduction of lipid oxidation in sardines...|$|R

MICs were evaluated for each of the oils alone and combined with sub-inhibitory concentrations of the well-known antiseptic, boric acid. To boric acid, all isolates had MIC values ranging from 0. 094 % to 0. 187 % (w/v). RESULTS: At 24 h readings, the MIC(90) s (for all isolates) were (v/v) : 5 % <b>for</b> natural <b>essence</b> of <b>bergamot,</b> 2. 5 % for the furocoumarin-free extract, and 1. 25 % for the distilled extract. At the 48 h reading, these values increased to > 10 %, 5 % and 2. 5 %, respectively. At both readings, MIC(90) s for all oil+boric acid combinations were significantly lower than corresponding values for the oils alone (P < 0. 05). CONCLUSIONS: These data indicate that bergamot oils are active in vitro against Candida spp., suggesting their potential role for the topical treatment of Candida infections...|$|R
40|$|The {{action of}} {{essential}} oils in reducing soft rot in Chinese cabbage, and {{their influence on}} the colorimetry and physicochemical characteristics of the vegetable were evaluated. In the greenhouse, plants of the cultivar Natsume were sprayed with 11 oils selected in preliminary tests <b>for</b> phytotoxicity: <b>bergamot,</b> lemongrass, copaiba, Eucalyptus citriodora, blue gum, fennel, ginger, spearmint, sweet orange, lemon and clary sage (0. 5 %) and also the antibiotic Mycoshield® (3 g L- 1). After 72 hours the plants were inoculated with Pectobacterium carotovorum subsp. carotovorum (Pcc-c). The oils and the Mycoshield® significantly reduced (P< 0. 05) the severity (SEV) and the area under the disease progress curve (AUDPC). The oils of bergamot, copaiba, E. citriodora, spearmint and sweet orange were then tested for the stability of their effectiveness in the control of three isolates of P. carotovora subsp. carotovorum. These oils reduced the SEV (30. 5 to 38. 6 %) and the AUDPC (23. 1 to 26. 6 %) with no differences between them or the Mycoshield® (SEV 45. 2 and AUDPC 32. 8 %), except for the copaiba (20. 3 %) which was less effective than the antibiotic in {{the reduction of the}} AUDPC. In vitro, only Mycoshield® inhibited the pathogen. None of the treatments altered the colorimetry, levels of ascorbic acid or pH of the leaves of the Chinese cabbage. The spearmint oil increased the total titratable acidity {{in the same way as}} the oils of sweet orange, E. citriodora and bergamot increased the total soluble solids. Therefore, spraying with the oils of bergamot, copaiba, E. citriodora, spearmint and sweet orange has potential in the control of this disease...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{their potential}} for phytoremediation, selected agricultural and indigenous terrestrial plants were examined fortheir capacity to accumulate and degrade the explosive octahydro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetra nitro- 1, 3, 5, 7 -tetrazocine (HMX). Plant tissue and soil extracts were analyzed {{for the presence of}} HMX and possible degradative metabolites using high-performance liquid chromatography with diode-array UV detection (HPLC-UV), micellar electrokinetic chromatography with diode-array UV detection (MEKC-UV), and HPLC with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (LC-MS). The pattern of HMX accumulation for alfalfa (Medicago sativa), bush bean (Phaseolus vulgaris), canola (Brassica rapa), wheat (Triticum aestivum), and perennial ryegrass (Loliumperenne) grown in a controlled environment on contaminated soil from an anti-tank firing range was similar to that observed <b>for</b> plants (wild <b>bergamot</b> (Monarda fistulosa), western wheat grass (Agropyron smithii), brome grass (Bromus sitchensis), koeleria (Koeleria gracilis), goldenrod (Solidago sp.), blueberry (Vaccinium sp.), anemone (Anemone sp.), common thistle (Circium vulgare), wax-berry (Symphoricarpos albus), western sage (Artemisia gnaphalodes), and Drummond's milk vetch (Astragalus drummondii)) collected from the range. No direct evidence of plant-mediated HMX (bio) chemical transformation was provided by the available analytical methods. Traces of mononitroso-HMX were found in contaminated soil extracts and were also observed in leaf extracts. The dominant mechanism for HMX translocation and accumulation in foliar tissue was concluded to be aqueous transpirational flux and evaporation. The accumulation of HMX in the leaves of most of the selected species to levels significantly above soil concentration is relevant to the assessment of both phytoremediation potential and environmental risks.

30|$|Most {{groups have}} {{reported}} {{the detection of}} a single type of target ions or molecules; however, multifunctional CD-based nanoprobes are of great interest as they can detect different target molecules using the same platform. For instance, Yu et al. [38] developed the hydrothermal synthesis of water-soluble CDs from Jinhua <b>bergamot</b> <b>for</b> the detection of Fe 3 + and Hg 2 + ions. The selective detection of Fe 3 + and Hg 2 + was achieved using different buffer solutions. When HAc-NaAc {{was used as the}} buffer solution, the Hg 2 + ions quenched the PL of the CDs. Conversely, Fe 3 + quenched the CD PL when Tris–HCl was used. The influence of the assay buffer on the selective detection of Hg 2 + and Fe 3 + {{is the result of the}} CDs having higher affinity toward Tris–HCl than to Hg 2 +. The quenching of the CD fluorescence by these two metal ions was attributed to the strong binding affinity of these metals to the amino and carboxylic moieties on the outer layer of the CDs. In addition, the redox potential of Hg 2 + and Fe 3 + lies between the conduction band and valence band of the CDs, causing photo-induced electron transfer from the conduction band to the complex states of Hg 2 + and Fe 3 +. Likewise, Chandra et al. [45] reported the detection of iodide and Fe 3 + ions using a nitrogen and phosphorus co-doped CD assay. The LOD for iodide and Fe 3 + were 0.32  µM and 72  nM, respectively. Song et al. [134] developed a microwave-assisted preparation of yellow fluorescent CDs from o-phenylenediamine (OPD) capable of the sensitive detection of Fe 3 + and hydrogen peroxide.|$|R
