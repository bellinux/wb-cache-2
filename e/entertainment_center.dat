5|$|The Fatih district, {{which was}} named after Sultan Mehmed the Conqueror (Turkish: Fatih Sultan Mehmed), {{corresponds}} to what was, until the Ottoman conquest in 1453, {{the whole of the}} city of Constantinople (today is the capital district and called the historic peninsula of Istanbul) on the southern shore of the Golden Horn, across the medieval Genoese citadel of Galata on the northern shore. The Genoese fortifications in Galata were largely demolished in the 19th century, leaving only the Galata Tower, {{to make way for the}} northward expansion of the city. Galata (Karaköy) is today a quarter within the Beyoğlu (Pera) district, which forms Istanbul's commercial and <b>entertainment</b> <b>center</b> and includes İstiklal Avenue and Taksim Square.|$|E
5|$|The 1900 Galveston {{hurricane}} was {{an unparalleled}} disaster. Estimates {{of the death}} toll range from 6,000 to 12,000people, in addition to many more on the Gulf Coast and along {{the shores of the}} bay. Immediately after the hurricane, Galveston worked to revive itself as a port and an <b>entertainment</b> <b>center,</b> including the construction of tourist destinations such as the Hotel Galvez, which opened in 1911. In the same year, the Galveston–Houston Electric Railway opened and became recognized as the fastest interurban rail system in the country. Galveston's port was also rebuilt quickly, and by 1912 had become the second-leading exporter in the nation, behind New York. Nevertheless, after the 1900 storm and another in 1915, many avoided investing in the island.|$|E

5|$|The {{heyday of}} the Free State was over by the 1940s. Because of {{conflicts}} with the United States Treasury, the Hollywood Dinner Club was shut down in the late 1930s. The local clubs found {{it increasingly difficult to}} attract major entertainment figures. Gambling had been legalized in Nevada in 1931 and this distinct advantage over Galveston, and other illegal gambling centers, gradually lured mob figures such as New York City's Bugsy Siegel to Las Vegas. The competition created by the up-and-coming <b>entertainment</b> <b>center</b> in the desert substantially challenged the island on the Gulf over the next several years. Still, even during its later years, the Balinese Room was able to attract the likes of Tony Bennett and Peggy Lee, among others. And as late as 1950 the annual income of the Maceo empire was reportedly $3.84 million ($ in today's terms).|$|E
