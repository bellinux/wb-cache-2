40|$|This {{research}} {{study focused on}} the effect of using <b>damping</b> <b>chamber</b> elements made from waste tires on railway noise reduction. First, the energy absorption characteristics of <b>damping</b> <b>chamber</b> elements with various gradation combinations and compaction indices were measured in the laboratory using compression testing. The laboratory compression results demonstrated that the optimal gradation combination of <b>damping</b> <b>chamber</b> elements is as follows: the content of fine rubber particles is 10 %, the content of coarse granules is 90 %, and the optimal compaction index is 0. 98. Next, the findings from the laboratory compression-test studies were used to produce <b>damping</b> <b>chamber</b> elements that were applied to a full-scale modern track model in the laboratory. The measurements of the dynamic properties indicated that the <b>damping</b> <b>chamber</b> elements could significantly reduce the vibration levels of the rail head. Finally, the <b>damping</b> <b>chamber</b> elements, which had been proven effective through laboratory dynamic tests, were widely applied to test rail sections in the field. The field tests demonstrated that <b>damping</b> <b>chamber</b> elements can significantly increase the track vibration decay rate in the frequency range of 200 – 10000 [*]Hz. Therefore, <b>damping</b> <b>chamber</b> elements made from waste tires are able to control rail vibration and noise in modern tram track systems...|$|E
40|$|The valve {{and seat}} in modern mud pumps {{for oil and}} gas well {{drilling}} are expendable pump parts. New types of valve with a <b>damper</b> <b>chamber</b> without rubber or polyurethane seal and with metal-to-metal contact area and heavy-duty load bearing capacity have been elaborated [1]. Lighter weight body of plate characterizes this design. In comparison with the valve of ordinary construction a valve with a <b>damper</b> <b>chamber</b> contains additional struc-tural elements, which in the moment of setting on of the plate forms the chamber of the pro-moted pressure between a seat and plate. It is considered that application of damper cham-ber will decrease the shock loadings or “hammer-effect ” at the setting of plate. However, for development of reliable working construction it is necessary to resolve next basic problems: – to calculate the optimum size of clearances in <b>damper</b> <b>chamber,</b> – to define speed of landing of plate at the entrance in a <b>damper</b> <b>chamber,</b> – to overcome hydroabrasive wear in the clearances of <b>damper</b> <b>chamber</b> as a result of high speeds of mud flow. It is possible to resolve first two problems by the mathematical model of work of mud pump valve with a <b>damper</b> <b>chamber.</b> For possibility of resolving of mathematical model it is necessary to define the coefficient of discharge in valve by the computer design of fluid flow, as a nonlinear function depending on the height of getting up of plate above a seat.

Forced vibration tests are then conducted with one, two, and three <b>damper</b> <b>chambers</b> containing silly putty. Owing to the limitation of the vibrator used, the performance of these dampers could not be evaluated experimentally until the forcing function was disengaged.

A striking snowwhite species with gymnothecial ascomata, developed in <b>damp</b> <b>chamber</b> on dormouse dung {{collected in a}} cave, was subjected to keratinolytic tests and morphological, cultural, and phylogenetic studies. The keratinolytic ability of this species, associated with a Chrysosporium anamorph and a sexual state of appendiculate reticuloperidia and oblate ascospores, allows {{it to be a}}ccomodated in Onygenaceae. White ascomata, blunt or subcapitate peridial appendages, pitted ascospores, and tuberculate conidia suggest it to be a new Neogymnomyces, and this was confirmed by parsimony analyses of LSU and ITS nrDNA sequences. Following recent phylogenetic analyses, the morphological and physiological features of order Onygenales and its families are re– examined and discussed. After the introduction of a new species, Neogymnomyces is reviewed and compared with all other genera in Onygenaceae.

60|$|On the Absorption {{of certain}} Fluids by the Quadrifid and Bifid processes.--These {{experiments}} were tried {{to ascertain whether}} certain fluids, which seemed adapted for the purpose, would produce the same effects on the processes as the absorption of decayed animal matter. Such experiments are, however, troublesome; for it is not sufficient merely to place a branch in the fluid, as the valve shuts so closely that the fluid apparently does not enter soon, if at all. Even when bristles were pushed into the orifices, they were in several cases wrapped so closely round by the thin flexible edge of the valve that the fluid was apparently excluded; so that the experiments tried in this manner are doubtful and not worth giving. The best plan {{would have been to}} puncture the bladders, but I did not think of this till too late, excepting in a few cases. In all such trials, however, it cannot be ascertained positively that the bladder, though translucent, does not contain some minute animal in the last stage of decay. Therefore most of my experiments were made by cutting bladders longitudinally into two; the quadrifids were examined with No. 8 of Hartnack, then irrigated, whilst under the covering glass, with a few drops of the fluid under trial, kept in a <b>damp</b> <b>chamber,</b> and re-examined after stated intervals of time with the same power as before.|$|R
40|$|The Cape Floral Region {{represents}} one of the world’s biodiversity hot spots, {{with a high level of}} plant, animal and insect endemism. The fungi occurring in this region, however, remain poorly studied. It is widely postulated that each plant species should harbour at least five to six unique fungal species, a number that we regard to be a huge underestimate. To test this hypothesis, we decided to study a single senescent flower of Phaenocoma prolifera (‘everlasting’; Asteraceae) collected in South Africa, and posed the question as to how many different species of fungi could be isolated and cultivated from 10 leaf bracts. Using a <b>damp</b> <b>chamber</b> technique, numerous microfungi could be induced to sporulate, enabling most of them to be successfully isolated on artificial agar media. Isolates were subsequently subjected to DNA sequencing of the ITS and LSU nrDNA regions. During the course of this study 17 species could be cultivated and identified, of which 11 appeared to be new to science. These include Catenulostroma hermanusense, Cladosporium phaenocomae, Devriesia tardicrescens, Exophiala capensis, Penidiella aggregata, P. ellipsoidea, Teratosphaeria karinae, Toxicocladosporium pseudoveloxum spp. nov., and Xenophacidiella pseudocatenata gen. & sp. nov.

The range of beam conditions is chosen to be {{as close as possible to}} those of the ILC damping ring, so that the validated simulation programs can be used to predict the performance of these rings with regard to electroncloud- related phenomena. Using the new simulation code Synrad 3 D to simulate the synchrotron radiation environment, a vacuum chamber design has been developed for the ILC damping ring which achieves the required level of photoelectron suppression. To determine the expected electron cloud density in the ring, EC buildup simulations have been done based on the simulated radiation environment and on the expected performance of the ILC <b>damping</b> ring <b>chamber</b> mitigation prescriptions.

The members are restrained partially at the ends and are of the type being considered by NASA for possible use {{in the construction of}} a future space station.

For the grillage natural vibration, a five wool swab damper configuration provides greater damping than the five silly putty dampers in chamber configuration.

40|$|THE {{experiments}} {{described below}} were undertaken originally {{in conjunction with}} Dr Dacie of King's College Hospital {{in an attempt to}} determine whether a relation exists between the osmotic pressure and the "fragility " of blood corpuscles. It was found, however, that the osmotic pressure differences hardly accounted for the fragility differences, and the experiments were continued on the osmotic pressure alone. Baldes's (1934) modification of A. V. Hill's (1930) vapour-pressure method was used. The thermocouples had very small loops and were constructed by Mr J. L. Parkinson of 47 s. w. g. (51 /i) constantan and manganin wires. The wires were brazed together under a stereoscopic microscope and wound on a former to shape the loops. The couple was then insulated by coating with "Trolitrul " dissolved in benzole, each layer being allowed to dry before applying the next. After removal from the former, two or three coatings of air-drying bakelite varnish ("yacht varnish") were applied and allowed to harden thoroughly under a lamp before the couple was used. The galvanometer was a highly sensitive moving-coil instrument (Zernicke Zc) read at a distance of about three metres. A drop of blood was placed in one loop, and a drop of the standard solution (1 % NaCl) in the other, by means of very fine pipettes which passed through the corks of the fluid containers. This operation was carried out in a <b>damp</b> <b>chamber</b> to prevent evaporation. The loops were immediately covered with a tube lined with filter paper soaked in the standard solution. The whole was then placed in a large water thermostat for 10 min. to settle down. In the first 5 min. a mixture of 5 % COa in oxygen was passed slowly through. The difference of vapour pressure between blood and standard was calculated from the readings by calibrating the couples with the known difference between two solutions. Three thermocouples were used and double determinations were made with each; i. e. the blood was placed first in one loop and then in the other, and the mean taken, to eliminate errors due to lack of symmetry...|$|R

40|$|An Oscillating Water Column (OWC) is a {{wave energy}} {{converter}} consisting of a partially submerged chamber with an air column over the water column. The work done by the air column under excitation by the incident waves is used to generate electrical energy through a power take-off (PTO) device. The air column is under pressure due to the damping from the PTO device and this pressure {{is essential for the}} extraction of wave energy using the OWC. The relationship between the PTO damping and the hydrodynamic efficiency of the OWC provides more insight into the wave energy extraction using an OWC. In this paper, two-dimensional Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulations are used to investigate the response of the OWC under different values of damping from the PTO device. The PTO <b>damping</b> on the <b>chamber</b> is represented using a linear pressure drop law with the permeability coefficient derived from Darcy’s equation for flow through porous media. The model is validated by comparing the numerical results to experimental data. The influence of the PTO <b>damping</b> on the <b>chamber</b> pressure, the free surface motion, the velocity of the vertical motion of the free surface and the hydrodynamic efficiency of the OWC is studied. The hydrodynamic efficiency is calculated as the ratio of the power delivered at the vent of the OWC to the incident wave power. It is found that the PTO damping needed to attain the maximum OWC hydrodynamic efficiency increases with increasing incident wavelength. The formation of stagnation zones in the water due to high velocities for lower values of PTO damping is found to reduce the hydrodynamic efficiency. 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

40|$|The Florida {{harvester}} ant, Pogonomyrmex badius, {{is one of}} many ant {{species and}} genera that stores large numbers of seeds in <b>damp,</b> underground <b>chambers</b> for later consumption. A comparison of the sizes of seeds recovered from storage chambers with those of seed husks discarded following consumption revealed that the used seeds are far smaller than stored seeds. This difference in use-rate was confirmed in field and laboratory colonies by offering marked seeds of various sizes and monitoring the appearance of size-specific chaff. Because foragers collect a range of seed sizes but only open small seeds, large seeds accumulate, forming 70 % or more of the weight of seed stores. Major workers increase the rates at which small and medium seeds are opened, but do not increase the size range of opened seeds. Experiments limiting ant access to portions of natural seed chambers showed that seeds germinate during storage, but that the ants rapidly remove them. When offered alongside non germinating seeds, germinating seeds were preferentially fed to larvae. The rate of germination during the annual cycle was determined by both burial in artificial chambers at various depths and under four laboratory temperatures. The germination rate depends upon the species of seed, the soil/laboratory temperature and/or the elapsed time. The seasonal soil temperature cycle generated germination patterns that vary with the mix of locally-available seeds. Taken together, exploitation of germination greatly increases the resources available to the ants in space and time. While the largest seeds may have the nutritional value of 15 small seeds, the inability of workers to open large seeds at will precludes them from rapid use during catastrophic events. The harvester ant's approach to seed harvesting is therefore two-pronged, with both immediate and delayed payoffs arising from the tendency to forage {{for a wide variety of}} seeds sizes...|$|R

40|$|Saw-tooth {{instability}} {{occurs during}} high current {{operation in the}} Stanford Linear Collider (SLC) damping rings. This instability is single bunch {{and it can be}} cast as a longitudinal microwave instability. It is caused by the beam interaction with short range wakefields in the ring vacuum chamber. The saw-tooth instability manifests itself in the periodic blowup in quadrupole or higher moments in the longitudinal beam distribution. Most of our instability studies have been experimental. Since the measurements of coherent particle motion within a short ultrarelativistic beam are largely unconventional we had to develop some original diagnostics. These includes, for example, the down-conversion of the high frequency (10 GHz) broad-band beam position monitor (BPM) signals. We have also employed the state-of the art Hamamatsu streak camera that is capable of resolving the longitudinal beam distribution with sub-picosecond accuracy. As a result of our streak camera experiments we have quantitatively described the phase space of unstable bunches. We have found the radial structure of the instability mode and established that it only displaces a few percent of the beam particles. In another series of experiments we have correlated the instability signals from the beams before the extraction from the damping rings with their trajectories in the linac downstream. This showed that the instability results in a significant transverse beam jitter in the linac which compromises the damping ring performance as an injector. In addition, we have studied the instability behavior under the broad range of stored beam parameters using both passive and driven excitation. These measurements revealed unexpected beam behavior significantly above the instability threshold. Finally we performed several low current experiments to estimate the <b>damping</b> ring vacuum <b>chamber</b> impedance. We also present some analytical results regarding the instability and compare them to the observations. In particular, these include the explanation of unequal sidebands in the spectrum of the BPM signal coming from unstable bunches.

The ion Mg (II) has practically disappeared from the artificial sea water in which there have been submerged the test specimens of mortar made with cement 1 and with the mixture which has 15 % of slag, in weight; in the remaining means there has been detected the ion Mg (II) in variable quantities according to the mixture utilized in the preparation of the test specimens. The ion Mg (II) has been found in the new solid phases formed in the artificial sea water in which there have been submerged the series of test specimens manufactured with cement 1 and with the mixture which has 15 % of slag; it has precipitated as brucite. &# 13; The content of SO 4 (II) of the artificial sea water ASTM (2. 44 X / 10 - 2 mols. / 800 ml) has likewise experienced a decrease which depends on the mixture utilized in the manufacture of the test speciments and on the time of conservation-attack; in the new solid phase there has been found the ion SO 4 (II) in quantities less than 0. 06 X 10 - 2 mols. When the contents of slag of the mixtures referred to are raised (60 and 70 %, in weight) the contents of SO 4 (II) experiment minimum variations. &# 13; On the contrary, in the content of Cl (I) in the means, (artificial sea water) in which there have been the test specimens of mortar, there is an influence, in a special manner, of the slag in the mixture utilized to manufacture the series of test specimens; the minimum content of said ions Cl (I) corresponds to the case of the mixtures which have 35 and 60 % of slag. En el presente trabajo, continuación de otros, se estudia la variación del pH, así como de la concentración de los iones Ca (II), Mg (II), SO 4 (II) y Cl (I) del agua de mar artificial (ASTM D 1141 - 75) en donde han estado sumergidas las series de probetas de mortero (1 : 3) hechas con un cemento portland industrial de alta resistencia inicial (cemento 1 P- 550 -ARI) y con las mezclas cemento 1 /escoria = 85 / 15 - 65 / 35 - 40 / 60 y 30 / 70, en peso, durante 56 - 90 - 180 y 360 días (períodos de conservación-ataque), en esta etapa, después del período de curado (1 día en cámara húmeda y 21 días bajo agua potable filtrada). Así mismo, se estudia el contenido de los iones Ca (II), Mg (II) y SO 4 (II) de las nuevas fases sólidas formadas en dichos medios de conservación-ataque. La composición estructural de dichas fases sólidas y de la fracción enriquecida de las mencionadas probetas de mortero se determinó por DRX, de ello se dio cuenta en (3). &# 13; En los casos estudiados se ha puesto de manifiesto que se produce un incremento de Ca (II) en la disolución y en las nuevas fases sólidas, así como del valor del pH, que dependen de la mezcla utilizada para fabricar las diversas series de probetas de mortero y del tiempo de conservación-ataque. Dichas cantidades de Ca (II) experimentan, para cada edad, una fuerte disminución conforme la cantidad de cemento 1 de la mezcla es menor y un incremento, para cada mezcla, conforme aumenta el tiempo de conservación-ataque; este incremento es suave para el caso de los medios en donde han estado sumergidas las probetas hechas con las mezclas que tienen los mayores contenidos de escoria (60 y 70 %, en peso). Si, además, se tiene en cuenta el contenido de Ca (II) en el agua de mar artificial ASTM el proceso de disolución de Ca (II) es aditivo. &# 13; El contenido de Mg (II) del agua de mar artificial ASTM (4, 43 X 10 - 2 moles/ 800 ml) experimenta en todos los casos estudiados una disminución que es función de la mezcla utilizada en la fabricación de las diversas series de probetas de mortero y del tiempo de conservación-ataque, que influyen en las condiciones del medio y, de un modo especial, en la concentración de grupos OH (I). El ion Mg (II) ha desaparecido, prácticamente, del agua de mar artificial en donde han estado sumergidas las probetas de mortero hechas con cemento 1 y con la mezcla que tiene 15 % de escoria, en peso; en los restantes medios se ha detectado el ion Mg (II) en cantidades variables según la mezcla utilizada en la elaboración de las probetas. El ion Mg (II) se ha encontrado en las nuevas fases sólidas formadas en el agua de mar artificial en donde han estado sumergidas las series de probetas fabricadas con cemento 1 y con la mezcla que tiene 15 % de escoria; ha precipitado como brucita. &# 13; El contenido de SO 4 (II) del agua de mar artificial ASTM (2, 44 X 10 - 2 moles/ 800 ml) ha experimentado, así mismo, una disminución que depende de la mezcla utilizada en la fabricación de las probetas y del tiempo de conservación-ataque; en la nueva fase sólida se ha encontrado el ion SO 4 (II) en cantidades menores de 0, 06 X 10 - 2 moles. Cuando los contenidos de escoria de las mezclas mencionadas son elevados (60 y 70 %, en peso) los contenidos de SO 4 (II) experimentan variaciones mínimas. &# 13; Por el contrario, en el contenido de Cl (I) en el medio (agua de mar artificial) en donde han estado las probetas de mortero influye, de un modo especial, la cantidad de escoria en la mezcla utilizada para fabricar las series de probetas; el contenido mínimo de dichos iones Cl (I) corresponde al caso de las mezclas que tienen 35 y 60 % de escoria...|$|R
