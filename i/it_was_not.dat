You can never know by {{trying to find out}} what <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> because <b>it’s</b> {{absolute}} reality. You can only know by finding out what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not.</b> So you say, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my body, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my mind, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my organs, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my thoughts, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my world, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> my universe, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> the animals, or the trees, or the moon, or the sun, or the stars, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> any of those things.

5|$|The {{level of}} secrecy of the case, which was criticised by some {{contemporary}} observers, meant that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> properly recorded or published, and the exact {{facts of the}} argument were not known for some time.

5|$|The {{relative}} {{scarcity of}} hyena depictions in Paleolithic rock art has been theorised {{to be due}} to the animal's lower rank in the animal worship hierarchy; the spotted hyena's appearance was likely unappealing to Ice Age hunters, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> sought after as prey. Also, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> a serious rival like the cave lion or cave bear, and it lacked the impressiveness of the mammoth or woolly rhino.|$|E
