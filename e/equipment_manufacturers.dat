25|$|Parts {{designed}} specifically for R-410A must be used as R-410A operates at higher pressures than other refrigerants. Thus R-410A systems require service personnel to use different tools, equipment, safety standards and techniques. <b>Equipment</b> <b>manufacturers</b> are aware of these changes and require the certification of professionals installing R-410A systems. In addition the AC Safety Coalition has been created to help educate professionals about R-410-A system.|$|E
25|$|Copper {{building}} wire {{is compatible}} with brass and quality plated screws. The wire provides connections that will not corrode or creep. It is not, however, compatible with aluminium wire or connectors. If the two metals are joined, a galvanic reaction can occur. Anodic corrosion during the reaction can disintegrate the aluminium. This is why most appliance and electrical <b>equipment</b> <b>manufacturers</b> use copper lead wires for connections to building wiring systems.|$|E
