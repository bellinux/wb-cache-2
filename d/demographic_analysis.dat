The report did not include information about annual indebtedness. A letter to the editor from an industry expert argued that other studies have found that consumers fare better when payday loans are available to them. Pew's reports have focused on how payday lending can be improved, but have not assessed whether consumers fare better with or without access to high-interest loans.

40|$|This note {{describes}} a software utility, called X-batch which addresses two pressing issues typically faced by functional {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) neuroimaging laboratories (1) analysis automation and (2) data management. The first issue is addressed by providing a simple batch mode processing tool for the popular SPM software package ([URL] ucl. ac. uk/spm/; Welcome Department of Imaging Neuroscience, London, UK). The second is addressed by transparently recording metadata describing all aspects of the batch job e. g., subject <b>demographics,</b> <b>analysis</b> parameters, locations and names of created files, date and time of analysis, and so on). These metadata are recorded as instances of an extended version of the Protégé-based Experiment Lab Book ontology created by the Dartmouth fMRI Data Center. The resulting instantiated ontology provides a detailed record of all fMRI analyses performed, and as such can be part of larger systems for neuroimaging data management, sharing, and visualization.

2500|$|The West German {{government}} {{during the}} cold war conducted investigations of the wartime flight and expulsions. The Schieder commission published a series of reports that documented the expulsions based on eyewitness accounts. Schieder chronicled the flight and expulsions, but did not provide background on the wartime crimes of Nazi Germany in Central and Eastern Europe that motivated the Allies to expel the Germans after the war. Schieder in 1953 estimated that 2 million persons perished in Poland, a figure that continues to endure in Germany. Schieder’s estimate of the casualties was superseded by a separate <b>demographic</b> <b>analysis</b> of prepared by the Federal Statistical Office of Germany, in 1958 they estimated losses at 2.225 million. The German Church Search Service working with the German Red Cross attempted to trace and identify those who perished in the expulsions.

2500|$|The total war {{dead in the}} USSR {{includes}} {{victims of}} Soviet oppression. [...] The number of deaths in the Gulag labor camps increased {{as a result of}} wartime overcrowding and food shortages. The Stalin regime deported the entire populations of ethnic minorities considered to be potentially disloyal. Since 1990 Russian scholars have been given access to the Soviet-era archives and have published data on the numbers of people executed and those who died in Gulag labor camps and prisons. The Russian scholar Viktor Zemskov puts the death toll from 1941–1945 at about 1 million based on data from the Soviet archives. The Soviet-era archive figures on the Gulag labor camps {{has been the subject of}} a vigorous academic debate outside Russia since their publication in 1991. J. Arch Getty and Stephen G. Wheatcroft maintain that Soviet-era figures more accurately detail the victims of the Gulag labor camp system in the Stalin era. Robert Conquest and Steven Rosefielde have disputed the accuracy of the data from the Soviet archives, maintaining that the demographic data and testimonials by survivors of the Gulag labor camps indicate a higher death toll. Rosefielde posits that the release of the Soviet Archive figures is disinformation generated by the modern KGB. Rosefielde maintains that the data from the Soviet archives is incomplete; for example, he pointed out that the figures do not include the 22,000 victims of the Katyn massacre. Rosefielde's <b>demographic</b> <b>analysis</b> puts the number of excess deaths due to Soviet repression at 2,183,000 in 1939–40 and 5,458,000 from 1941–1945. Michael Haynes and Rumy Husun accept the figures from the Soviet archives as being an accurate tally of Stalin's victims, they maintain that the demographic data depicts an underdeveloped Soviet economy and the losses in World War Two rather than indicating a higher death toll in the Gulag labor camps.|$|E

50|$|<b>Demographic</b> <b>analysis</b> {{includes}} the sets of methods {{that allow us}} to measure the dimensions and dynamics of populations. These methods have primarily been developed to study human populations, but are extended to a variety of areas where researchers want to know how populations of social actors can change across time through processes of birth, death, and migration. In the context of human biological populations, <b>demographic</b> <b>analysis</b> uses administrative records to develop an independent estimate of the population. <b>Demographic</b> <b>analysis</b> estimates are often considered a reliable standard for judging the accuracy of the census information gathered at any time. In the labor force, <b>demographic</b> <b>analysis</b> is used to estimate sizes and flows of populations of workers; in population ecology {{the focus is on the}} birth, death, migration and immigration of individuals in a population of living organisms, alternatively, in social human sciences could involve movement of firms and institutional forms. <b>Demographic</b> <b>analysis</b> is used in a wide variety of contexts. For example, it is often used in business plans, to describe the population connected to the geographic location of the business. <b>Demographic</b> <b>analysis</b> is usually abbreviated as DA. For the 2010 U.S. Census, The U.S. Census Bureau has expanded its DA categories. Also as part of the 2010 U.S. Census, DA now also includes comparative analysis between independent housing estimates, and census address lists at different key time points.|$|E

Although stress and anxiety can be pharmacologically attenuated, some drugs cause adverse side effects such as bradycardia, immobility, and delirium. There is thus a need for an alternative treatment with no substantial adverse effects. Music intervention is a potential alternative. In the present study, we used cortisol levels, subjective questionnaires, and physiological parameters to explore the anxiety-reducing effects of music intervention {{in a sample of}} ICU patients on mechanical ventilation. Patients admitted to the ICU for 24 hr were randomly assigned to the music intervention (n = 41) or control group (n = 44). Music group patients individually listened to music from 4 : 00 to 4 : 30 p. m.; control group patients wore headphones but heard no music for the same 30 min.

40|$|A study {{examined}} the relationship between the quality and number of domestic and work roles in businesswomen and psychological distress. The study attempted to answer the question: As the number of roles increases does distress increase? The study also considered what aspects of the roles elevate or diminish psychological distress. Following an extensive literature review that revealed contradictory findings about women, roles, and stress, information was gathered through a survey of 104 participants from the University of Chicago Women's Business Group. Participants completed a short survey designed to measure the dispositional characteristics of stress reaction; the rewards and concerns inherent within the roles of worker, partner, and parent; psychological distress; and <b>demographics.</b> <b>Analysis</b> of the scores on the research instruments showed that as the number of roles increased, the level of psychological distress decreased. The positive attributes of assuming multiple roles seemed to offset the pressures leading to psychological distress. This effect was assumed to result from the possibility that having multiple roles cushioned negative stress from any one of the roles. (Contains 56 references.)
