It clearly outlined the dilemma faced by scientists: “Should I strive for personal gain or for scientific contributions? ” It also described what is likely to happen to the theories generated from the subjective and objective approaches. For example, the authors claimed that the subjective approach will yield a fuller hearing for a theory. Given my preference for empirical evidence, I was disappointed that Boal and Willis had little evidence to report. Fortunately, recent research has been done on the above topics. This research supports some of Boal and Willis’s conclusions, but it falsifies their conclusion that the subjective approach will provide a fuller hearing for theories. The evidence seems consistent with Boal and Willis’s summary of the conflict between the advancement of scientists and scientific advancement. My summary of the empirical evidence on this conflict led to the “Author’s Formula ” (Armstrong, 1982 a, p. 197). This states that scientists who are interested in career advancement should: (a) not select an important problem, (b) not challenge existing beliefs, (c) not obtain surprising results, (<b>d)</b> <b>not</b> <b>use</b> simple methods, (e) not provide full disclosure, and (f) not write clearly.

40|$|Abstract. Given a Boolean {{function}} f on n-variables, we find {{a reduced}} set of homogeneous linear equations by solving which one can decide whether there exist annihilators at degree <b>d</b> or <b>not.</b> <b>Using</b> our method {{the size of the}} associated matrix becomes νf × (�d � � n i= 0 − µf), where, i νf = |{x|wt(x) > d, f(x) = 1 } | and µf = |{x|wt(x) ≤ d, f(x) = 1 }| and the time required to construct the matrix is same as the size of the matrix. This is a preprocessing step before the exact solution strategy (to decide on the existence of the annihilators) that requires to solve the set of homogeneous linear equations (basically to calculate the rank) and this can be improved when the number of variables and the number of equations are minimized. As the linear transformation on the input variables of the Boolean function keeps the degree of the annihilators invariant, our preprocessing step can be more efficiently applied if one can find an affine transformation over f(x) to get h(x) = f(Bx + b) such that µh = |{x|h(x) = 1, wt(x) ≤ d} | is maximized (and in turn νh is minimized too). We present an efficient heuristic towards this. Our study also shows for what kind of Boolean functions the asymptotic reduction {{in the size of the}} matrix is possible and when the reduction is not asymptotic but constant...|$|R

40|$|In {{this article}} we outline a rather general {{construction}} of diffeomorphism covariant coherent states for quantum gauge theories. By this we mean states ψ (A,E), labelled by a point (A,E) in the classical phase space, consisting of canonically conjugate pairs of connections A and electric fields E respectively, such that (a) they are eigenstates of a corresponding annihilation operator which is a generalization of A − iE smeared in a suitable way, (b) normal ordered polynomials of generalized annihilation and creation operators have the correct expectation value, (c) they saturate the Heisenberg uncertainty bound for the fluctuations of Â,Ê and (<b>d)</b> they do <b>not</b> <b>use</b> any background structure for their definition, that is, they are diffeomorphism covariant. This is the first paper {{in a series of}} articles entitled “Gauge Field Theory Coherent States (GCS) ” which aim at connecting non-perturbative quantum general relativity with the low energy physics of the standard model. In particular, coherent states enable us for the first time to take into account quantum metrics which are excited everywhere in an asymptotically flat spacetime manifold as is needed for semi-classical considerations. The formalism introduced in this paper is immediately applicable also to lattice gauge theory in the presence of a (Minkowski) background structure on a possibly infinite lattice...|$|R
