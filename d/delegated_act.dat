40|$|The Treaty of Lisbon (TFEU) {{significantly}} {{changes the}} {{theory and practice of}} the delegation of executive powers to the European Commission, powers which resulted in 14, 522 legally binding implementing measures during the sixth legislature under the Barroso I Commission (2004 - 2009) (in comparison to only 454 legislative acts). The Treaty of Lisbon fundamentally alters the way this system works, and in turn the way everyone works with it, especially European and national public administrations. From obscure and informal beginnings in the field of purely technical agricultural markets in the 1960 s, the Lisbon Treaty has in fact made the so-called ‘comitology’ system (and the name) partially redundant. Following the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon on 1 December 2009, there are now two new legal bases; <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts</b> (Article 290) and Implementing Acts (Article 291). This means that the ‘comitology’ world has been split into two. The new system makes a clear separation between tasks delegated to the Commission that only require pure implementation, Implementing Acts, and those that allow the Commission to amend, supplement or delete non-essential elements of the legislative <b>act,</b> <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts.</b> The main changes in the Lisbon system are related to this new category of <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts,</b> where committees cease to exist and the legislators have equal rights to object to individual <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts</b> or even to revoke the delegation to the Commission altogether. Under this new situation the Parliament thus stands on an equal footing with the Council. The implications of these changes are considerable, in both practical and political terms, and therefore require serious attention from the EU institutions, Member States, and outside stakeholders. This short article attempts to address the key changes and questions. Based on the institutions’ Common Understanding on <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts</b> and the new ‘Comitology’ Regulation 182 / 2011 /EU, which entered into force on 1 March 2011, we present the two new avenues and highlight all the important changes. We conclude with our considerations of the practical implications of the new Lisbon system for European and national public administrations...|$|R

40|$|The {{history of}} {{comitology}} – {{the system of}} implementation committees that control the Commission in the execution of delegated powers – has been characterised by institutional tensions. The crux of these tensions has often been {{the role of the}} European Parliament and its quest to be granted powers equal to those of the Council. Over time this tension has been resolved through a series of inter-institutional agreements and Comitology Decisions, essentially giving the Parliament incremental increases in power. This process came to a head with the 2006 Comitology reform and the introduction of the regulatory procedure with scrutiny (RPS). After just over three years of experience with the RPS procedure, and having revised the entire acquis communautaire, the Treaty of Lisbon made has made it redundant through the creation of <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts</b> (Article 290 TFEU), which gives the Parliament equal rights of oversight. This article aims to evaluate the practical implications that <b>Delegated</b> <b>Acts</b> will entail for the Parliament, principally by using the four years of experience with the RPS to better understand the challenges ahead.

The question arises whether growers will be able to continue to collectively negotiate prices with producers after the end of the quota regime, as is the current practice. Unlike in the milk, arable crops, olive oil and beef sectors, there is no explicit collective negotiation provision for sugar beet growers in the CMO. However, the rules for the sugar sector do provide for the collective negotiation of inter-professional agreements between associations of beet growers and sugar manufacturers (so-called agreements within the trade). The legislation has been recently integrated with a <b>Delegated</b> <b>Act</b> 7 opening the possibility to introduce a value sharing formula, including market bonuses and loses, being discussed between beet growers and manufacturers during the negotiation process.|$|E
40|$|By February 2019, the Polish {{pharmaceutical}} industry, {{community and}} hospital pharmacies, wholesalers, and parallel traders must all {{comply with the}} EU-wide Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD) legislation (2011 / 62 /EU), to ensure no medicinal product is dispensed to a patient without proper tracking and authentication. Here we describe how Poland is complying with the new EU regulations, the actions {{that have been taken}} to incorporate the FMD into Polish Pharmaceutical Law, and whether or not these actions are sufficient. We found that Poland is currently only partially compliant with the FMD, and further actions need to be undertaken to fully meet the <b>Delegated</b> <b>Act</b> (DA) requirements. Moreover, there is lack of awareness in Poland surrounding the prevalence of falsified medication, and the time scale required for implementation of the DA. Based on our findings, we suggest that a public awareness campaign is created to provide awareness of the increased number of falsified medicines in the legal supply chain, and that drug authorization systems are implemented into Polish pharmacies to support the FMD...|$|E
40|$|Background: Recently, the European Union has {{introduced}} the Falsified Medicines Directive (FMD). Additionally, in early 2016, a <b>Delegated</b> <b>Act</b> (DA) {{related to the}} FMD was published. The main objective {{of this study was}} to evaluate the usefulness of external audits in the context of implementing new regulations provided by the FMD in the secondary care environment. Methods: The external, in-person workflow audits were performed by an authentication company in three Polish hospital pharmacies. Each audit consisted of a combination of supervision (non- participant observation), secondary data analysis, and expert interviews with the use of an independently designed authorial Diagnostic Questionnaire. The questionnaire included information about hospital drug distribution procedures, data concerning drug usage, IT systems, medication order systems, the processes of medication dispensing, and the preparation and administration of hazardous drugs. Data analysis included a thorough examination of hospital documentation in regards to drug management. All data were subjected to qualitative analysis, with the aim of generating meaningful information through inductive inference. Results: Only one dispensing location in the Polish hospitals studied has the potential to be a primary authentication area. In the audited hospitals, an Automated Drug Dispensing System and unit dose were not identified during the study. Hospital wards contained an enclosed place within the department dedicated to drug storage under the direct supervision of senior nursing staff. An electronic order system was not available. In the largest center, unused medications are re- dispensed to different hospital departments, or may be sold to various institutions. Additionally, in one hospital pharmacy, pharmacists prepared parenteral nutrition and chemotherapeutic drugs for patients admitted to the hospital. Conclusions: External audits might prove beneficial in the course of introducing new regulations into everyday settings. However, such action should be provided before the final implementation of authentication services. To sum up, FMD can impact several hospital departments...|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze the {{characteristics}} of teacher directed modeling evidenced in the practices of three experienced high school choral directors. Research questions were: 1. What modeling activities were exhibited in each teacher's rehearsals? 2. When viewing a 45 -minute composite tape of each teacher's instructional activities representative of all rehearsals, what instructional behaviors did each choral director recognize and identify as modeling? 3. What instructional episodes on the composite tape not identified by the teachers contained elements of modeling? 4. What other episodes from the remainder of each choral director's rehearsal practice contributed to an understanding of modeling? Videotapes of three high school choral directors were recorded over the course of one semester. Excerpts from rehearsals were combined to form a 45 -minute composite tape of each choral director. A text transcription was made of the composite tape. Participant directors viewed their tape and identified instructional episodes that they recognized as examples of modeling. Identifications were analyzed, and descriptive categories of modeling behaviors were established. Modeling was found to be a teacher generated or <b>delegated</b> <b>act</b> of demonstration. Demonstrations were musical or non-musical and belonging to either of three distinct categories: audible, visible, or process modeling. Subdivisions of each category were found further describing modeling in the high school choral rehearsal. In addition, types of modeling were noted in increasing cognitive complexity required on the part of students beginning with simple imitation and concluding with models as tools for musical problem solving. Research is recommended on a larger sample of participants, including junior high/middle school directors to confirm categories and levels and to develop an observation tool based on results for describing, assessing, and modifying instructional techniques of practicing and pre-service music educators...|$|E
40|$|Art. 5 of the recast Energy Performance of Buildings Directive (EPBD, Directive 2010 / 31 /EU) {{requires}} EU Member States to {{take into}} account cost optimality when defining energy per formance requirements by considering initial investment costs, running costs and replacement costs over the life-cycle of a building. In March 2012 the European Commission published the <b>Delegated</b> <b>Act</b> No. 244 / 2012 (including explanatory guidelines), in which the methodological approach of cost optimality calculations as to be applied under the EPBD is described. Although this regulation includes harmonised standards for some important input parameters, it leaves considerable degree of freedom to the Member States for selecting input parameters according to their choice. As a result, calculations on cost optimality will {{play a crucial role in}} setting the energy performance levels in the Member States and may act as brakes or accelerators on the way towards nearly zero energy buildings. Based on long-term experience in life-cycle cost assessment of buildings and on selected examples of available cost opti-mality calculations from the Member States under the EPBD regime, the paper analyses – in a first step – the impact of the most important input parameters on the results. In a second step an approach of a quick “top-down” plausibility check of cost optimality calculations is developed. This approach aims at increasing transparency of cost optimality calculations and follows several assessment steps “from general to particular”, as follows: • Check 1 : Plausibility of the shape of the cost curve (e. g. flatness respectively steepness in certain energy performance areas); • Check 2 : Plausibility of the most important input parameters and their relation among each other; • Check 3 : Completeness of the methodology applied. The paper concludes that a large share of cost optimality assessments which are available – including those presented in this paper – suggest that considerable tightening of minimum energy performance requirements can be argued not only from an energy performance but also from an economic point of view. On the other hand, since the EU regulation offers a high degree of freedom on the actual implementation of cost optimality calculations, very different results cannot be completely excluded...|$|E

This chapter argues that approaching decision-making procedures of <b>delegated</b> and implementing <b>acts</b> only from an institutional lens is normatively insufficient, in two respects. First, it is incongruous with the Treaty provisions on democracy: not only an inter-institutional perspective is insufficient to ensure the democratic legitimacy of <b>delegated</b> and implementing <b>acts,</b> but also it ignores the relationships between the makers of legal acts and the outer sphere composed of citizens and legally affected persons. Secondly, it also overlooks core functions of procedures that are relevant to ensure the legitimacy of public acts. Procedures are a means to rationalise public action, by channeling information, weighing competing interests, and allowing scrutiny of the choices made. If designed accordingly, procedures could concretise democracy as a Union founding principle also in the making of <b>delegated</b> and implementing <b>acts...</b>|$|R

This conntribution answers the question of to what extent Dutch legislative drafters fulfil a role of ‘guardian of EU law’. Using in-depth interviews, the paper analyses legislative drafters’ role conceptions and their strategies in case national political demands prove incompatible with EU legal requirements. It finds that most Dutch legislative drafters try to reconcile EU law with their ministers’ political demands, if necessary by reinterpreting EU law. When this proves unfeasible, most respondents prioritize political loyalty over EU legality.
