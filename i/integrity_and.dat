5|$|Cells cannot {{function}} if DNA damage corrupts the <b>integrity</b> <b>and</b> {{accessibility of}} essential {{information in the}} genome (but cells remain superficially functional when non-essential genes are missing or damaged).

If possible, cells use the unmodified complementary strand of the DNA or the sister chromatid as a template to recover the original information. Without access to a template, cells use an error-prone recovery mechanism known as translesion synthesis as a last resort.|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{complexity in}} Military Command and Control (C 2) systems {{has led to}} greater vulnerability due to system availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> caused by internal vulnerabilities and external threats. Several studies have proposed measures of availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> for the assets in the C 2 systems using precise and certain measures (i. e., {{the exact number of}} attacks on the availability <b>and</b> the <b>integrity,</b> the number of countermeasures for the availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> attacks, the effectiveness of the availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> countermeasure in eliminating the threats, and the financial impact of each attack on the availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> of the assets). However, these measures are often uncertain in real-world problems. The source of uncertainty can be vagueness or ambiguity. Fuzzy logic and fuzzy sets can represent vagueness and ambi-guity by formalizing inaccuracies inherent in human decision-making. In this paper, the authors extend the risk assessment literature by including fuzzy measures for the number of attacks on the availability <b>and</b> the <b>integrity,</b> the number of countermeasures for the availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> attacks, <b>and</b> the effectiveness of the availability <b>and</b> <b>integrity</b> countermeasure in eliminating these threats.

5|$|Laws {{dealing with}} digital {{evidence}} {{are concerned with}} two issues: <b>integrity</b> <b>and</b> authenticity.

Authenticity refers to the ability to confirm the integrity of information; for example that the imaged media matches the original evidence. The ease with which digital media can be modified means that documenting the chain of custody from the crime scene, through analysis and, ultimately, to the court, (a form of audit trail) is important to establish the authenticity of evidence.|$|E
