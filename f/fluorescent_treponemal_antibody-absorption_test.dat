40|$|A new {{enzyme-linked}} immunosorbent assay with Treponema pallidum antigen {{bound to}} ferrous metal beads (Syphilis Bio-EnzaBead; Litton Bionetics Laboratory Products) was compared with the standard <b>fluorescent</b> <b>treponemal</b> <b>antibody-absorption</b> <b>test</b> for syphilis. Bio-EnzaBead and fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption tests were done on 218 specimens from documented cases of syphilis, on 315 sera from individuals with diseases other than syphilis, and on sera submitted to a public health laboratory for premarital (304 specimens) or diagnostic (501 specimens) tests for syphilis. Agreement between the Bio-EnzaBead and reference tests ranged from 93. 0 % for sera for the diagnostic test to 99. 5 % for sera from patients with syphilis. The overall agreement among the 1, 338 sera tested was 96. 3 %. The reproducibility of the Bio-EnzaBead test with 60 coded sera of graded reactivity was 97 %.

40|$|Immunofluorescent {{staining}} of Treponema pallidum was {{studied to}} clarify the effect of three factors {{on the results of}} the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption test: (i) heat inactivation of sera at 56 degrees C for 30 min before testing, (ii) use of multicircle slides, and (iii) tungsten illumination to visualize and assess unstained treponemes on reactive as well as nonreactive smears. It was found that serum inactivation before testing was not necessary for detection of immunoglobin G antibody, but an immunoglobulin M prozone was detected in unheated serum. On multicircle slides, it was demonstrated that a false-positive reaction could be obtained in 30 s at 37 and 25 degrees C if a smear where a nonreactive serum had been placed was crossed by a strongly reactive serum from another circle. Tungsten illumination proved necessary for correct assessment of unstained treponemes on all fluorescent treponemal antibody-aborption test smears, reactive or nonreactive.

At autopsy, large thromboembolic masses filled the pulmonary trunk and both pulmonary arteries. Thrombi were also noted in the right popliteal vein and bilateral gastrocnemius and soleus veins, suggesting bilateral lower extremity deep vein thrombosis. Dissection of the brain, which weighed 1457  g, revealed no noteworthy macroscopic findings.

40|$|Objectives The {{present study}} {{was carried out in}} seven {{maternity}} hospitals to determine the prevalence of maternal syphilis at the time of delivery and the associated risk factors, to conduct a pilot project of rapid syphilis testing in hospital laboratories, to assure the quality of syphilis testing, and to determine the rate of congenital syphilis in infants born to women with syphilis at the time of delivery — all of which would provide baseline data for a national prevention programme in Bolivia. Methods All women delivering either live-born or stillborn infants in the seven participating hospitals in and around La Paz, El Alto, and Cochabamba between June and November 1996 were eligible for enrolment in the study. Findings A total of 61 out of 1428 mothers (4. 3 %) of live-born infants and 11 out of 43 mothers (26 %) of stillborn infants were found to have syphilis at delivery. Multivariate analysis showed that women with live-born infants who had less than secondary-level education, who did not watch television during the week before delivery (this was used as an indicator of socioeconomic status), who had a previous history of syphilis, or who had more than one partner during the pregnancy were at increased risk of syphilis. While 76 % of the study population had received prenatal care, only 17 % had syphilis testing carried out during the pregnancy; 91 % of serum samples that were reactive to rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests were also reactive to <b>fluorescent</b> <b>treponemal</b> <b>antibody-absorption</b> (FTA-ABS) <b>testing.</b> There was 96 % agreement between the results from local hospital laboratories and national reference laboratories in thei...|$|R
40|$|A double-staining {{procedure}} for the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>treponemal</b> <b>antibody-absorption</b> <b>test,</b> using fluorescein isothiocyanate as a label for the class-specific anti-human globulin and tetramethylrhodamine isothiocyanate as a label for a counterstain reagent, has been described. This method requires {{the addition of}} a KP 560 barrier filter, with a microscope equipped with vertical illumination, to exclude the rhodamine emission in reading the fluorescein fluorescence. The present study evaluated reversing the dye label for each conjugate in the double-staining procedure, thus eliminating the need for the KP 560 filter. It also considered the possibility of shortening the counterstaining time and compared various methods for preparing antigen slides in an attempt to establish a method that increases the number of treponemes per microscopic field. The results indicate that a rhodamine-labeled class-specific anti-human globulin as a primary stain, and a fluorescein-labeled anti-treponemal globulin as a counterstain, provide an acceptable method for performing the fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption double-staining procedure. Nonfixed antigen slides were held for 16 days in a desiccator or stored in plastic bags with silica gel for 3 weeks; then, with methanol fixation, they were used satisfactorily in the double-staining procedure.

40|$|An {{automated}} {{diagnostic test}} instrument and its development program are described. The instrument automates the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>treponemal</b> <b>antibody-absorption</b> <b>test</b> for syphilis {{to the extent}} that only 4 hr of technician time is required to conduct approximately 200 tests daily. Evaluation to date suggests its efficacy. In addition, preliminary studies indicate the feasibility of detecting antibodies to Toxoplasma gondii, Plasmodium malariae, and nucleoprotein (antinuclear factor). The instrument would seem to have broad application for routine and research immunofluorescence testing. Two elements comprise the instrument: a slide processor and a microscope attachment. The slide processor is an electro-pneumatically actuated device which automatically feeds special laboratory slides, on which antigen or other reagents are prefixed, through a series of operations which provide reagent application, incubation, washing, drying, and stacking of the finished slides for readout. The instrument provides flexibility in that incubation time and temperature as well as point, sequence, and duration of reagent application can be varied to accommodate a variety of immunofluorescence techniques. The microscope attachment can be fitted to all conventional dark-field fluorescence microscopes and makes possible the reading of three to six slides per minute. The reacted slides from the processor are injected sequentially onto the stage of the microscope by movement of a lever. As injected, slides are automatically in visual focus; fine focus is occasionally required. Scanning of the reacted field is accomplished by means of the normal microscope controls. A buffered glycerol coupling is maintained between the darkfield condenser substage lens and the slide cover glass by means of a pushbutton-actuated feed system...|$|E

MÉTODOS: Estudo {{transversal}} com amostra aleatória probabilística de 3 047 puérperas, tendo como critério de elegibilidade as gestantes admitidas para parto ou curetagem nos centros selecionados. Após a entrevista foi coletada alíquota de sangue para realização de teste do Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL). No caso de VDRL positivo, foi realizado o teste fluorescent treponemal antibody-absorption (FTA-abs). O evento considerado para análise foi a positividade para VDRL confirmada pelo FTA-abs. Na análise estatística foi estimada a razão de chances (OR) com intervalo de confiança de 95 %. A adequação do modelo foi feita pelo teste de Hosmer-Lemeshow. RESULTADOS: A prevalência de sífilis na amostra estudada foi de 1, 7 %. A análise multivariada mostrou que o maior risco de positividade para VDRL estava associado a renda familiar menor do que 1 salário mínimo, idade OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate the}} {{factors associated with}} positive syphilis serology results in puerperal women who were receiving care at 24 health centers accredited by Brazil's National Program on Sexually Transmitted Diseases and AIDS. METHODS: This cross-sectional study included a probabilistic random sample of 3 047 puerperal women. The eligibility criterion was being admitted for delivery or curettage in the selected centers. After an interview to collect demographic and clinical information, a blood sample was taken and then examined with the Venereal Disease Research Laboratory (VDRL) slide test. With positive VDRL results, the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>treponemal</b> <b>antibody-absorption</b> <b>test</b> (FTA-Abs) was used for confirmation. The event considered for analysis was positivity on the VDRL test, with confirmation by the FTA-Abs. For the statistical analysis, odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. The model fit was assessed using the Hosmer-Lemeshow test. RESULTS: The prevalence of syphilis among the women studied was 1. 7 %. Multivariate analysis showed that increased risk for positive VDRL and FTA-Abs results {{was associated with the}} following characteristics: family income below one minimum wage, age < 17 years at first sexual intercourse, age < 14 years at first pregnancy, history of syphilis or of other sexually transmitted diseases prior to the current pregnancy, treatment for syphilis during the current pregnancy, partner having been tested for syphilis, having a positive HIV test result or having no HIV test result on record, previous preterm delivery, and stillbirth as an outcome of pregnancy. Only 43 % of the women had had six or more prenatal visits, and only 3 % had had one VDRL test during the first trimester of pregnancy and another VDRL test during the third trimester, as is recommended by Brazil's national Ministry of Health. CONCLUSIONS: This study shows that the problem of congenital syphilis is far from being solved in Brazil. It is necessary to provide adolescents with family planning services as well as guidance on sexual issues, to improve prenatal follow-up, and to research the history of sexually transmitted diseases in both the pregnant woman and her sexual partner...|$|E
40|$|Background. Our {{objective}} {{was to determine the}} impact of combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) and the degree of immunosuppression on biologic false-positive (BFP) rapid plasma reagin (RPR) tests among persons in-fected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Methods. This was a nested retrospective study of HIV-infected patients enrolled in the Johns Hopkins HIV Clinical Cohort. BFP RPR was defined as a reactive RPR and a nonreactive <b>fluorescent</b> <b>treponemal</b> <b>antibody-absorption</b> (FTA-ABS) <b>test.</b> Patients with BFP tests were compared to 2 control groups: HIV-infected patients (1) with active syphilis (reactive RPR and FTA-ABS) and (2) without current syphilis (nonreactive RPR). A persis-tent BFP test was defined by having at least 2 visits with consistent BFP at all visits. Results. Of 711 patients with HIV, 96 (13. 5 %) had BFP tests and 342 (48. 1 %) had syphilis. Twenty-two of 96 (23 %) had persistent BFP tests. cART use was associated with decreased odds of BFP tests compared to having syph-ilis (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 0. 31; 95 % CI,. 15 –. 63) and those with nonreactive RPR (AOR, 0. 42; 95 % CI,. 22 –. 81). cART use was also associated with decreased odds of BFP persistence (AOR, 0. 07; 95 % CI,. 01 –. 33). Neither CD 4 count nor HIV RNA was significantly associated with BFP test results. Lower RPR titers, younger age, and injection drug use were associated with increased odds of BFP. Conclusions. The use of cART appears to decrease the odds of BFP RPR tests. This finding suggests that non-treponemal titer fluctuations in persons with HIV may reflect the influence of factors unrelated to syphilis disease activity...|$|R
40|$|Samples of {{cerebrospinal}} fluid (CSF) and serum collected {{over a period}} of approx-imately four years from four chimpanzees infected with Treponema pallidum were studied. The VDRL slide test, the Treponema pallidum immobilization- 200 (TPI- 200) test, and several fluorescent-antibody procedures were used in the examination of the spinal fluid. Sera were examined with the VDRL slide and <b>fluorescent</b> <b>treponemal</b> <b>antibody-absorption</b> (FTA-ABS) <b>tests.</b> None of the ani-mals showed reactivity in the CSF before inoculation. The immunofluorescence techniques usually detected reactivity in the CSF before the VDRL slide test. The TPI- 200 test was considerably less reactive with CSF than either the immuno-fluorescence procedures or the VDRL slide test. Reactivity of the immunofluo-rescence and VDRL slide tests with the CSF was delayed and weaker than reactivity of these tests with serum. Results suggest that evaluation of the FTA technique with CSF of humans might lead to use of an FTA test in diagnosis of syphilis of the central nervous system of humans. Because of their many similarities to humans, chimpanzees (Pan troglodytes) have long been of interest to those who do research on syphilis [1, 2]. Reports to date have been concerned mainly with the cutaneous and serum antibody changes which follow infection [2 - 6]. There have been few, if any, accounts of changes in antibody in the {{cerebrospinal fluid}} (CSF).

40|$|Syphilis is an infective sexually {{transmitted}} disease, {{caused by an}} anaerobic filamentous spirochete, named Treponema Pallidum, which may be present in variable and different clinical forms. Over the last decade, this pathology has emerged in Western Europe with an unusual recrudescence, despite the well-known preventive measures, 1, 2, 3, 4 probably due to easy of travel and loosening of national boundaries. 5 We describe {{a case of a}} middle-age Caucasian woman with oral secondary syphilis, which clinically and immuno-histologically simulated a pemphigus vulgaris (PV). A 47 year-old woman was referred to our Oral Medicine Unit by her general practitioner for a desquamative gingivitis localized at the anterior lower teeth and for a bullous-erosive lesion localized at the right edge of the tongue. The Nikolsky’s sign was positive. Histology with haematoxylin/eosin revealed a suprabasal epithelial detachment with a prominent eosino-neutrophilic infiltrate, suggesting a possible PV. Direct immunofluorescence (DIF) showed positive for intercellular cement substance (ICS), with its classic “net-like” aspect. Indirect immunofluorescence using monkey oesophagus, and ELISA testing for Dsg 1 / 3 and BP 180 / 230 were negative. The diagnosis of PV was confirmed and the patient received 75 mg of prednisone daily. One week after commencing therapy, she developed rosy-circular papulosquamous lesions on the palms and soles, for which she was referred to a dermatologist, who suspected a diagnosis of secondary syphilis and, thus, recommended stopping the corticosteroids and performing the serological tests for syphilis. The venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test showed a titer of 1 : 1280, the treponema pallidum hemagglutinin assay (TPHA) showed strong positivity as did the IgG <b>fluorescent</b> <b>treponemal</b> <b>antibody-absorption</b> (FTA-abs) <b>test.</b> Histology from the skin biopsy revealed a suprabasal epithelial detachment with an abundant mixed inflammatory infiltrate in the underlying dermis, unlike the common histopathology of syphilis. 6 Thus, the immuno-histochemistry (anti-CD 38) on the oral biopsy specimen was performed and revealed the presence of Treponema. After the diagnosis of secondary syphilis, she received 1. 200. 000 U. I. of benzylpenicillin benzathine twice a week and, four weeks later, all lesions healed. Syphilis is also known as “the great imitator”, due to its ability to present clinically multiform muco-cutaneous aspects. In the oral cavity, it may occur in all three stages and the two most common features of secondary syphilis are represented by maculopapular lesions and mucous patches, which may coalesce and give snail-track ulcers. Although oral ulcerations in secondary syphilis are rare findings, they have been described and may show as oval ulcers covered by a white or gray pseudomembrane. Our patient only had tongue ulceration, with an erythematous-erosive lesion of the lower gum. Such clinical features, supported by the immuno-histological findings of a suprabasal acantholysis with a strong positive IgG autoantibody signal against the ICS, and a positive C 3 C accumulation, led us to make an initial diagnosis of PV. Although the histological and clinical characteristics of secondary syphilis are somewhat variable, simulating different diseases, such as oral hairy leukoplakia, cutaneous eczema, nonetheless, to our knowledge, an acantholytic lesion with a positive DIF has never previously been described as a pattern of secondary syphilis. PV is an autoimmune muco-cutaneous blistering disease (AMBD), which, commonly, enters into the differential diagnosis with other autoimmune bullous diseases and not with infectious diseases, except the Herpes virus family. Thus, this case focuses on the probability of a possible serious misdiagnosis and, then, on the need to consider the AMBDs in the differential diagnosis of secondary syphilis. The routine serologic tests for syphilis are mandatory in all cases in which, during the therapy, the disease shows any curious abnormality, which might lie outside an AMBD...|$|R
40|$|Study of sera from 69 {{patients}} with untreated or inadequately treated latent syphilis revealed that immunoglobulin (Ig) G antibodies {{made up the}} bulk of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>treponemal</b> <b>antibody-absorption</b> (FTA-ABS) -test reactivity found in the sera. IgM and IgA antibodies also contributed in some cases. Venereal Disease Research Laboratory slide-test reactivity was found in both 19 and 7 S serum fractions, whereas Treponema pallidum immobilization-test reactivity was found mainly in the 7 S fraction...|$|R
40|$|A 55 -year-old female {{presented}} with bilateral progressive retinal vasculitis. She was on systemic and intravitreal steroids {{on the basis}} of uveitis work-up result (negative result including rapid plasma reagin), but her visual acuity continued to deteriorate to light perception only. Ocular examination showed retinal vasculitis, multiple yellow placoid lesions and severe macula edema in both eyes. Repeated work-up revealed positivity of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>treponemal</b> <b>antibody-absorption</b> in serum and subsequently in cerebrospinal fluid. Ocular syphilis was diagnosed. And intravenous penicillin G resulted in rapid resolution of vasculitis and macular edema. To avoid delay in the diagnosis of ocular syphilis, high index of suspicion and repeating serological tests (including both treponemal and non-treponemal tests) are warranted...|$|R
40|$|Properly prepared, standarized, {{and stored}} <b>fluorescent</b> <b>treponemal</b> <b>antibody-absorption</b> (FTA-ABS) {{reagents}} {{have been shown}} to have stabilities equal to other biological reagents. A liquid antigen over 10 years old has been shown to give a satisfactory reaction. Newer preparations have now been shown to be stable for over 5 years, and the tests on each are being continued. The very new liquid antigens which were originally standardized by the FTA-ABS method have shown no decrease in potency over a 20 -month period. Stability studies on antigens dried on slides are now in their eighth month, with no apparent loss in potency. The stability of the conjugate is constant when stored frozen at − 20 C or lyophilized. When stored as a liquid at 4 C, the stability is governed by the pH and the molarity of the buffer. The standardized and lyophilized sorbent {{has been shown to be}} stable for over 1 year...|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} methods to {{diagnose}} meningeal syphilis. One {{of the most}} common ways include visualizing the organisms by immunofluorescence and dark field microscopy. Dark field microscopy initially had the finding that the spirochete has a corkscrew appearance and that it is spirillar and gram (-) bacteria. Another method would also be through the screening test and serology. Serology includes two types of antibody test: Nontreponemal antibody test and Treponemal antibody test (specific test). The Nontreponemal antibody test screens with VDRL (Venereal Disease Research Lab) and RPR (Rapid Plasma Reagin). The Treponemal antibody test (specific test) confirms with FTA-ABS (<b>Fluorescent</b> <b>treponemal</b> <b>antibody-absorption).</b> Brain imaging and MRI scans may be used when diagnosing patients; however, they do not prove to be as effective as specific tests. Specific tests for treponemal antibody are typically more expensive because the earliest anitbodies bind to spirochetes. These tests are usually more specific and remain positive in patients with other treponemal diseases.|$|R
40|$|An enzyme {{immunoassay}} for {{the diagnosis of}} syphilis (ELISA-SY) was developed with solid-phase extracts of Treponema pallidum, specimen diluent containing Reiter treponeme absorbent, and three 30 -min incubations. The ELISA-SY results were determined in comparison with a standardized positive control and reported {{as a percentage of}} strong positive control. In tests with 1, 005 serum samples from a venereal disease clinic and other sources, 98. 2 % agreement was found with <b>fluorescent</b> <b>treponemal</b> <b>antibody-absorption</b> (FTA-ABS) results, and 98. 3 % agreement was found with T. pallidum passive hemagglutination (PHA) findings. Only 1 of 29 sera originally considered to be biologically false-positive by ELISA-SY; the latter specimen was also positive by PHA and FTA-ABS tests performed in our laboratories. Serum samples from clinically diagnosed syphilitics (16 primary-stage isolates, 7 secondary-stage isolates, and 3 -latent-stage isolates) were all positive by ELISA-SY, FTA-ABS, and PHA. Serum samples from 51 newborns suspected of having syphilis on the basis of positive cardiolipin flocculation tests showed 98 % agreement of ELISA-SY results with FTA-ABS and PHA findings. Sera from all 61 patients with a variety of autoimmune and other diseases known to be associated with biologically false-positive reactions for syphilis were negative by this ELISA-SY. The specificity of the ELISA procedure for T. pallidum antibody was also confirmed immunologically by blocking experiments...|$|R
