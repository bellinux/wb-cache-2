5|$|The Watcher and {{his companions}} pursue Thaos {{to the city of}} Twin Elms, where they finally learn the truth behind Thaos' actions. The gods are {{synthetic}} beings created by ancient animancers to serve as a civilizing force for the world, which doesn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> gods. Thaos is the last survivor of their order, and has survived the centuries by transferring his soul from one body to the next. His eternal mission is to ensure that no one discovers the gods' secret, because then mortals would question their divine authority, and the world could then regress into sectarianism and barbarism. To this end, he works to discredit and suppress animancy wherever it flourishes, because modern animancers may eventually discover the truth through their science. He stole the souls of the Hollowborn to empower the goddess Woedica, who hates animancy and would see it destroyed. Though the other gods have an interest in protecting their secret, they do not want Woedica to dominate them, and so they help the Watcher reach Thaos.|$|E

This era consolidated Galicia as a Christian society which spoke a Romance language. During the next century Galician noblemen took northern Portugal, conquering Coimbra in 871, thus freeing what were considered the southernmost city of ancient Galicia.|$|E

25|$|The non-real {{roots of}} a real {{polynomial}} with real coefficients can be grouped into pairs of complex conjugates, namely with the two members of each pair having imaginary parts that differ only in sign and the same real part. If the degree is odd, then by the intermediate value theorem {{at least one of}} the roots is real. Therefore, any real matrix with odd order has at least one real eigenvalue, whereas a real matrix with even order may not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> eigenvalues. The eigenvectors associated with these complex eigenvalues are also complex and also appear in complex conjugate pairs.|$|E
25|$|Lo Stato Operaio (The Workers' State) (March 1940 – December 1943) — This was {{actually}} another {{publication of the}} Communist Party of Italy, published in exile in New York City after its suppression {{by the government of}} France {{at the start of the}} war. The publication maintained a limited circulation in the United States, with a very few copies being sent back for underground distribution in Italy. The paper was too far away from the center of activities of the PCI to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> political significance and was discontinued by the party at the end of 1943.|$|E
25|$|In 949 Constantine {{launched}} a new fleet of 100 ships (20 dromons, 64 chelandia, and 10 galleys) against the Arab corsairs hiding in Crete, but like his father's attempt to retake the island in 911, this attempt also failed. On the Eastern frontier things went better, even if with alternate success. In 949 the Byzantines conquered Germanicea, repeatedly defeated the enemy armies, and in 952 they crossed the upper Euphrates. But in 953 the Hamdanid amir Sayf al-Daula retook Germanicea and entered the imperial territory. The land in the east was eventually recovered by Nikephoros Phokas, who conquered Hadath, in northern Syria, in 958, and by the Armenian general John Tzimiskes, who one year later captured Samosata, in northern Mesopotamia. An Arab fleet was also destroyed by Greek fire in 957. Constantine's efforts to retake themes lost to the Arabs were the first such efforts to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> success.|$|E

25|$|Immediately upon joining, Riddell {{knew that}} he could assist in {{improving}} the ritual. He was appointed to a ritual committee consisting of himself, LeRoy Fairchild, George Beal, Adon Smith, and William West. The first revision was undertaken with earnest. Riddell would bring his sense of showmanship to the ritual, adding in many flashy and fanciful Persian portions. Beal, on the other hand, had more interest in classical mythology and wanted those elements incorporated into the work. A compromise was found that incorporated Beal’s desires, but also included the theatrical elements proposed by Riddell, not to mention the devilish motif that was still intact from the early days. From then on, only Beal would <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> say in changes to the ritual, which remains his legacy to this day. In 1917, Beal would be officially lauded by the Supreme Council for his work, cementing his place in Grotto history.|$|E
25|$|The Committee, {{initially}} {{consisting of}} a professor of English literature, two members of parliament, a Church of Ireland clergyman and a Roman Catholic priest heard submissions from individuals, organisations and institutions, including religious and social institutions. Its report, which expressed dissatisfaction with the existing laws, {{was presented to the}} minister on 28 December 1926. One problem was {{that the vast majority of}} the publishers of offensive material operated outside Ireland, leaving only individual booksellers and distributors liable to prosecution. Their prosecution did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> impact on the availability of objectionable material. Another problem was that powers of customs and postal authorities to seize this material was ill-defined and seizure was thus ineffectual. The Committee concluded that it was the Irish state's duty to prevent the circulation of publications that were considered to be obscene and morally corrupting. The Committee proposed the introduction of new legislation and the establishment of a censorship board to advise the minister on which publications should be prohibited. The new legislation – the Censorship of Publications Act, 1929 – established the Censorship of Publications Board.|$|E

[...] While reviewing the Buggles' second album, the same author stated that both albums [...] "still sound fresh" [...] compared to 1990s pop music. An Amazon.com editor named Grant Alden also compared the album to 1990s pop, and labeled the group as [...] "Part of the early-1980s great explosion of pop music [...] to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> impact". Trouser Press called both albums [...] "technically stunning, reasonably catchy and crashingly hollow." ...|$|E
500|$|Pavement {{was formed}} in 1989 in Stockton, California, by Stephen Malkmus and Scott Kannberg. Malkmus and Kannberg had {{previously}} performed together in the band Bag O' Bones. Pavement had its start playing at open mike nights at clubs and bars. The songs the band played during this time were mostly covers, although they also performed many original songs that would later be released on Slay Tracks. Malkmus recalls, [...] "It was pretty reasonable {{to be able to}} make a single for $1,000, so we decided to go for it. We didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> plans because we weren't a real band." [...] Two local studios existed in Stockton, the cheaper and less professionally minded of which was Gary Young's Louder Than You Think Studio. The band decided to record at Young's studio due to their admiration of other local punk bands who had recorded there, including The Young Pioneers and The Authorities. Kannberg reportedly borrowed $800 from his father to record Slay Tracks.|$|E
500|$|Several reviewers re-watched Star Trek: The Next Generation {{after the}} end of the series.

He thought that the episode felt more similar to an [...] story than a normal Next Generation story, and that was due to the episode's origins. He said [...] "overall, it’s just dumb" [...] and gave it a score of two out of ten. Zack Handlen thought more positively of the episode when he reviewed it for The A.V. Club. He did think that Captain Picard was pretending to be Captain Kirk for most of the episode and that it didn't <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> drama but that it was [...] "silly, goofy fun for the most part". He thought the episode was [...] "cute" [...] and gave it an overall score of B+.|$|E

[...] Lamar Hafildason of the BBC gave the film one out of five stars, saying: [...] "Sadly, the BBC does not pay out for one-word reviews. If it did, then this review would read simply: 'tiresome'." [...] In 2001, Matt Brunson from Creative Loafing gave the film one and a half stars out of four concluding: [...] "a rockin' soundtrack... and a peek at Watts early in her career are the only ingredients saving this from a bomb rating."

500|$|Criticism of Mediocre {{has been}} mostly positive, and many critics highly acclaim the album. The Rolling Stone staff rated Mediocre four stars, and Rolling Stones average viewer rating is {{four and a}} half stars. Mark Kemp, a music {{journalist}} from Rolling Stone, called Mediocre one of the strongest debuts from a female singer-songwriter since Norah Jones' Come Away with Me, exclaiming [...] "There's sultry torch songs, folky ballads, smart rock — and not a bum track among them." [...] Ron Bronson, a music journalist from the website SoMinty, awarded Mediocre five stars. He describes Sariñana's voice on Mediocre as being [...] "something along the lines of Nellie McKay meets countryman Julieta Venegas meets Sia. [...] original, in other words. Very original.... If you <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> desire to listen to music en español, you'll be [...] to find a better singer on the indie scene these days. Ximena has got chops, folks." [...] Ernesto Sánchez of People en Español labeled Mediocre [...] "one of the most promising Latin Music albums of [...] ". Eric Danton of The Hartford Courant pointed out that [...] "her prospects in the United States are less predictable thanks to a fragmented radio landscape and what for many English-speaking listeners is a language barrier." ...|$|E
500|$|Apart from Mike Schmidt, Jeremy Fitzgerald, Fritz Smith, and Michael (a {{character}} {{whose voice}} is heard in Five Nights at Freddy's: Sister Location), {{none of the}} other human characters in the series <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real,</b> or at least confirmed, names. In the first three games, a man simply identified as [...] "Phone Guy" [...] leaves a recording over the phone {{at the beginning of each}} night which serves as advice to the player on how to deal with the animatronics. Phone Guy is present through all five nights of Five Nights at Freddy's 2, four of the main nights in Five Nights at Freddy's, and four of the main nights in Five Nights at Freddy's 3 (as well as in Night 6 for the second and third games.) He is not present in the fourth and fifth games, though his first night recording from the original game is sometimes played backwards as ambiance in Five Nights at Freddy's 4. His call at the start of Night 4 in Five Nights at Freddy's implies that he was killed by the animatronics. In the third game, he is heard over archival recordings discovered by the creators of Fazbear's Fright. Sister Location instead features a human A.I. named [...] "HandUnit", who like Phone Guy, acts as a tutor to the player. [...] The first two nights of the third game also feature [...] "Phone Dude", one of the creators of Fazbear's Fright.|$|E

500|$|Lamb {{appeared}} {{to the justice}} to be a profoundly troubled young man. There was {{no doubt that he}} had killed Chaykoski and Woloch, he had not acted in self-defence and {{there was no evidence of}} provocation; the chances of reducing the murder charge to manslaughter were therefore slim. Nosanchuk felt obliged, in the light of Lamb's psychiatric and personal history, to explore an insanity plea. The lawyer interviewed Yaworsky and Dolan, secured them as witnesses for the trial, and also reviewed a report from four doctors at Penetanguishene who had previously interviewed his client. According to this report, Lamb had been amiable, fluent in his conversation and apparently plausible; he at first claimed amnesia for the events of 25 June, but on continued questioning related what had happened [...] "in detail". He admitted his responsibility but still did not appear to be concerned about what had happened. He did not seem to be able to emotionally appreciate the consequences of his actions, even though he understood on an intellectual level that he had shot at some people and that to do that was wrong. When he told the psychiatrists that he regretted what he had done, they wrote that he [...] "clearly did not <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> underlying feeling of remorse". He also did not appear to have considered that he might be suffering from any illness, mental or otherwise. The Penetanguishene report concluded that Lamb [...] "suffered from a disease of the mind as a pathological anti-social or psychopathic personality", which was a recognised psychiatric disorder under the Criminal Code and therefore grounds for an insanity defence in court.|$|E
500|$|The {{film was}} {{similarly}} well received in North America. MSNBC gave the movie a perfect 5 star rating. The film {{was described as}} taking James Bond [...] "back to his roots", similar to From Russia with Love, where {{the focus was on}} character and plot rather than the high-tech gadgets and visual effects that were strongly criticised in Die Another Day. Rotten Tomatoes gave the movie an aggregate rating of 95%, the highest rating for a wide-release of the year. It is the fourth-highest rating for a Bond film on the site behind Goldfinger, From Russia with Love, and Dr. No, all of which earned a 96% score. Metacritic gave the movie a Metascore of 80, signifying [...] "generally favorable reviews". Entertainment Weekly named the film as the fifth best of the series, and chose Vesper Lynd as the fourth best Bond girl in the series. Some newspaper columnists and critics were impressed enough by Craig's performance to consider him a viable candidate for an Academy Award nomination. Roger Ebert gave the film a four out of four star rating, and wrote that [...] "Craig makes a superb Bond... who gives the sense of a hard man, wounded by life and his job, who nevertheless cares about people and right and wrong," [...] and that the film [...] "has the answers to all my complaints about the 45-year-old James Bond series," [...] specifically [...] "why nobody in a Bond movie ever seems to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> emotions." [...] Time Out New Yorks Joshua Rothkopf called Craig [...] "the best Bond in the franchise's history," [...] citing the actor's [...] "crisp, hateful, Mamet-worthy snarl... This is a screwed-up Bond, a rogue Bond, a bounder, a scrapper and, in the movie's astoundingly bleak coda, an openhearted lover." ...|$|E
500|$|In A Midsummer Night's Dream, Theseus, the Duke of Athens, is {{preparing}} to marry Hippolyta. Peter Quince decides to entertain her and hires a group of actors nicknamed the Rude Mechanicals to perform Pyramus and Thisbe, a love story. Robin {{is one of the}} Rude Mechanicals, the tailor, who gathers with his colleagues to prepare their production. Robin at first is told to play the part of Thisbe's mother, but Peter Quince points out that a love story needs moonlight shining on the lovers to <b>have</b> <b>any</b> <b>real</b> effect on the audience. After Nick Bottom suggests looking in the almanac for a time when the Moon might shine on their performance, the players apparently decide that they will just have Robin act as Moonshine. Robin's role as Moonshine in The Mechanical's performance of Pyramus and Thisbe before Theseus' court is often highlighted by scholars as among the funnier parts of the play. Although the court makes fun of all the players, Starveling is mocked the most by Hippolyta, who is very vocal in her opinion that his attempt to be moonshine is a ridiculous failure, although very humorous. [...] He is also the only mechanical to be cut off in his monologue as opposed to being mocked afterwards, causing him to fluster and summarise his lines rather than giving them. [...] This summary is usually played angrily or irritably, but has also been performed as the climax of Starveling's potential stage fright. [...] Starveling is the member of the group that seems to be afraid of just about anything. [...] Starveling is the most ambiguous in taking sides in the power struggle between Bottom and Quince. [...] While Snout affirms whatever Quince says and Flute always looks to Bottom for the final word on something (Snug is too slow to be bothered), Starveling seems to try to agree completely with both, as impossible as it is to do so.|$|E
