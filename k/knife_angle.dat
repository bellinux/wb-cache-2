50|$|Unlike western knives, Japanese knives {{are often}} single ground, i.e., {{sharpened}} {{so that only}} one side holds the cutting edge. As shown in the image, some Japanese <b>knives</b> are <b>angled</b> from both sides, and others are angled only from one side, with {{the other side of}} the blade being flat. It was originally believed that a blade angled only on one side cuts better and makes cleaner cuts, though requiring more skill in its use than a blade with a double-beveled edge. Usually, the right hand side of the blade is angled, as most people use the knife with their right hand, with ratios ranging from 70-30 for the average chef's knife, to 90-10 for professional sushi chef knives; left-handed models are rare and must be specially ordered and custom made.|$|R

40|$|In this study, {{the surface}} {{roughness}} values of planed beech-wood (Fagus L.), oak-wood (Quercus L.) and fir-wood (Abies alba Mill.) specimens were examined. The samples of beech-wood were cut from steamed beech-wood and from thermally modified beech-wood (212 oC). The specimens were machined by planing in radial directions with two knives at 6, 12, 18 and 24 m/min feed speed. The cutting depth of 2. 0 mm was constant and <b>knife</b> rake <b>angle</b> was 15 o. The machining experiments {{were carried out}} using a single cutter-block of a Weinig Powermat 400.

50|$|The {{smaller the}} angle between the blade and stone, the sharper the knife will be, but the less side force {{is needed to}} bend the edge over or chip it off. The angle between the blade and the stone is the edge angle - the angle from the {{vertical}} {{to one of the}} knife edges, and equals the angle at which the blade is held. The total angle {{from one side to the}} other is called the included angle - on a symmetric double-ground edge (a wedge shape), the angle from one edge to the other is thus twice the edge angle. Typical edge angles are about 20° (making the included angle 40° on a double-ground edge). The edge angle for very sharp knives can be as little as 10 degrees (for a 20° included <b>angle).</b> <b>Knives</b> that require a tough edge (such as those that chop) may sharpen at 25° or more.|$|R
5000|$|Chisel grind — As on a chisel, {{only one}} side is ground (often at an edge angle of about 20 - 30°); the other remains flat. As many Japanese culinary knives tend to be chisel ground they are often sharper than a typical double {{bevelled}} Western culinary knife; a chisel grind has only a single edge angle; if a sabre ground blade has the same edge angle as a chisel grind, it still has angles {{on both sides of}} the blade centerline, and so has twice the included <b>angle.</b> <b>Knives</b> that are chisel ground come in left and right-handed varieties, depending upon which side is ground. Japanese knives feature subtle variations on the chisel grind: firstly, the back side of the blade is often concave, to reduce drag and adhesion so the food separates more cleanly; this feature is known as urasuki. Secondly, the kanisaki deba, used for cutting crab and other shellfish, has the grind on the opposite side (left side angled for right-handed use), so that the meat is not cut when chopping the shell.|$|R

The need of this task arise during {{the start of the}} development of a new packaging line were this equipment were meant to be used. An evaluation of the bagdryers capacity and capability was necessary. The work started with gathering of information from suppliers of the used components and from the responsible engineers for this equipment. An education to learn how the equipment worked and how to operate it were taken. That was followed by the creation of a study plan were the tests were planned to test different parameters effect on the drying result and to see if the bagdryer managed to handle the bags of the correct format in the pace that the equipment should be designed for. The test results detected a need of designing a unit with a function that holds the bags in place while passing through the dryer in order to attain high quality results. The results were later used for optimization of the design. The parameters that had the biggest effect on the result were the distance and the airflow. When the concepts were chosen the detailed design was initiated and the result of this is described in chapter 7 Resultat. Shortly, the result from the design work can be described as a unit that holds the bags in place while drying. The unit. s height is adjustable and the air <b>knives</b> tilting <b>angle</b> and height can also be adjusted.

50|$|Very sharp knives sharpen {{at about}} 10 dps (degrees per side) (which {{implies that the}} knife's edge has an {{included}} angle of 20-degrees). Generally speaking, razors, paring knives, and fillet knives should be the sharpest <b>knives</b> at an <b>angle</b> of 12° - 18°. Most kitchen knives, like utility/slicing knives, chef’s knives, boning knives, carving knives, should be sharpened to 15° - 25°. The exceptions are Japanese style knives that are usually sharpened to 14° - 16° depending on the knife maker. Japanese style knives utilize a much harder steel, {{and are therefore more}} brittle than their Western style counterparts. This means care should be taken when handling these knives as they are susceptible to chipping and breaking. The sporting knife category, including pocket knives, survival knives, and hunting knives, sees more intense action and should be sharpened to the 25° - 30° angle range. The less sharp angle means there is more metal there to cut, thus providing more durability out in the field. For an extremely durable edge, a machete, chisel, drawknife or ax should be sharpened down to 30° - 40° providing even more ruggedness and longer lasting sharpness.|$|R

É possível baixar o custo de produção quando se trabalha em menores rotações, em virtude do valor do consumo específico ser reduzido. Embora o DPM- 4 tenha apresentado menor demanda energética, ressalta-se que esta máquina possui maior preço de aquisição que os outros dois modelos e maior dificuldade de alimentação, obrigando o produtor a contratar mais uma pessoa para executar este processo. The {{production capacity}} and specific energy consumption in forage choppers type Disintegrator/Chopper/Grinder for elephant grass processing were evaluated.

The oblique angle of 10 º led to greater efficiency for the three DPMs. In some situations, the oblique angle of 38 º provided better performance for DPMs 1 and 2, while in others, the angle of 30 º provided better performance for DPM- 4. It is possible to lower production costs, when working at lower rotation speeds, due to the specific consumption being reduced. Although the DPM- 4 has presented a lower energy demand, it is worth pointing out that this machine is more expensive than the other two models and presents greater difficulty in feeding, forcing the farmer to employ an extra person to execute this process...|$|R
