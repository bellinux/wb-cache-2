40|$|In the {{determination}} of contaminants (dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyls, polyaromatic hydrocarbons), cell-based assays are useful methods for screening purposes: they are mainly characterized by high sample throughput and lower costs than the Mass Spectrometry (MS) -based methods. Although cell-based assays can be sensitive enough for {{the determination}} of dioxins and related substances {{in agreement with the}} presently tolerable limits in food and <b>feed</b> (<b>Regulation</b> No. 2375 / 2001 /EC and Directive 2003 / 57 /EC respectively), their lack of specificity make their use rather questionable in control laboratories. In this paper, we present and compare results obtained from the analysis of a limited number of feed samples by both gas chromatography-high resolution mass spectrometry (GC-HRMS) and cell-based assay (DR-CALUX: dioxin responsive-chemically activated luciferase gene expression) methods. The DR-CALUX screening led to less than 10 % false non-compliant and no false compliant results. In addition, there is a good correlation between GC-HRMS and DR-CALUX data. However, these preliminary results have to be confirmed on a larger number of samples to demonstrate that total toxic equivalent (TEQ), including dioxins, furans and dioxin-like polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) can be monitored in feed and food with a cell-based assay.

The estimated total daily or weekly intakes of a specific substance are compared with the established tolerable weekly intakes (ΤWI) or with the reference values BMDL, in order to assess the risk from the chronic exposure of the population to this substance.

40|$|The three-element {{system for}} {{automatic}} water-level regulation in the boiler shell {{as well as}} its modifications received maximal dissimilation in the Republic of Belarus and the CIS countries power economies. Though, they possess the following shortages: occurrence of the steadystate errors {{at the end of the}} transient process during the control response to internal disturbances and those by over-heated steam; large level deviations at sharp and significant load changes, which often leads to the boiler or the power block deloading or stoppage. As a remedial action against the mentioned disadvantages, the invariant systems for the drum boiler automatic <b>feed</b> <b>regulation</b> were developed earlier. The first variant of the automatic regulation invariant system with the equivalent external disturbance individualization differs from the typical one in the way that they select the stabilizing controller arrangement on the basis of transmission response of the optimal controller. And the compensating device dynamic settings structure and parameters are chosen with respect to the equivalent controlled member including the stabilizing controller inner contour. The second variant offers the compensating device transmission response to the equivalent external disturbance represented as series-connected typical sections: a real differentiator and a quick-response unit. For the control action maximum value reducing in this scheme, there is a suppressing device additionally installed at the exit of the equivalent external disturbance compensation device. The automatic regulation invariant systems eliminate steady-state errors at all impacts and allow improving significantly the level control quality at variable conditions. For economic efficiency evaluation of the boiler-shell water level automatic regulation innovative system implementation as a system, the author proposes a technique allowing calculating the main components of the economic effect of its implementation.

40|$|SummaryWe {{investigated}} serotonin signaling in C. elegans as {{a paradigm}} for neural regulation of energy balance {{and found that}} serotonergic regulation of fat is molecularly distinct from <b>feeding</b> <b>regulation.</b> Serotonergic <b>feeding</b> <b>regulation</b> is mediated by receptors whose functions are not required for fat regulation. Serotonergic fat regulation is dependent on a neurally expressed channel and a G protein-coupled receptor that initiate signaling cascades that ultimately promote lipid breakdown at peripheral sites of fat storage. In turn, intermediates of lipid metabolism generated in the periphery modulate feeding behavior. These findings suggest that, as in mammals, C. elegans feeding behavior is regulated by extrinsic and intrinsic cues. Moreover, obesity and thinness are not solely determined by feeding behavior. Rather, feeding behavior and fat metabolism are coordinated but independent responses {{of the nervous system}} to the perception of nutrient availability...|$|R

40|$|The current obesity {{epidemic}} {{and lack}} of efficient therapeutics demand {{a clear understanding of}} the mechanism underlying body weight regulation. Despite intensive research focus on obesity pathogenesis, an effective therapeutic strategy to treat and cure obesity is still lacking. Exciting studies in last decades have established the importance of hypothalamic agouti-related protein-expressing neurons (AgRP neurons) in the regulation of body weight homeostasis. AgRP neurons are both required and sufficient for <b>feeding</b> <b>regulation.</b> The activity of AgRP neurons is intricately regulated by nutritional hormones as well as synaptic inputs from upstream neurons. Changes in AgRP neuron activity lead to alterations in the release of mediators, including neuropeptides NPY and AgRP, and fast-acting neurotransmitter GABA.

Based on the network of peptidergic neurons, the former are involved in positive <b>feeding</b> <b>regulation,</b> and the latter are involved in negative feeding, which exert these feeding-regulated peptides especially in paraventricular nucleus (PVN).
