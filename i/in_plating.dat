5|$|Nickel {{is one of}} four {{elements}} (iron, cobalt, nickel, and gadolinium) {{that are}} ferromagnetic at approximately room temperature. Alnico permanent magnets based partly on nickel are of intermediate strength between iron-based permanent magnets and rare-earth magnets. The metal is valuable in modern times chiefly in alloys; about 68% of world production is used in stainless steel. A further 10% is used for nickel-based and copper-based alloys, 7% for alloy steels, 3% in foundries, 9% <b>in</b> <b>plating</b> and 4% in other applications, including the fast-growing battery sector. As a compound, nickel has a number of niche chemical manufacturing uses, such as a catalyst for hydrogenation, cathodes for batteries, pigments and metal surface treatments. Nickel is an essential nutrient for some microorganisms and plants that have enzymes with nickel as an active site.|$|E

50|$|A {{closely related}} process is brush electroplating, in which {{localized}} areas or entire items are plated using a brush saturated with plating solution. The brush, typically {{a stainless steel}} body wrapped with a cloth material that both holds the plating solution and prevents {{direct contact with the}} item being plated, is connected to the positive side of a low voltage direct-current power source, and the item to be plated connected to the negative. The operator dips the brush <b>in</b> <b>plating</b> solution then applies it to the item, moving the brush continually to get an even distribution of the plating material.Brush electroplating has several advantages over tank plating, including portability, ability to plate items that for some reason cannot be tank plated (one application was the plating of portions of very large decorative support columns in a building restoration), low or no masking requirements, and comparatively low plating solution volume requirements. Disadvantages compared to tank plating can include greater operator involvement (tank plating can frequently be done with minimal attention), and inability to achieve as great a plate thickness.|$|E

5000|$|For plating to be possible, {{there must}} be {{constant}} variants in details of the stamps printed from a single plate or lithographic stone so that one can identify the exact original position of each stamp. Evidence {{that may be used}} <b>in</b> <b>plating</b> includes defects or [...] "flaws" [...] occurring in the transfer of images, individual touch-ups by the engraver, recuttings of the plates, repairs, and accidental injuries to the plates. In addition, stamps may have be laid out in an irregular fashion on the plate with the result that differences in spacing and orientation of the stamps may be used to determine their plate positions. From their inception in 1840 until 1884, postage stamps from Great Britain incorporated control letters in the corners indicating the stamps's exact position on the sheet, e.g., A...C is first row, third stamp, and for a period also incorporated the number of the plate from which the stamps were printed. Other evidence such as color of the ink used or watermarks in the paper may be of use in reconstructing plates. In the absence of such evidence, plating is not possible. Because of the highly accurate methods of modern stamp production, most modern issues cannot be plated.|$|E
50|$|Philatelists {{have made}} {{extensive}} efforts <b>in</b> <b>plating</b> {{many of the}} Nineteenth Century Classic postage stamp issues and have written {{a number of books}} on plating different stamp issues. One of the greatest philatelic achievements is the plating of the Penny Black and its succeeding Penny Red Brown stamps issued beginning in 1840. Those stamps were printed in sheets of 240 stamps. The plates would wear as printing went on and were often replaced. Beginning with the 71st plate of Die II in 1858, the plate number was inconspicuously engraved on the stamps themselves. All the stamps bore control letters which indicated the exact position on the sheet, so that reconstructing the plates beginning with plate 71 is simply a matter of finding the necessary stamps. The stamps printed from the first 70 plates of Die II and all the plates from Die I 200, however, bore no numbers to indicate the specific plate used to print them, and their plating presented vastly greater problems. Through painstaking study of the stamps, philatelists were able to reconstruct most or all of the first Die II's 70 plates. Later philatelists were assisted when reference copies and high quality photographs of the original panes kept by the British Government were made available for inspection. The other early engraved stamp issues of Great Britain have similarly been plated.|$|E
50|$|The Director of Naval Construction began {{preliminary}} design work {{even before the}} ship was purchased and submitted an outline design on 8 February 1918. This design had a full-length flight deck and its most distinctive features were the two islands separated by the flight deck. Each island was to be 110 ft long, containing two funnels and a tripod mast. Although they were staggered {{to make it more}} difficult for an enemy ship to estimate the ship's course, they were to be connected to each other with heavy bracing. The bridge was to be mounted on top of this bracing which left a clear height of 20 ft for the aircraft on the flight deck. There was to be a 68 ft wide space between the islands where the aircraft were to be assembled before taking off. Aircraft would be transported between the hangar and the flight deck by two aircraft lifts (elevators). A crane was to be located at the aft end of each island to lift aircraft aboard and to recover seaplanes. Bulk petrol storage consisted of 15,000 imp gal in 2 imp gal tins stowed on the forecastle deck and protected by 1 <b>in</b> <b>plating.</b> Two ready-use tanks near the islands would allow aircraft on the flight deck to refuel. The ship's planned armament consisted of nine 6-inch guns and four 4 in anti-aircraft guns mounted on the platform between the islands. Eagle retained the battleship's mixture of coal and fuel oil, but the quantities were increased to 3200 LT of coal and 1750 LT of oil, as the forward and rear 14-inch magazines and shell rooms were converted to be used as oil tanks.|$|E
