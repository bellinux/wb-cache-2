On September 4, teams from the Ministry of Works, the Department of <b>Environmental</b> <b>Health</b> Services, the Royal Bahamas Defence Force and the Royal Bahamas Police Force were used to clear roadways of tree debris while utilities attempted to restore power and water in New Providence. The Family Islands were surveyed on September 5 and 6, when {{it was noted that}} major damage occurred within the island group. Telecommunications were restored to most of the island chain within 24 hours. As of September 21, electricity had been restored to half of the Bahamians who had lost power. Western sections of Grand Bahama Island remained without power into Hurricane Jeanne, which was the most significantly impacted island. The onion crop was expected to be late in 2005 due to the loss of seedbeds and seedlings during the storm.|$|E

40|$|Environment {{and health}} are {{interlinked}} {{areas that are}} generating increasing interest and relevance in view of achieving a sustainable society. This is the main argument for increased emphasis on <b>environmental</b> and <b>health</b> issues in science education. However, beyond this foreground goal, environment and health problems provide a background of opportunities {{to ask questions about}} the nature and role of science in society. From a positivist technical perspective, environment and health are well-defined measurable resources or states that can be controlled by well-educated individuals. <b>Environmental</b> and <b>health</b> education and related research approaches have, for a certain time, followed this line. From a socio-scientific perspective, the potential of <b>environmental</b> and <b>health</b> issues lies in searching beyond the surface: What notions of environment and health can be identified, how are they represented in society, and how are they represented in science? How do members of society, such as citizens, politicians, and scientists, come to know about what matters in current and future <b>environmental</b> and <b>health</b> developments? And what concepts do people have about how <b>environmental</b> and <b>health</b> problems might be approached? Such questions illustrated by examples and related research approaches are challenges for a socio-scientific orientation in science teaching...|$|R

5|$|Two life-history {{features}} of amphibians are {{often cited as}} a reason why amphibians are good indicators of <b>environmental</b> <b>health</b> or 'canaries in the coal mine'. Like all amphibians, the long-toed salamander has both an aquatic and terrestrial life transition and semipermeable skin. Since they serve different ecological functions in the water {{than they do in}} land, the loss of one amphibian species is equivalent to the loss of two ecological species. The second notion is that amphibians, such as long-toed salamanders, are more susceptible to the absorption of pollutants because they naturally absorb water and oxygen through their skin. The validity of this special sensitivity to environmental pollutants, however, has been called into question. The problem is more complex, because not all amphibians are equally susceptible to environmental damage because there is such a diverse array of life histories among species.|$|E

Methods. HELIX-Atlanta, initiated in October 2003 to develop data linkage and analysis methods that can be used by the National <b>Environmental</b> Public <b>Health</b> Tracking Network (Tracking Network), conducted four projects. We highlight the projects' work, assess attainment of the HELIX-Atlanta goals and discuss three surveillance attributes. Results. Among the major challenges was the complexity of analytic issues which required multidiscipline teams with technical expertise. This expertise and the data resided across multiple organizations. Conclusions:Establishing formal procedures for sharing data, defining data analysis standards and automating analyses, and committing staff with appropriate expertise is needed to support wide implementation of <b>environmental</b> public <b>health</b> tracking...|$|R
