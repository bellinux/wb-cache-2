40|$|Major auction {{trading service}} {{providers}} have solved technological problems {{of dealing with}} millions of simultaneous biddings. Unfortunately, {{it is challenging to}} provide logistics that fulfils massive and lumpy demands in auction industry. Dynamic uncertainties make the auction planning, scheduling and execution control more complex. Moreover, the existing centralized approaches are frequently limited in their efficiency due to the large variations of deployed assets and numerous auction parameters to be considered. Meanwhile, Internet of Things (IoT) and cloud technology have been widely used in several industrial applications. These emerging technologies can enable real-time data collection, proactive response actions, as well as improved process visibility. Based on intelligent platform technologies, this thesis is among the first to systematically propose the concept of real-time auction logistics (AL). It {{is an essential part of}} perishable supply chain trading that plans, implements and controls the efficient, effective flow and storage of products, services and related information driven by auctions to meet both operators and customers' requirements. A research framework is established to provide guidelines for investigating real-time planning, scheduling and execution control in auction logistics. Four typical scenarios are examined. The first scenario presents cloud-based auction logistics information platform following three-layer standardized architecture while considering auction characteristics. Motivated by an industrial case of flower auction trading, practitioners are confronted with challenges to fully utilize real-time decision-makings to synchronize both material flow and information flow for multiple users. The proposed cloud platform is expected to make auction planning scalable with respect to transient demands by implementing autonomous logistics. Through the integration of IoT and cloud computing technologies, interactive omnichannel auction bidding is established. Heterogeneous physical assets such as auction trolleys could be easily virtualized, traced and tracked, and managed in the cloud. The second scenario demonstrates an adaptive scheduling for perishable goods auction. Following the hybrid flowshop scheduling (HFS) classification, a timely model for trolley loading and auction trading stages is developed. It is an extension of a typical HFS problem with several characteristics. A heuristic-based solution approach is proposed to minimize either makespan or value loss using a set of dispatching rules. The simulation experiments justify that schedulers can flexibly select dispatching rules under various demand patterns and operation time windows, as well as system configurations and trolley sizes. The third scenario discusses a new paradigm of <b>goods-to-person</b> auction execution method using cloud auction robot (CAR). CARs are used to pick up and deliver the auction products according to the given commands in real-time. A scalable CAR-enabled execution system (CARES) is presented to manage logistics workflows, tasks and behaviour of CAR-Agents in handling the real-time events and associated data. The CARES is flexible to cope with different auction mechanisms and processes with high re-configurability. A system prototype is also validated through physical emulations. Experiment results show that the CARES could well schedule the tasks for each robot to minimize its waiting time. The total execution time is reduced by 33 % on average. Space utilization for each auction studio is improved by 50 % approximately. The fourth scenario verifies and validates the proposed platform technologies with real-time methods (i. e., auction planning, scheduling and execution control) via a case study. The near-life pilot implementation examines how the system is able to facilitate the auction activities and decision-making procedures. Lessons and insights from quantitative and qualitative aspects are also discussed. In this research, real-time planning, scheduling and execution control in auction logistics are investigated. The related operation mechanisms and platform technologies are developed accordingly. This comprehensive study of auction logistics is of great value not only to researchers who desire to extend their research into this new area, but also to practitioners who are interested in examining the impacts of logistics factors on operation performance of perishable goods auction. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|E
40|$|The {{supply chain}} {{management}} for an online retailing business is centered around the operations of its fulfillment centers. A fulfillment center receives and holds inventory from vendors, and then uses this inventory to fill customer orders. Our research focuses on a new operating architecture of an order fulfillment system, enabled by new technology. We {{refer to it as}} the Semi-automated Fulfillment System. Different from the person-to-goods model in traditional warehouses, the semi-automated fulfillment system adopts a <b>goods-to-person</b> model for stowing and picking items from a storage field. In a semi-automated fulfillment system the inventory is stored on mobile storage pods; those mobile pods are then carried by robotic drives to static stations at which the operators conduct pick or stow operations. In the first chapter, we describe and identify three key operational decisions in the semiautomated fulfillment system, namely from which pods to pick the inventory needed (picking decision), where to return the pod to the storage field upon the completion of a pick or stow operation (storage decision), and to which pods to replenish the received inventory (stowage decision). We present a high-level capacity planning model for determining the number of robotic drives needed to achieve a given throughput level. This model highlights how the operational efficiency in this system depends on two key parameters, namely the travel time for an entire drive trip and the number of unit picks or stows per pod trip. In the second chapter, we focus on the storage decisions. The storage decision is to decide to which storage location to return a pod upon the completion of a pick or stow operation. We extend the academic results on the benefits of adopting velocity-based and class-based storage policies to the context of the semi-automated fulfillment system. We associate with each storage pod a velocity measure that represents an expectation of the number of picks from that pod in the near future. We then show that by assigning the high velocity pods to the most desirable storage locations, we can significantly reduce the drive travel time, compared to the random storage policy that returns the pod to a randomly-chosen storage location. We show that class-based storage policies with two or three classes, can achieve most of the benefits from the idealized velocity-based policy. Furthermore, we characterize how the performance of the velocity-based and class-based storage policies depend on the velocity variability across the storage pods; in particular we model how the benefits from velocity-based storage policies increase with increased variation in the pod velocities. In the third chapter, we build a discrete-time simulator to validate the theoretical models in the second chapter with real industry data. We observe a 6 % to 11 % reduction in the travel distance with 2 -class or 3 -class system, depending on the parameter settings. From a sensitivity analysis we establish the robustness of the class-based storage policies as they continue to perform well under a broad range of warehouse settings including different zoning strategies, resource utilization levels and space utilization levels. In the fourth chapter, we examine two stowage decisions, one at the zone level and the other at the pod level. The zone-level decision is to decide how to allocate the received inventory to multiple storage zones. The objective is to assure that the resulting picking workload for each zone is within its capacity. We show by simulation that a chaining-based allocation can be effective to balance the picking workload across different storage zones. The pod-level stowage decision is to decide on which pods to stow the inventory. We formulate a mixedinteger program (MIP) to find the optimal stowage profile that maximizes the number of unit picks per pod trip. We solve the MIP for a set of test cases to gain insight into the structure of optimal stowage policy. Motivated by these insights, we further propose a class-based stowage process that induces variability across the pod velocities. by Rong Yuan. Thesis: Ph.
