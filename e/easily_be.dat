5|$|Although {{conclusive}} evidence might be wanting either way for whether Hebrew Law allowed for impalement, or just hanging, the Neo-Assyrian method of impalement {{as seen in}} the carvings could, perhaps, equally <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> seen as a form of hanging upon a pole, rather than focusing upon the stake's actual penetration of the body.|$|E
5|$|Although sodium is less {{reactive}} than potassium, {{this process}} works because at such high temperatures potassium is more volatile than sodium and can <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> distilled off, {{so that the}} equilibrium shifts towards the right to produce more potassium gas and proceeds almost to completion.|$|E

5|$|Cold {{seawater}} {{is used in}} the Seawater Greenhouse to both {{cool and}} humidify the interior of greenhouse-like structure.

Due to differences in the competition's structure over time, NK Maribor competed in both the Yugoslav Cup and the Slovenian Cup, performances cannot <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> compared, and are therefore not available for sorting.|$|E
5|$|Humpbacks can <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> {{identified}} by their stocky body, obvious hump, black dorsal coloring and elongated pectoral fins. The head and lower jaw {{are covered with}} knobs called tubercles, which are hair follicles and are characteristic of the species. The fluked tail, which typically rises above the surface when diving, has wavy trailing edges.|$|E

5|$|Subdivision rules can <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> {{generalized}} to other dimensions. For instance, barycentric subdivision {{is used in}} all dimensions. Also, binary subdivision can be {{generalized to}} other dimensions (where hypercubes get divided by every midplane), as in the proof of the Heine–Borel theorem.|$|E
5|$|The {{population}} is, however, gradually decreasing due to habitat loss, {{caused by}} expanding human settlements and poaching for its superior meat. As they are docile and inactive {{most of the}} time, they can <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> killed. The species became extinct in Swaziland and Zimbabwe, but has been reintroduced.|$|E
5|$|They soon {{reverted to}} state ownership. The Colorado Highway Commission {{used them to}} realize plans it had made a decade earlier, when it first {{designated}} the future Highway 82 through the Roaring Fork Valley. With the Midland's tracks unused, it now had a graded route that could <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> adapted for highway purposes.|$|E

5|$|A paper {{documenting the}} {{discovery}} was {{prepared by the}} team {{and sent to the}} journal Physical Review in March 1941, but publication was delayed until a year after the end of World War II due to security concerns. At the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge, Egon Bretscher and Norman Feather realized that a slow neutron reactor fuelled with uranium would theoretically produce substantial amounts of plutonium-239 as a by-product. They calculated that element 94 would be fissile, and had the added advantage of being chemically different from uranium, and could <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> separated from it.|$|E
5|$|A {{total of}} 80 {{percent of the}} Abrahams Creek {{watershed}} is rural and 20 percent is urbanized. The lower reaches of the watershed contain most of the urbanization. Its upper reaches contain second-growth forest, small patches of residential land, linear hedgerows, and agricultural land such as hay pastures, pastures, and farmland. The Bunker Hill-Mount Lookout Ridge is too steep to be developed, but many {{other areas of the}} watershed could <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> urbanized. The mining-affected land in the watershed is in West Wyoming.|$|E
5|$|Andrée gave a glowingly optimistic {{account of}} {{the ease with which}} these {{requirements}} could be met. Larger balloons had been constructed in France, he claimed, and more airtight, too. Some French balloons had remained hydrogen-filled for over a year without appreciable loss of buoyancy. As for the hydrogen, filling the balloon at the launch site could <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> done with the help of mobile hydrogen manufacturing units; for the steering he referred to his own drag-rope experiments with the Svea, stating that a deviation of 27degrees from the wind direction could be routinely achieved.|$|E

5|$|As a group, {{the house}} martins cannot <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> {{confused}} {{with any other}} swallows. Four species of the genus Tachycineta have white rumps and underparts, but they have bright metallic green or blue-green upperparts, longer tails, and are restricted to Central and South America. The variable plumages of the South Asian species and a confused taxonomic history has left their distribution ranges in doubt.|$|E
5|$|Cirque du Soleil shows {{normally}} tour under a grand chapiteau (i.e. big top) for {{an extended}} period of time until they are modified, if necessary, for touring in arenas and other venues.

5|$|Edward built further luxurious, {{self-contained}} lodgings for {{his court}} around {{the east and}} south edges of the Upper Ward, creating the modern shape of the quadrangle. The Norman gate was built to secure the west entrance to the Ward. In the Lower Ward, the chapel was enlarged and remodelled with grand buildings for the canons built alongside. The earliest weight-driven mechanical clock in England was installed by Edward III in the Round Tower in 1354. William of Wykeham went on to build New College, Oxford and Winchester College, where the influence of Windsor Castle can <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> seen.|$|E

5|$|Especially in warmer areas, {{the house}} sparrow may build its nests in the open, on the {{branches}} of trees, especially evergreens and hawthorns, or in the nests of large birds such as storks or magpies. In open nesting sites, breeding success tends to be lower, since breeding begins late and the nest can <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> destroyed or damaged by storms. Less common nesting sites include street lights and neon signs, favoured for their warmth; and the old open-topped nests of other songbirds, which are then domed over.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to its earlier place amongst the wealthy, during the 17th and 18th centuries, the pasty became popular with working people in Cornwall, where tin miners and others adopted it {{due to its}} unique shape, forming a complete meal that could be carried easily and eaten without cutlery. In a mine, the pasty's dense, folded pastry could stay warm for several hours, and if it did get cold, it could <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> warmed on a shovel over a candle.|$|E
5|$|Inside No. 9 is an {{anthology}} series, with each episode featuring a new story, {{with a new}} setting and new characters. Episodes last around half an hour, with the self-contained story reaching a conclusion. The stories are linked only {{by the fact that}} each takes place in number 9, be that a mansion, a dressing room or a flat. Every episode stars at least one of Shearsmith or Pemberton, and normally both. Each episode is effectively a short play, and could <b>easily</b> <b>be</b> performed on stage. Most episodes take place in real-time, following half an hour {{in the lives of the}} characters.|$|E
