5|$|The censors thus {{expanded}} their jurisdiction {{from what was}} seen to what was <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> spectator's mind. In The Office Wife (1930), several of Joan Blondell's disrobing maneuvers were strictly forbidden and the implied image of the actress being naked just off-screen was deemed too suggestive even though it relied upon the audience using their imaginations, so post-Code releases of the film had scenes which were blurred or rendered indistinct, if allowed at all.|$|E
5|$|Plutarch cites Aeschines Socraticus, {{who wrote}} a {{dialogue}} on Aspasia (now lost), {{to the effect that}} after Pericles's death, Aspasia lived with Lysicles, an Athenian strategos (general) and democratic leader, with whom she had another son; and that she made him the first man at Athens. Lysicles was killed on expedition to levy subsidies from allies in action in 428 BC With Lysicles' death the contemporaneous record ends. It is unknown, if she was alive when her son, Pericles, was elected general or when he was executed after the Battle of Arginusae. The time of her death that most historians give (c. 401 BC-400 BC) is based on the assessment that Aspasia died before the execution of Socrates in 399 BC, a chronology which is <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> structure of Aeschines' Aspasia.|$|E
5|$|The treaty {{recognised}} Scotland as {{an independent}} kingdom. It stipulated that Robert was to pay 40,000 marks to the English, and that Edward {{should be allowed to}} choose a wife from his own family for Robert's heir. <b>Implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> text, however, was an alliance between Robert and Harclay to use force against Edward, if necessary, to implement the terms of the treaty. It seems unlikely that Harclay expected royal clemency for his actions. More likely he contemplated a defection to the side of Robert the Bruce; rumour had it he even planned marrying one of Bruce's daughters. It is nevertheless likely that his action grew out of genuine concern with the northern situation, and was a desperate attempt to make the best out of a difficult situation.|$|E

5|$|Eusebius' {{first version}} of the Chronicon was written in 303, and his second in the mid-320s; Jerome's revision, {{translation}} and continuation dates to 380. The original Greek is lost; it is largely through Jerome's Latin and through an Armenian translation unrelated to Jerome that {{the substance of the}} original survives. Eusebius' original did cover Philip's rule—Jerome's continuation of the Chronicon only covers the period from 325 to 378—but the sections regarding Philip's Christianity do not survive in the Armenian translation. In the Armenian, all references to Arabs are omitted. Philip's celebration of the millennium is preserved, while his supposed Christianity is only <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> entry on Decius' persecution. Jerome's Chronicon is, therefore, the nearest we can get to Eusebius' early statements on Philip's Christianity. That Jerome calls Philip primus in the Chronicon thus admits of two interpretations: either he found it in Eusebius, or he added it independently, based on other sources available to him. Shahîd argues that, while the text would offer a strong case for Philip's Christianity either way, the former interpretation is more plausible. Shahîd believes that primus appeared in Eusebius {{first version of}} the Chronicon, but may have been edited out for the second version—by the mid 320s, Eusebius had become Constantine's panegyrist, and was understandably loath to praise his subject's ignoble predecessors.|$|E

25|$|The {{question}} concerning corporeity connects {{also with}} Merleau-Ponty's reflections on space (l'espace) and {{the primacy of}} the dimension of depth (la profondeur) as <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> notion of being in the world (être au monde; to echo Heidegger's In-der-Welt-sein) and of one's own body (le corps propre).|$|E
25|$|Rafinesque {{introduced}} the name Nymphalia as a subfamily name in diurnal Lepidoptera.

25|$|The {{execution}} is dramatised in the 2005 film Pierrepoint, {{in which}} Waddingham {{is played by}} Elizabeth Hopley. Although the film shows Timothy Spall as Albert Pierrepoint carrying out the execution, in fact the hangman was Thomas Pierrepoint (Albert's uncle); Albert acted as his uncle's assistant. Furthermore, the execution took place at Birmingham's Winson Green prison, not Holloway Prison in London as is <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. The film is also incorrect in that it depicts the execution taking place during the war years.|$|E
25|$|In {{an article}} {{published}} in 1996, physician-epidemiologist John S.

Their explanation also accounted for the apparent selectiveness of the plagues, as <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bible.

25|$|The {{question}} of romance is sometimes sidestepped with plot devices in the spin-off media.

Miranda returns in the novel Sometime Never... by Justin Richards, with her own daughter Zezanne. At that novel's end, a time-active being called Soul travels into the past accompanied by Zezanne, the two believing themselves to be the Doctor and Susan, respectively.|$|E

Both of them are depressed by the demolition of so many of the landmarks of their youth, though Bob, who works for a building firm, sometimes sees it as progress. Bob has also bought his own house on a newly-built estate, further distancing him from his and Terry's pasts.|$|E
25|$|As is <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{title of}} the book, two {{elements}} mark the thesis of Being and Event: the place of ontology, or 'the science of being qua being' (being in itself), and {{the place of the}} event – which is seen as a rupture in being – through which the subject finds realization and reconciliation with truth. This situation of being and the rupture which characterizes the event are thought in terms of set theory, and specifically Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (with the axiom of choice), to which Badiou accords a fundamental role in a manner quite distinct from the majority of either mathematicians or philosophers.|$|E
25|$|The Winters court {{reasoned}} that water rights were <b>implied</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> agreement {{that had been}} made with the American Indians in 1888, when the reservation was created. This agreement stated that the Fort Belknap Reservation had been created with the intention of the tribal people being able to become self-sufficient. The court noted that land without water has no value, especially when the purpose of a land was to help a group become self-supporting in the way of agriculture. Therefore, a reservation of water goes along with the reservation of the land. Water rights may be implied from American Indian reservations made by presidential executive order, or American Indian reservations which are created by an act of Congress. Other implications of this court case include setting more of a standard for American Indian water rights along with setting a precedent for later Supreme Court cases which deal with implied water rights.|$|E
