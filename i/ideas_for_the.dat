50|$|According to {{writer and}} {{director}} Iguchi, <b>the</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Machine Girl went back to a simple idea he had about a one-armed girl in a bikini looking <b>for</b> revenge. <b>The</b> <b>idea</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> machine gun arm came later.|$|R

Abrams later brought Bryan Burk, a producer on several of his films, to help with developing the series.|$|E
5|$|Conditions in Biafra worsened {{as the war}} continued. In September 1968, {{the city}} of Aba fell to the Nigerian {{military}} and Achebe once again moved his family, this time to Umuahia, where the Biafran government had also relocated. He was chosen to chair the newly formed National Guidance Committee, charged {{with the task of}} drafting principles and <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> post-war era.

5|$|Early <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> Downward Spiral were {{conceived}} after the Lollapalooza 1991 festival concerts ended in September of that year. Reznor developed a concept about the album's themes and later {{used it as}} lyrics. He searched for and moved to 10050 Cielo Drive, renting it for $11,000 per month from July 4, 1992, marking {{the beginning of the}} making of both Broken and The Downward Spiral. This was against his initial choice to record the album in New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Ernest C. Wong of Site Design Group {{designed}} the park. Having designed landscape along Chinatown's Cermak Avenue, Wong {{was familiar with}} the community and invited the public to voice their opinions and <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> future park. The park's original design called for walled plazas inspired by traditional Chinese gardens in Suzhou, China. This design was scrapped, however, because of security and vandalism concerns. Instead, a system of pathways was created to link defined spaces and mimic courtyards.|$|E
5|$|Hoshino {{commented that}} most of her <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> series come after falling asleep in the bath for six hours.

5|$|Many of the <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> series {{originated}} in an unpublished educational comic book titled The Intertidal Zone, which Hillenburg created in 1989. He began developing SpongeBob SquarePants into a television series in 1996 upon {{the cancellation of}} Rocko's Modern Life, and turned to Tom Kenny, {{who had worked with}} him on that series, to voice the title character. SpongeBob was originally going to be named SpongeBoy, and the series was to be called SpongeBoy Ahoy!, but both of these were changed, as the name was already trademarked.|$|E
5|$|Proposed {{uses for}} the land {{included}} a soccer stadium, an indoor tennis facility for Belmont University, public tennis courts, rodeo grounds, a Kroger grocery store, and a neighborhood park. In {{a letter to the}} editor of The Tennessean, former Sounds owner Larry Schmittou expressed his interest in Greer becoming an amateur baseball park, citing its amenities and several Metro high schools that lack baseball diamonds of their own. Two public meetings were held in September 2016 to discuss these and other proposals and <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> space.|$|E
5|$|The Brownsea Island Scout camp {{began as}} a boys' camping event on Brownsea Island in Poole Harbour, {{southern}} England, organised by Lieutenant-General Baden-Powell to test his <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> book Scouting for Boys.

5|$|The group {{remembered the}} {{recording}} being a happy process, {{with a strong}} feeling of camaraderie and fun, with numerous practical jokes. They were fans of Python, and this style of humour influenced the lyrics and overall concept. Guitarist Martin Barre recalls the whole band coming up with various <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> music. Some parts were recorded in a single take with every member having an input, including significant contributions from keyboardist John Evan.|$|E
5|$|Darryl Philbin (Craig Robinson) {{has been}} {{promoted}} to Assistant Regional Manager {{and as a result}} is inspired to find ways to be more productive, for himself and the office. However, his <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> office are ignored by Andy, leading to a discussion with Jim in the warehouse about their increasing dissatisfaction with Dunder Mifflin. Jim tells Darryl about his sports marketing job opportunity in Philadelphia and offers him a possible position. However, as Jim has yet to tell Pam, Darryl says he should before going forward. When Pam comes back, Jim reveals the job opportunity to Pam, who, despite giving her approval, is upset that Jim did not consult her beforehand.|$|E
5|$|Docter {{recruited}} a story crew to {{help develop}} the film's plot line. Although animation as an industry had been dominated by men, half of the story crew were women, {{in an attempt to}} have more diverse input. The choice to focus the film on a girl came from research that claimed that females age 11 to 17 are more attuned to expressions and emotions than others. The idea to have Riley play hockey came from Del Carmen, who observed that the sport is very popular in Minnesota. They tried to stray away from stereotypically feminine interests, such as the color pink or dresses. Initial <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> film found the main character, Riley, falling into a deep depression: Docter later felt they were inappropriate and scrapped them, although in the final film Riley does sink into a depression.|$|E

5|$|Following {{the success}} of the 1981 title Defender, Williams searched for new {{creative}} staff. Believing video games to be the future of entertainment, Newcomer left his job as a toy designer to work at the company who hired him to create game ideas as support for development staff. After a few days, he generated a list of ideas that included game <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>The</b> War of the Worlds and Joust, Newcomer's top two choices. Technical specifications dictated the selection; Newcomer's vision of The War of the Worlds was infeasible, but Joust could be accomplished with Williams' available hardware. A development team was formed, which decided to create the game using Defenders hardware.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{receives}} a text from Robert California (James Spader) inviting {{him on the}} trip to Tallahassee. After unsuccessfully trying to back out via text, Jim and Pam both agree Jim should just go. During Jim's request session with Andy and Dwight, Jim shows the texts from California, shocking both Andy and Dwight, making it all but official that Jim {{will be going to}} Tallahassee. The final team includes Cathy, Ryan Howard (B. J. Novak), Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker), Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) and Jim, infuriating Dwight. At first he tries to convince the members to change their minds, but after realizing they all have excellent <b>ideas</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> project, he is content with the team.|$|E
