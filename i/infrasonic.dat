5|$|Like other whales, males make long, loud, low-{{frequency}} sounds. The vocalizations of {{blue and}} fin whales are the lowest-frequency sounds made by any animal. Most sounds are frequency-modulated (FM) down-swept <b>infrasonic</b> pulses from 16 to 40hertz frequency (the range of sounds that most humans can hear falls between 20hertz and 20kilohertz). Each sound lasts one to two seconds, and various sound combinations occur in patterned sequences lasting 7 to 15 minutes each. The whale then repeats the sequences in bouts lasting up to many days. The vocal sequences have source levels of up to 184–186decibels relative to 1micropascal at a reference distance of one metre and can be detected {{hundreds of miles from}} their source.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} such sound waves is {{sometimes}} referred to as <b>infrasonics,</b> covering sounds beneath 20Hz down to 0.1Hz and rarely to 0.001Hz. People use this frequency range for monitoring earthquakes, charting rock and petroleum formations below the earth, and also in ballistocardiography and seismocardiography to study the mechanics of the heart.|$|R
5000|$|Later, a {{pig farmer}} and avid field {{recorder}} - the [...] "Sampler" [...] - draws Kris to his farm using <b>infrasonics,</b> which attracts the worm. The Sampler silently {{sets up a}} transfusion through which he transfers the worm from Kris's body into that of a young pig. Kris then awakens in an abandoned SUV on the freeway with no memory of these recent traumatic events. Upon arriving at her disordered house, she quizzically notices blood on her sheets and floors and considers calling the police. She realizes she has no information to tell them and stops dialing. After cleaning up, she heads to work where she is promptly fired for her unexplained absence. A trip {{to the grocery store}} reveals to Kris that her personal funds are gone, evidently stolen by the Thief.|$|R
40|$|The {{underground}} {{nuclear tests}} by the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) generated atmospheric infrasound both in 2013 and 2016. Clear detections {{were made in}} the Russian Federation (I 45 RU) and Japan (I 30 JP) in 2013 at stations from the International Monitoring System. Both tropospheric and stratospheric refractions arrived at the stations. In 2016, only a weak return was potentially observed at I 45 RU. Data analysis and propagation modeling show that the noise level at the stations and the stratospheric circumpolar vortex were different in 2016 compared to 2013. As the seismic magnitude of the 2013 and 2016 nuclear test explosions was comparable, we hypothesize that the 2016 test occurred at least 1. 5 times deeper. In such a case, less seismic energy would couple through the lithosphere-atmosphere interface, leading to less observable infrasound. Since explosion depth is difficult to estimate from seismic data alone, this motivates a synergy between seismics and <b>infrasonics.</b> </p...|$|R
5|$|While most vocals are audible to {{the human}} ear, a captive leopard seal was {{recorded}} making ultrasonic calls underwater. In addition, the vocals of northern elephant seals may produce <b>infrasonic</b> vibrations. Non-vocal communication is not as common in pinnipeds as in cetaceans. Nevertheless, when disturbed by intruders harbor seals and Baikal seals may slap their fore-flippers against their bodies as warnings. Teeth chattering, hisses and exhalations are also made as aggressive warnings. Visual displays also occur: Weddell seals will make an S-shaped posture when patrolling under the ice, and Ross seals will display the stripes on their chests and teeth when approached. Male hooded seals use their inflatable nasal membranes to display to and attract females.|$|E
5|$|Vocalisations are {{frequent}} as the juveniles disperse, {{and again as}} they congregate in the morning. Nearby adults, presumably the parents, also give signals warning of predators or alerting the youngsters {{to the presence of}} food. The range and quantity of vocalisations vary between species. Alligators are the noisiest, while some crocodile species are almost completely silent. Adult female New Guinea crocodiles and Siamese crocodiles roar when approached by another adult, while Nile crocodiles grunt or bellow in a similar situation. The American alligator is exceptionally noisy; it emits a series of about seven throaty bellows, each a couple of seconds long, at ten second intervals. It also makes various grunts and hisses. Males create vibrations in the water to send out <b>infrasonic</b> signals that serve to attract females and intimidate rivals. The enlarged boss of the male gharial may serve as a sound resonator.|$|E
25|$|Natural events: <b>infrasonic</b> sound {{sometimes}} results naturally {{from severe}} weather, surf, lee waves, avalanches, earthquakes, volcanoes, bolides, waterfalls, calving of icebergs, aurorae, meteors, lightning and upper-atmospheric lightning. Nonlinear ocean wave interactions in ocean storms produce pervasive infrasound vibrations around 0.2Hz, known as microbaroms. According to the Infrasonics Program at NOAA, <b>infrasonic</b> arrays {{can be used}} to locate avalanches in the Rocky Mountains, and to detect tornadoes on the high plains several minutes before they touch down.|$|E
50|$|The hot-wire {{microphone}} was {{often used as}} an acoustic detector, especially for infrasound. It was invented {{around the time of}} the First World War for use in acoustic artillery ranging, and an improved model was developed by Tucker and Paris Trans. Roy. Soc. A221, 390 (1921) and is described in Wood, pp. 303-305. It consists of a grid of fine platinum wire suspended in a hole in a mica disc closing the mouth of a Helmholtz resonator. A current is passed through the wire to heat it, while its resistance is measured with a Wheatstone bridge. The periodic air currents established when a signal is received cool the wire (at twice the frequency of vibration) and change its resistance. It is very useful for <b>infrasonics,</b> where impedance matching is more important than speed. The {{hot-wire microphone}} has no diaphragm to add inertia. It is useful for frequencies as high as 512 Hz, and is quite sensitive. Hot-wire microphones were often used in long-distance sound investigations.|$|R
25|$|Animals {{have been}} known to {{perceive}} the <b>infrasonic</b> waves going through the earth by natural disasters and can use these as an early warning. A recent example of this is the 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake and tsunami. Animals were reported to flee the area hours before the actual tsunami hit the shores of Asia. It is not known for sure that this is the cause; some have suggested that {{it may have been the}} influence of electromagnetic waves, and not of <b>infrasonic</b> waves, that prompted these animals to flee.|$|E
25|$|The {{frequencies}} of sonars range from <b>infrasonic</b> to above a megahertz. Generally, the lower frequencies have longer range, while the higher {{frequencies of}}fer better resolution, and smaller size {{for a given}} directionality.|$|E
25|$|NASA Langley has {{designed}} and developed an <b>infrasonic</b> detection {{system that can}} be used to make useful infrasound measurements at a location where it was not possible previously. The system comprises an electret condenser microphone PCB Model 377M06, having a 3-inch membrane diameter, and a small, compact windscreen. Electret-based technology offers the lowest possible background noise, because Johnson noise generated in the supporting electronics (preamplifier) is minimized.|$|E
25|$|The Feraliminal Lycanthropizer is {{a fictional}} machine invented by American writer David Woodard, whose 1990 {{pamphlet}} {{of the same}} title speculates on its history and purpose. The brief, anonymously published work describes a vibration referred to as thanato-auric waves, which the machine electrically generates by combining three <b>infrasonic</b> sine waves (3Hz, 9Hz and 0.56Hz) with concomitant tape loops of unspecified spoken text (two beyond the threshold of decipherability, and two beneath the threshold).|$|E
500|$|Elephants produce several sounds, usually {{through the}} larynx, though {{some may be}} {{modified}} by the trunk. Perhaps the most well known call is the trumpet which is made by blowing through the trunk. Trumpeting is made during excitement, distress or aggression. Fighting elephants may roar or squeal, and wounded ones may bellow. Rumbles are produced during mild arousal and some appear to be <b>infrasonic.</b> <b>Infrasonic</b> calls are important, particularly for long-distance communication, in both Asian and African elephants. For Asian elephants, these calls have a frequency of 14–24Hz, with sound pressure levels of 85–90dB and last 10–15 seconds. For African elephants, calls range from 15–35Hz with sound pressure levels as high as 117dB, allowing communication for many kilometres, with a possible maximum range of around [...]|$|E
500|$|The [...] {{has four}} inputs {{that can be}} {{switched}} via the front panel– Aux, Tuner, Phono, Tape. The manufacturer claims the phono input, which {{can also be used}} with high-output moving coil cartridges, contains a 6-transistor circuit [...] "engineered for extremely low noise and nearly distortion-free performance". Reviewers note the pre-amplifier's [...] "decent moving-magnet phono stage". The amplifier is bandwidth-limited, incorporating <b>infrasonic</b> and ultrasonic filters to supposedly reduce the effects of non-musical signals such as acoustic feedback, disc warps and electromagnetic interference on the musical signals.|$|E
500|$|At Amboseli, several {{different}} <b>infrasonic</b> calls have been identified. A greeting rumble is emitted {{by members of}} a family group after having been separated for several hours. Contact calls are soft, unmodulated sounds made by individuals that have been separated from their group and may be responded to with a [...] "contact answer" [...] call that starts out loud, but becomes softer. A [...] "let's go" [...] soft rumble is emitted by the matriarch to signal to the other herd members {{that it is time}} to move to another spot. Bulls in musth emit a distinctive, low-frequency pulsated rumble nicknamed the [...] "motorcycle". Musth rumbles may be answered by the [...] "female chorus", a low-frequency, modulated chorus produced by several cows. A loud postcopulatory call may be made by an oestrous cow after mating. When a cow has mated, her family may produce calls of excitement known as the [...] "mating pandemonium".|$|E
500|$|Since <b>infrasonic</b> bass is felt, sub-bass can be {{augmented}} using tactile transducers. Unlike {{a typical}} subwoofer driver, which produces audible vibrations, tactile transducers produce low-frequency vibrations {{that are designed}} to be felt by individuals who are touching the transducer or indirectly through a piece of furniture or a wooden floor. Tactile transducers have recently emerged as a device class, called variously [...] "bass shakers", [...] "butt shakers" [...] and [...] "throne shakers". They are attached to a seat, for instance a drummer's stool ("throne") or gamer's chair, car seat or home theater seating, and the vibrations of the driver are transmitted to the body then to the ear {{in a manner similar to}} bone conduction. They connect to an amplifier like a normal subwoofer. They can be attached to a large flat surface (for instance a floor or platform) to create a large low frequency conduction area, although the transmission of low frequencies through the feet is not as efficient as the seat.|$|E
500|$|The Matterhorn is a {{subwoofer}} model {{completed in}} March 2007 by Danley Sound Labs in Gainesville, Georgia after a U.S. military {{request for a}} loudspeaker that could project <b>infrasonic</b> waves over a distance. The Matterhorn was designed to reproduce a continuous sine wave from 15 to 20Hz, and generate 94dB {{at a distance of}} , and more than 140dB for music playback measured at the horn mouth. It can generate a constant 15Hz sine wave tone at 140dB for 24 hours a day, seven days a week with extremely low harmonic distortion. The subwoofer has a flat frequency response from 15 to 80Hz, and is down 3dB at 12Hz. It was built within an intermodal container [...] long and [...] square. The container doors swing open to reveal a tapped horn driven by 40 long-throw 15-inch (40cm) MTX speaker drivers each powered by its own 1000-watt amplifier. The manufacturer claims that 53 13-ply 18mm [...] sheets of plywood were used in its construction, though one of the fabricators wrote that double-thickness 26-ply sheets were used for convenience.|$|E
500|$|Many mammals {{communicate}} by vocalizing. Vocal communication serves many purposes, including in mating rituals, as warning calls, to indicate food sources, and for social purposes. Males often call during mating rituals {{to ward off}} other males and to attract females, as in the roaring of lions and red deer. The songs of the humpback whale may be signals to females; they have different dialects in {{different regions of the}} ocean. Social vocalizations include the territorial calls of gibbons, and the use of frequency in greater spear-nosed bats to distinguish between groups. The vervet monkey gives a distinct alarm call for each of at least four different predators, and the reactions of other monkeys vary according to the call. For example, if an alarm call signals a python, the monkeys climb into the trees, whereas the eagle alarm causes monkeys to seek a hiding place on the ground. Prairie dogs similarly have complex calls that signal the type, size, and speed of an approaching predator. Elephants communicate socially with a variety of sounds including snorting, screaming, trumpeting, roaring and rumbling. Some of the rumbling calls are <b>infrasonic,</b> below the hearing range of humans, and can be heard by other elephants up to [...] away at still times near sunrise and sunset.|$|E
500|$|Crocodilians are {{the most}} vocal of all {{reptiles}} and {{have a variety of}} different calls depending on the age, size, and gender of the animal. The American alligator can perform specific vocalizations to declare territory, signal distress, threaten competitors, and locate suitable mates. Juvenile American alligators can perform a high-pitched hatchling call (a [...] "yelping" [...] trait common to many crocodilian species' hatchling young) to alert their mothers when they are ready to emerge from the nest. Juveniles also make a distress call to alert their mothers if they are being threatened. Although American alligators have vocal cords, they function differently from those of mammals. Both males and females bellow loudly to attract mates and declare territory by sucking air into their lungs and blowing it out in intermittent, deep-toned roars. The bellowing of the American alligator is distinct from the loud roaring of most crocodilians, and is considered unique. Male American alligators are known to use infrasound during mating bellows. Bellowing is performed in a [...] "head oblique, tail arched" [...] posture. <b>Infrasonic</b> waves from a bellowing male American alligator can cause {{the surface of the water}} directly over and to either side of its back to literally [...] "sprinkle", in what is commonly called the [...] "water dance". Large bellowing [...] "choruses" [...] of American alligators during the breeding season are commonly initiated by females and perpetuated by males. Observers of large bellowing choruses have noted they are often felt more than they are heard due to the intense infrasound emitted by males. American alligators bellow in B flat (specifically [...] "B♭1", defined as an audio frequency of 58.27Hz), and bellowing choruses can be induced by tuba players, sonic booms, and large aircraft. [...] In addition to bellowing, American alligators can growl, hiss, or cough to threaten others and declare territory.|$|E
2500|$|The Allies of World War I {{first used}} {{infrasound}} to locate artillery. One {{of the pioneers}} in <b>infrasonic</b> research was French scientist Vladimir Gavreau. His interest in <b>infrasonic</b> waves first came about in his laboratory during the 1960s, {{when he and his}} laboratory assistants experienced [...] shaking laboratory equipment and pain in the eardrums, but his microphones did not detect audible sound. He concluded it was infrasound caused by a large fan and duct system, and soon got to work preparing tests in the laboratories. One of his experiments was an <b>infrasonic</b> whistle, an oversized organ pipe.|$|E

2500|$|Psychologist Richard Wiseman of the University of Hertfordshire {{suggests}} that the odd sensations that people attribute to ghosts {{may be caused by}} <b>infrasonic</b> vibrations. Vic Tandy, experimental officer and part-time lecturer in the school of international studies and law at Coventry University, along with Dr. Tony Lawrence of the University's psychology department, wrote in 1998 a paper called [...] "Ghosts in the Machine" [...] for the Journal of the Society for Psychical Research. Their research suggested that an <b>infrasonic</b> signal of 19Hz might be responsible for some ghost sightings. Tandy was working late one night alone in a supposedly haunted laboratory at Warwick, when he felt very anxious and could detect a grey blob {{out of the corner of}} his eye. When Tandy turned to face the grey blob, there was nothing.|$|E

2500|$|On 31 May 2003 a {{group of}} UK {{researchers}} held a mass experiment, where they exposed some 700 people to music laced with soft 17Hz sine waves played at a level described as [...] "near the edge of hearing", produced by an extra-long-stroke subwoofer mounted {{two-thirds of the way}} from the end of a seven-meter-long plastic sewer pipe. The experimental concert (entitled <b>Infrasonic)</b> took place in the Purcell Room over the course of two performances, each consisting of four musical pieces. Two of the pieces in each concert had 17Hz tones played underneath.|$|E
2500|$|Bellowing: Male {{crocodiles}} {{are especially}} vociferous. Bellowing choruses occur {{most often in}} the spring when breeding groups congregate, but can occur {{at any time of}} year. To bellow, males noticeably inflate as they raise the tail and head out of water, slowly waving the tail back and forth. They then puff out the throat and with a closed mouth, begin to vibrate air. Just before bellowing, males project an <b>infrasonic</b> signal at about 10Hz through the water, which vibrates the ground and nearby objects. These low-frequency vibrations travel great distances through both air and water to advertise the male's presence and are so powerful they result in the water's appearing to [...] "dance".|$|E
2500|$|The gain of a {{good quality}} {{full-range}} audio amplifier will be essentially flat between 20Hz to about 20kHz (the range of normal human hearing). In ultra-high-fidelity amplifier design, the amplifier's frequency response should extend considerably beyond this (one or more octaves either side) and might have [...] points < 10nbsp&Hz and > [...] Professional touring amplifiers often have input and/or output filtering to sharply limit frequency response beyond {{too much of the}} amplifier's potential output power would otherwise be wasted on <b>infrasonic</b> and ultrasonic frequencies, and the danger of AM radio interference would increase. Modern switching amplifiers need steep low pass filtering at the output to get rid of high-frequency switching noise and harmonics.|$|E
2500|$|A high-pass (low-cut) and/or {{low-pass}} (high-cut) filter {{may also}} be included on equalizers or audio consoles. High-pass (low-cut) and low-pass (high-cut) filters restrict a given channel's bandwidth extremes. Cutting very low frequency sound signals (termed <b>infrasonic,</b> or subsonic, a misnomer) reduces the waste of amplifier power which does not produce audible sound and which moreover can be hard on the low-range speakers. A low-pass filter to cut ultrasonic energy is useful to prevent interference from radio frequencies, lighting control hum, or digital circuitry creeping into the power amplifiers. Such filters are often included with graphic and parametric equalizers to give the audio engineer full control of the frequency range. [...] If their response is steep enough, high-pass filters and low-pass filters function as end-cut filters. [...] A feedback suppressor is an automatically-adjusted band-reject or notch filter which includes a microprocessor to detect the onset of [...] feedback [...] "howls" [...] and direct the filter to suppress the feedback by lowering the gain right at the offending frequency.|$|E
2500|$|Sonar (originally {{an acronym}} for SOund Navigation And Ranging) is a {{technique}} that uses sound propagation (usually underwater, as in submarine navigation) to navigate, communicate with or detect objects on or {{under the surface of}} the water, such as other vessels. Two types of technology share the name [...] "sonar": passive sonar is essentially listening for the sound made by vessels; active sonar is emitting pulses of sounds and listening for echoes. Sonar may be used as a means of acoustic location and of measurement of the echo characteristics of [...] "targets" [...] in the water. Acoustic location in air was used before the introduction of radar. Sonar may also be used in air for robot navigation, and SODAR (an upward looking in-air sonar) is used for atmospheric investigations. The term sonar is also used for the equipment used to generate and receive the sound. The acoustic frequencies used in sonar systems vary from very low (<b>infrasonic)</b> to extremely high (ultrasonic). The study of underwater sound is known as underwater acoustics or hydroacoustics.|$|E
2500|$|For nearly 60 years, {{the only}} known chaser deaths were driving-related. The first was Christopher Phillips, a University of Oklahoma {{undergraduate}} student, killed in a hydroplaning accident when swerving to miss a rabbit in 1984.

On 31 May 2013, an extreme event led to the first known chaser deaths inflicted directly by weather when the widest tornado ever recorded struck near El Reno, Oklahoma. Engineer Tim Samaras, his photographer son Paul, and meteorologist Carl Young were killed doing in situ probe and <b>infrasonic</b> field research by an exceptional combination of events in which an already large and rain-obscured tornado swelled within {{less than a minute}} to [...] wide simultaneously as it changed direction and accelerated. Several other chasers were also struck and some injured by this tornado and its parent supercell's rear flank downdraft. Three chasers were killed, two in one vehicle and one in another, when their vehicles collided in West Texas in 2017, bringing the total number of known traffic related fatalities to 7. There are other incidents in which chasers were injured by automobile accidents, lightning strikes, and tornado impacts.
