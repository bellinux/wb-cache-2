40|$|Most of the cultivars of Pisum sativum {{resistant}} to bean yellow mosaic virus (BYMV) {{were found to}} be {{resistant to}} clover yellow vein virus (CYVV). However, some accessions from Ethiopia (PI 193586 and PI 193835) and India (PI 347464, PI 347465, PI 347466, PI 347467, and PI 347492) were resistant to CYVV, but susceptible to BYMV. Conversely, others from China (PI 391630) and the USSR (PI 262818) were resistant to BYMV, but susceptible to CYVV, indicating that resistance to these two viruses is conferred by distinct <b>genetic</b> <b>entitles.</b> In the BYMV+CYVV-resistant cultivar Bonneville, resistance to CYVV was found to be inherited monogenlcally recessive (cyv). This gene appears to be closely linked to that conferring resistance to BYMV (mo), which is located on the second chromosome. In the accessions from Ethiopia and India, resistance to CYVV is conditioned by a second recessive gene (cyv- 2), that is situated in a different linkage group. In the lines from China and the USSR, resistance to BYMV is conferred by mo. The possible origin of two distinct genes for resistance to the same isolate of CYVV is discusse...|$|E

There are several other taxonomically unclear examples that belong in the same species complex, such as yellow-legged gull (L. michahellis), glaucous gull (L. hyperboreus), and Caspian gull (L. cachinnans).|$|R

Dr. New continues to study three monogenic disorders: 21-hydroxylase deficiency, 11β-hydroxylase deficiency, and apparent mineralocorticoid excess, emphasizing genotype/phenotype correlation and prenatal diagnosis and treatment. She has published more than 640 academic articles {{in a wide range}} of prestigious journals and published a genetics book <b>entitled</b> <b>Genetic</b> Steroid Disorders in 2014. She has also received numerous awards recognizing her work treating mothers and children affected with the disorder.|$|R

The desirability of initiating population screening programs {{is an example of}} one such issue that has engendered considerable confusion concerning is intent – {{so much so that the}} National Academy of Sciences recently reviewed this subject and in 1975 published a book <b>entitled,</b> <b>Genetic</b> Screening – Programs, Principles and Research. This presentation will describe the four major forms of population screening for genetic disease and, from the Virginia experience with some of them, demonstrate their strengths and shortcomings...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. A new {{technique}} is presented for automatic inversion of SP anomalies {{due to a}} polarized infinitely conductive simple geometrical source model structures, based on an artificial intelligence search strategy <b>entitled</b> <b>genetic</b> algorithm (GA) and the evolution theory. The genetic algorithm is used to find the minimum of fitness or cost func-tion of the unknown depth, polarization angle, and shape factor. The study of synthetic examples shows fast and stable recovery of the true parameters even if the input data contain different percentages of noise. The GA leads to very realistic values for the inverted parameters in all tested examples and the root-mean squared error (rms) between the true and inverted field is accepted. The technique is further applied to real examples from Germany and Turkey...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe data {{presented}} here {{are related to}} the research article, <b>entitled</b> <b>Genetic</b> analysis of atherosclerosis identifies a major susceptibility locus in the major histocompatibility complex of mice, published in Atherosclerosis 2016; 254 : 124 (A. T. Grainger, M. B. Jones, J. Li, M. H. Chen, A. Manichaikul, W. Shi, 2016) [1]. The supporting materials include original genotypic and phenotypic data obtained from 206 female F 2 mice derived from an intercross between BALB and SMJ inbred mice. The F 2 mice were fed 12 weeks of Western diet, starting at 6 weeks of age. Atherosclerotic lesion size in the aortic root of each mouse is the sum of the top 8 lesion areas. The data is provided in the format required for determining QTLs using two independent programs, J/QTL and PLINK...|$|R
40|$|The {{past year}} in {{bioethics}} in Australia {{has been relatively}} predictable. We continue to struggle with rising healthcare costs, though thankfully not on par with numerous other countries due to a relatively positive economic outlook. We are still fighting difficulties associated with higher medical indemnity costs, which have again caused many physicians to leave private practice, particularly in high-risk and specialty practice areas. In response, the federal government (following a shuffle of ministerial positions including that of the federal health minister) delayed the imposition of the medical indemnity levy for physicians until mid 2005. In May, the Australian Law Reform Commission and the Australian Health Ethics Commission issued their final joint report on <b>genetic</b> testing <b>entitled</b> “Essentially Yours” and endorsed use of genetic tests by insurance companies, despite the concerns of some geneticists and {{many members of the}} public about their scientific reliability. However, they also advocated the establishment of the Human Genetics Commission of Australia (HGCA) to oversee such uses of genetic tests in terms of both scientific and actuarial reliability, and debates continue over the implementation of this and a number of their other recommendations. And state governments continue to phase in smoking bans in public places, with most implementing full bans in enclosed restaurants and cafes and planning to require provision of nonsmoking areas in all pubs within the next year.

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a novel sampling method for obtaining core collections, <b>entitled</b> <b>genetic</b> distance sampling. The method incorporates information about distances between individual accessions into a random sampling procedure. A basic {{feature of the}} method is that automatically larger samples are obtained if accessions are further apart and smaller samples if accessions are closer together. Genetic distance sampling {{can be used in}} conjunction with predefined stratifications of the accessions. Sample sizes are determined automatically; they depend on the distances between accessions within strata. The method is applied to the collection of cultivated lettuce of the Centre for Genetic Resources, the Netherlands. In this paper, genetic distances between accessions are obtained using AFLP marker data. However, genetic distance sampling can be applied using any measure of genetic distance between accessions. Some properties of genetic distance sampling are discusse...|$|R
40|$|A new genetic-algorithm-b ased {{system is}} {{presented}} {{and applied to}} the task of predicting the future performances of individual stocks. The system, in its most general form, can be applied to any inductive machine-learning problem: given a database of examples, the system will return a general description applicable to examples both within and outside the database. This differs from traditional genetic algorithms, which perform optimization. The genetic algorithm system is compared to an established neural network system in the domain of financial forecasting, using the results from over 1600 stocks and roughly 5000 experiments. Synergy between the two systems is also examined. This study presents a new system that utilizes genetic algorithms (GAs) to predict the future performances of individual stocks. More generally, the system extends GAs from their traditional domain of optimization to inductive machine learning or classification. The overall learning system incorporates a GA, a niching method (for finding multiple solutions), and several other components (discussed in the section <b>entitled</b> <b>Genetic</b> Algorithms for Inductive Learning). Time-series forecasting is a special type of classification on which this stud...|$|R
