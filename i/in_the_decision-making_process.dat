5|$|In 1879, again head of Internal Affairs, Kogălniceanu began {{organizing}} {{the administration of}} Northern Dobruja, through decrees. He supported a distinct legal regime, as a transition from Ottoman administration, and a period of rebuilding—in effect, a colonial rule, aiming for the assimilation of locals into the Romanian mainstream, but respectful of Dobrujan Islam. Unlike other partisans of colonization (including scientist Ion Ionescu de la Brad), Kogălniceanu saw the new territory as open only to ethnic Romanian homesteaders. His intercession {{played a part in}} the ethnic policies: he is reported to have personally urged the Romanian pastoralists (mocani) to abandon their traditional lifestyle and their Budjak homes, offering them the option of purchasing Northern Dobrujan land. This had become widely available after the partition of Ottoman estates, the nationalization of land once owned by the Muhajir Balkan, and the appropriation of uncultivated plots (miriè). Kogălniceanu also advised the local administration to overrepresent existing Romanian communities <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>process.</b>|$|E

40|$|The primary aim of {{this thesis}} is to explore public {{participation}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> environmental <b>decision-making</b> <b>process</b> for potential benefits in developing Korean environmental laws. Public participation contributes to sustainable development through effective environmental management; in addition, it improves accountability and transparency <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>processes</b> of governmental agencies as a complementary measure of direct and participatory democracy. Therefore, public participation is crucial not only to environmental protection {{but also to the}} development of democracy—two major concerns of Korea <b>in</b> <b>the</b> new Millennium...|$|R

25|$|In the Anglo-Saxon System of {{labour market}} regulation, the government's {{legislative}} role {{is much more}} limited, which allows for more issues to be decided between employers and employees and any union or employers' associations which might represent these parties <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>process.</b> However, in these countries, collective agreements are not widespread; only a few businesses and a few {{sectors of the economy}} have a strong tradition of finding collective solutions in labour relations. Ireland and the UK belong to this category, and in contrast to the EU core countries above, these countries first joined the EU in 1973.|$|E
25|$|The {{process for}} {{choosing}} which images the museum acquires is simple {{but can be}} contentious.

Some of the criteria used <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>process</b> are: The number of existing portraits of the individual already in the collection, {{the quality of the}} potential portrait, the uniqueness of the potential portrait, the reputation of the portrait's author, and the cost of the portrait.

25|$|Consequently, it is {{suggested}} that the management of the CFP could be improved through the application of the theory of subsidiarity—the principle that political decisions should be handled at the lowest, least-centralised competent level. The subsidiarity principle was introduced into EU policies as part of the 1992 Maastricht Treaty; however, it does not apply to areas such as the CFP over which the Community retains exclusive competence. A partial devolution of authority, for example involving Member States <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>process</b> and delegating the day-to-day management of fisheries to industry-based organisations, could potentially facilitate the inclusion of industry concerns into the CFP, involving those directly affected by the policy in management decisions and creating to a CFP which encourages compliance and collaboration.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} of the EU {{in terms of}} international or constitutional law has been much debated. It began life as an international organisation and gradually developed into a confederation of states. However, since the mid-1960s it has also added several of the key attributes of a federation, such as the direct effect {{of the law of}} the general level of government upon the individual and majority voting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>process</b> of the general level of government, without becoming a federation per se. Scholars thus today see it as an intermediate form lying between a confederation and a federation, being an instance of neither political structure. For this reason, the organisation is termed sui generis (incomparable, one of a kind), although some argue that this designation is no longer valid.|$|E
25|$|The Minister for Home Affairs {{pointed out}} that the Minister would not in {{practice}} make the decision in isolation {{from the rest of the}} Cabinet. Even so, amendments were made to the process of the decision to issue a restraining order. While the Minister would have power to make the order in first instance by issuing a notice to the individual, this order would have to be confirmed by the President within 30 days of the receipt of the report of the PCRH. The President would act on Cabinet's advice except where it was contrary to the PCRH's recommendation. These changes formalized the involvement of the Cabinet <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>process</b> and involved the President as an additional safeguard, thereby addressing the concern about the subjectivity of allowing the Minister to be the sole decision-maker. However, it was decided that the decision to issue a restraining order would remain non-justiciable and would not be subject to judicial review.|$|E

25|$|Although the DMK and the AIADMK {{started playing}} a minimal role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>process</b> in the Central {{government}} in the late 1960s, their actual participation in coalition governments came only in 1979, when two AIADMK Members of Parliament, Satyavani Muthu and Aravinda Bala Pajanor, joined the short-lived Charan Singh Ministry, which followed the Morarji Desai-led Janata Party government (1977–79). The DMK's Murasoli Maran joined the V.P. Singh Ministry in 1989. The DMK shared power with the subsequent United Front governments led by H.D. Deve Gowda and I.K. Gujral. In the Atal Bihari Vajpayee Ministry (1998–99), three parties from Tamil Nadu, the AIADMK, the Marumalarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (MDMK) and the Pattali Makkal Katchi (PMK) were represented. In the BJP-led National Democratic Alliance (NDA) Ministry, headed by Vajpayee (1999–2004), the DMK, the MDMK and the PMK all had representatives. In fact, {{it was in this}} Ministry that Tamil Nadu had the largest representation. At one stage there were 10 Ministers from Tamil Nadu, seven of them from the Dravidian parties. In the Vajpayee Ministry (1998–99), the AIADMK's presence lasted only a few months. The Manmohan Singh-led central government included cabinet members from DMK.|$|E
25|$|Water {{investment}} planning for rural areas is {{done at the}} district level by the respective water departments. In 2009 the NGO WaterAid studied the local government planning process for water investments {{in four of the}} country's 99 rural districts, namely in Mpwapwa, Kongwa, Iramba and Nzega. Planning begins with long wish-lists based on demands from the village level. Since real priorities are difficult to identify, one selection criterion used is the balance of money held in the village water fund. This is seen as a sign of community ownership and can be easily explained to councillors and villagers. Other purported criteria are health statistics and data collected from a waterpoint mapping exercise, but they are not given high priority in practice. Selection is done {{in such a way that}} water projects are equally divided between the constituencies of the district’s Members of Parliament. Furthermore, councilors steer projects to villages in their wards, with more dynamic councillors exerting greater influence. Another de facto criterion is the previous track record in caring for infrastructure: In some areas handpumps have been stolen, making it hard to justify new investments. Communities close to town, located on main roads or with existing social services have an advantage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>decision-making</b> <b>process,</b> since officials visit them more often and the cost of providing infrastructure is lower. The WaterAid report suggests that if there was better availability of data on rural water supply infrastructure this could help the representatives of underserved communities to lobby on behalf of their constituents.|$|E
