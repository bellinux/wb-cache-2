5|$|SS-Untersturmführer (second lieutenant) Amon Göth {{arrives in}} Kraków to oversee {{construction}} of Płaszów concentration camp. When {{the camp is}} completed, he orders the ghetto liquidated. Many people are shot and killed {{in the process of}} emptying the ghetto. Schindler witnesses the massacre and <b>is</b> <b>profoundly</b> affected. He particularly notices a tiny girl in a red coat – one of the few splashes of color in the black-and-white film – as she hides from the Nazis, and later sees her body (identifiable by the red coat) among those on a wagon load of corpses. Schindler is careful to maintain his friendship with Göth and, through bribery and lavish gifts, continues to enjoy SS support. Göth brutally mistreats his Jewish maid Helen Hirsch and randomly shoots people from the balcony of his villa, and the prisoners are in constant fear for their lives. As time passes, Schindler's focus shifts from making money to trying to save as many lives as possible. To better protect his workers, Schindler bribes Göth into allowing him to build a sub-camp.|$|E

25|$|The {{internal}} circadian clock <b>is</b> <b>profoundly</b> {{influenced by}} changes in light, since these are its main clues about what time it is. Exposure to even small amounts of light during the night can suppress melatonin secretion, increase body temperature, and increase cognitive ability. Short pulses of light, {{at the right moment}} in the circadian cycle, can significantly 'reset' the internal clock. Blue light, in particular, exerts the strongest effect, leading to concerns that electronic media use before bed may interfere with sleep.|$|E

25|$|The {{atypical}} clinical syndrome of {{the memory}} disorder (as opposed to organic amnesia) is that a person with psychogenic amnesia <b>is</b> <b>profoundly</b> unable to remember personal information about themselves; {{there is a lack}} of conscious self-knowledge which affects even simple self-knowledge, such as who they are. Psychogenic amnesia is distinguished from organic amnesia in that it is supposed to result from a nonorganic cause; no structural brain damage or brain lesion should be evident but some form of psychological stress should precipitate the amnesia, however psychogenic amnesia as a memory disorder is controversial.|$|E
25|$|The {{difference}} between Europeans and New Englanders {{manifests itself in}} particular in the expression of feelings and emotions, which are very sensitive for the former: love {{is more important than}} money. Moreover, American people are more straitlaced and they have closer links with tradition. The most important thing in life for those living in the 'New World' is, ironically, respecting old traditions and accepting the rules of a good morality. Mr Wentworth <b>is</b> <b>profoundly</b> surprised and fascinated by Eugenia's marriage experience as well as Robert Acton's; in the Americans' eyes, Eugenia is a perplexing woman.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{influential}} {{role that the}} US stock market plays in international finance, a New York University study in late 2014 interprets that in the short run, shocks that affect the willingness to bear risk independently of macroeconomic fundamentals explain most {{of the variation in}} the US stock market. In the long run, the US stock market <b>is</b> <b>profoundly</b> affected by shocks that reallocate the rewards of a given level of production between workers and shareholders. Productivity shocks however play a small role in historical stock market fluctuations at all horizons in the US stock market.|$|E

500|$|In early April 2016, {{the parties}} filed {{submissions}} in court ahead of sentencing. The maximum sentence for the offense {{was five years}} in prison and a $250,000 fine, although the Federal Sentencing Guidelines range was from probation to six months. Hastert asked for probation. Hastert released a statement through his counsel saying: [...] "Mr. Hastert acknowledges that as a young man, he committed transgressions for which he <b>is</b> <b>profoundly</b> sorry. He earnestly apologizes to his former students, family, friends, previous constituents and all others affected by the harm his actions have caused." [...] Hastert did not provide details.|$|E
500|$|When the {{hostilities}} were over, on 16 May 1945, Éamon de Valera, in {{his speech}} to the nation said: [...] "To the men of our Mercantile Marine who faced all the perils of the ocean to bring us essential supplies, the nation <b>is</b> <b>profoundly</b> grateful." [...] The Ringsend area of Dublin has a long maritime tradition.

500|$|Arthur {{has also}} {{been used as a}} model for modern-day behaviour. In the 1930s, the Order of the Fellowship of the Knights of the Round Table was formed in Britain to promote Christian ideals and Arthurian notions of medieval chivalry. In the United States, {{hundreds}} of thousands of boys and girls joined Arthurian youth groups, such as the Knights of King Arthur, in which Arthur and his legends were promoted as wholesome exemplars. However, Arthur's diffusion within contemporary culture goes beyond such obviously Arthurian endeavours, with Arthurian names being regularly attached to objects, buildings, and places. As Norris J. Lacy has observed, [...] "The popular notion of Arthur appears to be limited, not surprisingly, to a few motifs and names, but {{there can be no doubt}} of the extent to which a legend born many centuries ago <b>is</b> <b>profoundly</b> embedded in modern culture at every level." ...|$|E
500|$|Fredric Jameson's {{analysis}} {{highlights the}} polysemy of the shark and the multiple {{ways in which}} it can be and has been read—from representing alien menaces such as communism or the Third World to more intimate dreads concerning the unreality of contemporary American life and the vain efforts to sanitize and suppress the knowledge of death. He asserts that its symbolic function {{is to be found in}} this very [...] "polysemousness which <b>is</b> <b>profoundly</b> ideological, insofar as it allows essentially social and historical anxieties to be folded back into apparently 'natural' ones... to be recontained in what looks like a conflict with other forms of biological existence." [...] He views Quint's demise as the symbolic overthrow of an old, populist, New Deal America and Brody and Hooper's partnership as an [...] "allegory of an alliance between the forces of law-and-order and the new technocracy of the multinational corporations... in which the viewer rejoices without understanding that he or she is excluded from it." ...|$|E
500|$|With {{the rise}} of feminist {{literary}} criticism in the 1970s, Mary Shelley's works, particularly Frankenstein, began to attract much more attention from scholars. Feminist and psychoanalytic critics were {{largely responsible for the}} recovery from neglect of Shelley as a writer. Ellen Moers {{was one of the first}} to claim that Shelley's loss of a baby was a crucial influence on the writing of Frankenstein. She argues that the novel is a [...] "birth myth" [...] in which Shelley comes to terms with her guilt for causing her mother's death as well as for failing as a parent. Shelley scholar Anne K. Mellor suggests that, from a feminist viewpoint, it is a story [...] "about what happens when a man tries to have a baby without a woman... <b>is</b> <b>profoundly</b> concerned with natural as opposed to unnatural modes of production and reproduction". Victor Frankenstein's failure as a [...] "parent" [...] in the novel has been read as an expression of the anxieties which accompany pregnancy, giving birth, and particularly maternity.|$|E

500|$|As Thomas Asbridge wrote, [...] "Just {{as we can}} {{do nothing}} more than {{estimate}} the number of thousands {{who responded to the}} crusading ideal, so too, with the surviving evidence, we can gain only a limited insight into their motivation and intent." [...] Previous generations of scholars argued that the crusaders were motivated by greed, hoping to find a better life away from the famines and warfare occurring in France, but as Asbridge notes, [...] "This image <b>is</b> ... <b>profoundly</b> misleading." [...] He argues that greed was unlikely to have been a major factor because of the extremely high cost of travelling so far from home, and because almost all of the crusaders eventually returned home after completing their pilgrimage rather than trying to carve out possessions for themselves in the Holy Land. It is difficult or impossible to assess the motives of the thousands of poor for whom there is no historical record, or even those of important knights, whose stories were usually retold by monks or clerics. As the secular medieval world was so deeply ingrained with the spiritual world of the church, it is quite likely that personal piety was a major factor for many crusaders.|$|E
500|$|Other {{commentators}} have cautioned against {{the conclusion that}} The Oceanides is either an example of impressionism or somehow stylistically indebted to Debussy. Tawaststjerna, for example, believes that the piece's [...] "anchorage in the major-minor harmony and the relatively sparing use of modal and whole-tone formulae" [...] indicates that the tone poem [...] "belongs {{to the world of}} late romanticism", the impressionistic character of its texture, harmonic vocabulary, and rhythmic patterns notwithstanding. Hurwitz has likewise criticized the [...] "roaring cataract of nonsense in the Sibelius literature" [...] about the influence of the French impressionists on the composer. [...] "Similar musical problems often produce similar solutions", Hurwitz notes. [...] "In this case, any symphonic portrait of the ocean is bound to rely more on texture and color than on vocal melody, {{for the simple reason that}} the ocean is not a person and does not sing... nor does it lend itself to... anthropomorphic approach...". Layton detects the presence of [...] "normal Sibelian procedures and techniques" [...] in The Oceanides, dismissing any serious debt to Debussy. [...] "Its growth from the opening bars onward <b>is</b> <b>profoundly</b> organic", Layton writes. [...] "And its apparent independence from the rest of Sibelius's work is manifest only at a superficial level".|$|E
500|$|Dale's {{death was}} adulated by commentators, who affirmed {{that it was}} a gruesome and {{emotional}} scene. Scott Meslow of The Atlantic suggested that because of his death, The Walking Dead embraced a more dark and sinister philosophy. He asserted, [...] "Taken broadly, his death marks the death of a certain morality on the show, and the embrace of a philosophy that's something crueler and darker. Dale, unlike any of the other survivors, maintained his humanity to the very end of his waking life—but even he couldn't choose not to come back as something amoral and inhuman. In a world that seems utterly incapable of getting better, it's a none-too-reassuring sign that things will almost certainly get worse." [...] Gina McIntyre of Los Angeles Times echoed synonymous thoughts: [...] "It's left to Daryl to shoot the man to end his suffering, which <b>is</b> <b>profoundly</b> too bad. Without Dale to raise all those nagging concerns about doing what's right, zombie apocalypse or no zombie apocalypse, I fear for the future of this walker-infested world." [...] Handlen and Calgary Herald Kimberly Potts thought {{that it was a}}mong the shocking moments in the series, while Friedman expressed that she was [...] "riveted by the awesome attack [...] and filled with sadness, as the original gang watched their friend die a slow and painful death". Handlen remarked: [...] "It’s a shocking scene, partially for its straight-forward gore, and partially for the astonished, uncomprehending expression on Dale’s face. [...] This, right here, is the kind of sequence the show needs. There’s too little sense of danger right now." [...] Verne Gay of Newsday described the sequence as [...] "violent", and ultimately summated that DeMunn's absence will be felt as the show progresses. However, Lamar professed that the writers should have written off Dale in a more respectable way; [...] "That wasn't the way to off the show's most annoyingly sane character. Dale's redeeming quality was his ability to guilt everybody into paying lip service to rule of law; his weakness was his naïveté. Having an escaping Randall kill him would've offered some poetic symmetry. I'm not going to miss this character, but he deserved a better send-off." [...] Time journalist Nate Rawlings drew allusions from Dale's attack to the episode title, commenting that [...] "when the lone zombie we see in this episode tears open Dale’s stomach, spilling the contents of his body onto the cold ground, we’re reminded that the walkers are the judges, they’re the jury, and this particular one was a most brutal executioner." [...] Although he was shocked by the sequence, Goldman assailed the earlier development of Dale in the episode, opining that he was obnoxious.|$|E
