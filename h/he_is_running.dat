Finding {{that the rest of}} the orchestra have stopped playing while he continued his one recurring note, Bean, with encouragement from Rattle, plays an extended flourish and lastly touches a note that makes a flatulent sound, then stops.|$|E

One morning, he wakes up from a dream of a beautiful girl dressed in white on the beach. He leaves for work, and his buried alter egos, dressed in white shirts, black slacks, assorted ties and each holding either red or white roses, emerge mysteriously. At work, his boss gives him a stack of paperwork, which he does mechanically. Meanwhile, at home, the alter egos are {{in a circle around}} his coffee table, throw the roses in the center, and leave. Back at work, he prepares to go home, but is then given another stack of documents. His frustrations boil over, and he throws his tie at his boss. He runs home not knowing what <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>running</b> for, and at the moment that he walks in the door, the last of the alter egos exits.

500|$|In {{order to}} {{illustrate}} the special abilities of the Justice League members, special effects company Entity FX had {{to come in and}} digitally create the powers for each character. Senior Producer at Entity FX, Trent Smith, explained that they wanted to give Bart's super speed a [...] "more current" [...] look, so they employed 3D techniques in conjunction with the 2D graphics from season four to create a [...] "hybrid" [...] image for the screen. Smith explained that the 3D technology allowed the team to [...] " [...] a path for [...] that he {{may not be able to}} achieve in the 2D composite world".

But he knows just as well as I do that if I wasn't bump-drafting, he never would have had a shot to pass Junior." [...] Additionally, he denied that he drove more aggressively because he was leaving. Third-place {{finisher}} Kurt Busch argued Vickers was in a [...] "Catch-22" [...] situation: [...] "He was trying to help his teammate. It just didn't turn out that way. Vickers was doing the best he could to help the 48. He just didn't anticipate the 8 car blocking as long as he did." [...] Vickers would later receive additional security during the next race weekend.|$|E
500|$|During {{the scene}} {{when a car}} is about to fall off a cliff, Robin the Boy Wonder appears and {{attempts}} to save the people. However, upon arrival, he is criticized as {{he will not be}} able to save them: this is a reference to the portrayal of Robin from the 1960s Batman series. Throughout the episode, other references are made to fictitious super heroes. In total, three references were made to Star Trek, all of which involve Star Trek actor George Takei's character, Mr. Sulu. When Peter has a flashback about passing his college test <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>running</b> around with the song [...] "I'm Free" [...] by Kenny Loggins playing in the background. This is a reference to the movie Footloose. When Peter is recounting what Hartman did to him, he goes into a flashback in court, and everything turns black and white and grainy: this is a reference to The Accused, starring Jodie Foster.

500|$|The {{first three}} volumes {{are set in}} the 1920s and follow the main {{characters}} through school, university and their first steps towards social and professional acceptance. The next three are placed in the 1930s; the protagonists become established, put down roots, watch the international situation anxiously and prepare for war. [...] The background for the seventh, eighth and ninth volumes is the Second World War, which not all the characters survive. The final three books cover the 25 years {{from the early days}} of the post-war Attlee government to the counterculture and protests of the early 1970s. During the long narrative, the focus changes frequently from one group to another; new faces appear while established characters are written out, sometimes reappearing after many volumes, sometimes not at all, though news of their doings may reach Jenkins, through one or other of his many acquaintances. Apart from Jenkins, Widmerpool is the only one of the 300-odd characters who takes part in the action of each of the 12 volumes. Richard Jones, writing in the Virginia Quarterly Review, suggests that the novels may be regarded as [...] "the dance of Kenneth Widmerpool, who is Jenkins's fall-guy, tormentor, and antithesis". Widmerpool dogs Jenkins's career and life; in the opening pages of the first book at school, he [...] is encountered running through the mists, in the vain hope of athletic glory. In the final stages of the last book <b>he</b> <b>is</b> <b>running</b> again, this time at the behest of the quasi-religious cult that has claimed him.|$|E
