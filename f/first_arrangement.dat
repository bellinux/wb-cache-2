In these tests, {{it was discovered that}} the resonance frequencies and the likelihood of cavitation could be reduced by up to 75%. Those who conducted these tests also tried two different arrangements of the nozzles to find out which one was more effective. The <b>first</b> <b>arrangement</b> used only one nozzle, which though it used considerably less power than the other option, it was not nearly as successful. The multi-nozzle system, on the other hand, gave much better results but required more power to operate.|$|E

He praised {{the high quality}} of the arrangements and performances, but found the piano arrangements more interesting for their originality than the rock arrangements; unlike for the From Astral rock arrangements, many of the Duality arrangements were of rock or rock-inspired tracks, which he felt left the arrangements feeling superfluous. He concluded, however, that the piano arrangements and Oblivion cover made the album an [...] "easy recommendation".|$|E

2500|$|Weston met Johnny Mercer {{while working}} for Paramount in 1942; Mercer, who was {{preparing}} to start Capitol Records, wanted Weston to write for his new company. Paul wrote, arranged and directed Mercer's [...] "Strip Polka"-the <b>first</b> <b>arrangement</b> written for the new label on April 6, 1942. On August first of that year, the 1942–44 musicians' strike began. No union musicians could record for any record company, but were able to play for live engagements and radio shows; the issue which prompted the strike was regarding record companies paying royalties to musicians. Many record companies had [...] "stockpiled" [...] recordings of their stars prior to the strike, planning to release them {{over a period of}} time. [...] While the older, more established record labels were able to do this, the newly formed Capitol had no opportunity to do likewise. [...] The strike brought the new company to a standstill until Johnny Mercer began his radio show, Johnny Mercer's Music Shop, in June 1943. The radio show {{was meant to be a}} venue for Capitol's talent during the Musicians' Strike. Mercer and Capitol recording artist Jo Stafford hosted the program, with Weston and his orchestra providing the music for it. Stafford and Weston had first met in 1938, when he was working as an arranger for Tommy Dorsey; Weston was responsible for getting Stafford's group, the Pied Pipers, an audition with Dorsey for his radio show. The recording ban was lifted for Capitol in October 1943 after an agreement was reached between the Musicians' Union and the record company; Weston was then able to return to the recording studio. In 1944, he became the company's music director. When appointed, Weston was the youngest musical director for any major record company.|$|E

60|$|On {{the next}} morning she took her departure. The nearest station on the railway by which she {{was to go to}} Littlebath was distant about twelve miles, and it was {{proposed}} that she should be sent thither in Mrs. Wilkinson's phaëton. This, indeed, except the farm-yard cart, was the only vehicle which belonged to the parsonage, and was a low four-wheeled carriage, not very well contrived for the accommodation of two moderate-sized people in front, and of two immoderately-small people on the hind seat. Mrs. Wilkinson habitually drove it herself, with one of her daughters beside her, and with two others--those two whose legs had been found by measurement to be the shortest--in durance vile behind; but when so packed, it was clear to all men that the capacity of the phaëton was exhausted. Now the <b>first</b> <b>arrangement</b> proposed was, that Arthur should drive the phaëton, and that Sophy should accompany Adela to the station. But Sophy, in so arranging, had forgotten that her friend had a bag, a trunk, and a bonnet-box, the presence of which at Littlebath would be indispensable; and, therefore, at the last moment, when the phaëton came to the door with the luggage fastened on the hinder seat, it was discovered {{for the first time that}} Sophy must be left behind.|$|E
6000|$|... § 15. On {{applying}} a like analysis {{to the larger}} divisions of a sentence, we find {{not only that the}} same principle holds good, but that the advantage of respecting it becomes marked. In the arrangement of predicate and subject, for example, we are at once shown that as the predicate determines the aspect under which the subject is to be conceived, it should be placed first; and the striking effect produced by so placing it becomes comprehensible. Take the often-quoted contrast between [...] "Great is Diana of the Ephesians," [...] and [...] "Diana of the Ephesians is great." [...] When the <b>first</b> <b>arrangement</b> is used, the utterance of the word [...] "great" [...] arouses those vague associations of an impressive nature with which it has been habitually connected; the imagination is prepared to clothe with high attributes whatever follows; and when the words, [...] "Diana of the Ephesians," [...] are heard, all the appropriate imagery which can, on the instant, be summoned, is used {{in the formation of the}} picture: the mind being thus led directly, and without error, to the intended impression. When, on the contrary, the reverse order is followed, the idea, [...] "Diana of the Ephesians" [...] is conceived with no special reference to greatness; and when the words [...] "is great" [...] are added, the conception has to be remodeled: whence arises a loss of mental energy and a corresponding diminution of effect. The following verse from Coleridge's 'Ancient Mariner,' though somewhat irregular in structure, well illustrates the same truth: ...|$|E

40|$|In a neoclassical growth {{model with}} many regions and a mobile factor, two federal {{arrangements}} are considered. In the <b>first</b> federal <b>arrangement</b> {{the central government}} chooses a uniform tax policy, whereas in the second each regional government chooses its own tax policy. The main {{result is that the}} <b>first</b> federal <b>arrangement</b> leads to high tax rates and economic stagnation, whereas the second leads to low tax rates and economic growth. This result stems from a time consistency problem. The lack of tax competition forces a time consistency problem on the central government under the <b>first</b> federal <b>arrangement.</b> In contrast, regional tax competition acts as a commitment device under the second federal arrangement. The fundamental feature in the environment that gives rise to different abilities of the state to commit is the different structure of authority within the state.
