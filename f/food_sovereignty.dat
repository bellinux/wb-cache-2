25|$|The {{approach}} {{known as}} <b>food</b> <b>sovereignty</b> views the business practices of multinational corporations {{as a form}} of neocolonialism. It contends that multinational corporations have the financial resources available to buy up the agricultural resources of impoverished nations, particularly in the tropics. They also have the political clout to convert these resources to the exclusive production of cash crops for sale to industrialized nations outside of the tropics, and in the process to squeeze the poor off of the more productive lands. Under this view subsistence farmers are left to cultivate only lands that are so marginal in terms of productivity as to be of no interest to the multinational corporations. Likewise, <b>food</b> <b>sovereignty</b> holds it to be true that communities should be able to define their own means of production and that food is a basic human right. With several multinational corporations now pushing agricultural technologies on developing countries, technologies that include improved seeds, chemical fertilizers, and pesticides, crop production has become an increasingly analyzed and debated issue. Many communities calling for <b>food</b> <b>sovereignty</b> are protesting the imposition of Western technologies on to their indigenous systems and agency.|$|E

A decision-focused approach, using a consequence matrix, is proposed to link people's expressed values to food policy responses and clarify trade-offs across options. This reframing should encourage new dialogue, new policy alternatives, and increased acceptance of actions supporting AFS.

40|$|Drawing on the authors' {{personal}} {{experience in the}} Edible Public Space project (Leeds, UK), this paper explores the “spheres of influence” and contradictions that shaped the project's trajectory. We identify and analyse the dynamics and contradictions at play {{in the formation of}} an urban gardening group grown out of a coming together of scholarly and committed action ambitions and aim to capture learning elements for scholarly activism, political gardening and radical urbanism. We explore the action research intervention with a focus on the role of spatial interventions in fostering social innovation in the public food and land agenda. We structure our discussion in a threefold conceptual framework: (i) a discussion on shifting planning arenas and their understanding in social innovation; (ii) an overview of the role of political gardening practices, in particular of <b>food</b> commons/food <b>sovereignty</b> initiatives, in envisioning and implementing alternative urbanism and (iii) a discussion on the action research nexus, through a thick case study description in which we also unpack our own engagement and positionality. Doing so, we aim to contribute to the creation of an active memory of political gardening. The paper will speak in particular to a rising number of researcher–gardeners–environmentalists, and aims to problematise the links between research-informed strategic thinking and actions, and the vocation of critical urban theory to provide and make visible alternatives for social change...|$|R

To analyze the links between nutrition and agriculture, this paper presents the conceptual framework related to food and nutrition security, and stresses the correlations among concepts, institutional structures and program design in Brazil. Dominant models of food production and consumption are scrutinized in the light of these relationships. This paper also highlights differences amongst different ways to promote nutrition-sensitive agriculture through food-acquisition programs from family farmers, experiences in agro-ecology and bio-fortification programs. In the closing remarks, the paper draws some lessons learned from the Brazilian experience that highlight the advantages of family farming and rapid food production, distribution and consumption cycles in order to promote access to an affordable, diversified and more adequate diet in nutritional terms...|$|R

40|$|Aim: Food {{security}} {{is one of}} the most pressing issues of our century because of its implications for the future. To that extent, this article is a preliminary attempt to shed light on the opportunities stemming from the commercialization of quinoa. Description: We undertook this study to try and grasp why the Cosmovision of Andean populations consider quinoa as an alternative for development. We first go through some aspects of <b>food</b> security, <b>sovereignty</b> and justice, which will eventually lead us to take a closer look at quinoa’s proper characteristics and production process. We will complement our study by an analysis of data on the commercialization of quinoa in order to evaluate its opportunities internationally. Conclusions: Quinoa presents very interesting nutritive characteristics, offers a variety of seeds, is relatively easy to grow virtually anywhere and can be used in a number of byproducts. To that extent, it should be seriously considered as palatable solution to the global food crisis. Food {{security is}} one of the most pressing issues of our century because of its implications for the future. To that extent, the aim of this article is to shed light on the opportunities stemming from the farming of quinoa in the international context. The methodology boils down to an exploratory investigation based on secondary sources of information. We conclude that quinoa offers a variety of configurations for cultivation and likewise allows the production of a wide range of finished products. Nonetheless, it is critical to encourage its farming and consumption in order to bring palatable solutions to the world food security crisis...|$|R
40|$|In {{the light}} of climate-change-induced {{volatility}} of production volumes and declining growth dynamics of agricultural productivity, the international agro-food trade {{is likely to increase}} in importance in the future, especially in developing countries with a high rate of population growth. The rules governing international trade (WTO disciplines and the WTO+ rules enshrined in bilateral, regional and mega trade liberalization agreements) have a critical influence on – and impinge upon – national sovereignty over agricultural policies Even so, the existing flexibility mechanisms in the WTO Agreement on Agriculture and those currently being negotiated in the WTO Doha Round could enable interested and determined governments to pursue policies that create the conditions for, or strengthen, food security and sustainable rural development, and to promote the truly sustainable transformation of agriculture, including agroecological production. The main precondition in this regard is that the clear political will exists to move in this direction, and that this is translated into a realistic strategy that incorporates appropriate flanking and supportive trade measures. It is therefore pertinent to conduct a detailed review of the existing WTO rules, and of those trade and agriculture policy measures introduced after the 2008 food price crisis which aim to use agro ecological/eco-functional intensification (i. e. more quality than volume) to foster <b>food</b> security, <b>sovereignty</b> and sustainable rural development, as well as the concomitant enhanced resilience. Such an analysis would also scrutinize the problematic general incentives in the trade rules which foster excessive specialization, factory-like mass production and the enormous cost-related pressures...|$|R
40|$|Latin America {{is home to}} {{dramatically}} diverse agroecological regions which harbor {{a high concentration of}} underutilized plant species, whose genetic resources hold the potential to address challenges such as sustainable agricultural development, <b>food</b> security and <b>sovereignty,</b> and climate change. This paper examines the status of an expert-informed list of underutilized crops in Latin America and analyses how the most common features of underuse apply to these. The analysis pays special attention to if and how existing international policy and legal frameworks on biodiversity and plant genetic resources effectively support or not the conservation and sustainable use of underutilized crops. Results show that not all minor crops are affected by the same degree of neglect, and that the aspects under which any crop is underutilized vary greatly, calling for specific analyses and interventions. We also show that current international policy and legal instruments have so far provided limited stimulus and funding for the conservation and sustainable use of the genetic resources of these crops. Finally, the paper proposes an analytical framework for identifying and evaluating a crop’s underutilization, in order to define the most appropriate type and levels of intervention (international, national, local) for improving its status...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The Suleiman mountainous {{region is}} an {{important}} cradle of animal domestication and the habitat of many indigenous livestock breeds. The dromedary camel is a highly appreciated and valued animal and represents an important genetic resource. Camel herders, living in remote areas, have developed their own ways to treat diseases in camels, based on a long time of experience. Methods Information about the diseases and the ethnoveterinary practices performed was collected from a total of 90 herders and healers by interviews and participant observations. Results The respondents classified the diseased in major and minor fractions. Clinical signs were given in detail. Mange followed by trypanosomosis and orf were considered the most prevalent diseases, and also caused the greatest economic losses. Orf was regarded the most complex disease. The season was considered to have great influence on the occurrence of the diseases. A variety of different treatments were described, such as medicinal plants, cauterization, odorant/fly repellents, pesticides, larvicides, cold drink, yogurt and supportive therapy (hot food, hot drink). Conclusions There is paramount need to document and validate the indigenous knowledge about animal agriculture in general and ethnoveterinary practices in particular. This knowledge is rapidly disappearing and represents a cultural heritage {{as well as a}} valuable resource for attaining <b>food</b> security and <b>sovereignty.</b> </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{release for}} the {{planting}} of Genetically Modified Organisms (GMOs) is a controversial issue and requires care {{because it involves}} the country’s <b>food</b> security, the <b>sovereignty</b> of producers about seed use and the long-term potential environmental risks. Thus, {{it is important to}} analyze how the decision-making structures, both formal and informal, are established to address these issues, i. e. environmental governance of GMOs in Brazil, which is the purpose of this article. Among the good governance practices to be analyzed, we will be using the following parameters: popular participation in decision-making, and access to information and environmental justice. The following results were obtained: from the standpoint of public participation, there are flaws, as decision-makers have little social permeability, therefore CTNBio holds public hearings only by its own decision or by court order, which limits access to participation in the deliberation on GMOs. Regarding access to information, we also pointed out problems, as the Biosafety Information System has not been implemented. Environmental justice is inefficient since many cases of contamination of organic and conventional varieties by GMOs economically harm farmers, especially the first ones, who are at risk of losing their organic certification. Moreover, the decision on conducting environmental impact studies is determined by CTNBio, injuring principles that give this task to the organs of SISNAMA. We conclude therefore that the regulation of GMOs in Brazil does not have good environmental governance...|$|R
