5|$|Many mutagens {{fit into}} the space between two {{adjacent}} base pairs, this is called intercalation. Most intercalators are aromatic and planar molecules; examples include <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide,</b> acridines, daunomycin, and doxorubicin. For an intercalator to fit between base pairs, the bases must separate, distorting the DNA strands by unwinding of the double helix. This inhibits both transcription and DNA replication, causing toxicity and mutations. As a result, DNA intercalators may be carcinogens, {{and in the case}} of thalidomide, a teratogen. Others such as benzopyrene diol epoxide and aflatoxin form DNA adducts that induce errors in replication. Nevertheless, due to their ability to inhibit DNA transcription and replication, other similar toxins are also used in chemotherapy to inhibit rapidly growing cancer cells.|$|E

25|$|DNA detection: the {{compound}} <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide,</b> in aqueous solution, {{has very little}} fluorescence, as it is quenched by water. Ethidium bromide's fluorescence is greatly enhanced after it binds to DNA, so this compound is very useful in visualising the location of DNA fragments in agarose gel electrophoresis. Intercalated ethidium is in a hydrophobic environment when it is between the base pairs of the DNA, protected from quenching by water which is excluded from the local environment of the intercalated ethidium. <b>Ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> may be carcinogenic – an arguably safer alternative is the dye SYBR Green.|$|E
25|$|Toxic {{effect of}} <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> on trypanosomas {{is caused by}} shift of their kinetoplastid DNA to Z-form. The shift is caused by {{intercalation}} of EtBr and subsequent loosening of DNA structure that leads to unwinding of DNA, shift to Z-form and inhibition of DNA replication.|$|E
25|$|Molecules {{other than}} {{proteins}} can be separated by 2D electrophoresis. In supercoiling assays, coiled DNA is separated {{in the first}} dimension and denatured by a DNA intercalator (such as <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> or the less carcinogenic chloroquine) in the second. This {{is comparable to the}} combination of native PAGE /SDS-PAGE in protein separation.|$|E
25|$|As {{with most}} {{fluorescent}} compounds, <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> is aromatic. Its core heterocyclic moiety is generically {{known as a}} phenanthridine, an isomer {{of which is the}} fluorescent dye acridine. Absorption maxima of EtBr in aqueous solution are at 210nm and 285nm, which correspond to ultraviolet light. As a result of this excitation, EtBr emits orange light with wavelength 605nm.|$|E
25|$|<b>Ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> {{has also}} been used {{extensively}} to reduce mitochondrial DNA copy number in proliferating cells. Effect of EtBr on mitochondrial DNA is used in veterinary medicine to treat trypanosomosis in cattle, as EtBr binds molecules of kinetoplastid DNA and changes their conformation to Z-DNA form. This form inhibits replication of kinetoplastid DNA which is for trypanosomas lethal.|$|E
25|$|In biology {{methylene}} blue {{is used as}} a dye for a number of different staining procedures, such as Wright's stain and Jenner's stain. Since it is a temporary staining technique, {{methylene blue}} {{can also be used to}} examine RNA or DNA under the microscope or in a gel: as an example, a solution of methylene blue can be used to stain RNA on hybridization membranes in northern blotting to verify the amount of nucleic acid present. While methylene blue is not as sensitive as <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide,</b> it is less toxic and it does not intercalate in nucleic acid chains, thus avoiding interference with nucleic acid retention on hybridization membranes or with the hybridization process itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{sentinel}} cells {{varies depending on}} the farming status of wild D. discoideum. When exposed to a toxic environment created {{by the use of}} <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide,</b> it was shown that the number of sentinel cells per millimeter was lower for farmers than non-farmers. This was concluded by observing the trails left behind as the slugs migrated and counting the number of sentinel cells present in a millimeter. However, the number of sentinel cells does not affect the spore production and viability in farmers. Farmers exposed to a toxic environment produce the same number of spores as farmers in a non-toxic environment, and the spore viability was the same between the farmers and non-farmers. When Clade 2 Burkholderia, or farmer-associated bacteria, are removed from the farmers, spore production and viability were {{similar to that of the}} non-farmers. Thus, it is suggested that bacteria carried by the farmers provide an additional role of protection for the farmers against potential harm due to toxins or pathogens.|$|E
2500|$|The {{disposal}} of laboratory <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> remains a controversial subject. [...] <b>Ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> can be degraded chemically, or collected and incinerated. [...] It {{is common for}} <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> waste below a mandated concentration to be disposed of normally (e.g., pouring it down a drain). [...] A common practice is to treat <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> with sodium hypochlorite (bleach) before disposal. [...] According to Lunn and Sansone, chemical degradation using bleach yields compounds which are mutagenic by the Ames test. [...] Data are lacking on the mutagenic effects of degradation products. [...] Lunn and Sansone describe more effective methods for degradation. Elsewhere, <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> removal from solutions with activated charcoal or amberlite ion exchange resin is recommended. [...] Various commercial products are available for this use.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> {{is thought}} {{to act as a}} mutagen because it intercalates double {{stranded}} DNA (i.e., inserts itself between the strands), deforming the DNA. This could affect DNA biological processes, like DNA replication and transcription. [...] <b>Ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> {{has been shown to be}} mutagenic to bacteria via the Ames test, but only after treatment with liver homogenate, which simulates the metabolic breakdown of the molecule being tested. The lack of detected mutagenicity without liver homogenate indicates that <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> is not directly mutagenic, but that its metabolites are. [...] The identity of these mutagenic metabolites are unknown. [...] The National Toxicology Program states it is nonmutagenic in rats and mice. These conclusions are supported by a subchronic carcinogenicity study in mice, whereby no mutagenic effects were detected. <b>Ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> (Homidium brand) use in animals to treat trypanosome infection suggests that toxicity and mutagenicity are not high. [...] Studies have been conducted in animals to evaluate EtBr as a potential antitumorigenic chemotherapeutic agent. Its chemotherapeutic use is due to its toxicity to mitochondria. A more recent study shows that EtBr acts as a topoisomerase I poison, just like several anticancer drugs used in humans. [...] The above studies do not support the commonly held idea that <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> is a potent mutagen in humans, but they do indicate that it can be toxic at high concentrations.|$|E

2500|$|<b>Ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> is an {{intercalating agent}} {{commonly}} {{used as a}} fluorescent tag (nucleic acid stain) in molecular biology laboratories for techniques such as agarose gel electrophoresis. It is commonly abbreviated as [...] "EtBr", which is also an abbreviation for bromoethane. [...] When exposed to ultraviolet light, it will fluoresce with an orange colour, intensifying almost 20-fold after binding to DNA. Under the name homidium, it has been commonly used since the 1950s in veterinary medicine to treat trypanosomiasis in cattle, a disease caused by trypanosomes. [...] The high incidence of antimicrobial resistance makes this treatment impractical in some areas, where the related isometamidium chloride is used instead. [...] <b>Ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> may be a mutagen, although this depends on the organism exposed and the circumstances of exposure.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> is {{commonly}} used to detect nucleic acids in molecular biology laboratories. In the case of DNA this is usually double-stranded DNA from PCRs, restriction digests, etc. Single-stranded RNA can also be detected, since it usually folds back onto itself and thus provides local base pairing for the dye to intercalate. Detection typically involves a gel containing nucleic acids placed on or under a UV lamp. Since ultraviolet light is harmful to eyes and skin, gels stained with <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> are usually viewed indirectly using an enclosed camera, with the fluorescent images recorded as photographs. Where direct viewing is needed, the viewer's eyes and exposed skin should be protected. [...] In the laboratory the intercalating properties have long been used to minimize chromosomal condensation when a culture is exposed to mitotic arresting agents during harvest. The resulting slide preparations permit {{a higher degree of}} resolution, and thus more confidence in determining structural integrity of chromosomes upon microscopic analysis.|$|E
2500|$|After the {{electrophoresis}} is complete, {{the molecules}} in the gel can be stained {{to make them}} visible. DNA may be visualized using <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> which, when intercalated into DNA, fluoresce under ultraviolet light, while protein may be visualised using silver stain or Coomassie Brilliant Blue dye. Other methods may {{also be used to}} visualize the separation of the mixture's components on the gel. If the molecules to be separated contain radioactivity, for example in a DNA sequencing gel, an autoradiogram can be recorded of the gel. [...] Photographs can be taken of gels, often using a Gel Doc system.|$|E
2500|$|Several {{laboratory}} {{chemicals are}} controversial {{from the perspective}} of Green chemistry. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology created a [...] "Green" [...] Alternatives Wizard [...] to help identify alternatives. <b>Ethidium</b> <b>bromide,</b> xylene, mercury, and formaldehyde have been identified as [...] "worst offenders" [...] which have alternatives. Solvents in particular make a large contribution to the environmental impact of chemical manufacturing and there is a growing focus on introducing Greener solvents into the earliest stage [...] of development of these processes: laboratory-scale reaction and purification methods. In the Pharmaceutical Industry, both GSK and Pfizer have published Solvent Selection Guides for their Drug Discovery chemists.|$|E
2500|$|In forensics, the {{analysis}} is performed by extracting nuclear DNA from the cells of a sample of interest, then amplifying specific polymorphic regions of the extracted DNA {{by means of the}} polymerase chain reaction. Once these sequences have been amplified, they are resolved either through gel electrophoresis or capillary electrophoresis, which will allow the analyst to determine how many repeats of the microsatellites sequence in question there are. [...] If the DNA was resolved by gel electrophoresis, the DNA can be visualized either by silver staining (low sensitivity, safe, inexpensive), or an intercalating dye such as <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> (fairly sensitive, moderate health risks, inexpensive), or as most modern forensics labs use, fluorescent dyes (highly sensitive, safe, expensive). Instruments built to resolve microsatellite fragments by capillary electrophoresis also use fluorescent dyes. Forensic profiles are stored in major databanks. The British data base for microsatellite loci identification was originally based on the British SGM+ system using 10 loci and a sex marker. The Americans increased this number to 13 loci. The Australian database is called the NCIDD, and since 2013 it has been using 18 core markers for DNA profiling.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{alternatives}} to <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> which are advertised as being less dangerous and having better performance. For example, several SYBR-based dyes {{are used by}} some researchers {{and there are other}} emerging stains such as Novel Juice. [...] SYBR dyes are less mutagenic than EtBr by the Ames test with liver extract. However, SYBR Green I was actually found to be more mutagenic than EtBr to the bacterial cells exposed to UV (which is used to visualize either dye). This may be the case for other [...] "safer" [...] dyes, but whilst mutagenic and toxicity details are available [...] these have not been published in peer reviewed journals. [...] MSDS for SYBR Safe reports a LD50 for rats of >5g/kg, which is higher than that of EtBr (1.5g/kg), but both are many orders of magnitude higher than the concentrations used in molecular biology. [...] Also, many alternative dyes are suspended in DMSO, which has health implications of its own including increased skin absorption of organic compounds. Despite the performance advantage of using SYBR dyes instead of EtBr for staining purposes, many researchers still prefer EtBr since it is considerably less expensive.|$|E
2500|$|All five of {{the bases}} found in DNA and RNA are {{aromatic}} [...] adenine and guanine (purine core structures), and cytosine, thyamine, and uracil (pyrimidine core structures). [...] Biologically active substances including caffeine and uric acid (responsible for gout) also possess purine structures. [...] DNA and RNA have [...] polymeric structures with repeating nucleotide units, each possessing a phosphate group, a ribose or deoxyribose sugar, and a nucleobase. [...] Nucleobases are Watson-Crick base paired through hydrogen bonding, and these pairs are stacked {{through the center of}} the double helix through π-π interactions of their aromatic systems. [...] The possibility for extended planar aromatic systems such as acridine (dibenzopyridine) to insert between base pairs was recognised by Lerman in a process now known as intercalation. [...] Intercalating agents have applications in biochemical research as stains (<b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide)</b> and in medicine as chemotherapeutic agents (doxorubicin). [...] Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons like benzopyrenes and dibenzanthracene are some of the 43 known carcinogens in tobacco smoke (the Environment Protection Agency classes tobacco smoke as a class A carcinogen). Benzopyrene has been shown to form preferentially in lung cancer hotspots and is known to be transformed into a metabolite, (+)-Benzopyrene-7,8-dihydrodiol-9,10-epoxide, which forms mutagenic adduct with DNA. [...] The epoxide and group on the metabolite alkylate the N2 of guanine bases while the pyrene system intercalates between base pairs, disrupting the structure. [...] Intercalation interferes with DNA replication which can inhibit tumour growth but can also cause changes in the base pair sequence which explains its potential for carcinogeneity.|$|E

5000|$|SYBR Safe is a safer {{alternative}} to the known mutagen <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide.</b> Although {{it is still a}} carcinogen, as it binds DNA just like <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide.</b> However the dilution of SYBR safe in the solvent DMSO allows for its passage into living cells which <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide</b> is unable to do thus making SYBR Safe in fact more dangerous to use than <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide.</b> However, as the molecule itself is quite a bit larger than <b>ethidium</b> <b>bromide,</b> it does not bind to the column of a gel extraction as easily, making it less efficient when trying to clone a DNA fragment into a plasmid.Interestingly, SYBR Safe has a very similar structure to thiazole orange, which has a methyl group attached to the charged nitrogen, whereas SYBR Safe has an N-propyl group.
