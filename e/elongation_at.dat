5|$|The {{mechanical}} pressure {{exerted by}} the appressorium is generated from physiological processes that increase intracellular turgor by producing osmolytes such as glycerol. Adaptations {{such as these}} are complemented by hydrolytic enzymes secreted into the environment to digest large organic molecules—such as polysaccharides, proteins, and lipids—into smaller molecules that may then be absorbed as nutrients. The vast majority of filamentous fungi grow in a polar fashion (extending in one direction) by <b>elongation</b> <b>at</b> the tip (apex) of the hypha. Other forms of fungal growth include intercalary extension (longitudinal expansion of hyphal compartments that are below the apex) {{as in the case}} of some endophytic fungi, or growth by volume expansion during the development of mushroom stipes and other large organs. Growth of fungi as multicellular structures consisting of somatic and reproductive cells—a feature independently evolved in animals and plants—has several functions, including the development of fruit bodies for dissemination of sexual spores (see above) and biofilms for substrate colonization and intercellular communication.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{conventional}} {{materials used}} in superplastic forming operations generally have grain sizes of ~ 2 µm or larger and they exhibit superplasticity at relatively low strain rates. Processing by equal-channel angular pressing (ECAP) produces materials having ultrafine-grain sizes, usually in the submicrometer range. If these ultrafine grains show reasonable stability at elevated temperatures, the alloys may exhibit a capability for achieving superplastic <b>elongations</b> <b>at</b> high strain rates. This paper examines the development of ultrafine-grained structures and superplastic ductilities in a spray-cast aluminum 7034 alloys through ECAP.

For IT- and RT-series specimens with bar fracture, the relative <b>elongations</b> <b>at</b> ultimate loads ranged from 5.2 to 8.3  % with an average of 7.0  %. However, for IT- and RT-series specimens with bar pull-out, corresponding values varied from 3.7 to 11.0  % with an average of 6.3  %. These results were consistent with the understanding that the deformation capacities of bars were better than those of the sleeve regions (JGJ 355 - 2015 2015). Based on these findings, it was suggested to pursue the failure mode of bar fracture instead of bar pull-out in the product design process to make full use of the deformation capacities of the bars.|$|R
