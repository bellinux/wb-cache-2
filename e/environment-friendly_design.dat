40|$|The present work {{deals with}} a multi-objective {{optimisation}} approach to incorporate up-to-date financial models in the multidisciplinary conceptual design of a commercial aircraft. Design optimisations based on financial objective functions are compared to standard performance-based optimal solutions. The main novelty is in {{the extension of the}} financial models to the long-term investments of a wider group of stakeholders. The rationale underlying this research stems from two considerations: (i) the environmentally sustainable development of the air transportation system in the next 20 years is subordinate to breakthrough technologies, since the consolidated ones have reached their saturation point; (ii) the economic impacts of highly innovative concepts on the stakeholders chain is still uncertain. The problem is addressed at the conceptual design level and the analysis is performed within a comprehensive multidisciplinary framework, adopting all the technical constraints required in aeronautical design. The Pareto fronts obtained using performance and financial merit factors, reveal that the proposed financial model yields highly efficient, technically sound concepts. The design space point corresponding to the negative cash flows minimum turned out to be very close to the one corresponding to minimum acoustic emissions, confirming that the financial model drives the optimiser towards <b>environment-friendly</b> <b>designs...</b>|$|R

Wojtkiewicz. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF) xi, 166 pages, appendix AThe quest to <b>design</b> <b>environment-friendly</b> and sustainable engineering systems has witnessed {{more and more}} fervent efforts in recent years. With the growth of affordable large-capacity computing resources, predictive, science-based computational models have become instrumental in this pursuit. The present work develops efficient computational methods for the uncertainty analysis of large dynamical and mechanical systems with local nonlinearities and uncertainties. Two approaches have been utilized: (i) reduction {{of the size of}} the system, and (ii) use of parallel computing resources. The first approach utilizes the response of a nominal system to efficiently compute the response of related systems; three types of analysis methods have been developed. The first method can be utilized for efficient modal analysis of undamped linear systems with local stiffness uncertainties. The second method can perform efficient frequency domain analysis of linear systems with local damping and stiffness uncertainties. The third method can be utilized for efficient time domain analysis of systems with local nonlinearities and uncertainties. These methods provide gains in computational efficiency approaching three orders of magnitude for moderately-sized computational models compared to the corresponding conventional methods. The gains in computational efficiency are expected to be more pronounced as the dimensionality of the system is increased. The second approach to increase computational efficiency utilizes modern parallel computing devices, specifically, graphics processing units (GPUs) to perform uncertainty analysis of computational models. A variety of uncertainty quantification methods have been implemented on a GPU. The gains in computational efficiency compared to corresponding CPU-based implementations range from one to three orders of magnitude. These GPU implementations are expected to serve as initial bases for further developments in the use of GPUs in this field...|$|R

40|$|If we {{have gone}} through the first {{generation}} of housing design that pursued functional optimization, ergonomics, and circulation efficiency during the last century, now we are living in the second generation where more advanced goals, such as universal design, ubiquitous design, sustainable design, and <b>environment-friendly</b> <b>design,</b> are emphasized. Al-though this second generation of design focuses upon the wellness of humans in accordance with environment, it still has the attitude that a more precisely designed home can guarantee a better life. What lacks in this approach is the free-dom of the body; it needs to make its own choice as to how to use a space. Thus, it is suggested in this paper that what is important in designing a home is to provide alternatives in daily lives so as to make a full exploration of a given space. These alternatives can be made by offering residents an interpretable space where they can figure out space usages and routs in a constantly changing context. Two spatial devices are discussed in depths as a way to realize this interpretable house: room-to-room enfilade and ring spatial structure. By investigating some existing house plans, it is illustrated how they can guarantee the freedom of the body, and thus alternatives for the flexible domestic life...|$|E
40|$|<b>Designing</b> <b>environment-friendly</b> products, {{known as}} eco-products, {{has become an}} {{essential}} practice in many manufacturers mainly due to increasing consumer awareness to the environment, governmental regulations and marketing strategies. Most of the scientific literature on eco-product design deals mainly with {{the improvement of the}} environmental performance. Engineers and eco-product designers need large quantities of information for evaluating environmental performance of eco-products. However, other considerations relate to the creation of eco-products should not be overlooked, such as product form aesthetics and functionality. This research moves beyond technical evaluations of environmental performance of eco-products by developing a new design decision support approach for evaluating the eco-product value (EPV) as perceived by consumers. To do so, this research develops a new approach using Kansei engineering, neural network (NN), and multiattribute decision making (MADM) methods in order for product designers to achieve optimal eco-product form design based on combinations of EPV attributes. An experimental study on office chairs is conducted to illustrate how the EPV evaluation model can be developed and used to evaluate the value of a given eco-product. The Kansei engineering method is used to translate consumers’ feeling of the office chair into product form elements, and help product designers understand consumers’ perception. Product samples are collected from 100 collected office chairs by using multidimensional scale and cluster analysis, by which 27 representative office chairs are chosen for the consumer-oriented experiments. Morphological analysis is used to extract 7 design elements as well as 20 types of form components. In addition, the value of eco-products is measured by three dimensions, characterised by aesthetic, functional, and environmental attributes, which are derived from both the literature and expert product designers. The aesthetic, functional and environmental dimensions consist of 7, 3 and 5 perceivable EPV attributes respectively. Each EPV attribute is assessed through a consumer-oriented experimental process. Results of Quantitative Theory Type I analysis have indicated the relative importance of office chair form elements to EPV attribute images. To enhance the applicability of this approach, NN models are applied for providing a mechanism to support the eco-product design decision making process by establishing a database of design alternatives. Then, MADM models are used to obtain the value of a given eco-product with weighted design attributes in an EPV evaluation model, which integrates both the consumer’s and designer’s viewpoints as a whole. The best design decision for a given design setting has a maximum weighted value among all design alternatives. In addition, the correlation between EPV attributes and eco-product form image is analysed by using Pearson correlation analysis to the product form image word pairs and EPV attributes. The result shows a weak non-linear relationship between EPV attributes and product form images. As such, eco-product designers can consider these two variables separately when designing eco-products. The value evaluation approach developed in this research is novel in that the target eco-product design parameter is the consumer perceived EPV which is measured in aesthetic, functional, and environmental dimensions. This is different from existing techniques for eco-product design and evaluation. The approach is verified through an application to office chair design for emphasising environmental perception. Specifically, office chair design sketches are developed based on the result of MADM analysis. The outcomes of this research have a great potential for solving practical EPV selection and ranking problems by applying the EPV attribute weights given by the product designers. Various experimental results can be used as insightful guidelines for selecting an eco-product from product form design element combination for a given EPV attribute...|$|R
