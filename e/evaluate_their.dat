5|$|A {{statement}} is considered falsifiable {{if there is}} an observation or a test that could be made that would demonstrate that the {{statement is}} false. Statements that are not falsifiable cannot be examined by scientific investigation since they permit no tests that <b>evaluate</b> <b>their</b> accuracy. Creationists such as Henry M. Morris have claimed that any observation can be fitted into the evolutionary framework, so it is impossible to demonstrate that evolution is wrong and therefore evolution is non-scientific.|$|E

She embarked the V6 and V10 prototypes for a period in 1942 and in January–February 1943. They used the small platform abaft the funnel to take-off and land. The Kriegsmarine (German navy) wished to <b>evaluate</b> <b>their</b> potential for anti-submarine warfare and mine reconnaissance, but visual detection proved to be possible only in clear weather.|$|E
5|$|Intense {{tropical}} cyclones pose {{a particular}} observation challenge, {{as they are}} a dangerous oceanic phenomenon, and weather stations, being relatively sparse, are rarely available {{on the site of}} the storm itself. In general, surface observations are available only if the storm is passing over an island or a coastal area, or if there is a nearby ship. Real-time measurements are usually taken in the periphery of the cyclone, where conditions are less catastrophic and its true strength cannot be evaluated. For this reason, there are teams of meteorologists that move into the path of tropical cyclones to help <b>evaluate</b> <b>their</b> strength at the point of landfall.|$|E

5|$|Drugs {{function}} by binding {{to specific}} locations on target molecules and causing some desired change, such as disabling a target or causing a conformational change. Ideally, a drug should act very specifically, and bind only to its target without interfering with other biological functions. However, {{it is difficult}} to precisely determine where and how tightly two molecules will bind. Due to limits in computing power, current in silico methods usually must trade speed for accuracy; e.g., use rapid protein docking methods instead of computationally costly free energy calculations. Folding@home's computing performance allows researchers to use both methods, and <b>evaluate</b> <b>their</b> efficiency and reliability. Computer-assisted drug design has the potential to expedite and lower the costs of drug discovery. In 2010, Folding@home used MSMs and free energy calculations to predict the native state of the villin protein to within 1.8 angstrom (Å) root mean square deviation (RMSD) from the crystalline structure experimentally determined through X-ray crystallography. This accuracy has implications to future protein structure prediction methods, including for intrinsically unstructured proteins. Scientists have used Folding@home to research drug resistance by studying vancomycin, an antibiotic drug of last resort, and beta-lactamase, a protein that can break down antibiotics like penicillin.|$|E
