5|$|Various {{violations}} of law, including illicitly opening ballot boxes, illegal possession of ballots, and adding names to the electoral register, {{took place in}} twelve Quebec ridings. The RCMP felt it had <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> prosecute in five ridings, {{and a total of}} twelve people were convicted. The offences did not affect the outcome of any races.|$|E
5|$|A {{small ship}} travels to a {{rotating}} space station. Aboard the station, {{a group of}} starfish-like beings discuss how to warn humans of an impending disaster, deciding on contacting Japanese scientist Dr. Kumara. Meanwhile, flying saucers are spotted over the skies of Tokyo, baffling scientists. A journalist tries to get a statement from Dr. Kumara about the sightings, but Kumara replies {{that there is not}} <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> formulate a hypothesis. At an observatory, Professor Isobe spots an object in his telescope apparently releasing smaller objects.|$|E
5|$|After {{extensive}} testimony, Justice Spicer {{ruled on}} November 30 {{that there was}} not <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> indict the men. He said the evidence indicated that the Earps and Holliday acted within the law and that Holliday and Wyatt had been deputized temporarily by Virgil. Though the Earps and Holliday were free, their reputations had been tarnished. The Cowboys in Tombstone looked upon the Earps as robbers and murderers and plotted revenge.|$|E

5|$|As a child William {{was educated}} in Jerusalem, at the cathedral {{school in the}} Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The scholaster, or school-master, John the Pisan, taught William to read and write, and first {{introduced}} him to Latin. From the Historia {{it is clear that}} he also knew French and possibly Italian, but there is not <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> determine whether he learned Greek, Persian, and Arabic, as is sometimes claimed.|$|E
5|$|Discectomy (the partial {{removal of}} a disc that is causing leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy has better {{outcomes}} at one year but not at four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown {{to result in a}} different outcome than regular discectomy. For most other conditions, there is not <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.|$|E
5|$|Forensic {{evidence}} on the package eventually leads to Bardale, and then to The Judge. The Judge is arrested for questioning, and knowing {{that there is not}} <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> warrant sentencing him, he offers Black a job with him. Black refuses, but The Judge is released. Bardale is incensed that The Judge has manipulated the law to his own ends, and passes sentence on him for hypocrisy. Finding Bardale alone in a farmhouse, Black discovers that the convict had fed The Judge to his pigs.|$|E
25|$|Most {{alternative}} therapies {{do not have}} <b>enough</b> supporting <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> recommend them. Moreover, when only the best conducted studies {{are taken into account}} results tend to be similar to placebo.|$|R
50|$|Male {{and female}} {{homosexuality}} is illegal in Brunei. The country {{passed a law}} that came into force on 22 April 2014, allowing the death penalty to be administered by stoning for homosexual acts, such as sexual intercourse, given there is <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> pointing <b>to</b> the action (i.e. with four trusted, impartial, and truthful witnesses in attendance). It has been acknowledged as a crime in Brunei {{with the introduction of}} the Sharia law. The law also stipulates that adultery is to be punished with death by stoning given there is <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> pointing <b>to</b> the action (i.e. with four trusted, impartial, and truthful witnesses in attendance). Without four qualified witnesses, there will be no stoning.|$|R

5|$|Freamon and Leander Sydnor gather <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> arrest Stanfield {{and most}} of his top lieutenants, seizing a large {{quantity}} of drugs. Stanfield suspects that Michael is an informant, and orders him killed. Michael realizes he is being set up and kills Snoop instead. A wanted man, he leaves Bug with an aunt and begins a career as a stick-up man. With his support system gone, Dukie lives with drug addicts.|$|E
5|$|He {{was taken}} to Frankfort and tried before an {{examining}} court, but Commonwealth's Attorney Charles S. Bibb {{said that he had}} not yet collected <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> detain him. Beauchamp was released, but agreed to stay in Frankfort for ten days to allow the court to finish its investigation. During this time, Beauchamp wrote letters to John J. Crittenden and George M. Bibb requesting their legal aid in the matter. Neither letter was answered. Meanwhile, Beauchamp's uncle, a state senator, gathered a defense team that included former U.S. Senator John Pope.|$|E
5|$|Sampson felt, in 1995, {{that there}} was not <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> {{conclude}} that Achelousaurus was a direct descendant of Einiosaurus. Unlike Horner, he decided to perform a cladistic analysis to establish a phylogeny. This showed an evolutionary tree wherein Achelousaurus split off between Einiosaurus and Pachyrhinosaurus, as Horner had predicted. Contrary to Horner's claim, Styracosaurus albertensis could not have been a direct ancestor, as it was a sister species of Centrosaurus in Sampson's analysis.|$|E
50|$|Because every 50 {{years is}} a Jubilee year, there is a Yobel Cycle; Because every seven {{years is a}} sabbatical year, there is a seven-year Release Cycle. The {{placement}} of these cycles is controversial. Historically there are <b>enough</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> fix the sabbatical years in the Second Temple Period. But it may not match with the sabbatical cycle derived from the biblical period; {{and there is no}} consensus on whether or not the Jubilee year is the fiftieth year or {{the latter half of the}} forty ninth year.|$|R
50|$|Gredelj {{was arrested}} by the Ustashe {{in the summer of}} 1941. He was {{tortured}} in prison, but said nothing. He was set free, since there was not <b>enough</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> prove his guilt. After that, he was appointed to work in illegal press cell of the Communist Party of Croatia in Klaićeva street. Ustasha agents discovered illegal press room on 23 December 1941, and tried to arrest Gredelj. He started shooting and tried to escape, but was mortally wounded. He was transported to Vinogradska street hospital where he soon died of wounds.|$|R
50|$|In some areas, such as Australia, {{authorities}} {{believe that}} there is not <b>enough</b> scientific <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> support the use of abdominal thrusts and their use is not recommended in first aid. Instead, chest thrusts are recommended.|$|R
5|$|Zappa {{was often}} sick as a child, {{suffering}} from asthma, earaches and sinus problems. A doctor treated his sinusitis by inserting a pellet of radium {{into each of}} Zappa's nostrils. At the time, little was known about the potential dangers of even small amounts of therapeutic radiation, and although it has since been claimed that nasal radium treatment has causal connections to cancer, no studies have provided significant <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> confirm this.|$|E
5|$|Four {{days after}} the shootout, Ike Clanton filed murder charges against Doc Holliday and the Earps. Wyatt and Holliday were arrested and brought before Justice of the Peace, Wells Spicer. Morgan and Virgil were still {{recovering}} at home. Only Wyatt and Holliday were required to post $10,000 bail, which was paid by their attorney Thomas Fitch, local mine owner E.B. Gage, Wells Fargo undercover agent Fred Dodge, and other business owners appreciative of the Earps' efforts to maintain order. Virgil Earp was suspended as town marshal pending {{the outcome of the}} trial. Justice Spicer convened a preliminary hearing on October 31 to determine if there was <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> go to trial.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Skinner {{visits the}} Lone Gunmen, who are {{monitoring}} UFO {{activity in the}} United States {{in the hopes of}} tracking down Mulder. Skinner later finds out that someone has used Mulder's FBI pass {{to gain access to the}} X-Files, and that the Bureau task force considers him the main suspect. Meanwhile, Doggett has gathered <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> track Mulder's whereabouts before his so-called abduction, discovering that Mulder was dying and had his name engraved in his family's gravestone to mark his death in 2000. Later on, more evidence of high UFO activity in Clifton, Arizona is found by The Lone Gunmen. Concurrently, Doggett receives information about Gibson Praise (Jeff Gulka) when someone slips his file under his door.|$|E

5|$|Modern {{research}} {{has estimated that}} the quake was between 6.0 and 6.3 on the Richter scale, and the United States Geological Survey lists it as the largest earthquake {{in the history of}} Massachusetts. Scientists are unclear on the causes of this and other quakes in the northeastern United States. There are a number of old faults in the region, but none of them are known still to be active. It is possible that the Cape Ann earthquake may have been remotely triggered by a larger earthquake in Lisbon, Portugal, a few weeks prior, although there is not <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> prove that they are linked.|$|E
5|$|No {{medication}} is approved {{to halt the}} progression of the initial injury to secondary injury. The variety of pathological events presents opportunities to find treatments that interfere with the damage processes. Neuroprotection methods to decrease secondary injury, {{have been the subject}} of interest follows TBI. However, trials to test agents that could halt these cellular mechanisms have met largely with failure. For example, interest existed in cooling the injured brain; however, a 2014 Cochrane review did not find <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> see if it was useful or not. A 2016 review found that maintaining a normal or low normal temperature appeared useful in adults but not children. High quality evidence to support targeted temperature management below normal however is poor.|$|E
5|$|On {{checking}} {{records of}} telephone calls {{made to the}} dealer, the police found that some had been made from a mobile phone registered in Ireland, and on further checking the records of that phone {{it appeared that the}} calls were made from locations consistent with the known whereabouts of the Ford truck. One call was to a known IRA member. The phone was last used at 9:23am {{on the morning of the}} bombing, just three minutes after the bombers had parked their truck in Corporation Street. On 27 June, the phone's registered owner reported that it had been stolen 17days earlier, but the police felt they had gathered <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> bring a prosecution against the six IRA men held in London.|$|E

Vijayakanth has <b>enough</b> <b>evidences</b> <b>to</b> arrest the dangerous criminal Tiger Kali (Charan Raj). Vijayakanth befriends Rekha (Gouthami), a C.I.D inspector, without knowing that she is Seetha's friend. Seetha compels Rekha to live with them. Seetha has the blood cancer but she hides to her husband. When her husband and her friend know this news, they decide to go in U.S.A for the treatment but Tiger manages to kill Seetha and erases the proofs. Vijayakanth is now more determined to catch Tiger.|$|R

50|$|His {{theories}} are, however, disregarded {{by historical}} journals and most historians, e.g. Mircea Babeş, Lucian Boia and Alexandra Tomiţă, who label these theories as pseudoscience and protochronistic and consider {{that there is}} not <b>enough</b> scientific <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> support them.|$|R
5|$|The {{trial of}} Clay Shaw {{takes place in}} 1969. Garrison {{presents}} the court with further evidence of multiple killers and dismissing the single bullet theory, and proposes a Dealey Plaza shots scenario involving three assassins who fired six total shots and framing Oswald for the murders of Kennedy and officer J. D. Tippit but the jury acquits Shaw after less than one hour of deliberation. The film reflects that members of that jury stated publicly that they believed there was a conspiracy behind the assassination, but not <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> link Shaw to that conspiracy. Shaw {{died of lung cancer}} in 1974, but in 1979 Richard Helms testified that Clay Shaw had been a part-time contact of the Domestic Contacts Division of the CIA. The end credits claim that records related to the assassination will be released to the public in 2029.|$|E
5|$|When he {{returned}} to Berkeley, Lawrence mobilized his team to go painstakingly over the results to gather <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> convince Chadwick. Meanwhile, at the Cavendish laboratory, Rutherford and Mark Oliphant found that deuterium fuses to form helium-3, which causes {{the effect that the}} cyclotroneers had observed. Not only was Chadwick correct in that they had been observing contamination, but they had overlooked yet another important discovery, that of nuclear fusion. Lawrence's response was to press on with the creation of still larger cyclotrons. The 27-inch cyclotron was superseded by a 37-inch cyclotron in June 1937, which in turn was superseded by a 60-inch cyclotron in May 1939. It was used to bombard iron and produced its first radioactive isotopes in June.|$|E
5|$|Dromaeosaurids {{share many}} {{features}} with early birds (clade Avialae or Aves). The precise {{nature of their}} relationship to birds has undergone {{a great deal of}} study, and hypotheses about that relationship have changed as large amounts of new evidence became available. As late as 2001, Mark Norell and colleagues analyzed a large survey of coelurosaur fossils and produced the tentative result that dromaeosaurids were most closely related to birds, with troodontids as a more distant outgroup. They even suggested that Dromaeosauridae could be paraphyletic relative to Avialae. In 2002, Hwang and colleagues utilized the work of Norell et al., including new characters and better fossil evidence, to determine that birds (avialans) were better thought of as cousins to the dromaeosaurids and troodontids. A consensus of paleontologists has concluded that there is not yet <b>enough</b> <b>evidence</b> <b>to</b> determine whether any dromaeosaurids could fly or glide, or whether they evolved from ancestors that could.|$|E
