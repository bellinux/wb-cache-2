500|$|In 1999, Sony and Capcom greenlit a Resident Evil {{film with}} George A. Romero {{signed on as}} the film's {{director}} and screenplay writer. Romero's association with Capcom, the Resident Evil video game series creators, had extended from 1998 when Romero directed an ad campaign for Biohazard 2 (Resident Evil 2) in Japan. Romero stated in an official appearance in Universal Studios' Talk City chatroom that he had his secretary play the entire game through and record the gameplay so he could study it as a resource. [...] Romero's screenplay {{was based on the}} first Resident Evil game and included characters from the video games. Chris Redfield and Jill Valentine were the lead characters, involved in a romantic relationship. Barry Burton, Rebecca Chambers, Ada Wong, and Albert Wesker were to also appear. [...] The ending to the film would have been {{similar to that of the}} best ending to the first Resident Evil game. Romero's script was disapproved of and production was placed into development hell. Capcom producer Yoshiki Okamoto explained to the editors of Electronic Gaming Monthly that [...] "Romero's script wasn't good, so Romero was fired". [...] In February 2000, Romero revealed in an interview with DGA magazine that [...] "I don't think they were into the spirit of the video game and wanted to make it more of a war movie, something heavier than I thought it should be. So <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> never liked my script." [...] As Romero's script was a close, but not full, adaptation of the game, Capcom believed fans would feel that the film had been altered too much from the game and that newcomers would dislike the premise.|$|E

5000|$|My heroes were Isiah Thomas, Michael Jordan, Magic Johnson. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> were <b>just</b> so {{competitive}} and creative.

Williams of After Ellen noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship."

5000|$|When Special X {{was dropped}} from the line up in 2008, Brutus was tasked with {{creating}} the first ever punk rock radio station Fungus 53. Assistant programmer on the channel was DJ Russ Brown. The channel became respected enough for its support of the genre {{that it was celebrated}} by punk band NOFX in the song [...] "Fungus". The song featured the lyrics, [...] "I hate the radio but I like Fungus. The only punk-rock station, it's humongous. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> play Misfit's Walk among us.

5000|$|... "There {{were a lot}} of {{delicate}} situations going on politically when we were at Sire/Warner Brothers—basically, Deadsy was something so outside {{of what was going on}} in music, that they weren't about to take a chance. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> ultimately <b>they</b> <b>just</b> didn't believe in it and wouldn't release it.

5000|$|On May 16, 2009, ESPN {{baseball}} analyst Peter Gammons {{claimed that}} an unnamed major league player corroborated Merloni's claim. The player, who also {{could not remember}} the doctor's name, placed the briefing as occurring during spring training [...] The player is quoted as having said: [...] "I'm {{not sure of the}} name of the doctor; he was someone outside the Boston organization. In no way did I think Boston was trying to push steroids; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> wanted to educate us on the subject.

5000|$|Stahl {{also said}} [...] "every couple months we'd {{be told that}} they {{accepted}} how we had designed things and it was okay, because {{it was going to}} be a game inspired by the movie. But they were sort of deciding where that line was. At a certain point <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> <b>just</b> wanted us to build stuff, and they thought it would all match up and then when it became an issue they sort of accepted the fact that the game was going to be an 'inspired by,' then I think they tried to put other stuff and other scenarios in that weren't going to be in the film. It just sort of became sort of smushed together, and ended up losing momentum." [...] Stahl said another challenge was creating the illusion that the game's levels were larger than they actually were.|$|E
5000|$|By mid-May, all the first-team players {{apart from}} Sid Wharton and Billy Bennett had signed {{on for the}} coming season,; and those two later did so.

James Tebbs, an outside left, signed from Loughborough, {{and a number of}} young players joined the squad. The Dart took a positive view: [...] "The Heathens mean making a great attempt to gain admission into the 'charmed circle' this season, and if they will only perform a little more consistently away from home <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>they</b> will <b>just</b> about accomplish the feat." ...|$|R
