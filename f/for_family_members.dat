5|$|Later in 2007, Obama {{sponsored}} {{an amendment}} to the Defense Authorization Act to add safeguards for personality-disorder military discharges. This amendment passed the full Senate in the spring of 2008. He sponsored the Iran Sanctions Enabling Act supporting divestment of state pension funds from Iran's oil and gas industry, which has not passed committee; and co-sponsored legislation to reduce risks of nuclear terrorism. Obama also sponsored a Senate amendment to the State Children's Health Insurance Program, providing one year of job protection <b>for</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> caring for soldiers with combat-related injuries.|$|E

5|$|Socially, {{economic}} dynamism {{opened up}} one of the avenues of social mobility in the Roman Empire. Social advancement was thus not dependent solely on birth, patronage, good luck, or even extraordinary ability. Although aristocratic values permeated traditional elite society, a strong tendency towards plutocracy is indicated by the wealth requirements for census rank. Prestige could be obtained through investing one's wealth in ways that advertised it appropriately: grand country estates or townhouses, durable luxury items such as jewels and silverware, public entertainments, funerary monuments <b>for</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> or coworkers, and religious dedications such as altars. Guilds (collegia) and corporations (corpora) provided support for individuals to succeed through networking, sharing sound business practices, and a willingness to work.|$|E

Women's tombstones have rounded tops; men's have pointed tops, and inscriptions for royalty are gilt. <b>For</b> <b>family</b> <b>members,</b> small mausoleums with intricately-decorated stone walls were built.|$|E
5|$|A December 2007 QSR Magazine {{article about}} the {{conflict}} claimed that Burger King Brands had devised a contingency plan to remove itself from the dispute. Citing internal company documents, the Associated Press stated BK had concerns that such agreements might {{prove to be a}} possible violation of anti-trust laws, had possible tax implications, and that there were issues with third-party oversight for the agreements. As part of the company's plan, QSR Magazine claimed that the company was going to cease purchasing product from suppliers with whom the CIW was in disagreement. In response, the company issued a press release in February 2007 claiming that while it is a large purchaser, it is not responsible for the pay rates of it suppliers' workers as wage disputes are the province of the producer. BK also pointed out that it has an open offer of employment for any dissatisfied CIW members and scholarships (through its Have it Your Way Foundation) <b>for</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> of CIW workers.|$|E

5|$|As in Red Dead Redemption, {{the player}} can diverge {{from the main}} story on side quests: {{requests}} from strangers, checklist challenges, and other digressions. These missions are similar in format {{to those of the}} original but their objectives are replaced to fit the zombie horror theme. For example, the player hunts <b>for</b> <b>family</b> <b>members</b> instead of fugitives or empties graveyards instead of gang hideouts. Marston is called to liberate towns overrun by the undead, which unlocks ammo, new places to stay, quests, and the assistance of the living townspeople. After Marston's assistance, the towns remain free of zombies for several in-game days, but will eventually require the player's assistance when zombies return once again. The player decides whether to share ammunition with the townsfolk: ammunition serves as a currency in the game since the shops have closed. The player has fewer correctives for immorality, such as helping or killing other survivors, given the dire circumstances. The game puts a greater emphasis on hyperbolic fun.|$|E

25|$|There {{is greater}} {{indication}} that education in prison helps prevent reincarceration. Many people inside prisons lack education. Dropout rates are seven times greater {{for children in}} impoverished areas than those who come from families of higher incomes.

25|$|Humans {{typically}} have deep attachments to their dogs because dogs are adept at fulfilling emotionally supportive roles in people's lives {{which results in}} high levels of attachment.

25|$|A committal shelter {{was built}} for the {{observance}} of funeral services. The committal shelter, or funeral shelter, is a roofed pavilion, open on three sides, and was intended to make graveside services unnecessary, as elderly mourners may have difficulty walking over uneven ground.
