40|$|Experiments {{carried out}} with several well defined {{antigenic}} systems (hapten conjugates of poly-L-lysine and guinea pig serum albumin) in guinea pigs demonstrated that: 1.

5000|$|The Casoni test is an {{immediate}} hypersensitivity skin test {{used in the}} diagnosis of hydatid disease introduced by casoni.

5000|$|The {{dermatological}} {{symptoms of}} PCT that include blistering and lesions on sun-exposed {{areas of the}} skin are caused by a buildup of porphyrin compounds (specifically uroporphyrinogen) {{close to the surface}} of the skin that have been oxidized by free radicals or sunlight. The oxidized porphyrins initiate degranulation of dermal mast cells, which release proteases that catabolize the surrounding proteins. [...] This begins a cell mediated positive feedback loop which matches the description of a type 4 <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reaction.</b> The resulting blisters therefore do not appear immediately, but begin to show up 2-3 days after sun exposure. Due to the highly conjugated structure of porphyrins involving alternating single and double carbon bonds, these compounds exhibit a deep purple color, resulting in the discoloration observed in the skin. Excess alcohol intake decreases hepcidin production which leads to increased iron absorption from the gut and an increase in oxidative stress. This oxidative stress then leads to inhibition of uroporphyrinogen decarboxylase, creating an excess of uroporphyrinogen III which is oxidized from the relatively harmless porphyrinogens into their reduced porphyrins form. [...] Concentrated instances of oxidative stress (alcohol, physical trauma, psychological stress, etc) cause the liver to hemorrhage these porphyrins into the blood stream where they are then susceptible to oxidation.The strong association of PCT with Hepatitis C infection is not entirely understood. Studies have suggested that the cytopathic effect of the virus on hepatocytes can lead to the release of free iron. This iron can disrupt the activity of cytochrome p450, releasing activated oxygen species. These can oxidize the UROD substrate uroporphyrinogen, which can result in the inhibition of UROD and lead to deficient activity of this key enzyme.|$|E
40|$|In {{previous}} studies we implicated scaling of the stratum corneum as being {{important in the}} clearance of experimental cutaneous Candida infections in guinea pigs. In this model the scaling response appeared to be intensified by <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> to Candida antigens and {{to be responsible for}} the more rapid clearance of infecting organisms by immune animals. The present studies were undertaken to quantitate the degree of epidermal proliferation in such Candida infections and to relate it to <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> as well as other types of inflammation. The two parameters of epidermal proliferation studied were incorporation of tritiated thymidine by basal cells and thickening of the malpighian layer; both were increased markedly in Candida-infected skin of immune animals and also to a lesser extent in Candida-infected skin of nonimmune animals. Positive delayed skin test responses to Candida antigens were associated with increased basal cell thymidine incorporation, but negative delayed responses were not. Inflammation caused by intradermal injection of irritants was also associated with increased basal cell thymidine incorporation. These results indicate that <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> <b>reactions</b> in experimental cutaneous Candida infections act to increase the rate of basal cell turnover, primarily by producing increased inflammation in the lesions. The role of <b>delayed</b> <b>hypersensitivity</b> appears to be nonspecific, since other forms of inflammation are also capable of causing increased epidermal proliferation...|$|R
