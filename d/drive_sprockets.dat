25|$|M3E2/M5 Half-track – International Harvester Half-Track, {{externally}} largely {{identical to}} the M3, but with , IHC RED-450-B engine, different drive train and fuel and electrical system. In fact, only the chassis, bogies, track, idler and <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets,</b> wheels, winches, transfer case, rollers, and machine gun mount were interchangeable. The M5 is heavier than the M3, {{due in part to}} heavier armor. Its body was welded, rather than bolted. The M5 was primarily for Lend-Lease, to Britain, Canada, France, and the Soviet Union.|$|E
25|$|Damage modeling, {{although}} {{limited in}} vehicles, is most noticeable {{in the ability}} to burst tires, although wheeled vehicles can still move even if all the tires are gone, slowly rolling along on the rims. Tracked vehicles such as tanks or APCs can lose their tracks as a result of damage, but may continue moving even though there is no way for the <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> to propel the vehicle. Exposed gas cans on Humvees can be shot in order to detonate their contents, which usually results in the explosion of the vehicle. While burning, destroyed vehicles will cause proximity heat damage to objects and characters. Unavailable vehicles shown in-game include jet aircraft, excavator, forklift and for reasons of scale, destroyers. None of the alien machines can be commandeered by players. Interestingly, the wheeled carts which would presumably be used to move aircraft or heavy vehicles, can also be moved by the player, but movement is very slow and useful for little more than entertainment/novelty.|$|E
500|$|The , water-cooled, , inline 4-cylinder Praga engine used a gasoline-alcohol mix. It had a {{top speed}} on the road of [...] and about [...] cross-country. One [...] fuel tank was located {{on each side of}} the engine. The {{transmission}} had four forward gears and one reverse gear to drive the front-mounted <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets.</b>|$|E

50|$|Shaft-jacking can be minimised by {{devices such}} as {{parallelogram}} swingarms. A practical way to minimise squat on a chain-drive bike is to locate the final <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> {{as close as possible}} to the axis of the swingarm pivot; the ideal solution is to make the final <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> and the swingarm pivot concentric, as was done on the Hesketh V1000.|$|R
50|$|Chain-drive {{systems such}} as the {{derailleur}} systems work best if the chain is aligned with the sprocket plane, especially avoiding the biggest <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> running with the biggest <b>driven</b> <b>sprocket</b> (or the smallest with the smallest). The diagonal chain run produced by these practices is less efficient and shortens the life of all components, with no advantage {{from the middle of}} the range ratio obtained.|$|R
500|$|The [...] Škoda T-11/0 four-cylinder, {{water-cooled}} engine produced [...] at 1,800rpm. Two {{fuel tanks}} were fitted, the main tank with {{a capacity of}} [...] was {{on the left side}} of the engine and the [...] auxiliary tank was on the other side. The engine could run on gasoline, an alcohol-gasoline mixture, and [...] "Dynalkohol" [...] (an alcohol-benzole mixture). It was mounted in the rear along with the six-speed transmission which drove rear-mounted <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets.</b> The suspension was derived from the Vickers 6-Ton tank; eight small pairs of road wheels on four bogies per side, each pair of bogies sprung by a single leaf spring, a front idler wheel, and four track return wheels. An unsprung road wheel was located directly underneath the idler wheel to improve obstacle crossing. The transmission, brakes and steering were mechanically assisted with compressed air, reducing driver fatigue. This last feature proved problematic in the extreme conditions of the Eastern Front.|$|E
50|$|The Grizzly's {{suspension}} used 17-tooth <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> and CDP tracks. In comparison, the M4 used 13 tooth <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets.</b> The CDP {{track was}} lighter and simpler {{than the standard}} US tracks and did not require rubber, which was scarce since the Japanese advance into Southeast Asia and the Fall of Malaya.|$|E

50|$|StuG III Ausf. B: (Sd.Kfz 142; June 1940May 1941, 300 {{produced}} by Alkett) Widened tracks (380 mm). Two Rubber tires on each roadwheel were accordingly widened from 520 × 79 mm to 520 × 95 mm each. Both types of roadwheel were interchangeable. The troublesome 10-speed transmission {{was changed to}} a 6-speed one. The forwardmost return rollers were re-positioned further forward, reducing the vertical movements of the tracks before they were fed to the forward <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> and so reduced the chance of tracks being thrown. In the middle of production of the Ausf. B model, the original <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> with eight round holes was changed to a new cast <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> with six pie slice-shaped slots. This new drive wheel could take either 380 mm tracks or 400 mm wide tracks. 380 mm tracks were not exclusive to new drive wheels. Vehicle number 90111 shows the older drive wheel with wider 380 mm tracks.|$|R

50|$|The WZ-111 {{featured}} a 750 hp supercharged diesel engine and torsion bar suspension system. The idler wheels were in front with <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> in the rear. Many of the suspension components {{were the same}} type used in Soviet heavy tank designs such as the IS-2.|$|E
50|$|The <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> are at {{the front}} with six road wheels, using torsion bar suspension. The BMP-1 has a ground {{pressure}} of (0.6 kg/cm²) {{and is able to}} cross snow-covered and boggy terrain. It has the range, off-road speed and cross-country ability necessary to keep up with fast-moving MBTs.|$|E
50|$|Chain <b>drive</b> uses <b>sprockets</b> and {{a roller}} chain, which {{requires}} both lubrication and adjustment for elongation (stretch) that occurs through wear. The lubricant {{is subject to}} being thrown off the fast-moving chain and results in grime and dirt build up. Chains do deteriorate, and excessive wear {{on the front and}} rear sprockets can be dangerous. In a chain drive the power is transmitted into the real wheel via a cush drive. Conventional roller chain drives suffer the potential for vibration, as the effective radius of action in a chain and sprocket combination constantly changes during revolution ("chordal action"). If a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> rotates at constant RPM, then the chain (and the <b>driven</b> <b>sprocket)</b> must accelerate and decelerate constantly. Most chain-driven motorcycles are fitted with a rubber bushed rear wheel hub to eliminate this vibration issue.|$|R
50|$|BM Oplot is {{equipped}} with torsion bar type suspension. Either side of the six dual rubber-tyred road wheels are provided with idler at forward, <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> at the rear, and track support rollers.|$|R
50|$|Note {{that there}} are some non-powered tracked {{transports}} (i.e. trailers that roll on tracks rather than wheels), which have two idler wheels rather than a <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket.</b> There are also certain pieces of equipment, such as the Caterpillar D9 bulldozer, Tucker Sno-cat and Mattracks rubber track conversion kits, which configure their tracks {{in the shape of a}} triangle, or pyramid (when viewed from the side), with the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> at the tip of the pyramid. In this configuration, there are two idler/roadwheels and one <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> (as well as a number of small, load-bearing roadwheels). In very rare cases, the vehicle lacks an idler wheel at all; in Northern regions, one way people got better traction in deep snow was to take a simple three-axle truck, and install a simple continuous track around the rear wheels, thus forming a basic half-track system which featured two drive wheels, and no idler or road wheels. One almost never sees this on true tracked vehicles, however, as the second drive wheel is redundant.|$|R
50|$|As part of {{the rapid}} {{development}} program, the Loyd used parts from other vehicles: From the Universal Carrier, the track, <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets,</b> and Horstmann suspension units; from the Fordson 7V, the chassis, engine, gearbox, torque tube and front axle. The brake drums and back plates were designed specifically for the Loyd.|$|E
5000|$|Suspension for the [...] "slack track" [...] {{equipped}} Elefant {{consisted of}} six twin bogies (three per side) with longitudinal torsion bars, without any overlapping wheels or return rollers. There are sprockets {{at both ends}} of the vehicle. The <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> are at the rear, while the front pair contain a drum brake system.|$|E
50|$|The 6.08 L, water-cooled, , inline 4-cylinder Praga engine used a gasoline-alcohol mix. It had a {{top speed}} on the road of 30 km/h and about 15 km/h cross-country. One 64.5 L fuel tank was located {{on each side of}} the engine. The {{transmission}} had four forward gears and one reverse gear to drive the front-mounted <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The Caterpillar D10 is a track-type tractor {{manufactured}} by Caterpillar Inc. (then called the Caterpillar Tractor Company). It {{was the first}} modern tractor to use the elevated <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> to improve durability, operator comfort, and ease of maintenance.|$|R

50|$|The Sherman's {{reliability}} {{resulted from}} many features developed for U.S. light tanks during the 1930s, including vertical volute spring suspension, rubber-bushed tracks, and a rear-mounted radial engine with <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> in front. The goals were {{to produce a}} fast, dependable medium tank able to support infantry, provide breakthrough striking capacity, and defeat any tank then in use by the Axis nations.|$|E
50|$|The track {{assembly}} {{is made up}} of four wide rubberised-fabric band tracks reinforced with welded steel cross-pieces; four track guide engagement <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> with nine pairs of polyurethane rollers; road wheels with rubber bands, and four idler wheels (one on either side is provided with a polyurethane rim). The suspension is independent, torsion-bar type, with spring supports on all rollers.|$|E
5000|$|In the SOHC design, the {{camshaft}} operates the valves directly, traditionally via a bucket tappet; or via an intermediary rocker arm. [...] SOHC cylinder heads are generally {{less expensive to}} manufacture than double overhead camshaft (DOHC) cylinder heads. Timing belt replacement can be easier since there are fewer camshaft <b>drive</b> <b>sprockets</b> {{that need to be}} aligned during the replacement procedure.|$|E
50|$|The tractor's most {{distinctive}} feature was its running gear. Four full height roadwheels acted as roadwheels, rear <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket,</b> front idler and track return rollers. This {{was the same}} layout as the Tetrarch light tank, which Vickers-Armstrongs had developed in the 1930s.|$|R
5000|$|The rear {{suspension}} pivot (like the Hesketh V1000) was co-axial with the <b>drive</b> <b>sprocket</b> to maintain constant chain tension. This feature meant that (i) a smaller drive chain {{could be used}} and/or (ii) the chain was less stressed and therefore less likely to break.|$|R
