5|$|<b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Graham Melvin of the Serious Crime Squad {{was placed}} {{in charge of the}} {{investigation}} a few hours after the killing, at 2:00 am on 7 October. The inquiry became the largest {{in the history of the}} Metropolitan Police, with 150 officers assigned full-time. Melvin was born in Halifax in 1941, joining the Metropolitan Police in 1960, then the Criminal Investigation Department. He studied at Bramshill Police College, served with the Flying Squad, and was known for having solved several notorious cases, including that of Kenneth Erskine, the Stockwell Strangler. He became a <b>detective</b> <b>chief</b> <b>superintendent</b> in March, 1985, when he joined the elite International and Organised Crime Squad (SO1).|$|E
5|$|Within a {{month of}} Shaftesbury's disappearance, <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Graham Cox, head of Sussex Police CID, who had been {{contacted}} by Lady Frances Ashley-Cooper, {{said that they were}} treating the matter as a murder case. The French police agreed with Cox, {{due to the lack of}} ransom demands or signs of fraud. Whether dead or alive, there were still no clues as to the whereabouts of the 10th Earl of Shaftesbury.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the trial}} judge had criticized the police investigation, Essex Police held an {{internal}} inquiry, conducted by <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Dickinson. Bamber alleged this report confirmed that evidence had been withheld by the police, so he made a formal complaint, which was investigated in 1991 by the City of London Police. This process uncovered more documentation, which Bamber used to petition the Home Secretary in September 1993 for a referral back to the Court of Appeal, refused in July 1994.|$|E
50|$|In the Garda Síochána, the Republic of Ireland's {{national}} police force, {{the rank of}} <b>chief</b> <b>superintendent</b> is between superintendent and assistant commissioner. <b>Chief</b> <b>superintendents</b> usually command divisions, while <b>detective</b> <b>chief</b> <b>superintendents</b> head the various investigative branches. The rank marking is two red / gold pips over a red / gold bar.|$|R
50|$|The series {{originally}} starred <b>detective</b> <b>chief</b> <b>superintendents</b> Verena Berthold (played by Maja Maranow) and Otto Garber (Florian Martens) as {{the main}} characters. They became a team following the German reunification, which caused the East-German Volkspolizei, where Otto was working, to be incorporated in the (West-German) Kriminalpolizei. They became partners in a special unit in Berlin, led by commissioner Lothar Reddemann (Arnfried Lerche), and also including the <b>detective</b> <b>chief</b> <b>superintendents</b> Yüksel Yüsgüler (Tayfun Bademsoy, whose character died in episode 43 in 2009) and Georg Scholz (Leonard Lansink; until episode 29 in 2005). After Georg's departure, detective Ben Kolberg (Kai Lentrodt: in episode 30 in 2005) joined the team. He was later promoted to <b>chief</b> <b>superintendent,</b> and left the team to make a sailing trip around the world (in episode 70 in 2017).|$|R
50|$|Second Verdict is a six-part BBC {{television}} series from 1976, of dramatised documentaries in which classic criminal cases and unsolved crimes from history were re-appraised by fictional police officers. In Second Verdict, Stratford Johns and Frank Windsor reprised {{for a final}} time their double-act as <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendents</b> Barlow and Watt, hugely popular with TV audiences from the long-running series Z-Cars, Softly, Softly and Barlow at Large. Second Verdict built on the formula of their 1973 series Jack the Ripper in which dramatised documentary was drawn together with a discussion between the two police officers which formed the narrative. Second Verdict also allowed for some location filming and, when the case being re-appraised was within living memory, interviews with real witnesses.|$|R
5|$|Operation Grange {{was led by}} Commander Simon Foy. Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard's Homicide and Serious Crime Command was {{the first}} senior {{investigating}} officer, reporting to <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Hamish Campbell. The team consisted of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables, and around six civilian staff. When Redwood retired in 2014, he was replaced by DCI Nicola Wall. By July 2013 the review had become an investigation.|$|E
5|$|Suffolk police {{linked the}} killings and {{launched}} a murder investigation, codenamed Operation Sumac. Chief Constable Alastair McWhirter acknowledged that Suffolk Constabulary would be reliant on external assistance owing to {{the magnitude of the}} investigation. A senior investigator with the Metropolitan Police, Commander Dave Johnston, was reported to have been drafted into the murder inquiry team from Scotland Yard in London in an advisory capacity. The day-to-day investigation was conducted by <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Stewart Gull.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, Brady {{allegedly}} {{confessed to}} Fred Harrison, a journalist working for The Sunday People, {{that he had}} also {{been responsible for the}} murders of Pauline Reade and Keith Bennett, something that the police already suspected, as both children lived in the same area as Brady and Hindley and had disappeared {{at about the same time}} as their other victims. The subsequent newspaper reports prompted the Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to reopen the case, in an investigation headed by <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Peter Topping, who had been appointed head of GMP's Criminal Investigation Department (CID) the previous year.|$|E
5000|$|Naomi Annie Hocking Messer (1889 - 17 March 1966), {{known as}} Anne Hocking and nicknamed [...] "Mona," [...] was an English crime writer, best remembered for her <b>detective</b> stories {{featuring}} <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> William Austen.|$|R
50|$|Jack the Ripper is a six-part BBC {{television}} drama made in 1973, {{in which}} {{the case of the}} Jack the Ripper murders is reopened and analysed by <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendents</b> Barlow and Watt (Stratford Johns and Frank Windsor, respectively). These characters were hugely popular with UK TV viewers at the time from their appearances on the long-running police series Z-Cars and its sequels Softly, Softly and Barlow at Large. The programme was presented partly as a discussion between the two principals in the present day, interspersed with dramatised-documentary scenes set in the 19th century. The series discusses suspects and conspiracies, but concludes there is insufficient evidence to determine who was Jack the Ripper. The experiment was seen to be a success, and the formula was repeated in 1976 with Second Verdict, in which Barlow and Watt cast their gaze over miscarriages of justice and unsolved mysteries from the past.|$|R
50|$|Butler was {{far from}} a typical policeman, he had a {{meteoric}} rise through the ranks, going from <b>detective</b> sergeant to <b>chief</b> <b>superintendent</b> in under a decade. Butler was utterly committed to his work, as a lifelong bachelor who {{lived with his mother}} in West London. He was a non-smoker and only moderate drinker.|$|R
5|$|The {{case was}} {{referred}} to the Independent Police Complaints Commission (IPCC) on 16 September 2009 {{to determine whether there}} was evidence of misconduct or negligence by the police during the original murder investigation, the handling of Lace’s confession in 1983 and the request from Hodgson’s solicitors in 1998 for forensic examination of exhibits. The head of Southampton CID, <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Shirley Dinnell, stated that the referral was voluntarily made by Hampshire Constabulary because of the miscarriage of justice that had taken place and to ensure transparency of inquiries.|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Roy Ranson arrived at Lower Belgrave Street early on Friday 8November, the divisional surgeon had {{pronounced}} Sandra Rivett dead and forensic officers and photographers {{had been called}} to the property. Other than the front door, which the first two officers on the scene had kicked in, {{there was no sign}} of a forced entry. A bloodstained towel was found in Veronica's first-floor bedroom. The area around the top of the basement staircase was heavily bloodstained. A bloodstained lead pipe lay on the floor. Pictures hanging from the staircase walls were askew and a metal banister rail was damaged. At the foot of the stairs, two cups and saucers lay in a pool of blood. Rivett's arm protruded from the canvas sack, which lay in a slowly expanding pool of blood. The light fitting at the bottom of the stairs was missing its bulb; one was noted nearby, on a chair. Blood was also found on various leaves in the adjoining rear garden.|$|E
25|$|The {{character}} {{was not present}} {{at the start of}} the fourth, final series, and his role was taken by other superiors such as Detective Chief Inspector Anderson, played by Richard Wilson and <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Braithwaite, played by Benjamin Whitrow. Haskins returned a few episodes into the fourth series. There are two versions of the fourth series opening credits - with and without Haskins.|$|E
50|$|Ray Smith (1 May 1936 - 15 December 1991) was a Welsh {{actor who}} played the tough-talking police <b>chief,</b> <b>Detective</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Gordon Spikings, in the {{television}} series, Dempsey and Makepeace. He was the first actor to play Brother Cadfael for BBC radio.|$|R
5000|$|A {{colleague}} of Banks from {{his time in}} London, <b>Detective</b> <b>Superintendent</b> (later <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent)</b> Richard [...] "Dirty Dick" [...] Burgess, is another perennial character who appears {{in many of the}} novels. Initially hostile to Banks when they first met, they become good friends over time and have established a natural (if still slightly edgy) rapport by the early 21st century.|$|R

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of Norris' conviction, the British media drew comparisons with Harold Shipman, Britain's most prolific serial killer who killed more than 250 patients by lethal injections. <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Chris Gregg, {{who worked on the}} Shipman case and led the Norris investigation, was convinced that Colin Norris would have gone on to kill considerably more people if he had not been not stopped in his tracks.|$|E
25|$|The series {{reflected}} {{the fact that}} it was made during a dark period for the real-life Flying Squad, which in the late 1970s had been publicly censured for being involved in bribery, police corruption and excessively close links with the criminal fraternity. The actual commander of the Flying Squad, <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Kenneth Drury, was convicted of five counts of corruption and imprisoned for eight years on 7 July 1977 (an incident which formed a plot element in the 1978 movie, Sweeney 2). An internal investigation, called Operation Countryman, was then launched to stamp out corruption.|$|E
25|$|The Gardaí {{also had}} an agent close to the RIRA at the time. The agent, Paddy Dixon, stole cars for the RIRA, who used them to {{transport}} bombs. Days before the bombing, the RIRA had Dixon steal the maroon Vauxhall Cavalier it would use in the attack. Dixon immediately told his handler; Detective Sergeant John White. On 12 August, White passed this on to his superior; <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Dermot Jennings. According to White, Jennings told him that they would let the bomb go through, mainly so that the RIRA would not become suspicious of Dixon.|$|E

50|$|From January 1954 {{there was}} one {{superintendent}} grade I and one chief inspector in each sub-division, and one <b>chief</b> <b>superintendent,</b> one superintendent grade II and one detective superintendent grade I in each division. A <b>detective</b> <b>chief</b> inspector was added in each division later in 1954.|$|R
25|$|A full {{investigation}} was conducted into the allegations by David Douglas– a former Metropolitan Police <b>detective</b> <b>chief</b> <b>superintendent,</b> {{and head of}} the WPBSA's disciplinary committee. The independent tribunal that followed on 7–8 September, hosted by Sports Resolutions (UK) and chaired by Ian Mill QC, concurred that the WPBSA was right to conclude that Higgins had truthfully accounted for his words and actions and to withdraw the more serious charges of match-fixing, but found him guilty of 'giving the impression' he would breach betting rules, and of failing to report the approach made by the News of the World. Higgins received a six-month ban, backdated to the start of his suspension period, and was fined £75,000.|$|E
25|$|In {{order for}} the Emergency Response Unit to be {{deployed}} in the Dublin Metropolitan Region (DMR), a request must {{be made by the}} Divisional Officer to either the <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> of the Special Detective Unit, or the Assistant Commissioner in charge of the Crime & Security Branch. For operations in the other five Garda regions (Eastern, Northern, Southern, South-Eastern and Western), the Divisional Officer would make the request to the appropriate Assistant Commissioner of that region. Outside of Dublin, the relevant Regional Support Unit (RSU) is usually deployed first, and may then request support from the ERU. The ERU aims to respond to any incident within the mainland of the Republic of Ireland within 60 minutes of being dispatched, and within 2 hours outside of this (islands, watercraft, oil platforms, at sea, etc.), this may be achieved through the use of vehicles, watercraft or aircraft. The ERU may assume responsibility from the Irish Prison Service in the event they are not able to bring under control prison riots and may also be deployed to assist with escorting dangerous prisoners.|$|E
500|$|The defence {{argued that}} the first {{officers}} to enter the farmhouse had inadvertently disturbed the crime scene, then reconstructed it. Crime-scene photographs not {{made available to the}} original defence show Sheila's right arm and hand in slightly different positions in relation to the gun, which is lying across her body. The gun itself also appears to have moved. Former Lancashire <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Mick Gradwell, shown the photographs by the Guardian and Observer, said in 2011: [...] "The evidence shows, or portrays, Essex police having damaged the scene, and then having staged it again {{to make it look like}} it was originally. And if that has happened, and that hasn't been disclosed, that is really, really serious." ...|$|E
50|$|A {{police officer}} with investigative duties, {{up to and}} {{including}} the rank of <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent,</b> is a <b>detective</b> and the word Detective is prefixed to their rank (e.g. <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> Inspector), except for the rank of Police Constable where the word Police is omitted, making them a Detective Constable.|$|R
50|$|In January 1968 {{after six}} years with the Flying Squad, {{and most of the}} wanted Train Robbers caught, Slipper decided to return to Division and gained {{promotion}} to <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> Inspector in September of that year.

5000|$|The Prime Suspect series, (1991-2006) - {{featuring}} Helen Mirren as <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> Inspector (later <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent)</b> Jane Tennison, {{which focused}} on the police investigations and on Tennison's conflicts with her fellow officers as a prominent female detective in a heavily male-dominated work environment, {{as well as her}} personal problems concerning her family and after-work life.|$|R
500|$|The last {{confirmed}} {{sighting of}} Lucan was at about 1:15am on 8November 1974 as he exited {{the driveway of}} the Maxwell-Scott property, in his friend's Ford Corsair. Since then, his whereabouts and ultimate fate remain a mystery. <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Roy Ranson initially claimed that Lucan had [...] "done the honourable thing" [...] and [...] "fallen on his own sword", a view publicly repeated by many of Lucan's friends, including John Aspinall, who {{shortly before his death}} in 2000 said he believed the earl was guilty of Rivett's murder, and that his body lay [...] "250feet under the Channel". Veronica Lucan believes her husband killed himself [...] "like the nobleman he was".|$|E
500|$|The {{body was}} {{positively}} identified {{as that of}} Figard the following day. The post mortem determined she had been strangled and bludgeoned with a heavy implement, but did not establish which was fatal. The autopsy revealed [...] "no obvious signs" [...] of sexual assault, but {{it was determined that}} sexual intercourse had taken place shortly before her death, and detectives believed it had occurred against her will. Police said that the body had been there for about twenty-four hours and were working on the theory that she had been held captive before being killed. <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> Roger Hoddinott of Hampshire Police said at the time of discovery, Figard had been dead for at least four to five days, but did not announce a time of death.|$|E
500|$|The {{investigation}} {{was led by}} <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> John McCammont of West Mercia Police, and involved more than 100 detectives from three police forces. Officers examined similar unsolved murders amid concerns that they could all {{be the work of}} the same individual. Of particular interest were the recent murders of Tracey Turner and Samo Paull, whose bodies were also found on motorways after they had been strangled. McCammont ruled out a link at a press conference on 4 January: [...] "I would stress that at this stage there is no firm evidence whatsoever to link Celine's murder with any other investigations." [...] He appealed for information concerning a bottle of Pascal Chretien champagne, a gift given to Figard before she came to England: [...] "This particular type of champagne is not exported to anywhere in the world outside France and is not sold in this country. It is a 1993 vintage and only 60,000 bottles have been produced." ...|$|E
5000|$|After wartime {{service with}} the RAF {{he joined the}} Paisley Burgh Police rising {{to the rank of}} <b>Detective</b> <b>Chief</b> Inspector. Joining the Renfrew and Bute Constabulary as a <b>Chief</b> <b>Superintendent</b> in 1968 he rose to be its Assistant Chief Constable. In 1970 he was {{appointed}} Chief Constable of the Stirling and Clackmannan Force; and in 1975 of the newly formed Central Scotland Police Service.|$|R
25|$|On 28 June 2017, it was {{announced}} that six people were to be charged with offences in relation to the disaster.

He faces no charge in respect of the death of Tony Bland, who died four years after the disaster. Former Chief Inspector Sir Norman Bettinson faces four counts of misconduct in public office. Former Sheffield Wednesday F.C. Club Secretary Graham Mackrell faces a charge of breaching the Safety at Sports Ground Act 1975.
