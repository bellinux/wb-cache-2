50|$|The dating of <b>Jubilees</b> {{has been}} {{problematic}} for biblical scholars. While the oldest extant copies of <b>Jubilees</b> {{can be assigned}} {{on the basis of}} the handwriting to about 100 BC, there is much evidence to suggest <b>Jubilees</b> was written prior to this date.|$|R
50|$|The first biblical scholar {{to propose}} an origin for <b>Jubilees</b> was Robert Henry Charles (1855-1931). Charles {{proposed}} {{the author of}} <b>Jubilees</b> {{may have been a}} Pharisee and that <b>Jubilees</b> was the product of the midrash which had already been worked on in the Tanakh/Old Testament Books of Chronicles. However, with the discovery of the Dead Sea Scrolls (DSS) at Qumran in 1947, Charles' Pharisaic hypothesis of the origin of <b>Jubilees</b> has been almost completely abandoned.|$|R

5|$|Hyde Park {{has been}} a major venue for several Royal jubilees and celebrations. For the Golden <b>Jubilee</b> of Queen Victoria in 1887, a party was {{organised}} on 22 June where around 26,000 school children were given a free meal as a gift. The Queen and the Prince of Wales made an unexpected appearance at the event. Victoria remained fond of Hyde Park in the final years of her life and often drove there twice a day. As part of the Queen's Silver <b>Jubilee</b> in 1977, a <b>Jubilee</b> Exhibition was set up in Hyde Park, with the Queen and Prince Philip visiting on 30 June. In 2012, a major festival took place in the park as part of the Queen's Diamond <b>Jubilee</b> celebrations.

5000|$|The Book of <b>Jubilees</b> {{claims to}} present [...] "the {{history of the}} {{division}} of the days of the Law, of the events of the years, the year-weeks, and the <b>jubilees</b> of the world" [...] as revealed to Moses (in addition to the Torah or [...] "Instruction") by angels while he was on Mount Sinai for forty days and forty nights.

5000|$|In the Genesis flood {{narrative}} {{the author}} explains how God was noticing [...] "how corrupt the earth had become, {{for all the}} people on earth had corrupted their ways" [...] (Genesis 6:12). In <b>Jubilees</b> the sins of man are attributed to [...] "the unclean demons who began to lead astray the children of the sons of Noah, and to make to err and destroy them" [...] (<b>Jubilees</b> 10:1). In <b>Jubilees</b> Mastema questions the loyalty of Abraham and tells God to [...] "bid him offer him as a burnt offering on the altar, and Thou wilt see if he will do this command" [...] (<b>Jubilees</b> 17:16). The discrepancy between the story in <b>Jubilees</b> and the story in Genesis 22 exists with the presence of Mastema. In Genesis, God tests the will of Abraham merely to determine whether he is a true follower, however; in <b>Jubilees</b> Mastema has an agenda behind promoting the sacrifice of Abraham's son, [...] "an even more demonic act than that of the Satan in Job." [...] In <b>Jubilees,</b> where Mastema, an angel tasked with the tempting of mortals into sin and iniquity, requests that God give him a tenth of the spirits of the children of the watchers, demons, in order to aid the process. These demons are passed into Mastema’s authority, where once again, an angel is in charge of demonic spirits.|$|R

50|$|The Book of <b>Jubilees</b> {{had great}} {{influence}} on the formation of Islam. In the Book of <b>Jubilees</b> there is the very same concept of revelation as in Islam: God's words and commandments are eternally written on celestial tablets. An angel reveals their content to a prophet (2, 1; 32, 21 f.). Abaham's role in the Book of <b>Jubilees</b> corresponds to Abraham's role in the Quran {{in more than one}} way. The interpretation of biblical figures as prophets, is also rooted in the Book of <b>Jubilees.</b> Also numerology, the emphasis on angels, and the symbolism of anniversaries found their way into Islam, such as the fact that many important events in the prophet's biography as presented by Ibn Ishaq happen on the same date.|$|R
40|$|Whereas nineteenth-century {{university}} <b>jubilees</b> traditionally led to {{the writing}} of histories that celebrated an individual university, in this volume they have inspired instead a stimulating comparative approach that studies <b>jubilees</b> themselves across Northern Europe. Starting from the bicentenary of Helsinki University in 1840 and finishing {{with the opening of}} the University of Iceland in 1911, this book focuses on the importance of these <b>jubilees</b> for the development of Scandinavist ideas and increasing cultural and scientific cooperation between the Nordic countries. Can these <b>jubilees</b> be regarded as the driving force of increasing Nordic cooperation? The analysis here shows that university and political authorities have always sought the right balance between the national, regional (in casu Nordic) and international character of their celebration...|$|R
