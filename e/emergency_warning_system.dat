30|$|The main {{contribution}} of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> delivers drivers a braking warning signal earlier by DSRC communication. Via vehicle-to-vehicle communication, the <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> signal will be broadcast and the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time. Therefore, drivers behind can receive an immediate <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> while the front vehicle emergency brakes. Since the transmission time is much shorter than the human reaction time, the driver in car C can {{be aware of the}} emergency braking of car A before the driver in car B brakes and its braking light comes on, as shown in Figure  4. Consequently, the early warning mechanism is the concept of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> <b>system.</b> Now that active safety applications have become mature, cooperative communication technology to achieve improved safety will be the future trend.|$|R

[...] The Alberta government committed to spending more than CA$1 million to expanding the province's <b>emergency</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> so that it could be used effectively for Amber Alerts.

Considerable problems occurred removing men from the mine who were still alive. Many became trapped as they were working in remote stopes and didn't know of the fire until it was far too late, as there was no <b>emergency</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> operating in the mine.

50|$|Vehicles {{traveling}} {{in the vicinity of}} an accident scenario, for example, are simultaneously queried by the in-vehicle police intelligent beacon system computer which repeatedly updates and processes all dynamic passing vehicle data received, identifying and classifying all passing vehicles in real-time - for example, an aural visual command instruction is sent to all the in-vehicle <b>emergency</b> <b>warning</b> beacon <b>system</b> computers as a reminder that no rubbernecking, for example, or viewing of the accident is permitted and vehicles are instructed to safely maintain a given speed limit. Ease of managing, operating, and reducing traffic congestion of the transportation system is therefore achieved.|$|R

40|$|AbstractEmergency alert systems {{serve as}} a {{critical}} link {{in the chain of}} crisis communication, and they are essential to minimize loss during emergencies. Acts of terrorism and violence, chemical spills, amber alerts, nuclear facility problems, weather-related emergencies, flu pandemics, and other emergencies all require those responsible such as government officials, building managers, and university administrators to be able to quickly and reliably distribute emergency information to the public. This paper presents our design of a deep-learning-based <b>emergency</b> <b>warning</b> <b>system.</b> The proposed system is considered suitable for application in existing infrastructure such as closed-circuit television and other monitoring devices. The experimental results show that in most cases, our system immediately detects emergencies such as car accidents and natural disasters...|$|E

30|$|The main {{objective}} of the proposed cooperative <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> is to provide drivers with a braking warning signal without the obscurity due to weather factors. The proposed braking <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> combines dedicated short-range communication (DSRC) and image recognition technology to minimize the positioning error from vehicle-to-vehicle communication. With vehicle-to-vehicle communication, drivers can achieve higher braking warning accuracy when the vehicle ahead of the vehicle in front emergency brakes, especially in bad weather or when the front view is obstructed by another vehicle. Moreover, the proposed system changes the message transmission coverage based on the distance and direction from the emergency braking vehicle and different weather factors. In this way, drivers can eliminate unnecessary warnings and achieve a more accurate braking warning quality.|$|R

30|$|Safety {{applications}} in vehicular networks have been popular research topics in recent years, such as forward collision <b>warning,</b> <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> and intersection collision <b>warning</b> <b>systems.</b> The basic safety message broadcast from each car transmits the position, car speed and car heading information. Neighbouring cars receiving this information can decide {{if there is}} any danger within the next second. However, the safety application message has positioning accuracy and time-critical problems. Accurate positioning of the car provides a more effective warning to the driver. Moreover, the reliable and efficient delivery of safety information needs to be improved when the penetration rate increases. Hence, this paper proposes a cooperative <b>emergency</b> braking <b>warning</b> <b>system</b> to solve the above problems. This is a system that integrates a camera sensor to construct the state of neighbourhood cars in order to solve the first problem. It then proposes to reduce the repeat and derivable information between the broadcast messages in order to solve the second problem. The proposed system has been implemented to provide a safer driving environment.|$|R
