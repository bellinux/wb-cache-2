2500|$|Peter Davison, {{the editor}} of Orwell's Complete Works, {{includes}} an interview with George Stuart, a contemporary of Orwell in Burma, who said that Orwell was transferred to Kathar as punishment for shooting an elephant. [...] "An elephant was considered a valuable asset to any timber firm...and Orwell would have been severely reprimanded for such unnecessary slaughter. It was {{not long after the}} incident that he was transferred from Moulmein to a quiet post in Upper Burma called Katha." [...] Davison also includes in the complete works a news item from the Rangoon Gazette, March 22, 1926 which describes a Major E. C. Kenny shooting an elephant in similar circumstances. When one biographer questioned his wife, Sonia Brownell, she replied, [...] "Of course he shot a fucking a [...] elephant. He said he did. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> doubt his word!" ...|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS. Why {{on earth}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> suspect me of joking? I never was more serious in my life.|$|E
6000|$|LORD CAVERSHAM. [Turning round, {{and looking}} at his son beneath his bushy eyebrows.] <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> really {{understand}} what you say, sir? ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'You will! <b>you</b> have. <b>You</b> <b>did</b> yesterday. <b>You</b> <b>do</b> <b>always.</b> <b>You</b> have no decency; {{you make}} {{no secret of}} your temper; you have exposed {{yourself}} to Mr Chuzzlewit a hundred times.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Doctor, {{all that}} may be; but <b>you</b> <b>do</b> not answer my question. Did Mr. Bathurst leave the army because he showed cowardice? If he <b>did,</b> and <b>you</b> know it, why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> invite him here? why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> praise him? why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> not say, 'In other respects this man {{may be good}} and estimable, but he is that most despicable thing, a coward'?" ...|$|R
60|$|LADY BROCKLEHURST (undisturbed). Pooh, {{what have}} I <b>done?</b> <b>You</b> <b>always</b> begged {{me to speak}} to the servants, Henry, and I merely wanted to {{discover}} whether the views you used to hold about equality were adopted on the island; it seemed a splendid opportunity, but Mr. Woolley has not a word on the subject.|$|R
6000|$|CAMPBELL. Look here, Agnes, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> {{shout at}} the top of your voice in this way when you {{converse}} in a sleeping-car? ...|$|E
60|$|MISS T. Then why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> {{stand out}} after {{half a dozen}} turns? I thought {{officers}} in the Army didn't tell fibs.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't mention it. I {{ought not}} to have {{disturbed}} you. You were having a nice sleep, of course. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> sleep on the floor?" ...|$|E
60|$|Concerning supper-toast (of which I feel {{bound to}} make some mention), <b>you</b> <b>did,</b> as <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do,</b> right, and exactly what was most {{agreeable}} to me.|$|R
40|$|If <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>do</b> what <b>you</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> <b>you</b> will <b>always</b> {{get what}} <b>you</b> <b>always</b> got. Air Traffic Controller (ATCO) {{shortages}} seem difficult to overcome worldwide. Some aspects of manpower needs are probably considered at too late a stage or their impact is underestimated. An ATCO Manpower Planning (MP) simulation model (LAMPS) {{has been developed}} to assess the overall MP process in relation to air traffic demand {{over a period of}} 15 years. LAMPS enables the various players/decision makers to increase awareness of the impact of MP policy decisions in the long term, thus providing a learning platform for improved decision making...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{try to keep}} my temper," [...] she said, [...] "and {{you call}} me heartless for <b>doing</b> it. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> were hard on me, and <b>you</b> <b>always</b> will be." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! {{it is of}} no consequence. I {{shall see}} her in January. But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> write such charming long letters to her, Mr. Darcy?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS BRIDGENORTH. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> call Lesbia my sister? Dont {{you know}} that it annoys her more than any of the rest of your tricks? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Not accidentally, Mr. Bathurst. Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> {{try to run}} {{yourself}} down? I {{suppose you}} will say next you saved my life by an accident." ...|$|E
5000|$|Gifford {{has been}} an {{integral}} part of bringing the American art form of Long Form Improvisation to Denmark. In September 2016 he was in the opening show at the first improv theatre in Denmark, Improv Comedy Copenhagen and said, “No matter what <b>you</b> are <b>doing,</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> have to allow time to laugh, smile and have fun. And creating that balance is incredibly important.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Partly through {{paying me}} to help you, I suppose. But it's not worth your while to apostrophise me, or the air, about it; what <b>you</b> want to <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> <b>do.</b> <b>You</b> were <b>always</b> in the front rank, and I was always behind." ...|$|R
6000|$|Peter made a good-natured face at Sammy. [...] "Which means, I suppose, {{that what}} I can't <b>do</b> <b>you</b> can. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>did</b> {{have a pretty}} good opinion of yourself, Sammy," [...] said he.|$|R
6000|$|... "Tonnerre! why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> {{bring in}} that malheureux [...] Nile?--Is it not {{enough that we}} were beaten--disgraced--destroyed--that a friend must tell us of it so often?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Granser, {{what for}} <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> say {{so much what}} nobody knows?" [...] he asked. [...] "Scarlet ain't anything, but red is red. Why don't you say red, then?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh nonsense, come along, {{show me the}} way. That's right, Robins, {{only your}} hands are so sticky. What, down here!--Oh, Wilmet, how d'ye do? what delicious work! <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> do it?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said [...] "that's the {{universal}} blunder nowadays. One must {{do the right}} thing. And we don't know the right thing, Marjorie. That's {{the very heart of}} the trouble.... Does this life satisfy <b>you?</b> If it <b>did</b> would <b>you</b> <b>always</b> be so restless?..." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mother," [...] said Clym, [...] "whatever <b>you</b> <b>do,</b> <b>you</b> will <b>always</b> be dear to me--that you know. But {{one thing}} I {{have a right}} to say, which is, that at my age I am old enough to know what is best for me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, {{never mind}} the doctor, mother," [...] said Bladud impatiently, with that slighting {{reference}} to the faculty which is but too characteristic of youth; [...] "what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> think ought to be <b>done?</b> <b>You</b> were <b>always</b> doctor enough for me when I was little; you'll do equally well now that I am big." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you think}} so?" [...] replied the young lady, in whose cheeks a lovely flush had not deepened. [...] "I call it hideous. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> {{come out and}} pray to that tree?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> ask that, mother?" [...] {{retorted}} Grace, {{with her}} growing irritation {{in regard to}} her patient intensified by the recent interview. [...] "I can't be with her the whole time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{knew that}} you would say so," [...] Myra said indignantly. [...] "Whatever you <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> say it is luck, as if luck could do everything. I have no {{patience}} with you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're {{not a bad}} fellow, Mac. Only you're a fool. When you're <b>doing</b> {{one thing}} <b>you</b> <b>always</b> want to <b>do</b> another. That's {{not the way to}} live." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, what {{nice things}} <b>you</b> say! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> know, I <b>always</b> admired your {{compliments}}? I think they're the most charming compliments in the world." ...|$|R
60|$|Every {{one wishes}} a Desdemona or Ophelia for a wife,--creatures who, {{though they may}} not <b>always</b> {{understand}} <b>you,</b> <b>do</b> <b>always</b> feel <b>you,</b> and feel with you.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you think?" [...] she {{answered}} {{in the most}} charming accents. Then, as if thinking {{that it was her}} turn to place a question: [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> smile when you speak?" ...|$|E
6000|$|For {{the first}} time in all their acquaintanceship, Jeff's pride broke, and he held her away from him, while his lips were pathetic, and he mourned, [...] "Why <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> try to hurt me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> {{understand}} why you do everything? Ought one to understand? People like my mother understand," [...] she reflected. [...] "Now I must go down to them, I suppose, and see what's happening." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is going}} to rain, so they won't come, I dare say; but father thought you'd like to be ready, in case they <b>do</b> call. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> see the boys, you know, though you harden your heart to the poor girls,' said Rob, who had heard from his brother about the morning visitations.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Dodo, do {{listen to}} what James says," [...] said Celia, [...] "else you will be getting into a scrape. <b>You</b> <b>always</b> <b>did,</b> and <b>you</b> <b>always</b> will, when <b>you</b> set about <b>doing</b> as <b>you</b> please. And I {{think it is a}} mercy now after all that you have got James to think for you. He lets you have your plans, only he hinders you from being taken in. And that is the good of having a brother instead of a husband. A husband would not let you have your plans." ...|$|R
60|$|Well, if Grizel {{had always}} loved him there was surely {{something}} fine and rare about Tommy. But what was it, Grizel? Why <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>always</b> love him, <b>you</b> who saw into him so well and {{demanded so much of}} men? When I ask that question the spirit that hovers round my desk to protect Tommy from me rocks her arms mournfully, as if she did not know the answer; it is only when I seem to see her as she so often was in life, before she got that wound and after, bending over some little child and looking up radiant, that I think I suddenly know why she always loved Tommy. It was because he had such need of her.|$|R
