40|$|Though cartographic {{production}} {{based on}} geographic information systems has proven benefits, {{a major obstacle}} to the wide acceptance of GIS {{as a tool for}} production cartography has been its inflexibility in allowing cartographers to make changes to the representations of geographic features on a feature by feature basis. Consequently, many cartographers work either solely in a vector commercial <b>graphics</b> <b>software</b> <b>package,</b> or they divide their work between GIS and <b>graphics</b> <b>software</b> <b>packages.</b> <b>Software</b> is being developed at ESRI based on the geodatabase to support map finishing in ArcGIS. Cartographer-centric tools allow users to modify feature symbolization and geometry. These tools work with the geodatabase and store changes as overrides that do not effect the underlying GIS data.
