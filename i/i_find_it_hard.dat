So dealing with rejection {{became a part of}} life.... All that has taken a toll, I guess. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to deal with praise. Today, when people say that I have made it and made it on my own, I feel like locking up myself somewhere... It scares me." ...|$|E

Blair observed, [...] "with {{all due respect to}} the Inspector General, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to understand how I could be criticized for violating conflict of interest standards when I didn't have any influence on the study".|$|E

5000|$|Carter has {{identified}} himself as a libertarian: [...] "I don't vote. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> both parties to be appalling and OK at the same time. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>harder</b> for anybody {{as they get older}} to feel 100 per cent strongly behind one party. There's lots more grey than when I was younger. I'm a libertarian." ...|$|R
2500|$|The role of DS Ellie Miller was {{the second}} role cast. Producer Jane Featherstone first {{suggested}} Olivia Colman {{for the role of}} Ellie Miller, to which Chibnall (having also had her in mind) immediately agreed. Chibnall then specifically wrote the role of Ellie Miller for Colman, hoping she would agree to join the cast. Colman remained Chibnall's first choice to play Miller, and there was consensus among the producers to offer the job to her without the need for an audition. Colman says she was immediately drawn to the role: [...] "From the off I really liked the idea of the story, a hard story and an upsetting one, but I liked the idea of a whole community being affected by something and I liked the character of Ellie. ... And I liked Ellie. <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to play a character if I can't feel any of me in them. Especially {{if you are going to}} be playing that person through the whole series you need to feel that connection." [...] She was also highly impressed with the script she read, calling the script one she [...] "couldn't put down" [...] and that she turned the pages [...] "frantically" [...] because it was such a good read. Colman says she also had heard that David Tennant and actress Vicky McClure were under consideration for roles as well, and she wanted very much to work with them. She accepted the role immediately after reading the script.|$|E
2500|$|There Buechner {{realized}} {{the challenge of}} writing without the structure of school life around him. He describes the creation of his next novel, The Entrance to Porlock, as follows: [...] "...the labor of writing which was so painful that <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard,</b> even now, to see beyond {{the memory of the}} pain to whatever merit it may have." [...] However, in 1968, Buechner received a letter from Charles Price, the chaplain at Harvard, inviting him to give the Noble Lectures series in the winter of 1969. His predecessors in this role were none other than Richard Niebuhr and George Buttrick, and Buechner was both flattered and daunted by the idea of joining so august a group. When he voiced his concerns, Price replied that he should write [...] "something in the area of [...] "religion and letters."" [...] Thence came the idea to write about the everyday events of life [...] "as the alphabet through which God, of his grace, spells out his words, his meaning, to us. So The Alphabet of Grace was the title I hit upon, and what I set out to do was to try to describe a single representative day of my life in a way to suggest what there was of God to hear in it." [...] This process showed Buechner {{a way out of the}} frustration he had felt while writing The Entrance to Porlock: by drawing on his own experience, he found the means to convey his thoughts through his writing.|$|E
2500|$|Church's {{personal}} life {{has often been}} portrayed in UK tabloid newspapers, inspiring the song [...] "Let's Be Alone" [...] on her album Tissues and Issues. At age 15 she was criticised for remarks she made about the behaviour {{of people in the}} aftermath of the 11 September 2001 attacks. At the Leveson Inquiry she stated that her comments were taken vastly out of context. In a 2006 interview with Davina McCall, she agreed being diplomatic was [...] "not in her nature". In November 2011, Church testified before the Leveson Inquiry about the media intrusion into her {{personal life}} stating [...] "I've been made a caricature for so long, and this person portrayed in the tabloids really isn't me. It's not the person I am, and it's had a massive impact on my career. As an artist, <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> to be taken seriously because my credibility has been blown to bits." [...] On 27 February 2012 Church accepted £600,000 in damages and costs in settlement of a lawsuit arising out of the News International phone hacking scandal. She had claimed that 33 stories about her that appeared in the News of the World were the product of illegal hacking into her family's voicemail. After the settlement was announced in open court she made a lengthy statement in which she said, [...] "I have also discovered that despite the apology which the newspaper has just given in court, these people were prepared to go to any lengths to prevent me exposing their behaviour. They are not truly sorry. They are just sorry they got caught." ...|$|E

6000|$|He laughed. [...] "We call Wisconsin a Western State. Of course, it's the ignorant {{prejudice}} of the New-Yorker, but <b>I</b> <b>find</b> <b>it</b> <b>hard</b> {{to think}} of you as actual residents of this far-away little town. I thought only miners lived here?" ...|$|E
