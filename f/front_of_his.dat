5|$|During the {{construction}} of the Northwestern Turnpike through Romney, the state superintendent for the project, Angus William McDonald, proposed building the thoroughfare through White's garden in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> residence.

It {{was the first time}} that Woodfull had played in a winning Test, after ten matches. He hit three centuries in the series, with 491 runs at 54.56 despite which Australia lost the Ashes 4–1. Woodfull ended the entire season with 854 runs at 85.40.|$|E
5|$|After the drawn Second Test, Simpson {{contracted}} chickenpox, so Booth {{was again}} captain for the Third Test in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home {{crowd at the}} SCG. It was an extra burden, as Booth had made only 49 runs {{in the first two}} Tests; his teammates felt that their captain had been too anxious following his struggles against Griffith in the Caribbean. However, there was to be no fairytale for Booth, who later admitted to being in psychological disarray; he was unaware if the rolling done on the pitch after the toss was legal, and Philpott arrived late and ran onto the field just as play was starting.|$|E

At 23:00 a small arms fight flared around {{the left side of}} A Company north of the tanks. This gunfire had lasted only two or three minutes when the A Company roadblock squads near the tanks received word by field telephone that the company was withdrawing to the original ridge positions and that they should do likewise.|$|E

5|$|Despite several {{problems}} {{during the third}} session on Saturday morning, Lewis Hamilton was fastest, setting a time of 1:12.070, just over {{a tenth of a}} second in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> teammate. Earlier in the session, he needed to return to pit lane due to a gear-selection problem which had caused him to temporarily stop on track and later spun at turn eleven. Vettel was again third fastest, more than six-tenths of a second behind Hamilton. He was followed by teammate Räikkönen, Valtteri Bottas and Nico Hülkenberg in the Force India, all more than a second slower than Hamilton.|$|E
5|$|Further unrest was {{triggered}} when an Imperial slave named Stephanus was robbed while travelling near Beth-horon. Troops sent by Cumanus {{to arrest the}} leading men of the nearby villages began plundering the area. One of them, finding {{a copy of the}} Torah, destroyed it in view of the villagers while shouting blasphemies. Angered by this insult to God and to the Jewish religion, a crowd of Jews confronted Cumanus at Caesarea Maritima, demanding that the guilty party should be punished. This time the governor acted decisively and ordered that the soldier responsible should be beheaded in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> accusers, temporarily restoring the calm.|$|E
5|$|Gilchrist {{made his}} Test match {{debut in the}} First Test against Pakistan at the Gabba in Brisbane in November 1999 {{becoming}} the 381st Australian Test cricketer. He replaced Healy, who was dropped after a run of poor form, despite the incumbent's entreaties to the selectors to allow him a farewell game in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> home crowd. Gilchrist's entry into the Test arena coincided with a dramatic rise in Australia's fortunes. Up to this point, they had played eight Tests in 1999, winning and losing three.|$|E

5|$|He {{was dressed}} in a strange way. A šajkača was pulled to the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E
5|$|Henry Fownes Luttrell, {{who married}} Margaret, Alexander's daughter, {{and took the}} Luttrell name, moved to Dunster in 1747. The couple {{redesigned}} and redecorated the castle in a Rococo style, including the extensive use of the recently invented and highly fashionable wallpaper. Henry Luttrell raised the ground height of the Lower Ward between 1764 and 1765 to extend the New Way all around to the <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> mansion, adding additional ornamental towers onto {{the inside of the}} Great Gatehouse in the process. A folly, Conygar Tower, was constructed by architect Richard Phelps to improve the view from the castle, and a larger park of 141 hectares (348acres) was built just to the south of the castle, requiring the eviction of a number of tenant farmers.|$|E
5|$|Henry's son Afonso Henriques succeeded him in {{the county}} and took on the same shield. In 1139, despite being outnumbered, he {{defeated}} an army of Almoravid Moors at the Battle of Ourique and proclaimed himself Afonso I, King of Portugal, in <b>front</b> <b>of</b> <b>his</b> troops. Following the official recognition by the neighbouring León, Afonso changed his shield in order to reflect his new political status. Sources state he charged the cross with five sets of an unspecified number of silver bezants (most likely large-headed silver nails), one set on the centre and one on each arm, symbolizing Afonso's newly gained right to issue currency.|$|E
