40|$|The primary {{photochemistry}} of p-benzoquinone (BQ) in {{aqueous solution}} at pH 7 has been studied by the spin trapping technique coupled with electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) detection. Both steady state and flash photolysis studies were carried out. <b>Optical</b> <b>flash</b> photolysis was also used to complement the study.;A formate competition experiment has been applied in a quantitative manner by deriving a condition for characterizing trapping of free hydroxyl radicals by the spin trap 5, 5 -dimethyl- 1 -pyrroline- 1 -oxide (DMPO) {{in aqueous solution}}. This method should {{prove to be a}} general one for the detection of free hydroxyl radicals in photochemical reactions.;The results of the study are explained by a mechanism which involves hydrogen atom abstraction from water by excited BQ; the semiquinone (BQH(.)) is formed and free hydroxyl radical (OH(.)) is released which can react with BQ to form the radical adduct BQ-OH(.). Subsequent reaction of BQ-OH(.) with BQ constitutes a secondary source of BQH(.).;A computerized <b>optical</b> <b>flash</b> photolysis <b>apparatus</b> has been assembled and applied to this study. A deconvolution method has been developed to improve the effective time resolution of the detection system. This allowed for estimation of rise times of kinetic traces down to 1 - 2 (mu) s despite the long tail (up to (TURN) 25 (mu) s) of the photolyzing lamp...|$|R

40|$|Background: In {{cases of}} meningioma {{surrounding}} the <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus,</b> this {{study sought to}} {{reduce the incidence of}} radiation-induced optical neuropathy resulting from gamma knife surgery (GKS) by dividing the treatment volume into 2 or 3 fractions. Methods: Four patients with a large skull base meningioma (1 male and 3 females; median age: 42 years; range: 33 – 43  yrs) were treated using volume-staged GKS. In stage I, the large basal part of the tumor (13. 2  mL; range: 3. 9 – 54. 7  mL) was treated with a marginal dose of 13. 5  Gy (range: 12 – 15  Gy). In stage II, treatment focused on the smaller upper portion of the tumor located close to the <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus</b> (4. 3  mL; range: 1. 5 – 16. 2  mL), and the marginal dose was 9  Gy (range: 8 – 10  Gy). Results: All patients tolerated the treatments well, and tumors regressed over a median follow-up period of 100. 5 months (range: 42 – 122  mos). Specifically, a 34 – 46 % reduction in tumor volume was observed. All four patients presented improvements in the neurological deficits observed prior to GKS treatment, albeit to varying degrees. No adverse effects of radiation or new visual deterioration were observed during the follow-up period. Furthermore, no evidence of new endocrine dysfunction or new cranial nerve neuropathy was observed within a follow-up period of 100. 5 months. Conclusion: The application of volume-staged GKS using snowman-shape design appears to be an effective approach to control tumor growth when treating benign meningiomas surrounding the <b>optical</b> <b>apparatus.</b> This approach enables the application of higher radiation dosages to facilitate tumor control while still preserving optic nerve function...|$|R

40|$|With the {{successful}} {{launch of the}} Swift Gamma-Ray Burst Explorer, people expected the prompt <b>optical</b> <b>flash</b> like GRB 990123 would be easily detected. However the fact that early <b>optical</b> <b>flash</b> have not been detected {{for a number of}} GRBs indicates the reverse shock must be suppressed. Here we explore the possibility that the <b>optical</b> <b>flash</b> may arise from the internal shock. We find that, under certain circumstance, the <b>optical</b> <b>flash</b> of GRB 990123 and GRB 060111 b can really be explained by the internal shock. For GRB 041219 a, the prompt optical emission was correlated with the gamma-ray emission, we explain this feature also in the internal shock scenario, the optical emission is the low energy extension of the gamma-ray emission, and we can restrict its redshift z ∼ 0. 2. As for GRB 050904, we have shown in previous paper that the <b>optical</b> <b>flash</b> was produced by synchrotron radiation and the X-ray flare was produced by the synchrotron-self-Compton mechanism. Therefore we conclude that the early <b>optical</b> <b>flash</b> of GRBs can usually come from the internal shock. Meanwhile since the condition to produce the <b>optical</b> <b>flash</b> is not easily satisfied, so the <b>optical</b> <b>flash</b> like GRB 990123 should not be common in GRBs. In addition, we also discussed the synchrotron-self-Compton effect in the internal shock model, and find that for different values of parameters, there would be soft gamma-ray (∼ 100 KeV), hard gamma-ray (∼ 10 MeV) and GeV flare accompanying the <b>optical</b> <b>flash.</b> For GRB like GRB 990123, a GeV flare with fluence about 10 − 8 erg cm − 2 s − 1 is expected, which may be detected by the GLAST satellite.
