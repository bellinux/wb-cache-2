5|$|The jealous {{attention}} which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the unities both of {{time and}} place has taken away the principle of perspective in the drama, and all the interest which objects derive from distance, from contrast, from privation, from change of fortune, from long-cherished passion; and contrasts our view of life from a strange and romantic dream, long, obscure, and infinite, into a smartly contested, three hours' inaugural disputation on its merits by the different candidates for theatrical applause.|$|E
5|$|An Environmental Protection Act in 1991 {{prohibited}} importing {{radioactive material}} for long-term storage or burial in Russia, but controversial legislation to allow imports for permanent storage {{was passed by}} the Russian Parliament and signed by President Putin in 2001. In the long term, the Russian plan is for deep geologic disposal. Most attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> locations where waste has accumulated in temporary storage at Mayak, near Chelyabinsk in the Ural Mountains, and in granite at Krasnoyarsk in Siberia.|$|E
5|$|Scholarship in {{the area}} of Jewish Christian studies has tended to be based on {{artificial}} constructs similar to those developed by the early Christian heresiologists, with the underlying assumption that all of the beliefs and practices of these groups were based on theology. This has led to the perpetuation of ideological definitions that fail {{to take into account the}} pluriformity of these groups, reflecting differences in geography, time periods in history, and ethnicity. With respect to Epiphanius, and the Ebionites in particular, insufficient attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the highly speculative nature of his theological constructs and his mixing together of disparate sources, including his use of a gospel harmony that may have had nothing to do with the Ebionite sect known to Irenaeus. In the end, he presents an enigmatic picture of the Ebionites and their place in early Christian history.|$|E

Considerable attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the removal or filling of unnecessary surface join gaps and resonant cavities. Where the F/A-18A-D used grilles to cover various accessory exhaust and inlet ducts, the F/A-18E/F uses perforated panels that appear opaque to radar waves at the frequencies used. Careful attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the alignment of many panel boundaries and edges, to direct reflected waves {{away from the}} aircraft in uniformly narrow angles.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of Indo-Tibetan Buddhism some {{progress}} has been made in the areas of women in early Buddhism, monasticism and Mahayana Buddhism.

25|$|Following {{the end of}} {{hostilities}} with the 1995 Dayton Agreement, there have been sustained efforts to reconcile the opposing factions.

For this reason special attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> prevent sparks and high surface {{temperatures in the}} ship and its equipment. In case of chemical spills, the ship can be overpressurized to prevent potentially toxic chemical substances from entering the ship and harming its crew.

25|$|As the Finnpusku {{system is}} {{designed}} to operate independently in the severe ice conditions of the Bothnian Sea, special attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the hull form. The spoon-shaped bow has a low stem angle to reduce icebreaking resistance and {{the sides of the}} barge are flared to prevent the combination from becoming immobilized by ice ridges and compressive ice fields. When the pusher is coupled to the barge, the deep stern notch forms a streamlined aftship with seakeeping characteristics similar to those of conventional ships.|$|E

The Government of Costa Rica understands tourism to be the primary driver of the national economy; therefore, more attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> improve the potable water systems throughout the country. Costa Rica has the highest demand of water, both in total and per capita measures. Per capita water usage is about 1860 L p/day amounting to 5% of total available groundwater and surfacewater. Remaining Central American countries use on average of 3% of total supplies.|$|E

The first time this issue has raised June 7, one delegate laymen offered to meet three requirements of the Russian Orthodox Church - the canonization of martyrs and confessors of the Cathedral of Russian condemnation declaration of Metropolitan Sergius (Stragorodsky) from 1927; rejection of ecumenism. Relations with the ROCOR Metropolitans were devoted to presentations Krutitsa Juvenal, Vienna Irenaeus (Zuzemilya), Archbishops Kirill of Smolensk, Saratov Pimen (Khmelevskiy), Yaroslavl Plato, Archpriest Basil Stoyanova priest Vitaly Shastina, Hieromonk Hilarion (Alfeyev) and others.|$|E
25|$|In {{the period}} from 1999 to 2016, {{increasing}} attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the risks posed by so-called laser pointers and laser pens. Typically, the sale of laser pointers is restricted to either class3A (<5nbsp&mW) or classnbsp&2 (<1nbsp&mW), depending on local regulations. For example, in the US, Canada and the UK, classnbsp&3A is the maximum permitted, unless a key actuated control or other safety features are provided. In Australia, classnbsp&2 is the maximum allowed class. However, because enforcement is often not very strict, laser pointers of classnbsp&2 and above are often available for sale even in countries where they are not allowed.|$|E
25|$|Critics {{have offered}} various {{interpretations of the}} film's message and its {{significance}} for the series. Particular attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the ambiguous imagery in the ending: set 700 years after the main events, the last scene depicts a statue of Caesar shedding a single tear as the Lawgiver recounts Caesar's story to an integrated audience of ape and human children. By one interpretation, the statue cries tears of joy because the species have broken the cycle of oppression, giving the series an optimistic finale. By another, the statue weeps because racial strife still exists, implying the dystopian future of Planet and Beneath is unavoidable.|$|E

25|$|The Indian Residential Schools Settlement Agreement (IRSSA) is an {{agreement}} between the government of Canada and approximately 86,000 Native Canadians who at some point were enrolled as children in the Canadian Indian residential school system, a system which was in place between 1879 and 1996.. The IRSSA recognized the damage inflicted by the residential schools and established a $2 billion compensation package for all former IRS students and, in particular, {{those who had been}} abused or otherwise harmed. The agreement, announced in 2006, was the largest class action settlement in Canadian history. As of December 2012 a total of $1.62 billion <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> 78,750 former students.|$|E
25|$|Particular {{attention}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> improving {{systems in}} recent reforms. Many industrial multiversities and specialist colleges have been established, strengthening some incomplete subjects and establishing new specialties, e.g., automation, nuclear power, energy resources, oceanography, nuclear physics, computer science, polymer chemistry, polymer physics, radiochemistry, physical chemistry and biophysics. A project for creating 100 world class universities began in 1993, which has merged 708 schools {{of higher learning}} into 302 universities. Merging schools of higher learning has produced far-reaching reform of higher education management, optimizing of educational resources allocation, and further improving teaching quality and school standards. More than 30 universities have received help from a special national fund to support their attainment of world elite class.|$|E
25|$|Black {{flight is}} a term applied to the out-migration of African Americans from {{predominantly}} black or mixed inner-city areas in the United States to suburbs and outlying edge cities of newer home construction. While more attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> this since the 1990s, the movement of blacks to the suburbs has been underway for some time, with nine million people having migrated from 1960 to 2000. Their goals have been {{similar to those of}} the white middle class, whose out-migration was called white flight: newer housing, better schools for their children, and attractive environments. From 1990 to 2000, the percentage of African Americans who lived in the suburbs increased to a total of 39 percent, rising 5 percent in that decade. Most who moved to the suburbs after World War II were middle class.|$|E

25|$|The Dome of the Rock {{with its}} {{inscriptions}} are interesting in the dating of the text. These inscriptions {{have been known}} to scholars {{for more than a century}} and have repeatedly been the subject of interpretation, yet little attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the elements from which they were composed. On the inner face of the octagon the declaration of faith is followed by conflated verses describing the powers of God. Next Muhammad is introduced, with a blessing that, though not directly quoted from the Quran, was clearly already in use in 694 AD. Then comes an exhortation to Christians that Jesus was also a prophet and mortal, followed by the claim that God is sufficient unto Himself. Finally comes a command to bend to His will and the threat of reckoning for those who do not.|$|E
25|$|Galápagos green turtles {{have been}} {{recorded}} and observed in the Galápagos {{as far back as}} the 17th century by William Dampier. Not much attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> them due to the overwhelming research done on the Galápagos giant tortoises. Only over the last 30 years have extensive studies been performed covering the behaviors of the Galápagos green turtles. Much of the debate that has surrounded them recently is over the binomial classification of the species. It is the only subpopulation of green sea turtle to be given premise for separate species delineation, proposing Chelonia agassizii as a separate species. At this time, no distinctions have been made, mainly due to analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of 15nesting beaches. This analysis has showed little distinction between the populations of the East Pacific waters and those of other nesting areas.|$|E
25|$|The Ultimatum caused violent anti-British sentiments in Portugal {{and demonstrations}} leading to riots.

Although much attention <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>paid</b> <b>to</b> the Portuguese reaction to the Ultimatum, less has been given to the attitude of the British government in using tactics that could have led to war, and it has been plausibly argued that Lord Salisbury, whose government was diplomatically isolated, feared being humiliated by a Portuguese success. The British government had also granted a Royal Charter to Rhodes’ British South Africa Company in October 1889, before it received news of Serpa Pinto's skirmish with the Makololo. This allowed the company to claim Mashonaland and also Manicaland and the Zambezi valley above Zumbo. Only Portugal had any claim to effective occupation of any part of the latter two areas.|$|E
