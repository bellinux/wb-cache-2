40|$|International audiencePurpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{influence}} of <b>eco-designed</b> packaging on consumers’ responses. It defines the concept of <b>eco-designed</b> packaging, and proposes a consumer-led taxonomy of its cues. Attitudinal and behavioral, positive and negative responses triggered by the perception of these signals are analyzed. Design/methodology/approach – Results were reached through qualitative methods. A phenomenological approach consisting of eight in-depth interviews has been followed by a series of ten Zaltman Metaphor Elicitation Technique (ZMET) interviews. The synergy of these two methods is underlined. Findings – The complexity of packaging ecological cues perception is outlined by expressing the differences in the nature of these cues. A taxonomy is then presented; ecological cues fall into three categories: structural cues, graphical/iconic cues and informational cues. Finally, consumers’ responses to the perception of <b>eco-designed</b> packaging are presented and perceived benefits and perceived sacrifices are revealed. Practical implications – Packaging is of great importance in consumers’ purchase decision process, especially in situations of temporal pressure and hyperchoice environments. Since consumers take more and more into account the ethicality of the brand in their consumption, the understanding of their attitudes and behaviors toward <b>eco-designed</b> packaging may enable brands to build a competitive advantage. Originality/value – The literature review reveals that there is no similar research available. The use of two qualitative methods enables to understand consumers’ deep-seated motivations, attitudes and behaviors toward <b>eco-designed</b> packaging. The results of this study can also be used by advertisers, for social marketing campaigns, to encourage consumers to reduce the global ecological footprint of packaging...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIndustrialising {{products}} and/or services, {{considering the}} current environmental situation, requires changing paradigms to be efficient. The paradigm of proposing systems {{of products and}} services instead of selling products is one of them. Moving further, this article shows that it can sometimes be possible to consider product and/or service degradation in order to relieve environmental burdens, while still maintaining user satisfaction. In this new paradigm, degradation will concern certain technical performances of the system. To succeed, the approach must simultaneously consider users’ expectations and environmental aspects. Environmental, economic and innovative approaches must be combined to adapt the products and services in an appropriate way. The product and service characteristics are negotiated with the users to cut down environmental impacts, while continuing to meet users’ satisfaction.

40|$|International audienceFor {{a growing}} number of firms, it is {{important}} that life-cycle assessments (LCAs) as well as the interpretation of the results obtained be carried out directly by the design teams. Unfortunately, the complexity of these two elements hinders the development of really <b>eco-designed</b> products. In this paper, we propose a generic approach allowing a company to develop a specific environmental assessment tool which enables designers to carry out simplified environmental assessments during the design process. To be more precise, the generic approach is based on the creation of two main features: impact functions to simplify the inherent complexity of LCAs and an environmental categorisation per product range to facilitate the use of environmental assessment results by the design team. This paper presents the development of such tool (named EcoT) in the context of automotive part suppliers and demonstrates its technical robustness on two case studies (dashboards and door panels). At the end of the paper, we discuss the usability and appropriability of the EcoT tool based on handling tests carried out by the company design team...|$|R

Effectiveness of the energy sustainable actions on the new developments: the case of Hammarby Sjöstad Stockholm {{is focused on the}} local approach and solutions for the district design, which have been recognized as fundamental for controlling energy demand, consumption and production. In particular, the role of the district design regards the possibility to adapt the urban grid to the climatic and environmental characteristics of a place (Breheny, 1992; Jenks et al., 2000), contributing in changing energy and environmental performance of a settlement, thanks also to the feasibility for planting energy saving/production technologies (Bell et al., 2003; Steemers et al., 2000).

40|$|Increasing {{resource}} efficiency by utilising {{secondary raw material}} {{is one of the}} key characteristics of a circular economy. Textile dust fibre, a waste generated from textile mechanical recycling has the prospect to be utilised as secondary raw material for producing novel material: textile paper suitable for packaging and other applications. A comparative Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) of carrier bags made from one ton of virgin paper, recycled paper and novel textile paper (~ 22584 paper bags with grammage of 100 g/m 2 and same dimensions for all 3 types of bags) showed that textile paper bag is more environmentally friendly in terms of carbon footprint. The largest environmental contributors were energy consumed in the pulping and paper making processes, followed by the use of adhesives and printing ink in the conversion process of paper to papercarrier bags. A comparative Techno-economic Assessment (TEA) was carried out for the operating cost of producing the three selected carrier bag types. The analysis conveyed that textile paper bags are more economically attractive, mainly due to the partial substitution of paper fibre with low-cost textile dust fibre. Furthermore, a simple tool was developed with an attempt to assess and compare materials suitability for the circular economy considering life cycle thinking and business perspectives. Assessment of textile paper using the Circular material assessment tool indicated that there is still scope for improvement on the following circularity characteristics of circular material: scarcity of raw material, local supply of resources, clean and non-toxic resources. Textile paper material scored high in the following circularity characteristics: secondary raw material, industrial symbiosis, recycling, {{resource efficiency}} in manufacturing and use. In the final step, the textile paper bag was <b>eco-designed</b> through the combined and iterative LCA and TEA approach with the aim to achieve improved scores as a circular material. In order to understand the overall sustainability advantages and trade-offs, further research is recommended on different textile dust fibre grades as well as textile paper performance based on mechanical properties. It is also recommended to investigate textile paper in other applications like one time fashion clothes, reusable paper bags as textile hangers etc...|$|R
