40|$|AbstractCivil {{servants}} {{in government}} <b>front</b> <b>offices</b> frequently lack subject matter expertise {{as well as}} necessary skills to meet modern citizen-centric service demands. Using design research, we discuss how <b>front</b> <b>offices</b> can change the service paradigm from administering government-centric and transaction-oriented services to providing truly citizen-centric services. We demonstrate that by means of “advisory information artifacts” civil servants can become expert advisors and eventually provide citizens with superior advisory services. Advisory information artifacts consist of a knowledge base, “counseling affordances” offering advisors moderation material and “service encounter thinkLets” covering the corresponding work practices. Such advisory information artifacts {{have the capacity to}} effectively support civil servants in acquiring the necessary advice-related skills while concurrently providing superior citizen-oriented services...|$|R

5|$|As {{the trade}} {{deadline}} approached, it was {{speculated that the}} Phillies would surrender older players to obtain younger ones. They made two deals, neither involving key components of the team. In August they had their best month of the season: a 14–13 record, thanks to strong pitching and adequate hitting. Although the Phillies began September with four pitchers combining for a no-hitter, their month deteriorated from there. The squad had an 11–15 record, finishing the season with 73 wins and 89 losses. Significant personnel changes {{on the field and}} in the <b>front</b> <b>office</b> were expected during the offseason.|$|E
5|$|Baseball America rated Humber as the 50th-best {{prospect}} {{in baseball}} {{heading into the}} 2005 season. Humber entered spring training in 2005 with the Mets. There, he clashed with Mets' pitching coach Rick Peterson, who wanted Humber to adopt a different training regimen and change the manner with which he threw {{the ball to the}} plate. The Mets <b>front</b> <b>office</b> supported Humber, telling him to pitch how he felt comfortable.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{called his}} new {{franchise}} the Bengals because Cincinnati had {{a team of}} that name in the 1930s and {{he thought it would}} provide a link to the past. Brown's son Mike joined the <b>front</b> <b>office</b> and became his father's top assistant and right-hand man. Brown brought in other assistants including Bill Johnson, Rick Forzano and Bill Walsh. In their first two seasons in 1968 and 1969, the Bengals fared poorly, but the team appeared to be on the upswing as Brown built up a core group of players through the draft, including quarterback Greg Cook.|$|E

5|$|In 1948, Krichell was {{involved}} in a minor scandal. Harry Nicolas was a high school baseball star in Long Island. The Yankees sent Krichell to scout him and offered him a contract with a blank check, being willing pay up to $20,000 for his services. As Nicolas was still in high school, the Yankees were fined $500 by Happy Chandler, the Commissioner of Baseball. Nicolas never reached the Majors. However, Krichell's recommendation of Casey Stengel for manager of the Yankees in 1948 was instrumental in their <b>front</b> <b>office</b> hiring him.|$|E
5|$|Just {{prior to}} the start of the 2014–15 season, Sakic was given the title of general manager while Sherman was demoted to {{assistant}} general manager, thus formalizing the de facto arrangement that had been in place since 2013.

5|$|The Avalanche's success came amid {{considerable}} {{turmoil in}} the <b>front</b> <b>office.</b> COMSAT's diversification into sports ownership was proving a drain on the company. In particular, cost overruns associated {{with the construction of}} Pepsi Center had shareholders up in arms. Finally, in 1997, COMSAT agreed in principle to sell Ascent to Liberty Media. However, Liberty was not interested in sports ownership at the time (though it has since bought Major League Baseball's Atlanta Braves), and made the deal contingent upon Ascent selling the Avalanche and Nuggets.|$|E
5|$|The Buccaneers first {{joined the}} NFL in 1976 {{as members of}} the AFC West. The {{following}} year, they moved to the NFC Central. The Tampa Bay expansion franchise was originally awarded to Tom McCloskey, a construction company owner from Philadelphia. It soon became apparent that McCloskey had financial problems, so the NFL found a replacement in Hugh Culverhouse. They were purchased by Malcolm Glazer in 1995 for $192 million, following Culverhouse's death. The <b>front</b> <b>office</b> staff of the team includes Bryan Glazer, Edward Glazer, and Joel Glazer.|$|E
50|$|Sports betting {{systems have}} not always been well trusted or liked by bettors. The stigma is that a {{sporting}} event has too many intangibles that a machine can't predict.
