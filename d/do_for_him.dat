5|$|The Advance Guard {{crossed the}} Rhine River at Kehl, and {{marched to the}} northeast. François Joseph Lefebvre was indisposed—suffering from ringworm—and Jourdan had {{appointed}} General of Division Dominique Vandamme to direct the march. Vandamme had been lobbying with Jourdan for a larger and more important command but, given the claims of other officers, {{this was the best}} Jourdan could <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Vandamme led the Advance Guard through the mountains via Freudenstadt. On 5 March, Lefebvre returned to his command. Within a week, part of the advance guard broke off from the main body and, under command of Vandamme, moved to Stuttgart, to investigate the rumored presence of Habsburg units.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the episode, flashbacks {{depict a}} young Sam (Ford) and Dean (Canipe) on Christmas Eve of 1991; {{with their father}} out on a hunt, the {{brothers}} are staying alone in a motel room until he returns. As Sam wraps an object he obtained from Bobby Singer as a present for his father, he begins to question Dean about what their father is doing. Although Dean brushes him off, Sam reveals that he has read their father's hunting journal. Dean acquiesces, and confirms that their father hunts monsters. This revelation terrifies Sam, who is afraid that the monsters will come after them. Later that night, Dean wakes Sam up and claims that their father briefly returned and left presents. When Sam's gifts {{end up being a}} Barbie doll and a sparkly baton, Dean admits that he stole them from a nearby house. Despite this, Sam appreciates what Dean tried to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> and gives him the gift meant for their fatherthe amulet necklace that Dean has worn ever since.|$|E
25|$|Eva {{appears at}} a church to take the sacrament {{in front of her}} adoring {{supporters}} ("Santa Evita"), but goes into a trancelike state, beginning to hallucinate. In her vision she and Che heatedly debate her actions; Che accuses Eva of using the Argentine people for her own ends and silencing people who do not support her, while Eva cynically replies that there is no glory in trying to solve the world's problems from the sidelines ("A Waltz for Eva and Che"). At the end of the argument, Eva finally admits to herself and Che that she is dying and can't go on for much longer. Afterwards, Eva finally understands that Perón loves her for herself, not just for what she can <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and his career ("You Must Love Me").|$|E

500|$|Several of the show's crew praise Bumpass for his {{performance}} and similitude to the character. Kenny called Bumpass [...] "brilliant" [...] and said, [...] " [...] {{is sort of}} like Squidward". Staff writer Kent Osborne said, [...] "I remember thinking about how much Rodger talks and acts like Squidward. That's why it's such a good voice—he's so connected to it". However, Bumpass said, [...] "I'm not him and he's not me, but what I'm required to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> and what I am enabled to <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> is what makes it like me. It fits my particular talents and skills very well. So in that respect, yeah, he is me, but I am not the cranky, sarcastic, underachieving kind of guy that he is. He's easy to fall in, I will say that." ...|$|E
500|$|Alexander {{stopped at}} Thermopylae, {{where he was}} {{recognized}} {{as the leader of}} the Amphictyonic League before heading south to Corinth. Athens sued for peace and Alexander pardoned the rebels. The famous encounter between Alexander and Diogenes the Cynic occurred during Alexander's stay in Corinth. When Alexander asked Diogenes what he could <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> the philosopher disdainfully asked Alexander to stand a little to the side, as he was blocking the sunlight. This reply apparently delighted Alexander, who is reported to have said [...] "But verily, if I were not Alexander, I would like to be Diogenes." [...] At Corinth, Alexander took the title of Hegemon ("leader") and, like Philip, was appointed commander for the coming war against Persia. He also received news of a Thracian uprising.|$|E

[...] grabbed his crotch and replied [...] "You know what's up." [...] On several occasions, Crawford continued, Hughes had pressed his crotch against the window of her office. On one occasion, when Crawford asked Hughes what she could <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> he grabbed her head and pulled it towards his crotch. Other allegations were made by two other women who worked with Hughes.|$|E

2500|$|Groove metal group Five Finger Death Punch had an {{incident}} when, during the song [...] "White Knuckles" [...] {{at a concert}} in Hartford Connecticut, a young man received a compound fracture on his ankle in a mosh pit. Ivan L. Moody, the band's lead singer, stopped the show, leaped into the crowd with Zoltan Bathory, the band's rhythm guitarist, and carried the injured fan onto the stage, where {{he was taken to}} the hospital. Moody has been quoted as saying: [...] "I looked him square in the face and asked him if he was okay, or if there was anything I could <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> He looked over at me, still in shock, and said 'You guys fucking rock!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|... on a {{life and}} death so full of heart-going realities as poor Chatterton's, to find such shadowy nobodies as cherub-winged Death, Trees of Hope, bare-bosomed Affection and simpering Peace, makes one's blood {{circulate}} like ipecacuanha. But it is so. A young man by strong feelings is impelled to write on a particular subject, {{and this is all}} his feelings <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> They set him upon the business and then they leave him. he has such a high idea of what poetry ought to be, that he cannot conceive that such things as natural emotions may be allowed to find a place in it; his learning therefore, his fancy, or rather conceit, and all his powers of buckram are put on the stretch.|$|E
2500|$|It is possible, as {{he wrote}} later, that he was warned {{by a group of}} merchants that there was a plot to murder him if he was to {{re-enter}} Rome. This claim could be merely an exaggeration to reinforce himself as a defender of Protestantism. However, Milton's theological frankness did limit what Manso could <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> as patron. A lingering reputation is suggested by what Nicolaas Heinsius, a Dutch poet, later wrote: [...] "That Englishman was hated by the Italians, among whom he lived a long time, on account of his over-strict morals, because he both disputed freely about religion, and on any occasion whatever prated very bitterly against the Roman Pontiff." [...] Regardless, these were all points that Milton later took pride in. He actually spent two months in Rome on his return journey.|$|E

2500|$|More {{detailed}} {{versions of}} the story largely alleged that Zhang Heng personally killed Emperor Wen by pounding his chest and breaking his ribs. [...] The advocates for the theory that Emperor Wen was killed on Emperor Yang's orders also pointed to other circumstantial evidence, including how immediately after Emperor Wen's death Emperor Yang took Consorts Chen and Cai as his concubines. [...] Further, after Zhang lost Emperor Yang's favors and eventually was executed in 612, Zhang lamented at the execution field, [...] "What did I <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>him</b> that I can expect to live long?" [...] The warden, apparently believing in the murder theory himself, immediately covered his ears to avoid hearing any details and had Zhang immediately executed. [...] They further pointed out how Liu Shu and Yuan Yan were exiled and Yang Yong executed immediately following Emperor Wen's death.|$|E
2500|$|It was in Corinth that {{a meeting}} between Alexander the Great and Diogenes is {{supposed}} to have taken place. These stories may be apocryphal. The accounts of Plutarch and Diogenes Laërtius recount that they exchanged only a few words: while Diogenes was relaxing in the morning sunlight, Alexander, thrilled to meet the famous philosopher, asked if there was any favour he might <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>him.</b> Diogenes replied, [...] "Yes, stand out of my sunlight." [...] Alexander then declared, [...] "If I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes." [...] "If I were not Diogenes, I would still wish to be Diogenes.", Diogenes replied. In another account of the conversation, Alexander found the philosopher looking attentively at a pile of human bones. Diogenes explained, [...] "I am searching for the bones of your father but cannot distinguish them from those of a slave." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kierkegaard says, [...] "all who {{are expecting}} {{do have one}} thing in common, that they are expecting {{something}} in the future, because expectancy and the future are inseparable ideas." [...] But many people live in [...] "conflict with the future" [...] Yet, [...] "by the eternal, one can conquer the future, because the eternal is the ground of the future, and therefore through it the future can be fathomed. What, then, is the eternal power in a human being? It is faith. What is the expectancy of faith? Victory-or, as Scripture so earnestly and so movingly teaches us, that all things must serve for good those who love God." [...] Kierkegaard writes about expectancy once more in these discourses. Expectancy has to do with hope. [...] "The healthy individual lives simultaneously in hope and in recollection, and only thereby does his life gain true and substantive continuity. Thus he has hope and therefore does not wish to go backward in time, as do those who live only in recollection. What, then, does recollection <b>do</b> <b>for</b> <b>him,</b> for it certainly must have some influence? It places a sharp on the note of the moment; the further back it goes, the more often the repetition, the more sharps there are. For example, if in the present year he experiences an erotic moment, this is augmented by his recollection of it in the previous year etc. … Hope hovers over it as a hope of eternity that fills out the moment.|$|E
