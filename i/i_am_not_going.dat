5|$|I was {{of course}} happy to meet the Hizbullah people, {{because it is a}} point of view that is rarely heard in the United States. I have no problem saying that I do want to express {{solidarity}} with them, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be a coward of (sic) a hypocrite about it. I don't care about Hizbullah as a political organization. I don't know much about their politics, and anyhow, it's irrelevant. I don't live in Lebanon. It's a choice that the Lebanese have to make: Who they want to be their leaders, who they want to represent them. But there is a fundamental principle. People have the right to defend their country from foreign occupiers, and {{people have the right to}} defend their country from invaders who are destroying their country. That to me is a very basic, elementary and uncomplicated question.|$|E
500|$|In 2005, he also feuded with {{democracy}} activist Martha Beatriz Roque, accusing her of collaborating with security forces to provide justification {{for a further}} crackdown. Although his political activity was tolerated and on a few occasions {{he was allowed to}} travel abroad, Payá reported that both he and his family were subject to routine intimidation: [...] "I have been told that I am going to be killed before the regime is over but <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to run away." ...|$|E
500|$|In {{more recent}} years, frontwoman Love {{stated that the}} album {{contains}} [...] "nothing melodic". In a 2011 interview for Hit So Hard (2011), a documentary on later Hole drummer Patty Schemel, Love referred to Pretty on the Inside as [...] "unlistenable", going on to say: [...] "That record was a calling card for rock critics and hardcorers, [...] 'This is what I do, and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to back down from it. I am announcing my persona as a cunt. Thank you very much.'" ...|$|E

I can't {{be part of the}} propaganda machine; <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to feed the public lies." [...] Many international journalists in Egypt covering the protests were detained, beaten, shouted at or threatened by pro-Mubarak protesters, as were numerous Egyptian bloggers and activists including Wael Abbas. Two Al Jazeera reporters were attacked as they arrived from the airport while three others were arrested and later released.|$|E
500|$|On March 24, 1863, at the Court's suggestion, the {{government}} filed a nolle prosequi motion and Jackalow was discharged. Jackalow was admonished {{to leave the}} country and never return, and he complied. Three years after Jackalow's first trial, {{the government}} was unable to locate witnesses for a retrial and persisted in [...] Justice Grier, again riding circuit, reportedly stated: [...] "If the Supreme Court of the United States can't make up its mind whether the place where the murder was committed was within the jurisdiction of the states or on the high seas, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to come so near committing judicial murder as to set twelve men guessing at it." ...|$|E
500|$|Reagan's {{opponent}} in the 1984 presidential election was former Vice President Walter Mondale. With questions about Reagan's age, and a weak performance in the first presidential debate, his ability {{to perform the duties}} of president for another term was questioned. His apparent confused and forgetful behavior was evident to his supporters; they had previously known him clever and witty. Rumors began to circulate that he had Alzheimer's disease. Reagan rebounded in the second debate, and confronted questions about his age, quipping, [...] "I will not make age an issue of this campaign. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to exploit, for political purposes, my opponent's youth and inexperience," [...] which generated applause and laughter, even from Mondale himself.|$|E

500|$|As it {{continued}} eastward, Epsilon developed characteristics of an annular hurricane; such cyclones, more {{often found in}} the deep tropics with greater intensity, have circular eyes, surrounded by a nearly uniform ring of convection and {{a general lack of}} thunderstorms outside the ring. For several days, the intensity fluctuated in a narrow range, and although Epsilon was briefly downgraded to tropical storm status on December4, the NHC assessed it as remaining a hurricane. After it was thought to have weakened, the eye became more symmetric as the ring of convection became stronger. The hurricane remained difficult to forecast, as NHC forecaster Lixion Avila remarked, [...] "There are no clear reasons... and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to make one up... to explain the recent strengthening of Epsilon." ...|$|E
500|$|Given the UFA's formal {{adoption}} of the goal of replacing Stewart's Liberal government with a Farmer government, it remained surprisingly friendly towards the Premier. While campaigning for Moore during the Cochrane by-election, Wood called Stewart [...] "an honourable, upright citizen, doing {{the best he could}} under difficult circumstances" [...] and boasted that [...] "if I have got to tear down the character of an honourable man to build up something that I want, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to build it up." [...] When at last the general election came, in 1921, the UFA declined to run a candidate in Stewart's Sedgewick riding as a sign of respect to the Premier. After the UFA swept to victory, there was even speculation that Stewart, still a UFA member, would stay on as Premier of a new Farmer's government (as part of its opposition to [...] "old style politics," [...] the UFA had contested the election without designating a leader), but he announced otherwise.|$|E
500|$|Supporters of Rangel {{argued that}} by {{comparison}} with previous cases, a reprimand {{would be a more}} fitting punishment for Rangel's trangressions than censure. [...] Rangel repeatedly insisted, as he had all along, that nothing he had done was with the aim of enriching himself. [...] It was to no avail. [...] On December 2, 2010, a motion was made in the full House to censure Rangel. [...] Ethics committee chair Zoe Lofgren emphasized that it was Rangel's [...] "accumulation of actions" [...] that warranted the stiffer penalty, and said that the treatment of Rangel should set a new precedent, not follow old ones. [...] A motion to amend the resolution in favor of reprimand was voted down 267–146; most of Speaker Pelosi's allies rejected it and over 105 Democrats voted the resolution down. [...] The House of Representatives then voted 333–79 to censure Rangel. Per custom, Rangel went to the well of the House to hear Speaker Pelosi solemnly read the formal measure of censure. It had been 27 years since the last such measure and Rangel was only the 23rd House member to be censured. Rangel asked to speak and said, [...] "I know in my heart <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be judged by this Congress. I’ll be judged by my life in its entirety." ...|$|E

500|$|As an {{openly gay}} man {{throughout}} his career, Sylvester {{came to be}} seen as a spokesman for the gay community. He informed a journalist that [...] "I realize that gay people have put me on a pedestal and I love it. After all, of all the oppressed minorities, they just have to be the most oppressed. They have all the hassles of finding something or someone to identify with [...] and they chose me. I like being around gay people and they've proven to be some of my closest friends and most loyal audiences." [...] Elsewhere, he nevertheless remarked that he felt his career had [...] "transcended the gay movement. I mean, my sexuality has nothing to do with my music. When I'm fucking I'm not thinking about singing and vice versa." [...] He was openly critical of what he perceived as divisive tendencies within the gay community itself, noting that [...] "I get this conformist shit from queens all the time. They always want to read me. They always want me to do it their way. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to conform to the gay lifestyle as they see it and that's for sure". He was particularly critical of [...] "clones" [...] gay men who dressed alike with boots, boot-cut jeans, checked shirts and handlebar mustaches [...] stating that all too often they judged those gay people who were flamboyant or extravagant.|$|E
500|$|Lennon's quote was {{featured}} in a 3 July article in The New York Times Magazine and provoked no reaction. In late July, when Datebook republished the interviews, editor Art Unger put Lennon's quote [...] "I don't know which will go first—rock 'n' roll or Christianity!" [...] on the cover. Also on the cover was a quote from Paul McCartney regarding America: [...] "It's a lousy country where anyone black is a dirty nigger!" [...] In Birmingham, Alabama, WAQY DJ Tommy Charles heard about Lennon's remarks from his coworker Doug Layton, and was immediately incensed, saying, [...] "That does it for me. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to play the Beatles any more". Charles and Layton asked for listeners' views on Lennon's comment and the response was overwhelmingly negative. Charles later stated, [...] "We just felt it was so absurd and sacrilegious that something {{ought to be done}} to show them that they can't get away with this sort of thing". Al Benn, who was the bureau manager for United Press International News, heard the WAQY show and immediately filed a news report in New York City, culminating in a major news story in The New York Times on 5 August. Over twenty other stations followed WAQY's lead with similar announcements. Some stations in the Deep South went further, organising demonstrations with bonfires, drawing hordes of teenagers to publicly burn their Beatles records and other memorabilia.|$|E
