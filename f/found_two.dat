5|$|As her {{research}} progressed, Carson found a sizable community of scientists who were documenting the physiological and {{environmental effects of}} pesticides. She also took advantage of her personal connections with many government scientists, who supplied her with confidential information. From reading the scientific literature and interviewing scientists, Carson <b>found</b> <b>two</b> scientific camps {{when it came to}} pesticides: those who dismissed the possible danger of pesticide spraying barring conclusive proof, and those who were open to the possibility of harm and willing to consider alternative methods such as biological pest control.|$|E
5|$|Author Michael Bradley {{and friend}} Deanna Theilmann-Beann searched for Mussie in the Nepenthe, a boat with sonar technology. With their sonar, they <b>found</b> <b>two</b> creatures they {{hypothesized}} could be two marine mammals, three metres long. Bradley concluded {{that at least}} one creature compatible with Mussie's description lived in the lake, though he did not investigate the creatures further. Scientists have also surveyed the area and found nothing, though the definitive nonexistence of a Mussie-like creature is difficult to establish because some of the trenches in Muskrat Lake extend to over 60 metres.|$|E

5|$|CT {{screening}} {{is associated}} with a high rate of falsely positive tests which may result in unneeded treatment. For each true positive scan there are about 19 falsely positives scans.

5|$|Dayton {{was founded}} on April 1, 1796, by 12 {{settlers}} known as the Thompson Party. They traveled in March from Cincinnati up the Great Miami River by pirogue and landed at what is now St. Clair Street, where they <b>found</b> <b>two</b> small camps of Native Americans. Among the Thompson Party was Benjamin Van Cleve, whose memoirs provide insights into the Ohio Valley's history. Two other groups traveling overland arrived several days later.|$|E

5|$|Neither the Jewish {{religious}} leaders in Poland nor the authorities allowed archaeological excavations {{at the camp}} {{out of respect for}} the dead.

5|$|A 2016 phylogenetic {{analysis}} {{conducted by}} Sachs et al. <b>found</b> <b>two</b> equally strong alternative placements of Brancasaurus (including Gronausaurus): within the Leptocleididae; {{or as the}} sister taxon of a clade containing both Leptocleididae and Polycotylidae, with the clade containing all of the aforementioned taxa being the sister taxon of Elasmosauridae. The study concluded that, currently, no phylogenetic dataset is sufficient to resolve the relationships of Brancasaurus. In addition {{to the fact that}} the type specimen is a subadult, this inconsistency in results can be attributed to the mix of leptocleidid, polycotylid, and elasmosaurid characteristics that is seen in Brancasaurus. The cladograms below illustrate the alternate arrangements.|$|E
5|$|According to chapter 9 of the Prose Edda book Gylfaginning, {{the three}} {{brothers}} Vili, Vé, and Odin, are {{the creators of}} the first man and woman. The brothers were once walking along a beach and <b>found</b> <b>two</b> trees there. They took the wood and from it created the first human beings; Ask and Embla. One of the three gave them the breath of life, the second gave them movement and intelligence, and the third gave them shape, speech, hearing and sight. Further, the three gods gave them clothing and names. Ask and Embla go {{on to become the}} progenitors of all humanity and were given a home within the walls of Midgard.|$|E

On the 20th, Nepaulin, another British {{auxiliary}} minesweeper was lost {{on one of}} UB-12s mines near the Dyck Lightvessel. Six days later, the British steamer Alhama was mined while loaded with pit props destined for Dunkirk. The 1,744-ton cargo ship was the largest ship sunk by UB-12 since the Silksworth Hall, sunk the previous April. UB-12 sank another two ships under Steindorff's command, one each in June and July. The steamer Dulwich—carrying coal from Seaham for London—was mined and sunk {{with the loss of}} five men on 10 June. One month later, the French patrol vessel Jupiter I was mined off Calais. These were the last two ships credited to mines from UB-12 for the next fourteen months.|$|E

5|$|During the American Civil Rights Movement in the 1960s, Meridian {{was home}} to a Council of Federated Organizations (COFO) office and several other activist organizations. James Chaney and other local residents, along with Michael Schwerner, his wife Rita, and Andrew Goodman, volunteers from New York City, worked to create a {{community}} center. They held classes during Freedom Summer to help prepare African Americans {{in the area to}} prepare to regain their constitutional franchise, after having been excluded from politics since disenfranchisement in 1890. Whites in the area resented the activism, and physically attacked civil rights workers. In June 1964, Chaney, Schwerner, and Goodman went to Neshoba County, Mississippi, to meet with members of a black church that had been bombed and burned. The three disappeared that night on their way back to Meridian. Following a massive FBI investigation, their murdered bodies were <b>found</b> <b>two</b> months later, buried in an earthen dam.|$|E
5|$|First {{discovered}} in March 1973, the tablets were initially {{thought to be}} wood shavings until one of the excavators <b>found</b> <b>two</b> stuck together and peeled them apart to discover writing on the inside. They {{were taken to the}} epigraphist Richard Wright, but rapid oxygenation of the wood meant that they were black and unreadable {{by the time he was}} able to view them. They were sent to Alison Rutherford at Newcastle University Medical School for multi-spectrum photography, which led to infra-red photographs showing the scripts for researchers for the first time. The results were initially disappointing as the scripts were undecipherable. However, Alan Bowman at Manchester University and David Thomas at Durham University analysed the previously unknown form of cursive script and were able to produce transcriptions.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, Frederick V. Coville called {{attention}} to the threatened state of the plant in an article in Science. While investigating the species for horticultural purposes, he only <b>found</b> <b>two</b> herbarium specimens, those of Baird and Canby. (Coville apparently did not locate Kinn's West Virginia specimen, preserved at the Muhlenberg Herbarium.) Upon examination of the New Bloomfield site in 1918, he discovered the entire colony, except for one patch cut off by cultivation, was connected by roots, and that no seedlings were in evidence anywhere around the margins of the colony. Coville concluded that the plant was self-sterile and reproduced by extending rootstocks. After commercial nurserymen removed a truckload of box huckleberry from the New Bloomfield site in 1918, Coville was particularly anxious to preserve the species, as the New Bloomfield site was the only one then thought extant. (It was protected by the state from 1929, becoming the Hoverter and Sholl Box Huckleberry Natural Area.) However, Edgar T. Wherry was able to locate the Delaware colony, thought lost, in 1919, and send specimens for cross-pollination with specimens from the Pennsylvania colony.|$|E
