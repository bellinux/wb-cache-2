25|$|Metronidazole (MNZ), marketed {{under the}} brand name Flagyl among others, is an {{antibiotic}} and antiprotozoal medication. It is used either alone or with other antibiotics to treat pelvic inflammatory disease, endocarditis, and bacterial vaginosis. It is effective for dracunculiasis, <b>giardiasis,</b> trichomoniasis, and amebiasis. It is the drug of choice for a first episode of mild-to-moderate Clostridium difficile colitis. Metronidazole is available by mouth, as a cream, and intravenously.|$|E
25|$|Metronidazole is {{primarily}} used to treat: bacterial vaginosis, {{pelvic inflammatory disease}} (along with other antibacterials like ceftriaxone), pseudomembranous colitis, aspiration pneumonia, rosacea (topical), fungating wounds (topical), intra-abdominal infections, lung abscess, periodontitis, amoebiasis, oral infections, <b>giardiasis,</b> trichomoniasis, and infections caused by susceptible anaerobic organisms such as Bacteroides, Fusobacterium, Clostridium, Peptostreptococcus, and Prevotella species. It is also often used to eradicate Helicobacter pylori along with other drugs and to prevent infection in people recovering from surgery.|$|E
2500|$|Giardia lamblia, {{also known}} as Giardia intestinalis, [...] is a flagellated {{parasite}} that colonizes and reproduces in the small intestine, causing <b>giardiasis.</b> The parasite attaches to the epithelium by a ventral adhesive disc, and reproduces via binary fission. <b>Giardiasis</b> does not spread via the bloodstream, nor does it spread {{to other parts of}} the gastrointestinal tract, but remains confined to the lumen of the small intestine. Giardia trophozoites absorb their nutrients from the lumen of the small intestine, and are anaerobes. [...] If the organism is split and stained, its characteristic pattern resembles the familiar [...] "smiley face" [...] symbol. Chief pathways of human infection include ingestion of untreated sewage, a phenomenon particularly common in many developing countries; contamination of natural waters also occurs in watersheds where intensive grazing occurs.|$|E
2500|$|Giardia lamblia {{infection}} {{can occur}} through ingestion of dormant microbial cysts in contaminated water or food, {{or by the}} fecal–oral route (through poor hygiene practices). The cyst can survive for weeks to months in cold water, so can be present in contaminated wells and water systems, especially stagnant water sources, such as naturally occurring ponds, storm water storage systems, and even clean-looking mountain streams. [...] Giardia lamblia is a microscopic parasite that causes the diarrheal illness known as <b>giardiasis.</b> Can also be found on surfaces, soil, food, or water that has been contaminated with feces from infected humans or animals. They may also occur in city reservoirs and persist after water treatment, as the cysts are resistant to conventional water treatment methods, such as chlorination and ozonolysis. Zoonotic transmission is also possible, so Giardia infection is a concern for people camping in the wilderness or swimming in contaminated streams or lakes, especially the artificial lakes formed by beaver dams (hence the popular name for <b>giardiasis,</b> [...] "beaver fever").|$|E
