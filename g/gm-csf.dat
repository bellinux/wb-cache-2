5|$|High-risk {{neuroblastoma}} {{is treated}} with intensive chemotherapy, surgery, radiation therapy, bone marrow / {{hematopoietic stem cell}} transplantation, biological-based therapy with 13-cis-retinoic acid (isotretinoin or Accutane) and antibody therapy usually administered with the cytokines <b>GM-CSF</b> and IL-2.|$|E
5|$|Virotherapy {{involves}} the use of genetically modified viruses to treat diseases. Viruses have been modified by scientists to reproduce in cancer cells and destroy them but not infect healthy cells. Talimogene laherparepvec (T-VEC), for example, is a modified herpes simplex virus that has had a gene, which is required for viruses to replicate in healthy cells, deleted and replaced with a human gene (<b>GM-CSF)</b> that stimulates immunity. When this virus infects cancer cells, it destroys them and in doing so the presence the <b>GM-CSF</b> gene attracts dendritic cells from the surrounding tissues of the body. The dendritic cells process the dead cancer cells and present components of them to other cells of the immune system. Having completed successful clinical trials, this virus is expected to gain approval for the treatment of a skin cancer called melanoma in late 2015. Viruses that have been reprogrammed to kill cancer cells are called oncolytic viruses.|$|E
5|$|With current treatments, {{patients}} with low and intermediate risk disease {{have an excellent}} prognosis with cure rates above 90% for low risk and 70–90% for intermediate risk. In contrast, therapy for high-risk neuroblastoma {{the past two decades}} resulted in cures only about 30% of the time. The addition of antibody therapy has raised survival rates for high-risk disease significantly. In March 2009 an early analysis of a Children's Oncology Group (COG) study with 226 high-risk patients showed that two years after stem cell transplant 66% of the group randomized to receive ch14.18 antibody with <b>GM-CSF</b> and IL-2 were alive and disease-free compared to only 46% in the group that did not receive the antibody. The randomization was stopped so all patients enrolling on the trial will receive the antibody therapy.|$|E
25|$|Dendritic {{cells can}} also be {{activated}} in vivo by making tumour cells express <b>GM-CSF.</b> This {{can be achieved by}} either genetically engineering tumor cells to produce <b>GM-CSF</b> or by infecting tumor cells with an oncolytic virus that expresses <b>GM-CSF.</b>|$|E
25|$|This {{concept was}} applied in topical {{administration}} of pDNA encoding IL-10. Plasmid encoding B7-1 (a ligand on APCs) successfully enhanced the immune response in tumour models. Mixing plasmids encoding <b>GM-CSF</b> and the circumsporozoite protein of P. yoelii (PyCSP) enhanced protection against subsequent challenge (whereas plasmid-encoded PyCSP alone did not). It was proposed that <b>GM-CSF</b> caused dendritic cells to present antigen more efficiently and enhance IL-2 production and TH cell activation, thus driving the increased immune response. This {{can be further}} enhanced by first priming with a pPyCSP and pGM-CSF mixture, followed by boosting with a recombinant poxvirus expressing PyCSP. However, co-injection of plasmids encoding <b>GM-CSF</b> (or IFN-γ, or IL-2) and a fusion protein of P. chabaudi merozoite surface protein 1 (C-terminus)-hepatitis B virus surface protein (PcMSP1-HBs) abolished protection against challenge, compared to protection acquired by delivery of pPcMSP1-HBs alone.|$|E
25|$|In 2005, {{encouraging}} but {{mixed results}} of vaccination were reported with the BCR/abl p210 fusion protein {{in patients with}} stable disease, with <b>GM-CSF</b> as an adjuvant.|$|E
25|$|In general, co-administration of pro-inflammatory agents (such {{as various}} interleukins, tumor {{necrosis}} factor, and <b>GM-CSF)</b> plus TH2-inducing cytokines increase antibody responses, whereas pro-inflammatory agents and TH1-inducing cytokines decrease humoral responses and increase cytotoxic responses (more important in viral protection). Co-stimulatory molecules such as B7-1, B7-2 and CD40L are sometimes used.|$|E
25|$|Rhabdoid cells often express protein {{products}} suggestive of aggressive, dedifferentiated cells, including neuroendocrine tumor-related products and granulocyte-macrophage colony stimulating factor (<b>GM-CSF).</b> Vimentin, an intermediate filament protein {{usually associated with}} non-carcinomatous tumors (i.e. sarcoma), is ubiquitous in rhabdoid cells. Co-expression of cytokeratins and vimentin are associated with cells undergoing epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT).|$|E
25|$|CTL {{responses}} can {{be enhanced}} by co-inoculation with co-stimulatory molecules such as B7-1 or B7-2 for DNA vaccines against influenza nucleoprotein, or <b>GM-CSF</b> for DNA vaccines against the murine malaria model P. yoelii. Co-inoculation with plasmids encoding co-stimulatory molecules IL-12 and TCA3 were shown to increase CTL activity against HIV-1 and influenza nucleoprotein antigens.|$|E
25|$|Sipuleucel-T (Provenge) is {{the only}} {{approved}} cancer vaccine. It was approved for treatment of asymptomatic or minimally symptomatic metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer in 2010. The treatment consists of removal of antigen-presenting cells from blood by leukapheresis and growing them with the fusion protein PA2024 made from <b>GM-CSF</b> and prostate-specific prostatic acid phosphatase (PAP) and reinfused. This process is repeated three times.|$|E
25|$|Sargramostim, or granulocyte-monocyte colony {{stimulating}} factor (<b>GM-CSF),</b> {{has been}} shown to substantially improve health-related quality of life in pilot studies, measured by an increase in score on a 32-item IBD questionnaire. A recent Phase II trial showed that Sargramostim significantly decreased CD severity (48%, compared with 26% in the placebo group) and improved quality of life (40%, versus 19% for placebo).|$|E
25|$|One {{method of}} {{inducing}} dendritic cells to present tumor antigens is by vaccination with autologous tumor lysates or short peptides (small parts of protein {{that correspond to}} the protein antigens on cancer cells). These peptides are often given in combination with adjuvants (highly immunogenic substances) to increase the immune and anti-tumor responses. Other adjuvants include proteins or other chemicals that attract and/or activate dendritic cells, such as granulocyte macrophage colony-stimulating factor (<b>GM-CSF).</b>|$|E
25|$|With a {{high rate}} of Ras {{mutation}} in CMML, deregulation of this signalling pathway has been linked to the pathogenesis of the disease. Tumour necrosis factor, <b>GM-CSF,</b> interleukin-3, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 may have a role in hyperproliferative CMML cells. These cytokines can stimulate the growth of CMML in vitro. Hypermethylation of cytosine residues (usually in the promoter regions of genes) occurs in many malignancies to regulate gene expression. One commonly hypermethylated gene in CMML is p15INK4b, a gene involved in cell cycle regulation.|$|E
25|$|Prime-boost {{strategies}} {{have been successful}} in inducing protection against malarial challenge in a number of studies. Primed mice with plasmid DNA encoding Plasmodium yoelii circumsporozoite surface protein (PyCSP), then boosted with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the same protein had significantly higher levels of antibody, CTL activity and IFN-γ, and hence higher levels of protection, than mice immunized and boosted with plasmid DNA alone. This can be further enhanced by priming with a mixture of plasmids encoding PyCSP and murine <b>GM-CSF,</b> before boosting with recombinant vaccinia virus. An effective prime-boost strategy for the simian malarial model P. knowlesi has also been demonstrated. Rhesus monkeys were primed with a multicomponent, multistage DNA vaccine encoding two liver-stage antigens – the circumsporozoite surface protein (PkCSP) and sporozoite surface protein 2 (PkSSP2) – and two blood stage antigens – the apical merozoite surface protein 1 (PkAMA1) and merozoite surface protein 1 (PkMSP1p42). They were then boosted with a recombinant canarypox virus encoding all four antigens (ALVAC-4). Immunized monkeys developed antibodies against sporozoites and infected erythrocytes, and IFN-γ-secreting T-cell responses against peptides from PkCSP. Partial protection against sporozoite challenge was achieved, and mean parasitemia was significantly reduced, compared to control monkeys. These models, while not ideal for extrapolation to P. falciparum in humans, will be important in pre-clinical trials.|$|E
2500|$|While T-Vec {{is using}} the cells's {{translation}} machinery to replicate, it also uses it make the cell create <b>GM-CSF.</b> [...] In theory, the <b>GM-CSF</b> that is secreted or released when the cancer cell bursts, attracts dendritic cells to the site, which pick up the tumor antigens, process them, and then present them on their surface to cytotoxic (killer) T cells which in turn sets of an immune response. Whether <b>GM-CSF</b> produced from T-Vec is actually causing such an immune response in people to whom T-Vec was administered, was not certain as of 2016.|$|E
2500|$|Immune Modulation: Blastocystis {{has been}} shown to provoke cells from the human colon to produce {{inflammatory}} cytokines Interleukin-8 and <b>GM-CSF.</b> [...] Interleukin-8 plays a role in rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E
2500|$|Eosinophil {{recruitment}} into inflammatory {{tissue is}} a complex process, regulated {{by a number of}} inflammatory cytokines. In EG cytokines IL-3, IL-5 and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (<b>GM-CSF)</b> may be behind the recruitement and activation. They have been observed immunohistochemically in diseased intestinal wall.|$|E
2500|$|T-Vec is {{a genetically}} {{engineered}} herpes virus (an oncolytic herpes virus). [...] Two genes were removed – one that shuts down an individual cell's defenses, {{and another that}} helps the virus evade the immune system –, and a gene for human <b>GM-CSF</b> was added. [...] The drug works by replicating in cancer cells, causing them to burst; it was also designed to stimulate an immune response but as of 2016, {{there was no evidence}} of this.|$|E
2500|$|MS {{patients}} are also {{known to be}} CD46 defective, and this leads to Interleukin-10 (IL-10) deficiency, being this involved in the inflammatory reactions. Levels of IL-2, IL-10, and <b>GM-CSF</b> are lower in MS females than normal. IL6 is higher instead. These findings {{do not apply to}} men. This IL-10 interleukin could be related to the mechanism of action of methylprednisolone, together with CCL2. Interleukin IL-12 is also known to be associated with relapses, but this is unlikely {{to be related to the}} response to steroids ...|$|E
2500|$|T-Vec is a {{biopharmaceutical}} drug; {{it is an}} oncolytic {{herpes virus}} that was created by genetically engineering a strain of herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) taken from a person infected with the virus, rather than a laboratory strain. [...] Both copies of the viral gene coding for ICP34.5 were deleted and replaced with the gene coding for human <b>GM-CSF,</b> and the gene coding for ICP47 was removed. [...] In wild herpes virus, ICP47 suppresses the immune response to the virus; it was removed because the drug was designed {{with the intention of}} activating the immune system.|$|E
2500|$|Numerous immune {{regulatory}} functions {{have been}} reported for the IL-17 family of cytokines, presumably due to their induction of many immune signaling molecules. [...] The most notable role of IL-17 is its involvement in inducing and mediating proinflammatory responses. [...] IL-17 is commonly associated with allergic responses. IL-17 induces the production of many other cytokines (such as IL-6, G-CSF, <b>GM-CSF,</b> IL-1β, TGF-β, TNF-α), chemokines (including IL-8, GRO-α, and MCP-1), and prostaglandins (e.g., PGE2) from many [...] cell types (fibroblasts, endothelial cells, epithelial cells, keratinocytes, and macrophages). IL-17 acts with IL-22 (produced by T helper 17 cells) to induce expression of antimicrobial peptide by keratinocytes.|$|E
2500|$|Red {{and white}} blood cell {{production}} is regulated with great precision in healthy humans, {{and the production of}} leukocytes is rapidly increased during infection. The proliferation and self-renewal of these cells depend on growth factors. One of the key players in self-renewal and development of haematopoietic cells is stem cell factor (SCF), which binds to the c-kit receptor on the HSC. [...] Absence of SCF is lethal. There are other important glycoprotein growth factors which regulate the proliferation and maturation, such as interleukins IL-2, IL-3, IL-6, IL-7. Other factors, termed colony-stimulating factors (CSFs), specifically stimulate the production of committed cells. Three CSFs are granulocyte-macrophage CSF (<b>GM-CSF),</b> granulocyte CSF (G-CSF) and macrophage CSF (M-CSF).|$|E
2500|$|Gene {{silencing}} {{may occur}} either via mRNA degradation or preventing mRNA from being translated. For example, miR16 contains a sequence complementary to the AU-rich element {{found in the}} 3'UTR of many unstable mRNAs, such as TNF alpha or <b>GM-CSF.</b> It has been demonstrated that given complete complementarity between the miRNA and target mRNA sequence, Ago2 can cleave the mRNA and lead to direct mRNA degradation. Absent complementarity, silencing is achieved by preventing translation. The relation of miRNA and its target mRNA(s) can {{be based on the}} simple negative regulation of a target mRNA, but it seems that a common scenario is the use of a [...] "coherent feed-forward loop", [...] "mutual negative feedback loop" [...] (also termed double negative loop) and [...] "positive feedback/feed-forward loop" [...] Some miRNAs work as buffers of random gene expression changes arising due to stochastic events in transcription, translation and protein stability. Such regulation is typically achieved by the virtue of negative feedback loops or incoherent feed-forward loop uncoupling protein output from mRNA transcription.|$|E
50|$|<b>GM-CSF</b> {{is found}} in high levels in joints with {{rheumatoid}} arthritis and blocking <b>GM-CSF</b> may reduce the inflammation or damage. Some drugs (e.g. MOR103) are being developed to block <b>GM-CSF.</b>|$|E

5000|$|U937 {{cells are}} of the myeloid lineage and so secrete {{a large number of}} cytokines and chemokines either constitutively (e.g. IL-1 and <b>GM-CSF)</b> or in {{response}} to soluble stimuli. TNFα and recombinant <b>GM-CSF</b> independently promote IL-10 production in U937 cells.|$|E
50|$|Granulocyte-macrophage colony-{{stimulating}} factor (<b>GM-CSF),</b> {{also known}} as colony stimulating factor 2 (CSF2), is a monomeric glycoprotein secreted by macrophages, T cells, mast cells, natural killer cells, endothelial cells and fibroblasts that functions as a cytokine.
