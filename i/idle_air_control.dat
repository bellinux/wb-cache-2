50|$|An <b>idle</b> <b>air</b> <b>control</b> {{actuator}} or <b>idle</b> <b>air</b> <b>control</b> valve (IAC actuator/valve) is {{a device}} {{commonly used in}} fuel-injected vehicles to control the engine's idling RPM. In carburetted vehicles a similar device known as an idle speed control actuator is used.|$|E

60|$|If {{they have}} ever a fanciful and <b>idle</b> <b>air,</b> perhaps the reader will suppose them written {{in the shade of}} a Sunny Day, in the midst of the objects of which they treat, and will like them none the worse for having such {{influences}} of the country upon them.|$|R
50|$|Additional {{functions}} of the ECM include operation of the fuel pump by closing the Ground for the fuel pump relay, and control of idle speed by a throttle plate bypass valve. The <b>Idle</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Control</b> Valve (IACV) (previously known as an Idle Air Stabiliser Valve - IASV), receives a changing milliamp signal that varies the strength of an electromagnet pulling open the bypass valve.|$|E
5000|$|Throttle bodies {{may also}} contain valves and {{adjustments}} {{to control the}} minimum airflow during idle. Even in those units that are not [...] "drive-by-wire", there will often be a small solenoid driven valve, the <b>Idle</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Control</b> Valve (IACV), that the ECU uses to control the amount of air that can bypass the main throttle opening to allow the engine to idle when the throttle is closed.|$|E
50|$|Most engine {{systems have}} {{idle speed control}} built into the ECU. The engine RPM is {{monitored}} by the crankshaft position sensor which plays a primary role in the engine timing functions for fuel injection, spark events, and valve timing. Idle speed is controlled by a programmable throttle stop or an idle air bypass control stepper motor. Early carburetor-based systems used a programmable throttle stop using a bidirectional DC motor. Early Throttle body injection (TBI) systems used an <b>idle</b> <b>air</b> <b>control</b> stepper motor. Effective idle speed control must anticipate the engine load at idle.|$|E
50|$|An ideal idle descent, {{also known}} as a “green descent” uses the minimum fuel, {{minimizes}} pollution (both at high altitude and local to the airport) and minimizes local noise. While most modern FMS of large airliners are capable of <b>idle</b> descents, most <b>air</b> traffic <b>control</b> systems cannot handle multiple aircraft each using its own optimum descent path to the airport, at this time. Thus the use of idle descents is minimized by <b>Air</b> Traffic <b>Control.</b>|$|R

40|$|Several idle control {{actuators}} {{are based}} on a solenod technology but a more efficient solution is to use stepper motors. Ehanced knowledge of the <b>idle</b> <b>air</b> flow parameters allows optimization of the stepper motor design.

5000|$|Air was {{provided}} {{from the air}} filter intake to the intake manifold by a Holley-designed, aluminum, twin-venturi, mechanically actuated throttle body, which was bolted atop the intake manifold. Each venturi was progressively bored and had a diameter of 50mm. To this unit were mounted the Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor and <b>Idle</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Control</b> (IAC) valve (initially {{referred to as the}} [...] "AIS Motor"). A steel cable connected the accelerator pedal inside the vehicle to a mechanical linkage {{at the side of the}} throttle body, which acted to open the air intake butterfly valves inside the venturis. During idle these butterfly valves were closed, so a bypass port and the IAC valve were used to control the intake of air.|$|E
5000|$|... 2008: The CB400SF Hyper VTEC Revo {{introduced}} Honda's PGM-FI programmed {{fuel injection}} and an <b>idle</b> <b>air</b> <b>control</b> valve for improved fuel economy and reliability. Revised engine materials and an integrated crank-case cover reduced the engine weight by 2 kg. The VTEC operation was further refined such that in gears 1-5 four-valve operation engaged at 6,300 rpm for wide open throttle, otherwise at 6,750 rpm, and remaining at 6,750 rpm in 6th gear. Independent cylinder ignition timing map, revised air intake geometry {{and a larger}} stainless steel muffler contribute to fuel efficiency. Updated frame rigidity and engine mounting position improved handling. Optional combined ABS uses three-piston sliding calipers on the front brakes instead of the standard four-piston opposed calipers and a larger 256 mm rear brake disc. Overall weight increased by 4 kg, and 9 kg with ABS.|$|E
5000|$|The SBEC {{controlled}} the ignition, {{as well as}} the opening and closing of the fuel injectors. During cold startup, wide-open throttle and deceleration, it did this based on [...] "open-loop", pre-programmed operating parameters. During normal idle and cruising, it began [...] "closed-loop" [...] operation, during which the module acted based upon inputs from a variety of sensors. The basic sensors that provided input to the SBEC included the Oxygen sensor (O2), Manifold Absolute Pressure (MAP) sensor, Throttle Position Sensor (TPS), Intake Air Temperature (IAT) sensor and Coolant Temperature sensor (CTS). The basic actuators controlled by the SBEC's outputs included the fuel injectors, ignition coil and pickup, and the <b>Idle</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Control</b> (IAC) valve. The latter controlled idle characteristics. However, the SBEC also {{controlled the}} operation of the charging system, air conditioning system, cruise control and, in some vehicles, transmission shifting. By centralizing control of these systems, the operation of the vehicle was simplified and streamlined.|$|E

40|$|Copyright © 2007 SAE International Due to the {{nonlinear}} time-varying {{nature of}} the spark-ignition engine, an adaptive multi-input single-output (MISO) controller based on self-tuning regulator (STR) is proposed for idle speed control in this paper. The spark timing and <b>idle</b> <b>air</b> <b>control</b> are simultaneously employed as control inputs for maintaining the desired idle speed, and are designed based on P and PI type STR, respectively. The Recursive Least Square technique is employed to identify the engine as a first-order MISO linear model. Pole placement technique is then used to design the adaptive MISO controller. Performances of the proposed algorithm are evaluated using a nonlinear engine model in Matlab/Simulink. The system parameters with 10 % uncertainties are also utilized to perform the associated robustness analysis. Preliminary simulation results show significant reduction of speed deviations under the presence of torque disturbances and model uncertainties...|$|E
