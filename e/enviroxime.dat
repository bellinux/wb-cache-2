The marked hydrophobicity and water insolubility of this compound may be a factor for this disparity. To overcome this handicap, we incorporated <b>enviroxime</b> into liposomes and then tested the antirhinovirus activity and toxicity of the liposome-incorporated <b>enviroxime</b> (LE) in cell culture and studied its administration by small-particle aerosol. Free <b>enviroxime</b> and LE were found to have equivalent efficacies against rhinovirus strains 1 A and 13 in in vitro assays; however, preparations of LE were 10 - to {{greater than or equal to}} 50 -fold less toxic to tissue culture cells than was free <b>enviroxime.</b> In contrast to free <b>enviroxime,</b> which could not be delivered by small-particle aerosol because of its water insolubility, LE (4 mg/ml) was readily and successfully delivered by small-particle aerosol to the upper and lower respiratory tracts of mice; after just 20 min, significant levels of <b>enviroxime</b> were detected in the lungs and noses of exposed mice.

40|$|<b>Enviroxime</b> is an {{antiviral}} {{compound that}} inhibits the replication of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. We have explored {{the mechanism of}} action of <b>enviroxime</b> by using poliovirus type 1 and human rhinovirus type 14 as model systems. By varying the time of drug addition to virus-infected cells, we determined that <b>enviroxime</b> could be added several hours postinfection without significant loss of inhibition. This suggested that the drug targeted a step involved in RNA replication or protein processing. To identify this target, we mapped 23 independent mutations in mutants that could multiply {{in the presence of}} 1 microgram of <b>enviroxime</b> per ml. Each of these mutants contained a single nucleotide substitution that altered one amino acid in the 3 A coding region. Using oligonucleotide-directed mutagenesis of cDNA clones, we have confirmed that these single-amino-acid substitutions are sufficient to confer the resistance phenotype. In addition, we conducted two experiments to support the hypothesis that <b>enviroxime</b> inhibits a 3 A function. First, we determined by dot blot analysis of RNA from poliovirus-infected cells that <b>enviroxime</b> preferentially inhibits synthesis of the viral plus strand. Second, we demonstrated that <b>enviroxime</b> inhibits the initiation of plus-strand RNA synthesis as measured by the addition of [32 P]uridine to 3 AB in poliovirus crude replication complexes. To our knowledge, this is the first evidence that 3 A can be targeted by antiviral drugs. We anticipate that <b>enviroxime</b> will be a useful tool for investigating the natural function of the 3 A protein...|$|E

40|$|<b>Enviroxime</b> [2 -amino- 1 -(isopropylsulfonyl) - 6 -benzimidazole phenyl ketone oxime] is since {{long known}} as an {{inhibitor}} of the in vitro replication of rhinoviruses and enteroviruses. Picornaviruses resistant to <b>enviroxime</b> carry mutations in protein 3 A. It was recently shown that <b>enviroxime</b> inhibits RNA replication of picornaviruses by inhibiting phosphatidylinositol 4 -kinase IIIβ (PI 4 KIIIβ). PI 4 KIIIβ regulates the synthesis of enteroviral RNA by creating a micro-environment of phosphatidyl- 4 phosphate (PI 4 P) lipids at the viral replication complexes. Moreover, PI 4 KIIIα was identified as an important host factor for HCV replication. Knockdown of PI 4 KIIIα expression drastically changed the membranous web morphology. We here report that <b>enviroxime</b> selectively inhibits HCV genotype 1 a and 1 b subgenomic replicon replication. Viral RNA replication is inhibited in a dose-dependent manner with an EC 50 value of 0, 26 ± 0, 06 µM (CC 50 = 28 µM). Following 8 weeks of culturing, enviroxime-resistant replicons were generated (EC 50 = 19 µM). Genotyping of the resistant replicon population revealed the presence of two mutations in NS 4 B (V 38 M, D 167 E) and several in NS 5 A. Interestingly, both HCV NS 4 B and picornavirus 3 A are membrane associated proteins {{that are involved in}} the formation of the membranous web. Swapping of NS 5 A of the enviroximeres replicon or introduction of the V 38 M mutation into a wild-type genome did not result in a transfer of the resistant phenotype. Replicon carrying the D 167 E mutation had a pronounced reduction in replication fitness as compared to wild-type and could therefore not be assayed for susceptibility to <b>enviroxime.</b> siRNA knockdown of PI 4 KIIIα in the enviroximeres replicon containing cells is currently being performed to confirm the correlation between the anti-HCV activity of <b>enviroxime</b> and inhibition of PI 4 KIIIα. Furthermore, PI 4 P stainings will provide more information on the inhibition of PI 4 P synthesis upon <b>enviroxime</b> treatment. In summary, we here report on the in vitro anti-HCV activity of <b>enviroxime.</b> Genotyping of the enviroximeres replicon revealed the presence of mutations in NS 4 B and in NS 5 A. The observation that HCV replicons can adopt a strategy to replicate (largely) independently from an essential host factor is intriguing. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|A novel compound, TTP- 8307, was {{identified}} as a potent inhibitor of the replication of several rhino- and enteroviruses. TTP- 8307 inhibits viral RNA synthesis in a dose-dependent manner, without affecting polyprotein synthesis and/or processing. Drug-resistant variants of coxsackievirus B 3 were all shown to carry at least one amino acid mutation in the nonstructural protein 3 A. In particular, three mutations located in a non-structured region preceding the hydrophobic domain (V 45 A, I 54 F, and H 57 Y) appeared to contribute to the drug-resistant phenotype. This region has previously been identified as a hot sport for mutations that resulted in resistance to <b>enviroxime,</b> the sole 3 A-targeting enterovirus inhibitor reported thus far. This was corroborated by the fact that TTP- 8307 and <b>enviroxime</b> proved cross-resistant.

40|$|Several groups {{reported}} that PI 4 KIIIα {{is an important}} host factor for HCV replication. PI 4 KIIIα creates a micro-environment of phosphatidyl- 4 phosphate (PI 4 P) lipids at the viral replication complexes. Knockdown of PI 4 KIIIα expression drastically changed the membranous web morphology and disturbed viral RNA replication (Reiss et al, 2011). Furthermore, PI 4 KIIIα seems {{to be involved in}} NS 5 A phosphorylation. Similarly, PI 4 KIIIβ activity is required for replication of picornaviruses. Inhibition of PI 4 KIIIβ by <b>enviroxime</b> and enviroxime-like compounds was shown to inhibit picornavirus replication (Arita et al, 2011). Interestingly, we recently demonstrated that <b>enviroxime</b> also inhibits HCV replication in vitro. We here report the identification of compound A, a novel inhibitor of in vitro HCV genotype 1 a and 1 b subgenomic replicon replication. Compound A was designated as an enviroxime-like inhibitor, since it also inhibits picornaviruses and selects for the same resistance mutations in poliovirus as <b>enviroxime.</b> In enzymatic assays both compound A and <b>enviroxime</b> inhibit PI 4 KIIIβ 10 -fold more potently than PI 4 KIIIα. The protein and mRNA expression of both lipid kinases in replicon containing cells are not affected upon treatment. Interestingly, only siRNA knockdown of PI 4 KIIIα resulted in inhibition of HCV replication, whereas knockdown of PI 4 KIIIβ did not. Short-term treatment changed the PI 4 P pattern/levels in the plasma membrane. To further characterize the mechanism of action of both compounds, compound A-resistant and enviroxime-resistant replicons were generated (fold resistance= 80 and 69). The compound A-resistant and enviroxime-resistant replicons are cross-resistant {{with each other and with}} AL- 9 (PI 4 KIIIα inhibitor) and PIK 93 (PI 4 KIIIα/β inhibitor). The intracellular PI 4 P levels and PI 4 P localization in the resistant replicon cells are similar to wild-type. When RNA of resistant replicon cells is stably transfected in Huh 7 cells in the presence of low concentrations of compound, the susceptibility to <b>enviroxime</b> decreased 10 to 20 -fold, suggesting that (at least) part of the resistant phenotype is conferred by adaptations in the viral genome. Two mutations in NS 4 B (V 38 M, D 167 E) and several in NS 5 A were identified in the resistant replicon population. Swapping of NS 5 A of the resistant replicons or introduction of the V 38 M mutation into a wild-type genome did not result in a transfer of the resistant phenotype. Replicon carrying the D 167 E mutation had a pronounced reduction in replication fitness as compared to wild-type and could therefore not be assayed for susceptibility to <b>enviroxime.</b> Studies to further unravel the mechanism of resistance to compound A and <b>enviroxime</b> are still ongoing. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Link to journal homepage: [URL] {{different}} antiviral assays {{were developed}} for the in vitro screening of inhibitors of the hepatitis A virus (HAV) of which (i) a cytopathic effect reduction assay suitable for medium-to-high-throughput screening and (ii) two virus yield reduction assays (based on quantification of viral RNA) for genotypes IB and IIIA. The assays were validated for antiviral studies with interferon-alpha (IFNα) and amantadine HCl, two known inhibitors of HAV replication. IFNα effectively inhibited HAV replication, whereas the activity of amantadine HCl appeared to be strain-dependent.

To reveal the target molecule of MRL- 1237 in viral replication, we selected spontaneous MRL- 1237 -resistant poliovirus mutants. Of 15 MRL- 1237 -resistant mutants obtained, 14 were cross-resistant to guanidine hydrochloride (mrgr), while 1 was susceptible (mrgs). Sequence analysis of the 2 C region revealed that the 14 mrgr mutants contained a single nucleotide substitution that altered an amino acid residue from Phe- 164 to Tyr. The mrgs mutant, on the other hand, contained a substitution of Ile- 120 to Val. Through {{the construction of a}} cDNA-derived mutant, we confirmed that the single mutation at Phe- 164 was really responsible for the reduced susceptibility to MRL- 1237. MRL- 1237 inhibited poliovirus-specific RNA synthesis in HeLa cells infected with a wild strain but not with an F 164 Y mutant. We furthermore examined the effect of mutations of the 2 C region on the drug sensitivity of cDNA-derived guanidine-resistant and -dependent mutants. Two guanidine-resistant mutants were cross-resistant to MRL- 1237 but remained susceptible to another benzimidazole, <b>enviroxime.</b> Either MRL- 1237 or guanidine stimulated the viral replication of two guanidine-dependent mutants, but <b>enviroxime</b> did not.

Because {{of the increase in}} patients with EV-D 68 and also the potential for neurological disease, an animal model is needed to study the disease and to evaluate experimental therapies for EV-D 68 infection. To develop the animal model, 4 -week old AG 129 mice that lack alpha and beta interferon receptors, making them immunosuppressed, were used. The mice were infected with EV-D 68 by the intranasal route to allow infection of the lungs. On day- 3 post-infection the mice were euthanized and lungs were removed and homogenized for collection of virus. The newly collected virus was then used to infect another set of mice. This procedure was repeated 30 times. As passage number increased so did the amount of virus that was collected from the lungs of mice. The virus titer increased 320 -fold between mouse passage 0 to 30. At the end of the thirtieth passage, multiple tissues (lungs, liver, kidney, spleen, blood, brain, spinal cord and leg muscle) were collected from infected mice over several days and titered to demonstrate how quickly the virus spread to various tissues within the mouse.

40|$|<b>Enviroxime</b> is an antienterovirus {{compound}} that targets viral protein 3 A and/or 3 AB and suppresses {{a step in}} enterovirus replication by unknown mechanism. To date, four antienterovirus compounds, i. e., GW 5074, Flt 3 inhibitor II, TTP- 8307, and AN- 12 -H 5, {{are known to have}} similar mutations in the 3 A protein-encoding region causing resistance to <b>enviroxime</b> (a G 5318 A [3 A-Ala 70 Thr] mutation in poliovirus [PV]) and are considered enviroxime-like compounds. Recently, antienterovirus activity of a phosphatidylinositol 4 -kinase III beta (PI 4 KB) inhibitor, PIK 93, was reported, suggesting that PI 4 KB is an important host factor targetable by antienterovirus compounds (N. Y. Hsu et al., Cell 141 : 799 - 811, 2010). In this study, we analyzed the inhibitory effects of previously identified enviroxime-like compounds (GW 5074 and AN- 12 -H 5) and a newly identified antienterovirus compound, T- 00127 -HEV 1, on phosphoinositide (PI) kinases. We found that T- 00127 -HEV 1 inhibited PI 4 KB activity with a higher specificity for than other PI kinases, in contrast to GW 5074, which had a broad specificity for PI kinases. In contrast, AN- 12 -H 5 showed no inhibitory effect on PI 4 KB activity and only moderate inhibitory effects on PI 3 -kinase activity. Small interfering RNA (siRNA) screening targeting PI kinases identified PI 4 KB is a target of GW 5074 and T- 00127 -HEV 1, but not of AN- 12 -H 5, for anti-PV activity. Interestingly, T- 00127 -HEV 1 and GW 5074 did not inhibit hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, in contrast to a strong inhibitory effect of AN- 12 -H 5. These results suggested that PI 4 KB is an enterovirus-specific host factor required for the replication process and targeted by some enviroxime-like compounds (T- 00127 -HEV 1 and GW 5074) and that enviroxime-like compounds may have targets other than PI kinases for their antiviral effect...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Demyelinating {{strains of}} Theiler's murine {{encephalomyelitis}} virus (TMEV) {{such as the}} DA strain are the causative agents of a persistent infection that induce a multiple sclerosis-like disease in {{the central nervous system}} of susceptible mice. Viral persistence, mainly associated with macrophages, is considered to be an important disease determinant that leads to chronic inflammation, demyelination and autoimmunity. In a previous study, we described the establishment of a persistent DA infection in RAW macrophages, which were therefore named DRAW. Results In the present study we explored the potential of diverse compounds to modulate viral persistence in these DRAW cells. Hemin was found to increase viral yields and to induce cell lysis. <b>Enviroxime</b> and neutralizing anti-TMEV monoclonal antibody were shown to decrease viral yields, whereas interferon-α and interferon-γ completely cleared the persistent infection. We also compared the cytokine pattern secreted by uninfected RAW, DRAW and interferon-cured DRAW macrophages using a cytokine protein array. The chemokine RANTES was markedly upregulated in DRAW cells and restored to a normal expression level after abrogation of the persistent infection with interferon-α or interferon-γ. On the other hand, the chemokine MCP- 1 was upregulated in the interferon-cured DRAW cells. Conclusion We have identified several compounds that modulate viral replication in an in vitro model system for TMEV persistence.

In a recent epidemic in the United States, 1. 153 people were confirmed with respiratory illness caused by EV-D 68, mostly children with asthma or a history of wheezing. The virus also has been associated occasionally with polio-like illness (muscle weakness or paralysis). Moreover, EV-D 68 was detected in specimens from 14 patients who died. EV-D 68 thus emerged as a considerable global health threat, requiring the development of effective antiviral treatment. To assess the activity of antiviral molecules against EV-D 68 a panel of 7 clinical isolates was selected consisting of representative strains of the three major genogroups. The following inhibitors were included in this study: (i) two capsid-binding compounds, pleconaril and pirodavir; (ii) the protease inhibitor rupintrivir; (iii) the host cell-targeting compound enviroxime; and (iv) the broad-spectrum antivirals favipiravir (T- 705) and arbidol. Our preliminary results with the 7 clinical isolates reveal that pleconaril and rupintrivir efficiently inhibited in vitro EV-D 68 replication. Favipiravir (recently approved in Japan to treat influenza virus infections) and <b>enviroxime</b> also resulted in a clear antiviral effect. On the other hand, pirodavir and arbidol resulted only in a modest inhibitory effect on EV-D 68 replication. We will present data on the in vitro anti-EV-D 68 activity of this compound-panel against the wider panel of recent EV-D 68 isolates. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|Human {{rhinovirus}} (HRV) is {{the predominant}} {{cause of the}} common cold, but more importantly infection may have serious repercussions in asthmatics and COPD patients. A cell-based antiviral screen against HRV was performed with a subset of our proprietary compound collection, and an aminothiazole series with pan-HRV species and enteroviral activity was identified. The series was found to act {{at the level of}} replication in the HRV infectious cycle. In vitro selection and sequencing of aminothiazole series-resistant HRV variants revealed a single nucleotide mutation leading to the amino acid change I 42 V in the essential HRV 3 A protein. This same mutation has been previously implicated in resistance to <b>enviroxime,</b> a former clinical-stage anti-picornaviral agent. Enviroxime-like compounds have recently been shown to target the lipid kinase phophatidylinositol 4 -kinase III beta (PI 4 KIIIβ). A good correlation between PI 4 KIIIβ activity and HRV antiviral potency was found when analyzing the data over 80 compounds of the aminothiazole series, covering a 750 -fold potency range. The mechanism of action through PI 4 KIIIβ inhibition was further demonstrated by siRNA knockdown of PI 4 KB, which reduced HRV replication and also increased the potency of the PI 4 KIIIβ inhibitors. Inhibitors from two different structural classes with promising pharmacokinetic profiles and with very good selectivity for PI 4 KIIIβ were used to dissociate compound-related toxicity from target-related toxicity. Mortality was seen in all dosing groups of mice treated with either compound, therefore suggesting that short term inhibition of PI 4 KIIIβ is deleterious. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|RNA viruses can rapidly mutate {{and acquire}} {{resistance}} to drugs that directly target viral enzymes, which poses serious {{problems in a}} clinical context. Therefore, {{there is a growing}} interest in the development of antiviral drugs that target host factors critical for viral replication, since they are unlikely to mutate in response to therapy. We recently demonstrated that phosphatidylinositol- 4 -kinase IIIbeta (PI 4 KIIIbeta) and its product phosphatidylinositol- 4 -phosphate (PI 4 P) are essential for replication of enteroviruses, a group of medically important RNA viruses including poliovirus (PV), coxsackievirus, rhinovirus, and enterovirus 71. Here, we show that <b>enviroxime</b> and GW 5074 decreased PI 4 P levels at the Golgi complex by directly inhibiting PI 4 KIIIbeta. Coxsackievirus mutants resistant to these inhibitors harbor single point mutations in the non-structural protein 3 A. These 3 A mutations did not confer compound-resistance by restoring the activity of PI 4 KIIIbeta {{in the presence of the}} compounds. Instead, replication of the mutant viruses no longer depended on PI 4 KIIIbeta, since their replication was insensitive to siRNA-mediated depletion of PI 4 KIIIbeta. The mutant viruses also did not rely on other isoforms of PI 4 K. Consistently, no high level of PI 4 P could be detected at the replication sites induced by the mutant viruses in the presence of the compounds. Collectively, these findings indicate that through specific single point mutations in 3 A, CVB 3 can bypass an essential host factor and lipid for its propagation, which is a new example of RNA viruses acquiring resistance against antiviral compounds, even when they directly target host factors...|$|E
40|$|Hepatitis A and E virus are {{the most}} prominent¨ causes of acute viral {{hepatitis}} worldwide (chapter ¨ 1). Despite the availability of an effective vacc ine for hepatitis A virus (HAV), it is widespread¨ in developing countries and outbreaks still occur¨ regularly in industrialized regions. Although most ¨infections are asymptomatic, or have a mild clini cal course, severe cases of hepatitis A may occur, ¨especially in the elderly. The availability of po tent and selective inhibitors of HAV replication w ould be highly appreciated for treating these seve re cases, to reduce the duration of illness and to ¨contain outbreaks. To allow for identi fication and development of such inhibitors of HAV ¨replication, three antiviral assays were develope d, including a cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction a ssay and two virus yield reduction assays for geno types IB and IIIA (chapter 2). The assays were val idated with two known inhibitors of HAV replicatio n: interferon alpha (IFNα) effectively inhib ited virus replication, while the activity of aman tadine HCl proved to be strain-dependent. In addit ion, {{the effect of the}} enterovirus inhibitors plec onaril, rupintrivir and <b>enviroxime</b> on HAV replicat ion was assessed. Pleconaril exhibited some very m oderate activity, whereas the effect of rupintrivi r proved to be strain-dependent. <b>Enviroxime</b> did no t inhibit HAVreplication, suggesting that phosphat idylinositol- 4 -kinase IIIβ (PI 4 KIIIβ) is¨not crucial in the HAV life cycle. Sim ilar to HAV, hepatitis E virus (HEV) is transmitte d feco-orally. Consequently, large outbreaks are o ften reported in refugee camps, e. g. in Africa. In fections are often asymptomatic or mild, although¨ severe infections may occur, especially in pregnan t women. Chronic cases of hepatitis E have also be en described in immunocompromised patients (such a s transplant recipients) with a high risk for cirr hosis and liver failure. HEV infections can be tre ated with an extended ribavirin (RBV) regimen whic h seems mostlyeffective, although cases of treatme nt failure have been reported and side effects may ¨be severe. Consequently, {{there is a need for}} more¨potentnon-toxic inhibitors of HEV replication and ¨for characterization of thecurrently used RBV tre atment regimen. First, an antiviral ass ay was developed using the HEV-related cutthroat t rout virus (CTV) as a surrogate virus (chapter 3). ¨RBV and trout IFN were found to efficiently inhib it CTV replication, while other known broad-spectr um inhibitorsof RNA virus replication such as the¨ nucleoside analog 2 ’-C-methylcytidine result ed only in a moderate antiviral activity. In addit ion, CTV is only detected in trout during spawning, which suggests a hormonal influence on viral rep lication and is reminiscent of the high susceptibi lity of pregnant women to severe hepatitis E. Cons equently, the effect of three sex steroids on in vitro CTV replication was evaluated. Where as progesterone resulted in marked inhibition of v irus replication, testosterone and 17 β-estrad iol stimulated viral growth. Our data thusindicate ¨that CTV may serve as a surrogate model for HEV. Next, the in vitro culturable¨ HEV strain Kernow-C 1 p 6 and a derived subgenomic r eplicon were used to develop antiviral assays for¨ the genuine HEV (chapter 4). Thus it was confirmed ¨that IFNα and RBV inhibit in vitro ¨HEV replication. A moderate but significant syner gism was observed for combinations of both drugs. ¨ These findings corroborate the reported clinical e ffectiveness. In addition, the invitro me chanism of action of RBV was studied and was found¨to dependon depletion of intracellular GTP pools. Since cases of RBV treatment failure h ave been described, a collaboration was initiated¨ with the clinical reference laboratory for hepatit is E in Hannover, Germany (chapter 5). We analyzed ¨blood samples collected from 15 patients with chr onic hepatitis E who were recipients of solid-orga n transplants andwere treated with RBV. All patien ts cleared the virus except for two non-responders ¨of which one patient died. A G 1634 R mutation in t he viral polymerase was detected in the HEV RNA of ¨the non-responders; this mutation did not provide ¨the virus with resistance to RBV in vitro. However, the mutant form of a subgenomic replico n of genotype 3 HEV replicated more efficiently in vitro than HEV without this mutation, an d the same was true for infectious virus, includin g in competition assays. Similar results were obta ined for genotype 1 HEV. The G 1634 R mutation there fore appears to increase the replicative capacity¨ of HEV inthe human liver and hence reduce the effi cacy of RBV. In a recent paper by Zhou¨ and colleagues, a stimulating effect of mammalian¨ targetof rapamycin (mTOR) -inhibitors such as rapam ycin and everolimus on HEV replication was describ ed. In chapter 6, we discuss these observatio ns, including clinical implications and possible u nderlying mechanisms, in an Editorial.

40|$|An {{estimated}} 170 {{million people}} are chronically infected with the hepatitis C virus (HCV) worldwide and thus at increased risk of developing liver cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma. Moreover, late complications of HCV infection {{are the most important}} indication for liver transplantation in Western countries. The current standard therapy consists of the combination of pegylated interferon-alfa and ribavirin. The efficacy of standard therapy is however limited, particularly in genotype 1 infected patients, and therapy is associated with serious adverse effects. Therefore, more potent and better tolerated drugs are urgently needed to treat HCV infected patients. The last decade great {{progress has been made in}} the development of direct acting antivirals (DAA) against HCV. Very recently, the first DAA received market authorisation by the FDA, being protease inhibitors telaprevir (Incivek®) and boceprevir (Victrelis®). A major challenge for future HCV therapy will be the prevention of drug resistance development. Due to the poor fidelity of the HCV polymerase and the high magnitude of replication, drug resistant variants pre-exist as minor populations within the patients population of HCV quasispecies. As shown by in vitro and in vivo studies, these resistant variants will rapidly become dominant in the virus population when treated with one DAA. For several classes of HCV inhibitors, the development of drug resistance has been studied in vitro. However, since different resistance selection protocols are used in different studies, it is not possible to directly compare the genetic barrier to antiviral drug resistance of various (classes of) HCV drugs. In the first part of this thesis (chapter 2) we therefore present a comparative study of the genetic barrier to resistance of different classes of HCV inhibitors. We demonstrated that the choice of the resistance selection protocol can influence the emergence of resistance mutations. Furthermore, we confirmed that nucleoside polymerase inhibitors and host-targeting antivirals (DEB 025) have a high genetic barrier to resistance as compared to protease inhibitors and non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitors (NNI). A mutation that is known to be involved in resistance to a benzofuran NNI, C 445 F (in NS 5 B), may compensate for the loss of replication fitness caused by unfit drug resistance mutations for other classes of NNIs. Our observations highlight the importance of in depth studies on the in vitro drug resistant genotype and phenotype of inhibitors when planning (combination) clinical studies. In the slipstream of the resistance studies that were performed for a number of HCV reference inhibitors, we identified a novel resistance mutation selected for by the non-nucleoside polymerase inhibitor benzimidazole JT- 16, T 389 S/A. The characterization of this mutation is described in chapter 3. The signature resistance mutations for benzimidazole and indole derivatives are located at residues P 495, P 496 and V 499 in thumb domain 1 of HCV NS 5 B. We here demonstrated that T 389 A and T 389 S resulted in moderate levels of resistance to JT- 16. On the contrary, P 495 A resulted in higher levels of resistance. Although associated with a lower resistance level, mutation T 389 S was found to be the dominant resistance mutation in the JT- 16 res population. This is probably due to the good replicative capacity of this mutant, whereas the replication fitness of P 495 A proved to be markedly impaired when compared to wild-type. We thereby demonstrated that the resistance mutations emerging during resistance selection can be affected by structural modifications within a class of inhibitors with a similar scaffold. To address the major challenge of HCV therapy regarding resistance development, it will be necessary to combine antivirals that have a different mode of action or that target different positions on the same protein. In chapter 4, we determined the antiviral efficacy of various combinations of NNIs and the barrier towards resistance development of such combinations. Three NNIs with a different allosteric binding site were studied: benzimidazole JT- 16 (thumb domain 1), thiophene carboxylic acid (thumb domain 2) and benzofuran HCV- 796 (palm domain 2). The emergence of double resistant variants was efficiently prevented by short-term treatment with double combinations of either HCV- 796, JT- 16 or TCA whereas NNI monotherapy resulted readily in the emergence of resistant mutants. However, when a long-term, stepwise resistance selection protocol was used, double and triple NNI resistant replicons could be generated. The triple NNI resistant replicon proved resistant to all four classes of NNIs because of the partial overlap between the palm 1 and palm 2 binding pocket on NS 5 B. Furthermore, we demonstrated that combination therapy of NNIs did not significantly complicate the resistance profiles that are observed with monotherapy. Interestingly, different signature mutations emerged for some NNI depending on the other NNI in the particular combination. With these results we demonstrated that the design of a combination therapy solely based on the use of NNIs that target different allosteric pockets should be in theory possible. Another strategy to delay or prevent the development of HCV resistance to antivirals could be the use of host-targeting antivirals (HTA) in HCV therapy. A particular characteristic of HCV is the intimate link with the lipid metabolism of the host cell. Therefore, targeting enzymes of the host lipid metabolism could be a new approach for the inhibition of HCV replication. Statins, the cholesterol-lowering drugs, have been reported to inhibit HCV replication in vitro. In chapter 5, we characterized the in vitro anti-HCV activity of statins alone and in combination with HCV DAA or interferon-alfa. When combined with HCV DAA or interferon-alfa, statins resulted in an additive antiviral activity. Furthermore, statin-containing combinations exhibited a great potential to clear hepatoma cells from their HCV replicon. We also demonstrated that statins are able to delay or prevent the development of resistance towards DAAs. Our data therefore encourage the potential use of statins in combination with the standard therapy or HCV DAA. The mechanism by which statins inhibit HCV replication has not yet been elucidated. Since statins were found to inhibit viral RNA replication in subgenomic replicons that only encode for the non-structural HCV proteins, the intracellular replication machinery is expected to be the target. In chapter 6, we aimed to light a tip of the veil on the mechanism of the anti-HCV activity of statins. Recent studies suggest that the in vitro anti-HCV activity of statins is due to the inhibition of geranylgeranylation of cellular proteins. We demonstrated that exogenously added geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGpp) reversed the anti-HCV activity of statins, whereas cholesterol was unable to resort this effect. Furthermore, statins altered the localization of Rab 5, a geranylgeranylated host protein which is a necessary host factor for HCV replication. This effect was reversed by exogenous GGpp but not by exogenous cholesterol. Since the intracellular localization of Rab 5 is essential for its correct function, we hypothesize that statin treatment hampers the function of Rab 5 in the cell and that this altered Rab 5 function probably disturbs efficient HCV replication. Of course, further study will be needed to provide more insights in the role of prenylated Rab 5 in the replication of HCV. Other host-targeting approaches could be considered in anti-HCV therapy. A good host target may be phosphatidylinositol 4 -kinase IIIalfa (PI 4 KIIIalfa), which was reported across several studies to be essential for HCV replication. Interestingly, <b>enviroxime</b> and enviroxime-like inhibitors were shown to inhibit RNA replication of picornaviruses by inhibiting a similar lipid kinase, PI 4 KIIIß. We therefore characterized in chapter 7 the in vitro anti-HCV activity of <b>enviroxime</b> and a newly identified enviroxime-like inhibitor, compound A. To this end, we generated enviroxime-resistant and compound A-resistant replicons. <b>Enviroxime</b> and compound A proved cross-resistant, suggesting a similar mechanism responsible for resistance. Furthermore, we demonstrated that the resistant phenotype is associated with the viral genome by transfecting the RNA from resistant replicon cultures into naïve hepatoma cells. Genotyping of the resistant replicon populations revealed that the resistant replicons shared two mutations in NS 4 B (V 38 M, D 167 E) and one in NS 5 A (D 389 N). Swapping of the NS 5 A gene of the compound Ares replicon into a wild-type genome did not result in a transfer of the resistant phenotype. Therefore, mutations in NS 5 A are probably not responsible for resistance. The key mutation(s) responsible for the resistant phenotype thus remain to be identified. Altogether, we demonstrated that a new class of HCV HTA, the enviroxime-like compounds, can inhibit the in vitro replication of HCV. The main target of this class of inhibitors remains to be identified, but our data combined with previously published results provide strong evidence that PI 4 KIIIalfa is involved. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|The genus Enterovirus of {{the family}} Picornaviridae {{includes}} many important human pathogens, such as poliovirus (PV), coxsackievirus, enterovirus 71 and rhinovirus. These viruses can cause {{a wide variety of}} diseases, ranging from mild to potentially fatal. Efficient vaccines against PV have almost succeeded to globally eradicate PV, but development of vaccines against all enteroviruses is not feasible due to the enormous amount of serotypes (almost 300 identified to date). At the moment, no antiviral drugs are available and treatment is limited to symptomatic and supportive care. For these reasons, antiviral drugs are urgently needed. In addition, antiviral drugs may be beneficial to contain any posteradication outbreaks of PV which may occur after stopping of the global vaccination program. Therefore, the aim of this thesis was to identify and characterize targets in the replication cycle of enteroviruses for antiviral therapy and compounds with antiviral activity against enteroviruses. These compounds may either exert their antiviral activity by targeting viral proteins or host factors that are essential for virus replication. Furthermore, by studying the mechanism of action of enterovirus inhibitors, we aim to increase our knowledge of the viral replication process and the requirements. This information may in turn benefit the search for new antiviral drugs, for example by identifying new drug targets. In CHAPTER 2, we have studied the effects of two putative inhibitors of the cellular protein GBF 1 on enterovirus replication. The guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF 1 is an essential host factor for replication of enteroviruses. At the early secretory pathway, GBF 1 activates the GTPase Arf 1 by stimulating GTP exchange. Activated Arf 1 then regulates membrane trafficking through the recruitment of effector proteins. Inhibition of GBF 1 by the fungal metabolite Brefeldin A (BFA) strongly impairs enterovirus replication. The compound Golgicide A (GCA) was proposed to be an inhibitor of GBF 1, with a similar mechanism of action as BFA, but with higher specificity. AG 1478 was also reported to inhibit GBF 1 activity, but in a different, probably indirect manner. Consequently, we investigated whether these compounds would share the antiviral effect of BFA. We found that GCA inhibited enterovirus replication, but {{this was not the case}} for AG 1478, supporting the idea that this latter compound does not inhibit GBF 1 in the same manner as the other compounds. A further major finding supporting this idea is that the effects of AG 1478 on the function and integrity of the secretory pathway could be rescued by overexpression of Arf 1, which was not the case for BFA and GCA. Both GCA, which unlike BFA does not target other large Arf activators, and AG 1478, which disrupts secretory pathway integrity and function by a different mechanism than BFA and GCA, provide important new tools to further dissect the role of GBF 1 in enterovirus RNA replication. CHAPTER 3 describes the identification and characterization of a newantiviral compound, TTP- 8307. The spectrum of antiviral activity of TTP- 8307 encompassed most, but not all, enteroviruses. To study the mechanism of action of the compound, TTP- 8307 -resistant coxsackievirus B 3 (CVB 3) mutants were selected by passaging 10 times in the presence of TTP- 8307. These mutants harbored mutations in the viral protein 3 A, a membrane protein implicated in the viral modification of secretory pathway membranes. Previously, a variety of mutations in 3 A had been shown to confer resistance to <b>enviroxime,</b> an antiviral compound identified in the late 1970 s of which the mechanism of action remained unknown. We showed that the TTP- 8307 -resistant mutants were cross-resistant to <b>enviroxime,</b> suggesting that these antiviral compounds have a similar or related mechanism of action. Subsequently, in CHAPTER 4 we showed that GW 5074 also is an inhibitor of enterovirus replication, and that this kinase inhibitor, as well as <b>enviroxime,</b> act by inhibiting the activity of PI 4 KIIIß, a lipid kinase that had just been identified as an essential host factor for enterovirus replication 3. We also showed that enviroxime- and GW 5074 -resistant viruses (i. e., the viruses with the single point mutations identified in CHAPTER 3) could replicate in the absence of high levels of PI 4 P, the product of PI 4 KIIIß. These results demonstrate that viruses are so versatile that they can even bypass the need for host factors for virus replication. In CHAPTER 5, NIH Clinical Collection compound library, a collection of small molecules that have a history of use in human clinical trials, was screened for inhibitors of CVB 3. This screen revealed that itraconazole (ITZ), a compound which is in use as an antifungal drug, has antiviral activity. Known targets of ITZ, such as hCYP 51, CYP 3 A 4 or the hedgehog pathway were investigated if they mediated the antiviral activity of ITZ, but this appeared not to be the case. Interestingly, the antiviral activity of ITZ could be counteracted by the same mutations in 3 A that provided protection against PI 4 KIIIß inhibitors, suggesting a similar mechanism of action. However, ITZ had no effect on PI 4 KIIIß activity. Also, unlike PI 4 KIIIß inhibitors, ITZ inhibited virus replication of cardioviruses, providing further evidence for a different target. CHAPTER 6 reports on the antiviral activity of fluoxetine, an anti-depressant (brand name Prozac) that was also identified in a screen of the NIH Clinical Collection. The antiviral spectrum of activity of fluoxetine encompassed some enteroviruses, but not all. The observation that mutations in the viral protein 2 C of CVB 3 offered protection to the compound, suggested that fluoxetine targets 2 C. 2 C has been implicated in many different aspects of virus replication, but its exact function is unknown. 2 C is an ATPase, but fluoxetine had only a modest effect on 2 Cs ATPase activity. This finding suggests that fluoxetine targets another activity of 2 C. In CHAPTER 7, we studied the antiviral activity of the small molecule GPC-N 114. GPC-N 114 inhibited virus replication of both enteroviruses and cardioviruses at the RNA replication stage. No resistant CVB 3 variants were obtained despite many passages in the presence of GPC-N 114. In the cardiovirus EMCV, mutations in the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase 3 Dpol conferred resistance to the compound. Accordingly, GPC-N 114 inhibited in vitro elongation activity of CVB 3 and EMCV 3 Dpol. Analysis of the three-dimensional structure of 3 Dpol in complex with GPC-N 114 revealed that the compound, a non-nucleoside analog, bound at the site where the templating nucleotide is located during the RNA replication process. This result suggests that GPC-N 114 may interfere with template binding. This hypothesis was confirmed in functional studies. Collectively, these findings show that GPC-N 114 inhibits picornavirus replication by affecting the binding of the RNA template to 3 Dpol, making this the first picornavirus inhibitor with this mechanism of action. Finally, in CHAPTER 8 we describe the development of a cell-based assay for determining the capability of compounds to inhibit picornaviral protease activity. Inhibition of protease activity results in the induction of expression of a firefly luciferase reporter. A major advantage of this assay is that it is cell-based, in contrast to most protease assays available, allowing to select for non-toxic and cell-permeable compounds. We showed that the assay could accurately predict the potential of compounds to inhibit virus replication, with IC 50 values obtained for several compounds in the same range as those determined with virus infections. In addition, the assay was versatile, applicable to CVB 3 3 Cpro and 2 Apro and could easily be extended to 3 Cpro of different genera. In combination with the excellent properties for use in a high-throughput setting, this assay could be a valuable tool for the discovery and validation of protease inhibitors.
