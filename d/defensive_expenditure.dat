40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{concept of}} {{stewardship}} in environmental economics is an established tool for environmental {{and natural resource}} management and the mitigation of risk from climate change. Similar concepts are well-established in accounting and management. Despite the ubiquity {{of the concept of}} stewardship, there is no generally accepted definition. We define the information steward as the agent/institution who enhances the system’s resilience and sustainability, by maintaining and extending the life of its nominal operational capacity. Unlike individual agents who are not able to value systemic losses, the steward, whose function is the viability of the system as a whole, values such damages that degrade the system at a higher rate by adopting a lower discount rate. In the presence of deliberate attacks that degrade the information used/kept in the system, individual agents ’ <b>defensive</b> <b>expenditure</b> is always lower that the expenditure undertaken under instructions from the information steward. The ability of the steward to mobilize the totality of agents reduces the number of attackers, increasing the systems sustainability under a variety of technological considerations. The resulting configuration of <b>defensive</b> <b>expenditure,</b> although higher than the level that individual agents would have chosen based on their own valuation of their expected losses, ensures that the overall probability of successful attacks falls, significantl...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{explores the}} role of Environmental <b>Defensive</b> <b>Expenditures</b> in the {{consumption}} behaviour of Italian households. Environmental <b>Defensive</b> <b>Expenditures</b> are not borne to increase households' welfare, but to prevent or avoid {{the effects of a}} worsening environmental quality. The literature on environmental accounting argues that economic growth in industrialized countries is accompanied by an increasing load of defensive activities that may lead to a reorientation of consumption behaviour. In this work this hypothesis is tested using annual data on mean consumption expenditures of Italian households from 1985 to 1996. A complete system of demand is estimated and short-run price elasticities of demand for <b>Defensive</b> <b>Expenditures</b> are calculated. The complete system of demand functions is specified using the Quadratic Almost Ideal Demand System proposed by Banks, Blundell and Lewbel. Results show that there is very low substitution between the demand for the six aggregate goods in which total expenditure is here divided and the Environmental <b>Defensive</b> <b>Expenditures.</b> Thus it seems that an increase in Environmental <b>Defensive</b> <b>Expenditures,</b> driven by a change in environmental quality, would not lead to a change in the consumption pattern, {{at least as far as}} Italian households are concerned. ...|$|R

The model {{is based on}} the interactions among visitors V, quality of ecosystem goods E, and capital K, intended as accommodation and entertainment facilities, in Protected Areas (PAs). The tourism user fees (TUFs) are used partly as a <b>defensive</b> <b>expenditure</b> and partly to increase the capital stock. The stability and existence of Hopf bifurcation are investigated. It is that stability switches and Hopf bifurcation occurs when the delay t passes through a sequence of critical values, tau 0. It has been that the introduction of a delay is a destabilizing process, in the sense that increasing the delay could cause the bio-economics to fluctuate. Formulas about the stability of bifurcating periodic solution and the direction of Hopf bifurcation are exhibited by applying the normal form theory and the center manifold theorem. Numerical simulations are given to illustrate the results. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{suggests}} that the GPP of Nakhon Ratchasima should be adjusted by environmental related expenditure in order to seek for the potential GPP representing genuine final output or final consumption. The environmental adjusted GPP (eaGPP) would show the real potential of the Province in producing goods and services after maintaining environmental quality and natural resources.

The environmental related expenditure due to water pollution in 2006 is the summation of impact costs of water pollution (7. 87 million baht) and wastewater abatement costs (42. 7 million baht), which {{gives rise to the}} expense of 50. 57 millions baht.

40|$|Pesticide {{spraying}} {{by farmers}} has an adverse {{impact on their}} health. However, in studies to date examining farmers’ exposure to pesticides, the costs of ill health and their determinants {{have been based on}} information provided by farmers themselves. Some doubt has therefore been cast on the reliability of these estimates. In this study, we address this by conducting surveys among two groups of farmers who use pesticides on a regular basis. The first group is made up of farmers who perceive that their ill health is due to exposure to pesticides and have obtained at least some form of treatment (described in this article as the ‘general farmer group’). The second group is composed of farmers whose ill health has been diagnosed by doctors and who have been treated in hospital for exposure to pesticides (described here as the ‘hospitalised farmer group’). Cost comparisons are made between the two groups of farmers. Regression analysis of the determinants of health costs show that the most important determinants of medical costs for both samples are the <b>defensive</b> <b>expenditure,</b> the quantity of pesticides used per acre per month, frequency of pesticide use and number of pesticides used per hour per day.

40|$|Nowadays {{people spend}} {{increasingly}} more {{to protect against}} deterioration of the environment they live in. Environmental degradation, in fact, induces agents to replace consumption of “free ” environmental public goods (e. g. meadows, unpolluted water, silence) with that of expensive private goods that may satisfy the same needs. This phenomenon {{is becoming more and}} more frequent in many industrialized countries. Consumption of mineral water, for instance, has increased in cities where tub water is non-drinkable. Similarly, many Northern countries have experienced an increasing consumption of double windows to protect against traffic noise.

40|$|In {{order to}} gauge the {{sustainability}} of the economic growth of nations, genuine savings rates are used as a ready comparable measure. Essentially it provides {{a measure of the}} sum of the change in various forms of capital, including manufactured, ecological (natural resource and pollution), human and knowledge capital. The depreciation in manufactured and natural capital during the economic growth process is deducted from the conventional national savings to measure genuine wealth. With increasing attention to global warming, the loss due to the increase in stock pollution of carbon emissions has also entered into the accounting exercise. However the damage from local flow and stock pollutants to human capital productivity has not got the same attention. This paper argues that in a developing country like India, where adverse human health impacts are known to be significant from local pollution and <b>defensive</b> <b>expenditure</b> is not forthcoming from the population at large, ignoring human productivity losses introduces a serious upward bias in the genuine wealth and savings measure especially with an increasing trend in emission of hazardous wastes. To this effect, it considers human capital as a function of both education and the stock pollutant in the Hamilton model that further raises the cost of pollutants. The paper suggests that, the depreciation in human capital may be taken as an increasing function of the local pollution generated in the system (following the current logic of using education expenditure as a proxy for enhancement in human capital). The attention to the local pollutants in the genuine wealth and savings measure would help focus developing country government policy on local pollution concurrently with their focus on global pollutants. The paper observes that current development of green accounting system in India {{is a step in the}} right direction, since it has attempted to account for health costs of pollution in some of the states. ...|$|E
40|$|Rand Water {{contracted}} UNISA {{to develop}} a monetary valuation method for its open spaces and their inherent ecological functions. This study began by reviewing existing contemporary definitions of open space in South Africa and then identifying their key characteristics. The research project then looked at the economic contribution that open spaces make to {{the economy as a}} basis for environmental valuation. By determining the economic value of open spaces, decision makers can be informed about the importance of open space provision, preservation and maintenance. The project applied the participatory action research method which requires the active participation of focus groups. The focus groups consisted of Rand Water employees who deal with open spaces in their respective areas of work. During the literature review and problem formulation the various limitations of environmental valuation methods became evident. It became apparent that the development of new valuation methods would not be possible before existing valuation methods had been tested {{to see if they could}} feasibly be applied to open space in the Rand Water context. A literature review also determined that open space valuation studies in South Africa are very limited, which made it difficult to formulate a localised context. It was furthermore found that environmental valuers prefer to use the contingent valuation, travel cost and hedonic pricing methods. These methods rely on revealed and stated preferences of open space users to infer an economic value for an open space. Access to Rand Water’s open spaces is largely limited owing to strict access control. The excludability of open space users therefore hampers the generation of sufficient data to apply revealed and stated preference valuation methods. On the basis of this finding, it was decided to eliminate the contingent valuation and travel cost methods from this study. It was decided to apply the constraint composition theory, under the grounded theory model, to study the constraints or moderators which could affect the feasibility of environmental valuation application to Rand Water open spaces. Four moderators were then identified which could influence the outcome of the feasibility assessment. These are the limitations of the methods, the limitations of the legal framework, the limitations of the user and the limitations of the study area. It was found that the limitations of the methods were a moderator owing to their inherent data requirements. The only suitable valuation methods vi were found to be market based as they were not influenced by the excludability factor. These methods include the replacement cost, damage cost avoided, restoration cost and <b>defensive</b> <b>expenditure</b> valuation methods. The focus group was introduced to each method by participating in a method application exercise. Questionnaires regarding each method were completed to test variables. The legal framework was found not to be a moderator since even though there are limited direct provisions in legislation to mandate environmental valuation, there are legal principles which require economic impacts to be measured and damage to the environment to be estimated. These principles in themselves have supported litigation cases and the mere admission of environmental value estimates in court as evidence and support to a case therefore sets the required legal precedence and mandates further application. The user was found not to be a moderator. Feedback from the focus groups as well as an environmental resource economics workshop held at the Gauteng Department of Agriculture, Conservation and Environment showed that users understood environmental valuation principles, their benefits and limitations. With training, environmental scientists can apply these methods. The study area was found to be a moderator. The limited access for potential open space users, limited harvesting, limited agriculture and limited open space categories result in limited values that can be measured. In conclusion, it was found that not all environmental valuation methods can be applied to Rand Water open space owing to inherent limitations of the methods and the study area. Only market-based methods were found to be suitable for use on Rand Water open space. Notwithstanding the limitations of the methods and study area, which restrict the ability of valuers to obtain a total economic value for Rand Water open space, the available suite of methods can provide an indicator of value for environmental goods and services that flow from the utility’s open spaces. It was concluded that the application of environmental valuation methods to Rand Water open space is feasible within the context of the identified limitations. Environmental SciencesM. Sc.

40|$|This work {{examines}} {{the impact that}} economic growth can have on biodiversity and on the ecological dynamics that would naturally emerge {{in the absence of}} human activity. The loss of biodiversity may induce policy-makers to implement defensive actions that prevent single species from extinction. These defensive actions, however, may deeply alter the natural dynamics of interaction between species, leading to an ecological equilibrium that is completely different from the one that would exist in the absence of human intervention. This suggests that there might exist a conflict between preserving biodiversity (through stabilization of the ecological system) and preserving the intrinsic features of the ecological dynamics. To investigate this issue more deeply, we analyze the impact that different objective functions and defensive technologies can have on the natural ecological dynamics, and show that human action can modify the stability of the ecological fixed points.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze an economy in which self–protection choices made by {{economic}} agents to face environmental degradation generate environmental negative externalities on other agents. By self–protection choices we mean choices that agents may {{do to protect}} themselves against some form of social degradation (e. g. crimes, lack of leisure, depletion of social capital) or environmental degradation (air and water pollution, loss of biodiversity, growing scarcity of green areas, etc.). The notion of self–protection choices is not new in the literature. Hirsch (1976) {{was the first to}} introduce the concept of defensive consumption, that is, consumption induced by a growth in negative externalities. The notion originally proposed by Hirsch concerned a wider set of choices than those induced by environmental deterioration. The concept, however, has become particularly popular in the environmental literature where there is a major debate on how the Gross National Product as a measure of welfare should be corrected to take into account <b>defensive</b> <b>expenditures</b> and environmental depletion. 1 There exist many alternative classifications of environmental <b>defensive</b> <b>expenditures</b> generated by self-protection choices (e. g. Hueting, 1980; Leipert, 1989; Leipert and Simonis, 1989). Among them, a particularly interesting taxonomy is the one proposed by Bird (1987) and Shogren and Crocker (1991) who distinguish between environmental self–protection choices that generate negative externalities and those that produce positive externalities. The former choices transfer the environmental damage to other agents, while the latter filter it, transferring the reduction of the environmental damage to other agents. In what follows we will focus on the former category since it appears to be the larger one (cf. Shogren and Crocker, 1991) ...|$|R

In developing countries, electric and water utilities commonly use increasing block tariff (IBT) as a tool to encourage resource conservation, recover costs, and subsidize low-income consumers. However, {{it is not clear whether}} consumers actually respond to marginal prices under IBT. We empirically analyze whether marginal price in an IBT influences residential electricity demand, by combining administrative monthly electricity bill records with a detailed survey of sample households. Results from a bunching analysis and Arellano-Bond estimator show that prices of electricity do not significantly affect monthly electricity consumption. The finding highlights that consumers do not respond to marginal prices under IBT if electricity price is low or if they are unaware of the pricing schedules and have difficulty in understanding how their bills are computed in such tariff structures. This, in turn, has severe implications for the efficacy of the policy objectives of IBT. JEL Classification: C 23, D 12, L 11, L 94, Q 21 Keywords: Residential electricity demand, shared connections, increasing block tariff, bunching analysis, panel data Billing Knowledge and Consumption Behavior: Experimental Evidence from Nonlinear Electricity Tariffs Increasing block tariff for electricity services is a popular tariff structure in developing countries with the ambition to promote resource conservation among users with high consumption and to provide subsidy for low-income consumers. However, in a complex pricing structure, such as increasing block tariff (IBT), consumers may not know the marginal price they face and might not fully understand how their bill is computed. Thus, in this study, we investigate whether educating consumers about how their monthly electricity bill is calculated in an IBT structure affects electricity consumption. To evaluate the effect of the treatment, we conduct a field experiment with residential electricity consumers in Ethiopia where electricity price is heavily subsidized and shared connections are common. Using monthly consumption data from the electric meters, we find no statistically significant effect after six months in response to the treatment. Our finding suggests that it is not the lack of billing information that makes residential electricity consumers insensitive to the IBT. Alternative reasons, such as the low electricity price are provided.

40|$|We {{present a}} simple growth model which has two {{original}} features: the strategic context considered, {{which is an}} evolutionary game, and the growth mechanism described, in which growth is caused by negative externalities. The emphasis in this growth mechanism is evidently different from that placed on positive externalities by current endogenous growth models. In this model welfare depends on three goods: leisure, a free environmental renewable resource, and a non-storable output. The environmental resource is subject to negative externalities, that is, it is deteriorated by {{the production of the}} output. Faced with a forced reduction of the resource, agents may react by increasing the labor supply in order to produce and consume substitutes for the diminishing resource, i. e. they can raise their <b>defensive</b> <b>expenditures.</b> The increase in production and consumption that follows, i. e. growth, generates a further deterioration of the environmental resource, thus giving rise to a self-feeding growth process. The conditions under which multiple equlibria and Pareto-worsening growth dynamics arise, are analysed. Beside showing the logical possibility that negative externalities are the engine of growth, we suggest that the case analysed may be of practical relevance, i. e., that negativ...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{reviews the}} main inadequacies of the Italian current System of National Accounting for the {{forestry}} sector. In recent years research and applications {{have been developed}} in Italy to overcome some of these inadequacies. The paper presents two case studies of environmental accounting of forestry resources at regional/national level: {{the first one is}} an economic estimate {{of the role of the}} forestry sector in the Liguria Region (north-west Italy). The proposed satellite system of forest resources account is based on a Geographical Information System (GIS) comprising an extremely diversified set of physical data, associated with economic information collected through the use of various evaluation methods (Travel Cost Method, Contingent Valuation, reconstruction costs, opportunity costs, etc.). Production of wood and non-wood forest products, soil erosion control, landscape protection, carbon fixing, provision of outdoor recreational areas are taken into account in the proposed System of Regional Accounting for the forestry sector. The second case study consists of a tentative estimate of damage costs from forest fires occurring in Italy over the past eleven years. Official statistical data related to financial costs deriving from forest fires are compared with the results of a tentative estimate of some social costs. Results from the two case studies could be used to evaluate the real contribution of forest activities to national economy and to better orientate public funding and <b>defensive</b> <b>expenditures</b> in the forestry sector...|$|R
40|$|We {{may soon}} face biophysical limits to {{perpetual}} growth. Energy supplies may tighten and then begin a long slow descent while <b>defensive</b> <b>expenditures</b> rise to address {{problems caused by}} past resource consumption. The outcome may be significant changes in daily routines at the individual and community level. It {{is difficult to know}} when this scenario might begin to unfold but it clearly would constitute a new behavioral context, one that the behavioral sciences least attends to. Even if one posits a less dramatic scenario, people may still need to make many urgent and perhaps unsettling transitions. And while a robust response would be needed, {{it is not at all}} clear what should be the details of that response. Since it is likely that no single response will fix things everywhere, for all people or for all time it would be useful to conduct many social experiments. Indeed, a culture of small experiments should be fostered which, at the individual and small group level, can be described as behavioral entrepreneurship. This may have begun, hidden in plain sight, but more social experiments are needed. To be of help, it may be useful to both package behavioral insights in a way that is practitioner-oriented and grounded in biophysical trends and to propose a few key questions that need attention. This paper begins the process of developing a biophysical psychology, incomplete as it is at this early stage...|$|R
40|$|There {{are many}} {{expenditure}} {{options available to}} farmers who received a tobacco buyout check. A multinomial probit model is used to analyze how farmer, business, and household characteristics influence the choice of expenditure option. Results of the study show that farmers tend to use the tobacco buyout payments as a special income account which they spend in a focused manner, and their expenditure choices vary by gender and by age groups. Findings also reveal that farmers who plan to stay in tobacco production {{are more likely to}} invest in new or existing on-farm activities. <b>defensive</b> avoidance, <b>expenditure</b> choices, mental accounting, multinomial probit, tobacco buyout, Agribusiness, Crop Production/Industries, Financial Economics,...|$|R
