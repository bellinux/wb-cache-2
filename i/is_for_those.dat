5|$|The Saguna meditation, that is {{qualified}} and with attributes, <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> {{who need a}} concrete symbol such as a Murti, or a visualization aid. They should think of the identity of their lotus heart having eight petals with the highest self visualized as Vasudeva, Narayana or Purushottama. The meditation should concentrate on one's own identity with this image of imperishable highest self. This is {{the path to the}} state of Vaishvanara, or qualified Dhyana.|$|E
5|$|The Cardigan Welsh Corgi {{was listed}} in the Kennel Club's first list of Vulnerable Native Breeds in 2006. This list <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> breeds which {{register}} less than 300 dogs in any one year; there had been 84 Cardigan Corgis registered in 2006. After an initial increase, this declined to 46 in 2010, but then rose to the highest numbers since the list began in 2015, {{with a total of}} 124 puppies registered. In 2013, the Pembroke Welsh Corgi was also added, as there had been only 241 puppies registered that year. While the Kennel Club blamed this on the importation of foreign dog breeds, The Daily Telegraph blamed the decline on the ban on tail docking introduced six years before. However, 2015 saw an increase of 34% in the number of Pembroke registrations; the popularity of Corgis on Instagram was credited for the change. Pembrokes were removed from the Vulnerable Native Breeds list in 2016.|$|E

25|$|Salvation is {{available}} through Jesus' work on the cross and is a gift from God made possible by grace through faith and not by human works. The PCG believes {{it is possible to}} lose one's salvation if one turns away from God. After salvation, a Christian can receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. The evidence of this baptism is speaking in other tongues. It believes in the doctrine of sanctification as a definite and progressive work of grace. It believes heaven and hell are real places. Heaven <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who have received the gift of salvation, and hell <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who have not.|$|E

25|$|Workers {{must pay}} 12.4 percent, {{including}} a 6.2 percent employer contribution, on their wages below the Social Security Wage Base ($110,100 in 2012), but no {{tax on income}} in excess of this amount. Therefore, high earners pay a lower percentage of their total income because of the income caps; because of this, and the fact there is no tax on unearned income, social security taxes are often viewed as being regressive. However, benefits are adjusted to be significantly more progressive, even when accounting for differences in life expectancy. According to the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, {{for people in the}} bottom fifth of the earnings distribution, the ratio of benefits to taxes is almost three times as high as it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> in the top fifth.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the late}} 1990s, housing {{policy has been}} a devolved matter, and state support for the homeless, {{together}} with legal rights in housing, have therefore diverged to a certain degree. A national service, called Streetlink, was established in 2012 to help {{members of the public}} obtain near-immediate assistance for specific rough sleepers, {{with the support of the}} Government (as housing is a devolved matter, the service currently only extends to England). Currently, the service does not operate on a statutory basis, and the involvement of local authorities is merely due to political pressure from the government and charities, with funding being provided by the government (and others) on an ad-hoc basis. A member of the public who is concerned that someone is sleeping on the streets can report the individual's details via the Street Link website or by calling the referral line number on 0300 500 0914. Someone who finds themselves sleeping on the streets can also report their situation using the same methods. It is important to note that the Streetlink service <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> who are genuinely sleeping on the streets, and not those who may merely be begging, or ostensibly living their life on the streets despite a place to sleep elsewhere (such as a hostel or supported accommodation).|$|E

500|$|... timentibus eum (His mercy <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> {{who fear}} Him from {{generation}} to generation) begins in great contrast softly with undulating movement in 12/8 time, played by the violins. It is a duet of alto and tenor, beginning in parallels of sixths and staying in homophony {{for most of the}} movement. The theme resembles the sarabande of Bach's first French Suite in D minor, BWV 812. Hogwood compares the music to the pastoral sinfonia beginning Part II of Bach's Christmas Oratorio, [...] "creating a romantic, soft-edged, almost comforting sound". Jones remarks that [...] " [...] (who fear him) is [...] "full of pathos and built over a partly chromatic, quasi-ostinato bass", while the [...] "divine quality of mercy is expressed in beatific parallel thirds of the violins in the ritornello".|$|E

2500|$|Where a {{fiduciary}} {{has made}} unauthorised profits, the remedy <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>those</b> profits {{to be held}} on constructive trust. If that profit is no longer available, the fiduciary is [...] "liable to account" [...] to the beneficiaries. In Sinclair Investment Holdings SA v Versailles Trade Finance (No. 3), Rimer J explained that this meant the beneficiaries acquire rights over those profits, and the trustee must pay that money or the money's worth back to the beneficiaries. If the profits are mixed with other money or used to purchase property, the beneficiary may trace that property and claim it. Further expansion of the principle was later given in FHR European Ventures LLP v Cedar Capital Partners LLC.|$|E
