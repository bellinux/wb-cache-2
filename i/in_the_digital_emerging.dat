30|$|A last strand {{connected}} to the academics’ professional learning and identity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> era <b>emerged</b> <b>in</b> tight connection with the educational technologies’ research, by about 2010. <b>The</b> interest <b>in</b> <b>the</b> matter of <b>digital</b> scholarship spread in this research area since scholars contributing to it were interested <b>in</b> <b>the</b> complexities of the technological uptake by institutions and the users as socio-cultural shift encompassing professional practices, the connected learning ecologies and the impacts on professional identity (Pearce et al., 2010). Within this field the research was focused on scholars’ struggle to do (practices) and to be (identity) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> changing context of higher education. In fact, scholars’ were somehow pushed (in rather conflictive and contradictory ways) to keep the pace of innovations based on digital, open and networked contexts (Goodfellow, 2014; Scanlon, 2014; Weller, 2011). The conundrum of opening up science and education was thereby faced through the exploration of professional learning as process through which <b>the</b> scholar undergoes <b>in</b> her effort to be more open, more digital or more networked (Goodfellow, 2014). Moreover, the focus of research shifted from the objective usage of cyberinfrastructures {{to understand how the}} technological affordances might create new scenarios for practice encompassing a deontological reflection (Costa, 2014; Scanlon, 2014; Veletsianos & Kimmons, 2012 b).

Currently, e-learning pedagogies at universities and colleges appear to be fuelled largely by learning management systems (LMS’s) that replicate these traditional paradigms in an online setting. They conform to a “student-as-information consumer ” model, thereby reinforcing instructor-centred approaches to teaching, learning and knowledge, as opposed to being conducive to constructivist modes of learning that enable a high degree of learner self-direction and personalisation. This paper also explores a range of examples demonstrating productive pedagogical applications of social software tools.

A total of 391 respondents, from four research areas (humanities, life sciences, physical sciences, and social sciences) completed the questionnaire. The finding indicated that motivations for citing were complex and multi-faceted, but in all four disciplines, researchers cite a work because they regard it as an authoritative and trustworthy source, which provides a context or building block to their own research. Although researchers have moved from a print-based system to a digital one, it has not significantly changed the way they decide what to trust. Peer reviewed journals are still the most influential. Open access journals will be cited if they have been peer reviewed. Citing on the basis of high altmetrics and other social judgements, such as mentions, likes, and use, was not prevalent.

To date, the discourse on this important subject has been practice-oriented, and lacks a sound integrative framework and theoretical foundation. This grave lacuna <b>in</b> <b>the</b> current discourse on learning in general, and on learning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>digital</b> culture <b>in</b> particular, calls for a clear and theoretically-grounded view of the basic literacies required for effective learning in digital environments. Accordingly, this paper reviews an integrative framework for digital literacy recently suggested by Eshet-Alkalai (2004; 2005) {{as a starting point}} for the much-needed theorization. Two basic strategies – the conservative and the skeptical – are considered for this purpose. The first strategy relies on the basic assumption of the current discourse that "digital skills " are indeed nothing but skills. The second strategy, based on doubts concerning this assumption, leads to two different skeptical hypotheses. The first contends that the skill-oriented discourse can be reduced to the older discourses on learning styles and multiple intelligences; the second attempts to reduce it to the much more fundamental discourse on the clash between the modern book-based and <b>the</b> post modern <b>digital</b> cultures...|$|R
