5|$|HB1002 {{was lost}} on 11July1979 during the aircraft's 52nd flight. A <b>hydraulic</b> leak caused an engine fire, {{resulting}} {{in the loss of}} <b>hydraulic</b> pressure, which in turn caused severe pitch oscillations. The pilot ejected safely, and the aircraft was destroyed. It was later discovered that an engine exhaust clamp had loosened, allowing the hot exhaust to migrate to the right engine compartment. The heat built up there, causing the <b>hydraulic</b> lines to fail. The debris from both aircraft was secretly buried somewhere within the Nellis complex. Despite the crashes, Have Blue was considered a success.|$|E
5|$|It {{is still}} {{possible}} to lose all three <b>hydraulic</b> systems if serious damage occurs elsewhere, as nearly happened to a cargo airliner in 2002 during takeoff when a main gear tire exploded in the wheel well area. The damage in the left wing area caused total fluid loss from the number 1 and the number 2 <b>hydraulic</b> systems. The number 3 system was dented but not penetrated. DC-10s still have no fuse protection {{for any of the}} three <b>hydraulic</b> systems {{in the event of an}} exploding main gear tire.|$|E
5|$|Newer {{aircraft}} designs {{such as the}} McDonnell Douglas MD-11 {{have incorporated}} <b>hydraulic</b> fuses to isolate a punctured section and prevent a total loss of <b>hydraulic</b> fluid. Following the UAL 232 accident, such fuses were installed in the number 3 <b>hydraulic</b> system in the area below the number 2 engine on all DC-10 aircraft to ensure sufficient control capability remained if all three <b>hydraulic</b> system lines should be damaged in the tail area. Although elevator and rudder control would be lost, the aircrew would {{still be able to}} control the aircraft's pitch (up and down) with stabilizer trim, and would be able to control roll (left and right) with some of the aircraft's ailerons and spoilers. Although not an ideal situation, the system provides a greater measure of control than was available to the crew of United 232.|$|E
5|$|Several old {{building}}s, which {{date from}} the 1880s, remain at Underfall Yard and have listed building status. The octagonal brick and terracotta chimney of the <b>hydraulic</b> engine house dates from 1888, and is grade II* listed, as is the <b>hydraulic</b> engine house itself. It is built of red brick with a slate roof and contains pumping machinery, installed in 1907 by Fullerton, Hodgart and Barclay of Paisley, which powers the dock's <b>hydraulic</b> system of cranes, bridges and locks. The former pattern-maker's shop and stores {{date from the}} same period and are grade II listed, as are the Patent slip and quay walls.|$|E
5|$|The NTSB {{determined}} {{that the loss of}} one engine and the asymmetrical drag caused by damage to the wing's leading edge should not have been enough to cause the pilots to lose control of their aircraft; the aircraft should have been capable of returning to the airport using its remaining two engines. The NTSB thus examined the effects that the engine's separation would have on the aircraft's flight control, <b>hydraulic,</b> electrical, and instrumentation systems. Unlike other aircraft designs, the DC-10 did not include a separate mechanism to lock the extended leading edge slats in place, relying instead solely on the <b>hydraulic</b> pressure within the system. The NTSB {{determined that}} the engine tore through multiple <b>hydraulic</b> lines as it separated from the DC-10's wing, causing a loss of <b>hydraulic</b> pressure; airflow over the wings forced the left wing slats to retract, which caused a stall over the left wing. In response to the accident, slat relief valves were mandated to prevent slat retraction in case of <b>hydraulic</b> line damage.|$|E
5|$|The main <b>hydraulic</b> system {{provided}} {{pressure for}} undercarriage raising and lowering and bogie trim; nosewheel centring and steering; wheelbrakes (fitted with Maxarets); bomb doors opening and closing; and (B.2 only) AAPP air scoop lowering. <b>Hydraulic</b> pressure {{was provided by}} three <b>hydraulic</b> pumps fitted to Nos. 1, 2 and 3 engines. An electrically operated <b>hydraulic</b> power pack (EHPP) {{could be used to}} operate the bomb doors and recharge the brake accumulators. A compressed air (later nitrogen) system was provided for emergency undercarriage lowering.|$|E
5|$|The tall <b>hydraulic</b> hoists {{have since}} been demolished.|$|E
5|$|While both gun turrets were rotated by steam power, the new forward {{guns were}} loaded by <b>hydraulic</b> power, unlike the {{original}} guns which were hand worked. Thunderer {{was the first}} ship to have <b>hydraulic</b> loading gear. From 1874, the forward turret alone was converted to <b>hydraulic</b> power operation for training (turret traverse), elevation and ramming. This allowed the turret crew to be reduced from 48 to 28; the aft turret remaining hand-worked as a comparison. Power operation was considered successful, although it was later implicated in the 1879 explosion.|$|E
5|$|F-84C: Reverted to {{the more}} {{reliable}} J35-A-13 engine, improved fuel, <b>hydraulic</b> and electrical systems; 191 built.|$|E
5|$|George P. Mitchell, {{pioneer of}} <b>hydraulic</b> {{fracturing}} technology and developer of The Woodlands, Texas, {{was born and}} raised in Galveston.|$|E
5|$|In 1978 the Swiss {{magazine}} L'Illustré printed {{an aerial}} {{photograph of a}} street in Basel, taken by a pigeon of Febo de Vries-Baumann equipped with a camera with a <b>hydraulic</b> mechanism.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a Lockheed L-1011, {{operating}} as Eastern Airlines Flight 935, suffered a similar failure of its tail-mounted number two engine. The shrapnel from that engine inflicted damage {{on all four}} of its <b>hydraulic</b> systems, which were also close together in the tail structure. Fluid was lost {{in three of the}} four systems. The fourth <b>hydraulic</b> system was impacted with shrapnel, but not punctured. The <b>hydraulic</b> pressure remaining in that fourth system enabled the captain to land the plane safely with some limited use of the outboard spoilers, the inboard ailerons, and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries.|$|E

5|$|Neutron {{bombardment}} of tellurium {{is the most}} common way to produce iodine-131. This in turn is used to treat some thyroid conditions, and as a tracer compound in <b>hydraulic</b> fracturing, among other applications.|$|E
5|$|Sewerage. Sewage {{collection}} {{systems do}} not have sufficient <b>hydraulic</b> capacity to handle wastewater flows, especially in poor neighborhoods, which results in combined sewer overflows and sanitary sewer overflows.|$|E
5|$|The 767 is {{equipped}} with three redundant <b>hydraulic</b> systems for operation of control surfaces, landing gear, and utility actuation systems. Each engine powers a separate <b>hydraulic</b> system, and the third system uses electric pumps. A ram air turbine provides power for basic controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. An early form of fly-by-wire is employed for spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system reduces weight and allows independent operation of individual spoilers.|$|E
5|$|The A-10 is {{exceptionally}} tough, {{being able}} to survive direct hits from armor-piercing and high-explosive projectiles up to 23mm. It has double-redundant <b>hydraulic</b> flight systems, and a mechanical system as a back up if hydraulics are lost. Flight without <b>hydraulic</b> power uses the manual reversion control system; pitch and yaw control engages automatically, roll control is pilot-selected. In manual reversion mode, the A-10 is sufficiently controllable under favorable conditions to return to base, though control forces are greater than normal. The aircraft is designed to fly with one engine, one half of tail, one elevator, and half of a wing missing.|$|E
5|$|The Fishing Creek Sportsmans' Association has {{proposed}} a number of methods to conserve Fishing Creek and its tributaries. These include planting riparian buffers, eliminating leaky septic systems, and protecting the area from <b>hydraulic</b> fracturing.|$|E
5|$|The {{braking system}} is {{conventional}} <b>hydraulic</b> (Power assisted) with disk brakes {{at the front}} and drum brakes at the rear. Anti-lock Braking System and Traction Control System is fitted. The hand/parking brake is cable operated, acting on the rear wheels. The <b>hydraulic</b> fluid reservoir is under the front bonnet/hood. As there is no manifold vacuum, there is an electric vacuum pump located under the rear loading platform. There are interlocks on the braking system so that the starting up process can only be initiated when the brake pedal is pressed.|$|E
5|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> launch motor {{is capable}} of {{producing}} 20,800 peak horsepower (15.5 MW). Because of the high speed and open nature of the trains, the ride will not operate in light rain.|$|E
5|$|Three {{independent}} <b>hydraulic</b> {{systems are}} {{installed on the}} 757, one powered by each engine, and the third using electric pumps. A ram air turbine is fitted to provide power for essential controls {{in the event of}} an emergency. A basic form of fly-by-wire facilitates spoiler operation, utilizing electric signaling instead of traditional control cables. The fly-by-wire system, shared with the 767, reduces weight and provides for the independent operation of individual spoilers. When equipped for extended-range operations, the 757 features a backup <b>hydraulic</b> motor generator and an additional cooling fan in the aircraft's electronics bay.|$|E
5|$|Using <b>hydraulic</b> power, {{the cradle}} was tilted to an angle, so the coal {{ran out of}} the wagon and down a coal chute into the hold of the vessel below.|$|E
5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, the EPA and many companies {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck fuel economy. One such example is the <b>hydraulic</b> hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in <b>hydraulic</b> tanks and <b>hydraulic</b> motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve fuel efficiency by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the power range of the engine.|$|E
5|$|Enhanced {{geothermal}} {{systems can}} trigger earthquakes {{as part of}} <b>hydraulic</b> fracturing. The project in Basel, Switzerland was suspended because more than 10,000 seismic events measuring up to 3.4 on the Richter Scale occurred over the first 6 days of water injection.|$|E
5|$|The Comet had a {{total of}} four <b>hydraulic</b> systems, two primaries, one secondary, and a final {{emergency}} system for basic functions such as lowering the undercarriage. The undercarriage could also be lowered by a combination of gravity and a hand-pump. Power was syphoned from all four engines for the hydraulics, cabin air conditioning, and the de-icing system; these systems had operational redundancy in that they could keep working even if only a single engine was active. The majority of <b>hydraulic</b> components were centred in a single avionics bay. A pressurised refuelling system, developed by Flight Refuelling Ltd, allowed the Comet's fuel tanks to be refuelled at a far greater rate than other methods.|$|E
5|$|The {{maintenance}} of Taman Sari was abandoned shortly after Hamengkubuwono I died, {{partly because the}} elaborate <b>hydraulic</b> works were so difficult to maintain. The gardens were neglected and the buildings suffered some damage during the Java War of 1825–1830.|$|E
5|$|The ride had {{constant}} downtime in {{its first}} couple seasons. Several problems such as the ride's <b>hydraulic</b> system and launch cable caused the ride to experience downtime. Top Thrill Dragster was also closed in 2003 for the annual event, CoasterMania.|$|E
25|$|The <b>hydraulic</b> circuit, {{which has}} <b>hydraulic</b> pumps, reservoirs, filters, pipes, valves and {{actuators}}. The actuators are {{powered by the}} <b>hydraulic</b> pressure generated by the pumps in the <b>hydraulic</b> circuit. The actuators convert <b>hydraulic</b> pressure into control surface movements. The electro-hydraulic servo valves control {{the movement of the}} actuators.|$|E
25|$|Single {{cylinder}} <b>hydraulic</b> {{cone crusher}} is mainly composed of main frame, transmission device, eccentric shaft, bowl-shaped bearing, crushing cone, mantle, bowl liner, adjusting device, adjusting sleeve, <b>hydraulic</b> control system, <b>hydraulic</b> safety system, dust-proof ring, feed plate, etc.|$|E
25|$|By definition, <b>hydraulic</b> {{conductivity}} is {{the ratio}} of velocity to <b>hydraulic</b> gradient indicating permeability of porous media.|$|E
25|$|A <b>hydraulic</b> power {{network is}} a system of {{interconnected}} pipes carrying pressurized liquid used to transmit mechanical power from a power source, like a pump, to <b>hydraulic</b> equipment like lifts or motors. The system is analogous to an electrical grid transmitting power from a generating station to end-users. Only a few <b>hydraulic</b> power transmission networks are still in use; modern <b>hydraulic</b> equipment has a pump built into the machine. In the late 19th century, a <b>hydraulic</b> network might {{have been used in}} a factory, with a central steam engine or water turbine driving a pump and a system of high-pressure pipes transmitting power to various machines.|$|E
25|$|Independent <b>hydraulic</b> power {{networks}} were also installed at Hull's docks - both the Albert Dock (1869), and Alexandra Dock (1885) installed <b>hydraulic</b> generating stations and accumulators.|$|E
25|$|Liquid is {{the primary}} {{component}} of <b>hydraulic</b> systems, which take advantage of Pascal's law to provide fluid power. Devices such as pumps and waterwheels {{have been used to}} change liquid motion into mechanical work since ancient times. Oils are forced through <b>hydraulic</b> pumps, which transmit this force to <b>hydraulic</b> cylinders. Hydraulics can be found in many applications, such as automotive brakes and transmissions, heavy equipment, and airplane control systems. Various <b>hydraulic</b> presses are used extensively in repair and manufacturing, for lifting, pressing, clamping and forming.|$|E
25|$|With {{the rapid}} {{development}} of mining technology, the cone crusher {{can be divided}} into four types: compound cone crusher, spring cone crusher, <b>hydraulic</b> cone crusher and gyratory crusher. According to different models, the cone crusher is divided into VSC series cone crusher (compound cone crusher), Symons cone crusher, PY cone crusher, single cylinder <b>hydraulic</b> cone crusher, multi-cylinder <b>hydraulic</b> cone crusher, gyratory crusher, etc.|$|E
25|$|Differences in <b>hydraulic</b> head (h) cause {{water to}} move from one place to another; water flows from {{locations}} of high h to locations of low h. <b>Hydraulic</b> head is composed of pressure head (ψ) and elevation head (z). The head gradient is the change in <b>hydraulic</b> head per length of flowpath, and appears in Darcy's law as being proportional to the discharge.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} engineering applications of the <b>hydraulic</b> jump is to dissipate energy in channels, dam spillways, and similar structures so that the excess kinetic energy does not damage these structures. The rate of energy dissipation or head loss across a <b>hydraulic</b> jump {{is a function of the}} <b>hydraulic</b> jump inflow Froude number and the height of the jump.|$|E
