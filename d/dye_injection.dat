Here we analyze our methylene blue <b>dye</b> <b>injection</b> method to localize reoperative neck pathology in patients with thyroid cancer and lymph node metastases. Study Design: We retrospectively reviewed the records of all patients at a single university tertiary care center who had reoperative neck surgery for recurrent thyroid cancer between 2004 and 2009, and who also underwent intraoperative methylene blue <b>dye</b> <b>injection.</b> Outcomes measured were efficacy and safety of the injection technique as well as complication rates. Results: Fifty-three operations were performed in 44 patients (average age, 51. 2 years [range 16 to 83 years]). Ninety-one percent (48 of 53) of the operations resulted in successful resection of recurrent disease. Of these, 96 % (46 of 48) were guided successfully by blue <b>dye</b> <b>injection.</b> Thyroglobulin became undetectable in 42 % (11 of 26) of patients. Neck pathology included the following thyroid cancers: papillary (48 of 53), follicular (2 of 53), medullary (2 of 53), and tall cell variant (1 of 53). Among these patients, there were a total of 26 central and 38 lateral neck dissections. The average number of previous neck dissections was 2 (range 1 to 5). The mean intraoperative ultrasound/injection time was 21. 3 min (n = 13). Median operative time was 90 minutes (range 40 to 300 minutes). Complications included 2 permanent vocal cord paralyses, 1 instance of permanent hypocalcemia, and 3 instances of temporary hypocalcemia.

However, detailed analyses reveal a large diurnal variability in terms of transit velocity and dispersion coefficient. This finding underlines the difficulty of detecting a possible drainage system evolution based on single tracer tests conducted at coarse temporal intervals.

The {{aim of this}} study was to identify clinical evidence about the reliability of this technique in the recent literature. METHODS: We performed a Medline search for articles published during the last 10 years, using the key words "varicocele," "treatment," and "adolescent. " As limits, we used last 10 years, adolescent, clinical trials, randomized controlled trials, meta-analysis, and multicenter retrospective and prospective studies. The results were investigated in recurrence and hydrocele formation. RESULTS: We pooled 37 studies, but 26 of these were excluded because they were neither relevant nor concerned an adolescent population. Meta-analysis showed that there was no statistical difference between laparoscopic surgery and open surgery in recurrence rate and postoperative hydrocele rate.

40|$|Background: Chemical {{communication}} plays {{a critical}} role in sexual selection and speciation in fishes; however, it is generally assumed that most fish pheromones are passively released since most fishes lack specialized scent glands or scent-marking behavior. Swordtails (genus Xiphophorus) are widely used in studies of female mate choice, and female response to male chemical cues is important to sexual selection, reproductive isolation, and hybridization. However, it is unclear whether females are attending to passively produced cues, or to pheromones produced in the context of communication. Methodology/Principal Findings: We used fluorescein <b>dye</b> <b>injections</b> to visualize pulsed urine release in male sheepshead swordtails, Xiphophorus birchmanni. Simultaneous-choice assays of mating preference showed that females attend to species- and sex-specific chemical cues emitted in male urine. Males urinated more frequently in the presence and proximity of an audience (conspecific females). In the wild, males preferentially courted upstream of females, facilitating transmission of pheromone cues. Conclusions/Significance: Males in a teleost fish have evolved sophisticated temporal and spatial control of pheromone release, comparable to that found in terrestrial animals. Pheromones are released specifically in a communicative context, and the timing and positioning of release favors efficient signal transmission...|$|R

When the nozzle-to-plate spacing is less than the nozzle diameter, the frequency of occurance of ring vortices is remarkably effected by the impingement plate. With increasing nozzle-to-plate spacing, the frequency of transport of ring vortices decreases due to the coalescence of vortices and the turbulence in the boundary layer increases...|$|E

A new on‐table <b>dye</b> <b>injection</b> technique has been introduced to determine the venous drainage of the gallbladder and ascertain the amount of liver to remove. MethodsIn four hepatic resections for pT 2 gallbladder cancer, indocyanine green solution (25 mg/ 20 ml) was injected {{over a period of}} 30 seconds through the cystic artery. The stained area of the liver surface was completely resected, maintaining a margin of at least 2 cm from the gallbladder. ResultsThe entire serosal surface of the gallbladder takes on a light green stain immediately after <b>dye</b> <b>injection,</b> and then the liver surface around the gallbladder gradually becomes stained with a clear demarcation line. The distance between the demarcation line and the gallbladder ranged from 1. 0 to 5. 0 cm. The extent of the stained area differed from one individual to another. Histopathological examination of resected liver specimens revealed that one of the four resected livers had micrometastasis in the portal area 27 mm from the gallbladder wall and there were no cancer cells at the surgical margins. No recurrence has been seen in any of our 4 patients at 16 – 26 months after operation.

40|$|By using a {{combination}} of <b>dye</b> <b>injections,</b> clonal labeling, and molecular markers, we have reconstructed the axonal connections between brain and ventral nerve cord of the first-instar Drosophila larva. Out of the approximately 1, 400 neurons that form the early larval brain hemisphere, less than 50 cells have axons descending into the ventral nerve cord. Descending neurons fall into four topologically defined clusters located in the anteromedial, anterolateral, dorsal, and basoposterior brain, respectively. The anterolateral cluster represents a lineage derived from a single neuroblast. Terminations of descending neurons are almost exclusively found in the anterior part of the ventral nerve cord, represented by the gnathal and thoracic neuromeres. This region also contains small numbers of neurons with axons ascending into the brain. Terminals of the ascending axons are found in the same basal brain regions that also contain descending neurons.

We model the adsorption of a carboxylic acid (formic acid) on anatase (101), (001), (100), (110) and (103) surfaces using density functional theory calculations, and calculate electron injection times from a model dye into these surfaces. We find that the different positions of the conduction band edge of these surfaces determine the rate of electron injection (which is faster for the surfaces with lower-lying conduction band, among them the most stable (101) surface). However, if the <b>dye's</b> <b>injection</b> energy is enforced to be at a fixed energy deep inside each surface's conduction band, then several anatase surfaces, such as the synthetically achievable (001) surface, show rates of injection comparable or faster than the (101) surface. Moreover, because of their higher-lying conduction bands, these minority surfaces are likely to offer higher open-circuit voltages in dye-sensitised solar cells. Therefore, synthetically accessible high-energy anatase surfaces, such as (001) -oriented nanostructures, may be promising candidates for use in dye-sensitised solar cells...|$|R
40|$|The ball {{cratering}} {{test was used}} to study the abrasive wear resistance {{of a wide variety of}} coatings against TiO 2 Particles. The rutile TiO 2, used as white pigment, causes mild abrasive wear in mixers, <b>dyes,</b> <b>injection</b> moulds and other components in the paint and plastic processing. The tests yield a clear ranking of the coatings. The abrasive wear due to the rutile particles is also compared to the wear induced by SiC particles commonly used for {{ball cratering}} tests. Differences in the wear mechanism using the latter are demonstrated. Furthermore, the calculation methods to derive the coating and substrate wear coefficients from the wear volume measurements have been critically reviewed. It can be concluded that the methods are especially useful for determining the wear coefficient in the coating. However, the substrate wear coefficient cannot be accurately determined when the wear resistance of the substrate is much lower than that of the coating. It is shown that the ball cratering test is not restricted to polished samples, but remains useful for moderate roughness as applicable to the desired components. (C) 2003 Elsevier B. V.
